            "body": "Quick suggestion, since you said you're a new redditor:  A long post is infinitely more readable if you add in line breaks and split it up into paragraphs rather than one big wall of text.\n\n---\n\nThis is my first post in this subreddit and first post ever in Reddit. I've read through a lot of the other stories here, and I decided to share mine. This story takes place solely on Discord. A few months after I made an account and joined multiple RPing servers (one being one of my favourite YouTuber's), I got into some RPs. Most of them died off and one was a little to biased for older players. I decided to make my own with some friends I knew in real life. \n\nAfter a while, I started gaining members and they made new RPs with my permissions. It was fun, but I felt out of place in most of them. Enter A, because I'm so good at coming up with names. Anyway, A was hanging around in the YouTuber's server. He posted a short emote in the server's random RPing channel, where anyone could join in whenever and to pretty much anything. We started RPing together and it got to the point where I decided to bring it to my server. We both became DMs since we both started it. \n\nThe RP became a hit immediately. I had a great time during the weeks the RP flourished. Then, things took a turn for the worse because of A. He was DMing an NPC that was a sympathetic soldier in the evil faction, which actually fit and could be interesting. It also added to the plight of said faction's troops. He did it very well, at first. Until his character made a stupid decision. \n\nThe group comes upon a bunch of bodies, and a patrol is fast approaching. My NPC said that the patrol had beasts that could sniff them out and started covering himself in blood. The other PCs followed, except for the NPC that was controlled by A. He tried to carry a child and run to safety. The patrol had horses and beasts that would smell them. His character calls us fools and doesn't get far. The NPC distracts the patrol long enough for the boy to escape, but is captured and flayed to set an example. He is tied to a pole and left at the side of a road. \n\nThe PCs eventually find him, and one tries to put A's NPC out of his misery. The NPC convinces them to let him die fighting. Right after being flayed and left out for a few hours. Bring the inexperienced DM and guy who wanted no conflict, I let it slide. His character proceeds to hold off an entire patrol unarmoured and bleeding to death and in shock. He also kills \"dozens of orcs\". Heavily armoured orcs. \n\nThe chat dies for a bit until I move things along. NPC eventually gets killed. Everything is going well until the final battle. Just as everyone is getting into it and an epic duel is about to happen, A uses his DM character (which is an OP god). He nukes the whole world and brings a few characters into his own worlds. The RP died very quickly after that. \n\nI decided to bring it back months later through restarting. A makes his DM character narrate resetting the Universe. His character narrates a few times after, all of it poorly done and cringy. It was at this point that I realized how bad he was. Run on sentences, bland characters, inconsistent ones, poor dialog, etc. In the YouTuber's server, he said he would only find happiness in killing a moderator's girlfriend and long time member of the server. He leaves right after. \n\nI looked back through his messages, and it turns out he butted into everything. Literally everything. He always has to get a word in. In a channel meant for serious topics, he copies and pastes vaguely relevant quotes from Google and tries to sound deep. He only managed to annoy everyone. Me, being the idiot that I am, let it slide. His non-DM characters are all inconsistent and keeps using stupid excuses for it. After a while, the original members of the RP rejoin. \n\nEnter B. He was great at RPing. He was polite and a very nice guy OOC. Some of his emotes actually made me feel something. We became good friends and we RPed frequently. One day, A uses his DM character to take over a large region. All of the annoyance and anger in me from before erupts. I grill him out in private messages. \n\nI'll be honest, I was also partially responsible for making the RP die before. I rushed the plot, metagamed and godmoded a few times, but I changed. I realized that I was being a shitty RM and changed. My DM character was reluctant to fight and had his power diminished. He pulled the strings from the shadows. I stretched thingd out, made multiple arcs and got in some good character development for PCs and my NPCs. A, however, did not change. \n\nI go off on him about how inconsistent his characters are, how he is annoying and why he sucked as a DM. He left my server after. I apologized, and he agreed to rejoin. He removed his DM character and sticks to his PCs. Things go smoothly again, until he starts being an idiot, once more. A group of the faction's troops get drunk and harass a PC. There is no drink in the fortress aside from water as the commanders don't want their men drunk. He does it anyway, because he started the RP. The thing is, everyone would have ignored him and there would be no RP. \n\nBack on track. There is a big fire near a forest, and one of his NPCs wants to investigate. Against orders. He tries to jump his horse over the fortress's walls. That's right. A fortress where only a few emotes ago, I described how tall it was (taller three elephants stacked on top of each other). I correct him and he changes it. \n\nMeanwhile, I am having a lot of fun with B. He becomes a moderator quickly due to his activity and friendliness. He also became comfortable enough to share that he had depression with my server in the serious discussion channel. We all supported him. And I always listened when he ranted and offered advice. This becomes important, later. \n\nThe RP takes a turn for the worse when A wants to use a new and even more powerful DM character. At this point, I suspected he had a god complex or something. His character had invisible assassins all over the game world and an overpowered army with unlimited troops. I was afraid it would be a repeat of last time. He could have ended the RP whenever he wanted, and was planning to. \n\nI told all of the players who were in that RP that were currently online to get him to stop, B included, in a group chat. Instead of listening to us and responding, A attacks B in private messages. He then goes to the group chat and tells B to \"stop acting special\"and to \"get off his high horse and onto the ground like the rest of us\". Needless to say, I was speechless and infuriated. I banned him on the spot. \n\nA became a source of constant stress and anger for everyone. He rejoined the YouTuber's server, which B was also in, and acted like nothing happened. I lost my temper and went off on him a few times in front of the whole server. After each time, he would call me an asshole in private messages and try to sound deep. He had so many different ways of saying I can't forgive. He tried to play victim and got pissed at me for taking B's issues seriously. He also acted extremely edgy in PMs with me. I ignore him and we go on with our lives. \n\nUntil a month ago. He asks to rejoin after weeks of being pretty nice. I, in my infinite wisdom, added him back. I had to reassure B that things would be fine. Not a day after rejoining, he wants to DM again. He says that I am ignorant and that my server would be dead without him. I tell him to stop feeding his ego and we get into an argument. No one leaves, and we sort of make up. Eventually, he asks for another channel for his RP. I make one, he posts an intro and no one emotes. \n\nI decide to delete along with one of his other unsuccessful RPs. I asked him if he wanted to see anything change in my server, as every other member said \"It's great the way it is.\" He says his opinion doesn't matter and B joins in, saying that it does and asks for feedback. I get an angry PM from A telling me to tell B, a moderator, to stay out of server business. I laugh it off and he PMs B, asking how my dick tastes. \n\nA leaves and throws a tantrum. I forget to revoke his invite and he rejoins and tries to apologize. B, who is still angry, talks to him in my server and it spirals out of control. A ends up going to PMs and calls B a child who can't forgive and B ignores him. And that brings us to now. Just needed to rant. Some advice is also welcome.",
