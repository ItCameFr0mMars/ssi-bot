Bonus points if what they're doing is specifically a solitary activity like reading a book or explicitly refusing to engage others.\n\nPerson 3 joins the RP and begins interacting with Person 1.\n\nPerson 1 and 3 begin RPing together.\n\nPerson 2 posts something irrelevant.\n\nPerson 1 and 3 keep RPing.\n\nPerson 2 stops posting.\n\nPerson 1 and 3 keep RPing.

He might have started in such an ambiguous setting to prevent godmodding your character.

So I chose to do what I felt was IC for my character in that situation - which is to not stop and instigate a conversation with someone who's essentially a stranger for absolutely no reason when she clearly has other things she's preoccupied with.\n\nThere were also other problems with the character that I hinted at in my post but didn't go into detail about - I requested a kind-hearted and serious college professor and what I got was a cocky playboy type who barely made it through college himself and I'm honestly not sure how he even got his job, more or less how he kept it? These things weren't obvious in his app at first (though looking back on it after seeing him being written in posts, I should have seen it coming).\n\nSo suffice to say I didn't feel particularly motivated to go out of my way to make this work when the person snagged my request and then fulfilled very little of it.",
