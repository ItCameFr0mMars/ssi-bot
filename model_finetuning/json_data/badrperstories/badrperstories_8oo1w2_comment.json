I personally am all for games that ban bigoted stuff, because especially marginalized folks (I am disabled and trans) don't always want to have to deal with our real-life trauma in games we're using as escapism. (And often feel shitty if our pain is used as \"flavor\" for folks who haven't experienced it.)\n\nBut you asking about someone's age makes perfect sense to me, especially if like... Their partner is an adult. I would not be comfortable role-playing with folks who wanted to play out a pedophilic relationship. Although, it could be they thought you were associating gay relationships with pedophilia, which is a problem... But I don't think they have a leg to stand on there since you were bringing up age because of baby talk, not because they're both women. \n\nSome groups can be really toxic, and not accepting someone's concern over sexual abuse or not wanting to potentially see romantic/sexual role-play between two characters seems messed up to me. If they weren't going for an exhibition based thing (which if they were they need to make sure other players are okay with that) then you saying a private chat was made public is an extremely good thing, saving them from having their private stuff aired. \n\nThe DM punishing you for wanting to know a player's age and not wanting to be a part of private sex chatting is messed up, if that's the kind of thing that flies there you may want to find another group.
