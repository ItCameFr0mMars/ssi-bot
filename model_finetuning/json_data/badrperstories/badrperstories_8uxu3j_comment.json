            "body": "I suggest not trying to go thru the GM, other players or staff or whatever, and just voice your concerns to the person directly.  If you explain your point of view to them, they may give up the character as you request, but maybe you need to understand their point of view as well.  Talking thru it is the only way to find out.  I would bet it is not a lack of interest but a lack of time or other life priorities that get in the way of them playing, otherwise they likely wouldn't continue to allow you to use their infrastructure.  They want to come back, but can't or have too personal baggage on their mind preventing them from engaging fully - you never know.  They might not know either, some people lack the introspection required to determine that.\n\nFor example, I haven't played Skyrim for a year, but I'm not about to uninstall it to clear up needed disk space, because I want to get back to it eventually.  But at least in my case I am only hurting the feelings of other games I try to install and don't have enough disk space for.",

I would straight up ask if they would just drop the character. Tell them what you've noticed about their of activity on this muse while they're pretty active on another. It sounds like you wouldn't even be mad about the drop but it would be some ease off of you knowing that you don't have to wait around for this person to maybe/maybe not response with their muse. It isn't fair to you and it would be nice if people in general were more honest about these types of things. Don't wanna write this character any more? Cool, I'm dropping to focus on this or that. Yet for some reason, they find it easier to just let that poor muse sit around in the dust. ",
