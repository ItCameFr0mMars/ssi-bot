Perhaps their personal experience made them believe that such a thing was not normally possible (especially without mixed ethnicity).  \n\nPerhaps the other players were expecting a down to earth game, and perceived your insistence on having a blonde Korean as \"I want to be the chosen one, born from a unicorn, and marked from birth as destined to slay the dragon.\"  \n\nUnusual hair colors, eye colors, and heterochromia are all superficial and much more common in roleplaying games than reality.  Such traits don't truly make characters unique, and reliance on them can be symptomatic of a lack of depth in the character.  \n\nI would guess that these points are more likely to be why the others would have objected to the blonde Korean, than some form of racial stereotyping.",
