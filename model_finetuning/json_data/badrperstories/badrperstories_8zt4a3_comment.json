Invariably they would be terrible RPers, and often times the most foul-mouthed and inappropriate members. Gotta prove you're an \"adult\" by being vulgar and offensive, I guess. \n\nNot just kiddies, but a fair subsection of RPers just show up wanting a dating sim in their universe/setting of choice. At one RP it got particularly bad to the point the RP was more or less divided in half by \"shippers\" who just wanted to RP dating and marrying someone, and \"plotters\" who wanted actual interesting shit to happen.

There are adults who bail without any word too, but I've noticed that with teens in general, any time a newer, shiner fandom comes up and has a ton of people following it, they want to be a part of that bigger \"something\" so they leave without thinking twice. However, I have also encountered the \"too young to RP\" individuals with terrible spelling and grammar, but they were often flanked by who wrote just like them: short spurts of sentences, godmodding like there was no tomorrow, nonsense plots that went nowhere, etc. I get it, they just want to have fun and not take themselves so seriously, but at the same time, some of us do want to focus on actual plotting, so we just steer clear of those younger RPers unless they come to us and prove they want to write more serious material.
