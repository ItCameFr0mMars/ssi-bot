            "body": "This is a really tough situation, and I want to start by saying that I don't think that this is 100% on you in spite of the fact that a fair chunk is your responsibility. \n\nIf someone is making you uncomfortable, the exact thing _not_ to do is stay quiet and just go along with it hoping that the person who is making you uncomfortable will just intuit what you want and stop. The other thing that you do not do is subtly hint and dance around the problem that your partner is making you uncomfortable. \n\nIMO, Green should have told you straight up that they weren't having fun any more with the threads with Red and that you guys needed to try something else. \n\nIt's uncomfortable as hell to do that, but you (general you) have to do it. RP is give and take and if no one says anything to me about being uncomfortable with a thread or with my character, I will not be able to know. \n\nAre there times where I will suck it up for the sake of a friendship or because I can't be bothered causing a potential issue with someone I know I won't be RPing with again? Absolutely. But, if it's a long-standing plot or I know that I will continue with someone past a single thread... then I will and I have told people that X had to change because I wasn't enjoying what was happening and it was a chore to write.\n\nSo! That said and done, if you want to remain a part of your RP group and repair your relationships, you hit the nail on the head - you can't go back and uncrumple that piece of paper to make it brand new again. You just can't. \n\nSo, if I was in your shoes I would approach Green's player and ask them (and possibly White's player) how they would like to resolve the plot between Red, Green, and White and how you can all move on from it. I would be upfront too and tell them that you want to know when you're making someone uncomfortable and that you can't always tell from subtle signs or if they don't say anything to you directly. Give them an opening to be able to say that they're uncomfortable. And frankly, as I said, that's part of Green's job as an RP partner - to communicate with you. \n\nGoing forward, I don't know what kind of game it is, but when I'm a playing a character who is an ass I always warn people ahead of time. Especially if I don't know the player super well, I usually always warn them that X action will result in Y consequence, and if that's an issue for the other player, then we'll put our heads together and think of something else! Basically, it can end up in a lot of DMing back and forth when you're constantly checking in, but that way you've covered your bases and you've checked to make sure that what's happening in the thread is making everyone at the table happy before you have your character pull a dick move.\n\ntl;dr It's not all on you, people need to communicate when they're uncomfortable. Talk OOCly with Green and White and see if you can come to a solution in the plot that makes everyone happy, encourage Green to come to you with problems in the future, and DM people frequently if your character is going to be a massive PITA.",

The most mature thing you can do, and the only thing you can do to proce that you have changed, is to drop it. Leave Green and White alone, stop trying to force them to interact with you because YOU need to feel better. Swallow your hurt, and start being a better person, and better RP'er.\n\nAlso,  read the Vampire the Masquerade Players Guide (Revised edition) like your new Bible (it's about being a better roleplayer in general, not just Vampire).
