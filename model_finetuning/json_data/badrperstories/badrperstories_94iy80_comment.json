I was super excited and we came up with a simple plot that would allow our muses (mine was also from canon) to interact. I was so hyped, I was ready to get things rolling, I even offered to create the starter... and then that other person deactivated the very next day. No warning, no nothing. Quite discouraging to say the least. \n\nMaybe something happens on that other person's end to where they can't write anymore, or maybe they lost interest even after other people showing interest in writing with them. Still, people should leave even a quick message saying that they can't/won't write before disappearing without a trace.  ",

And I don\u2019t even mind waiting longer for posts to come up (I\u2019m a slow writer, myself, so I\u2019m fine with waiting for up to a month for people to reply). What bothers me is ghosting. If we were doing a dumb chat style RP and you ended up ghosting me then sure, that\u2019s fine, whatever. But to ask me to build something with you, and actually put effort I could have spent elsewhere, only for it all to be for nothing? Why?? Why even involve yourself in those kinds of RPs if you don\u2019t have the energy/dedication for them? There are a lot of rapid fire or semi lit style RPs that would better suit someone who just wants some quick fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that?? ",
