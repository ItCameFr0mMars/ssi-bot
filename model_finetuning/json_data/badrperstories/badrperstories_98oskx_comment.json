It's like they want something to do, but they don't want to join any of the open RPs. But when offered a dozen different things, none of them are what they want. But they can't articulate what they want. So they sulk around the OOC chat because no one will make the RP thread that they really want. And no one knows what they want because they can't say what they want. We also get a fair number who are all \"I'm too nervous to make an RP, someone make one that I can join\" then they refuse to join any of the ones made to meet them because \"nah that's not what I want\". \n\n",

This one just stands out as being one of the most notable in my recent roleplay history for not seeming to want to cooperate with other people too much.  \n\n\nReally hoping we can find a way to accommodate or they can adapt to the site environment here before too long. It seems like maybe there is also just a disconnect between what they are interested in playing and what most of the established members are interested in. I think most of us ere toward character drama and development and trying to find interesting relationship dynamics... and we're all a bunch of hopeless shippers a lot of the time. They seem to just be wanting to play slice of life sort of moments without much intrigue to them. And has also made more passive aggressive comments about characters they think should be doing other things having threads for ships instead as if they never get played for anything else, which they do. AKA 'why is your character doing the thing you find interesting instead of the thing I think it would be interesting for them to do.' That was after only a few days on site.  \n\n\nStill trying to be hopeful, though.",
