Sounds like you might have a case of that on your hands, alongside the previous godmodding you mentioned in your last post. I'd suggest talking through it with her again, letting her know how you feel in a gentle manner and suggesting that you work collaboratively on a story instead of playing to one person's rules. If that doesn't work, it's up to you whether you want to continue or not.",

You said you wanted to follow the 'Full Moon' rule; did they know that? OOC communications are king; Ive opened lines of communication apart from RP with all my partners and it helps things go so much smoother, sometimes we'll spend more time just talking about RP or just shootin'-the-shit rather than RPing which is fine because just like any other writing those breaks and brainstorms are important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read your 'last post'; without seeing how it was written I'd have a hard time saying if it was godmodding or not. If she suggested that maybe your MC would be shifting then no godding, if she says \"Your MC shifts\" then maybe but it could just be something thrown in for you to spur ideas for you. Also is this a mutual story telling or are one of you taking role as storyteller? You say that she seems to have everything planned out already so why don't you ask what she has in mind then you can yay or nay them and offer your own ideas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can tell you I've had partners that seem to only want me there to be an NPC in their story; I find in my experience that most people are just excited about their characters and plot lines and just need to be reminded that they are working with someone else who is just as excited about their own stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly there are just some people whos styles of writing/ RP just doesn't mesh; in that case its best to peacefully part ways and search for a partner you do work well with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps and good luck.",
