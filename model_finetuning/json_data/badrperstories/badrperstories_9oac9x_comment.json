It's so annoying and there's no way to react to it.

My character was a yellow reporter kind of like Rita Skeeter who loves twisting a good story. Another was an aspiring Sheriff, an underappreciated 16 year old photographer and then the Sherriffs love interest. Through an extremely elaborate chain of event we set off to solve the mystery and catch the culprit, all with different motivations in mind.\n\nHours. I'm talking hours of buildup and set up on this..  I\u2019ll spare you the entire ordeal, but what I\u2019m trying to say was it was many and much.  We were all really involved in our characters and making sure they never made a single move without proper motivation. We followed false leads that ooc we knew would be leading nowhere etc. It was a lot and it was fun.\n\nThis kid was in the OOC chat saying \u201cYou\u2019ll never catch me\u201d blahblah. We were like \u201cWe\u2019ll see\u201d\n\nWe thought it\u2019d be a chase, a mystery, a game of cat and mouse..\n\nNope.\n\nIn one massive post, this boy.. OML this boiii..\n\nHe blew up the warehouse they were hiding in, **played his partner** who was afk, played his NPC goons. Played the cops who showed up and himself interacting with them. Gave them two NPCs who he framed for the crime, was given a hero award by the police department and closed the case completely, then changed his face and disappeared.\n\nI was floored when I read the post. Did he really just kill an entire play in one post because he was afraid we would catch him IC?\n\nHe did.\n\nNow I/we could have continued.. could have dug herder to find sooooome reason to get him but I was done. Toasted. Kaput. And furthermore, I didnt want to play with him anymore.\n\nThat was actually the death of a really great group because I stopped putting in effort. It was the straw that broke the camels back, so to say haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhats one of your stories?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "body": "Ooooh frien...\n\nI encountered a player back in the day... we'll call her Tisket (since no one I hope is using that as a name LOL). Tisket played one of the many droves of kemonomimi characters one encounters these days. (They are not a favorite of mine, but to each their own.)\n\nMy character was a medical doctor and also a powerful metahuman with psionic abilities. We'll call him Tasket. Tisket became fixated on Tasket and, despite my having him say 'I don't find animal bits attractive on my ladies', still managed to importune me OOC and Tasket IC into allowing a relationship to develop. We all get surprised; no harm no foul. \n\nThing about me with IC relationships... I prefer them to remain stable, most times, unless it's agreed on that there can be some conflict or infidelity or whatever. And Tisket's player knew this because she had seen the fallout when Tasket got his heart broken by an  unfaithful partner. She had also had more than one conversation with me OOC about how frustrating I find things like that. It's plain Not Fun for me, and had I known it was one of her requirements, I would have made Tasket's initial 'take that tail elsewhere' speech stick.\n\nTisket (unbeknownst to me at that time) had a real fetish for 'damsel imperiled' storylines, preferably ones that 1. the peril was her own damn fault for taking some stupidass risk and 2. involved lots and lots of rape/sexual slavery/whatever. Again, not a thing I am a huge fan of, regardless of what part I am expected to portray.\n\nSo... Tisket not only sets herself up to have a lovely evening of being used and abused (probably whilst frantically spanking the clam)... she has this happen *without asking me* if I feel like dropping the main-continuity arc to go haring off after her when Tasket damn well told her to stay where she was due to an injury sustained during the *last* foolish endeavor she had undertaken. \n\nAnd on top of *that*, she utilizes a former play partner (we will call him Basket) that she knew Tasket did not like IC, and I did not like OOC. Why? Because Basket was a huuuuuge powerplayer. Like... tried to state that his character was older and more powerful than the primary male deity in the in-game pantheon, a being that was effectively a personification of the Big Bang. So she had Basket kidnap her to do all manner of vile things in, on and to her, expecting me to have Tasket white-knight off after her.\n\nAnd I said 'Nope, that dawg don't hunt' and had Tasket say 'He is too powerful for me to defeat and I have to stay alive for the sake of the rest of the settlement'.\n\nTisket and Basket didn't like that. And so they did their level best to basically destroy the game from within... and I got fed the hell up and just left the site entirely. Subsequently, they both got banned for other fuckery that involved the two of them attempting to doxx another player.\n\nWhew.",

I\u2019ve been on your side, posting then starts to feel like a chore instead of something enjoyable. \n\nCommunication for good roleplay is so very very essential. \u201cWhat kinds of things would make this most enjoyable for you? Here are some things that I really like. Here are some things that I really don\u2019t like.\u201d \n\nIf a player ignores that stuff then I kindly step awwwaaayyy\n\n\u201cSpanking the clam\u201d lol \n\nI like how you resolved it. It\u2019s poetic almost.. Baskets quest to be the best ruined his play \n\nGlad karma caught up with them.\n\nWhat about the wallowers haha those ones drive me nuts too. The ones who always want their characters consoled in RP. They make it painful to play with them, especially when no matter what you do.. they will still wallow and subtlety manipulate you into caretaking for them -rolls eyes-\n\nI could go on for days. I\u2019ve met so many players who have such disregard for roleplay decorum it\u2019s mind blowing. Though I have met some really down to earth, cognizant players who are as much fun to watch play as they are to play with.  \n",
