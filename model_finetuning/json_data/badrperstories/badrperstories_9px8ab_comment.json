If you don't feel you can, or if it's only you who thinks it's a problem, you may have to just suck it up and put up with things as they are.\n\nOtherwise, maybe scrap the story and start a new one. Make up some reason, for instance say this particular plot isn't going to work with these characters after all.\n\nThen whoever is running the thing assigns roles (not characters, but roles, unless it's a fandom RP) before characters are created, and in the new story no one person holds so much power over the action. It's a bad idea to have a \"central character\" like that anyway, for the reasons you're discovering. But also, if that one person gets sick, or goes on vacation or is suddenly overwhelmed at school or work, then the whole RP crashes and burns. \n\nIf it's a fandom RP, and it _has_ to have this central character, maybe someone can give her a sort of checklist of things her character should think about trying to accomplish for the story, and flatter her ego by explaining that her character is driving a lot of the plot because she's the \"main character\", so everyone's relying on her. Maybe if she had some vague, generalized directions on things she could do then she'd be more interactive.\n\nSorry you're stuck in this situation. I've been in a similar one, where one person insisted on a character that didn't fit, was insanely overpowered and did stupid things that ruined the plot, but we were all friends and nobody wanted to hurt his feelings.
