Details of being a vampire and what that entails aside, people didn\u2019t like to acknowledge her reservations and subsequent depression in their interactions. After a few interactions, you\u2019d think they\u2019d cotton on the the sort of attitude to expect and tailor their banter accordingly. Instead, I got lots of people who were just _shocked_ for the third time that she resisted, say, tagging along on a shopping trip to [populated area] where people would see her and she logically might even be attacked if she ran into a zealot. Or not wanting to go to some big gathering at the behest of an acquaintance where just anyone could show up, and for all she knew it might be a trap.\n\nI get that with a character like her who doesn\u2019t want out of their safety bubble, it\u2019s very important to give openings to keep the action going, or otherwise you end up with a brick wall, and that\u2019s something that was always on my mind when playing her. But in retrospect, the other muns were very frequently tone-deaf about what was being presented to them regardless of character archetype.\n\nI still regret how much caving I did for the sake of letting other muns get what they wanted out of her and \u2018keeping the peace\u2019, and it makes me hesitate to bring VampWitch back anywhere. To be fair, maybe sexism isn\u2019t the right word, but there was definitely something gross going on.",

A few helpful souls actually let him catch them for his experiments, but he never successfully lured anyone with his high charisma because somehow everyone instantly saw through him.
