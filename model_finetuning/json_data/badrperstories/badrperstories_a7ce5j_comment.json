            "body": "Long time lurker, but I have some input on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one forum I'm in, adoptions are commonplace, and the reason why is because how the RP works. The fandom is Battle Royale, but with original characters. If you're unfamiliar, Battle Royale is about a high school class being taken away to fight to the death. So, it's set-up so that there's a specific ranking of who died and when. To prevent someone abruptly introducing a new, never-before-seen-or-mentioned character after the halfway point, character registration is capped early into a specific game.  However, if a mun goes inactive, one of two outcomes can happen. The first is, of course, the mods write out the character's death scene. The other, if the character went inactive relatively early into the game and doesn't have any hugely iffy themes, is for the mods to put them up for adoption. New members, as well as muns from past games who missed sign-ups, have priority, and it's used as a way for them to get a shot at RPing in the setting. Some muns also hand off their characters if they feel they're going to be away for a long time. A few have also assigned a \"babysitter,\" which is essentially a temporary adoption set-up. However, this is not mod-endorsed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn practice, this tends to be pretty hit-and-miss. On one hand, you get muns who do a good job with their new, adopted character and keep them, well, in-character, perhaps with a few road-bumps. Sometimes, they even improve on things. On the other, you also get muns who clearly have a hard time writing for them, or do things like ignore previously established details.  This can result in, for example, them ignoring the death of a character who they were good friends with under their original mun. In the worst case scenario, you get characters who suddenly have mental illnesses that weren't even hinted at right out of nowhere, or a character being used as a soapbox for the new mun to vent about their issues with the forum. Yup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal stance is, again, it can be pretty hit-and-miss. There's a good chance that it might go against the mun's wishes at all for their baby to get handed off. Then there are people who won't care enough to keep them in-character, or do things that are clearly not what the mun would have wanted. But, that said, cases where the mun has full knowledge and consent of what's going on, and the new mun clearly puts the effort in, are groovy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it's a site where such things are not commonplace like what I described, though, and/or it's done in a horrendous or meanspirited way... yeah. That's awful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if it isn't helpful! Just my thoughts on the subject.",

I was then told no, the admin was taking all my characters and playing them herself/distributing them among the others.  At that point it was just confirmation that leaving was the right decision; I had some tough stuff going on IRL and was increasingly less comfortable with some other things on the forum the more I hung out there.
