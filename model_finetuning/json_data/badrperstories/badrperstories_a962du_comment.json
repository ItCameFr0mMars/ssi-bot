A grand majority of the characters weren't his, and many, myself included, made it clear he didn't have permission to do this.  I was not okay with him using our 2 years of work for him to profit off of.  Two days later, he makes an \"OC master post\" where several characters are listed as being \"based on\" characters he did not have permission to use.  I went off on him for it, but he didn't budge.

I guess shows my designs and concepts were somewhat memorable?) \n\nHe responded by saying that he \"improved\" them. Like his versions were better. And... trust me, they're not. This is the kind of guy with more money than common sense, so he *constantly* hires artists to bring his awful ideas to life.

Biggest thieves I've seen liked to use this excuse. Like, of course, there are definitely plenty of things that you cannot make claim of, things that at least someone else has been doing in some form. But there's a line, and it always seems like the people *blatantly* crossing over it are the ones pulling this, \"haha, imagine thinking you own XYZ\" nonsense out of their ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlad to hear that your situation was nipped pretty quickly in the bud though. I actually \"spread the word\" this time myself for once, and most people were pretty supportive, either offering to report this person or refusing to RP with them - or in one case, outright deleting a forum of their own that they had with this person. Definitely sounds like you were dealing with a whole different ballpark though! Yikes.",
