She asked me to write the first post (because of course, they always do) and after I wrote it I got no replies.  For days.  I saw she posted an ad looking for partners again, so I messaged her asking if she was done.  She said no, she still wants to RP, assured me she's super excited about it. \n\nIt's been three days and no word from her.\n\nI don't get it.  Why did you add me if you don't want to RP?  Why bother telling me you're still excited about it?  What are you getting out of this?  Did I offend you in a past life and this is your way of punishing me in the most petty way possible?\n\nAnother guy I added recently wants to RP, but he's never available to set up the story.  I can clearly see he's online and playing PC games, but ignores my messages.  If you don't even have time to discuss the details, why would I ever think you're going to be a reliable partner once the RP starts?\n\nIt's not quite the same as being ghosted I guess.  These people didn't delete me, they just add me and then never respond to me.",

I get ghosting is a massive issue these days (hence why I do my own rp on mmos like Wow where it doesn't matter if people dip or not) and all that, but I am also seeing that rp is causing you a huge amount of stress. You said rp helps you cope with stress, yet you're being stressed even more by shitty rp partners.. Honey, please, if this is a big enough problem that it's causing you stress AND depression... take a break from rp. As someone with chronic depression and anxiety I don't want to see someone else spiral down into it. I'm not saying ghosting is ok, because it's not. Yadda yadda, same thing people have said in this and your last post. My recommendation is to take a small break from rp, and fond something else you like to do. Like write a story for yourself. Because in the end ghosting is bad, but ignoring your mental health to feed the ghosts is even worse. I wish you luck my friend.",
