Roleplays and collab writing's lots of fun but does tend to attract people with their own mishmashes of problems, which can lead to some difficult situations. \n\nWhat I can say here is that you certainly aren't being a 'manipulative liar' here, I won't go on to point any fingers but you definitely aren't manipulating anyone. Others in RP don't have the right to make you worried like this. Granted every group and board has its own struggles and you shouldn't always hit the road at the very first sign of misbehaviour, but I feel like you're not being given much basic respect to your needs here and that's unacceptable.",

            "body": "I've usually RPed through the form of forum RPs. I definitely think you should be wary of individual fora devoted to basically, just one RP, being blunt these have by far the highest chance for nonsense and if things go down the back-end you will have wasted the most amount of time for nothing. But these individual places can be really good as well (imo it's where you get some of the best and some of the worst), you just have to be sure that you've found a lovely group of people there. Even if they might die-out rather quickly, at least for me personally I don't realy mind an RP setting becoming inactive, but I do mind seeing some abysmal drama going-on.\n\nThat brings us on to the large multi-RP forum sites (as well as, to a degree, non-RP based sites which also have a notable sequestered RPing community*). The great thing about these is that you can find practically anything you'd ever want to write-in; you have protection in rare cases of harassment, and if the author(s) of that particular RP turns out to be a 'Class-A Cunt', it doesn't lose you too much to simply say you're withdrawing and join a kinder RP.\n\nThe main problem with them though is that the average turnover of RPs on these kinds of fora is **extremely** high. Unfortunately for me (well, until I took a solid break recently) it's like a sort of drug; I'm hooked on the few times an RP with a bunch of random, pick-up group of individuals turned-out to give me so many good times with them OOC and also gave me a big shot to the arm of being able to watch my character metamorphose in a way I never possibly could've predicted (for better or for worse) having been stretched by the setting and others.\n\nI think there's some really good things about the form and I wouldn't write it off out the gate, but if you're happy with what you have I don't necessarily recommend moving. Forum RP's certainly great if you love creating characters or settings lots, because in that sense you wouldn't really have nothing to lose.\n\n(*Actually I've found these to be the most potentially-awkward of the lot, usually because as the RP sections there lose steam, well-meaning people who don't want to move someplace new start going outside their comfort zone with their RPs and who they write with. Groups mixing like that can lead to some really dreadful clashes of egos, or often just get people a bit annoyed genuinely in that one girl's out here writing 1500 words of her inspecting a slightly-unusual or perhaps-not-unusual-after-all vase; and the next post in the thread is a young lad going 'I walk through the door'. Both writers are gonna justifiably be annoyed in that situation, hehe.)",

Lord knows it's probably the first time I've ever been able to talk about it and maybe not bore everyone *all* the way to tears. ;p\n\nI definitely think the multi-RP forums like Iwaku, Roleplayerguild etc. are generally a much better (and far easier) place to start overall, just because with the 'single (or close enough to) setting' sites you do need a bit of a sense for whether a GM could be like that; further those kind of sites only tend to accommodate a fairly small range of average post-lengths compared to sites where there'll be an RP thread taking 2 sentences and another taking 2 pages next to one another. I will say that I think hard-ass forum GMs are uncommon, but I wouldn't call it rare either. \n\nPersonally I've never been a fan of the sites which have the system of you writing your own (or with your friends) story-threads and then having persistent rewards allocated by a GM when that thread comes to an end, although some people enjoy the freedom and (if desired) solo-writing potential that can offer as well. For me though, I do find it annoying because I watch it discouraging journeyman writers. It just feels like an unnecessary slap on the back for the '1k words of smouldering internal monologue brigade' (i.e, me), ahahaha.\n\nThat's something I forgot to bring-up even in that quite long summary, since there's so many different kinds of RP forums and subforums overall.",

On the Internet in general, you can express in whatever way you like. You don't have to bring-up that you're behind both blogs if you don't want to, if it makes you feel uncomfortable. You don't have to adjust your OC either for them, although I guess it is true that the others around have the choice whether to RP with it or not, it's also their free-time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you're doing and choose to do with this in the future honestly doesn't negatively impact anyone. The only person who might be feeling bad from this is you, so try not to feel as guilty if you can. It's really not manipulation, just to repeat that, so just follow whatever creates the most enjoyable RP and OOC interactions for you if you've got an idea of that, hun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps a bit and sorry for the late reply.",
