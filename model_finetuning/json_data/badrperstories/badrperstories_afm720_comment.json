Some people react to a lack of \"main character plot armor\" by panicking and trying to make OP characters, some by trying to manipulate other players into giving them what they want.  The ideal is to make a character you want to play, at a power level reasonable for the setting, and try and roleplay with people that are going to cooperate with you to tell a story.  If everything's a competition  you might as well just be in PVP in some MMO.",

Actually... mini-story time.\n\nBack in the day, I made a private chat server to act as a character fight club for a larger one. The idea was to have a self-contained tournament bracket where the characters would fight each other and move onto the next opponent based on wins/losses (rinse and repeat as the tournament bracket ends).\n\nHowever, the majority of the server wanted the wins to be predetermined based on... some factor or another. It died before it could take off, but it still kinda bugs me every so often. Why not base the winner on the fight choreography itself? The point of the miniserver was to improve our fight threads, even. \n\nThough... I guess it takes a certain level of personal integrity to play that way. It forces you to pay attention to and be accountable for your characters' actions. But if you're not willing to lose, you probably shouldn't be in a fight thread hub, anyway...",

Instead of imagining how a weaker character could creatively defeat a stronger one, they just go; \"Well logically X is stronger so they win.\" This is a common mentality I've seen in pretty much every Character VS Character thread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common annoyance with RP's in hero worlds for me is the tendency for partner's to bring in logic where it just isn't needed. I get too many conversations that are like;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThem - \"Can you explain the exact source, and function of your character's powers, because they don't really make sense, because \\*science\\*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then depending on how I'm feeling I'll either try to come up with an answer, or I'll just point out that it's a plot device, and doesn't need to be explained.
