It took me almost that long to realize that my storylines with villains and conflicts petered out or got \"fixed\" so fast because of my two main buddies, one of them flat hated any kind of conflict or action that wasn't some sort of interpersonal drama or offscreen harm to be dealt with domestically.  Many of their characters were literally gods, including the same muse that they came back to over and over.  We rebooted the RP universe multiple times, each time I hoped that there would be more stakes and threats, but each time I was disappointed as their main's arc went right back to the same \"becoming a god and fixing all the problems\" story.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe reason was the same, that roleplay was their safe place and serious conflict or action made it feel stressful and unsafe to them.  For a while I messed around playing the silly cat in the nightly \"we're all at this same inn/tavern forever\" session, because these were my friends and I didn't want to give it up, but ultimately I just found it sapping and exhausting.  So I stopped.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe question to ask your friend is: do they actively not want to do plots and conflicts?  And then the question you need to ask yourself is: is safe RP what you want to be doing in seven years?  If the answer is no, you need to consider either doubling them with some other RPers who will give you what you're looking for, or letting them go.",

[Learn from my mistakes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/9qrmte/dont_godmode_my_goddamn_potions_or_why_i_no/)\n\nThough, not everyone is like the horror guy from my story; some people just like different things from you and me, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it sucks to be in a position where you feel you're all-give-no-take. Unfortunately, it can be hard to confront people, but if you never bring up what you want out of RPing, nothing will change.",
