Very few things are more frustrating than spending an entire day crafting a 7000 word intro and then waiting three days to get a 1000 word reply.  And a lot of people will respond like the OP here if you post quickly *regardless* of length and quality.  They feel stressed by it and then they ghost you.  Use Discord and gdocs instead.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is also partly a forum environment's fault.  The first time I joined one no one told me \"Hey, forum RP is only for very slow posters, and posting quickly will get a negative response.\". Everyone knows short posts are hated, but that was all I was ever told.",

            "body": "I would have to *strongly* disagree. For one, a lot of forums out there predate Discord, some of them by over a decade. Would you suggest we pack it up and leave because our medium has somehow been determined to be \"only\" for slow posters?\n\nFor two, who says that quality is determined solely by how eloquently (or verbosely) written the post is? Some of us prefer plot over purple prose, and don't give a crap about the other writers' so-called \"skill\" so long as they have interesting characters and plot ideas. I'd much rather a non-native speaker with understandable but not necessarily technically \"correct\" English who has interesting character interactions than someone who tries to pad word counts for no actual story reason. RP is a collaborative storytelling medium, not a dick-measuring contest over who can fill the most space on a page. \n\nFor three... *what*? A \"lot of people\" will freak out if you post too fast? Most of us don't mind quick replies in the slightest. If you're that stressed by someone responding too quickly, or not writing up to your standards because you think a post should be a literal novella, then stick to one-on-ones and vet your partners. Or look for forums that have rules about that. \n\nAnd lastly, every single forum I have *ever* joined (and it's been a lot) has pretty much been a write at your own pace sort of deal. For some people that means 4-5+ posts a day, often spread across multiple threads. For others, it means posting only a couple times a week. I have never, *ever* heard of any problems coming because someone posts too fast. ",
