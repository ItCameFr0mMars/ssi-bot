On the one hand, I agree with this sentiment because I've skirted with players who were \"professional writers\", but as someone who has two degrees in CW and have been trying to work on their own projects for publications I know there's a big big difference between writing a story and role playing. My approach to writing and interacting is very different because in one I acknowledge I'm controlling everything and \"trying to make a point\" where in the other I'm much more focused on character interaction (and development) and discovering a story as I write with my partners (and doing a lot of, \"What if this happened? What about this concept? Can we do a pa au?\"). Maybe I'm just a special snowflake in regards to this, or maybe it's because I role played for years before studying it academically (and being salty I couldn't take cw in high school because I wanted to be a writer for forever), or maybe it's because I can differentiate between the two (regarding the \"when people can't...\" part of the title), but I guess I felt the need to say something because I wouldn't want to be immediately dismissed because I'm mad passionate about writing. But that said, the last time I tried to role play with another writer they wanted me to be one of their characters (after telling me about them and showing me the stories) and not my own ocs so I quietly noped out.... Actually that's happened more than once now that I think about it. Yck.",

But what really, really grinds my gears is the fact that everyone seems to assume that I'll come up with everything. Every, last, thing. \n\nIt was fine in the beginning, sure. I was new and I can understand if people were expecting me to be active. \n\nFor example, someone messages me if I want to plan with them. Then they proceed to give me absolutely nothing, I ask what characters they want to use? - Everything is fine. What kind of interaction do you want to have? - Everything is fine. Do you have any ideas - Not really. \n\nWELL OKAY?!\n\nUgh. Then I spend time browsing through their characters, try to figure out some kind of interaction that would feel meaningful, throw the idea to them only them to reply something like:\n\nYes! It's great!\n\nIs it? Is it really??\n\nThen they usually expect me to start up the whole thing and in the end, they don't even seem to be super into the plot I came up with. It's so infuriatingly frustrating.  If you don't like my plot then SAY SO. It's called plotting, we are supposed to plot together. \n\nI don't want to write 30 000 words of two characters dicking around doing nothing. Why RP in the first place if you are going to be so unenthusiastic about it? It's like dragging around a dead fish, poking and kicking it so the damn thing appears more lively. ",

Recently I started a new RP that was using my own custom setting on an alien planet, and my partner was supposed to play a human character whose spaceship crash landed there.  I was handling the setting and multiple characters, while she was playing only that one human char.  At one point she told me, \"You can describe the human ship however you like!\"\n\nUm, how about YOU describe it since I have done literally everything else, and the ship belongs to your character?  I've noticed that people will cheerfully dump work on you and act like they're doing you a favor.\n\nSigh... I did it because I was desperate, and after a week of me carrying everything she said she was too busy to RP and quit.  I wonder if this is the reason people seem so unenthusiastic about RPs, maybe they've been burned too many times by people who ghost after 2 or 3 posts.\n\nIt's getting very hard for me to be enthusiastic about a new RP when I have to write the setting, come up with the plot, write the starter post because god knows they won't do it, and then HOPE they want to stick around so all my work wasn't for nothing.",

No real enthusiasm or drive to create stories beyond slice of life with superpowers. Which can be entertaining in short spurts here and there as filler between more interesting arcs. \n\nThere was a Mix of Canon's and OCs. Oddly the OCs were not over powered Mary Sues. They were more...utterly pathetic compared to any of the Canons. Not that the majority of the group (GM/ST included) actually had a clue what the rough power level in Marvel was to begin with. But that's a separate rant screaming into the void altogether. \n\nI can understand not detailing every nuance of the entire story, totally understandable, if you've done that there's no point in writing it out further. But a direction to go in is good. Something to be build towards and flesh out with smaller arcs is necessary. Something more than Wolverine and OC Jean Grey Ripoff now with less power and EE-Cups hooking up in the Garage for the tenth time this week. ",
