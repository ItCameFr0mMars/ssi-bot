You're not obliged to lead her until she blossoms, if you really think she's got *that* long a way to go; even though she's putting the beat on dyslexia and language barriers (whereas I can't even beat basic life skills).\n\nI don't really see what alternative solution you have other than waiting. What do you want here?\n\nI've always kind of had the idea that in a large and random group, 1/8-1/7 participants will be trouble in an actual emotional sense, as in starting bust-ups and the like. About a third beyond that will be good people but admittedly can be as detrimental to the RP's lifespan by being unreliable or slow posters, or sometimes having really personally-draining, or excessively-grandiose characters, etc...\n\nAnyways, Fiona seems like she's in neither category. Accordingly, although I'm quite sure you wouldn't have suggested it to begin with, I really don't think your group-mates are going to want to kick her out.\n\nSuccessful RP and collaborative writing is at least as much about social skills and empathy as it is about objective quality of written technique (if you can say for sure there is such a thing) - just saying.",

These are common everyday words. I don't see how they make writing \"low-literate fanfiction writing.\" Honestly, it makes me suspect that you're one of those thesaurus abusing purple prose writers that I, personally, find super annoying and exhausting to play with. I wouldn't ask that type of writer to change, though, because to each their own, and my fun isn't your/their fun.\n\nMinimize playing with her if you don't enjoy it. If her style changes to make playing with her more fun for you, great, you can start playing with her more again. If it doesn't, you dodged a bullet. Don't ask her to change unless she comes to you first.",

But it's nothing which can be avoided by a bit of practice.\n\nAnd besides, writing style is often a matter of taste. Tolkien can awesomely describe things like a boring stone - over pages (So I've heard). Some readers love it, others, like me, would fall asleep over time because I'm more interested in the plot than a very detailed description of some room we'll likely never see again after one or two pages.\n\nAlso, good luck keeping common words like \"to be\" and \"was\" varied without looking like a thesaurus-humper. People *will* notice.\n\nAn excerpt from your own writing would also be very nice to have. ;)",
