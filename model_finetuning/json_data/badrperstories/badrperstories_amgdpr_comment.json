He had published authors come in and critique us but it was never, LOL UR WRITING SUXXXX GET DUKED SON, it was always nice and helpful criticism and them telling us how to improve our style. You're not going to learn anything if you just decide that you're terrified of people telling you what they like and what they don't like about your writing. Without putting yourself out there for constructive criticism, how are you ever going to know what you're doing \"wrong\" or where to improve? ",

I can totally relate, and it's so frustrating.\n\nIt could be nothing to do with your writing and just bad luck. It's especially bothering because most RPers I've met are very non-confrontational, and if they're not feeling the plot as much as they thought they would, or if something is going on in their life that's stopping them from replying, they don't want to say anything because they don't want to disappoint you!\n\nIf you want to send me a writing sample I'd be happy to take a look at it, if only to help bolster your confidence, hahah.
