You seem very empathetic so I'm sure I don't need to tell you not to be too forthright about it - it could've been a net glitch of some kind as the other person said, or they might've been too distracted (by irl etc.) to really process and respond to the twist. It's also somewhat likely that they might be massively uncomfortable and/or unsure what to do with the ramifications of the knowledge drop for whatever reason, but it'd make more sense for them to tell that to you in that case - possibly not if they worried they'd seem rude or kill your rhythm, which admittedly I've done in the past.",

If they did do it on purpose you can let them know the information was important towards developing the plot and you are unsure of how to proceed, honesty is always the best policy.
