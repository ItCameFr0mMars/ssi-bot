Also the thought of Aizen hooking up with *anyone* is super weird.\n\nTo get to the basis of your post though, I\u2019ve never seen that, people faking deaths, but had similar stuff with people leaving and then coming back pretending to be someone else. Faking a death is so dramatic on their part.",

There was a girl and \u201cguy\u201d. The \u201cguy\u201d always kinda acted like some Chad douche in ooc chat and we were always sort of like... wtf are you doing in our nerdy ass rp. \u201cGuy\u201d also definitely hit on this girl in ooc chat more than once.\n\nGirl and \u201cguy\u201d have a lot of threads together. Like a lot. \u201cGuy\u201d also played a douche Chad IC, who plotted with this girl a lot to torment her female main.\n\nEventually the site changed hosts. On new host, you can see IPs, so staff quickly realize the two are the same... especially when the \u201ctwo\u201d of them thread with each other so much. They claimed they lived together, despite the fact that they never mentioned this and have always interacted as strangers in ooc chat. Plus, now that we looked at it, their writing styles were veerrry similar and profile pictures from the same source. They would have chunks of rp where these characters would fight but just one of them would post for the two, with a note that they\u2019re \u201cgodmodding with permission\u201d since they \u201cworked the details out on a private messenger for simplicity\u201d. I think she admitted to it in the end.\n\nSo yeah. It was definitely one person. Just... role playing with themselves all the time for some reason.",
