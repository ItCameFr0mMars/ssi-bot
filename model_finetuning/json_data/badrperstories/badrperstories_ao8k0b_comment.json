I don't think it's very helpful or interesting to write about topics like abuse in a one-dimensional sense of 'oh my God this is so bad!!!', if anything that's just written splatter as well, but it's equally if not even more important that it's not presented in a way that glorifies it and/or suggests that it's a normal thing.\n\nThis takes quite a lot of finesse and can be quite emotionally-draining as well which is why I'm careful and explore those topics sparingly to begin with. \n\nSecondly, when you are going to explore it, it really shouldn't be shoved in everyone's faces. It's not about fReE spEEcH, it's just a common courtesy especially as you don't know what other people writing alongside you might've had to go through in their lives. It's painful to see writing adjacent to a nasty personal experience of yours, slapped-up there indiscriminately by some halfwit who has no real idea about it and hasn't bothered to learn.\n\nYou could argue in their favour that if it's a thread-based forum and they have their own threads, at least people will know over time to steer well fucking clear of their torture porn party. But it definitely sounds like they're stomping all over the first issue. If the mods won't intervene although most of the players are strongly against it (if they are), I'd suggest like Dharian said to basically blank them IC and quite likely OOC as well and advise your mates to do the same at least in a non-committal kind of sense.
