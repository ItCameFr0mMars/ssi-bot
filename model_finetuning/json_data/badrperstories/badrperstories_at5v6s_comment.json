We romanticize drug dealers, underworld kingpins and serial killers like Walter White, Vito Corleone and Dexter Morgan because there is something inherently attractive about them. These characters exemplify the Jungian Shadow and help us to be able to analyze our own shadows, and thus ourselves, through how we feel about these vile people. Why do we relate for them so much? Why do we root for them? Can we still say we're good people if we do? What is the nature of morality? Is there some fundamental good or evil or is everything just relative?\n\nFurther, Jungian psychology states that one of the primary benefits to the appreciation, reconciliation and merger with the shadow is the lessening of anxiety and low self esteem. And considering the RP community tend to attract people with anxiety and self esteem issues like moths to a flame, I would argue this type of introspection is probably more beneficial to your average RPer than it is to the public at large.",

Would some people happen to be thrilled by that? Sure. But some people aren't, and for perfectly good reasons.\n\n\nSometimes we can forget that roleplaying is a collaborative hobby. That means other people have to have fun too for a likelihood to keep engaging with us. That requires some forethought as to what the other players seem to enjoy.\n\n\nMystery is one of those genres that should be saved for people you already have some sense of - otherwise, it can quickly turn into Unpleasant Surprise. She took a risk. It bombed. As long as she can take responsibility for that, this mistake can be a step forward in everyone making more informed decisions.\n\n\nAs for how dark I let it go - I've found myself getting more and more selective as to who I'll go sewer spelunking with. I've had fantastic, [consensually] torturous plots with respectful friends I've known long enough to peacefully disagree with on something. Knowing someone isn't going to pitch a fit or try to manipulate me into situations I'm not interested in indulging is mandatory.\n\n\nRe: the impending 'snowflake' tantrum - rejection sucks, but the loss of that kind of person's approval is ultimately a net gain sanity-wise.
