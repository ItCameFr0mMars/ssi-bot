But when they're not feeling a certain thing, I just go on Reddit and look. Though, most people seem to be looking for either erotica or comfort-writing, which are not things I particularly enjoy, so I just don't message them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and superhero roleplays. Generally, my taste just doesn't align with the majority and I find it hard to find someone who's worthwhile. ",
