Yes, see the issue there?\n\nThen she wanted to have one of her characters start this rebel movement that's basically the same what the Outsiders are already doing. We tell her that it doesn't really make sense and her char could just join Outsiders. Noo, she wants her character to start up this completely obsolete rebel movement because she still thinks it's a cool idea. \n\nEveryone is really wary of RPing with her because she keeps coming up with these ridiculous plots that just don't work. She's dyslexic and I think she has tried several RP groups before because I can swear I have seen someone complaining about person like this before. ",

I've done it a few times before and it's never fun. Perhaps use a voice chat to make it more personal?\n\nIf it were me, I'd do nothing to see what would happen for science.
