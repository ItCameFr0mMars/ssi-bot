This person's writing makes you stop and re-read it a bunch of times even when you know what all the words mean.\n\nI think a part of the problem it's that we've grossly mis-used the word \"literate\" to try defining a writing style, but since literacy has nothing to do with writing everyone has his or her own internal definition of what \"literate\" actually means.

The worst part was that she kept bragging about how she wanted to do writing for a living and her boss hired her to write articles for the company where she worked and that meant she was so much better at writing than everyone else because \"GUYS I DO WRITING FOR A LIVING NOW!!\" I wasn't the only person who hated her writing.
