Like, have to get a character sheet approved, can't godmod or the rest of the players will commit social darwinism on your ass. Like Starbound and such.  \nI've been on Minecraft creative servers just for the fun of messing about, and one of the things a lot of them do for RP is to have a board of pre-made characters. One of the most hilarious things I found was to go through each character's \"personality\" and read them aloud. It was a list of traits, and because the owner of the RP wanted people to play those characters, they'd just make every character perfect. \"Hot\" was apparently a personality trait, the list would basically go: \"Hot, sexy, smart, kind, shy, cute, brave.\" They'd have \"Everyone!\" listed for their friends. They've have \"secrets\" listed which get revealed immediately as soon as they enter the RP. Basically the RPs followed the theme of a lot of \"games\" for creative servers, they had shit like \"Hot or not\", \"Skin competition\", and literally \"speed-dating.\"   \nIt's like walking around a goddamned zoo. It's utterly hilarious.  \n[Here's an example of some \"character sheets.\"](https://imgur.com/qKpVlHr)",

            "body": "I don't know, sweetheart. RP servers (public or otherwise) haven't been one of my preferred form for years, and not without reason.\n\nBut here you mostly point out all of the things which naturally will come with the form and conclude it's bad based on that - apart from the 'bad roleplayers' which is a *massive* [citation needed]; it's honestly rather arrogant to call an entire form's worth of RPers 'bad', especially on the basis that they're - *gasp* - 'only wanting to do it for their own enjoyment'. What a novel concept, RPing primarily to have fun!\n\nYeah, it does primarily appeal to younger people. That's not a bad thing, it just means it doesn't much suit you or me. Yeah, it does only really let you quickly trade a few lines back-and-forth. That's... in some cases honestly quite refreshing, one of the *advantages* of server or chatroom RPs with these very brief quick replies is that you can have a natural IC conversation between two characters quite easily, as opposed to full posts where even for quite a veteran RPer there's always the temptation to accidentally start trading monologues with your partner.\n\nIn short, these honestly seem more reasons why they're bad *for you* than why they're bad objectively. I'm of the opinion that if the participants all had fun and no-one pulled some creepy shit, that's a successful RP period - even if the RP did happen to be about the machinations of Herobrine lying undetected for years, or something.",
