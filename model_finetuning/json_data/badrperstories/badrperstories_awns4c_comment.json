I used to be fairly active as an rper among a bunch of people who rped nation relations, occasionally with a focus on major characters/world leaders in our countries. Because we were mainly a collective body under a joint treaty, and I (my ambassador) had been elected in charge of the organization, I was actively trying to get suggestions  and ideas of making some progressive changes in OOC so I could apply these IC.  Some people wanted more emergency crisis threads and I did this as well as a sort of Avengers-esque pilot storyline cause there was an interest in these. Well, eventually after two or three crisis situations, I found myself losing interest as no one wanted to bite on to Amy storylines.  The importance seemed to be more in them discussing the size of their imaginary armies (many seemed a little out of proportion for their countries) and me having to constantly reel in members or have discussions with similar organizations to prevent some members from going to full-scale war with others. A lot of the ways they wanted to do this was through poorly written combat plots.... Felt like I was the only one trying to promote group cohesion by creating events and threads that would force some team work. Unfortunately my tenure as leader ended a few months later and with me being in grad school at the time, I was getting busy and no longer had time to be on there 24 hours a day.",
