If it is not fun, you should stop doing it with the person it is not fun with, whether the cause of that is IC or OOC.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere's no reason to be rude or mean when cutting contact, but it's not bad or wrong to detach.  If you feel they're going to guilt trip you or make a scene, at that point you give them one response and then you block them.  If they're more mature than that and ask why, you can honestly say \"I feel like we just don't click.\"  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI will be very up front that I've ended RPs with some very good writers that I clashed with OOC.  Most of the time it was for IC reasons, or because my IRL situation suddenly took a downturn and I couldn't maintain it any more, but there have definitely been cases where I just could not talk to someone any more and therefore could not write with them either.",
