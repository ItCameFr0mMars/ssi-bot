Do you have examples of your other characters that don't seem as popular? Then again, I can honestly say I've never been exposed to any of the rp tropes that have come up in this thread in all 8 years on the circuit.\n\nThing with roleplaying is, you could have someone with a character thats well written and the player writes well, but their face claim is an ugly old man, or just an unattractive person in general. These characters won't be as popular as the next one who is less well written but has a popular handsome/beautiful face claim. I guess i'm going off topic but it's true, if you've got a gorgeous face claim (that is especially male) you'll barely have to lift a finger far as getting plots goes.  ",

You realize that the target market for most PC games is people in the 18-36 crowd, right?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 and I play video games, mostly RPGs and simulations but indie games too.  I don't really read comics but I read fantasy and sci-fi novels, and watch lots of fantasy/sci-fi movies and shows as well as play tabletop and board games.  I also am a married, home-owning mother with a stable job doing manual labor.  Most women \\*that I know\\* my age are either in college, working low-wage hourly jobs living paycheck to paycheck, or are married with kids and are stay at home moms.  MANY of the women my age love playing video games and board games, one loves comics, and most love watching nerdy shit like me.   Many also don't.  I'm not friends with women like that but I know they exist, I've talked to plenty on FB mom groups and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think maybe \\*you\\* don't know how women in their mid-20s act, or alternately you assume that there's a general consensus on how we all act and what we all like.  Nope.",
