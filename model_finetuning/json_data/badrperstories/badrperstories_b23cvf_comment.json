Now, it might be because of the lack of detail, but...\n\nSo, it reads here like the writer for the criminal didn't mind having their character kidnap more than one person in this plot. Is that correct? Because if it is, the writer for said criminal probably *also* has ideas for the plot that they want to see written out. So did the other writers that joined the story. This is pretty much the nature of open RP\u2014everyone gets to contribute their ideas and characters to a story line. In my experience, this kind of spontaneity and change is innate to this hobby; that's why it's often a mistake to get too attached to preconceived notions of how the story \"should go\", because the influence of other writers and their characters may mean you won't see it play out like you expected or wanted.\n\nBut if you really wanted to control how this went, I guess my main question is this; if you wanted this scene to play out in a particular way, with a particular tone, why didn't you ask to make this scenario exclusive to your character, the criminal character, and the love interest character? Without that, I don't think it's fair to imply these guys are bad roleplayers just for joining in on an idea that wasn't originally yours and taking things in a direction that the other writers seem to like.",

Roleplaying is generally a group activity, and when it comes to making plotlines, the person who makes the plot sets the plotline and then everyone else has their characters react to the events. Trying to stick to a specific script does not make for good RP, if a specific script is what you want, then you should write a novel, not participate in a game with multiple players!",

If the person came up with it, then the plot isn't yours, you just had an idea on what **could** happen to your own character. Furthermore, if the person handling the whole thing was OK with adding more people to it, then you really have no reason to complain, as you are only a participant, not the head of it.\n\nIt sounds more like you wanted it to be solely about your character than the other player actually doing anything wrong.",

There isn't enough information to go off of, so I have no idea how the fellow who's joined is \"edgy\" or \"annoying,\" and without such information on what makes them so or what makes them a bad roleplayer, I can't make a call on what I think of them personally. All I can say is that it sounds like someone found the plot interesting and spoke to the person whom actually created the plot and has the final say for whether or not people join and can plot with them, and said person found their idea enjoyable or good enough to incorporate; which is absolutely fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one thing I can certainly say without a doubt, is that this post as it is without context feels more like someone cavilling rather than talking or ranting about bad roleplayers or bad RP behavior.",
