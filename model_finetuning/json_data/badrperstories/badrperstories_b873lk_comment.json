Tell her that you\u2019re not use to this stuff and that you\u2019re actually becoming anxious and uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nThe whole purpose of telling the admins first is so that they will be prepared to what may come next.

If she's younger as well and simply in a very willful, edgy, hormonal teen phase, it can explain some of it.  However, if you feel she's doing this very purposefully and knowing you are not consenting to it, that's on her.  You can explain things calmly to her (get screenshots and explain to Admins prior, totally, to cover yourself from backlash and hearsay), but ultimately, use your judgement.  If the group and higher ups aren't going to address it or have at least issue warnings, then it's not worth your time to stick with them.  Alternatively, you can feel around, ask other members who have roleplayed with her that you trust well enough if she did anything untoward as well to help back up your claims and to strengthen the resolve behind her either being given a strike or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf she really respects you as a writer and friend when you confront her, she'll apologize and try to grow from it, even if it's super awkward.  She'll re-evaluate her posts and plots with you.  If she goes into an online screaming match or starts to be malicious and no one is helpful, just go and find a better group.  I'm sorry this is starting to put you off the hobby, but I promise that it's very rewarding if you find a partner that respects your boundaries and meshes well with your personality.  Best of luck.",
