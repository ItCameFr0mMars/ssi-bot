For example, they have no business enforcing copyright on behalf of the creator of Ed Edd and Eddy. That is not even slightly legal. But it's really just an issue of why would you want to associate with people who do this sort of thing? People like that are not good people to have in your life, imho.

It's known that they cannot handle criticism, vastly value art over writing, and will freak out over tiny, accidental things. There's a reason multiple members quit by the end of their soft opening. They are not rational people and most folks will listen if you explain what happened.\n\nI also got banned from the same site for telling a friend, over DM, in confidence, that I wasn't sure I was entirely comfortable with the fact that they allow humans and dragons (and humans and whers) to enter sexual (and romantic, of course) relationships. (This was _nowhere_ in the site's information. Admin confirmed over discord.) Apparently it counts as slander and endangers the site. See, people can't know about the dragonfucking until _after_ they've joined.\n\nWell, _technically_ that's not true. I was suspended for... I think it was two weeks to a month? For that. (It was my second 'strike'. I got my first for 'talking over people' in the chat and questioning the lore and mechanics too much. During the soft open. Which I was supposed to be a beta for. And I asked, multiple times, if they were alright with all my questions and suggestions.) I was completely honest with them about what had happened and even provided screenshots of my full conversation. Apparently it didn't help my case and made things worse. No, my comment to a friend got my suspended. (This is after I pushed to make them tell me what my punishment was going to be. Initially, they basically told me to wait in limbo for an undetermined amount of time while they focus on the site's grand opening.) I was _banned_ for spelling out to them in amazingly technical, long-winded, analytical language that was _absolutely_ meant to make them feel like morons _exactly_ why that was bullshit, ending in me saying not to bother, because I would not be returning. At which point I got a message back saying that I was banned for X, X, and X crimes, to which I pointed out that it was kind of a empty power move at that point.\n\nBut, since I got banned for it anyway... Did you know that your character can fuck their own dragon on that site? Because they can! Whers, too! There was a long discussing in which they made clear that their dragonkin have hemi-peens specifically for this purpose! Don't let yourself stress too much over dragonfucker Weyr.
