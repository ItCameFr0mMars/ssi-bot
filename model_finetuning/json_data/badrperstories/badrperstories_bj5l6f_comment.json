I think a big part of it is so many of the people who really built it up are gone since the game is basically on life support.  It's why usually in MMO's i join a group and focus pretty heavily on them to avoid the outside drama.  \n\nAnd yeah, i guess there are worse in the community, I just have never engaged with them or really paid attention.  They recently did a thing were a bunch of them released testimonies to publicly shame some toxic folks.  But of course it was the other toxic folks doing the shaming dragging everyone else in.  \n\nIt was basically rp Revenge porn at this time with people not satisfied with how things ended between them and someone else airing out the worst most damaging things they can think of and telling everyone who complains about it that they aren't the ones who are bad, look at them, they are worse.  I've moved onto FF XIV at this point with some people from this group who I really like and we're building something fun there.",

            "body": "I have a theory on this.  I think it's because there are like very few clearly defined lore rules, so everyone just creates their own lore to suit their character.  Lore rules are the guidelines that let everyone interact from the same place, so when everyone is just making up their own it's a mess.  Add to that your characters are functionally immortal and super powered and you have a game that appeals to people who find other games too restrictive.  These people usually like feeling special and creating hybrid races and combinations because why not, the rules don't say you can't.  Throw in a bunch of other people who are all special in their own way, each thinking they are the best and should be winning at whatever they do, and you get a really really messy community.  \n\nIt wasn't always like this, like all games it had it's goldshires and quicksands.  But they had some extremely smart people who leaned into the horror setting and made challenges that couldn't always be beaten, and stories where failure seemed inevitable.  Now it's just an action rpg where people are basically playing superman/woman just without the kryptonite.",

For instance just the basics on how things work, things that specifically don't, and how to have fun within them.  In this games case there are almost no boundaries, and for most people this isn't a problem.  Some though look at it and go \"because it doesn't say this can't be done I'm going to do it\" and create something like the vampire/something hybrids, or demon/something hybrids.  And take the strengths of whatever they are combining with like no weaknesses.  This leads to ever increasing one upmanship with people trying to create ever more special characters to stand at the pinnacle of specialness.  And if you try to say something they try to do doesn't work it just means they make themselves more powerful so it doesn't happen again.\n\nA shared sense of lore just means everyone is coming from the same place and is on the same level, these things can still happen, they are just waaaay less likely too when everyone talks about and agrees to how things do or do not work in any game.  You can make up rules if you want, just be sure everyone you play with agrees to them.  If they don't, be prepared to be very very isolated.",
