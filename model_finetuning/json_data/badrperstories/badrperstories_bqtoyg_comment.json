Software is software, and someone's always working out a way to get around it. Saying \"no it's the most magical software ever and no one can ever do anything about it so shut up\" wouldn't be a satisfying answer to me, either. Something like \"Maybe, but you don't currently know of anyone who could design countermeasures like that, especially because no one outside [faction] even has any information on the software or hardware\" is much more satisfying. You're giving an answer that makes much more sense in-universe than \"magical unalterable software\" while still not committing yourself to letting the player DO anything about it. You could even pair them. \"Theoretically, in universe, it's possible but you'd need X Y and Z that you don't have. OOC, though, you're not going to find those things.\"",
