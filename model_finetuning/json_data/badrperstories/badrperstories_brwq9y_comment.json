It\u2019s entirely possible you got a couple bad eggs, this subreddit is proof enough that there\u2019s plenty of them out there.\n\nBut I would say that if your partners feel the need to let you know when they need space in the first place, this might be a red flag. There is only one member of our forum I ever feel the need to remind that I can\u2019t necessarily get to our threads immediately. Everyone else seems to understand that I will get to things when I have time, so I have no need to even mention it. This one member tends to be pushy, even if I don\u2019t think she realizes she\u2019s doing it. She will make roundabout references to her posts in group chat. Ask if I\u2019ve seen the tag, sometimes more than once, especially if she sees me respond to anything else. Talk about how excited she is for that thread/plot. Say \u2018hi\u2019 to me whenever I get online- but only ever when she\u2019s waiting for me to write something for her.\n\nThese things may seem innocuous to you, as I know they do to her, but they can be exhausting to deal with. In some cases, it makes me want to write that tag even less, because when I sit down to write it, I can\u2019t help but associate it with all the grief I\u2019ve gotten about it. And it says my creative energy for it and it takes even longer to get to. People may be holding off on replies if you are making it not fun to rp with you, in favor of people they are having fun rping with.\n\nIf you\u2019re legitimately interested in figuring out whether you are manipulative, take a critical look at any actions that may have caused it, even if it wasn\u2019t your intent to do so.",
