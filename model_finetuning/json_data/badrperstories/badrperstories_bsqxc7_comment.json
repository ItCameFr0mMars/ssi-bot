I tried to make it keep working with some of my first partners for a solid two years after it stopped being fun (they wanted slice of life, I wanted action and stakes), but in the end I had to let it go.  Another partner I parted company from more recently after writing together for around two years.  He was a very intense, sometimes very angry person and as my medical situation worsened I just couldn't handle the ooc even though he was a great writer with engaging, lifelike characters.",
