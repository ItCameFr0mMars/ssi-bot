In the meantime, we were told to play house and RP fishing. RP fishing and playing house... in a post-apoc grimdark universe? Absolutely nothing happened after that.\n\nGot banned after trying to continue the RP (those events had shaped the entire server) and got banno'd.",

I have a partner that I've known for years but I'm always hesitant to RP with her because she never finishes anything and all of our rps always die after two or four posts. I found that moving away from her and keeping her as just an OOC friend has made my rp experience a lot better. It hurts clinging onto something that isn't going to happen and constantly hoping for promises that will never be fulfilled. My advice is to move on, find a site that deserves your devotion.",
