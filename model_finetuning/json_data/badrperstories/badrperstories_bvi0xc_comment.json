            "body": "I tend to avoid a lot of group roleplays because of scenarios like this. \n\nI joined a fandom roleplay before, and all the main canon characters were taking. I was very new, and so I ended up having to take a side character.  Even though I was able to come up with more lore and have the character involve with others, everyone ended up ignoring that character in which I was pretty much assigned too. What made me a little disappointed was that the admins allowed a few of their favorites to take on more of the main canon characters. I ended up leaving.\n\nThe other was that because I joined a group and didn\u2019t know anyone, I was told that I could only make a villain oc for the roleplay (which I didn\u2019t mind). Except they excluded me out of a lot of general discussion and arc planning. So for every \u201carc\u201d that was done, they just kept making me the villain. I ended up asking the admins if someone else could play the villain role and they started saying to say I was still too new and might make mistakes. It didn\u2019t make sense to me because I roleplayed three months with them and some of the members wanted me to play a hero type. One of the admins ended up calling me a nuisance, and the other slipped out that it\u2019s also why I was never allowed to partake in their general OOC chats. Which I didn\u2019t know about me. So it was like me roleplaying the villain, made them isolate me OOC. I just called it quits and left after finishing the last arc.",

I was young back then, obviously had no idea about proper RPing and was too shy to ask others directly (I think I have asked once, but was told that they couldn't). And everytime I tried to interact with them, they either ignored me or treated me like something in passing.\n\nEnded up introducing \"Adventures\", basically world-altering plots with an endgoal the players can work towards. Received flak for this by the admin, but could be placated by the info that nobody was forced to participate. \n\nBasically I only did it to find someone to play with, but in the end, it worked and brought us closer together. Otherwise I could just write fanfics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, founding a clique and not paying attention to newbies and everyone else not part of your circle isn't necessarily bad roleplaying. But it's poison for an RP's lifespan.",
