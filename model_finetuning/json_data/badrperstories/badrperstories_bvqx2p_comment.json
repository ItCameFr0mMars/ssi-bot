            "body": "I have an incredible amount of bookmarks, and an insanely bad memory. I do try and remember, but it just doesn't work. It's not a one-hit wonder type of situation, as I do genuinely try and keep interest as much as I can. Most of these aren't on forums dedicated to just one thing and that thing only. When someone tries to RP 1-on-1 with me it usually goes something like:\n\nOther Player: Hey do you wanna RP something?\nMe: Sure, what did you have in mind?\nOther Player: How about [insert idea here]?\nMe: Well, I'll certainly try! My responses might take just about forever though because of how my brain does writing and my bad memory though.\n\nAnd then something happens after a post or two, and I get wrapped up by something else and by the time I remember the thing exists it's too late and now the other person probably hates me because I suck hardcore at RP. This is why I tend to mainly go on \"Bad\" RP sources to RP (Roblox, chat sites, ect.) because it's short-term enough that my brain doesn't fart out on me and I don't have to worry about \"Am I a bad person for not having the muse for this rn?\" or \"Crap, is it too late to pick up this thread again?\" or any of the like. If I didn't sign up to places because \"Oh no what if my muse dies or I forget\" I'd never get to play anything ever.\n\nLike, I legitimately think there is something wrong with my brain with how easily I forget about things. No professionals I try and see about it take it seriously, and I don't trust myself to try and solve it on my own, so I'm stuck. I know it's \"no excuse\" and that I probably just suck at RP or whatever, but it exists. I know I should probably quit roleplaying because of all this combined with me always having to do things IRL at exactly the wrong time, but this is one of the only creative releases I have. I'm not trying to guilt you or anything, just explaining why in this specific case, it is indeed a valid explanation because it's just that bad.",
