A purple prose thesaurus wank fest isn't going to impress me these days but it did when I was much younger. \n\nI'm apart of a forum where all the RPer's either produce a substantial well put together post, or they produce beautiful posts that show constraint with a sprinkle of purple here and there. THAT'S beautiful. On that same forum, a new member posted a profile which was literally impossible to understand because it was a big wall of overly flowery purple prose and I doubt anyone could really grasp what that character was even about. I avoid writing with anyone like that just as I'd avoid people that offer up a small paragraph of nothing. \n\nOn that note, I read and like authors who might have an unconventional style and who often utilize purple prose. Cormac McCarthy, Clive Barker, Megan Abbott, John Williams... As examples off the top of my head. So It's not my lack of reading comprehension. These people are professionals though, not some hobbyist trying to flex.  \n\nI actually think striking the ideal level isn't even that difficult far as RP goes.",

She wrote multiple paragraphs that often borderlined purple prose territory. Our threads never lasted too long because I wasn't a major player in her storyline, and she had main partners, along with the fact that I simply struggled to maintain a similar response length. It became apparent that I couldn't hang. While I was grateful that she wrote with me, I ended up having to throw the towel. I told her that her writing was like I said earlier, intense, and she took offense to that. I didn't know how else to describe it and I honestly felt that I wasn't a proper fit for her character or her world, but I did appreciate being able to write with her when I could. And like I said, we're still friends to this day, so I'm glad our creative writing differences didn't ruin our friendship. Still, so much prose can derail a fellow writer, not to mention make the eyes strain in the process.",
