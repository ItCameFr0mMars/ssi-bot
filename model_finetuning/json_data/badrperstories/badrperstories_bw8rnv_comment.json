Though it was a tad in reverse, they were able to attend but the other five players weren't. 5/7 missing, was Flu season and everybody, including my roommate the Pilot for their Starship, was down sick. Gave them like a 2 day warning that game wasn't going to be happening since the majority of the table was down sick and I was starting to feel a bit like crap as well. They were a bit disappointed and upset, which I get. Was going to offer to let them come by and we could do some sort of side thing during a time skip that recently occurred when they gave me an ultimatum that they were going to leave the group if anything like this ever happened again. Promptly told them to not show up again and to fuck off. I don't respond well to ultimatums or demands, especially from people I'm spending money on entertaining.",
