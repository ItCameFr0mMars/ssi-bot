And you are correct in that it is hard to find more.  That doesn't mean you should settle for someone that is hard to work with and ignores the actual contents of your posts.  At the point where they're making everything revolve around them and godmoding everyone's reactions, it may be time to consider politely ending it with a statement to the effect that you feel you are no longer compatible or something like that.  It is not your job to fix them unless they ask to be fixed.",

            "body": "I am lucky that I live in Germany, and German RPs seem to be often more detailed in general.I have also encountered people like the person you mentioned in the second half of your post, and it is extremely frustrating to deal with them. My advice is: these types of RPs are almost never worth keeping. It is unlikely that it will get better, because it is obvious that this person does not really care about the story/the characters you invented, but only about their own character. The main problem does not seem to be that their character is boring, he/she could probably be the most interesting character ever and the rp would still be no fun. If you want to address the issues you have, I would say something along the lines of:\n\n\\-it often seems as if you are not interested in the life of my characters/the world in general, and you tend to focus a lot on your own character. This makes the rp not very enjoyable for me, because I care much more about the interactions between our characters.  If I wanted to read something that focused only on one character and their life story without any chance of influencing the story, I could read a book or a fanfiction instead.\n\n\\-please do not control background characters/main characters that I have created and predict how their reaction to the actions of your character might be. I am the creator of these characters, and only I know them well enough to tell you how they would react.\n\n\\-please keep in mind that nobody is perfect, and every character has their flaws. A character who solves every problem is unrealistic, and maybe you should keep in mind why other characters in the story are important as well to make the world more interesting.\n\nmaybe not all of these points apply to your problem. But I hope some of them will help you get your point across. You do not have to tell them that their character is boring, but maybe underline that you care more about the interactions between the characters and it is hard to enjoy them if they are often controlled by your writing-partner.",
