I don't really see how these samples break \"every single writing rule there is.\" That's a very bold claim; could you enlighten me as to how it's true? \n\nAs for the style itself... Well, as I said, there are certainly a fair amount of grammar, punctuation, and word choice errors, but I've seen better and worse. Overall, they seem like they're going for a \"gritty,\" or perhaps \"earthy\" would be a better tone. A commendable enough goal, but doing so by adding a liberal sprinkling of profanity to every post is something that would make me, personally, lose interest in interaction fairly quickly.\n\nAs for part of it not being things your character can use... I wasn't aware that was the point of RP. There should certainly be *something* there to respond to, and if your excerpts were each an entire post, then I can see why you might be frustrated. The way you're addressing the subject, though, makes it seem as if you think any content in an RP post that your character can't react to is useless, and on that point I heartily disagree.\n\nNow, I won't deny that you clearly have incompatible styles; or at least, that *you* find their style unappealing. That's okay, because it's your opinion, and opinions are okay things. I suspect the reason that the reaction has been such to make you insert that defensive edit into your post, however, is that you seem to be consistently claiming that elements of their style are *inherently* bad, and that that is the aspect of your stance many responses are disagreeing with.",

            "body": "I can certainly give my opinion on it.\n\nThe biggest issue I see with the samples given above is grammar and the way they parse. For example, the author wrote \"He was never been good at that, holding his tongue.\" That illustrates both issues nicely. \"Was\" is incorrect grammar, and the author should have used \"had\" instead. As to the second point, the transition between \"that\" and \"holding\" should have used a semicolon rather than a comma. There are a lot of issues in that vein with the posted samples, and I can break it all down via PM if you're *really* interested.\n\nA secondary issue, and this is *purely* a personal matter, is that I (a) don't care much for profanity in general terms and (b) think it loses impact in direct proportion to the frequency of its use, until it eventually ceases to mean *anything* - at which point it's just wasted words. In all fairness to the author, however, there are a lot of people who use profanity like I use analogies, and he's likely playing one of those characters.\n\nThe prose is slightly purple, and that's a little annoying; unnecessary descriptors and repetition of similar concepts \"dilute\" the message, in my opinion, while taking longer to read. \n\nNow, onto the thing that OP seems very vehemently opposed to, that I see as a non-issue. Internal monologue, perceptional description, and the like. I think this is actually a good thing, as long as it's coupled with sufficient external detail for an RP partner to respond to. Detailing a character's internal experience makes them much more compelling and \"real.\"\n\nOverall, I'd say grammar and punctuation are the biggest issues with the samples given, with purple prose being a less important matter that might still warrant addressing, and everything else boiling down to personal taste.
