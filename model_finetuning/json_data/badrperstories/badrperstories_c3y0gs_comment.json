Most do not have any idea what is this all about AT ALL. For people to make a choice in any situation or to even understand it , they need to know the details and all they seen so far were screaming fights into the abyss. Not only you but also people you argue with. Not that you should not stand your ground in conflict especially if you ended with horrid roleplay group that harassed you but all you describe is the aftermath. Since this reddit is dedicated to specific RP related suck, you could write:\n\n1) What was this game? What was the plot? Who played it and how your own plot went with theirs.\n\n2) Who were the players you clashed with and what did they or you done. Names you mention tell us nothing as never met these people. \n\n3) How did it progress? How did it end? How did other players of said game react?\n\n4) Was the whole shebang due to a toxic group, bad administration, other players, you yourself? Was there nothing wrong with the game as you joined? If yes - what changed if no - what were the warning signs.\n\n\nIn summary - if you explain something not to your friends - write it as if it was an article that complete strangers will read. I am curious on that story as just heard your name and people arguing. That is it. I do not know why or who is in the right as do not know what happened at all. Nor reddit here will.",

Every time you have been confronted with this, you have turned around and claimed someone made you do these horrible things or you have blatantly lied and tried to claim you did nothing.  \n\nThere have been numerous posts by you, on several different media platforms, claiming that you have been a victim, when in fact, you have been the aggressor, the instigator, and the stalker.  People have actually tried to help you, by using logic and reasoning, warning you not to post private, RL information and you posted your driver's license up for everyone to see.  In turn, you then accused them of making you do that.\n\nYou are right about your sex life, that really is no one's business and I don't know why you felt you had to over share it with everyone, on a public gossip site, in their threads.  \n\nDuring all of this, you have blamed this person named Liyah, claiming she is the one making you do these things and act like this, despite the fact that she has not even been involved, other than you evoking her name.  Then you claimed it was the website and the people on it.\n\nSince you appear to not be able to help yourself and the fact that quite a few people have become genuinely concerned about your threats regarding hurting people and yourself, the website has now banned you, along with blocking you on their FB page as well.  Please get some help because what you have been doing, is just hurting yourself here.",
