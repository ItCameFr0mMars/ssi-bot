When I respond to rp searches on here I say it upfront, so if they can't respect that or just want to do smut then they can find someone else to rp with. Anyways, don't hesitate to tell people what your preferences/limits are. Forcing someone to do something their uncomfortable with is not okay, and you should not have to put up with that. Also not respecting that people have lives that don't revolve around roleplaying is not okay either. We all have jobs, family, friends, commitments and hobbies besides roleplaying. If you can't respond anymore because you need to go to bed so you can wake up early, are tired or busy with something else then whoever you're roleplaying with needs to understand that and needs to back off. \n\nThis person/people you are talking about is selfish and toxic, and I would recommend cutting them off for your own sake. I had a friend (not through rping, just a person I knew irl) who was toxic like this and she really messed with my mental health during college. I really thought she was my friend, but she was just taking advantage of my kindness. \n\nAnyways, roleplaying is supposed to be fun for all the people involved; best of luck to you in finding a good rp partner that will respect you and your preferences. :)",
