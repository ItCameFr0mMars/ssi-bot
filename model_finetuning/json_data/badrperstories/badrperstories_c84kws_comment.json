I have no reason to believe this writer is hostile based on your post, so I'd say hit them up and say something casual and polite, like, \"Hello!

Everyone else humored it and I'd just switch channels when she started up with it again. I loved this person besides that,  but it drove me crazy. She also used this character as a self-insert to bone as many canons from the fandom we were writing in as possible. Literally every time someone picked up a canon character, she would DM them about how they hooked up once. She was good friends with an admin who created a discord role for anyone who wrote a character that hers had slept with previously, and she regularly used it to mention us with sad shit that no one cared about",
