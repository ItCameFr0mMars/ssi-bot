Like, what upsets you more than them being a control freak, or racist, or homophobic, is that people liked/paid attention to their characters more than yours; at least, it seems that way, because you wrote a *lot* more about how people shouldn't have liked their characters because yours were so much better and their posts were so bad than you did about the racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Also, and again, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it kind of seems like you may have \"protagonist syndrome\" a bit here, judging by the part that you edited to say that your characters were supposed to be driving the plot. Speaking personally, even if you were the one who created the RP, I wouldn't want to join an RP knowing I was intended to be a minor character; in fact, the mindset of \"I'm the main/most important character\" has been the source of a number of posts on this and similar subreddits.",

That is not, however, how it was done in any freeform RP I was part of) but I can speak to the fact that it's generally considered bad form in tabletop RPGs for the GM to have a character that they place as much or more importance on than those of the other players. That's known as a GMPC, and tends to be frowned on, as it relegates the other players to side characters in the story. The GM's job, in my opinion, is to run the world for the players to adventure through, playing the characters they encounter and the challenges they overcome. It is *not* to be the main character, whether the RP is focused on a single plot or on exploration of an open world.",
