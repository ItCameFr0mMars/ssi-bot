I knew about it a while back, let one of the current Staff know, and got the ASCII /shrug Discord, was told there was 'nothing they could do, but talk to them', and 'we'll let them know to please be more careful in the future'. One Admin is the only one that does anything, the other ones are useless. I had an issue with the main-active admin, discussed it with one of the others as a friend, they promptly went and tattletaled to the admin I had the issue with - this is after telling everyone on-site that they 'handle these issues seriously' and 'have a confidentiality agreement to not name names'; after getting basically shit all over in Discord by the Admin I had the issue with, she told me 'we're all friends, we all talk'.   \n\n\nIt's a clusterfuck, tbh. One of the admins used to be a friend of mine until every single thing I do apparently warranted her opinion on things/flooding my Discord with complaints. Shortly after quitting I removed her from my Discord, took her off my Bnet for WoW, and only have to deal with her on another site she's on with me (which is surprisingly chill - I guess she figured out I'm sick of her shit and I won't hesitate to put her on NC if she keeps being abusive).   \n\n\nIt's a real hot mess, and it makes me sad because it used to be such a great site, once upon a time.",

Other ones stayed up well over 2-3 weeks before people asked them to be moved.   \n\n\nYou also can't see any of the OOC boards unless you join and become a member. Fucking laughable XDXDXD.   \n(Found this out when I couldn't find the copy of one of my character sheets, and went back to retrieve the info to adapt it for a much, much better site I'm now on...these people really are fucking shameless, as locking char sheets to non-membership viewers was something I'd been asking them to do for years, after I found one of my chars - complete with PB and plagerized down to the letter - on another board).",
