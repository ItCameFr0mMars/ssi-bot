It's been my experience that this can really revitalize everyone because unless you do a major plot with a vastly difference change of pace and style, staying in the same \"universe\" can sometimes get repetitive and predictable.  Making everyone take their pre-existing characters and say, making them temporarily forget their current alliances and grudges and forcing them to exist in another universe as other beings to encounter each other again under difference circumstances can really be interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, in the regular universe Fred and Erica are a couple, with their anti-hero comrade Jerry having a long-hidden crush on Erica that often causes tension.  He attests that if he had met her first or if she wasn't so loyal to Fred, they would be the Ultimate Power couple.  They get into this AU without prior memories, but parts of their base personality are retained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErica then meets Jerry first in this universe and there is instant chemistry.  Everything is going well, but Fred's avatar appears, but something has clearly flipped in him.  His rigid sense of rules has been perverted in this world and instead of his adherence of rules in a good way, it is now used in a mob situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally, it can help get everyone interested again because it allows them to use their same characters, but explore a different aspect of them temporarily.

It happens to the best of us and it's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWhen I find myself falling out of love with an RP or online group I'm part of and like I'm just going through the motions, I make it a point to step back for a week or two. I don't read it, don't log in, don't engage for that period and evaluate how I'm feeling through it. If I really miss the game and want to play during that time, I know it's not time to go, but if I feel relaxed and happier from not playing, it's time for me to move on. Don't beat yourself up. You've got years to build new worlds, make new characters. One dying isn't necessarily a sad occasion, because it's the chance to make something even better in the future, or come back refreshed and ready later.",
