Maybe not during the attempted murder sequence since that was a small-scale rp, but while they had their second character stealing medicinal supplies and the first rallying players together to attack my group they certainly were warned. The server also has a policy where if you do something then later realize it was an action you didn't want to take, you can either retcon the action (if possible) or alter what happened. \n\nThis person wanted to keep all of their actions yet didn't want any of the consequences that they were notified would come with them. To make matters worse, the consequences weren't really even that bad. Their first character still had their close friends, they only lost 1 or 2 acquaintances and had to just gain trust back from the people who didn't know them well. Second character was just forced to find replacement supplies. I've seen people on the server retcon huge things because they didn't want their character to be kicked out and no one would bat an eye. I think player just couldn't stand the idea that their characters couldn't make bad actions and then get away with it.",

It's one of the more grating things in RP for me where people create characters that have these distinct traits, like the speech impediment, which they usually use to garner some sort of sympathy and then ditch it whenever it's inconvenient.  In my situation I had someone who created their character to be wheelchair bound and tried to play themselves off as weak and needing people to be nice to her, but simultaneously pretended her wheelchair had the capability of transforming into a weaponized platform because she was a genius inventor.  She also had crippling depression so you needed to treat her super nice.  The few times someone did actually push consequences on her for things she did, and there were a lot of things she did, she would literally do these long drawn out things about how traumatized her character was by this and why would we do that to her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's rough dealing with people like them, they create these narratives in their head about how these things are going to go down and then get super upset that the other people don't do what they want and accuse them of bad roleplaying (mine once apologized about the misunderstanding before launching into an hour and a half long spiel about the many different ways i was a bad roleplayer lol).  You seem to have handled it pretty well though, and glad your moderators did step in for you.  Hopefully yours is resolved by now.",

At the time, I was using multiple characters, ranging from Ukraine, to an oc I called Galantis. This one person, who I will refer to as \"Red\", would constantly try to attack Ukraine, and sometimes would attack my other characters! They would do stuff that was simply impossible, like ignoring a kick to the balls, a direct fireball to the face, to sometimes even a powerful lunge, and counter it by auto hitting, and sometimes even auto killing my characters! The only time I was successful with getting away from having my character fatally wounded, or even killed, by this guy, was when he tried to use things that would generally not hurt my gal, Galantis (she was based off of a gas giant planet, and was, therefore, made of gas. So all solids, and most liquids, wouldn't harm her), like guns, punches to the face, etc. He did get punished for being aggressive many times, and now he is usually a bit less aggressive towards my ocs. But when he was kicked from one chat... Oh boy... He wasn't happy.\n\n\n\nI've had people be aggressive to my characters, especially this other person who would constantly make my character's life a living hell, but I knew he was either just joking around, or contributing to the plot, or even creating a plot, for the rp, and he generally was a great guy. But this was a new thing.",
