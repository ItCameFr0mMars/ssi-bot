Some of the comics do give him genuine emotions, although his main goal remains to slaughter everyone.\n\nMeanwhile a creature like the Alien is more animal, but probably one of the smartest things in horror. It will and shall react to whatever someone does and is an apex predator. They will have animalistic instincts, but theyre smart if not smarter than most humans.\n\nStraight up beasts (think Jaws) will function by primal instincts. Hunt for food, flee when in danger. Breed when possible. Its like controlling an animal really.\n\nIf you need help, dont feel bad to DM me. I'd me more than happy to.",

For example, if it doesn't age or need sustenance, then it may have no concept of urgency; it's perfectly willing to spend decades or centuries accomplishing its goals. A great example of this sort of thing is the Formics from the Ender's Game series. They're an intelligent species, but when they met humans, they had only the slightest concept of individuality, since a single queen might have millions of mind-linked drones under her command. When they showed up in human space, they killed a few colonists in the same way you might brush some hair off your seat; they had no idea that they were *people*, and since the entire species communicates exclusively via telepathy, they had no way of understanding the war that that kicked off until it was almost too late.",

Imagine the creature on a couple levels:  physically, culturally, emotionally, and mentally.\n\nPhysically:  How its body is will dictate how it lives, what its natural environment is like, what needs it must have met.  How long do they live?  What kind of bodies do they have?  From this you can determine if it more isolated or social which gives way to how it acts...\n\nCulturally:  If its species is sentient with higher thought, how do they interact with each other, and how would this form their culture and behaviors.  Judging by the way they interact with other beings, then...\n\nEmotionally and mentally:  Their means and ways of interacting are going to be \\[peaceful, hostile, with more collectivist or individualistic slant, centered around meeting what needs, etc\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you get this down, it should help you determine how you want to write things.  Examine how other writers and how other forms of media depict non-humans.  Sparrows in Brian Jacques novels speak in sharp, disjointed English as when he watched sparrows in his garden, their chirps and tweets were very pointed, very punchy, so he made their speech that way.  Robots and androids in lots of movies and books are calm, non-emotive, their speech eloquent, but concise, because they're made without emotions and likely follow very stringent rules of grammar.  The Na'vi in Avatar speak in very vague, nebulous ways, because of their metaphysical sort of existence where bodies are vessels and the spirit is eternal and their deity is in everything and everything is in it, so sometimes they way they speak is grammatically incorrect or vague, but that sense of logic takes backseat to the greater idea.

But leave its thoughts and thought process a mystery as much as possible. If you need to convey intention, keep the narration kind of vague and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)](othered.) (Wikipedia link, just in case someone doesn't know what othering is.)\n\nFor an example, I write a dragon. Not one of the magnificent glorious creatures we have now, but a more classical dragon, like Smaug. You know, a pathetic bully that's terrified of losing what power/money/respect it has managed to accumulate. My dragon is an inhuman intelligence. She's not smarter than a human, but she can seem like it because she's lived a long time, has a wide array of knowledge and experience and a near-infinite well of patience. I play this by describing what you see rather than what she is.\n\n\"You see a dragon. She's maybe cute in an ugly sort of way. Noticing you, her tail thumps against the ground, doglike. She seems happy to see you.\"\n\nAnd now, what you don't realize is that she's a conniving kingmaker. She's happy to see another sucker that she can build a power base around. She probably won't eat you. She probably won't eat anyone around you. Hell, you may die quite happily of old age, never realizing that you were a figurehead presiding over a fantasy North Korea.\n\nSo that's the secret, I think. Have your character's internal logic in mind. Always be able to justify why your character will behave in the way they will. But never let your partner know about it.",
