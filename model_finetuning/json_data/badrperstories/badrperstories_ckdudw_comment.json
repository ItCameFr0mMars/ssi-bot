            "body": "Honestly, the only advice I can think of for this is to try and reassure him that the type of roleplays he enjoys and the characters he likes playing aren't weird. I'm a girl and I tend to write submissively, for girl and guy characters. Plenty of people do, I even know a few guy rpers that write submissively! It's a pretty common thing. Try to reassure him that you don't mind roleplaying with that type of character and that he's allowed to want to roleplay as a submissive male! So much of the rp community is toxic, they expect people to play certain characters certain ways and they can be judgemental when it doesn't go their way. To me, it sounds like your friend has had a few too many run-ins with people like that. So as his friend all you can really do is reassure and encourage. Maybe mention how you like how his characters do certain things? Just try to be positive with them and hopefully it will allow him to feel more confident and really get to delve into and explore the kind of characters and rps he enjoys doing!\n\nI'm sorry this isn't the best advice, but I really do hope it helps a little. I think a lot of people can be insecure about their roleplaying and characters. In my own experience, it really helps to talk to your partners about all the things you love about how they rp. It can help someone feel more comfortable with it all.",

Or is he just a very feminine guy and shy about it? I cannot jump to assumptions here and neither should you, what you mentioned could have quite a few causes, but either way, there's a common thing between them: Him being closeted about his real interests.\n\nMaybe talk to him and tell him he doesn't need to be shy about it and you won't find him weird for wanting to play a feminine male or a female character?\n\nThis sounds like something that needs a lot more working on than just his roleplaying routine, however. You should be there for him and encourage him to be himself and to tell you how he really feels about himself, rather than bottle it up in that way. Roleplay is less important here. If he doesn't get over his insecurity, he won't improve, neither in roleplaying nor in any other aspect of his life that could be affected by the insecurity as well.",
