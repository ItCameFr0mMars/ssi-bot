I'd try to explain things to my writing partner and see if, bottom line, cards on the table, they could ever be happy with my two posts a day (which,!, that's a lot in my opinion, unless they're like one- or two-sentence posts). \n\nBy explain, I mean maybe let them in on your writing process. Maybe your mind needs to toss things around like mine does, or maybe you have to be in a certain frame of mind. Maybe you can't concentrate well if other things in your day aren't taken care of.\n\nI know that for me, if I try to force writing when I'm not ready, I'll wind up not being able to write_at all_.
