            "body": "&gt;I decided to end that toxic relationship for good\n\nYES! I LOVE to hear people make the decision to end relationsihps where they don't get out what they are putting in.\n\n&gt;I regret ever associating myself with roleplaying...it all ends the same...\n\nI have been roleplaying in a variety of ways (romantic, ERP and D&amp;D) for about 10 years. I can confirm it does not all end the same. I've had hundreds of super fun romantic, ERP, and D&amp;D roleplays, both oneshots and campaigns/long term relationships. \n\nOver time, and especially with a lot of partners (pick-up public chatroom ERP and hosting public AL D&amp;D) I was able, through a lot of tough trial and error, recognize the kind of people that are likely to \"reciprocate/reward effort input\" and the kind of people who are leechers or bad apples. Over time you can spot the bad ones from afar and simply side-step ever interacting with them.",

Even in my own rp group, I get the feeling that no one would even care if the server got nuked and was gone. I say this because recently someone came into the discord server and spammed in it with their server invites. Even with +20 pings the responses boiled down to \u201cwow twenty pings? Glad my phone was on mute\u201d or a \u201cr/thathappened\u201d response and went on posting memes. And most of these people I invited were close friends of mine + mutual rp individuals...",

Just one tiny example: JUST NOW I just got back from running a public 5-hour D&amp;D game with total random people. 4 of them were awesome people! 1 was intentionally trying to mess up the whole game and sabotage everyone else. So right up front I told her: Cooperate with your fellow players and work together or I'm going to kick you from the game. And she did!  In my weekly home D&amp;D game, the players are carefully built up from a list of the best people I've met in the public games.",
