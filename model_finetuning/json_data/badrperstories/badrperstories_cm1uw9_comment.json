I've had a handful of partners that just up and disappeared after months and some after a day of responses. It always sucks when you make a character, talk to each about the plot and get going just to be left on \"Read\" or \"Delivered\". Honestly it's more disheartening than anything and makes me wanna stop trying cause I feel like I'm not good enough but don't receive constructive criticism if it is my fault.",

I always thanked them for their time but I understand not everyone is like this, which could be why ditching is a common occurrence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt can be very irritating and make someone want to stop the hobby all together.
