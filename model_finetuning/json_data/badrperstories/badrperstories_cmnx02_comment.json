You want them to stop talking altogether? Why aren't they allowed to share their own experiences and stuff they like? isn't that what conversations are about? Keep the chatter flowing by adding your own stuff and encage them, you can't blame someone for being talkative if you are too shy to talk. \n\nHonestly, I would just leave if someone had the audacity of telling me how I'm allowed to participate in the on-going convos.

Others have crafted the atmosphere to an impenetrable ball where some who are more extroverted feel like they can't have any say. People were \"asked to leave\" simply because they shared their excitement over plots, characters, and personal connections outside of the RP. The people who don't want to talk are the people who have been pushed into a corner by being told to shut up. I'm one of those people. I was fully willing to contribute, be nice, and enjoy making new friends until others started projecting their insecurities on members who didn't deserve it. This person IS friendly and IS a great writer. She is being bullied and it's not okay. I read the channel you wrote about and nothing wrong happened, there was no drama until others crafted it.\n\nNo one should be afraid to be excited about their characters, plots, etc. And no one should feel like they can't be friendly and enjoy conversations. Making a vague post only exacerbates the problem. You're in the wrong, in my opinion, and it makes me not want to participate on the forum more. The bullies are the problem, not this person.",

Ya know, there are two good responses here relating essentially to the fact that there are many, many different people who join RP. Not everyone will always mesh, but does that mean one person should be singled out and damned? A whole group of people singled out and forced away? \n\nIn my experience, RP, especially accompanied by Discord or other open chat forums, are used for escape. RP, in my opinion, should not be a chore. People show up to write and make new friends even if they are a world away. Your \"anonymous\" griping and whining is a rotten apple contaminating the bunch. In all truth, this reeks of bullying.\n\nMaybe at this point, if so many feel as you do, the board and discord should be privatized to a particular party of people. If you feel so strongly about someone else's excitement or, in this case, attempts to correct an issue they were already beaten down about maybe you are the one who needs to take a step back and look at your own issues. Projection is an ugly thing. Charging self awareness on someone while you have none is just \"gross\".",

It would be a sad thing to see you go but if it's what's right for you then I hope you find somewhere you can feel better. And don't feel like you have to end the discussion here, unless you want to. And thank you for opening up and explaining your side in the comments; it's hard to speak out when others disagree with you and you're brave for expressing your feelings. I promise I don't pretend it doesn't exist and I will work harder on seeing the perspective of those who are more introverted. I personally also have anxiety issues, though they are triggered by different things, so I'm sorry that you have to feel this way. Anxiety heckin' sucks and I hope you're okay. As far as a solution, do you think it would be good to have a separate channel for plot discussion where it would be encouraged to only talk about characters/plots/personal matters there? Thus leaving the rest of the channels open to others? Or maybe a \"quiet\" chat for those feeling left out or annoyed by the more talkative people?\n\nI don't want to see anyone bullied, neither the person you spoke of OR you. I think the \"problem\" is a mixing of personalities that don't always mesh. It could be easily solved with more separation to let people have their space instead of asking people to leave or making more introverted people feel buried. Do you think this would be a good solution to suggest to help everyone involved?",
