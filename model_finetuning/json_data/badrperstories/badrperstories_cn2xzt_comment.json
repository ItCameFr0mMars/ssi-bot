I answered and left it be. My answer? \u2018Tell them how you feel and leave the forum\u2019. \n\nSo. What did the thread tell us?\n\nIt told us that someone on this mystery forum was emotionally manipulating the admins. Crying up storms, playing the victim time and time again. Regardless of your skill, this behaviour is unacceptable. It\u2019s immature. I would choose a partner who spouted three liners over a novelist who acted this way. It\u2019s indicative of narcissism. It\u2019s a way I acted when I was younger and I will fully admit that.\n\nThere was mention that this person was also conversationally rather annoying. They would interrupt conversations, one-up others, barge into things. A minor annoyance, but on a forum website this behaviour grows especially annoying. Especially when they\u2019ve been TOLD to stop and do not.\n\nIn conclusion- you\u2019ve started this thread stating the older one said a myriad of things that it did not. You claim whoever started it was projecting insecurities. It\u2019s amusing that you\u2019ve gone and made up these claims. That smells like projection to me. It makes ME think that the thread was completely telling the truth, that this whiny roleplayer sniffed out this thread, bullied the person who made it and made THIS one to cast themselves in a good light.
