I'm a waller of myself but there are different types of wallers. \n\n There are wallers that only wall when the other person is happy to wall too - so it's not like you are forcing them to wall because you are walling. There are also wallers that wall only when something serious happens?, e.g. A sudden event or a shocking discovery. There are also some that just see it as a way to describe their character's inner thoughts better. It all depends on what type of roleplayer they are, and if they are a 'casual' or 'competitive'.\n\n \n I always like to see people wall, as it is a nice read to see more detail regardinh an event, character's motives or emotions when written well. However, there's a limit. It all depends on a scenario, but I still think that there should be a healthy limit to walling and not... Well...

I tend to focus more on the character's thoughts, feelings, back history of why they act in a certain way, and even the world around them. So, post tends to get long when writing all that with multiple characters at once but I have also written with someone similar to person 2, and we both enjoyed the experience of roleplaying with each other.  \n\n\nIt is not about one style is preferred over the other, it all depends on what YOU are looking for and what YOU can manage with. Neither is better than the other, it all boils down to the style of how you write.",

As long as someone does a basic description I find that's enough. I don't need someone to go into detail on someone's buttons on a dress. Then again I work long hours and even more on other side projects that I do so I don't have much free time and I find the second style works better with my personal schedule.",
