I mean, I don't know what you're RPing... if you're RPing about abusive relationships and self harm and rape then yeah maybe it is detrimental, idk.  Or maybe they are using the RP to process their own grief and it helps them, who knows.\n\nI feel that it's a little callous to cut contact with someone because they attempted suicide, but ultimately another person's mental health isn't your problem to deal with and you have to do what's best for you.",

This is not a realistic time frame. Even as sparse of detail as this post is, there are so many red flags. So many red flags. \n\nYou're obviously a good person, concerned with the well being of others. People will take advantage of that. People take even more advantage of it in the RP community, because it is easier to do online through RP than in real life. \n\n\" I feel like if I end the chat, even with explanation, they will get more depressed and possibly try again? I dont know if thats irrational I'm just freaking out right now. \"\n\nThis is literally what they are intending to do. Make you doubt yourself, and concoct horrible 'what if' scenarios that will keep you willing to suffer their abusive BS because something worse might happen to them, if you stop. If you don't free yourself now, then it will keep happening. They'll effectively turn you into a barbie-doll to use as a soundboard, and they'll use your reactions to entertain themselves. \n\nGet.
