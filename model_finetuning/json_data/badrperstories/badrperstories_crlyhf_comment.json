There\u2019s always a common trend amongst rpers: nobody likes to play a weak character, Why? Because some people think that if you play a character with more flaws than perks, you won\u2019t be as important in the story or you\u2019ll become everyone\u2019s first target to beat up or kill...cause you\u2019re \u201cweak\u201d.  [Note: when I mean by a weak character, I mean that they\u2019re either a support role that does less damage, are non-combatant, or have many weaknesses that affect their abilities.]\n\nYour friend needs to learn how to tone it down in terms of what they can do. I would suggest you both creating a character sheet of your characters on what they can or cannot do. Set some guidelines and rules for character sheets (EX your character is REQUIRED to have at least two weaknesses, your character\u2019s abilities have to project what is on their character sheet and if the powers/abilities that they have are too op, they will need to adjust them in order to play them.) All of this is so that they can\u2019t make their character do whatever they want on a whim. \n\nIf your friend isn\u2019t on board with this idea, the fuck it, stop rping with them. It\u2019s not worth the trouble. Ya can still be cool but I don\u2019t think it can work out when you both rp.",
