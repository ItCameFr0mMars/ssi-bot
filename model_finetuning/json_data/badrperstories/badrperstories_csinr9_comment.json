I feel they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed in their IRL relationships, with an attitude like that.\n\nI don\u2019t block people over discord anymore if I\u2019ve been ghosted, I just remove them as a friend.

It's just a thing she does every so often. She's lost so many friends because of it, people who think her mental issue is a betrayal or a sign that she doesn't really like them. She cried when my friend reached out.\n\nNot saying it's always the case. Some people really are just assholes or don't know how to say they don't actually like you when you're nice to them. Nor am I saying you should reach out even if you do think it was a mental issue because that's not your responsibility. But it's a reason for ghosting that most people don't think of.",
