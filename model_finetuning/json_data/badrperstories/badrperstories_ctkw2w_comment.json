Trust me, this will not be the first time somebody quit contacting her.\n\nBut if you do not want to do this, my advice is to write her a quick note, similiar to this: 'Hey, I realised that we are not on the same page when it comes to writing RPs. I have the feeling that I have to walk on eggshells every time we interact with each other, which is very draining for me. I do not think that this will change in the near future, so I believe that it is better if we both search for a new writing partner. Best wishes.' Or any other phrasing that suits you. If she overreacts again, who cares? Simply do not reply. Sometimes, it is okay to simply walk away from a situation.",
