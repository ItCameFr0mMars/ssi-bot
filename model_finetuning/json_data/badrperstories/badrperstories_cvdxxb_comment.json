What I'd do is just try to tactfully explain that while you do appreciate their attention to detail, that you do not need things spoonfed to you. They may end up leaving anyway, even if you approach it as nice as possible but that's just the state of the community, unfortunately. IMO you'd be better off without them if that's how they take it. RPing is supposed to be for fun after all.",

Please assume I know what I'm talking about otherwise, I've had a lot of partners constantly explain things to me about my characters I already know, and it's getting exhausting for me. I don't mean to be rude, it has just been an issue for me and I'd like to address it honestly.\"\n\nAnd/or \"If it seems like I dont know what I'm talking about, please ask if that is the case before explaining how things work.\"\n\nIdk. If they're not okay with you communicating how you feel, they don't deserve your time, just make sure you try to communicate properly and address it before it's a big issue. Ignoring or pushing away something that's bothering you is never healthy for anyone involved.",
