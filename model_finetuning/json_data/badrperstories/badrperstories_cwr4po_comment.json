            "body": "I'm in the same server as OP, and I thought I'd share some other tidbits.\n\n\\- Hammer apparently has a habit of self-harming. R never explained why, which reeks of \"13 year old who just found out what self harm is and thinks that making characters do it gives them depth.\" Trust me, I was that 13 year old. One of my characters (Let's call him Masky) also self harms, but it was explained that he does it for sexual pleasure and money. Tip to any aspiring RP'ers/Writers out there, don't make your characters self harm for no reason. Give a reason, because people in real life don't do it for no reason. Self harm isn't something to be thrown around as a character trait, it has to be handled with tact.\n\n\\- OP solved one of the cases that R was the killer for in like, 15 seconds, because one of my characters (Reptile) stuck his hand in a hole in the floorboards and found Duck's hairclip. LOL.\n\n\\- One of R's characters from the previous round we did (Mushroom) gave us the glorious meme of a line that was \"force feeding people salt can be considered murder because of sodium poisoning.\" Just thought I'd share that with the world, as it gets referenced to this day.\n\nI don't wanna be too harsh on the guy, he's clearly young, but I swear to god, I wanna kick him in the teeth sometimes.",

Mod literally had to remind him that Hammer had done nothing to warrant that position, and he eventually accepted.\n\nSo, yeah. Hammer's dead. Good night, sweet prince. o7",
