If I play a female character, often all of these traits get sexualised by my writing partners, and is annoying as hell. For example: a country that has a strict woman as a leader? She is sooo hot and femdom is great. A shy character whose shyness gets into her way? Oh my, cute baby, she is so shy, the male character NEEDS to protect her. A bitchy female character who mocks the other characters? She needs to be a tsundere who later falls in love with the male character. If i did not write my characters this way and they were not centered around their romantic interest, all the RPs ended pretty fast. If I tried to give my female characters more depth/unusual traits, rarely anyone wanted to write with them, and I was told that they are ugly/boring/and so on.",

Used to happen to me when I was just starting out. It's incredibly disheartening when you spend time building a character, fill out the app and then nobody is interested. If you can't catch a break or get your foot in the door, there's no point in sticking around.\n\nThough I've been fortunate with my post apocalyptic adventures. I've played a con woman that basically amounted to the equivalent of a door to door salesman (no femme fatale here) a veteran turned rancher (she was like 54 yrs old and very well received) and a scavenger that was kind of a bitch/mess and preferred robots to people. They all had great reception. None had any romances going either (though I do like a nice slow burn romance)\n\nI totally feel you with an evil female character. I feel like peoples minds just got to this femme fatale esque ideal. The same goes for con women characters. People have such of a hard time wrapping their heads around a con woman that literally doesn't use seduction at all.",

My biggest issue with the rape backstory in particular is that it never really affects the character, or change their dynamic, and if it was suddenly revealed, it rarely ever affects the relationships built with them.

Not everyone who is raped follows the trope of being super moody and cold.

If a character is described as surly, people assume their player wants to roleplay a surly character. If that character carries a sword, we assume the player probably wants to do swordfighting stuff. If the character is female, then - to people for whom the \"default\" gender is male and anything outside that norm must have some hidden meaning - they assume the player is looking for sexy times.\n\n*&lt;/end amateur psychological pseudo-science&gt;*",

It took a lot of work to gain the experience so that I could tell from the other writer's profiles/characters if my characters would be (most likely) well received or not.\nI agree with you, if you find the right writer's, these character's can be well received. Not all of my experiences are bad, many people who I wrote with also said something like 'Oh, your character's are different and that is interesting'. But it is (in my opinion) sometimes a bit harder to find someone who thinks this way. For example, for 1 on 1 RPs, I get approximately 1-2 messages if I write down my real preferences (not much romance, interesting (female) characters who are not flawless, and so on), and I used to get around 7 if I just went with whatever was popular. I can get that many people think 'Oh, it is expected to write female characters this way, my characters are so much more popular now , so I will just go with it.'\nI agree with you on the con woman thing. There are so many ways to handle a female character like this, but many people automatically assume a female con man to be a seductress and their con to be something similiar to 'She tricks men into marriage and then runs of with the money.'",
