I never understood it myself. \n\nI've been on a few communities and thus far, I agree with the OP that Reddit is the absolute worst I've seen with ghosting and I just don't see a way around it. It sucks. It really can demotivate a person to partake in the hobby, which is frustrating because like yourself, I RP to destress and it helps keep my mind off things that I'm going through IRL but it can really make someone completely lose interest in the hobby all together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sure hope you find someone who at least sticks around because while they're few and far between, I have found a few that do stick around and once you find them, it's amazing.",

This is worsened by the fact these types of roleplayers can have many \"candidates\" to choose from and that gives them the feeling of power. Swipe left, swipe right, they no longer see the person behind the account.\nI hope that person and the others who wronged you wake up one day with the realization this kind of insatiable hunger will leave them unhappy, having missed out on you, a fantastic rp partner.\nConsider a solo project for a while, little drabbles of ideas you wanted to rp out. I'm using drabbles as both minifics and rp starters, at the same time! Either way, it is a productive outlet of imagination!\n\nYou deserve better!!!",
