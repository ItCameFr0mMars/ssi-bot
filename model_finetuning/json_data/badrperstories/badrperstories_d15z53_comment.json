Sure, it was unfortunate and hard for these people to find someone to play male characters. But all this 'if you play a man for my romance story, I will play a man for yours' only ended in both people being frustrated. It often lead to people loathing writing their male characters, while their partners were disappointed with the storyline, because they could feel that their partners did not really want to write that.",
