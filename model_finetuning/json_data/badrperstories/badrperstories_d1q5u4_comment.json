And also I appreciate you taking your time out of the day to read through my experience \n\nAnd that's a wonderful advice! I was actually thinking about doing this to slowly build my confidence back up and to be able to bring these characters back to a life. Releasing a novel is one of my dreams one day. \n\nI am currently working on a short drabbles and smaller fanfictions for one of my favorite fandoms- since I still love writing. I do realize that it is not writing for just me, but for other people, but so far the reception's been well (which makes me very happy). So it's been a form of therapy for me. Although, I try not to depend on other people for the reception and acceptance because if anything what this experience taught me- is that I need to know enjoy it too what I am doing.",
