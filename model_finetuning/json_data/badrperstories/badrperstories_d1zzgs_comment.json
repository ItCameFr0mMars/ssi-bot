The one-on-one scene can take a lot of time to get anything out of\u2014finding a single person who is both fully invested, committed and reliable as a writing partner can be a long shot. Meanwhile, if you have a group, you at \\*least\\* have a bunch of possible partners who have already agreed to be part of the session ahead of time. That way, if somebody disappears, you're more likely to have other options to fall back on. It's like casting a wide net! \n\nThere's always the risk that a bigger group means more chances for drama, of course, but you can find some excellent story potential if you're lucky and careful enough.",

You don't necessarily have to call it quits; you can just step back for a bit!  \n\n\nYou did ask for tips on how to get noticed, too, though, didn't you? Sorry for not answering before\u2014I totally missed it! The first thing I'd suggest is thinking about how you're pitching yourself. Are you clear and specific on what kind of stories you want? What content you want? Are the subjects you want to write for on the niche side, or generally popular? Do your partners have a good idea of what you're looking for before they take you up on your ad and get your starter? It'd be easier to give advice if we had an idea of what you're already doing, but generally, if you're more concerned about getting noticed than being picky, I'd say you want to lean into the \"market\" demands of wherever you're looking. I don't think it's necessarily ideal, but it's a start.",

Not a lot of people are willing to pick up that kind of burden, at least not without promise of some sort of serious reward... it's not just the effort of trying to flesh out extra characters, it's also that writing just *one* character that 'worships' the other player's character for some improbable reason is really dull, let alone multiple.\n\nThe second is that you are looking for canon characters, which also puts off a lot of people. I personally love established settings but avoid playing established characters, as it rarely goes well... people have very different views of how particular characters would react in a situation.\n\nAnyway, that's why I suspect you're not getting a lot of attention on your ads.",

They have to play multiple canon characters, for the sole purpose of these characters fawning over your male character. The only 'choice' they get is how old you character will be in some of your prompts, which...is not much.\n\nThat is just not a very interesting setting for most people, which is most likely why your prompts go unnoticed. My tips will most likely not be very helpful for you, but have you ever thought of maybe also playing a canon male character for your partner, or  offering them the chance to also invent their own female trainer?
