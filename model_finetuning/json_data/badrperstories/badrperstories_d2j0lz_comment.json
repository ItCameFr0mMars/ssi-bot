I'm honestly surprised I even found one person, I wasn't expecting much since it was a very, very specific request.",

It'll reassure people that your level of writing is what they're looking for.\n\n2) Try and avoid canon characters. I know it's what you're looking for, but it drastically reduces interest in your prompt as you're limiting it to people who are interested in playing that character over their own preferences, and who are willing to deal with the difference in perspective on that character between you and them. If you want canon characters, then you're going to have to offer a lot more from your side in return to balance out the effort.\n\n3) Try and give more of an idea of what you are intending for the RP... some sort of storyline? A reason for your character and theirs to interact? A scenario, and how it fits into the chosen setting? More details about the character you are going to play, if yours is original.\n\nAs it is, your prompts come across a bit as if you're just looking for someone to write tailored erotica for you about your preferred R34 likes, which is a bit of a one-sided offering. I'm not saying that *is* what you're looking for, but any RPer with some experience on here will have come across people looking for exactly that, and it's just so much easier to ignore the prompt and move on than it is to risk it.\n\nBasically you need to include some assurance that you're going to give as much as receive :)\n\nGood luck with your next prompt!",
