            "body": "Only ones I've had played to completion were episodic in nature. I played a Zoroark who was eventually caught by a Trainer he befriended that initially thought he was a human. They're a Fox-Pokemon that can cast illusions, including speech. \n\nAnyway, me and the player got along really well. We've actually met each other IRL twice now. But I think why it went well was our characters meshed, we meshed, and we had the same taste in plotlines. Their story is still technically ongoing, but I had a RP hiatus for about a year due to failing health, and I'm just now starting to get back into it. Haven't figured out where we're going to put those two next though, so for now we're RPing in a different setting as different characters. \n\nI actually wrote a stupid long writeup on the plot just to kinda preserve what happened in my head. I never finished the whole thing because honestly they were some loooong RPs. But here if you're really that interested: [linky](http://ichno.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=arcs:boyanddoggo)\n\nThis is kind of a mix between 1x1 RP and group-rp. So take that how you will. \n\nAs for the others in the group, first person to play with us ghosted, so we had to basically move on without them. We went 1x1 for a while. After that, we joined a large group RP. At first it was weird, and we were a touch off put, but since we liked each other and our characters, we pulled through. It got a lot better after that, at least up until I got sick. Someday we'll return to our roots. Someday.",

            "body": "I've been in few successful rps, but I'll mention three which are Dec, Jun and Jul(Not real names - just when the rps started - so don't ask me for them, but perhaps someone will know them, who knows).\n\n First, Dec. It soon will reach its first year - it started in December last year and lasted 6 months. A Killing Game where I've met most of my pals in. Not only did I polish on my walling and roleplaying skills(I had a shitty character then, but she was still enjoyable so I succeeded?) while I was also able to make a lot of new friends; I even ended up being a mod for the third installment!\n\n That roleplay helped me get through some hard times. It was my Exam year, so near the middle and end I was in and out on exams and what can I say except that all of them were supportive? They didn't mind me not roleplaying because they knew I had to focus on my studies and all.\n\nAnd feels. Oh God the feels. Most of the characters made me weep, especially the mastermind. I kid you not, he made me cry for 4 hours straight, and everytime someone mentions him now too, I get teary eyes due to the fun memories I formed with  them; he was such a great character - nearly everyone there was.\n\n\nNow Jul. That roleplay didn't end yet - it just begun - but it's still amazing and I just know it will be successful. The mods are amazing, the cast is so chaotic and memey that it's pure hilarity. Despite us being at the beginning of chapter 2, everyone has such a blast with everyone - creating memes and CAH cards - and it's just so pleasing to see. Everyone is such s friend there.\n\n The cast in itself is Amazing with a capital A. Everyone is likable and it hurt when the first murder happened and then the trial because two characters died that didn't deserve it in retrospect(In my opinion that is) but it worked out so well. I have high hopes for that roleplay, and I just know it will be amazing.\n\n\n And now, Jun. Hands down my favourite roleplay. Firstly, the atmosphere of the server itself is so positive: everyone knows each other, jokes, is there for others - that server is just one, chaotic and big family. Wherever someone feels down, everyone is there to support them in any way they can and wherever someone is happy with something, everyone else is also happy with it. The other two rps also are like this, but with Jun, I just feel more safe and happy if that makes sense. \n\n And the cast. Once again, my favourite out there. I love everyone there and I cried on every murder and execution - except first one because I was on a train - and it was just a big ride. It's currently on chapter 5 when I'm writing this and I can safely say that it will be successful too. The mods are doing God's work: Pushing the boundaries, trying out new things and always giving people something to do. The cases were also amazing and I just love it.\n\n Makes me regret I volunteered for victim, because there's so much to do after I died *but the angst was worth it.*",

I was really new to warhammer back then, and didn\u2019t notice all the weird things about it, and being new to the place in general, I of course didn\u2019t see all the OOC drama.\n\nBeing also new to RP, I had a lot of fun and quickly made friends there, both IC and OOC. Well, as I got more and more into the lore and learned more from my friends there, I also began to notice a lot of the weird things. There was drama, mods being weird, bad RP\u2026 the works. Then I was made mod, and saw all the other skeletons lurking in the closets. By that time I\u2019d been there for probably half a year or so, and both me and my friends - by that time we\u2019d become the largest IC faction, kinda ended up making our own place. \n\nThere was of course a lot of drama surrounding it, but we got through it, recruited a bunch of people, and set up our own place. We had some trouble over the year and a half, some asshole members that got thrown out, some bad RP, but most of it got contained quickly. Now we\u2019re a smallish community, but fairly stable and with over all pretty good RP. Shit happens everywhere and we\u2019re not perfect, but I think we\u2019re in a pretty good place now.",

We had a group thread going with about 10 people and it worked like a dream until someone ghosted and we lost half characters involved.\n\nI've got a personal RP going on with a buddy and it's inspired us to create an entire world - we're both pedantic - and pimp it out as a freeform RP place.  Another personal one I started with someone has involved into a collective idea for us to write a novel together involving those characters.  I've had very few RPs that have gone this well but when they do it's so, so good.",
