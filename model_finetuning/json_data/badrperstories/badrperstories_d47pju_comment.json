I love the concept of RPing, being able to write a story together with someone but I don't know if its a sign of the whole 'cancel culture' or what but it is very hard to find someone who is dedicated. I do have a friend whom I have been writing with for years but besides her, I honestly expect everyone to ditch sometime. It creates unnecessary stress and anxiety. It's horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember when I first started RPing on AIM chat rooms, it was never like this. People had common courtesy. Now it's just almost too stressful for its own good. I personally don't mind if someone needs to stop an RP but a simple note is all I ask for and that's too hard for 99% of the community, at least in my experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, you're going through this too.",
