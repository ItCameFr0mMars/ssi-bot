These days, people prefer using actors or models for their faces, and I do not mind it, so long as it is just a reference.  I use them myself now, but often I change details like eye color, maybe hair color, add scars, weight, etc, but it gives me and the other person something to kind of base it on, if that makes sense?  Like my character might look similar to Johnny Depp, but they are definitely NOT him/I am not playing him or his characters he has portrayed? (for example)\n\nI have noticed, however, those that demand a certain face be used for them to romance or become obsessed over play a lot of self inserts and want to play out their own personal fantasy, which is fine when the other person is in the know, some people do not mind playing it.  But to complain your character is not 'hot' enough makes me feel their focus is purely on romance/smut.  \n\nI have also used a face and somebody became obsessed, expecting them to be like a certain character from a show when my character's personality was completely different, and then getting mad when they did not play out like in their head.  Now when people get like that, I know to bail, because it is just drama and not the sort of roleplaying I am looking for.",
