            "body": "omega yikes. I hate when these kind of people are around. Potential for good writers but deep down they're putting in efforts to depict some sort of cosplay for their political bullshit.\n\n\\[massive fucking rant regarding this inbound, only read if you like long shit\\]\n\none time I was part of a server that hosted a variety of players, some good, others absolute trash. Well, now the server is completely overrun with a world depicting 26th century Nazis lead by clones of SS members born in the late 1800s. Yeah. Good luck playing an alien, (which I obviously did) because you were either ignored or ganged up against both IC and OOC and the staff (except for one) didn't do a thing to prevent it, even implementing A RULE meant to enable these people. (Outside of your race/faction's main area, you can lose death consent for essentially any reason, no matter who attacks you, your intentions, or the situation) Encounters in exploration would usually go down like this: \n\n\\*put together a small crew, converse, interpersonal relationships, conflict and bonding begins.\\*\n\n\\*get mission, go somewhere.\\*\n\n\\*in between the way, get a transmission in german (each time they act like its supposed to be some sort of scary or mysterious first contact)\\*\n\n\\*the fucking three thousandth reich shows up 3000 to 1 for your tiny insignificant crew, boards your ship and either nullifies, ignores or powergames any attempt to defend yourself of flee\\*\n\n\\*they pick an alien, preferably played by the newest member, and slaughters them. new player is understandably frustrated, to where they head into OOC and question the fairness of it only to get chastised, made fun of, called a furry, \"dude, why are you taking this so seriously\", etc.\\*\n\n\\*the whole mission is now about the fucking heertards even though we did a mission regarding your stupid fucking nazis in space last time and the time before then\\*\n\n\\*crewmembers are killed, women are threatened to be raped, the players of the human members of the crew could care less or put any kind of fucking effort into their posts or react to your crewmember dying or being threatened with fucking rape you absolute apathetic dumpster of garbage\\*\n\n\\*people go home, rinse and repeat\\*\n\nthe server just became a massive wehraboo circlejerk and a pretty toxic place. the prominent players of said nazi faction didn't even rp much or *had* good rp, the owner met them in an ERP server and flooded them in and severely alienated the original crowd of the server, as it basically became a playground for them as well as a gateway for them to lead into nazi catgirl futanari erp in their dms (yes, the nazi people unironically had fucking catgirls and kitsunes, and all their female characters were massive breast bimbo futas who wore lingerie on the job. am not fucking making this up i swear.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nokay, finally to the part that this textwall is about - massive effort in worldbuilding to be snuffed out because their politic = good so therefore my fictional politic and race should be powergamed to oblivion.\n\nI had a race and faction called the Ixaszi, they were an avian species resembling birds of prey along with prehistoric raptors. They were basically a collection of nomadic warlords who all resided in massive vessels with each having their own little society and mini city within. I put a lot of work into building the lore and world around them, with individual vessel cultures, maps of the major ships, their history of basically being asexual genetically modified soldiers from an ancient race, who have to use birthing pods and rare material to slowly replace anyone killed, and a lot of invasive cell revitalization and prosthetics to keep people from dying as well. It was a fragile, yet proud and strong society, and a lot of the earlier players complimented me on my work, and were intrigued at exploring the hubs and quests I made for them, slowly revealing additional info, details and story about the Ixaszi.\n\nWell, once the owner and his sex club flooded the server, I didn't make up the brunt of the worldbuilding chat anymore, which I would have loved, if the worldbuilding wasn't their shit-tier nazi garbage. (I don't care what the beliefs of your fictional culture is, but I can fucking tell when somebody is making a morally challenged nation, and when they're making a personal political fantasy) What pissed me off, was that their obviously not!helghast, 40k and iron sky crossover generated interest from the majority of players, when they were just throwing dumb shit or hateful shit around and supplementing it with pictures of promiscuous artwork taken from google images of nazi babes because \\*drools\\* \"buh buh grug wan erp.\"\n\nI call them out on lazy or ridiculous stuff. Guess their reply. *Guess their fucking reply.*\n\n***\"I just wanna have fun, why do you gotta judge me?!\"*** bitch I'm asking you to be more creative because that would be more fun.\n\nwell, it all came to an end after their space nazis that everyone loved, became apologists of and virtually fucked came to kill off my race because alien that's not a fuckable elf with lewd stolen artwork or slightly miscolored human = furry which = bad!!!! On a festival for the more religious Vessels while the nomadic armada was docked at a supply outpost planet, when people's guards were down, they launched an attack on us, which, was understandable and I would be  okay with, even suffering massive losses, if they weren't such powergamey low-effort shits. Ixaszi-\\*insert german sounding name\\* relations weren't too good, only reluctantly working together to destroy larger threats a few times. (which of course we were mostly ignored by the gms lmao while they and the not!alliance from ME got all the glory and focus)\n\nAnyways, so basically, once it started I wrote up tactics and such of the fleet as they try to destroy the attackers, not overly detailed but enough effort to depict the massive macro retaliation that millions of people in thousands of ships would take to ward them off or tactically retreat. Meanwhile I usually got posts that boil down to \"we less ships but we have bigger better gun so we always kill\" or even fucking one liners. We basically ended up retreating and spreading out across star systems and regrouping into separate task groups to counterattack and eventually reform the Armada, but these people just kept pulling vessels and resources and shit outta their ass, chasing me like the damn rebels from FTL, and only just throwing in token vessel destruction so it doesn't look like they're powergaming. I pretty much gave up as OOC grilled me each time I tried to dispute this blatant asspulling and powergame. Basically, they're dead now, they scuttled themselves because I didn't want to deal with any more bullshit and now are disconnected and dying off slowly without their ancient birthing pods anymore. I'm still there for whatever the fuck reasons but never have posted in months, just looking and laughing. Some people picked up aspects of my worldbuilding and just switched around names or details. I'm fine with that honestly, just as long as it isn't in the hands of unironic fascists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; put a lot of worldbuilding effort into a race of bio-soldier alien raptors in a shit place I used to be in, got eclipsed by a shitty online-4chan-fascism-politics-driven worldbuilding project by erpers, got powergamed and basically saw my work and writing shredded in front of me as I got laughed at, and some people picking up the scraps.",
