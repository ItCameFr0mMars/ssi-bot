I believe that if someone wants to roleplay characters like this (with a lot of trauma and a rather miserable life), it is extremely important that the person can separate between their own situation and their character, and your friend seems to be unable to do that. I would be unable to enjoy roleplaying such situations (although I love drama and angst) if I knew that it is my friends form of self depreciation. No wonder that it drags you down. You do not have to be ashamed of your feelings, I think a lot of people would get sad if they were in the same situation as you are.",

It got so bad at one point, I kept making my character attempt offing himself whilst my friend's character kept stopping mine. I only stopped doing that when my friend sat me down and told me flat to my face that it made him extremely uncomfortable. \n\nThat character of mine at the time I used a bit for venting purposes. He was like a semi persona, because I projected so much of myself onto him. It'd probably be best to explain to your friend you don't like it, if you get the courage to do so.\n\nAt one point I was even on the receiving end of that. Started a roleplay with this one chick who was always upset and insecure. I tried telling her it made me uncomfortable and stuck the plot (about superheroes) in one spot because she was constantly running away from my characters. That RP was quickly abandoned.",
