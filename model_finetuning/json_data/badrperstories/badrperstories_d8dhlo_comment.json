            "body": "I was somewhat of a story oriented and open world person so I\u2019ll share some things. The first thing I\u2019d like to start off is by saying you\u2019re doing a good job so far pitching everyone in and you all sharing you\u2019re ideas with each other. \n\nBut anyways, in my own experiences of making a plot, there\u2019s three things that would need to happen in other to avoid clashing plots. The one thing is that something has to happen that draws the attention of many character\u2019s together to that specific plot. Another thing would be the lore behind the story that connects the plot. An example would be a fantasy rp that has a tyrannical ruler. So let\u2019s say that this tyrannical ruler in the past has invaded many places because they have a *special power* that allows them to. These places have gone through raiders that killed and looted out of people\u2019s houses, this would be the lore. The plot would be that the citizens (or other outside influences) are forced to watch a execution or see peasants trying to escape a dungeon with deadly traps. \n\nThere\u2019s many types of characters that the rpers can be as. \n\nThe tyrant\u2019s servants/collaborators\n\nThe citizens (peasants, nobles)\n\nAnd even a outside 3rd party. (Organizations) \n\nThe last thing to avoid clashing plots is your own story. Your story itself has to be flexible on its own to allow many possible plot routes. One of the plot routes you can do in this example would be these. \n\n1) People forming a group to Stop the tyrant. \n\n2) Exploring the \u201cspecial power\u201d that the tyrant [and his servants/collaborators] have and acquiring that power. \n\n3)  Being the Tyrant\u2019s Servant/collaborator. This could be someone who\u2019s either very loyal to the tyrant or questioning their own morals of following them. \n\n4) Being a citizen that\u2019s suffering or had suffered because of the tyrant. \n\nThis part requires to show someone\u2019s character\u2019s stance in the story. This can be citizens talking about the tyrants regime, the character\u2019s opinions about. It, and how has the regime affect not only them, but the people around them. It\u2019s going to be a messy story if a person makes a character for basically no reason and just going with the flow of what\u2019s happening. So make sure to plan situations that will make a character important and part of the story. \n\nI think that\u2019s just about it on my part. I hope you\u2019ll find these tips useful.",

I would recommend reconsidering what you plan to do to incorporate their ideas.\n\nNot that you have to do exactly what they want. But bring in their plot points and give them a chance, or challenge them to think of another path to success. Consider their character development. Part of your job is making them happy, not just marching them through your narrative.\n\n(I could be off the mark. I\u2019m not sure of the exact situation due to lack of details.
