And no being cool and calculating does not justify your character being an asshole. \nThe same goes the other way too. If my character is rude I\u2019m not expecting someone to be nice back to them or act like all is forgiven when my character didn\u2019t earn it.  Part of the fun of playing a mean character is seeing them get their karma. \nI have no problem with characters being dicks but if their gonna be a dick at least own it. Don\u2019t justify them and take the consequences that come with it.\n\n\nThat and railroaders/rushers/narrators. \nThe more you try to railroad me I can guarantee the less likely I am going to want to go down that path. \nNarrators not so much but you\u2019ll have people that\u2019ll try to rush through scenes or moments just so they can push their own narrative without giving my character a chance to react. Which is most often seen in combat or high action scenarios. \nI\u2019m not a big fan of combat since theirs no hard rules way to determine a winner unless if it\u2019s agreed upon before hand or if people are playing dnd. While combat can work it can often turn into a narration where people pretty much describe the whole fight before it\u2019s over or it gets into a power match where people try to nuke their opponent without giving them a chance to react.",
