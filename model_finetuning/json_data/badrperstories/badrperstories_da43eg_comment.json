            "body": "Ghosting is a very complicated topic, at least for me. In some instances, I find it somewhat justified. For example if the person is extremely toxic and you know that if you brought up it up to them before you 'leave', they would loose their shit. I would still at least send a short message like 'Sorry, it does not work between us', but I can understand the people who just ghost in these situations. Same thing with people you have already told over and over again 'Hey, if it goes on like this it is not working out' and they never change.\n\n I guess that with a lot of the mindsets you describe in your post, it started out with something like this, then it became more and more extreme. For example 'It is okay to ghost people if you really fear how they might react because they have been verbally abusive/manipulative in the past, remember, you do not owe them anything' slowly turning into 'Everyone who does not want to be ghosted is entitled, you do not owe them anything, do not pay attention to how they might feel at all, even if they did not do anything wrong'. And this turns people into very unpleasant people, but they feel fully justified because their friend circles encourage them and everyone who thinks differently is portrayed as 'entitled' or even emotionally abusive and wanting to force you to roleplay with them.",
