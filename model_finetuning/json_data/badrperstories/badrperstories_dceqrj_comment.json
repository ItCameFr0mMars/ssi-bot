My guess would be that he finds your current leaning with your characters unappealing, and as such gets hyper focused on the parts of the RP to be a pleasant distraction from what he's not enjoying. This isn't to say that your latest interest in playing sad and/or depressed characters is *bad*, just that it's not what he's interested in. \n\nIt might be time to part ways and look for other partners. This is about having fun, not suffering through one RP after another hoping something will stick when the reality is that your partner just isn't suitable to what you want.",

Have you tried to talk to your partner without accusing them of trying to push certain type of roleplay on you? Because it sound like both of you are just frustrated with the situation and that's never a good thing. Hinting and dancing around the issue is not gonna fix it, you gotta talk to them, ask them what they want from the roleplay and be honest if your interests simply don't match.\n\nMaybe consider branching out, roleplay with other people for a while. You could also try joining a group with your friend, that way there is a greater possibility for both of you getting to write what you want while still being part of the same community.",
