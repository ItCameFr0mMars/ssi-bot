She writes characters which you find too idealistic and kind (which I can understand), and you write brooding characters who are a bit of an asshole sometimes (and here, I can also understand that even if they have different  personalities, it might be hard to fit those characters into the RPs she likes to write, and she sometimes wishes for some more light-hearted characters). \n\nThen, you try to meet in the middle, but you end up being the one giving in. She tries to push your characters in a direction you don't want, you do not want to tell her that this bothers you. In the end, I think both parties are dissatisfied. She tells you that she finds certain reactions boring, you find the worlds you create shallow and soulless.\n\nTo be honest, I think it is better for both of you to search for a new partner who shares your preferences. You seem to loathe your RPs with her (which is fine, considering the way she acts). I would advice you to dump your stories. Your writing preferences do not seem to match, and I do not think that there is a solution that does not end with one of you having to write stuff you do not like to write.",

But she was very interested in light-hearted content, people being saved through the power of friendship, and if I wrote 'evil characters', she either wanted them to have immediate redemption arcs (not interesting for me, this takes work and sometimes I want my characters to be assholes) or she hated them and wanted to defeat them straight away. If we wrote darker themes, she often wanted them to have a 'solution' (for example my characters were allowed to have traumas, but I knew it would bother her if her characters did not always manage to cheer them up.) She was never toxic or mean to me, and I knew that she did not dislike my writing or (most) of my characters. \n\nStill, I found myself replying and thought 'why do I do this?', because I just was not able to find that stuff interesting. So I had to quit rping with her, and even though it was hard in the beginning (because I had put a lot of time into the RP, and I really liked her personally), we both found more suitable partners. I realized that I had forgotten how enjoyable RPs could be.",
