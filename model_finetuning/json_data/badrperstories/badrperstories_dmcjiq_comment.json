            "body": "Gonna put on my hobbyist psychology pseudoscience hat for a bit, here.\n\n&gt; \"idk why you need to be a powerful immortal creature to RP baking cookies or whatever it is they did all day.\"\n\nIn my experience roleplaying with strangers in forums, chats, and MMORPGs, people do not want to get hurt. I don't mean PHYSICALLY hurt, obviously, but *emotionally* hurt. They invest some of themselves into their original characters, and don't want to be abused.\n\nNow, when I say \"abuse\" I don't mean in a narrative sense. A meaningful defeat, a lesson learned through loss, a sick-as-hell battle scar, none of these things are abusive if they're something the player wants for their character. The abuse I'm talking about exists on a meta level: Being made to look stupid, getting ignored or being seen as irrelevant, generally anything which invalidates your character's concept and/or agency in the roleplay. No one wants to be [TNG Worf.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect)\n\nRoleplaying is a tango for two. When it comes to online venues, most times you're gonna be dancing with people you aren't very familiar with, meaning you are putting some of your character's fate into the hands of a stranger. People who are interested in a meaningful RP will probably treat you right based on what you both want to see in a scene... But what if they don't? What if they want to use your character as a springboard? What if they crush and embarrass your character just to show how powerful, handsome and cool their own character is? What if they're a selfish RPer who sees all other characters as side characters or fodder?\n\nFor some players, the answer is simple:\n\n* \"I can't be abused if I establish my character as being incredibly powerful - either by always being amazing, or by having a 'win' button I can press in case of emergencies.\"\n* \"I can't be abused if I don't participate in anything where I can lose.\"\n\nThe result: Incredibly powerful characters who do nothing.",
