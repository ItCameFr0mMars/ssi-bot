What did you argue about? What was bothering him/what was he yelling about? If I told someone my (negative) feelings about something, and they reacted as if it was just a game, I might be pissed of, too.\n\n  If he just wrote something like 'I am done!' and nothing more, I can understand that you thought it was part of the RP. It is so hard to tell, this story needs a lot more information in my opinion.",
