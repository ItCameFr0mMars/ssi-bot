But of course, her character could not know this except if someone told her about it and/or she is a mindreader. She basically only knew that he made one mean comment about her dress once. \n\nIf her female character had known all the stuff he did before, her reaction would at least have seemed not that blown out of proportion. I would still not have agreed with all the (almost) homophobic stuff, but the rest would have been at least a little bit more...appropriate?\n\nWe were both around 19 at that time.",
