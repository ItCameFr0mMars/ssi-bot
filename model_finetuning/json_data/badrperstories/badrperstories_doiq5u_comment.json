I got 0 comments and 14 PMs. You have no idea if you're the only one who responded.\n\nIf he doesn't want to rp with you, just let it go. It sucks getting excited about something and having your time wasted, but you guys clearly weren't a good fit. At least he cut you loose now rather than starting and ghosting.",
