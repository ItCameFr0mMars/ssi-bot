Not quite like a forum rp either. Basically, you join the main site, and if you have joined, you can take a look at all the rps other people have created and join them by applying for a role. If you are accepted by one of the moderators, you can start writing after you have created your character profile. The moderators of each RP can have specific rules (for example no racism/no Mary Sue character). If they delete your role/character, or you delete it yourself, you can not see the RP anymore or write there. You can also create your own RPs and accept people who apply for it. \n\nIt sounds constricting, but it has some good parts as well.",

Meaning that while you *may* be able to salvage it in the way that you both can part peacefully, there's no hope in getting a good RP here. From my experiences, if an issue boils down to \"Not my problem if you can't fit in\", then every explanation why this is a poisonous attitude will be very likely met with bad excuses or simply shrugged off. Especially since Kim was apparently blamed for hindering the game without doing anything. Because she *couldn't* do anything.\n\nNo, seriously, I can only advise you to tell her that you don't feel comfortable participating further after Kim left. And if Lena asks why, then feel free to tell her that while you really appreciate her support, you think her behaviour towards Kim was just alienating (Without accusing her of course) and that you have the feeling of being the favoured player.\n\nEven if Lena sees where she was wrong, it will never be the same again as the incident will keep nagging both of you in your minds and there's always the possibility of it repeating itself.",
