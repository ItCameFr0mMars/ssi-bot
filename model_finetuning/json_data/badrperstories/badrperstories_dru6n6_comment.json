A Discord group where you talk about non-RP related things, or RP-related things and generally just enjoy each other\u2019s company. \n\nPeople I RP with on a daily basis I also maintain PMs with daily, be it about the RP, our day, memes etc. \n\nThough sometimes you\u2019ll need to set rules. For example, RP moves every Saturday, and if someone hasn\u2019t posted by then, they\u2019re skipped and the cycle starts again. \n\nOtherwise try to get to know your members and see what keeps them engaged in RP. Everyone likes different things.",

            "body": "You will need to give more details on the situation, lest you want to get very general answers. Otherwise, the responders will only make assumptions to fill the gaps. For example, based on the fact the only people replying are a select few, and the rest phase in and phase out, I can assume the plot you're moving forward is rooted in exclusivity and does not allow for new members to organically enter and make a difference. When they do, they find a small cohesive group that is happy between themselves and does not need or want a new member. They feel excluded, lose interest in the story, and leave. If that is what is happening, the answer is obvious - dedicate more time to your newer players than to those already established, until they become part of the group. If not - well, give context.",
