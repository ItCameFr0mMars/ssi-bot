            "body": " I need a little more info here, to understand your character fully. How old was the brother, how old was the character when it happened, was the brother directly abusive to her? For example, the situation would be very different for me if a 15 year old girl killed her 8 year old brother who just enjoyed that his dad liked him more and took a little advantage of that, or if a 11 year old killed her 17 year old brother who was a total asshole. Maybe you get what I mean. \n\nMaybe the other players misunderstood what you were trying to do with that character? Of course you can play characters which have been abused, but especially in settings with a lot of fighting going on and other character who also experience trauma/have their own issues, it can sometimes be a bit problematic, because other players might think 'Meh, my character has issues of himself (for example being scared easily), he has no time to pay close attention to every teammate.' or they are so involved in their own backstories that they forget to pay close attention to yours.\n\n In such settings, I often had the problem that I created a 'problematic' character with a sad backstory to explain some of his issues, but nobody payed close attention, so nobody really got close enough to him and he just remained just an asshole in their eyes. This happens, unfortunately.  \n\nIt can often be a little bit hard for other character's to get all the clues, and depending on the personalities of the other character's (which I of course do not know much about), I think some of the situations you describe can make more or less sense. For example, a character that has just lost his beloved mom and is grieving might not make the most rational decisions when it comes to who he blames for her death, and might cling to someone he already does not like as a scapegoat. Other situation seem a little bit over the top and unfair to me. What were the personalities of the other characters like? If everyone was going for 'socially challenged loner' it makes more sense to me than if some of the characters were supposed to be nice, sensitive people.",

            "body": "The brother was two years older, and indeed the brother was directly a part of the abuse. The \"punching bag\" part was the fact that her brother was trained to be a warrior. She was the convenient sparring partner as they grew up as the father wanted him to basically take his place. She was still big and strong, so so her father didn't allow her to fight back in case she would accidentally hurt him and slow his training down; she could just basically block. When they both grew up to be a part of the warrior society, he still used her as a \"punching bag\" for training. She killed him around when she was 17 and he was 19. \n\nNone of the players got this last part (which was why I didn't mention it), but for your curiosity I let you know. Her brother took credit for everything she did, but she ignored it and still got renown to match her brother. She was going to a trial by combat to rise in to a rank as high as her brother when she was ambushed. Her brother was worried about this and decided to attack her before she got there. His goal was just to wound her enough that she would have a disadvantage at the trial so even when she won the battle, she lost the war. She broke at that moment. She realized that if she let him live, he would just forever hound her. She ripped out his throat. Of course their Father was not far away, but only walked in to see the part where she ripped out his throat. Her father already had a story in his head that his son was just teasing her, and she was just jealous; so he just instantly knocked her out. Probably the only reason he didn't just outright kill her on the sight was because the punishments that they could do were far worse then a quick death.\n\nNow I totally get the whole \"have no time to pay attention to your character\" kind of thing, which is why I only got confused after soooo many things happened. The only thing that wasn't spelled out to them was the exact murder scene, and none of them questioned the story they were given of \"She just killed him because she was jealous,\" even after the dream sequence. She also saved them countless times. Throwing them away from a grenade, carrying their wounded body to safety, and was constantly the front line. You gotta question why a selfish jealous person would be doing all this. \n\nSure, if they ignored that and just thought she was an asshole, that would be fine, but they actively stared to blame her for everything.. and intentionally started saying what they knew would triggered her. It was so weird. Remember that whole scene of stopping one party member from killing another party member? Her and another party member jumped in to physically restrain the guy. The other guy failed, but she was strong and was able to rip away the knife so he couldn't harm anyone anymore. IMMEDIATELY the last party member jumped onto the knife wielder, healed them, and basically teleported him away (Unless you know or want me to explain the system, just accept it as a simple teleport.) Now, they barely succeeded in the teleport so the teleport was slow so everyone else followed. However knowing that they went slow (and meta gaming, but that's fine) He decided to STOP mid teleport. He was told \"You will die if you just stop. You can't turn around, it won't be long before things kill you here. You know this\" and his response was just \"I'd rather die here then let HER force us to do what she wants with her violence.\" I remind you that he's healing and helping the guy who held a knife to a different party member, and the whole reason that guy held the knife to the other character's throat? She had stopped him from smoking (which in this game is evil as it does literally taint you with evil). So we're all still good players, so when it takes too long for them to teleport, we teleport back which allows us to see them both stuck there. Both of us hold our hands out to get them unstuck and... they both almost don't take it. Two players were willing to sacrifice their characters to make sure that my character knew she was a horrible person because her disarming the guy had hurt him a little (again, we all regenerate super fast and can heal mystically in a pinch too), but him almost slitting the other player throat? \"He's obviously a troubled guy, it must have been more then just about wanting to smoke\"\n\nNow, for the other players characters. You are half right. ONE was a socially challenged loner. I think you could guess it's the one that pulled out the knife. The two of them did always butt heads. He one time threw a grenade into combat right next to two of us in an enclosed space. She pinned him to a wall and chewed him out. Later, he threatened to kill himself with another grenade he kept, she instead apologized and hugged him. After he lied several times, she still tried to trust him too and she always gave him space to make mistakes. The first one the left was a literal asshole that was trying to not take part in their responsibilities. We can skip him in the thought process here. The third (the one who's mom's death was blamed on my character) was a happy go lucky thief. There relationship was mostly fine. When that guy found out that people of the bigger group (NPCs) would intentionally wake my character up in the middle of the night to bother her, he pranked them. When they tried to punish him for doing that, My character stepped in between them and stopped them. He even reverse pick-pocketed skittles into her pocket to try and cheer her up sometimes. However, he still did blame her for his mom's death even though the other player was the real cause (which would be okay, like you said emotions were high), but still in the end when a vote from the group had them decide to go a different direction then he wanted, he joined the \"She's just using her brute strength to force us.\" \"the other's are just too afraid to vote against you\" and then shortly after left the game (and were killed off to help that, which... again... somehow got blamed on my character). The fourth was the only who never said anything wrong, the one who had the knife to their throat. She was wolf born, and was sort of a zen master. Her goal was literally to help balance the group, so when she learned everything that had happened, she was super confused like me (both in and out of character). For being the character with visions and lot of information on her... lot of people didn't listen to her either. 5th person, was a loner and he actually ended up going in a frenzy in the middle of a fight and killed the 6th player who would rather stand next to a person in frenzy, instead of my character \"in case she might frenzy too\". Don't worry though, 6th person was really just a character with an Irish accent.",

Purposefully triggering another character's trauma, especially if they are meant to work together and are not enemies is just...bad. Even if you could maybe excuse some of the characters because of personality issues, an entire group scapegoating someone who has safed them multiple times is just bad writing on their part. Especially if some characters are willing to actually get hurt instead of...facing the possibility that your character who has never hurt any of them without a reason might act totally out of character and suddenly attack them?\n\nLet me be honest, in my opinion some of the players in this RP sound a bit like they enjoy over the top drama with their character in the center a little bit too much. No wonder that they need a scapegoat. I think if everyone is mean to one character, but treats it like it is normal, it is hard for the writers who might not think this way to resist this, because it is so normalized and they maybe do not want to be one of the only ones with an opposing view . \nSounds super frustrating, it is a wonder that you kept going for so long. I am curious, did you ever really call them out, telling them in uncertain terms how stupid the behavior of their characters is?",

            "body": "Yes! I definitely did. And don't worry, I know you're not trying to prove me wrong. This is actually really validating and interesting to see that you have very similar feelings on the matter, and you and the other commenter are noting things I did as well. I'll explain how that went down.\n\nThe time with the guy with the knife, and the guy defending the guy with the knife was the when I told them in no uncertain terms how stupid the behavior was. I actually found a little of our argument survived, so I can be more exact in the quotes. He stated my character \"attacked one of \\[her\\] own pack members without any remorse\" and that he \"hasn't seen her ever try to actually resolve a problem\".  I can remind that again my character wasn't the only one who tried to stop the guy with the knife but was the only one called out for \"no remorse\". Also, I  hope it's obvious that she's tried to resolve this before. \n\nRemember how the whole issue started because the knife guy was smoking? We had previous sessions just told him to stop without physically stopping him, followed another session by pointing out that he was literally being tainted by it and needed to stop before it got worse, and then an ever later session we all were able to convinced knife guy to do a ritual to remove the taint because it was starting to be a problem (which included him promising to stop smoking). So when knife guy had pulled out another cigarette just a session later, it was very much a power move and that other character (It was the wolf zenmaster) who actually smacked it away was very justified and did it. And, when knife guy pulled out that knife because someone was mad he had just started smoking again , it was definitely an overreaction from him and just a continued power move of him saying \"I do what I want\".\n\nSo really, the oddities with this was that this \"socially challenged loner\" knife guy (that was literally constantly putting himself and other in physical danger) was being defended, and even though there were others trying to stop him and help him get through his issues that were causing this; my character became the scapegoat. Even blamed for the knife guy's bad behavior \" \\[She\\] is the one that managed to drive him away again.\" The extra odd thing that made me think \"Wait, this might be like a psychological/sociological thing here,\" was that no one ever tried to help my character. Knife guy acted up, got attention, got attempts to fix their problems. My character never tried to lay her problems on anyone else, so I think everyone though she was perfectly healthy.\n\nIn short though, calling someone out in person just made them leave the game. Guy who protected knife guy left shortly after we called him out. The same happened to the happy thief guy. We finally called him out on that same behavior as it was almost like he had to take over the job once the other guy left (strange too, because he was the other guy who tried to physically remove the knife from knife guy, yet was now saying that my character was just using force and intimidation to solve problems). But I think you are so right that part of this was just that it was normalized enough that it was probably easy to jump on. I honestly would have thought I was crazy if that one player (wolf zen master) hadn't constantly reassured me I wasn't.\n\nI kept playing for many reasons, by the way. First off, the storyteller was a friend. Second was that this character grew on me. I had never attempted to explore this issue in a game, and she really connected with me, and seeing these odd reactions in and out of character was a little enlightening to me. I'll go in more about that with the other commenter, but thank you for poking some more at it. This reflection on what happened is actually pretty awesome in a lot of ways.",

            "body": "You thought the exact thing I did. The more time went on with their behavior, the more I realized they weren't just attacking my character, they were attacking me through my character. I was abused growing up too, and you are not paranoid. When I actually started to call them out on their behavior, I told them that some actions seemed more against me, not my character. They just straight up denied it. Yet, definitely have some evidence to the fact that other players characters could do similar actions, but only my character would get called out for injustice. \n\nThere is more details in previous comments, but there was a vote in character between a dangerous but definitely would fix issue solutions and a safe but might break things and be a trap solution. One character demanded and refused to talk further, which is why we voted. When the vote was the solution opposite that character's choice.. that's when they seemed to start acting up. Including a \"If this fails or someone gets hurt I'll never forgive you\" (Again directly to my character, not anyone else who voted to go) They later said they were mad \"my character\" was taking choice away from them, though honestly that sounds OOC (Again, ME not the other players that voted to go) After that, they started to tell the Knife Guy \"lying is okay, you do what you want,\" basically encouraging our socially challenged loner to further agitated everyone else.\n\nThe final straw that made me confront them (and then of course, as with the pattern they left shortly after) was when they decided to handle a spiritual issue, instead of our.. well spiritual issue resolver character. Now, I think most agree the biggest mistake is to go too far in either spectrum of that. A big mistake in role playing game with stats and dice to roll is that only the best at something should handle the issue. However this was both taking away from the other character's in character societal role, and no one actually did stop them from handling it. I had actually just made a minor comment ooc that \" I think \\[my character\\] was almost going to stop you, since it really should have been handled by our \\[Spiritual issue resolve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nr\\].\" and their response was \"Oh, I'm glad \\[she\\] didn't. If she did that, I would have left the game.\" Which red flag me, because she worded it \"If you character does something, I will do something out of character\". I will also add that earlier they had asked my character to temporarily step down as leader to let the\n\nI guess, like you had said, I think that this was something those players thought was appropriate. If they have an issue with a player, they don't talk to the player about their issues. Instead, they act out the frustration through their characters against the other player's characters. I think they feel they have a safety wall that way, as most of them definitely said \"It's how my character would act\". Like it's a protection against their bad actions and they don't fully control their character. Perhaps it's less that that an abused character would draw people to abuse her, but that they wanted to punish me through my character and knew that the abuse was the best way to get a reaction out of her.",

The hobby attracts all sorts, including abusive monsters who use roleplaying to fulfill their power fantasies.\n\nI also understand that completely normal people may try exploring playing a monster of a character, but my experience has been too much of the former.  Especially reading OPs comments going deeper into things, it could be that, or the others were talking smack OOC and ganging up on their character IC, that happens a lot too.",
