            "body": "&gt;They frequently cancel what few plans they do make with me in favor of a more insular experience with only a handful of people.\n\nThis was my experience in the only group RP I ever did.  And I tried REALLY HARD to get to know people and insert myself into the ongoing storylines, but people there hated including outsiders, and they hated scheduling or pre-planning even more.\n\nI gave up after about a month.  I think that for the most part, a person's behavior doesn't change, and if you keep doing the same thing hoping for a different result you're gonna be disappointed.  Seek RPs with people who act like they actually want to be there and aren't just falling back on you because their favorites are busy.",

Let them understand their problem (Hey, you're not communicating until the last second, and it caused me issues) and then let them know it's hit a limit (If you keep canceling last minutes and not communicating with me, I'll have to assume I'm not worth your time). You'll be surprised how much just changing your reaction to their behavior will either make or break them. Sometimes they just didn't realize how much it effecting other people. Definitely drop them if they keep doing it after setting a boundary though, as that's them deciding it for you.",
