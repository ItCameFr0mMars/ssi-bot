            "body": "Aw man I feel for you. Running a group RP site can be challenging. A lot of people like to lean on admins and moderators to really get the ball rolling for their new characters. I\u2019ve run a forum for a while now, and getting people involved was and is something I struggle with. \n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve done in the past is a \u201cpost roulette\u201d you sign up whatever characters you want and everyone\u2019s name goes into a big pot. After signups, I gave out two (or three) names, a location, and a basic problem.  The problem can be as simple or complicated as you like, and I\u2019ve used simple writing prompts for it in the past. You can tell people who is going first or let them work it out themselves, but it can create some great opportunities for people to meet others and see other cool OCs. It can also serve to give you a bit of a breather. \n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t let yourself become so bogged down you burn out completely. Your mental health is important and the burden of new plots shouldn\u2019t always fall onto you.",

            "body": "I think that\u2019s what ruined most of my Roleplays on Discord. \n\nMost of the groups I joined had a text-channel for causal interactions, but after a while, it became the heart of the RP.  Usually people interpreted them as actual Texts, so the characters didn\u2019t even interact in person. In the worst cases, the plot was replaced by characters simply \u2018announcing\u2019 they had done something off-screen to gauge a reaction. Random things, too. Nothing else happened. People just went \u201coh no, I dropped my lasagna\u201d and it was never mentioned again. \n\nI used to RP with the same people for a while (we made several groups) because a friend invited me, and I think the moment I lost my patience was when we had a Historical RP with no technology, but people still acted as if their characters were texting, making it very clear the characters weren\u2019t even in the same room or sometime, realm.\n\nThe rare face-to-face meeting were awkward, too. My favorite anecdote: someone\u201cforgot\u201dtheir OC wasn\u2019t a chatting and replied with a cat meme to a verbal conversation. They had just been accused of theft and were (in theory)in danger.",

Our issue was people were _abusing_ them; not only did they rarely interact outside of them, but they often used them simply to make their OC look cool or sad without any risk.\n\nWhen I said they just \u201cannounced\u201d things, I meant literally. Rather than interacting with other characters, some OCs just visited the chat to give updates hoping to earn a shocked reaction or sympathy. The issue was those events were never mentioned again.\n\nTo give you a practical example, a character once informed the group he had brutally killed someone. That was supposed to have an impact on the plot, but since it happened off-screen, no one could intervene. The next day, people forgot about it, and he acted as if nothing had happened. \n\nAs a result our characters never built solid relationships and rarely interacted with each other. It was a bit of shame, really.\n\nMm, I see. It sounds like they forget the original theme. Was it fun while it lasted, at least?",
