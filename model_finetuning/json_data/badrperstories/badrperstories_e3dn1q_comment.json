I remember I had a thief character who was cold, stoic and didn't care about anyone - that was two years ago, and we do not talk about her old self - and so, she got into the rp.\n \n Chapter 1? The mod character immediately goes to her to make her 'nice' and says that his character has so much charm - they didn't - that anyone listens to them. I just, went along with it due to being a noob but in now, I regret going along and ending up hating my character for it. Frick those types of people tbh.",

            "body": "The most annoying part was that she would always try to guilt me into writing this stuff, for example by insinuating that I was not a good writer if my characters did not change for the better. Or by flat out refusing to write with those characters again (she would just always say that she 'I have no ideas for them' if I asked why she writes with other characters of mine, but not with them). \n\nAnother problem was: she did not only want this for real villains. If a character was a bit of an asshole, rude, or even just lazy and demanding, she would assume that all these negative character traits would completely disappear after a short period of time. Even if he was not even a bad guy, but quite nice in some situations, he had to become completely flawless.\n\nAnd you are right with that. Sometimes I wonder if some people would be better of writing fanfiction because they just need so much control about the story and do not even seem to get that roleplaying should be fun for all of the writers involved in an RP, or that there is an other writer who should also have a say in how the story develops.",

            "body": "I sympathize here, with mostly the idea that people are way too redemption-happy. Because my old RP that I was running had redemptions as part of the story, and that wasn't inherintley supposed to be a good thing.\n\nI ran by \"earn your happy ending\" rules here, especially with the setting, which was supposed to be a dark fantasy universe that brought itself into a WW2-like conflict, just replace that with people living in forests, fantasy races and give them magic guns. Given the conflict I was deriving from, the characters might have a bit of an issue with who the redeemed villain might be, considering they're coming from the regime that built itself around stacking bodies and probably did terrible things to the player character. Imagine the moral conflicts that arise! He might be good now, but he can't escape his crimes! She's on our side now, but does this really help us in the end?\n\nNope. Ships.\n\nPeople liked to be like \"oh wow I can't wait until I redeem them\" or \"I'm gonna fix them\". Encounters started turning into shouting matches in between gunfire of the heroes trying to yell the villains out of their moral position by magic power of persuasion. Gee, I bet your grandpa used that trick a lot in the war too.\n\nLike yeah, the less flat villains that I put out may have the potential for joining your side or attesting for their crimes, but in the end, they're still the terrible necromancer forest Nazis you're shooting and slicing at. They aren't going to be easy to deal with or fall over all obedient for you. Especially with your character trying to get in their pants all the time. It was worse for the players on the side of the bad guys, who would straight up have pleasant bar chats with the enemy because they were more concerned with muh feelings rather than THE WAR. I couldn't do much about it because I didn't want to be \"that gm\".\n\nDied out, gonna try to do this setting again but maybe change a few methods in GMing and setting up NPCs so the story flows a little better logically and allows for the more dark and desperate narrative I'm going for.",
