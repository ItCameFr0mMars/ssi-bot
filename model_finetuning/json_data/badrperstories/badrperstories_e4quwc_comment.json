Though I am curious about this situation. \n\nSo did you want them to make more characters that would fit into the world? Idk what you usually do to check characters but with the rp servers I go to they usually have some guidelines of what kind of character is allowed or not (I.E banning immortals or characters that are over +1000 years old). Sometimes it has to do with what you present in the rp story itself. \n\nFor example, Is there a \u201cendgoal\u201d for that story? Are there things within the story that OCs can have roles in? Often times if there isn\u2019t a clear goal or particular events going on that can potentially bring the OCs together in one place to interact, people just...do whatever.",
