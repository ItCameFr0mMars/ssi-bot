            "body": " Well said mate. In order to keep roleplaying, one needs to find a proper fandom - or part of the fandom - with people who won't ghost, block, report and badmouth for no reason. If you don't find a group, you are basically stuck in an endless hole you can't climb out from.\n\n I was in a situation like that. I joined a roleplaying part of DR and sadly, few rps in it turned toxic to the point of me hating my character for no reason because everyone was attacking him. If not for me being lonely and having nothing better to do, I would have left and lost an opportunity to meet so many good people - which hapened just two months later.\n\n Hopefully, all of you roleplayers will find your own circle of fellow roleplayers and the like and won't be ghosted, blocked, banned etc \u2764",

            "body": "I've had experiences with both groups and 1:1 RPs, it seems rotten apples can be found in any type of RP and in any fandom group. It gets harder to go out there again and try again, isn't it? The more people are burned, the harder it is to keep the door open. Ghosting especially is the most painful experience I've felt personally.\n\nI've met a few people I can say are very good friends now. And I've grown as a person as well, making me able to detect bad folks better.\n\nHere's what I've learned from 15 years of RP:\n\n- If someone suddenly says \"I'm busy\" a lot or give a load of excuses and never gets back at you, they try to ghost you. Do not feel bad. Being a bit annoying or boring shouldn't warrant a 4-month-long ghosting phase.\n- If someone DOES talk a little with you, but they keep you at arm's length, chances are this person does not want to commit and can be a potential ghoster. Bonus red flag if they mention anything about dropping people on the fly. Do not play this game of cat and mouse, cut your losses.\n- Try not to follow the short attention span of a hyper RP partner. If they make 20 characters and jump to new fandoms weekly, you'll end up drained trying to follow their new interests. Save that energy! It's okay to set up boundaries or part ways civilly.\n- People who never, absolutely never, reach out first are a huge red flag. These people had never thought about me for a moment and are just as happy without me around. Don't let them treat you that way. Even if social anxiety is their reason, you shouldn't get burned for it as a result, especially if they have zero plans for therapy or treatment in the near/far future. Cherish those who take the time and effort reaching out to you, it means you are in their thoughts and they enjoy interacting with you.\n- A lot of people will be unfair. A slight mistake can earn their wrath, a grudge or a permanent block. Though it is always good to work on one's mistakes, very hard punishments are abusive.\n- If someone gossips, don't trust them. They will be talking about you at some point. Don't let them force you to burn bridges with people who might actually be cool and nice, simply because the gossiper didn't really like them.\n- Feel physically ill after interacting with an rp partner? RUN. This toxic person poisoned you with stress and it's taking a toll on your body.\n- Feel ignored in groups? Try being assertive or asking about people's interests or life stuff. If they still ignore you, you've done what you could and it's best to cut your losses. Cliques suck.\n\nDo not get shamed for cutting ties if someone does any of the above. A message saying it won't work out should suffice. Remember: they ghosted first, or they neglected the budding bond. You shouldn't have to carry any stress or anxiety they are causing.",
