            "body": "For me it was quiting roleplaying for six months. Ghost after ghost after ghost...You get the gist. It was disheartening and searching for that one rp soon turned into a chore, that I already knew the end to. Another ghost. So I dropped it all for half a year, and only now got back, found a good rp and I'm having a blast with it. Of course before I found it, I had to go trough ghosts as well, but I had much more will and energy for all this.\nIf I were to give you advice, it would be this: DM people you stoped replying to, and say you're sory and explain the situation, to you know, tie lose ends, get some conclusions and also give it. Then take a break. Say a week or so, and see how you feel about the entire situation.",

            "body": "I had this happen a lot too. Most of the time RP partners are flaky and prone on ditching people. Sometimes it was my fault and a dear friend spoke to me about it.\n\nFrom experience I see RP partners can pick up on our interest/disinterest in threads. Most of the time they don't speak up about it, bottle it up and then call it quits without trying to get the situation fixed.\n\nIt's awful they don't communicate with you. Are you able to ask them how they're enjoying the threads? Are they stuck? Is the thread going places they didn't like or anticipate? What are their moods? Hopefully you find a few who take on that encouragement to speak up before it's too late! \n\nI hope you can get out of your funk to enjoy RP again! :(",
