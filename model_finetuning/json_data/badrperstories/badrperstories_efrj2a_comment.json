            "body": "I've been writing in RP's since 2011 on a site where I'm still friends and have found my fiance on a site kinda of dedicated to writing creative plots like that (It was a Disney Kingdom Keeper site). It's nice to see you continue writing throughout the years as well and you pretty much hit the mark on why there are toxic people in the community. I've came across a couple of them. Sometimes I witnessed people that picked over powered characters, since there's nothing better going on in their lives where it can't be controlled entirely. Though I do noticed, in my past experience, sometimes the bad plots come from kids that are writing in characters like that as well.   \n\n\nOne time there was a preteen. He was the youngest on the site where any interaction he had with a girl, in an RP setting, felt the need to pressure girls to kiss his character and they were to be married within a week's time! Despite what the other writer protests he was extremely persistent. As older writers, we stopped this behavior immediately and told the writer if the other writer said no then no means no. Of course, he mope and post OC to the point of annoyance with him saying, \"MY CHARACTER WILL NEVER FIND LOVE!\" Log off the site and stay offline for a week before doing this all again. Almost everyone on the site was annoyed at his behavior and it seemed to isolate him from joining other RP's because no one wanted to deal with his overbearing characters.   \n\n\nI can't say I am the best writer either it's just writing RP's is a collaborative activity. Something like this situation should never be pushed onto anyone if they don't want to.",

            "body": "I don't really agree with your last paragraph. I do not doubt that there are toxic roleplayers like this, but with many that I have encountered, the problem was rather that they  neglected the 'social' aspects of the roleplay.\n\nDo I expect that people I roleplay with chat with me ooc or become my real life friends? Of course not, but that is not what I mean. With these people, you would always get the feeling that they would expect the same of a roleplay that they would expect from a video game. \n\nA play partner had to be always available, never could they lack motivation or have in real life stuff to care about. If the Bad Rper is online and wants to write, their writing partner better be up for that as well, or they will guilt tripped into writing NOW or insulted. The story is about what THEY want to write, they frequently totally forget that the characters of the other player also have a story to tell, because they assume like in most novel/video games there is a main character, and that it is their character. This character is the one who needs to have lots of love interests/be the subject of a special prophecy/have a super sad back story and everyone has to pity but also admire them.\n\nIf the other player wants to have a story arc focusing on their character and their backstory, the Bad Rper will not put much effort in their writing anymore, because this is boring for them, or even outright reject the possibility of that ever happening. If their play partner mentions some problems with the rp, these will not get solved and no compromise will be found. Instead, they will be insulted, guilt tripped into giving up their ideas or simply ghosted.  These BadRPers will then simply move on to another writer, and repeat their behavior without ever learning from it.\n\nIn the end, roleplaying is a social hobby. But many people do not see that their is another person behind the screen who also wants to have fun and tell a story, they only care about what they want to write and are interested in. This is especially frustrating if these people are the moderators of a group rp.",

At the time she and I wrote an Atlantica RP together, but when her sister was in the hospital the RP stopped. Thankfully, with both of us being in one state and living an hour away from each other I went to go visit her and her family in the children's hospital where I hanged out with them. In hopes of making the younger sister less lonely. We've seen each other outside the RP before this occurred and still see each other in person years beyond the RP's plot. \n\nFor emergencies like this people would think to put aside their wants to attend to what the person needs?

            "body": "My god that sounds heartless for her to not even consider how you were doing or ask why you're in the hospital. How selfish. \n\nYes, the family found a way, and her body seemed to calm down; which is medical mystery. The doctors tested her for type one diabetes and other things (I can't even list out everything she was tested for) and everything came out negative. She had doctors from New York, from the UK, and maybe one from Africa to see if one of the doctors might have an answer for her and the family. Unfortunately, they couldn't help or understand why her body reacted like salt made her faint or drop her blood pressure numbers so low. Since it's been a few years, she is able to eat salt products just fine now. She just can't eat a crazy amount of food products with sodium in it. Even if I visit the family to go hangout with them at Disneyland, the family and I are mindful to bring food that are fruit/vegetable based. It's not a problem at all.   \nThank you. Really I wanted to be there for emotional support.  \n\n\nWhat a horrible person. I can't believe someone would treat another person like this. So did you end up dropping her or how did you end up ditching her? Was the plot of the RP effected?",

            "body": "So, I'm gonna say a few controversial things here:\n\nMost bad RP'ers are attention seekers.\n\nI've been on several servers where people have threatened suicide only to say \"I was stopped by my uncle\" in order to seek attention. I know some that have tried it several times. Are they actual attempts? I don't think so, the last dude said he was too loud during a helium bag attempt and his neighbors broke in. He typed like a retard because \"the helium disabled parts of his brain.\"\n\nThese suicide attempts appear even more frequently on RP servers, especially when activity is too low for them. They make a big deal out of it, posting final notes and such. Not a single one of these attempts was real in my eyes because they weren't arrested or put in a mental institution. They also managed to tell everyone about their \"failed attempt\" the next day. One of these dudes had a real gun which would have been confiscated, but I know he didn't actually try it. He was banned later.\n\nBack to Rp.\n\nRP is an ego-boost for these people. One made a server just for his OC, even making specific art channels just for this OC. They surround themselves in an echo chamber of praise and support, no matter how boring or OP the character is. One person said his character was a \"good god modder\" because he kept reviving my characters (without permission) and switching up the timeline. He then blew up the world as a joke and deleted the server because he \"can't revert it\".\n\nAnyone who makes up a character that's \"AWESOME\" is looking for attention. Sure, some of them are for self-fufillment, but they could just write fanfictions instead. One dude kept parading his OCs that were disturbing to say the least (anthro cars). When told to stop, he threw a shitfit until he got banned. On other servers, he made the cars invincible. They would randomly pop up in the middle of other sessions and kill everyone.\n\nHe almost cried when it seemed like my own OP character (made as a joke) almost killed his Beetle in mutual combat.\n\nIn another session, an admin played along and he asked to be god. He was subsequently turned into a god. I left that server.\n\nNow, keep in mind, these are not good people. They exploit your friendliness, your kindness, everything you have in order for self-fufillment. They will use the deaths of others to step up their attention game.\n\nThese are not good people.",
