It really sucked as he was my fave because he filled a niche that others just didnt and while i was kinda upset at first, once i heard his reasons when i talked to him about it, i accepted it. things changed irl, he had to work and take care of family members among other things. I miss the old days but he has to do what he has to do and im sure he would be as accepting if the roles reversed.\n\nNow in the present the roles have reversed, i no longer rp at all, the hobby became completely ruined to me from just bad partner after bad partner as well as the addition of a job irl and now a kid as well as other hobbies filling the vacuum. I had to stop alot of rps because my circumstances changed as well as my new negative bias. im sure alot of my partners who got the wetwork as a result felt the same way your partner likely will but if its any consolation, the majority of mine didnt make a fuss and were cool about it.",
