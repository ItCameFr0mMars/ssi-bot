But if I would want to apply to a roleplay about a fandom, I need to know certain things, for example:\n\n\\-should the roleplay start at a specific point in the series story? Is it necessary for your play partner to have watched every episode, or is it enough to have basic knowledge and you would be open to write something completely detached from the plot of the original and just use the world/the characters as a basis?\n\n\\-if you are fine with writing AUs, what settings are you interested in (for example university, medieval, crossover with other fandoms) and which are you not interested in. Even if you are really open for everything, I am sure that there must be something you would like to write in particular. \n\n\\-you do not need to think too far ahead, but it might be better to have at least some kind of idea what role your character plays. Is he/she super important for the series plot, more of a minor character, should he be best friends/enemies with someone, all these things  do not require a lot of detailled planning but can help your playpartner envision what writing with your character could be like.\n\nNo full plot is needed, but to be honest with you, if all the information I was given beforehand  is  \"I wish to RP as X kind of character in Y series.\" I  would not be interested in the RP, because it would seem like you are not really creative and I would have to drag your character along and you would not contribute much to the plot",
