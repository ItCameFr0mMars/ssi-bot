A hobby should never compromise or neglect a person's time, education/ job, family, their life, relationships with their loved ones, their happiness, other said responsibilities and priorities outside of roleplay - and most importantly of all - their mental, emotional and physical health. Just because a person isn't busy doesn't mean to say that they have to spend their time roleplaying. You know what? There are things that need to be done, and not everyone is willing to come home after a long and stressful day to open up their messages or begin roleplaying. Why? Because their tired. People are allowed to just take a time out for themselves or to recover from whatever they had to endure that day. It is becoming a joke. You are not\u00a0 (( don't take 'You' personally, I'm using 'You' as a word, not you - as in yourself - but as an example for those inconsiderate pricks )) entitled to someone's time. Just as they are not entitled to yours. People have lives and they don't want to spend it on the internet roleplaying with some stranger. Just because their available doesn't mean they have to roleplay with you. They have a life to live and you are not a priority.\u00a0Roleplay is not a priority and it never should be. If an entitled prick says otherwise they obviously don't understand the concept of having a life, looking after your own wellbeing and happiness - and responsibilities outside of that. It is a joke. People keep complaining that their partner can't respond to them everyday, few days or weeks is pathetic. They are the entitled and inconsiderate party. So whoever's said that to you don't listen. They probably don't have a life outside of the internet.",

I'm struggling to believe that a person who's supposedly working two jobs and is attending High School/ College/ University on top of that can miraculously find the time to roleplay daily, every \u2154 days or week. When you think about it, it doesn't make sense. Does it? However, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, incase they were being legit. My question to them would be this: What does their jobs and education have to do with you responding more frequently?\u00a0\n\nNot everyone wants to come home from a long and stressful day to open up their messages or roleplay. Why? Because their tired. You don't know what that person has had to endure that day, or what they are going through in their life. So yeah. They are allowed to come home and take care of themselves. Their happiness and mental, emotional and physical health is more important than roleplay.\n\nRegardless of how you spend your time it does not mean that the other person can dictate to you, when you respond. They are not a priority. Your life doesn't revolve around them or roleplay. I don't care how they spend their time. They are not entitled to your time. Let them be a whiny immature bitch and leave the roleplay. That's what I would do. You won't lose sleep over a whiny entitled bitch.\u00a0",
