The game isn't your thing and that's totally okay, but your friend deserves someone who really wants to write that story. \n\nPlus, if you're really looking to get to know him better, start some conversation outside of writing.

Maybe consider if you might be experiencing something similar. And if you feel he's had a rough time lately and that doing this is tied into how much you're supporting him through it, that's a huge burden to put on yourself. \n\nMaybe what you really need to hear from him is that it's okay if this doesn't work out, and he knows it isn't because you dont care enough about him to try. It might be helpful to figure out anything else you need to hear from him, to figure out what you need to say\n\nIf you're also feeling burned out it's important to tell him that. Trying to force yourself to have energy for something when that energy just isn't there only makes the burnout worse. You can not power through burnout. \n\nI would ask him to try and help you find ways to make the experience more casual. Maybe set a time or session limit, something really small at first. Maybe even restrict it to a single night.\n\nTry to find ways to emphasize the things you like most, maybe do a bit of homebrew. Or try and mix systems, to tie in a few action sequences with a system you really enjoy. And if it doesn't work out at all, tell him you still want him to play with other people, and tell you all about it. \n\nBest of luck!",

I know that you care about your friend, but if he cares about you he will understand.\n\nIf you're really that worried about it and don't plan on letting him down, I would find a healthy compromise. Maybe meet halfway with the murder mystery theme and include some action elements in it. It doesn't need to be 100% canonical, and you can both be happy with the outcome.\n\nIn my experience, honesty is the best policy. This goes for roleplay partners, as well as any kind of relationship. The truth will come out eventually, and the lies leading up to it will have hurt more then the honesty up front would have.",

            "body": "Communicate your feelings on this to them. No friend will every intentionally make you feel forced into something, so either they're doing it unintentionally or they're not a good friend. Tell them how you feel, and if they guilt trip you or try to pressure you in any way, then you know they're not a good friend. I have very honestly told my friends similar things, and they will most often say things like \"Oh, that's okay! Thank you for letting me know, I definitely don't want you to feel forced into anything.\"\n\nMy clue to friendship is that a friend should always want to do something, and then invite you to come along with them. They should never tell you to come along, so they CAN do something. A difference between, \"Hey I'm going to the movies, want to tag along?\" compared to, \"Hey I want to go to the movies, but I need someone to come with me or I won't go, wanna tag along?\" Sounds innocent, but the second one has more pressure and is unfair to the person you're asking. Not a perfect analogy, but hope you get the point.\n\nGood luck! This is definitely not something easy to deal with.",
