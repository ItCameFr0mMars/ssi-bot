I have had interactions with other roleplayers where the expectations were clearly laid out, but they mostly acted as if I were there to prop up their character and basically generate the world and scenery for them to play in-- which is fine, but definitely not what I put forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enjoy roleplaying with them and you think their main barrier to this is their lack of extra writing, tell them.  Be encouraging, because writing in something that isn't one's native language is daunting.  Assure them that they can try, little by little, because it will make the interaction more rewarding for them, and you can help them with their English skills.  This can extend to even talking out of character and you may make a good friend in the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, if this is just much more effort and energy than you want to put into it, that's fair as well, but respectfully and clearly explain why you want to withdraw.  Don't ghost them.  Thank them for their time and effort, but say it's not working for you.  Best of luck.",
