No, they\u2019re not going to ~instinctively hiss~ if yours holds up a crucifix. And if they bite someone... it\u2019s all in the profile, people! I would be more than happy to make characters that fit the ongoing world for an established universe RP... but this isn\u2019t that. These characters are already defined, and they way their vampirism works is intrinsically tied to their personalities and how they act as characters. I can\u2019t just change major character elements around on a whim.\n\nArgh!",

Or you simply say that they do not need to drink that much blood to survive, and have healing powers which will make sure that their victims don't bleed out.\nIf you do not like that they are powerful, do not give them too powerful abilities, or give the human characters an advantage (for example that they can use certain kinds of magic, and vampires can't). If you think that whole stuff about not being able to go in the sun and being afraid of crosses is stupid, don't include it.\nFor example, I played a vampire character in an rp were it was normal for vampires to not feel any kind of sexual attraction anymore (so no horny assholes), because their way of procreation was basically turning other people into vampires. \nA bad roleplayer will be a bad roleplayer and a horny asshole with every race they play in rp.
