If you can find a partner who roleplays because they love the act of writing in the roleplay itself--these people won't ghost. You find them just by, for lack of a better word, networking in your RP community. \n\nDoes that make any sense?\n\nEDIT: Wait, checking your post history, you're looking for RP very similar to what I do! This is my area of expertise. I can do a full consultation and assessment for you if you like. Send me a PM if interested.",
