So the definition of what counts as 'good' writers for them is often ridiculously small, and entirely subjective. \n\nBut many of them try to pass of this subjective preference as totally objective, and try to put other people down for grammar/writing 'mistakes' that are not really mistakes, instead of saying 'Sorry, your writing style does not fit the flow of the rp' (or something similiar). It would be more honest.\n\nThat said: just because an author is published does not mean everyone considers them a good writer. For example, I would consider the 'House of night' series as something that has a ...well, not very good writing style, but it is a published and even famous book series.  \n\nUsing something like this for proving that they are 'wrong' will achieve nothing, because it can very well be that they found the writing 'choppy' and without a good flow to it, even though others might consider it beautiful prose. Something like that is sooo subjective. I often find books that are praised as the most beautiful writing style ever to be very cheesy, for example.",

I mean maybe your characters are similiar enough (or you really did not include any physical descriptions, but how?) , and it was totally impossible for them to notice. But I found that a bit hard to believe. Could it be that they found the writing too choppy and without a flow because of the missing parts?\n\nMy bad, I am more used to writing samples that are written specifically for the  group you want to join. Most groups I know want those, or writing samples that take place in a world that is easier to understand, but that can be different from group to group. I am more familiar with groups that want the samples to be more like...introduction samples, I understand that samples that are taken directly from rps will always lack context.",
