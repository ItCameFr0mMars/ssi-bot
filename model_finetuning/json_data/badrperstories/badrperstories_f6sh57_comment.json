While people are always a little inconsistent and confusing morally, most people have some sort of moral system. The way that the D&amp;D morality systems work is that lawful = following some greater order or belief or organization\u2019s rules (a kingdom, a church, etc), and chaotic = having any sort of morality that\u2019s NOT based upon a greater system.

As far as free-form type RP goes,  I believe this problem happens when tools like alignment charts are used as character traits in of themselves, rather than labels or *(very loose)* guidelines for a combination of them. Terms like \"Chaotic Good\" or \"Lawful Evil\" *describe* the general attitudinal, moral and ethical leanings of a character; however, these things themselves tend to be complex, a result of interacting elements such as the character's temperament, personality, skills, values and history. This is why these archetypes can't account for nuance or contradictions; they are the *result* of the character, not the character themselves!\n\nIn other words, you can say your character is a Chaotic Neutral in order to give whoever you're describing them to a general idea, but you're supposed to know *the reasons* they're a Chaotic Neutral. Those reasons are what you should be thinking about when writing; not the label. Save the jokes and memes for between the scenes!",
