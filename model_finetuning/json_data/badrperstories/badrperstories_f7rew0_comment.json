This is not your fault, but I don't really see were their reply was rude or anything like that? \n\nIf your writing styles don't align, there is not much more to say to that than don't worry, bye. This is not really trying to guilt trip you, in my opinion, they did not write anything that suggest that they want to force you to write with them or be sad about turning them down. Is it a bit short? Yeah. Was the person probably not happy about being turned down, yes. But their reply is not that bad, in my opinion, many people would not write more than necessary in a situation like that.",
