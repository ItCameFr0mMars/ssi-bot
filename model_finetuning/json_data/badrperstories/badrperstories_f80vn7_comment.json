I had an rp partner who always made rather mean/sassy characters, but as soon another character said 'Hey, that is a little mean' she made up ridiculous explanations why it really wasn't, her character is an angel and the other characters are actually the mean ones (most of the time because of her character's sad backstory which 'forced' her to act this way in her opinion, even if the other characters did not even know it she acted like they should and therefore never say anything to her character that was not praise...)",

Like they're an asshole and as soon as they're called out they try to justify their behavior and blame others. These are negative traits a character can develop out of.\n\nBut if it's the player trying to justify it? Yeah, nah. \n\nAnyway, in my experience of playing asshole characters, it's fun when another character pushes back or calls them out.",
