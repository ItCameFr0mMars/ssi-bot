            "body": "My personal experience with these types of role players have led me to believe this mindset of, \u201cIts not my fault\u201d, has stemmed from people\u2019s inability to disconnect from their character. When you make a character you become connected and dedicated to that character. For most of us, we\u2019re able to disconnect and allow our character to grow when in a role play and allow them to \u2018live their own lives\u2019 per se. However, there are always exceptions and I believe that\u2019s where this issue stems from. In their mind, they\u2019re connected to their character and therefore cannot (or won\u2019t) admit that their character is very much fallible and must take critique in order to develop. This mindset is most prevalent in combat roleplay where they godmod or metagame. That isn\u2019t to say that they do it on purpose, in some cases they might not even realize that they\u2019re doing this and a gentle reminder that no character is perfect will shape them right up. I think it\u2019s just a part of roleplaying that you\u2019re bound to encounter regardless of what genre you right; people just get too attached to their character and aren\u2019t willing to let them fail.",
