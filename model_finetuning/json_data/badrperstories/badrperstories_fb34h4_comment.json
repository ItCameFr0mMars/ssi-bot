But I've also gotten really lucky lately, and found several partners who provide that \"spark\" by being creative, responsive, take the lead when necessary or let me \"steer\" when I've got my own ideas of how things should go. I guess I just wanted to assure you that those partnerships ARE out there. Sometimes you just have to keep looking. Or expressly say what you want.\n\nI've both posted my own ads and responded to others, and it seems about 50/50 as far as success rate with either. Some of it is just plain luck, since you never know who might answer your ad, or whose ad you might be responding to. But I think it's perfectly fair to be picky. If you're just not \"feeling it\" after the initial few exchanges, then bow out. Ask for writing samples, too, so you can judge the quality of their writing ahead of time.\n\nHonestly, I feel like roleplay is a bit like dating. You go on a LOT of bad, mediocre, or underwhelming dates before you find the one that provides that \"oomph\" of excitement. But you'll know it when you find it, and it's SO, SO worth it when you do!\n\nDon't be afraid to be selective. Maybe try posting an ad for exactly what you're looking for (or what you're NOT looking for) and see what happens. And ask for samples ahead of time! In any case, good luck!",
