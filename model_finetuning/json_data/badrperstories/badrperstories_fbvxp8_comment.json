            "body": "Well, it sounds like there are a few things to touch on here. Obviously I\u2019m not there for every conversation you\u2019ve experienced so take everything I\u2019m about to say with a grain of salt but please try considering all of this from another perspective. \n\nIt certainly can feel like there\u2019s some extreme entitlement within the roleplaying community but tone can be difficult to convey over text. You wrote that you had an issue with their behavior when compared to your own. When you rub the other person the wrong way isn\u2019t it possible that on their end they saw whatever statement that was made to be more insulting and demeaning than you had meant for it too? At the same time, the way they respond to you could be happening the exact same way. Something they wrote to you could feel disrespectful even though that was never the goal. \n\nFor example, about a year ago I wrote a post looking for a partner. Looking for someone to join me in a tale of the duel between a monster and a hunter or two hunters tracking down monsters. In it, I used a vampire to illustrate some of the concepts I had. One of the first people to message me was a fellow that very clearly had a distaste for vampires. He danced around calling them stupid in every possible way I can imagine. They\u2019re boring and overdone monsters from a bygone era and not worth his time to write against. At least, that\u2019s how it felt to me as I read through his responses. So eventually I just told him that I wasn\u2019t really interested. After all, I gave the option to use other monsters and the vampire was just my example. It didn\u2019t feel great that he devoted all this energy to take away from what I had written without adding anything of his own. This set him off into a slew of insults. The way I interpreted what followed is that he was under the impression that he was adding to the roleplay by fixing a problematic subject. In his mind, he wasn\u2019t attacking my idea but explaining his reasoning to want to change an aspect of it to better suit his own desires. He accused me of degrading him by saying he wasn\u2019t adding anything. A feeling I never meant to give but he had found in my words.\n\nAnd then it happened again. Now, the second person was significantly more polite than the first but they still did just about the same thing. I would propose an idea and they\u2019d shoot it down. Saying that it wasn\u2019t exactly to their taste and would prefer something else. Every once in awhile he\u2019d agree with an idea but never put forward anything of his own. So again I told him that I wasn\u2019t really interested in roleplaying with him but tried to focus on being more polite. Not just because I didn\u2019t want to offend him. I was aware of how frustrated I was feeling coming to this conversation after my experience with the first guy and dealing with a similar issue. I didn\u2019t want that frustration to poison my words. \n\nThis was from my one single post. Now imagine that I had been putting this advertisement up every week for two months. Dreaming of the day that I finally find someone who understands what I\u2019ve written and works to add to it. Dealing with this type of frustration as well as others. Ghosting, lazy writing, people focused on turning the topic to their own personal NSFW JO material. Each case adding to the residue leftover from previous encounters. Now add ten years of similar experiences on top of that. Issues that are problems are now being weighed down by past experiences constantly building and stacking on top of each other. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point. Trying to meet at a middle ground and are met with responses like, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to work out.\u201d This is something I\u2019ve said to people. Maybe a bit hastily to them but not in my eyes. Not because I thought they had bad ideas or because I was only focused on things being the way I expected them to be. It\u2019s because the things they were trying to bring into the story or focus more attention on that made it obvious they had priorities for their role plays that don\u2019t sync well with my own. The best example that I think most people can relate to is romance. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m not a fan of cutesy fluffy romances. Typically I don\u2019t care for a story with romance as the major focus in general. Often, when I talk to people about my own ideas or theirs if feels like romance is in the spotlight. They immediately start talking about the adorable romantic relationship that their character would have with my own. Only planning out how the two would become intertwined as all other plot points fell to the wayside. Maybe I should have been more specific as to what I was looking for but some of them clearly didn\u2019t understand what my plots are meant to be. To me, this all was a serious red flag for what\u2019s to come. People will claim the plot comes first and romance will be secondary but it almost always feels like that statement is false. Maybe they were lying to try and force a partner to start roleplaying with them and not want to waste the effort. Perhaps they were also lying to themselves about what the focus would be. Now, whether or not they meant to be deceitful or even if my assumptions are even true. It sucks working on a story for days or even weeks just to find out that once the romance starts up it becomes the only subject worth writing about. The ideas they sounded so excited about previously are now being completely ignored. Each scene has become a race towards the next time they kiss. Every injury is just an excuse for my character to have to be gentle and sweet during the care of theirs. Bringing up the issue might temporarily fix it but it feels like it always collapses back down into what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to accuse you of anything. I can only speak to my own experiences and the way I perceive them. But it\u2019s easy to view ourselves as the heroes of our own story. Being the innocent victims to our opponent\u2019s oppression. However, in a lot of cases, it\u2019s easy for them to say the exact same thing about their experience with us. After all, we can\u2019t hear their tone of voice, read the expression on their face, see the discomfort in their movements. I wish I could say that all of my actions are justified but the simple fact is. I have no idea if I handle things in the best possible way or if they\u2019re even in a correct manner. I just don\u2019t want to waste not only my time but also theirs. Becoming disinterested in a plot because their priorities are the exact things that bore me. Losing excitement in a story because it feels like they aren\u2019t going to put the same effort I am into it. Expecting to just be the passenger to the story I create alone. \n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have the answer as to get past that feeling of entitlement that rears its ugly head. I\u2019d suggest trying to look at it from a new perspective and consider how things may look to the other person and consider their feelings towards your own actions. Maybe consider giving roleplaying a break. Shake away some of that residue of bad experiences and give yourself a moment to come back without the additional baggage.",
