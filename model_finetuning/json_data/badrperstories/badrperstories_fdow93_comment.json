And the rp in general sounds as if it sucks, with all the hard to get passes and all.\n\nOn the other hand, I do not really understand why you felt to need to bring your problem with this 'kink' up in the group chat. I get the need to vent, but especially in a group that writes nsfw rps, there will always be people who take offence (no matter how obviously racist something is) when someone 'shames' someones kink. \n\nFor example, I really hate anything that has to do with 'non-con' or 'dub-con'. If someone would force that kink on me, I would loose it. The way people often write it with the female characters later enjoying being raped makes my stomach turn, and I find the notion that sexually assaulting someone enough will eventually turn people into willing slaves or even 'sluts' disgusting as well. But I know that a lot of people who write nsfw rps write that stuff too, so I would not bring it up in the group chat because I know that it would end up causing a lot of drama. \n\nIf someone forced this kink on you or if it was so prevalent in the rp that you could not ignore it, I would get your need to bring it up. But I can get that it might seem like you are trying to cause drama and making problems where there are none (if I get it right, nobody in the group even wanted to play that stuff).",
