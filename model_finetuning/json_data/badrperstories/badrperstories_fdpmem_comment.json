I\u2019m definitely not going to hold this against her or anyone who ghosts me. \n\nWe\u2019ve now been RPing daily for a few weeks, and I hope she can stay this time.

I just go on the assumption that whenever that happens it was them, and not me. Might not be true but it gives me peace. Though I\u2019ve honestly had more partners un-ghost than stay ghosted.
