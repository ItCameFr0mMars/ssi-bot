I know I couldn't RP for the longest time when I was in a bad place. Do NOT try to force yourself to RP if you're depressed. You'll only make the situation worst. Best you can do is seek out a medical professional in that case.",

            "body": "It might be a good idea to take a break from RP. Maybe just for a week or so! Let your brain refresh.  \n\n\nAs for your partner, it's possible your styles no longer mesh. You mentioned you tried to improve your style, and that their posts consist just a short sentence sometimes. It may be that you now need a little more detail to hold your interest, whereas they're still more fond of quick, less descriptive posts.  \n\n\nIt doesn't mean either of you are doing anything \"wrong;\" just that the current status quo is not working. You don't need to offer criticism, per se. You could say something like, \"Hey, lately I've been wanting to do something with novella posts. Would you want to try that with me?\"  \n\n\nThey might say no, in which case you can still take a break. You can also put your RP with this person on a hiatus. I doubt an RP that is not fulfilling to you is fulfilling to them, and it's always best to be honest and not force yourself to put in the effort when you're not having fun. RP is just a hobby. They can likely find the type of RP they enjoy in many places; there are a million Discord servers out there with short, rapid-fire posts.  \n\n\nForcing yourself to participate when you know you'll quickly lose interest is probably contributing to the burn out. Take a breather and try something new. Communicate with your partner and let them know what you want, or you'll just continue to be disappointed. Good luck!",
