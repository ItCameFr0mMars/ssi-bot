            "body": "First of all, I personally don't think you ate the a-hole here, as I find your concerns quite reasonable and understand how frustrated you feel. \n\nI usually try mend things like that, but from what you explained that was not working, so my suggestion would be to gather all the players who are equally frustrated about this and just ignore Host X, as in avoiding to rp with them, and maybe create a separate little server. \n\nIf that doesn't suit you, which is fine, try maybe bringing the issue up IRL with them (if you know them IRL) and maybe talks face to face. \n\nEither way though, I suggest refusing to rp with them in any way until they (try to) understand why you and others are so highly displeased by their actions. \n\nSince you mentioned and admin, who, from the context given, doesn't belong to your friend group, talks to them, again. This time though try to make clear how many players had/have been irritated/angered/whatever by Host X, as the admins (if not underlings of Host X) and the server owner are the people who should take care of these things as well, and if someone continues to break the rules, kick and finally ban them. \n\nI hope I could help you, since behaviour like that would be highly... Annoying. At least. \n\n\ud83d\udc4b",

The characters are not their own people, so I find the excuse that he can not be held accountable for his characters words stupid, because he invented these words for them and if these words and actions don't fit the characters personality, you have every right to complain about it.\n\n A host who has his own NPCs as the strongest characters in an rp is in my opinion not a very good host. If you can't deal much damage at all and the fight could be won without any of the player characters, why include them at all? \n\nIt is an unfair fix to try to force the rp in the direction he wants it to go... For me it seems like host X is probably not very creative, and when a character does not fit his mind-image of where a story should lead, he tries to make sure their powers do not have much of an effect. I have known many players like this. \n\nHe will probably not change his ways anymore, because in the end, he seems to get what he wants. This player seems to think that if he pushes something hard enough, it will have to happen eventually, and unfortunately, this was true for your previous encounters. \n\nWhy should he apologize, in his opinion, he did what he really wanted, and he got what he wanted out of it, for him, everything went well. \n\nNo, you are not the asshole. At all. You should continue to remind everyone of the problems with this player. I would make sure that he knows that breaking the rules is not allowed.\n\n Not this time, not even when it is him, never. For this, you would need a strong moderator. Make the rules more strict, if you are allowed to do that, and very clear, so that he can't weasle his way out of them. If all of you always complain, but there are no consequences at all for him, he will continue to ignore your complaints.",
