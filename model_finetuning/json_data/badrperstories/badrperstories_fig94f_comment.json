The only middle ground I see you guys having is to do something that's more Batman-Joker related. Also have the other person not focus too much on comedy when you guys are having a serious moment in the RP. Side stories within the overall RP story can be good as well.",

            "body": "I get what you mean. But that is, unfortunately, not the problem. Sorry if it came off like that. In fact, we never even really got to the darker parts of the rp.\n I love funny moments. A strict/evil character who is insulted by the only person he can do nothing against and has to hide how displeased he is, a naive character who travels the world and gets into all kinds of shenanigans, character relationships that include characters constantly mocking each other, I love all of that. We always have scenes like this with characters were it fits, for example if humans are together with humans (not humans with monsters).\nThe problem is that she wants this funny stuff whether it fits the characters or not. If my character is reliable for example, I do not want to write him unreliable because that 'would be funnier for the scene', because it would be a different character (and I want to play my own characters in character). It is hard to always invent reasons why this monster, that has always attacked anyone suddenly is okay with being mocked by her characters and just gives them a slap on the wrist. \nIt is also hard to see her character calling an ill and depressed character a 'junkie' to his face as anything other than mean-spirited, and if her character is supposed to be nice and empathetic, I feel the need to tell her that her character does not come of like this.\nI would also be open for side stories. The problem is more like...I want to play my characters at least a little bit how they are, personality-wise.",

            "body": "It's alright on how you can back to me. You're more angry at the situation than trying to relax and venting is one of the great ways of letting go of your anger. I think that the other person needs to dial down on how much fun or funny moments they are throwing into the RP. A reason why I gave you the concept of a Joker-Batman relationship is because you can have funny, serious and dark moments all at the same time. Try to balance everything with him on how to do it. I also think that her timing for jokes and shenanigans are off for certain parts of the story. The only thing I can suggest for you guys is to take a small hiatus from it all to relax and to either pick it up from where you guys were last or start over again.",
