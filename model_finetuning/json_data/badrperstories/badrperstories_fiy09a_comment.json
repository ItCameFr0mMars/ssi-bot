Said they had sociopathy the moment we went to DMs (started in open server and went private bc open server kept interrupting us.) And from that point on about 60% of the DMs were them talking about being a sociopath unprompted, 20% spamming me with memes, and 20% actual RP. While I do feel bad for them, I am not a therapist! And I never asked or needed to know about one's crippling sociopathy irl. It made me very uncomfortable because if I even tried to be nice and relate bc I also have a mental illness, they'd basically just play the one-upping game instead of just accepting that I was trying to be nice too.\n\nOverall, everybody PLEASE remember to not disclose mental illnesses unless you feel it is somehow relevent to the situation. It can be very uncomfortable for others, even other mentally ill people. Especially if you keep bringing it up unprompted.",

Once I lose respect for someone, I can't write with them.   \n\n\nI've ended a story for similar reasons, but one in particular immediately comes to mind. It was this guy who we'll call \"D\". He was married IRL, so was I. I thought that meant he knew that whatever happened in the RP was not relevant to real life. I also told him up front that I generally don't like smut-writing or ERP, and that I usually prefer to fade scenes to black and just kinda outline the sex without playing it if it needs to happen in a story.   \n\n\nAt one point, **passionate hugging** happened between our characters. I asked to fade the scene. He kept pushing the fade further and further back until they were full on having **passionate hugs** . I was clearly very stressed out as my writing went from fluid to more choppy and awkward. At one point, he started messaging me in DMs while we were writing, asking \"are you hot right now?\" or saying \"I'm so \\[redacted\\]ing \\[synonym for firm\\] right now.\" Imo, it was really inappropriate. I don't want to know about his genitals, and I definitely didn't want to talk to him about mine. Instead, I explained \"actually, I'm feeling really uncomfortable. You KNEW I don't like writing smut, and I feel like you forced me to anyway. Now you're being vulgar and inappropriate with me - knowing full well that I'm married, and btw - is your wife okay with this?\"   \n\n\nI was honestly livid. We faded the scene out. He apologized. I gave him another chance, but not in that server or with that character. He came into my main server and was telling me his character wanted to date mine, and then it came out he was telling my admin and best friend at the time the same thing. We both cold blocked him.",

Cool, everyone is chill as normal, going about their own plots and whatnot for like four months. Everything is running smoothly. \n\nThen the admins announce out of the blue one day that the activity check is in effect again. As in literally any character who hasn't had any posts that month are instantly archived. No forewarning, no window for everyone to catch up, nothing. The funniest part? The admins posted as all their characters prior to the announcement so their characters would be exempt from being archived.\n\nEveryone left.",

            "body": "I can certainly think of a couple of times but there's one in particular that's... well... engraved in my memory. (TLDR in the end)\n\nIt was about 12 years ago. At that time, I was very depressed and I binged my fave childhood shows: Batman: The Animates Series and The New Batman Adventures because it made me forget about my poor mental state.   \nRoleplaying on forums was also an activity I really enjoyed and I thought that linking both would be awesome, cue me joining a Batman RPG forum. One of the available roles was Harley Queen and, as I liked her very much as a character, I immediately took her role.\n\nA member of the forum contacted me privately almost immediately after I joined and signed up as Harley: The Joker. I was a big fan of the character and super happy that the player contacted me. I was quite lonely at the time and the thought of getting a new friend was always appreciated.\n\nWe added each other on Windows Live Messenger (oh the nostalgia) and casually started talking. While we played our characters as a couple on the forum, he guided me a lot on messenger, telling me what to do and giving me what I thought were tips, cautions and advices about the ongoing plot in the forum.   \nHe told me I should avoid taking part in the big plot and focus on smaller sub-plots going on at the same time and, *in fine*, that I should just follow him, because that was my role as his character's girlfriend. While I would agree about the characters' dynamics, I felt that I wasn't really free to explore the forum by myself or reply on other threads than his. He didn't put any strict restrictions however, nor did I really pay attention to it because hey, I was depressed and someone was giving me attention. Plus the roleplay was actually pretty fun.\n\nA few weeks passed, roleplaying went alright and the Joker and me became pals on messenger. I then got in an accident that damaged my foot. I told the story to the Joker and he asked me if I could show him pictures of how it looked like. I took it as him being morbidly curious and sent him a couple of pictures of my purple-coloured foot. He then asked me if he could see it on webcam because he wanted to be able to see it in perspective. And me being my naive self and not questioning any ulterior motives, I showed him my swollen, purple foot on webcam.\n\nI din't pay any mind to it until he wrote to me a few days later apologising for his requests. When I told him I was really confused, he confessed to me that he really, *really* liked feet and found them very *pleasing* to look at (note that I had not a clue what foot fetishists were at the time, so the implications completely went over my head). I thought it was weird but kept playing with him.\n\nOn the forum, an admin started to summarise the big plot so far and I chimed in, saying I wanted to take part of it because it was centred about Poison Ivy gone mad and I thought my character being a friend of hers should take action to help her. Said admin told me I should have taken action much earlier and started to blame the members of the forum for being so uninterested about the main plot. In my defence, I told him what the Joker advised me not to take part of it and started observing how a few other members of the forum, mostly recent members, told the same story, that the Joker contacted them individually and advised them to look at smaller threads and not the main plot. The admin then flipped... against us. He berated us and told us we were putting all the blame on the Joker and that we had no power being newbies compared to him, who'd been a faithful active member for longer than us. \n\nNeedless to say it fuelled my depression further and despite the fun I'd had, I told them I couldn't do this and left the forum. My \"friend\" the Joker didn't contact me after I decided to leave. A few month later, I got introduced to the notion of foot fetishism and got freaked out, understanding the odd behaviour of the Joker.\n\nTLDR: I was depressed and joined a Batman themed forum. Joker contacted me privately and told me not to take part of the main plot. I had fun and became friend with him, turned out he's a foot fetishist and asked me to show him my wounded foot. I was very na\u00efve and didn't get the red flag so I did it. Admins of the forum then blamed the new players not to take part of the main plot and when we all pointed to Joker telling us not to do so, we got blamed instead.",
