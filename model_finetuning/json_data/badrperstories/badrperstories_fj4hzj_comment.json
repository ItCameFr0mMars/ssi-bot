            "body": "Well, the thing is, if you give up searching, you'll *never* find it. Maybe you just need to change how, or even where you search.\n\nI've found a couple of partners here on Reddit, but the age demographic seems to skew younger, and since I'm an old fogey, I've had a little more luck with Barbermonger (I don't know if I'm allowed to include links, but you can Google-search that term plus roleplay and you'll find it), where you can post more in-depth ads and I think the quality of writing is a bit better (not always, but usually).\n\nYou can also try being more specific in your ads. Like, outline exactly what you want and what you're looking for. You might even suggest a plotline to start with -- I know that helps me a lot when I'm browsing roleplay ads. If folks are just like \"I'll roleplay whatever!\" I tend to pass. I like it a lot more when they're detailed about what they want, at least in terms of genre or types of characters they want to play. Then it's easier for me to decide if that's something I'm interested in too. Too much of a \"blank slate\" post makes me think we'll have to brainstorm forever first (with me doing the bulk of it), and so I just move along.\n\nBest of all is when they just post a prompt or starter to get you immersed right off the bat!\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask for roleplay or writing samples first, too. This can give you a better gauge for their quality as a writer and whether or not you want to spend the time pursuing anything.\n\nTry answering ads more often, too. You may be more likely to get someone who's more pro-active in the roleplay, if you're following their lead initially by answering their ad. If their ad is explicit about what they want and what they're looking for, then they may be less likely to be the \"submissive\" type you're hoping to avoid.\n\nIn any case, don't lose hope! It can be daunting, but it's so, *so* worth it when you find a partner you jive well with!",

Thankfully I\u2019ve never been ghosted, and I don\u2019t ghost either. I\u2019ve met cool people where we were able to mutually be like hey! You\u2019re not exactly what I\u2019m looking for, and we just go separate ways no hard feelings. The only immature ending I\u2019ve had to an rp partner was last night, but he was stressed with college so I get it. I am frustrated because I do constantly push myself to talk to new people but everyone of course is so unique, but things happen. Activity is also a thing, well in general there so many factors so I\u2019m ranting and venting now but it\u2019s definitely not like two or three things happened and I\u2019m fed up, it\u2019s a lot of things over based on how I\u2019m feeling in the last five years that came out just now",
