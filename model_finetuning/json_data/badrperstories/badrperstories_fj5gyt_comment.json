            "body": "There are multiple reasons for this:\n\n\\-a lot of times, the members leave roleplaying after a while. In the forum where I started roleplaying in 2012 with about 20 people my age or older, only two of the older roleplayers are still active, the rest focuses on other hobbies now. So most of the roleplayers are still on the young side, and even though older roleplayers exist there, they are a minority and nearly invisible. Many of the older roleplayers quit roleplaying due to the lack of time because of work, family and so on. Or because they now think that it is a childish hobby. So a majority of the 'fanbase' is still very young on many sites, therefore it appears as if there are no/few older roleplayers to them.\n\n\\-if you only roleplay on certain sites and don't know about any other, you might get the idea that there was no roleplaying before these sites (for example Discord) were invented. A lot of children who roleplay will not google the history of roleplay before hand, so it is just normal that they might be surprised to hear that there have been other sites before.\n\n\\- I (personally) know a lot of older roleplayers who refuse to interact with too young roleplayers, because it feels weird for them if they are 40 and write with people who are like 14, even though they do not write ERP. They stay mostly in their own spaces.\n\nSo I get why some younger roleplayers are confused when suddenly, they learn that it is not only a hobby for children and teenagers.",
