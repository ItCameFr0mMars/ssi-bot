            "body": "Dude, I once joined this server that boasted high activity.  \nTurned out it was just like you just described - shitty one-line play, frequent splices of OOC in RP threads. God, it was the WORST.   \n\n\nBut on top of all that, there was also a rule that said when it was your turn to post, you had to post within 15 minutes or you ran the risk of your character being killed off. If I'm inspired, I average at about 20 minutes per post, usually giving 3-5 paragraphs, but I can give a full page in 35 minutes (again, pending inspiration).   \n15 minutes was something I'd not be able to do. When I politely declined and left, the Admin started harassing me before I blocked him. Then he started dragging me in a hub server we were both in, saying crap about how 15 minutes is plenty of time and all this crap.   \n\n\nSure, it can be, especially if most of your server is only giving you one sentence as a post. The issue is - I'm a fucking adult. I cannot just be sitting around all day, checking discord to see if it's my turn.   \n\n\nAs a novella style writer, I'm very active. If I've got nothing but RP happening that day, I can bang out 10-20 replies in a day. It's great. That guy's expectations were bs though. His story never goes anywhere, because his turnover is so high. Every character they get ends up being \"killed off\" within a day. People get frustrated, they leave, new people come in. It's impossible to build a collaborative story that way.",
