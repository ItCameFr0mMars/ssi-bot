(\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\uff89 \nWe haven't heard from you much in a while in the server so I just thought I would reach out to see if you are doing alright ^^\n\nand they responded, apologized and said they\u2019ve just been busy and then sent a response in the rp right away. \n\nAnd then after that the rest of us have kept it moving again and now we\u2019ve pretty much reached a point it is completely impossible to reply anymore to finish the scene because it wouldn\u2019t make sense without the admin\u2019s character to respond. I\u2019m not trying to be impatient because I truly do understand what it\u2019s like being pressured to reply when you can\u2019t or are just not feeling it; but I admit it is still somewhat frustrating and some of the active people are starting to get a little impatient/frustrated too that we can\u2019t keep going.",
