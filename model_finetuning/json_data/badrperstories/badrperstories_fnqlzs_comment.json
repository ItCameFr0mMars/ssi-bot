            "body": "They don't even have any excuses for our RP. First, ours is chat room based, so conversations are everything.  Secondly, we have a main setting where the characters come together.  Then, every few months, the ops will run what we call a \"big plot\" that affects a large area if not the whole of the RP.  For example, one of the last plots we ran last year involved a group of mortals that were hunting down Fae. The Fae then grabbed some of the townspeople, turned them into Fae, and put them in the area the hunters were in. They wanted the mortals to solve their own problem.  Another plot we did once was a power source that used time particles fell through a portal and landed in the middle of the town. It was leaking time particles that caused sections of the town to experience different periods of time (and prior plots). The characters had to go through the sections to collect parts of the device that fell there in order to shut down the free flow of time particles.\n\nSo players can get involved without having to run or write anything other than what their characters do. They can try to solve the plot, help the ones that are directly affected by it, try to stop what's happening, you know several options are available to them.  Mostly they just wait for the op characters to decide what to do and then follow along til the end. It's frustrating.  Then they also have the nerve to complain that the op characters \"get all the glory\" for concluding the plot/situation.\n\nAnd then we encourage the players to run \"personal plots\" that directly affect or involve their characters, or the characters of their friends.  These are few and far between.",

Right now the rp we are doing ( which has been all over the place mind you, which is a long story all on it\u2019s own) we use the -,- for the actions because that is how they rp. Though i\u2019m more of a rper that does not use those, or *,*. Sure i once started using those when i first began but not anymore. Anyway, they do not even contribute to a scene. Like if our characters are arguing ( or at least trying) they only revert to an affectionate action (or they just send -smiles-, over and over ) instead of even continuing the string of dialogue. Like i\u2019m trying to make the rp more interesting but it doesn\u2019t seem to go anywhere because my partner \u2018switches gears\u2019 on whatever convo the characters are having ( argument, discussion ect) and just does only that alone. When i try to add something, it gets tossed out the window. It is not wrong for the rp to have drama/agnst either. But my partner just doesn\u2019t seem to get that. Sorry for my somewhat semi- rant but if you ever need to talk, feel free. I could use some friends. I do apologize for what has happened to you though. As well as many others.",
