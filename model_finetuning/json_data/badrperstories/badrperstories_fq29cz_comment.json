            "body": "Oof, this whole rp sounds...exhausting. But I do not get why it should be a grey situation (except for the ending, but did B really pretend to be dead and spread the rumors themself, or did other characters do that?) For me, this whole situation presents itself like this:\n\n\\-A writes B 11 text messages asking if they want to spend the day with them, B says no and explains why\n\n\\-A does not seem to accept the explanation (it is okay to ask if something is wrong, but it sounds a little bit as if they were pressuring B to give a 'good' explanation to why they want to be alone, even though it is normal to want to be alone sometimes)\n\n\\-B again explains why, and decides to ignore the message A has send them with the meme which is  comprehensible as they have already said that they want to be alone that day\n\n\\-still the same day, A has a mental breakdown and writes B about how much they need them (kind of forcing B to be there for them even though they wanted to be left alone for the day, making them feel guilty for wanting to have their alone time)-&gt; this does sound manipulative and toxic to me, because it puts B in a position where they are the bad guy if they don't neglect their own mental health for A\n\n\\-A has a mental breakdown because of Bs understandable reaction\n\n\\-timeskip\n\n\\-A obviously did not care about B when they put their need for attention before B's need for space, says to B that they do not put enough effort into the friendship\n\n\\-B leaves\n\n\\-A puts the burden of their mental breakdown on B (again), making them feel bad and guilty for their own needs (for space) because they were not their to distract them when A was suicidal (this seems like guilt tripping them to me for a normal reaction, they needed space and A disrespected this)-&gt; B suspects that this emotional manipulation and needs some space, disappears for a while.\n\nI am sorry, but I totally get why B (the character) would react that way and see A as the 'Bad Guy'. I do not know why they player of B decided to write through whole days of alone time, but that is a different problem.",

Should we make a time skip to a point in the rp when B wants to see A again?'\n\nBecause having a character 'demanding' attention by having a mental health crisis is most of the time... a very bad idea. It puts your partner and their character in a situation in which it is very hard to write their character in the way they were originally intended, because there are only three possibilities:\n\na.) they give in and take care of A and forgot about their original plan of not having them meet right now, which seems to go against the character's goal of teaching A be less clingy.\n\nb.) they are the bad guy, because they do not help a friend in need and just ignore them entirely\n\nBoth is probably not what your rp partner wanted, so they want for option c.) and interpreted their mental health crisis as a manipulative tactic, which is understandable.\n\nSee it like this: You write a character who has someone who is way to clingy with them. You write a scene were your character B tells them in uncertain terms that today, they want to be alone for a while. On the same day, the player of the clingy character writes them having a mental breakdown which makes your characters attempts to create a little bit of a healthy distance between them futile. \n\nThis sucks a little bit for the other player (although I find their rp style weird if your characters don't even directly interact and still write the whole day.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHm, I think your last example is a little bit off. Because friends are not a doctor (or in that case, a therapist). They might have their own problem to deal with. \n\nI mean, it is always okay to reach out, but especially if the other person has their own mental health issues to deal with, they might just not be capable to deal with your mental health issues on top of that. Yes, it is always nice to help your friends. But sometimes, you might be overwhelmed by their demands. It is always...risky to say that you can end their suffering (for the moment), and if you are not there for them that means that you let them suffer. Sometimes, people have to find other ways to deal with their mental health problems.",
