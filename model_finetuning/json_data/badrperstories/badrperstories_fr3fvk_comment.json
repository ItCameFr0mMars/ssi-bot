Unfortunately, a lot of my past rp partner glorified similiar toxic behavior of their characters in the past. They just think that it is 'quirky' and cute, because they see this jealousy as a sign of them being truly in love, and they do not understand what kind of strain that would put on someones relationship if their own partner treats their child like garbage.\n\nYour partner seems to acknowledge the fact that a child would be important for your character (if she is excited for him being a protective dad and so on), but she does not get that  him being a good dad would also include protecting her from his jealous partner. She wants the cute/funny scenes of him being a dad, but she does not want it to be realistic.\n\nI knew a lot of people like that, for example they would say stuff like 'Oh, Gregory is such a good friend, he takes so much care of Lee!' but then their love interest character would insult Lee and they got angry when...Gregory really took care of his friends and was not amused by this. People like this often do not see the emotional impact such a tricky situation would have on the character's relationship, they see their character being rude just as a quirky sign of endearment.\n\nI get why you are confused, because I do not really get the logic behind that as well.",
