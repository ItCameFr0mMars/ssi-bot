Elves,  dwarves and the like are cool) unless if you want to be vilified as a monster, or forcibly transformed into a furry to learn the error of their ways. \n\nNot only that but I also used to be a furry who did the same old human=bad animal=good trope but after doing it for so many years and then trying to break away from it only to be forced back into it I\u2019ve pretty much grown sick of them. \n\nI don\u2019t mind RPing with a furry character but the second race starts getting brought up as a plot point thats when I begin to tap out. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d probably hang out on some website or groups more catered to furries. You\u2019d probably get a much better reception over there. That or DnD those guys always seem to have a lot more positive reaction to furry characters.",

For those people theirs no need to be rude and flip out at the mention of a non-human character but it might help to put up an ad or add your own tag to also give them a heads up in what your interested in playing in. \n\nAnd of course I agree with ya. Bring up race shouldn\u2019t be a problem but I think that kind of story should be addressed and planed out prior to RP so people know what to expect and what their getting into. \nFor me I\u2019d more interested in the cultural and political sides of it rather then overusing hate based on appearance. Unfortunately for me that\u2019s been the bulk of the plot points so I just automatically tend to shy away from it. \n\nLike for my own characters they live in a melting pot surrounded races bigger and tougher then them so they wouldn\u2019t shy away from the monstrous looking ones. Instead they\u2019d be more inclined to avoid the races that are known to be openly hostile and/or specifically have beef with them for any other reason. \n\nSorry about your experiences DnD though. I haven\u2019t had that issue but maybe that just has to do with already being placed in a niche with furries so I tend to find them easier? What about fur affinity though?",

But that is more of a 'some furry role players give everyone a bad name' problem, because in a lot of group rps, a furry character seemed to automatically mean  that I would have to see detailed art of the character having anal sex or engaging in kinks/ detailed descriptions of the characters giant cock/ weird concepts like 'breeding periods' in which the female characters would try to fuck every male character who is around...so if someone wants to play a Furry in one of my rps, I always fear that my characters will be forced into sexual situations. \n\nNormally, I just say 'Yeah you can, but I do not write sex scenes' and they will go away. But if I see a furry character in group rp, I often think 'Oof, I hope he/she isn't one of those guys.'\n\nWhich is a shame, really. Because I love to write and write with non-human characters, I like lizard people and all that stuff, I would even be open to play with people who write animals with almost no human traits. \n\nWith species similiar werewolfs, I think many people  want their character to fuck/romance the human form, and the 'muscular, dominant wolf form' is just there to make it more aggressive/dangerous, so the characters can have endless conversations like 'You know that I am not good for you, I am a monster' and so on.",

Believe me, they'll get down with the beast. \n\nWhat I think it is? They don't wanna admit they're into that. They see how much hate furries get on the internet and go \"I ain't want nothing to do with that\" but turn around and wind up doing some roleplay, finding the \"acceptable\" loopholes. Werewolves are those acceptable loopholes, people just ain't willing to admit it, cause you draw attention to the loophole, people start to tighten it :P",

But I always wait for the final concept to see whether my concern is justified or not. \n\nMost of the time, you do see quite quickly were this is going, but I also knew furry players who showed me art for their character that was something the 'wrong' kind of furry typically uses, but then they said 'Oh, and I do not play sexual scenes at all' (and everything was fine in the rp).\n\n And the other way around, planing a whole rp with a furry character, not noticing anything off and then suddenly, in the middle of the rp: weird kinks. There is always the type of roleplayer that hides their true kinks because they know that if we write the rp for a longer time and I am already in love with it, I will probably not cancel it even though I am uncomfortable...\n\nI think a lot of people just do not know why there is hate for furries at all, they just go with the flow. I noticed the same thing when Twilight was unpopular with vampire rps. Everyone had a part in their search that stated something like 'But I would never write anything like Twilight' / 'not looking for sparkly vampires like those in Twilight'. But if you took a closer look at what they wanted to write...it was almost exactly like Twilight. They were just ashamed that they enjoyed stuff like that, because in 'true vampire rp communities' Twilight was looked down upon.",

The Furries who go to the extreme end of the fandom.\n\nLike, if we were to be completely real here, there isn't a fandom on this planet that isn't permeated with oversexualization. It just so happens that furries are one of those broadband fandoms you know? It's so generic that most people will wind up in it. Lion King Fandom? Furry. Disney Robinhood? Furry. Zootopia? Furry. Those are the first three to come to my mind, and a big reason the furry fandom is what it is is likely because of disney TBH :P And Disney movies are ***filled*** with sexual subliminal messages. Not only that, but most of the people in these fandoms are horny teens. Horny adults. Horny people in general. Last I checked, like, 99.9% of the human population liked sex, and this is why you get so much of it.  \n\n\nFor your twilight analogy, I can more or less sum up why Twilight got a terrible review by most of the internet. Because it was a bad story, with cardboard cut out characters, and the entire thing was a self insert. Becca was designed to be as generic as possible to allow the most girls to identify with her, so they could live in this fantasy where they are the center of two stupidly attractive supernatural boys who are both pining over her. People hated Twilight because they were battling against the fact that this trash story made it super big and over took the Vampire/Werewolf scene by storm. The world is boring, the characters are boring, and yet it was hugely popular because the maximum amount of people could identify with it, and that's why people both loved it and despised it so much. There usually wasn't an in between.",
