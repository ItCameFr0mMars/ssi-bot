I remember interacting with a blind character before, and I found it to be a wonderful opportunity to play up all the OTHER senses. Like what she'd hear, textures she'd feel, the change in the air if someone moved close by, fragrances, etc. I thought it was a really cool way to stretch my writing skills and focus on everything BUT vision (although I still included that too).\n\nIt's still fun to do that sort of thing if, say, a character is blindfolded or it's dark in the room or something. Just a cool way to make the experience more immersive.",
