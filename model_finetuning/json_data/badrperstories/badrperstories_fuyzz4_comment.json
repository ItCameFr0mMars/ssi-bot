IT was so far unlike them, and the answer was \"Because I said so\"\n\nLike, I have a knack for learning peoples characters. You play with a well written character long enough you learn that character. You learn their motivations, you learn their short and long term goals, you learn their humor. You gradually start to learn everything about them, because it's impossible not too if you're paying your partner enough attention. Just how long it takes varies.\n\nYou can learn someones character. You can learn someones character well enough that if someone does something that is out of line for the character, you feel it. It causes you to go \"Why?\" and at least I hope you have a good reason for it. Why did the character you have played as a pacifist this entire time who doesn't know how to use a gun, suddenly pick up a gun and go Gun Gale on like 40 people killing all of them with no remourse? Oh, because you said so? Fantastic.\n\nLike, you can treat a well written character like anyone else, and you can inordinately tell when someone does something extraordinarily out of character. You can tell when your favorite character in your favorite show or movie does something out of character. And when it happens, it's either explained really well, or called out for ruining the character. \n\nThat's just my thoughts though.",

IMO, most just end up as carbon copies of Yuno Gasai. \n\n- OCs who frequently take quotes from other characters as if said quotes were just normal dialogues for them. \n\n- Players who cant do a proper response if faced with a negative consequence from their actions.\n\n- Dodgelords. \n\n- Players who suddenly say that their OC is \"immune to this\", \"unaffected by that\" during a battle scene. Bonus points if said immunity was the exact same power your OC has.\n\n- Over-the-top, flashy fight scenes. A little bit of flashiness is okay, but too much just hurts. Bonus points if the fight scene is something like you see in anime. \n\n- I have yet to see another player who does this but... Players that make their OCs surrender or faint during a battle scene when they feel they are losing. I think its mostly because they dont wanna see their OCs recieving the decisive blow.",

            "body": "Here's some of mine (from experience) \n\n- Characters that exist purely for romance purposes. They bring nothing to the story and basically serve no purpose other than arm candy to someone else's character (usually the character is the person's SO) \n\n- Baseless romance/smut. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer it when things have MEANING behind them. Yes, you can just \"hook up\" with someone but when there's no discernable reason to get all hot and bothered or in a relationship that bothers me to no end. \n\n- Constant \"My character is x\". Seriously, we get it; you like your character. That's good, and I'm not saying you shouldn't but for the love of god talk about something else. \n\n- Hybrids and Homebrew characters. This is just bad experience on my part and I'll be honest about that. I've dealt with a Turian x human hybrid (mass effect) who, in addition to having massive breasts - something Turians don't have - also had two seperate digestive systems thanks to the lore. The person behind that character was, and Is, a complete weirdo and I'm glad I don't have to deal with them any longer but God was it hard to deal with. \n\n- People who can't seperate themselves from their characters. Getting hurt over something a character did or didn't do or making a big deal out of something when it doesn't go in the way that's overly beneficial to your character is... childish. \n\n- Acting like your character is hot shit when they've got nothing to show for it. \n\n- Advancing your characters abilities too quickly or without significant steps of improvement. \n\n- Constantly trying to get your character to be better than everyone else like it's some contest on who is better than who. A balanced group, in my opinion, should consist of a set of characters that each bring something to the table.",
