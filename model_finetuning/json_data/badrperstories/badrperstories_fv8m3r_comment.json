            "body": "Speaking as someone who has been the victim of shaming, shit talking, and otherwise toxicity by certain RP groups over the years, all I can say is that its hard to learn to trust people again. I recently cut ties with someone I have known for **ten years** due to their continued close association with a certain player, whose the leader of an RP group that I and others fell out with, who told me to \"go die in a greasefire\" with me and all my other friends. Along with a lot of other bad shit.\n\nEven now I've done my best to cut all ties. I removed one of my oldest friends because I couldn't trust her. Eight months ago I had cut off another friend I had known since 2011. Both were once two of my closest friends but I realized that neither of them cared enough about me to even talk to me about the issue between me and their close associate that they wrote smut with.\n\nYou have to surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you. People who want only the best for you. Some people allow others in OOCly and a friendship can be born. Others I've known keep it professional and make it strictly about the roleplays.\n\nEither way works honestly. There's a risk with trying to establish friendships or online relationships. Letting people in is dangerous and they can hurt you. But having a friendship also means you have a deeper connection with another writer and you want to either do specific plots/world build/or just have fun in general.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping it professional and making it just about the roleplay is also good in and of itself. You get to make it just about the writing and plots you want to run and do. And you don't have to worry about the emotional baggage that comes if things flip and drama happens with other writers.\n\nI'm sorry that this happened to you. Losing the will to write is a terrible thing. They stole something from you and it's hard to find it again. All I can say is that not every RP group out there is like that. It's about finding the good people who are care free and don't bring you or others down.",

            "body": "Sounds like a guy I banned from the forum I used to admin. When I became an admin, there were a few anonymous reports about the guy asking for photographs of character references, micromanaging the plotlines, etc. \n\nThe photographs weren't initially an issue we looked into, because it was primarily a My Little Pony rp forum, but strong-arming anyone is just a dick move, period. \n\nMy friend/senior admin gives the typical \"hey, we've had some complaints\" warning PM, while I go into the threads he's been posting in, to get references and timestamps for the paperwork.\n\n I notice that he's set himself up as controller of several puppet characters that are all in the same RP, and was pressuring other characters into borderline softcore, which, being a site based around a show for children, but intended for adults, was unacceptable in the sense of us having underage players. \n\nI continue to document these instances, as I knew that it would eventually cross the line, and my patience pays off: OOC flirting with a 13 year old. \n\nBy this time, I've copied three pages worth of material that was bending the rules so much that the recoil would have had an audible sound when they broke, because I wanted enough evidence to perma-ban this guy's IP, and submit everything to my friend. \n\nWithin the first half page, the ban-hammer strikes home, taking out multiple accounts, around 17-ish (the site's been down for about seven years, and I left before it lost funding, so that detail is a bit fuzzy)",

Can't write with other males, but he can write with any female he chooses. Single ship only, yet he... Well... You know.\n\nHe was incredibly mad if you recall that my character shipped with another. He claimed his character \"will never be a shipped character\" (mainly because he writes smut with everyone on that account, but he said it was because he could only really see him with my character yadda yadda). Yet he goes ahead and... As soon as the drama happens, ships his unshippable character with someone else. While Still writing smut with others, saying behind the girls back how he regrets shipping with her character but \"doesn't wanna hurt her feelings\"... It was a line he used often, and something the girls and I talked about too. \n\nI thought it was pathetic. I wasn't even mad. I just felt bad for the girl.",
