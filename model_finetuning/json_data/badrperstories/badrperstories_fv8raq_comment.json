Or if you have a character who acts super nice, but is secretly having bad thoughts about someone which he never shows to them. \n\nKind of depends on the books you read, I guess.

If there isn\u2019t a setting change, an instance of major character development, a new development to an ongoing plot, or a new character, there\u2019s rarely reason for some of the novels people pump out. But, it is very rewarding when it isn\u2019t forced. I remember I wanted to match someone else\u2019s post length, average of 5-10 paras, when before I was doing 2-3, and it was soooooo much fun. I felt comfortable dipping down to 4, but never felt it was unnecessary to write 6. \n\nLately I\u2019ve only shortened because i don\u2019t have a partner I feel good with at that length.

It is interesting to know what the other person's character is thinking, and though it is put down to text, it isn't as if the other character knows (unless somebody is godmoding or metagaming, but then that is another issue entirely.) For me it is a part of character development, a piece of the story, and explains why my character might be doing what they are, or what they might do in the future.  Maybe it describes their internal struggle while they try to put on a happy or strong facade.\n\nI know others like myself, and I know those who prefer to never write a single thought down, ever.  Nothing is wrong with either style, and I do not think there is a way roleplay *should* be done. It is just a clash of preferences.  Mine also convey how they feel through their actions, but I feel like a post without delving into the mind of the character is somehow lacking (in my own writing.) I am not only writing for the other person, but for myself as well.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks.  But your use of how a roleplay *should* be kind of struck a chord in me, because I feel that is gatekeeping a hobby we all enjoy and slicing off a large group of people who think otherwise. Some people see it as a game, some as co-writing a story with another, others a way to live their fantasies, etc. I do not believe there is a right or wrong way to roleplay, it is just a matter of finding a partner or more who are seeking what you are as well.",
