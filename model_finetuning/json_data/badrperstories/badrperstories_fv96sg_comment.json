Or just stop thinking about it. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re trying to start an rp, I always want to get going as fast as possible instead of letting plots grow and settle in our brains for a bit. Your friend just wants to get it rolling, and saying only what you don\u2019t want makes it so they have to 100% have to come up with it, which isn\u2019t fun. I had to do that a lot and people would eventually resent me for it, I think because I was trying to start RPs quickly and no one ever had ideas WHEN I needed them to have ideas. Which isn\u2019t how that should work. \n\nSo, I\u2019d suggest maybe just trying to talk about plotting. Let them know you\u2019re creatively drained, but want to be as helpful as you can. They might be understanding to that.",
