            "body": "I once wrote an alien species that I was very clear was meant to be a morally charged species. I built them because I wanted people to have a villain that there was no real moral hangup in killing, but at the same time, you could write interesting stories with. I was very effective in that pursuit. Part of their \"Charm\" was that they were as barbaric and savage as they were technologically advanced, so they still participated openly in horrific practices that we would not condone at all, which was the point. One of which was their habit of non-conning each other. One of their moral beliefs was if you do or do not want something, but aren't willing to die over it, you clearly weren't that passionate about it in the first place.\n\nThis is wrong. I acknowledge this, I know it, and I would always state openly that I don't condone said actions, and that the thoughts and opinions of a species I made to *be* evil were not in line with my own.\n\nDidn't stop them from labeling me a rapist, specifically because of my species. People are dumb, and don't get that the best writers have the ability to write convincingly, characters that are unlike them. To write things that they are vehemently against in some cases. Imagine how boring fictional WWII stories would be, if the writer wasn't capable of writing a convincing Nazi? Does writing a convincing Nazi make you a Nazi? Does writing a convincing murderer make you a murderer? Does writing a convincing rapist make you a rapist?\n\nNo, they don't. But people believe it does. We live in a world were people actually tried advocating that if you have no problems playing on the German Team in Call of Duty, then you were a Nazi. It's a sad world to live in.  \n\n\nAs a note, yes, I abide by trigger warnings and never expected anyone to write anything they didn't want to write. There is no fun in writing when one party feels uncomfortable.",
