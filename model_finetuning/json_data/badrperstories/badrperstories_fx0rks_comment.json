            "body": "Woah. \n\nWell yes I do have multiple roleplay relationships on Discord and other social media apps, I tell myself that they will leave one day so I dont get too attached. I do also have created multiple accounts their targeted for certain anime or show such as Soul Eater. \n\nI've seen people like Foster before. In fact in the fast I met someone name hmmm I'll call him Zane. So Zane message me with a bunch of broken hearts and asking me to talk to his ex girlfriend. At first I felt sympathy for him cause that's how I am so I talked to his ex. His ex told me how Zane was mistreating her so that ended there. \nSoon enough, Zane got a new girlfriend and he kept harassing her and bulling her to the point that he created a group chat with me to scream and bully at his girlfriend to leave and die. All she did was to break up with Zane and he started to cry his eyes out. He then kept adding people in and people were kicking people out and leaving! \nEveryone was livid with Zane's behavior! We kept finding Zane' many many accounts (more than seven if you're wondering) and how he's \"heart broken and forever alone\" we just roll our eyes and ignore him. So Zane gets his girlfriends from different girlfriends from different communities. In all honesty, I think you should leave the communities you're not into alone. \nWell recently we found out that Zane has left my community but still harassing his many girlfriends on multiple accounts (2 or 3) as different characters.",

This may sound mean, but Zane shouldn't be near any roleplaying communities if all he does is harass other girls he's in a 'relationship' with. That's a whole new level of toxicity.",
