            "body": "Here's a long post you probably didn't really want, but, I've been thinking about this lately after reading a number of adverts/posts here, so I'd like to address this post to anyone that gets burned by ghosting.  \n\n\nSo first, the reasons why someone would want to drop a roleplay at any stage, even after showing interest, are numerous. Many of those reasons are completely out of the other roleplayer's control.   \nIf you get ghosted, don't beat yourself up over it. I'd also guess that most roleplayers have ghosted at some point and will continue to be ghosted.\n\nAs for why people ghost, specifically, pick any of the following: **disliking confrontation**, not wanting to be harassed, **doesn't think it's a big deal/the roleplay is a low priority**, major life event.  \nGhosting allows people to avoid confrontation, but also doesn't have the heavy handedness of a \"block\", which triggers some people to go to great lengths to get around it anyway (did you read that thread about the rper that made multiple accounts to request rp from to despite her former rp partner blocking her on each of them? Kind of wild!)\n\nPersonally, I don't ghost anymore because the pool of roleplayers I like is small enough that I don't want to possibly burn bridges; I'm aware that ghosting isn't \"Okay\" in the community, and as I'm someone that goes through phases of roleplaying and then not, I need to be able to maintain a friendly network. For my longer term roleplays, I mainly just want to be courteous for its own sake.\n\nHOWEVER, my deeply unpopular roleplaying opinion is that ghosting is made out to be this terrible thing that it really isn't. **Silence is an answer, the details are irrelevant;** ghosting is basically only a problem if you choose to allow it to be. When I get ghosted, I see it as \"well, they clearly found some obvious incompatibility, so that's one less issue on my plate\". I'd recommend this perspective to anybody.\n\nBonus unpopular opinion, perhaps bitchy: the more a roleplayer laments in their adverts that they \"hate ghosting\" and \"ghosters/ghosting is terrible!\" the more ghost-able they are because they have no chill.  \nNow. I notice a lot of posts on here by people that feel really hurt or frustrated by ghosting, that's fair enough, however it's not going to just go away so my practical advice is not to get so emotionally invested (so quickly) in what amounts to a side-hobby for many people. Different expectations etc.  \nI've had plenty of people express enthusiasm that then fizzles quickly, others start with low interest and then it builds, and everything in between.... You can't know.\n\nEven if a roleplay is well-established, well that can hurt even worse, but the simple fact is **you can't know what's going on in someone else's life regardless of what they do or don't say, so there's no point getting salty.**\n\nAnyway, I do relate to it being frustrating, especially when you have a cool idea you want to try out - all I can say is to keep going and you'll find someone or some people on the same page as you! So, I hope this answers you, and gives you an alternate perspective.",

I tried numerous times to hint that I wasn't feeling it and tell them I was going to bail. They kept making excuses and trying to change little things, but the whole story was like they'd already written it out and no matter what my character responded with - they were doing what they were doing. I didn't feel engaged at all. Finally I told her \"honestly, I'm feeling really bored with this story.\"   \n\n\nShe reported me to the staff of the platform we were on and I got hit with a no-contact order. Now, whenever I'm in a group story and she joins, I'm required by the platform's policy to leave. I'd say people like her are why so many people ghost. All it takes is that one bad reaction to make a person think \"screw being up front, I don't want to deal with the drama.\"",
