As you said: it is an interesting story but perhaps not the most suited now?\nCould you talk with your RP partner? Perhaps explain that you really wanna see this scenario through but at this very instant you can't really deal with something that requires that much energy out of you?

Lovers fight, disagree, certainly... but the instance of his \"romeo\" wanting to kill \"juliet\" sort of puts up a red flag where I think he's throwing your character under the bus. Perhaps his character is just evolving that way so he's just \"going with it\"...to see what happens..and doesnt realize he's causing such anxiety for you.\nI hope your conversations with your partner go well! Best of luck.",
