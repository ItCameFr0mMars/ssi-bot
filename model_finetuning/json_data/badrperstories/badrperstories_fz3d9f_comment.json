I had one time I was looking forward to using a certain character who happened to be a single mother of many. My partner just outright refused midway through RP and wanted me to retcon out the kids and turn the mother into this more aggressive/kinky(???) person. Pretty shitty situation.\n\nIt really sucks when bad RPs just sour you on going back into the fray. I\u2019d say to not let it get to you, but I can\u2019t force you to do something that makes you unhappy. I\u2019m glad you got out of that mess before it got worse though. It sounds like a crappy situation all around.",

            "body": "Agreed with you! If this experience taught me one thing, never be afraid to make your character the way it is. I understand the mild changes (and the ones you want to do!) if your partner finds something triggering - like it brings an uncomfortable memory/situation to them - or you think that this would suit your plot a lot better. But I feel that roleplaying is like a fictional world, and it is a world of creativity, so you should tread it with open-mindedness and have fun.\n\nSorry that this happened to you! Your character sounds very interesting and you can only go so many ways with that, I imagine. I just wonder why people accept to roleplay with you at all - if they're going to try to change your characters. And if they even bothered to care about your character in the first place. Makes you want to think about it. :/\n\nI hope that one day I can find myself back into the world of roleplaying, but currently I just struggle with it. I feel like I can live without it and I am doing just fine.  In my case, I replayed roleplaying with an actual writing. But in the same time - sometimes I will find myself missing writing with other people and sharing the ideas together.",

            "body": "I am sorry this happened to you :( This is so wrong, imho. I think there's nothing wrong helping with one's English (and sometimes gently saying something if they take a notice of something that's repeating you in the writing and thinks they would help you out) - but some people become *obnoxious* about it. I once had someone to take one sentence I wrote out of a hunch and explain it to me why and how I should use each word (and I very well know why I wrote it the way I did). Still weirds me out when I remember that moment. Sometimes I think it was a full moon up in the swing at that moment. \n\nAnd I don't appreciate anyone being not nice about someone's English (or if they're writing in any other language that's second to them). Some people also have dyslexia and/or other learning disabilities. For most part roleplaying has to be a fun activity (and it is a hobby that no one pays you for).\n\nI am glad that you found your way out of the situation and you are writing with better people! Kind and rare gems take a long time to find, but this is why they're called gems :D \n\nOf course! Thank you :) You are so nice! Good luck to you too!",
