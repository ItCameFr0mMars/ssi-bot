If you would basically take their prompt word for word (or their idea was very, very unique) and you did not contribute much, I (personally) would consider it to be doing something wrong.\n\nIf it is a more mainstream idea (like a class system between magic/non magic people, a group traveling together) and you yourself contributed a lot to the development of the world, I think you are fine.\n\n I did that a lot of an rper ghosted me, but I wanted to play my characters regardless. You don't have to discard a whole world you helped develop just because your rp partner has no time for it anymore.",
