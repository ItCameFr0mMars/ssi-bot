            "body": "I can tell you what I've done, but honestly it's always going to be work. I know the dream is to have a self-sustaining server where you can just run it passively and spend most of your time enjoying what you've built - it'll more than likely never happen.   \n\n\nFor me personally, when I feel my muse is draining and my will to keep running my server is going dry, I put on a \"focus music\" video from YouTube and I'll just hammer out content. Even if I have writer's block and I know most of my posts are basically microwaved garbage on a plate, it's activity. I force myself through that wall. I write. I keep writing. If I'm the only one writing, then I'll write a solo scene. I'll have my character thinking through things that recently took place, how she feels, what she's going to do about it. Eventually, an idea bulb goes off.   \n\n\nIf that doesn't work, then I look at my character and think \"what does she want more than anything?\" When I have that, I think \"how can I keep her from getting it\" or \"what would be really inconvenient right now?\"   \n\n\nThen I build an event around that.   \nEx:  \n\n\nMy character is currently feeling really torn because her best friend hates the current system of government and her cousin was recently executed because of a very unfair law. My character is also currently engaged to a \"Royal\", so she can't go all Rebel/Revolutionary without betraying him but she also doesn't feel like his family has the community's best interests at heart.   \n\n\nIt'd be *really* inconvenient if right now something happened in her community where the battle lines were drawn and she was forced to pick a side.   \n\n\nSo what did I do? I planned a server-wide event where the Rebels were attacking her university specifically to help Rebel characters, like her best friend, escape to freedom.   \n\n\nIt's gotten all my players excited again. It'll have heavy implications for my character, but it'll also have heavy implications for every other character in the server.   \n\n\nRinse and repeat. I do events like this in my server once every month and a half to keep things from stagnating. Characters who are more stagnant, focusing on slice-of-life play instead of pushing plot get told upfront \"the choices you don't make will be made for you.\" We don't make their choices as Staff though. Instead, if they're seen as complacent, then the Rebellion automatically views them as the enemy and they're going to be attacked during an event too. No middle ground bs where they just want everyone to be happy and singing kumbaya around a campfire - that will never push plot. That's a boring story.   \n\n\nYour story is star wars, so start hinting at new Sith Lord gaining power. Or maybe have your characters discussing rumors about jedi padawans falling sick to some type of force-spread disease. Build and build on it. If it's only your character getting sick, then hoorah - you're now the star of the show. More than likely, other players will get jealous of the action and start trying to get in on it.   \n\n\nIf nothing else, you can link me and I'll see about making a character to help you push plot. Admittedly, I'm not super versed in Star Wars lore, but I'm relatively active and I'm always willing to play a throw-away character that can die for plot.   \n\n\nHope this helps.",

I mean, I'm having that same feeling right now which really correspond to many of my other attempts of growing an rp server.   \n\n\nJust small paragraph of backstory; this is maybe like the third server that I am trying to push out there with a story and lore that I invest time into myself. The lore is based off a number of things, but written with a friend of mine (to keep me sane) and I'm still writing about it on my own. Just making sure to build up on the world itself, and probably making lots more to welcome in more people.   \n\n\nYou may feel this way from the lack of enthusiasm and activity from your members and how I really overcome that feeling of something is I usually put up a vote so my members can vote on certain things and stuff like that. What I've come to learn about the demographic of people on discord when it comes to role-play is that people tend to be more introverted and mostly quiet. So being able to give them not an overwhelming push in messages, but just allowing them to feel the space of your server in different directions. I'm just saying from an owner's perspective that you might have to push a bit more and balance out what you feel is lacking.  \n\n\nFor me so far, it's working pretty well.",
