            "body": "I'd give it another try message them again check in and see how they are doing. Life gets in the way sometimes. To be honest, replying to roleplays/even reading them every single day especially multiple times a day the other person's responses kind of gives me anxiety. Its ok to go days without talking but of course come back to the person within 5-7 days is a very reasonable request. Even if it's just them saying \"I can't roleplay right now but after I sort out personal stuff I am going through I will get back to you asap.\" I recently had a girl agree to double up she would RP a character and I would do another character in the same show and I would RP a character for her OC. Then we plot it out say how our characters will look, etc. then she ghosted. I messaged again weeks later no response. After nudging her again its been almost 2 months since the whole ordeal started and now shes messaging again trying to come back. But in the time she was gone she was active on the discord roleplay community we met on and she was complaining about ghosting and kept posting an ad for wanting a RP partner for the same show. She was asking to RP another show too and some people responded saying they'd want to RP with her then soon after she posts an ad again. I don't have time for that she's probably desperate and can't find anyone else. So I'm done and don't wish to be ghosted by her again. Also, another pet peeve is definitely when I am talking for a bit to an account and they are super active and talking to other roleplayers they RP with on their profile, tagging each other in stuff and replaying almost on the daily to the same people but then they stop answering my messages for over a week and I have to double message again. Then things for back to normal for a bit and at least one reply every day or every other day then it's back to ghosting temporarily again and it makes me feel annoying. Especially when 2 people I know who talk to 2 roleplayers in particular who do this to me tell me that they talk to those RP accounts a lot. It's like what am I doing wrong and why do they do this to only me it seems in my friend/mutual group at least. Other people who RP this character don't seem to have my problem. I don't expect the RP accounts to only RP with me but why give some people special attention and exclude others? It's like they pick favorites and it's not right.",
