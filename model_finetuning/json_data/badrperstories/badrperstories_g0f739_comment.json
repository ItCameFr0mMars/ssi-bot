In that case, you could point out that by this character just guessing correctly all the time, that it's thwarting your plot and making it hard for you to get into/stay with the story. I've had this before - it's pretty odd but a good number of roleplayers feel like every problem needs to be immediately fixed rather than seeing it as part of the story. In any case, the only thing you can do is bring it up head on OOC, even if it's awkward.",
