I am not saying its good, and I don't tolerate it in any of my RPs, but if its someone you are close to or have been roleplaying with awhile, a conversation can work wonders. I had a friend once who had never done action, this was like our fourth rp together and we finally had a quick fight scene. They broke EVERY rule of roleplay fight etiquette somehow, it was baffling and I didn't know how to respond for a moment.I simply explained this etiquette and they kindly rewrote their post for me. I tried to just be as polite as possible about it. For your guy, you mentioned you agreed to allow your character to get hurt, which they obviously didn't follow. Harder to deal with and respond to without just being like 'uhm ????'\n\nIt is a lot harder to deal with after the fact though, so I try to have this conversation without continuing the roleplay first.",
