            "body": "I think it's fair that when you go into someone's house, you abide by their rules. If their rules are too strict, simply don't stay in their house. Same goes for RP Servers and stories. Someone took a lot of time to go through and make their story a certain way, this is how they like things, if it's not your cup of tea that's fair but then move on.  \n\n\nI'll say that for my server, we have a secondary area where players *can* post aesthetic drops in lieu of posts if they're just too busy to write so they don't get kicked for inactivity. Aesthetics also help with drumming up a muse when you have writers block, if you're a more visual writer/creative. Additionally, for my server, we require faceclaims for all characters. It's not for everyone, and we'd certainly never look down on someone who doesn't like to use Faceclaims, but there's so many other stories out there - instead of griping about or trying to change one that exists and seems to be doing well in how they exist, just find another one. It's not that big of a deal.   \n\n\nI wonder if you're talking about my server, honestly, since we have a 3 paragraph per post minimum, though no one in my server cares about favourite colors or blood types, and we definitely don't depend on discord bots for anything other than dice.   \n\n\nRegarding the alienation of \"any potential players\" it's also important to note that servers can vary in their preferred demographic. In reading this, for example, I would see that you are clearly not my server's demographic and you'd likely not have fun in our story. That's totally fine. There are plenty of people who do and plenty of people who don't. But again, there's so many other stories out there, just keep looking for the one that fits your demographic and leave the others to get their jollies when and how they want to. It doesn't make them bad. It doesn't make you bad. It only means it's a poor fit, which is totally fair.",
