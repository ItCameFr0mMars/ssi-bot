            "body": "Not overreacting, but it's pretty clear that you need a different type of RP partner. Maybe to him, 5 days isn't much and that's super valid. But you need to stay engaged or your muse dips, which is just as valid.   \n\n\nI'd suggest finding another writing partner. You can leave him with something open ended, just \"I need someone who will be on more regularly to match my posting speed to some degree. If you find that in the future you have more time to put toward *consistently* writing, rather than sporadically, then maybe we can try again. Until then, I cannot continue this story.\"   \n\n\nIf he flips on you, it is what it is, but you have needs too and it's not fair that he dips out, especially without communication. Real life comes first and all that stuff, but if his real life means he doesn't have as much time as you then you need to be able to find someone else who can fit your needs better and that's okay.",

            "body": "I want to say that I understand where you\u2019re coming from, and that I definitely feel for you, but I think you need to take a step back. Your partner took a hiatus for two months and is coming back in, which is nice, but it sounds like planning time and scheduling rp time just isn\u2019t working. It might be that he does really enjoy these rps, but where RP is a priority for you it isn\u2019t for him. \n\nI used to have a partner like this and rp died kind of fast because I wanted to rp as much as possible, and they just weren\u2019t in a place in their life where it was the same priority as me. \n\nRecently I gained a new partner who set some pretty clear ground rules. I wanted to rp with this person (perhaps more then they wanted to rp with me lol) so I agreed to them. I let this partner come to me on their terms and their time, and if I\u2019m free I update the rp and message them until the time is up. That would have bothered me when I was younger, but I decided I wanted the partner bad enough that I was willing to rp at their pace and their time. \n\nThat might be something you have to consider for this partner. Maybe they have other things on their plate they\u2019re not sharing with you, or the pressure feels like a lot to do replies and rps. \n\nI do wish you luck though! I feel like I was in your shoes before, and I hope this works out. Maybe try to do things that their pace and let them take the reigns, and if it doesn\u2019t work there are a lot of fish in the sea! Good luck!",
