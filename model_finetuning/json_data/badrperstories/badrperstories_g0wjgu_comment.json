So you picked the five people that you wanted to be on the Away team. How did you pick them? Did you choose randomly and make it clear to folks that the choices were random for how teams were split? Maybe there's a misunderstanding and they think that the choices were based on something else.\n\nIf the teams weren't split randomly, how did you decide who would go where? Did you choose the people who you liked best to be on the side you're writing on?  If it isn't clear to the people who weren't \"picked\" exactly how people were split, then I can understand their frustration. That can breed a lot of self doubt and hurt from people who would then feel they weren't good enough to make whatever arbitrary cut you decided to make.  \n\n\nEdit: fixing a typo",

Sure, it could be because he's a salty asshole about it - or maybe he's just afraid of something, so he feels safer using sarcasm as a way to tell you what he wants to say. \n\nSplitting the playerbase for the purpose of plots is *very* hard to do, you gotta make things engaging for both teams. Yes, the home team could have been salty and decided to just tune out cause they weren't picked. But you mention them lounging about the standard play areas. \n\nWhat was being done to engage them? Players typically aren't interested in plots if there either is no way for them to get involved in any meaningful way, or if they cannot *see* any way for them to get involved in it. Did the Home Team have a \"call to adventure\", or was it left up for them to discover? If it was the former, how was it conveyed to them in-character? (And if so, how was it communicated to the players that their characters can learn this?) \n\nIf it was the latter, that right there was a mess-up. The Away Team was already engaged because, well, they were beamed to the planet, but the Home Team is, well, at home on the ship. They probably had no reason to think they even *needed* to act differently. \n\nHow much *could* the Home team have gotten involved? Because even if you split it evenly... then if the Home Team's only role was to swoop in and save you, then they basically will have waited all plot only to contribute to maybe one or two scenes that could have been done by an NPC - since they basically had almost no agency in the plot. \n\nAnd, like what /u/ThaliaLightfoot said... what determined who was on what team, and how many were on each? If it wasn't equal, why?",

You need 10 for Home Team and 10 for Away team. Of the 20, 18 volunteered for the Away Team, but again you only needed 10. You get a dice bot into the channel (assuming you don't already have one). You assign a number to each of the 18 characters. Then you roll a 10d18, which should give you a bunch of randomly drawn numbers. Each number corresponds with a name from your list of the 18 volunteers. If any of the numbers repeat, then you repeat the roll but adjust the numbers so only those left out of the last roll will be eligible. Do this in a public channel.   \n\n\nThis way, players can be salty about their own bad luck, but they're not able to expressly blame *you* for this. Further, while I get that as staff members we want to play in the stories we've created, it can look really meta if our characters are in all the cool stuff. So for things like this, rather than having all of your staff's characters on the Away Team (since that seems the most popular) you should have the staff's characters sit it out but use a telecom system to be able to help guide the Away Team and keep them on track for the mission.   \n\n\nIn this way, you could also have your characters back on the Home Team pushing additional plot and getting the people left behind to stay engaged. Even right now, you could implement something where something has crawled onto the ship and is messing with the oxygen supply or something. Give the Home Team a reason to be active beyond just waiting around while the Away Team gets to have all the adventures.   \n\n\nAbove all though - whenever it's a choice that needs to be made from a pool of characters, use dice. It covers your ass, seriously. No one can say that you're skewing the game in your favor because it's all there, for them to see and there's proof backing you up. If you want, you can implement a system where if a player finished a scene within a week or for every 5 posts or whatever system you want to base your rewards off of - gets a point. They can use those points to turn in to the staff, trading them for an upgraded weapon **or** an extra name entered into the next raffle. That way, your most active players get rewarded and your least active players who want to be involved start seeing a need to take initiative.   \n\n\nFrom there, if 18 people apply for the raffle to go on the next Away Team Mission, but there's five people who have turned in points to get their names entered twice, then you'd roll a 10d24 with 5 of the character names potentially being drawn twice, but more than likely they'll be drawn at least once. It gets them to see that what they do in play matters and it's not going unnoticed.",
