I've heard multiple stories from players (as well as having a few myself) where the Mods treat that subreddit like a little club where if they don't know/like you then your reports won't be heard if someone harasses you and they'll remove your posts based on imaginary rule breaks, if not outright adding rules after the fact and then banning you for breaking them.   \n\n\nOP, they're really not worth the drama.",

            "body": "Like others have said it's probably the site and not you and recommend you try elsewhere.  Sounds like [rp.me](https://rp.me) is full of wankers anyways if you get that kind of reaction.\n\nMy go-to rec is always [Dreamwidth.org](https://Dreamwidth.org).  It's essentially a journal site, but there is a very active RP community in it.  The only downside is that it does heavily lean towards fandom rp, especially panfandom rp.  There are original characters to play with there so if you want to rp OCs that's cool; you just probably have to be fine with getting a tag from a fandom character every now and then.\n\nIt can be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer to find the specific venues to rp in so I'm going to copy and paste a little guide thing I typed up on another post so I don't have to type it all over again;\n\nFirst; here is a guide to our rp culture as it is a bit different from a lot of other rp styles and we do have a lot of different lingo\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S72FtBvzGCf79Xha5-YNiLYpZxc\\_IRhxKACs9uU6qkk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S72FtBvzGCf79Xha5-YNiLYpZxc_IRhxKACs9uU6qkk/edit)\n\nIf you choose to make any character accounts, here are the best communities to dip your toes into to get the ball rolling:\n\n[https://dear-player.dreamwidth.org/profile](https://dear-player.dreamwidth.org/profile) create fourth wall breaking posts from your character addressing you. Read some of the entries for example\n\n[https://bakerstreet.dreamwidth.org/](https://bakerstreet.dreamwidth.org/) THE rp meme community. One of the best places to jump in to get quick fixes. Read the current memes going on and see if they appeal to you. They can be anything from medieval AU scenarios to In-Character Reddit AMAs Lots of variety. You do have to work a little harder to find threads on these and you can't be torn up if you don't get responses or threads get dropped by others. Memes are casual and for fun and often very short term. The most popular meme is the TFLN meme that goes up every friday. If you tag out on those you will get a bunch of fun threads.  Highly encourage you to try tagging other people's starters rather then just wait for folk to come to you.\n\n[https://nexus-crossings.dreamwidth.org/profile](https://nexus-crossings.dreamwidth.org/profile) This is a popular dressing room. I would say it's probably the best way to get yourself accustomed to the typical style of DWRP. Read the rules and the settings here first to familiarize yourself with the setup. Read a few entries. Then make a post to intro your character in the setting. As long as you're decent and you've got an interesting starter people WILL tag you.\n\n[https://dwrpmasterlist.dreamwidth.org/2077.html](https://dwrpmasterlist.dreamwidth.org/2077.html) finally this is the masterlist of currently running games in the Dreamwidth community. If you've tried a few things I've mentioned above and you find yourself enjoying it you can try out one of those. All of these DO require applications to joining though unlike the other things I've listed.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask, I've been in the DWRP community a long long time.",
