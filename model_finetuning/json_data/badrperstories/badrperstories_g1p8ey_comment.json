            "body": "It depends on the reason! I often see female RPers who only  write 1-on-1s with other women because they've been harrassed, flirted with or creeped on by men too much while they're just trying to enjoy their hobby, which I understand. It's also entirely normal and expected to only want to write with people who are your age, because regardless of whether or not you write mature themes, you'll generally relate and communicate better.\n\nSome would be wary about the reason you've given, because it may indicate that you might (intentionally or not) confuse the character's personality, actions and opinions with the writer's. They could be uncomfortable with the possibility that if your characters were to enter a romance, for example, you'd see it as some form of psuedo-relationship with the writer. That's how the creepy, awkward things happen. I'm not saying that's you, but you should be aware of the optics.\n\nPeople enjoy this hobby for all sorts of reasons. The important thing is that 1) you look for partners that RP for the same reasons you do and 2) that you know what your own reason actually *is*, so you can discern that and find \"your people\"; that'll help you decide whether or not caring about this is a problem. For example, I RP to write and invest in character-focused stories with others without knowing *exactly* what's going to happen next, and since I've had few gender-related issues, I don't care about the gender of my partner. I just want to play a part in creating enjoyable stories! Why do *you* RP?\n\nGood luck!",
