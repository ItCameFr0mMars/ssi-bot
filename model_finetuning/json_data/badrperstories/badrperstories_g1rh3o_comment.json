The thought of something so horrific makes my stomach turn... I once had someone ask me apropos of nothing if I was cool with him doing that to my character and I noped out SO FAST. I\u2019ve only ever seen amputee kink RP that has that twist, so it sadly seems about par for the course that your partner turned it in that direction. \n\nAs for why you feel that way, well, more than likely it\u2019s because your boundaries were pretty clearly crossed? In multiple and serious ways? Not to mention even if it\u2019s imaginary that\u2019s a pretty fucked-up situation. You let it get much farther than I would have tbh, I would have said something at the roofie situation, because that\u2019s already a sign of bad things to come. If you hadn\u2019t gotten out of there at that point he probably would have taken your character\u2019s teeth and eyes next...",
