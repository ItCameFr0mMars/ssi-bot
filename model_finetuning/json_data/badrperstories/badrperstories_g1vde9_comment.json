            "body": "I would agree with all of the above, for sure, and add:  \n\n\n\\- Limiting other players to a set amount of characters while allowing Staff to have seemingly infinite characters.   \n\n\n\\- Forcing account restrictions onto players. I know of at least 3 group stories that force players to change their username (not their in-server nickname) and account profile picture to match the character they have in that particular server - regardless of whatever other stories a player may be in.   \n\n\n\\- Bubble RP, sometimes known as \"clique play\" where they exclusively write with their friends and while they're still technically recruiting new people, they don't actually allow those new people anywhere close to the plot.   \n\n\n\\- Ignoring formal complaints made my players about other players harassing or bullying them, if the other player happens to be a staff member or otherwise friend of theirs.   \n\n\n\\- Being inactive themselves but still expecting players to be able to stay active without any sort of guidance or direction.  \n\n\n\\- Being warms and bubbly to new players that play their romantic preferences, while being cold and distant to players they might view as romantic competition for their own characters.  \n   \\- To that, I'd also add in making it needlessly difficult for their competition to play, apply, or have any fun at all purely because they feel threatened.   \n\n\n\\- Barring characters that are too similar to their own characters from being applied, while also allowing in copy after copy of another player's character they happen to not like in. Basically, any occurrence where they hold people to one standard in one area but not to the same standard throughout the group.   \n\n\n\\- Not being transparent with players. If there's a list of potential things a character can find that the player has to roll dice for, the Staff will hide the list and roll the dice (allegedly) in a location players can't see and then give really cool prizes to players that they like while giving booby-prizes to players they don't. Otherwise just withholding information so they control the game at all times and players feel like there's nothing they can do at any given time.",

Others used it for drug use and other far out things, but no one else played like me and this person did. If this was an issue, then fine the GM could have told us and we would have stopped or taken it to DMs. Instead the guy decided the server wasn't active enough and he was going to delete it. I wasn't happy but whatever, he eventually did. Then brought it back with the exact same concept. So I went and claimed the character I had before (it was fandom based). The GM deleted any reference to me claiming it or me saying I was going to claim it without talking to me. This was so a friend of his that had played the character in the past could have it. Annoying, but I would have been fine if he was upfront. I expressed my annoyance at it to a couple other players, and he put up an announcement that the game was a dictatorship not a democracy and he could do whatever he wants. Though people claimed characters, including the person to take the one I was playing, it is a month later and not a single line of rp has happened. I think it left a bad taste in the mouth of a couple of other players, and I was one of the most active people on the old server. I haven't claimed my other main out of frustration and wanting to see where it goes. Now I am hanging in the dead server giggling to myself because rp did take place in the old server, just not rp he liked apparently.",

Call me having high expectations but if you make an incomplete server and expect people to join only to find out a week later you're busy and inactive then that's a sign of a \u201ddead on arrival\u201d server. Mods had all the time in the world to prepare the server but they rushed it, now on top of an unfinished server, the mods are inactive and people are leaving which means no one to rp with and no progress is made.\n\nMore are: \n\nOne's that make vague or too specific rules made for a 000.2 chance of happening then changing their rules when people will just find a way around it and exploit it. Good luck reading through +20 rules + edits on each one that spans out to 4 months. \n\nMods not updating the members about why nothing in the rp hasn't started yet. \n\nMods that accept any character bio even if they don't provide things about their abilities or even their backstory. Promotes laziness and people's power-playing abilities.\n\nAdding races that have too many or too little advantages creating an influx of one or two races being created. For example, a race that would be too disadvantaged would be humans because they can't use magic, a race that would be an advantage is a Mermaid that not only can swim in the water for long periods of time, but can move on land and use magic with no consequences. I've seen this play out horribly with members fighting each other because they think it's unrealistic for a human with no powers beating a witch that can cast multiple elemental spells and have shields against a human who only had a dagger. Literally, people would play humans in defiance with the goal to forcefully have the mods see the flaws of unbalanced races. So now battle scenes just become your typical underdog anime fights with the underdog winning by overcoming the odds in illogical ways. (coming from someone who watches anime)\n\nUsing slang and profanity when describing important things such as events, plot, lore, and character templates. For example- \n\n\u201dHere's our lore n shit: Dragon came and fucked up the planet yeah. People died, terrible shit and fuck up.\u201d It ends up looking unprofessional and sloppy. \n\nI have more but I feel like if I kept going ill have to put the rest in a 10 paged long Wattpad story.",
