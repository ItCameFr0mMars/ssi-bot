Before they've even applied, they start telling you that your wording is off, that you should rewrite things, basically just nitpicking how you've set up your story.   \n\n\nHonestly, if this was a post on r/AITA , I would vote YTA on this.   \n\n\nThe owner might be super chill still, but you just went in and started picking apart all his efforts. Like, why? Did he *ask* for your opinion? Probably not. So you probably just came off looking like a major rude ass.   \n\n\nIt's the equivalent of walking into someone's house when they're throwing a party, going up to the host, and saying \"Your house is cool, but your furniture sucks. Also I noticed you took the time to make a bunch of snacks for everyone - but I think your cooking is terrible. You should go out and buy more snacks that fit my taste. Also this party's crap, and I can throw a better one.\"   \n\n\nDude, I would have banned you too with how your attitude comes across in this post.",

The server means a lot to me and I don't really appreciate people coming in and questioning my rules when it's worked like that for us for months. There's plenty of servers out there that do the semi-literate thing. Also sorry for anouk, I apologize for kicking you since I was afraid it was a raid. That was my mistake and it won't happen again.\n\nAs for the 100 words, it's not to make casual roleplayers look like idiots. I know everyone has a different roleplay style. That's just the way it works for us.\n\nIn conclusion, Swag.",
