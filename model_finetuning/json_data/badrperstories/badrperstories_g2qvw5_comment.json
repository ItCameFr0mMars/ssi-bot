            "body": "I feel like servers/mods should consult Table-Top RPGs for ideas on how to blend a world that features fantastic and mundane characters. DnD does this very well in that non-magic classes \\*can\\* stand their own against monsters and the arcane. Obviously, if something is way more powerful than the characters, then they're either going escape the fight with a few scratches or die trying.\n\nGranted, I'm not versed at all in how severs operate, but I also think it should be a community effort in making sure everyone is having a good time. The goal at the end of the day is to have fun, not to lord over each other with how \"awesome\" your character is. Also, since it is a co-operative writing effort, there should be discussions on the outcomes of fights, especially if character's lives are at stake, before the scene takes place if it's PvP. And a mod should never set off to kill any characters unless it is made clear to be a deadly encounter.\n\nFrom everyone venting their frustrations on here, though, it seems like a lot of servers are filled with people who don't know how to not god-mode or think about anyone else's character but their own, so maybe I'm being a little na\u00efve here. Would love to hear some feedback of whether I'm on the mark or not.",

            "body": "I usually use the DnD stuff to balance out characters. Not all but some. But I think it derives from mods being horrible and lazy at story building and leaves out too many blindspots. They never consider the long term effects of things going unbalanced. \n\nThe worse offenders are the ones who are aware of the fact that things are unbalanced but don\u2019t change anything, it\u2019s the reason why they don\u2019t dare to play the races who don\u2019t have powers but have all these ocs that have magic. Most of the time it\u2019s to ensure they have power in the rp and that they\u2019re afraid to lose it, and most of the time they\u2019re the ones with the shitter writing because fighting as a non-magic race requires to to put in much more detail into what they do. It\u2019s easy to half-ass it if you\u2019re someone with magic and you go like \u201cShoots three fireballs at person A\u201d but it\u2019s not easy to say \u201cgoes up and stabs Person b\u201d if you do that you\u2019ll get called out for auto hitting. Hence why non magic races will go far to take advantage of poor writing to win a fight. \n\nAnd about that monster part. Honestly I rather have my oc get killed entirely than spending hours trying out different strategies to take it down with all of them not working but here comes a mage using a tactic I tried before and it works. Bonus points if it\u2019s the same mod who controlled the monster. You\u2019ll be lucky if the mod specifies that the monster is hard, deadly, and could result in your character\u2019s death. So really any monster encounter could be rigged in favor of the magic users or mods. \n\nRoleplaying in itself used to be a hobby that requires communication, care, and support. People nowadays care about themselves than others which creates an echo chamber of toxicity. More server owners are lazy and leave it to the members to keep the server/group afloat.",
