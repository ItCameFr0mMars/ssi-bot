            "body": "Oh yeah reminds me of a superhero rp I joined. So I basically controlled the remnants of the government in it and by extension the military since I had an idea of how those worked. This meant that all my bog standard characters would end up going against very powerful individuals. The idea was that each person was weak, but as an actual unit they were quite decent, and with the army they acted as a very strong peacekeeping force. \n\nDidn\u2019t work out that way though. We had a lot of heroes and no villains, or villains who were super inactive. As a fix, one of the admins made a character. A super, super strong one who controlled all the elements, dodged things at light speed, and was pretty much able to fuck up all the heroes and the entire army. Shrugging off hellfire missiles like it was nothing. Eventually the most powerful hero takes him down with a lot of punches and all is well. \n\nThat should\u2019ve been the end of it. A decently challenging and interesting villain. Nope, now damn near every character from these two is some sort of half-god who controls a nebulous \u201cenergy\u201d that can do everything from just electrocute people to making sentient creatures that interact with the physical world but can\u2019t be hurt. Nobody can stand up to them as their usual arsenal of attacks is some super solar beam and faster than light attacks, it\u2019s honestly so grating but because they\u2019re admins nobody can do anything about it",
