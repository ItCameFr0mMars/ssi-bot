My character was supposed to be her mentor (there was not much of an age difference, and both characters were adults) who should teach her how to control her magical powers. He was a very positive character, and was described as a good teacher.\n\nSo when her character failed some practices, I was a bit...shocked, when my writing partner suggested that he would spank her as a punishment. She did not understand why I argued that my character would NEVER subject her character, a abuse victim (and my character knew of this) to the kind of abuse she suffered as a child. Spanking was apparently my play partners kink or something.\n\nYeah, some people just seem to use abuse as something to make their characters more interesting, and bring up the consequences of this abuse only when it suits them...",

I get that something like that would need to have been dug up, but this sounds like they just suddenly did a massive character overhaul in the middle of a story. It's just kinda...idk *bad writing*. And frankly, sexual abuse as a character trait is iffy. So dang iffy. I'm really not here for role players who make assault or abuse into something used for entertainment.   \n\n\nAnd clearly, you're having trouble getting over this. I'm inclined to think that a player who can so flippantly do this will probably do it again. Might just be better to move on and find a new writing partner.",

            "body": "I think that some people have a hard time understanding how abuse shapes a character. I have one character with serious abuse in his history, and I let my partners know straight up, this character was abused in such and such way, and it motivates their actions in such and such way. The following examples are kind of long lol I apologize. \n\nA rp I\u2019m currently doing hit a rocky point (for the characters, not the players) because my partner\u2019s character\u2019s actions sort of dredged up anxieties that spring from the abuse my character faced in the past. Both characters are trying to work through it. We didn\u2019t make it like an after school special thing. It\u2019s been a few in rp months since the incident happened, but they still have moments where it\u2019ll come back up in arguments. Because that\u2019s how people are. Both characters are working through how to handle the changes in their relationship, and my character is (finally) taking them steps towards addressing what happened to him and how it shaped him.  \n\nBut I had another partner who used this same character\u2019s abuse and fear as a kind of kink fodder? Which ultimately killed the rp. She didn\u2019t understand how subjugating the character to a similar abuse would only further cause him pain, and cause a bit of revictimization. Eventually the character shut down, and my partner at the time didn\u2019t understand why my character was behaving that way. The abuse her characters had endured were like? Pieces of throw away info. And the rp ended not too long after that. \n\nI used the same character in both examples, and ultimately it comes down to what your partner is looking for in an rp. Some people just want to see their kinks fulfilled, and that\u2019s fine, but they need to be upfront with that. Other people just aren\u2019t str\u00f6ng writers, and they don\u2019t understand that characters don\u2019t get over things with a wave of a wand. \n\nAnyway I apologize for such a long winded reply lol!! I hope that you find partners who can work the nuance of those difficult situations better, and who recognize them as foundational building blocks of the character, not just kink.",

Indulging in kink-based play is totally fine and fun and valid, but it should probably be stated more explicitly up front. And throwing in abuse with no warning, well, everyone's gonna react differently to that, so it shouldn't be done lightly as just a means to explain why your character is into such-and-such with no real thought behind it.",

Like, it doesn't all have to stem from childhood abuse or anything, but what was it that first prompted a certain response? What does it say about their makeup as a person? For instance, in a different RP I'm playing a dude who's a bit of a control freak and happens to enjoy topping his partner from time to time, but I figured it came from some deep-seated, unresolved daddy issues about not feeling good enough and this is his way of asserting control.\n\nBasically, if you're gonna make your character kinky, absolutely go for it, but at least take some time to consider why or how they came to be that way.",

            "body": "Been there sadly with one RP partner who just couldn't seem to create any characters without attaching several horrible abuses (physical/sexual/mental/slavery/etc). Having a character with these backstories isn't necessarily bad but they fell a little into the same category as here: the abuse seemed to be more of a thing they throw on just because.\nMost of the time the abuse is just a crutch to excuse behaviours (example: Their character behaves horrible towards others but \"my character were abused, you can't call them out because then you're also abusing them!) or to steer the narrative to: \"boho woe is my character, coddle and take care of them and never challenge them to get better/get help.\". \nIt's gone to the point where I've stopped RP:ing with them or encouraging plots with them due to this. In my case, I even started to suspect that this might be some sort of fetish for them (though I can not confirm that, but after several years of this and their insistance on our character always ending up in romantic relationships, I couldn't shake the feeling.) \nHaving a character with trauma is all fine and good, it can lead to interesting story arcs etc but when it is like this and the person doesn't really treat it as if it would be a vital/big part of their characters personality/how their character reacts it is just kind of disheartening.",

But not if it's treated with such cavalier disregard. \n\nKudos to you for distancing yourself from that player! After thinking about it more and mulling over the responses to this post, I'll probably just back away from this situation. I can get my vampire-playing kicks elsewhere!",
