If you go back into roleplaying again and face the same thing you\u2019ll just end up being hurt in the end. Ive been in a toxic rp relationship myself that lasted four years. Ever since then I\u2019ve learned to not get quickly invested in rps or partners. If things go wrong I wouldn\u2019t even care or I\u2019ll just leave the ship before it sinks. \n\nAgain, take my advice and just wait. And while you\u2019re at it, don\u2019t get quickly invested in a rp or a person until they have shown they deserved that.",
