I'm one of those types who enjoys build-up beforehand, but even so, I like having the option of roleplaying out a sex-scene, because there's still plenty of room for learning about your characters, what makes them tick, or, on a related note, what turns 'em on, how they might react in a given situation, and so on. It's not all just bumpin' and grindin'. And even when it *is*, that's okay too. \n\nAt least roleplay is, like, the *safest* sex there is! You can explore all sorts of interesting and taboo and kinky subjects that you might not get to otherwise, all from the safety of your computer.",

And in my defense I like to establish the setting and context for the characters, since having them boning down first post feels more like cybering and less like RPing to me, if that makes sense. But it doesn't take thousands and thousands of words to do that, especially if it's just pointless filler to drag the scene out to a \"respectable\" length before the sexy stuff starts.\n\nAnd also (ramble incoming) \"the sexy stuff\" can just be flirtation and intimacy. Like. I'm doing a really sweet thread right now where my character is a mercenary/adventurer and their character is a barber (who is also kind of an informant/information trader/spy). Their relationship/dynamic is established in the starter -- she gives him tips on jobs for a finder's fee. The establishing shot is him coming in to get a haircut and shave, and through that exchange it's established that for him, coming in for a service is a sort of mental ritual that tells him he's done with the violence and messiness of adventuring and can indulge in personal connections, and for her getting to see him is exciting because he represents the more bold and adventurous life that she kind of wishes she had. Like wowee, we've established who these characters are, their history together, why they might want to hook up, and what it would mean to them, and it didn't require pages and pages of drawn-out exposition and will-they-won't-they.\n\nI mean, not that all that makes the kind of writing I enjoy any more \"valid\" than someone who just wants character A to grab character B and go to town. It's all supposed to be fun! What's not fun to me is people who like different types of fun being snobby and gatekeepy at each other, you know?",

            "body": "I agree. I *love* writing (and drawing) smut. It's so fun. In the same way that for some, horror and angst RPs are. There's just enough emotion and character development you can explore through smut like any other form of writing or RP. Yet people view it as something that is \"lesser\" or a \"waste of talent\" when it comes to both written and drawn smut. Not necessarily because sex is dirty, but because creative *eroticism* is considered dirty and disgusting. While they may not vilify the act of two people having sex, the focus on it or *creatively* making something erotic is *gross as fuck*. \n\nI don't mind doing RPs that are a mix of plot and smut. I actually *love* them... But the main aspect of the RP I'm looking for *is* the smut. I understand wanting some buildup and for the characters to not just hop into bed and fuck and say goodbye. But people do that because they feel like smut is something they *have* to do rather than just an optional part of RP like anything else. It's still pretty annoying though and I don't really respond to people like that. It would be like if I went to someone who wanted to do a long, plot-heavy and epic RP only to be like \"I'm willing to do it if it has *a lot* smut in it.\" like common fam wtf?\n\nSome of my best RPs have been based around smut. Like yeah sure it doesn't start with them jumping into bed and fucking, but like... smut was a huge driving part of it. Like our characters met, had a good laugh and drink, had to share a room because there were non other available in the inn and it was in the middle of winter... ended up sharing a bed and being horny and caving to their feelings... and now likely traveling together as playful fuck buddies. Plot and smut... peacefully connected. \n\nWhile everyone talks about people who like to do ERP having boundary issues, I wonder if all the focus on ERP and a lack of boundaries make them fail to realize that many SFW RPers have the *same* or *similar* boundary issues. Like I've had SFW RP partners who've really pushed the boundary of things that I'm fine with or want to do, or outright ignore things I want to d because they aren't things *they* want to do while still expecting me to cater to what *they* find fun and interesting, etc. I've had people who've come to me when I'm looking to do NSFW rps and say \"I'm willing to do *some* smut.\" and it's just like... if you *don't* want to do it and *don't* want it to compose a sizeable amount of the RP, don't ***approach*** *me*? Like it would be different if they said: \"Hey, I want to do smut but I also like plot-based RP, that cool?\" then I'd be like *hell yeah* *all for it*. Cause then we can do equal amounts of plot and smut, hell even plot-based smut.",

            "body": "I'm gonna be completely honest with you dude, when you are projecting too much onto your RP (calling it \"stress relief\" and using it as a replacement for IRL intimacy) it comes across loud and clear and a lot of women are not comfortable with that. It puts people on edge, especially people who have had bad experiences with poor boundaries in the past.\n\nI think it comes down to a fundamental difference in how (most) men and (most) women experience fantasy and wish-fulfillment, which I think (based purely on observation) boils down to how men and women are socialized to interact with their sexuality.\n\nMen tend to use RPing to indulge in wish-fulfillment by expressing power/sexual fantasies through their characters, and while women do that too sometimes the majority of them are indulging in wish-fulfillment by exploring character dynamics and scenarios. Because of this I think men have a harder time separating the RP from their relationship with their RP partner, because on some level in their minds they ARE their character and assume their partner must feel the same way.\n\nSo I think the sentiment of \"guys only wanna RP smut\" includes an implied, \"and they're REALLY weird about it both IC and OOC.\" I am sure this isn't true of all men, but in 15 years of RPing I have never RPed with a straight man whom I did not ultimately have to block.",

But I didn't even consider the parallels between that and people who want to RP tons and tons of angst and abuse and hurt/comfort. It's a similar theme in that it can be a foundation for meaningful and fun character exploration (if you're into those themes), but is also a genre where people will project WAY too much and end up seriously violating other people's boundaries in pursuit of it.\n\nBut like, I don't see it getting dogged on nearly as much as ERP. People might poke fun at it sometimes but folks don't go out of their way to vilify it or make the people who enjoy it feel bad for liking it, you know?",

Escapism at its finest because the scenarios, settings and characters are negotiated and tailored to my tastes. I don\u2019t need much of a plot with long-term partners. Perhaps this reveals some fears I may have around intimacy, but for now it\u2019s fun to engage in sexual scenes that would be considered risky or illegal.  \n\n[No. Do not consider this post to be an ad for Roleplay]\n\nMy assumption is that I\u2019m RPing with actual men who want to discuss their fantasies in detail and, like me, get a kick/rise/fap-worthy satisfaction out of seeing them play out before them on-screen. Frankly, I want to hear that the RP is exciting them. Maybe that\u2019s a kink?\n\nSo far, no blocks or bans. No insistence on things I\u2019m uncomfortable with either IC or OOC. (Im actively knocking on wood here.). I also am 30+, have been RPing for a long time and am good at establishing and holding boundaries mostly because I\u2019m not afraid to walk away. \n\nBut I definitely have enjoyed this whole post and many of the responses that are standing up for those who are clear and direct about seeking out ERP. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it I have probably missed out on a lot of the negative judgments people have about smut RPErs. I kinda knew this \u201csmut people are bad people\u201d opinion was out there, but it felt like something that didn\u2019t affect me or impede my ability to have my needs met. I\u2019m going to make the groundbreaking assertion that it is because I\u2019m a woman and can probably find more RP partners who want the same things I do while the men who seek the same have the stigma of being assumed to be creepy, cringy, thirsty bastards.",
