            "body": "It\u2019s a complex problem with a simple solution. I\u2019m guessing you, like a lot of rper\u2019s, tend to do just one genre with the same characters or same gender characters and pairings over and over and over again yeah? I bet you\u2019re diving into what you believe is a wonderful and different story only to find that it\u2019s dreadfully the same and getting boring quickly. Perhaps your partners are writing too little, too much, too often or not often enough. Perhaps your problem stems from non rp related stress, either way the solution is simple but requires these steps.\n\n1: take a good long look at your previous rps, what you once looked for in partners and what genres you do and compare it to your present rp\u2019s and rp partners. Make a little list of the differences and circle the ones you think you should\u2019ve kept and underline the ones you think should change whilst writing those changes down next to them. Tedious but beneficial.\n\n2: approach your partners and explain the situation to them. Don\u2019t constantly apologise for what is beyond your control though as a lot of rper\u2019s with less than good (*cough cough* ghosters) tend to exhibit the pattern of constant apologies and you may find yourself blocked or having a full blown misunderstanding. If your partners reprimand you however or start to get nasty block and unfriendly. A good partner will understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\n3: expand your horizons. Only done slice of life? Dive into a sci-fi rp packed with action. Only done fandoms? Try something original. This doesn\u2019t Apply to only settings though, experiment and explore different types of characters and character pairings. Try writing as a non human character, not only does it provide a new challenge to test your writing muscles but it allows for a lot of creativity that is often restricted in human only characters.\n\n4: reach a compromise with yourself. You feel bad because you think you\u2019re letting others down. Write an rp goal list and start with easy ones like building up the amount of quality you put in your writing or how much you write and the frequency of which you respond and work up to more goals once you feel you\u2019ve completed enough to move up a level. Try to do the same with any partners you want to keep, it\u2019s not really going to work if you decide to write only once a week and you\u2019ve not let your partner know or that you\u2019re going to write less and build up gradually whilst they may still think you want multiple paragraphs.\n\n5: remember that it\u2019s okay to take breaks. Rping is a hobby, life will always come first.\n\nHope this helps.",

Some people like character creation but they don't actually like to RP. This kinda sounds like that situation. I've seen some things like that before. Like, in the Sims or an MMORPG, I'll spend hours making the toon but when I get to actually playing, I don't want to.\n\nSame concept.\n\nI'd suggest either finding an avenue that's similar to RP but isn't RP, or finding an active group with an outlined plot where it's not as much pressure on *you* to determine where the story goes. One on One play can be draining because the plot only moves if both players are actively engaged. A group might be just what you need - where you don't have all that pressure.",

Or, and this *especially* happens when I've plotted out a long-form RP with someone, especially when they are a very, very good writer, I just acutely lose all confidence in my writing and am embarrassed by my posts and just feel kinda paralyzed and end up either ghosting or trickling off.\n\nLike a few other folks here have suggested, the solution for me was short-term RPs. Not one shots necessarily, just RPing one chapter or vignette at a time rather than having a huge continuous story. That way you can figure out pretty quickly if something is working or not, focus on other characters or scenes if you get bored of one, and you'll feel more accomplished having nice complete little pieces to go back and read rather than a meandering story that slowly fades out.",
