            "body": "Hello!  This is a very tricky problem unfortunately you cannot control what other people do, you can only control your own response and boundaries. \n\nYour friend plays what I call \u2018victim\u2019 characters.  These characters are constantly victimized by situations/other characters and/or otherwise in constant need of rescuing. Your friend uses this as a way to dominate the rp rather than share the spotlight with you. They can hijack the most innocent scene and make it a contender for an Academy Award Winner in Drama.  It.  Is. Exhausting.\n\nMy experience with these rp partners is that they generally have never polished their cooperative writing skills. I\u2019d have a conversation with them and gently express your concerns and offer examples of what you would prefer to not encounter in the rp. You might also encourage them to think of plot points that do not involve their character needing a \u2018rescue.\u2019  Or, something you can both do\u2014 you each challenge the other to come up with small plots that make the other person\u2019s character the Star. \n\nI\u2019d like to commend you on wanting to preserve your friendship over the rp. That\u2019s some solid priorities.",
