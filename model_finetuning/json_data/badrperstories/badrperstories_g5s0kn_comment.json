            "body": "I used to roleplay in Cherp and Cherubplay before. But my roleplays were more fandom-based always. I really love how beautifully the site is done and also it is so easy to manage it!\n\nBut I was someone who would post prompts and I would be very excited with an each response I'd receive to it. Sadly, they would not last more than just me sending them a starter. They'd never respond back to me or would tell me what I did wrong so I could redo them. But they would always have to run somewhere, so it is for me to write a starter. And I would happily oblige to do it! (Plus, starters have never been an issue to me).\n\nBut they never would disconnect on me.\n\nI think hat this is just a common issue. People are too afraid to tell each other they don't want to roleplay with you - so they just ghost you. I wish things were different and we were all more communicating with each other. After all, roleplaying is about interacting with each other. \n\nI can spend weeks waiting for a response and I would still be just as excited to roleplay with that person.  :/\n\nSorry this happened to you, dear. *\\*hugs\\** Please don't think that you did something wrong. I just feel like you didn't connect with that person. But don't give up and keep trying. Make prompts of your own and hope that you will find your ideal roleplaying partner one day!",
