For me, it will always be fun because no matter how perfect the historical accuracy and suspension of disbelief is if it isn't *fun* and *enjoyable*...\n\nThen what's the point? For me, first and foremost should be whether or not something is *fun and enjoyable*. If it is fun and enjoyable, then eh who cares that a character things a corset is a torture device or just slips her massive ball gown off? Is it really going to matter too much to the *fun* aspect of storytelling and RP that the characters have more modern clothing? Or clothing that isn't entirely accurate?\n\nIf you're trying to get to the smutty bits, is it more fun to meticulously describe how the dress comes off with total accuracy or is it more fun to just kinda have it slip off or skip over that part and get to the smut?\n\nWhen it comes to writing and storytelling, there is a reason various artistic licenses exist. Sometimes you have to \"break\" reality or not be 100% realistic and accurate in order to keep the story going and to just keep it enjoyable. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve is when something needs to be so meticulously accurate or believable that writing it is an absolute bore and feels more like a chore than a fun activity.",

            "body": "Honestly, I prefer it the other way.\n\nUnlike you, I prefer the more generic medieval setting with minimum historical accuracy because it confuses players. Even amazing roleplayers may not fully know about the history of Europe, much less the world, and accuracy can make it difficult for them to write and enjoy a story. And I would rather they write well and fuck up the accuracy than get the accuracy right and get bored three posts in.\n\nPlayers traveling together in those days (and let's just be generous and say Renaissance period) would have bathed in cold water a couple of times a year. I do \\*not\\* want to read about the way they smelled or how their clothes got crunchy and dirt-stained. It's not important to me. Outhouses were just becoming a thing (barely) and seriously, I don't want to read about anyone finding a tree to do their business either. So if they want to pretend toilets were a thing and their characters are largely clean, please be my guest!\n\nI agree with you 100% that the word \"medieval\" is used shorthand for pretty much anything between Joan of Arc to the Victorian Era. But for RP purposes, that's often a useful way of identifying a well-known swath of time and it's being used to talk about an imaginary setting anyway, where we might as well have running water if the plot deems it so.",

            "body": "I think \"accuracy\" was a poor word choice on my part, I should have used \"believability\" to get my meaning across a little better!\n\nThe problem with the concept of \"generic medieval setting\" is that it creates this assumption that the history of western europe is a template for how any fictional culture would develop. You mentioned bathing, for instance. Bathing fell in and out of favor in Europe not because people hadn't figured out how to bathe, or weren't able to bathe, but because *people thought bathing was a sin.* Romans were all about baths, they had all different flavors and temperatures and types of baths, and they were around way before the Renaissance. And in other parts of the world where bathing wasn't seen as sinful or frivolous, or where conversely being clean was actually seen as being more pious, folks would have bathed pretty frequently. So if the people in your fantasy world have access to clean water and aren't influenced by the values of Middle Ages Christianity, then yeah they'd probably bathe often enough to maintain a socially acceptable standard of hygiene.\n\nLikewise it's not unrealistic for a setting to have running water, or gunpowder, or steam engines, or any technology that'd be anachronistic in realistic historical fiction. Those things just work better when they're established and have weight in the world. If your fantasy setting has running water, that makes it easier for people to bathe, wash their clothes, and cook at home. It's going to make a big difference in what home life looks like in this setting vs one where all the water has to be pumped from a well in the middle of town, or drawn from a spring in the forest.\n\nAlso \"believability\" doesn't mean all your characters' bathings and bathroom-goings need to be played out in the fiction, but knowing what normal life looks like (what is their morning routine? Where/how do they buy groceries? Who makes their clothes? Where does garbage go?) gives a more solid framework for everything else that happens in-world.\n\nSorry for the walls of text lol this is something I think about a ton!",

And that makes it a useful -- if completely incorrect -- shorthand. And you're spot on that the hangups of that location and those timeframes are a small part of a much larger picture that was the world! Completely agree.\n\nI think we differ on whether it's important or not. For some people it absolutely is. I've roleplayed with people who find it useful and who need a world that's well-established and throughout (to your point about the differences in life quality across the board based on running water). \n\nBut that's not true for everyone and I think I'm one of those people who doesn't much care if the world is flimsy around the edges and the scaffolding's falling apart underneath. As long as my partner and I agree on what the world is like, its accuracy -- or lack thereof -- doesn't bug me at all.\n\nAnd that's not to say you don't have a valid point OR that it's not frustrating. I can't imagine going to r/Roleplay and reading half a dozen posts all mentioning \"medieval fantasy\" and knowing none of them probably mean those words at all.

            "body": "I agree, like I said it's not really fun for me when folks want to RP a fantasy setting as though it's a carbon-copy of a real historical period. Especially since people who do that tend to be freaking experts on the exact setting they want to RP. I do like spending a lot of time researching for my writing because I am a nerd, but not to the point where I have like... anxiety lol. Creative anachronism is part of what makes fantasy settings cool.\n\nAlso... I think clothing and food and day-to-day life are the framework to anchor the more fantastical aspects of a well-built world. Having an anything-goes setting where characters make modern references and do modern things and wear modern clothes can actually be completely awesome, but for it to be *good writing* (and like... whether or not RP needs to be \"good writing\" is a whole 'nother beast, 'cause honestly I don't necessarily think it does) it has to be a deliberate part of the setting, not just be that way because the writer didn't want to put any planning into the construction of how their world actually works. TAZ: Balance did a great job of this, I think! And for a more serious settings, JRPGs tend to knock that out of the park. The settings are SUPER anachronistic, but they are consistent and have rules, and that makes them believable.\n\nI mentioned in another response that I think \"accuracy\" was a poor choice of wording on my part, I should have went with \"believabilty.\" The reason I find a lot of fantasy settings to be frustrating to work in is because folks tend to lean too heavily into tropes without really considering how daily life works in the world they've built, and that impacts believability to me. \n\nAnd like... yeah, if our characters wanna have a scandalous quickie but they're wearing full-on Rococo formalwear, having them figure out how to make that work is fun. Solving problems within the framework of the world we've created is fun to me, it's what I like about RPing and writing in general.\n\nI feel like if creating a concrete world isn't particularly interesting to someone, I don't really understand the point in writing a genre where doing just that is the entire draw. Urban/modern fantasy, sci-fi/sci-fantasy are a lot more forgiving genres in that regard since anything you don't want to research and develop on your own you can just lift from our modern world, freeing your creative energy for the cool stuff.",

Like I said in a couple of my other responses, I wish I hadn't said \"accuracy\" because on reflection I think my real gripe is \"believability.\" There's no such thing as \"accuracy\" in fantasy settings because they aren't real, they can be whatever you want and that's why they're fun. But not having a consistently well-formed setting anchored by the limitations you've placed upon it doesn't feel believable.\n\nI think this is true with any setting, but I think it's particularly common with fantasy settings because there's SO many tropes to fall back on that people forget that they're tropes. So they don't want to do the legwork of solving the problems presented by their setting, while simultaneously poo-pooing any novelty because it's not \"historically accurate\" (while often having a poor understanding of history).\n\nThe best worldbuilding is anchored in some level of reality, and not having to handwave things in your writing because you know how your world works is very satisfying. It makes the world feel lived-in. *To me,* having my RPs be a collaboration of effective worldbuilding that produces solid pieces of writing that I can enjoy going back to read again and again is really fun and feels really good.\n\nObviously that's not everyone's priority, but it's what I like and what I look for in a writing partner, and I wanted to share the pitfalls I've experienced in searching for that and see if other writers out there can relate.",

            "body": "Aaah I really hate to \"well actually\" since I complained about that in my OP, but \"medieval\" is 5th-15th century. It's a pretty huge span of history that can be subdivided into its own distinct ages, but it's the time period between the fall of Rome and the Black Death. \"Renaissance\" is directly after and is the much more concise 15th/16th century, which overlaps with the Age of Exploration, the 15th-17th century. 1800s/19th century would be Georgian or Victorian, depending.\n\nLooking back at your comment again you may have been referring to a specific period within the church, which I know waaay less about offhand lol. In which case I'm sorry I will lower my glasses back off the bridge of my nose. I hope this doesn't come across as condescending! But it does highlight my point that folks really do be out here saying \"medieval\" and meaning \"literally anything from the Renaissance to Victorian.\"\n\nAgain it's not about accuracy, but the way that historical people lived throughout the ages, and how location/technology changed and impacted that, is super interesting, and often [wildly misconstrued](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-the-middle-ages-reall_b_5767240). I think just doing a cursory read-up on actual people who have lived in a similar environment to your fictional setting can give a ton of depth to your writing, not necessarily by copying it outright but because it gives you better context for how a real person would navigate the world without the benefit of modern conveniences or knowledge that your modern brain is used to.\n\nBut also you're right that at the end of the day it comes down to what's important for the people actually doing the writing. For me, if I have a very good setting the characters grow naturally within it. Having a solid foundation and clear limitations makes it easier for me to make creative choices. And as a reader/consumer of media, I just *really* love a well-constructed world and I aspire to create things that are like the things I enjoy.\n\nI respect that it's not everyone's priority! But since it's mine, I tend to run into a lot of the same frustrations, and obviously I think about it way way too much. I had a really good chat about this with my sister the other day and all these thoughts are just jumbling around in my head lol",

Hopefully I can come up with something kinda coherent!\n\nOkay so I think a lot of the visual language for what we think of as \"fantasy\" comes from a combination of early Disney and the rise in popularity of fantasy/fairytale content in like, the 70s and 80s.\n\nFairytales also have that \"ambiguously in-the-past\" element since they are historically shared via oral tradition, and most of them aren't concretely associated with a particular place and time. But Disney sort of *canonized* them, to the point where just about everyone imagines their trademark princesses when you hear the title of a classic fairytale like The Little Mermaid or Snow White. \n\nNow for the most part Disney actually *did* reference specific places and times in history to create their environments, even if they don't really mention them in the movies. But the designs were also influenced by what was easy to animate, and the aesthetics of the time where they were made.\n\nThen later you get the rise of cartoons and comics like He-Man and Conan the Barbarian, and even edgier stuff like Heavy Metal Magazine which similarly are kind of anchored in an idealized concept of historical aesthetic, influenced by the design needs of art/animation, or what looks badass when Frank Frazetta paints it on the cover of a fantasy novel. This aesthetic is fed even more with DnD and video games, and a lot of THAT stuff is rehashing Tolkien into what has become the standard visual shorthand for Fantasy World.\n\nSo eventually it all gets kind of homogenized into, fantasy is stone castles, charming little farming villages, page-boy haircuts with straight bangs, belted solid-color tunics with tights and those pointy little cloth shoes, shiny armor and big swords, no one is darker than a paper bag (unless they're evil), and every single woman wears [this exact dress](https://imgur.com/a/1F4NTJI). And if it's high-fantasy, there are dwarves in caves and elves in trees and wizards in robes and probably dragons everywhere.\n\nIt becomes so ingrained that we assume it *must* be based in some actual history, and throughout the years as we make new fantasy worlds and fantasy stories we're just updating and modernizing *that,* making derivatives of derivatives of derivatives instead of drawing on new inspiration and creative interpretation. Because like I said, it's imprinted so distinctly in our psyche we assume there must be some sort of... truth, to it, and therefore deviating from it would be inaccurate, somehow.\n\nThen on the flip side, we get the more recent surge in \"gritty\" fantasy like Game of Thrones, which is really just the same tropes made dirty and edgy and high-budget, but because it's so harsh and brutal we assume that THAT must be what's \"realistic.\"\n\nIt's kind of like when people learn to draw by copying stylized cartoons or anime. The original artist probably had solid drawing fundamentals, and made design decisions that suited the exact work they were making. But when you draw from that, and try to adapt it to your own purposes, you've removed the context of why *they* chose to represent things a certain way and it might not necessarily make sense in your own work.\n\nLike, one thing I notice is missing in a lot of visual design for fantasy is hats and headwear. Sometimes you'll see elaborate helmets or headdresses in character design, but historically and in many cultures people have covered their heads. Like, all of [these outfits](https://imgur.com/a/iaE6i3k) are medieval, and span about 500 years of history, but they all have head coverings. I assume to protect the hair, but also for modesty. But a.) hats are pretty difficult to draw and animate, and b.) wearing big fancy hats hasn't really been a thing for the past hundred years, so it's not particularly appealing to the modern audience.\n\nNot saying that a fantasy setting needs to have hats (I also think they look kinda silly), but it just goes to show that by and large what we think history looks like is constructed by media and not based in much reality at all, so it's a flimsy excuse for why fantasy has to look and be a certain way.\n\nDresses courtesy of [priorattire](https://www.youtube.com/user/priorattire/videos) btw, from her [500 years of medieval fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjsL6QTSW5I) video. I also recommend the ones about \"victorian myths\" and \"victorian realities,\" since they give some really solid context on what moving around and doing daily activities in those garments really looked like, especially if you've only seen these garments in pictures. Really addictive channel :D",
