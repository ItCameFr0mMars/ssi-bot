Both are cool when you're clear and upfront about your limits, but neither are cool when you explicitly tell your partner you don't want to RP that and they keep trying to make you do it anyway.\n\nIf it were the latter, speaking up/cutting them off would be a clear cut decision. It's the same in this case. Boundaries are boundaries, and RP is supposed to be fun.\n\nA gentle criticism, though -- obviously I don't have the full context of your character, but a character who \"doesn't believe in love\" implies some pretty intense emotional trauma of their own, which might influence your partner's justification in making it That Kind of thread. If your character is just resistant to commitment or something then sure that can make for a cute romcom kinda story, but \"convincing my character who doesn't believe in the concept of love that love is real\" sounds like an emotionally heavy concept and I'd kind of expect at least some trauma delving into a story with that pitch.\n\nAgain that doesn't make it okay for your partner to disregard your clearly stated boundaries, just keep in mind what you're projecting when you pitch your stories :)",
