            "body": "Unfortunately, people in RP have massive egos usually. RP is writing which is an art form, which requires a certain level of passion. With passion comes ego. Sometimes, you're just going to have some jerks who can't take no for an answer and who will try to turn your rejection around on you.   \n\n\nThis guy sounds like he was just really toxic from the start, and I can't imagine that changing once the play actually began. You definitely made the right call. His response was really immature, pure and simple.   \n\n\nregarding your questions:  \n1) It's not wrong at all. Communication is very important. It's a hobby first and foremost, if you don't see yourself having fun with someone - then it's better not to waste time.   \n\n\n2) There's never going to be an absolutely perfect answer. Some people won't hear you until you spell it out for them, by which time you're fed up on explaining it to them. I, personally, would fib a bit to save myself from the drama with something like \"that's cool, I really wanted my character to be a sentient rock that speaks the secrets of the universe but can't do anything else.\" or something equally silly where no one would want to write out a story with that because they'd be driving the entire plot. Most people back out after that, and since it's their choice - they can't yell at me.   \n\n\n3) Maybe put something in your ads that suggests you exclusively want to write with nice people who aren't going to belittle you? Or raise your age requirement to 21, if you haven't already. Players sometimes think that just because they're 18, they're automatically mature adults, but that mindset in itself is immature.",
