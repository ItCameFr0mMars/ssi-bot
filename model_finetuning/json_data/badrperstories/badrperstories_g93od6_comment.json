I cannot stress how much time I tell my roleplay partners that side characters should be incorporated when needed. For example, my last roleplay which I ended was with a mob boss is hunting down a woman (me) because they were a one night stand but it was all her plan to just get a code for a safe that contains one billion dollars. But this so call mob boss did not have no interaction with his partners. I mean you can\u2019t have a cartel going on with just YOU in it. I mean he have to talk to *somebody*\n\nSide characters help with the plot also, they could reveal a secret or be that supportive friend etc etc and in some cases (for me) when I have nothing to write about, I take a random side character and talk about them because it helps with the plot \ud83d\ude05",

Of course if the side character needs to have a bigger impact on the plot it will be something agreed previously with the partner who can create him as he wishes (still maybe following some guidelines if there are some) and we already agreed on when introducing them and so on... what I mean is when the characters are separated and you try to make a character\u2019s actions more interesting and natural by making them interact with other random people... a bit like in those games when you can intract with random citizens that tell you the same three lines... idk if I explained myself",
