            "body": "Yep, been an owner and an admin for years, and recently retired from being an admin in any rp server. Welcome to the world of roleplaying, where hope only leads to disappointment. But you might as well just tell everyone how you feel because things may or may not escalate to the point where you\u2019ll be telling someone off in two paragraphs when they just said a simple good morning to you. Other than that there\u2019s no reason to stay in a server with people who you clearly don\u2019t like being with. What\u2019s keeping you from leaving? Your achievements? The built-up plot? Character development? Memories? Or maybe it\u2019s just one friend OOC you can talk to? Because honestly, it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nUse to be like this, I was a moderator covering for the owner who needed to take a break. I played his character in his place, planned events, and made sure to look over character sheets. Unlike the owner, I'm not quick to use my powers. I would give people a warning before they do stuff. So one time I didn't give another mod (who was related to the owner) a pass to mute someone who only did three dots which wasn't spamming. Suddenly the owner wanted to have the owner role back. I was hesitant and I told him my concerns and had said he's found with it. Turns out he wanted the owner's role back was the power to mute both me and the guy who did the dots. Along with that, he stripped me of my mod role and basically shamed me in the chat.\n\nOne day he made a person who joined the sever in two days a mod. Mostly everyone had a problem with it so I took up all their complaints to the Owner. You wanna know what I got? I was told my opinions were irrelevant if I was a \u201cbetter mod\u201d, I was a dumb bitch and I was banned from the server. The server got deleted shortly after some of the members were trying to get me back into the server. Recently the owner remade the server. That was the first and last time I will EVER give a damn about an rp server. People ask why I'm so cynical about rping is because of clowns like these that abuse their powers and treat their members like shit. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve lost hope in the rp community no matter how many people tell me their 000.01 success stories, they haven\u2019t been through 7 years of failure like I\u2018ve had. Being in this subreddit makes me feel like I\u2019m around people who share my frustrations of rping.\n\nNowadays you can only look for yourself. Get too invested and you may or may not get hurt in the end.",

            "body": "Personally I think it'd be worth considering the following: Message someone you know you can trust that helps moderate your server and ask them if they can look after it for a while while you take a short break from things. If they're willing to, give them the server for a while and leave. This'll give you the chance to take a step back from this problematic member and her group of followers that are supposed to be your friend. If you feel yourself wanting to return, message the friend of yours and ask to take the server back once you're feeling up to the task. If not, then it's better to cut your losses and attempt to move on. It sucks saying that and I know it's easier said than done but if someone is sucking the fun out of something that you made it can be spil crushing to attempt sticking it to them. \n\n\nThe other alternative as you mentioned was to remove them. It could work, but it seems that if you do so there's a very real chance of her taking others with her if you do so so I'd navigate that option carefully. \n\nI wish I could offer more advice but as it stands I know we both operate differently on things. If you want to talk about it with me on discord so I can get a better idea of what's going on then don't hesitate to message me or even some of the other mutuals we know.",

            "body": "It's honestly for the best. A little old school \"Three strikes and you're oooooouuuut\" goes a long way. As for the voice chat, or as she'll likely argue 'private conversations that don't affect the server', you can still take offense to it. But they'll make the arguments that \"It was in private, it has nothing to do with the server! You can't just ban me because I dislike your character or writing!!! :(\"\n\nI'm sorry you're doing with a clique formed around this girl. It's worse when your own people start to turn on you. Or worse, she just gets more followers. Queen Bees are the worse when they form their own hive.\n\nNo more kid gloves. Best thing I can advise. And if it gets to the point where you need to kick/ban her, then just do it. Don't stress on how it will affect the server, don't stress on who will leave your RP setting. If you've had this server for 2 years now, then it can survive. Your user base probably fluctuates from time to time. This would just be another fluctuation. If people want to follow her when she gets kicked, then so be it. But in the end, keeping her around because you're afraid it might affect the server's user base isn't going to do you or anyone any favors. It's just going to add more stress to you.\n\nSo yeah, no more kid gloves. Go militant and wait for the next boom.",
