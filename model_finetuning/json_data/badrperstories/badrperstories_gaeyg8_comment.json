If you try to talk with someone two times and nothing changes, any further attempts won't change anything either, and you need to decide whether or not you can live with the way things are. \n\nCan you imagine dealing with this person for another month? Another year? If considering it make you feel anxious rather than excited, you do not want to be in a relationship with this person and you aren't doing them or yourself any favors by trying to force yourself to be.
