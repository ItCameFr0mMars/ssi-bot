Here, get teleported to the most hellish region of the realm instead, maybe clawing out of it will teach ye somethin'!\" And speaking of which, maybe the hope was precisely that, to get your character scratching his chin and going, \"HMMMM this sounds too good to be true. A little susp. Maybe I should ask the locals about this first.\" I can go on with the possibiltiies!\n\nOr maybe I'm placing too much faith into humanity, who knows. :D All I'm saying is, what you or your character think or is told doesn't necessarily reflect what the other has planned.
