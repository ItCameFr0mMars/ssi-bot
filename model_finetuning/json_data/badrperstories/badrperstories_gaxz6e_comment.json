People more often than than not, in my experience, don\u2019t prefer super thought out responses and instead prefer to have something easy to read and respond to. If that\u2019s the case, the problem is your quality of partners. If that\u2019s not the case, it could be your writing but I can\u2019t judge that as I\u2019ve not seen it. \n\nJust hang in there. I think for every 10 partners you\u2019ll find one good one. That\u2019s the state of the roleplay world right now.",

I\u2019ve given it before but I think it\u2019s pretty solid. \n\nTry to go at the rp in a different manner. It\u2019s okay if the world isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s okay if the characters aren\u2019t like totally in synch. Try to rp just to rp. Look for a scene, or just an rp where you\u2019re responding to one another. Sometimes when you take a less structured approach you\u2019ll be able to build the scaffolding that creates a good story. And other ones it\u2019s just fun to write some crack aha. \n\nMaybe even try to have a premade character? For me whenever someone says they create characters for the rp I get wary. I haven\u2019t had a good experience with that, (that\u2019s just me though) but it might help to have like a premade character and scenario fo jump in with, just to break the ice with a potential new partner. \n\nGood luck and don\u2019t give up!!",

Remember that the goal in roleplaying is to be entertained, *but also to entertain your partner*. That means you're going to want to make things happen, and quickly! The lore isn't going anywhere. Introduce it as it becomes relevant, and preferably while things are happening that push the plot forward in interesting directions.",
