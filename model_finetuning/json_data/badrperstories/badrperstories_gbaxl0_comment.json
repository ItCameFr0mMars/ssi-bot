But if you are going to play someone that is actively avoiding getting involved with others, it'd be great to see the internal process behind it. So, instead of just describing them sat alone and drinking some coffee, perhaps let the other readers dig a little into their minds. What are they thinking? What are they looking at? Do they have any first impressions of other characters in the coffee shop just by glancing at them? That's a kind of non-interactive character that makes a scene still interesting to partake in. But when you've just got someone sat there that's not making any effort to engage in a scene, then there's no point in doing an active session in my opinion.   \n\n\nWe've had a few people that repeatedly have this issue where they must be pulled into every single encounter or else they just won't engage, even if there are plenty of hooks!",

Live sessions only, meaning you need to sit down for a few hours at least twice a week to contribute :)   \n\n\n**The basic plot:**   \n*It all began in a forest just outside of a modern British town. A portal opened to another, fantastical world. It made for a perfect escape for those feeling tired of the mundane cycle of life on Earth. However, what was found beyond that portal wasn't exactly rainbows and fairies. In this 'Narnia-esque' land, war and strife is felt by opposing races (mainly elves and orcs) which find their cultures incompatible. The humans of this world, 'Gilda' as it's known as, are stuck in the middle to either stay out of harm's way, get involved in a faction, or... attempt to put a stop to the bloodshed. With the portal opening and Outlanders coming to their aid, will they finally be able to put a stop to war? Or will they only make it worse?*   \n\n\nBasically, our roleplay group is a mixture between Narnia and Warcraft, if you want the barebones. It's a concept which has been developed for a long time, and our cast loves it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but we're very active and provide great quality work to back up and enhance our plot. All lore is homebrew and easily accessible on our website once a person joins our discord. Plenty of races are also available to choose from. We are constantly adding new ones as we encounter them on our adventures. Recently, we just added dwarves!",
