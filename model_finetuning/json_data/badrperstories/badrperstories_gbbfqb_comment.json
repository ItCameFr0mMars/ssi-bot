I\u2019m personally forward with my ways, so much that I start off by saying, \u201cHey, wanna ERP?\u201d Or \u201cHey, can I (insert lewd activity here) to/with you?\u201d Mind you, I only messaged this to people who were **in an ERP server**. I\u2019ve gotten a few yes\u2019s who didn\u2019t mind it being smut-driven (no plot, no roles), to which I moved forward with. I\u2019ve gotten more yes\u2019s *but* wanting roles and plot, to which I also moved forward with. And, I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve gotten mostly no\u2019s to which I simply said, \u201cOkay, I appreciate you responding. Thank you and have a good day!\u201d and left it at that. \n\nThat kind of trickster mindset isn\u2019t encouraged in our community. I know we\u2019re not monolithic, so I should say it isn\u2019t *widely* encouraged. I was once in a ERP / SFW RP server and in THAT, I would message people asking if they wanted to ERP \u2014 didn\u2019t say the other thing ((\u201cHey, can we (insert lewd activity here)?\u201d)). There, I got unanimous no\u2019s and I just replied with, \u201cOkay, I appreciate you responding. Thank you and have a good day!\u201d and, again, left it at that. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a stigma for us, which is obviously warranted \u2014 especially because of stuff like what you had to deal with, for example. So I apologize on behalf of that person and I hope you don\u2019t have to encounter anyone like that moving forward!",

Even when confronted by a former crush she opted to keep things as friends.  Honestly I was happier with her as a completely non ERP character.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I like a good ERP, but I think sometimes it can detract from a good story when it's too heavily focused.
