            "body": "I thought long and hard about replying to this post, because you are just venting, but I believe I have to say something. I am sorry if this will offend you, because it is not my intention to do so.\n\nI am talking about exclusively friendly connections, because I am not looking for any flirting ooc. But in my experience, EVERYONE who was that...clingy from the beginning turned out to be someone who ghosted me someday or was very, very exhausting to deal with. With not one of them I formed a true friendship. \n\nFor me, this behavior is a sign that they only care about getting online affection in any way possible, and not about a true connection. If someone replies to you with lots of hearts and whatnot from the beginning, always fangirls about anything you say or do...that is a red flag telling me that they are not honest with you, and that they have that kind of 'connection' with a lot of people.\n\nI met a lot of people (guys and girls, because I often do not add my gender to my searches) who acted this way. Telling me how I am the only one that truly understands them, I am perfect, all of my hobbies are oh so interesting and so on. Every picture I drew was the most beautiful thing in existence, they would end all our texts with '&lt;3 love you', and so on. \n\nI was always a bit...taken aback by this behavior. I found it weird and it never felt honest. All of these 'great connections' (their words, not mine) ended very fast. When I created a character they did not like, when I replied to their chats and was not enthusiastic enough, when I did not praise everything they did...sometimes, they just disappeared, and I saw them later on the rp site with other people, with whom they suddenly experienced the same kind of 'soulmate connection' they claimed they had with me.\n\nFrom the sound of it, your online 'relationship' (not in a romantic sense) moved at a very fast speed. This is almost never a good sign. For me, it is a sign that she has done this a lot of times before and she just craves the attention she was getting from you. Sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in the future, you can spot the signs more easily.",

She definitely wasn't the only one here crossing that line.  And if both of you are on board with that then awesome, but you can't call it rp ghosting when it ends up blowing up in your face.

There was definitely something that felt off in the beginning. Seemed too good to be true.

I shouldn\u2019t have treated it like multiple choice.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for this comment. It makes me feel a whole better because I definitely feel like a bullet has been dodged here. Notice I said \u201ca bullet has been dodged here\u201d and not \u201cI dodged a bullet\u201d. Pursuing this could\u2019ve been mayhem for both of us. \n\nHonestly felt like shit since this happened because her RPing prowess was phenomenal. She catered to my kink-list so well. But now I realize that even Superman probably wouldn\u2019t date Lois Lane if she was made out of kryptonite. Subpar analogy, but whatever. Bottom line, I now have a new perspective on this because of these comments and I cannot thank you guys enough. \n\nMuch appreciated!",
