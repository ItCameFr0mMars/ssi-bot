I agree it\u2019s a mixed bags. It heavily depends on what you want to write, but you might have to search for a while. There are a lot of inexperienced users, and while that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, I\u2019ve met people who didn\u2019t know basic roleplay etiquette or outright lied to get a role.\n\nI mostly play male or NB characters with what people consider a dominant personality, apparently, and they were decently popular. Even if I specifically asked for lit, my ads often attracted people who were just desperate for a ship but couldn\u2019t string two sentences together.\n\nPeople say there are too many romance roleplays, but in my experience, it\u2019s hard to find a good romantic plot. While I don\u2019t exclusively focus on ships, I like introducing romance elements when they fit the story. Romance does attract a lot of pushy people, sadly, and many of them are only interested in rushed interactions. Even if your Ad doesn\u2019t mention it, people might ask for a ship. I suggest making your stance on romance clear in your posts, stating whatever you are open to it and in what terms. \n\nI\u2019ve met some toxic people, a lot of them somehow, but I also found a handful of great Roleplayers! It\u2019s totally possible to find the perfect match. You just need patience and a bit of luck.",
