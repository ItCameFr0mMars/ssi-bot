            "body": "I totally understand you. I had a RP I loved very much. We hit it off well, the story was great, our chemistry was great. Then replies became less frequent. Okay. That's fine, people get busy. Then nothing. And more nothing. And the dread settles in. \n\nBut they consistently told me they were still interested so I kept holding out hope. Then, they wanted to change fundamental aspects of my character and the story itself. Because I'm a dumb dumb, I said yes. It went alright for about a week, and then the same thing. Nothing at all, but they're still interested, of course. I get that things happen, but they'd also mention RPing with other people so I just... \n\nAs you said, be honest. If you're not feeling it anymore, say so. I don't RP stories that mean nothing to me, and when one ends I am sad. But I'm even sadder and more anxious when I'm waiting for something that will never come. It's really taken the joy out of a hobby I've engaged in for most of my life by this point. Most days I question whether to continue RPing at all. It's horrible.",
