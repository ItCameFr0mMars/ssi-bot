Everyone has different rp styles, and I believe everyone who tries to match together should be transparent in their styles. \n\nIf you are a fast rper who expects responses multiple times a day, it makes sense that the slow pattern would be annoying. Perhaps you can ask him what his reply time is like and if he answers every day? Figure out if y\u2019all will be compatible after this (perhaps this week just got suddenly busy?) \n\nBest of luck \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

            "body": "Creating a character can sometimes take a few days.\n\nIt sounds like you guys are not compatible in what you feel are reasonable waiting periods between posts. The answer is not to keep reminding this guy that you are waiting, but to move on.\n\nHe may very well be the kind of person who writes one post every few days. If that's not going to cut it for you, it's better to acknowledge now that the whole thing isn't going to work out.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with him taking a few days, and there is nothing wrong with you expecting quicker replies. The issue is in the incompatibility; it's not right for you to have to wait until you lose interest, nor is it right for you to badger him when he is moving at the speed that's natural to him. You both should likely look elsewhere.",
