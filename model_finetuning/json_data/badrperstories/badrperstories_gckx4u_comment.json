I hope that things can become more manageable as time goes on.\n\nAs for the fandom... I have never heard of this franchise. I\u2019m sorry that these people have taken something out of context poorly so far, too far. \n\nAs for telling the one person, I don\u2019t think you were completely in the wrong. I mean, I\u2019ve thought about it before. Who I would tell, who would find out. I have a lot of online friends that i talk to daily. I\u2019d hate to leave with no explanation for them. \n\nAnd if that person never told you they had triggers with that kind of thing, honestly you shouldn\u2019t be in this kind of wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you know, but I wonder if the person you talked to was really \u201cranting\u201d and mad at you, or just scared and worried, then the meaner mod took it all the wrong way? (Based on the info in the post I\u2019m not sure how much the first friend actually was mad or just scared.) ((And you don\u2019t have to answer at all, this is just I dunno my attempt to be nice and spit-ball ideas?)) \n\nBut the whole fandom blacklisting you... is extreme. Especially if no one will give you a chance to explain yourself. It sounds like most the people active in the fandom are young... Under 30 kind of young. I just can\u2019t see tried-and-true adults acting in such a way without giving you a chance to explain....\n\nI really hope you can find a new world to love and new fandom to hop into. Best of luck.

            "body": "Oh man is this post my bread and butter as a RPer.  I've been RPing for around 20 years, and my very first RP was Pern via AIM (I'm old shut up) with friends I made on Neopets (I SAID I'M OLD DAMNIT!).  So yeah, I've been playing Pern RP since before Anne McCaffery put out a single book with her son (and I survived Todd going around to all the forums issuing us fake \"Cease and Desist\" letters).\n\nI had a.... kind of similar experience to yours, though on a MUCH smaller scale, when I got back from Afghanistan and separated from the military.  I'd spent most of my deployment on Pern forums but I had serious issues upon returning.  I did pretty well keeping up for a while based on having multiple good RPs going, but I eventually had to take a break when my grandfather finally passed from Alzheimer's.  \n\nI told one of the mods that I needed to put my account on away (if you didn't notify your account got deleted after 30 days and you couldn't access your old posts).  I told her that I didn't know if I'd be gone longer than the 30 days but just in case I wanted to let them know.  She said it was fine and to take care of rl.\n\n I came back somewhere around 25 days later, and my account was gone.   Now, at the time, I had serious paranoia issues so I went straight into being mad.  What ended up happening is essentially that moderator I notified went ahead and turned off my account 30 days after I notified her which couldn't be undone.  I'd actually checked on things for a few days after my notifying her but I couldn't prove that.  And, since she had the date stamps of the conversation and calm response of \"I'm so sorry, I misunderstood\" and I'd reacted poorly while dealing with rl shit, she was the one who was believed by default.  And that's on me.\n\nIs that lady still a POS for doing that?  Absolutely.  But I can't blame others for taking in what they could see and dealing with things accordingly.  It sounds like it's something similar for you.  Unfortunately my mantra for mental health issues is pretty much always \"you are entitled to your hurt and your struggles, you are not entitled to use them to hurt others.\"  This applies even if that hurt is unintentional and you were trying to do the right thing.  No one gets to decided how others take the stress we direct their way.  That's how life works.  \n\nI'm not saying that to try and be mean, or to judge.  Trust me, I have no high horse to preach from.  Maybe a 100 ft deep ravine at best.  I'm saying that because it's important to understand that certain things are out of our hands at some point and we just have to take it as things come.  The best thing for your mental well being is to keep calm and Impress.\n\nIt might help to make completely new accounts and usernames and just build completely from scratch.  If you're ready to move on and others aren't willing to give you the chance?  Change your chances.  \n\nIt can be hard to find a Pern forum or Discord that isn't more open about cross gender Impressions/non canon colors and there are far fewer options out there these days.  I've actually been looking at making my own Discord for use with some of the TikTok RP community but there just hasn't been enough interest to warrant the effort.  \n\nPlease feel free to chat with me if you'd like.  I'm really not as mean as sound when I type I promise!",

She didn't just contact me to let me know she was going to do it, she used the words \"I want you to know this is going to happen, and there is nothing you can do about it, I wanted someone to know\" she wanted that someone to be me, and then refused to listen to any help I offered and swanned off for a few days letting me think she was dead.\n\nI was understandably upset about this as we had a long history of friendship. I talked to my other friends about it and they encouraged me to take a step back because they were worried about the VERY negative effect this was having on my personal mental health. I didn't want to approach this person and say \"hey don't ever talk to me about your problems again\" because it seemed like an assholish thing to do and I didn't want to make the deteriorating situation even worse than it already was. \n\nSeeing how upset it had made me, my coadmins made the decision to remove this person from our site, both for the aforementioned mild homophobia and for what everyone else saw as a clear danger to me personally. Everything that came afterwards, was a result of other issues that had been building up in the fandom for years concerning this person's tendency to cause issues. This person did not allow me to explain myself after the removal or talk to her, I was just informed that we were \"done\" and blocked everywhere. I have had no further contact with this person, nor have I been on some shady behind-the-scenes revenge vendetta.\n\nI wish her the very best, and hope she gets herself into a better place in life where she can be happy.",

            "body": "I would like to start off by saying that I the mod that supposedly \"lashed out\" because I tried to \"pressure her\" into unblocking the admin.  \n\n\nHowever, I have screenshotted and posted the conversation here for people who wish to see it: [https://imgur.com/a/8kMdgLM](https://imgur.com/a/8kMdgLM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, yes, I got frustrated. I got frustrated because OP has a history of treating people like \"the bad guy\" when they don't agree with her or she doesn't get her way. I got frustrated because OP had shot down a lot of good ideas that the other mods of the site she supposedly wanted to keep going down because of questionable reasons and had a history of being an absentee admin. I got frustrated because I explained why I had done what I had done (go to the admin of the advertising discord and made sure we would be okay to advertise there) since Admin had blocked her, and I wasn't sure if it was a site-wide block, or just an individual block. I did not ask for specifics, only passed on that the admin of the advert discord had said about needing to be able to reach out privately to adverters of the site for purposes of rule enforcement on her site.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left the site discord with the intention of taking the weekend to decide if I wanted to continue to be affilitated with the site as a regular member, or if I wanted to leave entirely. I was fully intending on stepping down as a mod because I didn't want to continue to work with OP if she was going to be an absentee admin and was going to treat me like I had done the UNSPEAKABLE for trying to cover my ass and make sure we didn't get a bad rep from sites that DID NOT WANT US to be associated with them. I informed the other mods, in the non-mod chat, that I was planning to step down, because of this, and that I would take the weekend to consider my future position in the weyr.  \n\n\nShe then proceeded to QUIT the site the day before a hatching that was only partially finished was supposed to start. She abandoned her clutch-runner, abandoned the mod chat, and left the site. Given that I had some knowledge of what was going to happen in the hatching, because I had volunteered to color the dragons in for the hatching, when the other mods reached out to let me know what she had done, I volunteered to come back to help finish the clutch AS LONG AS SHE WAS OKAY with it. In the end, she made the decision to leave, and then proceeded to pitch a fit a few days later when she changed her mind and was told that she could come back, but would not be welcome back in a mod capacity because this was not the first time she had abandoned the site in a fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry that OP feels as though we've ganged up on her, but that is simply not the case. OP has a history of using mental illness as an excuse to treat people like shit and to throw tantrums when things dont' go her way, then come back days/weeks later trying to act as though nothing is wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish OP all the best, and I hope OP gets the help she needs, both for her depression and with whatever else is going on in her life that is causing her distress. But the rest of the story is, as I said, not as black-and-white as OP is making it out to be.",

Being in that position, I take my member's safety and well being very seriously. Anyone who is suicidal or self harming should reach out to a hotline or other form of professional help in such cases. That being said...I have the other side of this series of events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOP seems to think this is a campaign against them on my part, while they themselves have done more than enough to have multiple people come to me with their experiences and why they don't feel comfortable with participating in chats and sites with them. I have had my own negative experiences with them and the issue goes beyond the transphobic and homophobic comments. Its unfortunate to say but there is a laundry list of issues that haven't been addressed in their telling of events.\n\nThe ban on the resource site's discord was due to me, the admin, still being blocked when I attempted to contact them. I talked with others about this before I did it, I was going to give them a chance but finding myself blocked made things too risky when there had been issues in the past. I was unable to even try to discuss concerns and talk about setting some ground rules. More than one person said that this was the best move when I asked for insight as to what I should do in that current situation.  \nThe joining of this discord mind you, was the same day that the former friend got harassing hate mail on behalf of the OP after months of silence. The coincidence seemed very ill timed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I will admit outright banning them on my site with no reason given the first time was not an ideal move, but knowing what they had been saying I didn't want to elevate the situation. From our staff standpoint, we had spoken with multiple groups, including the site they ran, and found they had left every single chat and essentially gone dark without offering much reason. This offered us the conclusion that they had left the fandom. We banned them for the behavior the former friend, who has posted their experience in this thread as well with their side of things, as well as other concerns we had that they didn't mesh well with the safe and open community we were fostering on our site.\n\nUpon their return to find out they was banned, they circumvented it by making a new account under a different IP address and only contacting one admin off-site. They didn't wait for a response or reason as to why they had been banned before making this alt account (which is against our rules of one account per person). They did offer a DM to the staff account playing off the situation and acting like they had not knowingly done serious emotional damage one of our staff members. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sad that the OP seems to have a negative feeling towards me, seeming to not recall when we were what I considered friends, and has spread rumors and tossed out very negative words about me to others. I hope they can get the help they need.",

You're bringing it up here, but at the time of our conversation, your word was all I had to go on. You can see why I would be skeptical.\n\n2.) A lot of the ideas that were being suggested went against the initial plot, plan, and rules for the site. Wanting to stick to the plan is not a crime. Additionally, I have a life. People have lives. You maintain extremely high levels of activity and it's nice that you're able to do that. However, the site was always meant to be a more laid-back, slow-paced environment. That not meeting your personal standards is not my problem. You were meant to be an area mod, whose job is to help with plots specific to an area, approve bios, help members with information specific to that area, and do other odd jobs when requested. However, your behavior was that of someone trying to be a full admin. You overstepped.\n\n3.) You did not tell me your intentions when you left the site discord, nor did you say them in a channel where I would be able to see.\n\n4.) I did not ask to return immediately - I messaged my co-admin after I'd had a couple days to cool off and said that I needed to take some more time, a few more weeks or months, then I might consider returning. I was told that they were no longer willing to work with me as an admin. I was /not/ told that I would be allowed to return as a member.\n\n5.) I do not use mental illness as an excuse. I've made mistakes, but I acknowledge and take responsibility for them. I acknowledged where I messed up in this post. Anything I told you about my mental state is because I wanted to make it easier to understand why and how I sometimes feel and think the way I do and that it's something I am working on. I have /never/ said that because of my mental illness you can't blame me or have to forgive me. Those are two very different things.",

I knew that you had a history of depression, yes. I did not know that my telling you this would impact you that badly, nor was I given any way to know in the aftermath. At the time, I honestly didn't think you would care very much. I thought you would be more upset if I did something and didn't tell you, because it would feel like your friendship never mattered to me. At the time I messaged you, I fully intended to go through with my plan and wanted you to know that it did matter to me and I appreciated the time we spent together. In the past, you had messaged me when your were going through bad times or feeling depressed or suicidal. Saying that I actively intended to kill myself took it a step further, yes, but I thought it would be okay. It did not connect that my death could be something people would find genuinely upsetting, or more upsetting than a random ghosting. As I acknowledged, contacting you was not a good decision, but it was not done maliciously or with the knowledge or any sort of belief that it would have anything near that level of negative impact on you. It wasn't logical or reasonable, but it was not knowingly hurtful.\n\n2.) I did not \"swan off for a few days\". I ended up in the hospital that night. I was not allowed access to my phone or email, did not write down any phone numbers with me, and didn't exactly scroll down my contacts list telling people. I might be misremembering, since a lot of that night is blurry, but I think I told one person in the fandom that I was going in. I did not tell any family or irl friends. Most of them still don't know that I went in in the first place. In retrospect, I can see it was an asshole move, but again, at the time, I did not think it mattered.\n\n3.) You never told me you were upset or uncomfortable. I had to learn it through a vague, accusatory message from Mistywren, someone whom you know I was always certain disliked me. Learning it through a third party hurt. Even though I felt like our friendship was fading, hence my belief that my suicide wouldn't be too big of a deal, I trusted you a lot and had always tried to be forward about how I was feeling. You have always taken steps not to let personal feelings or incidents get in the way of staffing, but then I was being told that I was being banned over a personal matter between us. And you never spoke to me about it. That *hurt*. I felt betrayed. It honestly felt like a 'get away from me, I don't want anything more to do with you'. So yeah, I blocked you, because quite frankly, I didn't want to read you saying it yourself. Additionally, I did not \"block you everywhere\". I blocked you on discord, but you were the one who messaged me on tumblr and immediately blocked me there. Glass houses and all that.",

            "body": "1.) Disliking the inclusion of male goldriders in Dragonriders of Pern RP does not make someone homophobic or Transphobic, nor does saying that they don't qualify as a homophobic or transphobic.\n\n2.) I had ranted to several friends over what had happened the day I joined the discord because I was anxious about doing so, stressed, and extremely tired, having gotten little to no sleep for three days. One of them knew the former friend's tumblr, since I'd recommended it to them a few months back. I'm sorry that it happened, but it wasn't me.\n\n3.) It is easy to cite 'negative experiences' and say that there are a 'laundry list of issues' without actually saying what any of said issues were, as it doesn't allow for the other person to explain their side without making themselves look worse, if there is even something to explain. It is a vague and unreliable form of he-said she-said.\n\n4.) Do I need to explain why reaching out to people and asking 'is this person bad' would damage someone's reputation? Or how cliques and gossip work, or how who you choose to approach can effect things? \n\n5.) I didn't create an account to 'circumvent the ban', I made an account to approach the staff because I was genuinely confused and thought a mistake might have been made. When I approached another staff member off-site, I did so over tumblr direct messaging, which many people do not check frequently and does not always alert people when they have messages. I did not *knowingly* cause a staff member emotional distress. Period.\n\n6.) If you don't want to elevate a situation, immediately banning someone without warning or explanation is not the way to go about it. I had \"gone dark\" because my stalker had found my discord handle again, gotten into one of my servers, and spent several hours harassing my friends. I have screenshots if you don't believe me. I didn't want to chance a repeat. So no, I didn't offer much in the way of explanation. That tends not to be the sort of thing you tell everyone about.\n\n7.) I thought you did not like me and tried to be friendly to you in the hope that we could become friends or at least come to an understanding. That's not what I would consider friendship outright. I *wanted* to be friends with you, since while your demeanor sometimes made me uncomfortable, you seemed pleasant enough and I knew that some people really enjoyed being friends with you, but I didn't feel like we ever really got there. And whether you intended it or not, you actions have had a noticeable negative impact on me. (Yes, like mine had a noticeable negative impact on your friend. And I *am* sorry. When I say that I did not know or intend to hurt her, I am not saying that to say that what I did was okay or she is now obligated to forgive me. She is well within her rights to hate me if she wants. The reason I am driving the point home so hard is because much of your point seems to be based on me maliciously and knowingly causing harm, which is simply not the case.)",

Your friend still went after your former friend with choice words.\n3. I am not going to list out all the grievances that have been cited to me since it isn't my place nor is this the place to do so.\n4. You talk about reaching out to people with gossip but that is something you yourself have done. You are calling the kettle black on this one.\n5. You know the person well enough to know they would check tumblr messages, but you were not blocked on multiple other forms of reaching out that wasn't breaking our site rules. It was a poor choice.\n6. You didn't give any info other than leaving multiple discords without a word and were talking of suicide at the time. The conclusions drawn were not only on my end.\n7. When you were on the original site we were on together the first time, we were both very young, and back then I was a little shithead. When you returned under another name I did consider you a friend. After I found out more information of what you've done in this fandom to others, my idea of you shifted. I was never outwardly malicious to you prior to you hurting the ones close to me. You burned bridges with your behavior and I have yet to see any genuine growth or taking true accountability on your part. I've grown since I first joined, what I hope is for the better. I'm not perfect, and no one can be, but we can try to be more empathetic and conscientious of how we portray ourselves in our communities.\n\nIn general the words you have said about me behind my back that have come to light show me this is more a you problem than a me problem. The needs of my members and friends as a whole come before one person, most of all when they aren't ready to change for the better.   \nI don't want to argue but I genuinely hope you can take a step back and see that its not me who has made you feel unwelcome in the fandom, but your own actions.\n\nI think a big thing to start changing how others see you is that you try to change the way you address people, taking accountability, and not giving gut reactions on the idea that everyone is out to get you. I do hope you can find your place in the fandom again at some point, but I think you need to take a step back and consider how to conduct yourself and approach things with a healthier mindset.",

            "body": "So, again, screencaps - not just mine this time, but from your co-mod who you told you were leaving of your own free will because \"the site needed \\[me\\] more than \\[you\\]\" as well as screencaps from your own rules page regarding the Mod team that you wrote and that you approved -  [https://imgur.com/a/icXV5LK](https://imgur.com/a/icXV5LK)   \n\n\nNow, point by point:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I did not show you the conversation at the time because I told you what was told to me and gave you what I thought was a solution to that problem. That is all. You're the one who went off on your spree giving me more detail than I asked for when I offered you a solution. All you needed to say was \"I'm not willing to do that\" and it would have been done. I apologize that my actions came across as overstepping bounds, but I did not reach out to her maliciously about you specifically, only about whether or not your site would be welcome to advertise on hers. I reached out specifically about the site, not looking for details about what was going on between you, her, or anyone else. I have since learned much more about what you've done than I personally ever wanted to know.  \n\n\n2.1)  Wanting to stick to the plot plan is not a crime. Having a life is not a crime. Wanting a \"laid-back\" \"slow-paced\" environment is not a crime. \n\n2.2) Promising people that you'll get things done withing X-timeframe, and then making excuses when you miss that deadline is also not a crime, but it makes people distrust you. \n\n2.3) You were slowly killing your own site due to your string of broken promises to make posts/be active, your serial inactivity, and constant discussion of NEW plots instead of making a point to be active and interacting with your members with whom you had already made plots with.\n\n2.4) I was also not overstepping my bounds by making suggestions for alternative plots/ideas/potential changes when I had been told that we were ALL mods with EQUAL weight in saying how things went. There was no \"admin\" position, according to your own rules on the site.\n\n2.5) As much as you might not want to admit it, ACTIVITY is the driver of sites if you do not want to see your hard work and effort go to waste. If people do not see a site with active members or mods, they will not go through the effort of joining, even if in doing so they might find people who WANT to be active, but feel like their characters are caught up in things that are waiting for Mods who aren't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) I did not tell you my intentions because I was stepping away from you to take that time to think and because, quite frankly, you were not \"listening\" to anything I had said - namely that if you didn't want to unblock misty, you didn't have to because that was YOUR decision. I was done talking to a brick wall. I spoke directly with your co-mod, to let her know my intentions.  \n\n\n4.1) Less than 2 days after you willingly quit the site, you demanded that we no longer use the plots you had told your co-mod were okay to use. Plots that were SITE INTEGRAL as the entire site had been built on these plots, things that could have killed the site you had, 2 days prior, said you \"didn't want to see die\".  \n\n\n4.2) You did the above under the assumption that I was making this a \"me or you\" situation when I was not. I left the mod team. I had not yet made my decision to leave the site completely when you left. Had I made the decision to leave the site completely, I would have done so in a simple goodbye post on the site without drama and would have gone on about my business. You were the one who \"gave up\" the site on your own.\n\n4.3)  The same day you requested us to not use any of the plots, after confirming multiple times that you wanted to leave and that you wanted us to not use those plots, you came back and asked if you could update your \"leaving forever\" to an extended LOA. When your co-mod said she was uncomfortable doing such with you coming back as a mod, you proceeded to block her BEFORE she could offer you to come back as a regular member. The fact that you did so before she could extend that offer is on you, not on us.\n\n5) You do use your mental illness as an excuse, nor do you acknowledge such in any of your replies in this thread to the other parties involved in this situation. After discussing with many other people who you have lashed out, abused, and made uncomfortable interacting with you, that pattern is abundantly clear. That you acknowledge your mistakes in a random post on Reddit instead of reaching out and apologizing to the people that you've wronged in this whole debacle speaks volumes as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry that this comes across as us having wronged you somehow because that is not what we were trying to do. We were trying to save a site that was dying due to inactivity and lack of progress.  \n\n\nI'm sorry that you felt that I was making this a \"me or you\" situation because I was not trying to do that. The site was YOUR site, and I was more than happy to respect that. I told you multiple times I wanted to see the site succeed because I liked your ideas and wanted to see them come to fruition. I VOLUNTEERED to help with the site because I was watching it come to a second death less than two months after you were trying to revive it. After you lashed out at me, I stepped away because very suddenly my volunteer position had become a job that I was not willing to keep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not willing to spend more time than I have arguing a point when it's clear that the intent of the original post was to play the victim rather and try to make this seem like something that the community as a whole is doing to you, rather than something that you've brought upon yourself with your own actions (and inaction, in some circumstances). The intent of MY original post was to offer the alternate side of the story. People will come to their own conclusions about who was right and who was wrong. Likely, all parties hold some wrong-doing because we're all human, but you've lashed out at:\n\n1) someone who you deeply distressed and tried to push the blame onto everyone else, including her, by claiming that you \"didn't think she cared\"\n\n2) myself, for reasons that are already part of this thread\n\n3) the person who you seem to think started this whole issue when she was instead trying to protect the people she cares about. You attempted to discredit her, and several other people, just because \"they are shits\" and \"you didn't want to be associated with them\" but then got upset when they returned the favor in kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that you find happiness in your future.",

Would be hurtful? \n\nI didn't come to you and say \"ray that was hurtful\" because I didn't want to be RESPONSIBLE for someone killing themselves, because that would be on me. Because every conversation or attempt to HELP YOU, ended in you describing how you were going to kill yourself. How would you have responded to \"don't talk to me about this, you're setting off MY PTSD\"? \n\nMy friends looked out for me because I was so upset, so OUT OF MY MIND trying to get you help and thinking you were dead that I stopped eating or sleeping for a week. \n\nYou didn't think it would be hurtful. You had no consideration then, nor do you now for what you put me through. Your words and actions have consequences, and the consequences of yours were that you hurt me so badly that my friends noticed and did something about it, and I withdrew so I wouldn't be hurt again. \n\nI was going to take the high road here, but Jesus.

            "body": "I'll start with this. You say that you were not out to get me and did not intend to cause me harm. If that is true, then I apologize for lashing out and claiming that you were. I did genuinely believe that you were. I maintain that your actions, even if not intentionally, caused harm beyond just banning me from your own site. But I acquiesce that this may not have been intentional.\n\nThere is to me a difference between me talking with my friends in confidence about personal feelings and anonymously posting on a vent site and you canvassing a fandom resource server in order to make decisions on an administrative level. Or maybe I'm wrong; maybe there isn't. Maybe I'll disagree on this later. But for now, by my understanding, there is. One has wider reach and does more harm than the other. One has more influence than the other. This thread was not made as an attack, but as a way to get my own frustrations off my chest. It was a month old and only had a handful of comments. You are the ones who dug it back up.\n\nYou do not know me. You do not get to say that I have not grown, changed, or improved over the years when I can say the exact same thing of you. The way you present yourself has changed, you are more eloquent, but from what I have seen, much of your behavior remains the same from when we were young. You, to me, have not changed. And that may not be accurate judgment. After all, I have not seen much of you, just as you have not seen much of me. I wrote a vent post about what happened, from my perspective, and have acknowledged that it is from my perspective. You are speaking as if what you say is truth and law.\n\nDon't talk to me about growth, change, and taking responsibility and accountability when you have no idea what you are talking about. I *do* try to be empathetic and conscientious, but sometimes other things get in the way. That does not mean that I am not trying. It does not mean that I am not doing better than I was a few years ago. Growth and progress is not aways a straight line, Misty. Sometimes shit happens and you hit a drop and relapse into bad behavior before going forward and continuing to improve. There are even days where you might seem worse than you did before. It doesn't mean that you haven't grown or won't get better going forward. Sometimes circumstances mean that your progress isn't at the same rate or level as someone else, but that doesn't mean that you aren't trying just as hard, if not harder, than the other person.\n\nI know that if I try to explain, I'll be accused of making excuses and being dramatic. Or trying to get pity out of people. Or maybe you already know all this of this and it's just a waste of your time. But I'm not going to sit there and let you accuse me of not growing or trying to grow. Because if there's one thing I can confidently say, one thing that I like myself for, it's that I have. And even if I get accused of all of the above, it's important to me that you know that.",

            "body": "TW; everything mentioned in the initial post, now with a dose of alcoholism and child abuse.\n\nTo preface, I know that I am not in a place that is not mentally or emotionally healthy. I *know*. And I'm trying to change it and trying to improve, but it is hard, and slow, and frustrating and sometimes it feels like I have nothing to show for it. It took over a year for me to admit that I needed serious therapy and treatment and it wasn't something I could shake off just by talking to a few friends and getting out of my old environment. Once I admitted that I needed it, it took several months of waiting to get in. Once I was in, there were a few more months of figuring out exactly what type of treatment I needed. And figuring that out, while it is necessary and good for the future, only drags me further down in the moment, because it is never nice to be told how messed up you are and what's wrong with you. I started trying to get into therapy around mid-2019 and have only been doing active sessions wherein we actually work on stuff, not just more assessing, for a little over a month now. And you know what? Dumb and small as it may be, I'm proud of myself for even getting that far.\n\nAlong with alcoholism and narcissistic personality disorder, my mother had munchausen syndrome by proxy. I was her proxy and the target of the majority of her abuse. I am twenty two years old. I lived in near total social isolation until a few months after turning nineteen. I was homeschooled for a long time, but even when I went to public school for highschool, her possessiveness and other behaviors prevented me from making friends or interacting with anyone outside of class. She made a point of infantilizing me by telling everyone she could that I have autism/aspergers (the severity of which varied depending on her mood), which I later discovered may not actually be the case. She later pulled me from mainstream classes altogether. She gaslit me like there was no tomorrow, told me that I could not trust myself, my mind, or my own memories, and constantly said that various people are out to get me, think badly of me, or look down on me.\n\nMy primary, and much of the time, *only* form of socialization was through roleplaying. I got too invested and intense about roleplay because it was the only thing I had and could control to any significant degree. I made a lot of mistakes and missteps, but I made friends that I valued and always tried to improve. Several of them noticed that something was wrong, but it took ages for them to convince me that I was possibly being abused. I remember being fourteen and fifteen and defending, 'my mom isn't abusive, she just...' or justifying her actions as ultimately being my own fault. Fandom helped me handle it better than I might have otherwise. But there was still a lot that I was missing and never got to learn. There were basic things, like volume control when talking, and countless smaller social skills, like how to apologize or how to ask for help. The only coping mechanisms I learned were aggression and running away. Since the later was rarely an option with her, I ended up primarily falling back on the former.\n\nI was close to my father, who died of cancer in February 2017. That same month, I also had to undergo surgery for a failing gall bladder. Things started to spiral and the situation got worse and worse until I was the one holding the household together. I couldn't handle it without my father though. In June, some friends helped me get away from her and move across the country. Despite my being 19, she accused me of running away and tried to get the cops to drag me back to her, claiming that her 'autism child' had been lured away by internet predators. We found out that she had me on so many unnecessary medications that it was essentially poisoning me. We fixed that and I rapidly began to get healthier on a physical level. I was definitely happier than I had been before.\n\nIt sounds like that should be it, happy ending, all good now. And I thought it would be. But it's not. I got angry at myself for not being able to shrug off everything that had happened within the first year. Even though I figured out how to live on my own, got a job, and even started college, I was frustrated by how hard so much was and how wrong so much of what I thought I knew was. It is *hard* to relearn nineteen years of misinformation and all but impossible to do so in one or even three. I cannot begin to verbalize how frustrating it is to know that something is wrong with you and not be able to push a button and make it all better instantly, to fall back into old behaviors and know, on some level, that you're falling back, but not yet having the skills to catch yourself and not being able to fix it after it's done.\n\nI also had a younger brother. He is a minor. When I got away from my mother's household, I left him behind. During what was already a bad week, I received a call. My mother had turned physically abusive and strangled him in the middle of the night while drunk. He lived, but she hit a wall and received a concussion when he punched her off him in self-defense. The police believed her when she said he attacked her. Charges were not pressed against my brother, but despite the efforts of myself and my extended family, he was put back into her custody after a few days. I was terrified that she was going to kill my brother and blamed myself for what happened and anything that might in the future. She wouldn't have attacked him if I was there for her to focus on. I was the one who left him behind to save myself. He probably even resented me for it. This caused me to spiral and decide to kill myself. And no, I didn't think it would cause your co-admin harm. I didn't think she would care, because in the middle of my spiral, I saw myself as a burden who people only pretended to care about out of pity. One who, in her own selfishness to live, might have gotten her little brother killed. I thought that I had made a mistake by not staying to take the hits for him. I hope that maybe if I killed myself, child services would have to look more seriously into the situation with my brother or mother. So no, I didn't think that what I was doing was bad or would hurt anyone. I thought that if I killed myself, I would be doing the right thing. I thought that people would be *happy*.\n\nThat was over six months ago now. Since then, I've gone through a bunch of assessments and finally started actively undergoing therapy. And progress is slow. It's exhausting. It's hard. But you don't get to say that I haven't grown or changed at all just because you haven't seen it from your experiences. You don't get to assume I'm not trying and give a condescending spiel when you know next to nothing about myself and my life. It is not your place to declare me a bad person and banished from the fandom. I know it would be easier if I were to just disappear for a few years and come back when I have everything under control, but for years, Pern has been the one constant in my life, and sometimes, when offline is difficult and complicated, it's nice to be able to log into something familiar and write. And no, I can't force people who don't want to interact with me to do so, nor should I try to. But it also isn't your place to say that I'm not welcome in the fandom and need to leave until I change, especially when I'm already trying to. I am trying to change. I am *trying* to grow and I *am* making progress. It is slow, and hard, and painful, and it isn't always in a straight line, but I am. But fandom, as wonderful as it can be, is also petty, grudge-holding, and unforgiving. What condemnations and accusations like yours do is get in the way of people getting another chance once they're more healed. And that makes people stop wanting to try altogether.\n\nI'm done posting in this thread.",
