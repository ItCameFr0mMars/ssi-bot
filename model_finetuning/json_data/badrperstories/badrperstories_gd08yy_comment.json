The reason why it invalidates their struggle is because a lot of people use mental health, orientation, disabilities, and the likes as a means to make most scenes about them. It's poor acting on their part because they are trying to harness a reaction that they don't fully understand.  \n\n\nFor instance, I have a heavily disabled friend. I would feel very uncomfortable roleplaying what she has in front of her because she has suffered with it her whole life, whereas I've just decided to turn it into a roleplay concept on the fly. It's a heavily situational ordeal. Make sure your moderators are okay with it and show that you've done the right research necessary to pull it off.   \n\n\nI don't think you should simply 'not care' and brush it off as people 'being offended'. If you knew people that have been through these things in their lives, I'm sure they'd tell you it isn't fun.",

I don't know you, but I'm playing devil's advocate here. Roleplay is an escape for a lot of people, so it's no surprise that some people don't like to see certain things roleplayed out. It might make the scenes not fun for them anymore because they are being made to read something that might be a reality to them or someone closer to them.   \n\n\nI'm glad you do your research, not many people do, particularly young roleplayers looking for a hook to give them a spotlight. And don't get me wrong, I don't think things should be off-limits to roleplay at all. In fact, it's important to have representation of all different kinds of people in media. But usually if someone isn't comfortable seeing something, there's a reason behind it. Either via you not being respectful, or the fact that it hits closer to home than you might intend. Roleplay should be a fun union between people that love to write, not a situation where you make the other writer feel apprehensive.   \n\n\nThe bottom line is you will find some people that are fine with it, and others which aren't. But those people that aren't okay with it shouldn't be belittled for their feelings on the matter. You never know what folks are going through.",

I only recently started to branch out to play genders other than my own, and gay relationships, because I didn\u2019t feel like I could, but I think it feels great because when you get into a character, it\u2019s not you, they\u2019re their own person. If somebody has a character with OCD or ADHD, things I have and I feel it\u2019s inaccurate, I would rather just talk to them about how they could approach it differently. If they do autistic, I would give them my experiences, because I know people with it that I\u2019m rather close to, so I would love to help. If it\u2019s something I don\u2019t know about, then I just stand with them all the way, and say I discover something new I would definitely tell them. Please don\u2019t feel discouraged to do a character with a physical or mental disability, or one of LGBTQ or of a different race, that\u2019s what writing is all about, making a character, and learning along the way.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve seen a few arguments in here about being considerate, not playing it properly, etc. I have mostly noticed that reasonable people of these communities usually want some kind of proper portrayal. \n\n1. Disabled people. My bf has one arm, and when we\u2019ve discussed shitty books in the past, he has pointed out that I should attempt to write about it. We don\u2019t think I\u2019d be better suited than an actually disabled writer, but the point is never to be the most qualified, it\u2019s to have fun. He thinks my portrayal would be, on average, a better one. \n\nHowever,\n\n2. Orphans. I see both sides with this one. Part of me wants to say that I would probably genuinely cry if I RPed with someone who wrote a well made orphan character. My mom is dead and I have never met my dad. Everyone I have ever roleplayed with has had orphan characters, and it\u2019s actually really shitty feeling. I ended an RP over a first post where they said her girl was \u201cquirky\u201d and lived alone because her parents are dead, but she\u2019s overall just fine. 99% of the time it\u2019s to write off the inconvenience of the presence of parents. \n\nThe worst case was when a friend of mine literally, somehow forgot. Or just did not put 2 and 2 together. We were creating new characters and their character\u2019s dad had died, and their mom was away on business because they just didn\u2019t care about them. They were econsidering changing the genders. We were roleplaying serial killers, and, I paraphrase, bug \u201csomeone with a dead parent and someone who doesn\u2019t care about them is just more likely to do that kind of thing.\u201d I think I asked if they were trolling and then didn\u2019t talk to them for like a week. \n\nThe thing is, a lot of these situations can be unintentionally commenting on people\u2019s real life, and that should be considered. My example is a reeeeally offensive example of that, but sometimes when you\u2019re dissecting a character and their motives because they\u2019re trans or something, it\u2019s like commenting on someone\u2019s real life, and some people are trying to be conscious of the fact that the affected people are not there to be witness of it, which is quite dumb, but I understand. I don\u2019t give a shit if someone decides to Roleplay an edge lord orphan, but I don\u2019t really want to hear about it. \n\nOne example I can think of is dealing with homophobia. I love conflict in an RP, and glorifying conflict, so those kind of scenes would be a little problematic if I were playing with, say, my middle school friend whose gay uncle got lynched. Not cool. \n\nObviously, these things aren\u2019t happening to you. If I were talking to you, and you asked about triggers or issues, I\u2019d probably say \u201cno cancer\u201d and then if, for examples sake, you played an offensive orphan, I\u2019d be super polite when I ghosted the RP. No hard feelings, common occurrence. If I felt strongly about hanging out with you and rping in the future, I\u2019d probably just say \u2018hey let\u2019s not do that\u2019 and move to another rp, as anyone should who has issue with what group you decide to portray. \n\nPoliteness is always always best. No need to be rude about this stuff. Sorry for long winded reply, hoping for another perspective.",
