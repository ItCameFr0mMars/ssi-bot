Initially, you have enough to wander the overworld and that's it. Once you get closer to the end, you can do more, assign items to certain buttons based on your play style, etc.\n\n\"Low effort\" characters can build off their experiences and grow with the amount of time you use them. \"No Effort\" characters, like the static, carbon-copy canon clones we all hear too much about, are the only characters that might be worth getting a jettison into a black hole. Don't put yourself off RP just because you are inexperienced. If you enjoy it, focus on getting better, maybe try new tropes, or rethink a previous character. \n\nOr, since I rather enjoy analogies: Work towards defeating yourself as the final boss.",
