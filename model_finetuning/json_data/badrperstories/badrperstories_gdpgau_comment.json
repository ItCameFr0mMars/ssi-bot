Not that you're one, but most fandom ocs will be. I for one don't fandom rp with ocs because of this, especially since many series have speculation on the logic of certain in-series events that may lead to severe disagreements on what is and isn't \"fair\" so to speak. Which leads me into my next point.\n\nFandom rp also means you need to be on the same page. It's very easy to accidentally spoil something if your partner is behind and vice versa, and sometimes your oc will have potentially spoiled aspects to them depending on what they are. This is also a huge turn off.\n\nFinally, some people just don't want ocs. Nobody wants to hear this, but often we are biased to think our OCs are better and more interesting than they really are. This especially applies to fandom ocs, most people would rather just have canon characters interact because, in honesty, they have already had time to appreciate these characters.\n\nI hope this doesn't feel too critical, I just wanted to clarify the probable reasons you're having trouble-it's no fault of your own, just an unfortunate set of aspects that make semi-canon rp so niche.",

Not only Mary Sues, but also Ocs who do not fit the tone of the story at all. The most common example for this is a super depressed OC in a comedy story, I encountered that so many times, even if the focus on mental health/sad topics does not fit the tone of original story at all.\n\nBut I believe that the main reason for this is that most fandom rps focus on shipping, and well, many people prefer shipping fandom characters together and are not interested in anyone else. If they write Frodo, they want Sam for him, so there is no reason for them to give any OC 'a chance'. No matter how developed your OC might be, or if the focus is romance or not. No way to change that I guess. I get that it can be frustrating.",

If everyone is playing a character they made themselves, there's a bigger chance for everyone to be on a more or less equal footing. \n\nOnly downside with that is that everyone believes that they're the main character and want all the attention on a character they understandably may be proud of. No situation is fool proof unfortunately, and there's a myriad of other problems that go with either mixture in my experience. \n\n\nAlso on the topic of bad names and characters being related to canon characters: there was an oc I saw posted in an NSFW star wars server who, along with being the brother to luke and leia, was called *Akira Skywalker*.",

            "body": "Heey, this is something I know a lot about! \n\nGood characters, like good stories, are hard to make from scratch. They take effort, skill, thought, inspiration, possibly research, aaall that. So, as with anything that's hard to make, ninety percent of OCs you'll encounter aren't very good at all. But this isnt't exclusive to OCs; this is true for canon character interpretations, too! A looot of them are gonna be bad. \n\nThe difference, I think, is that even bad canon character interpretations already have a premade, invested audience from the original material. So, they're likely to get partners regardless. Meanwhile, OCs in canon-friendly fandom spaces have to do a lot more work to get people invested; they're new and unfamiliar, and therefore have way more to prove. So, when they're bad, people tend to notice more. That's where the reputation comes from. I don't think it's fair, but it happens.\n\nSo, even if your OCs are good, you have a muuuch steeper hill to scale and you have to be more persistent, active and patient. It's often not your fault. It's just that people tend to gravitate towards what they already know and like!\n\nPS: I think it's important to note that a developed backstory does not an engaging character make on its own, especially in an RP setting. Your character has to be interesting *as they are* before most people will care about where they came from. This is why we often learn a character's full background *later* in a story; we want to get to know them as we get to know people on the street, first! Hell, one of the most popular OCs I knew was well-liked because he was an interdimensional therapist who got into other characters' business. We never learned his backstory! All the writer did was make sure there was a present, in-RP reason to care about what their character was up to, and it usually involved interest in other people's characters.",
