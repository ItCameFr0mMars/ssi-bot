The next time I roleplayed (the instance in which I began a consecutive affair and search for roleplay which has lasted until today), I was 16. I was part of a group of what I perceived of as adults and thus, hid my age. Years later, we got together to VC and play some games, leading to the realisation that we were all of varying ages between 14-18 at the time of our inception. \n\nPeople online are younger than you think.

Except I started on the Warriors rps, not with human characters, so that probably protected me for a bit.  I didn't start doing mildly sexual rp until I was 12-ish and starting puberty, so it proceeded at a rate I was comfortable with and with partners who were close to my age.\n\nYou must have been playing before I started, though, since I played after the days of dial-up and the time had long since passed that shit like that wouldn't be deleted instantly.  You couldn't even say \"kiss\" without spelling it like k!$$.",
