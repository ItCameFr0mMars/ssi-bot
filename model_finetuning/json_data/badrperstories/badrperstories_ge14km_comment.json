And even if they leave, don't forget that now that you've developed your character, you can try taking them and putting them into a brand new roleplay.  But for now, if you're still really frustrated, sometimes it's fun to do other roleplay-related media.  I still do this when my long-term writing partner is busy or not in the mood.  I draw art of the characters, make little videos, think up plots, work on other \"flavor texts\" to fill out my characters' backstories and motivations.  Best of luck!",

            "body": "Bit of a late response, and startingly similar to what other people have said, but the short answer is: wait.\n\nLong answer, however, is to be honest with your partner about your feelings. I've had a few partners I geled with extremely well throughout my tenure of writing, and I can tell you that any time something cropped up that made me anxious or unhappy and I just bottled it up rather than addressing my partner about why I was feeling this way outright, both of us ultimately suffered much more in the longrun. Me, by not seeking resolution on the source of those negative feelings, and my partner, who, often not understanding why I was acting the way I was, assumed they had done something to negatively impact our writing or personal relationship.\n\nTalk to your partner. Send them a message. Though they might not immediately respond, there's a chance they'll read it. As a writer, there's little that grates me more - personally/as someone who's muse is very fickle - than feeling as though I'm being rushed. So, I wouldn't make that a focus. Just reiterate how much you enjoy the scenes/characters you've built together, but let them know how difficult the sharp change in pace has been for you. See how they're doing. Don't press for a return to form, but show that you're invested in their wellbeing beyond their investment in your writing by just checking in with how they're doing/feeling. You might not expect it, but just knowing how your partner's feeling or handling things under the circumstances of a major world event like this can bring you a lot of closure. My main partner has dropped in and out of three different hiatuses since Covid began, and I'd honestly wait months for her because our writing means that much to me.\n\nAs an aside, five days isn't that long. Though that's more the perspective of someone who themselves can go one or two weeks between responses just because of mental drain. I might be working rather than studying atm, but what I've heard from a few friends who have to turn in online assignments and attend classes via Zoom is that it's been brutal-- try and empathize with your partner on that. It's a big adjustment for them.",
