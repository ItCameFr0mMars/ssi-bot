Not to mention we roleplay \u201coff the wall\u201d things that are hard to come by, let alone execute because a lot of people just simply cannot fill the writing prompts of anything but Slice of Life - which I\u2019m a fan of, but I enjoy angst and dark characters/scenarios as much as the next person. To say I miss them, and the games, is an understatement.\n\nFeel free to feel hurt by it and vent here, because honestly it\u2019s a hurtful feeling. \n\nBut, also feel free to reach out to me if you\u2019re ever looking for another partner.

I was writing a fun saga with a partner whose writing I adored, but then this whole pandemic happened (stupid pandemic) and she got too bogged down by job and life-stuff to keep going. Which I get, obviously -- some folks are even MORE drawn to escapism and roleplay (like me) in times like these, whereas others don't have the energy for it.\n\nI was fortunate enough to find another amazing partner around the same time, and we're still going strong. But the thought does cross my mind that these things can be finite, and partners might just bail on you without warning. It sucks. One thing I've been meaning to try are shorter, one-off scenes, just so I can try out a variety of potential partners without as much of an investment. If someone clicks well, great, then maybe you develop something with them. But the energy and frustration of trying to find a long-term partner over and over again can be exhausting, so maybe shorter, more self-contained scenes could be a fun way to indulge the writing bug without all the hassle.",
