Keep in mind that most role players have depression, it's arguably why we write to begin with - needing an escape. Maybe they didn't ghost you so much as they've collectively fallen into a slump of their own. I'd argue that it's very possible that with them potentially going through that, it might be a trigger for them to be around someone who is also going through that. While it's hard, we can't begrudge them for taking the time to tend to their own self-care and needs.   \n\n\nI run a small server myself and I see a lot of my players are going through some rough times. This quarantine is like steroids for our inner demons, sadly. But if you'd like to just talk sometime, my inbox is open to you.   \n\n\nBest wishes &lt;3",
