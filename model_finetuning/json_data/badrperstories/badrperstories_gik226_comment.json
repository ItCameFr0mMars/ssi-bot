I'm more interested in a reciprocation of interest than using her 100 times with 100 different people.\n\nAt the end of the day, if it seems like there's a lot of unnecessary \"fluff\" -  that's your/their opinion. My OC, whether she's one page, or 6 pages, is an investment of my free time. What is \"essential\" or interesting to one person, might not be to another. No one can force you to read what you don't want to, but as the person who worked hard on *this OC*, I don't think it's unreasonable to be disappointed when people don't read. Whether disappointment was to be expected is something else entirely.\n\nLong docs can be daunting, but *short* docs can grueling to get through sometimes too. Some people can make a nuanced OC in a page, some can't. Regardless of length, if I have little to no intent to pay attention when looking at their character, how do I plan on RPing against them? Why wouldn't I keep looking for a character that *can* hold my attention all the way instead?\n\nI know the doc is long. People RP with all different styles and attention to detail, literacy, etc. This is how I like it. If I offer too much or too little for what you want, to each their own, but respect the effort I did bring and either choose to **attempt** to return that or respectfully look elsewhere for someone who *does* match your style.",
