I have provided writing examples as well. I added that I also want good grammar and only a few mistakes because otherwise, it would be really hard to understand what they just wrote. I made mistakes too, like everyone else, but at least I put effort into my replies. When I sent them more then 500 words, they only gave me five lines in response and that in a span of five minutes, while I took over twenty minutes to reply to them. In those five lines, they often had over 10 errors.\n\n\nI haven't told them how much I disliked their character for acting like a helpless little bitch despite being described differently in their wiki while they basically screamed at me that my character was shit for not abusing, degrading and fucking theirs. They have not respected my boundaries and rules, they haven't respected my character and they haven't respected me and despite that, I have tried to be polite to them for several hours. The roleplay didn't last longer than a day. I have anger issues, so, I'm surprised that I was able to tolerate them for so long in the first place.\n\n\nDepression and cutting, as well as male pregnancy, were my triggers. I have made that clear in my wiki. I have attempted suicide before, I have cut and someone else writing about it always makes me sick and self-conscious. Still, they wrote about it without telling me that they would, although I should have expected that since the communication wasn't that important to them anyway. Male pregnancy made me incredibly uncomfortable, especially because I am asexual. \n\n\nBut maybe I'm just being close-minded. Please do enlighten me. How am I being an elitist ass here?",

Then there's the bits saying that your character is purely vanilla, but then you also consented to playing him in a Master/slave mechanic which is the farthest from vanilla you can get. That tells me you were sending some mixed signals yourself.   \n\n\nIt could just be the wording, but it does sound like gate-keeping elitism which is something our community has suffered from over all.   \n\n\nYour boundaries are all valid, albeit not terribly relevant to *this* conversation. It's totally fine to pull away from a writing partner that doesn't respect them. But it reads a little like you were initially claiming they were a bad role player purely for not matching your length which is blatantly elitist. Role players come with all variations of writing styles. You're well within your rights to stop a story if someone's writing style doesn't match or inspire yours, but it's in the fact that you've *counted* how many words you send and then you *counted* how many \"lines\" he sends back that makes you elitist. It's like it's not about the story for you, so much as it's about your ability to flex on other writers. That's toxic, pure and simple.",

I wanted to avoid confusion. And I'm not holding it over my partner's head whatsoever. They said that they could easily write as much as that and then only hit me with five lines that had around five to ten words after the thirst three messages. \n\n\nAnd I never said that my character was made for this type of roleplay. They wanted a master/slave type of thing and this happened years ago. During that time, I was pretty much a people pleaser and wanted them to enjoy it, so I agreed. It was also more a master/butler type of thing (at least that is what I was going for back then) because the fellow was getting paid and all that jazz. My character was still gentle and kind man, treating the people who worked for him as equals which was something my WP complained about because they wanted abuse and things that are similar to that. Which was something I wasn't comfortable with. And I had told them that before we started roleplaying. It was my condition for doing this. They said they were okay with that.\n\n\nAnd I am not saying that they were a bad roleplayer for not matching my length?? While that was one of the points, they have literally forced themselves onto my character multiple times and mentioned several things I am not comfortable with, plus they also tried to change several things and attempted to control my character which was something I did not want. Not to mention that they lied about their age. They told me that they were of legal age (roleplaying with minors isn't all that legal) and meanwhile they were a kid. I mentioned that somewhere at the end. And I didn't count anything. I write my responses in word documents and there you can literally see how many words you write. And I always copied and pasted their replies to word so that I didn't have to switch to the app every single time. I am not \"flexing\" on anyone. I know that there are people out there who are much better than me and write much more than me. Their length wasn't even the point of this post but go off mate. \n\n\nHave a decent day.",
