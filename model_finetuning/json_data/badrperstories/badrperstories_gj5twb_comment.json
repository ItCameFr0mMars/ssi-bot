I am curious if you ever spoke ooc to the two \u201cbad\u201d writers about their style and how they could improve (if they truly needed to.)",

They didn't capitalize some things or had minor spelling errors, but they were competent writers.  Other members were just as \"bad\" grammatically, but never faced the Writing Class or got called out on it because they were friends with the admins and other popular members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became friends with the two bad writers after I interacted with them because they were actually nice to me.  The forum had an independent chatroom feature and accounts that were character only.  Most of the people didn't know I was my character because we were so different, so after I got to know the \"bad\" writers, I started stories with them and they were highly imaginative and responsive.  Once they realized my character wasn't hostile to theirs and it was a good give and take, their writing practices improved because they wanted to make it cohesive.  More spellcheck and grammar corrections.",
