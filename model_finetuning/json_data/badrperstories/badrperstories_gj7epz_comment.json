            "body": "Yeah, no. That is not going to work out. You can't have a good roleplay if your partner does not really get involved. I would get replying with 'I have no other ideas/ I have nothing to add' if he would wholeheartedly agree with the ideas you present to him (even though I would still find it a little annoying if he NEVER adds anything). But bashing your ideas while not adding anything himself? Lazy and entitled as fuck. \n\nThis person sees you as someone who provides entertainment for them (with the rp being like a game he has bought and therefore can criticize heavily when he encounters something he does not like), but roleplaying is group project which needs both roleplayers to work together. Ask yourself this question: you are always making sure he is having fun, to invent little events which will make the rp more interesting for him, and so on. Has he ever made sure that YOU are enjoying the storylines you write together? Because I don't think so. It seems like you are bending over backwards to please him and he is just like 'Nah, I don't feel doing anything for it.'\n\nSo no, you are not overreacting. People like that are draining your energy (no matter how nice this person is when it comes to other stuff). There are three approaches: you address the problem again, and if he denies it/tells you you are overreacting and does not want to change anything you leave. Or you don't add any of your own ideas anymore and slowly watch it fade out. Or you tell him your rp does not work out and quit writing with him.\n\nHowever, my own experience has thought me that this type of roleplayer rarely changes.",

But, I am making a new \"chapter\" for this story, so this is to hoping that this will work out. Other than that, it'll suck to see it die out quickly.\nReally appreciate your response, it made me feel more confident in my own thoughts about this whole thing. :)",
