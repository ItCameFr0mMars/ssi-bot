In fact, I'd even go the extra mile and just plain ask him if he's not having fun, because the on-lines are killing you, which negates the fun for you as well. This hobby is supposed to be fundamentally enjoyable for the players, so if that's not happening, something needs to be fixed. \n\nWho knows, you both might need to be put out from your miseries by just amicably ending the RP. Good luck, hope it turns out for the best!",
