It was horrific and nobody should ever have to deal with people like that but at least you know now what to do if it ever happens again. You know all the red flags to watch out for and most importantly of all, you know not to let anybody ever emotionally manipulate, blackmail or threaten you. Under any circumstances. No matter how much you may or may not care about that person.\u00a0\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I'm sincerely sorry you had to go through that ordeal. She certainly did give you hell and it must have been a very traumatic experience. On the other hand, I'm delighted that you didn't let her prevent you from enjoying this hobby. I hope you've healed from this. \ud83e\udd8b",
