They were out of line to call you out like that. That was definitely rude of them. But they're not *completely* incorrect in that mid-conversation, if you have to go afk, it's polite to let them know.   \n\n\nIn general, communication is always key. Even if it's listed in your ads, even if they read it all the way through, you have to assume they're reading multiple ads a day and might not remember every little thing said in each one. It's always best to reiterate it and keep communication open to minimize this level of drama.",

This guy seriously needs to work on their behavior, but I think I see the place they\u2019re coming from. I hope they learn eventually that nobody needs to tell you anything about what they\u2019re doing and that seven minutes is not a long time to wait for a text response. I hope they teach themselves how to assume the best, you know? Tell yourself that your partner got interrupted by a family member, had to leave suddenly for, say, work and will be back later, or, oh, I don\u2019t know...maybe they got up to make a sandwich. It helps when you get well-practiced in assuming they\u2019re doing literally anything except intentionally ignoring you.",
