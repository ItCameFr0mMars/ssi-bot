Which came to a balanced rp, if we don\u2019t know what to do with one we speak up and talk about it, because all four of our ocs do interact with each other, (we got more than four, but they are the main). I think what needs to be done here is to be able to discuss this with your partner and see what you can do, because not always will your oc be with their SO they also need to interact with other characters to shape them, to have friends, otherwise it will get boring if the two are constantly together. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a must, I think take away what you feel is necessary from this.",
