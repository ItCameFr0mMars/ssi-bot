It adds absolutely nothing new to the story or the character. \n\nEspecially if this person writes YOUR character's reaction, it is time to call them out on it. That is just a bad writing style, not a preference. No one wants this to be done to their character. If you wanted them to stare, you write it in your replies. You are not to critical. \n\nMaybe think about what your main concern is. Perhaps you can live with their NPCs drooling over their character, but draw the line at your own character's reaction?",

But your problem is far less serious, especially if they are parts of the rp that you like and she seems like a good writer (if you don't take your issues into account). \n\nFrom reading your replies and comments I get the idea that she maybe is willing to introduce romance/more erotic scenes, but she has no idea how to introduce this. Maybe it would be a could idea to talk about what direction both of you want to go? Are you open to this? Then you might try to offer other ways to include this in the rp without her trying to force the 'right' reaction from your character. (I know your character does not really care about things like that, but maybe they are other possibilities to attract his interest?)\n\nIf you address your issue, make sure that she does not get the impression that you hate her writing style or the rp in general. I would also include stuff you like about it.",

            "body": "That was definitely crossing a line and it was the right thing to do to cut it completely. Also pretty strange...\n\nReally good advice! One detail - I probably should've mentioned in my post - is that she already tried to introduce romantic scenes but it was too early for me (I like build-up) so my character turned it down. The plot continued to move forward in a more platonic direction but she doubled down on the \"sexy\" descriptions. So it is starting to feel like she is trying to force the 'right' reaction, as you said. Unfortunately I probably would have been open to it at first until this became an issue.\n\nI guess what I'm learning from your advice and other comments is that 1) this is a common problem and 2) the only way out is to communicate, even if it gets awkward. Thank you for your insight!",

            "body": "It sounds like she is definitely digging for that reaction from your character and is basically giving you multiple \"openings\" for your OC to have a moment of \"Fuck she's so hot.\" that she's craving.\n\nI think if the two people ooc are in agreement about what type of mood is happening in an RP then there's not a problem with some of what she's doing, but it sounds like you already told her you and your OC weren't going to respond in the way she's seeking.\n\nI think it might be time for a careful talk ooc about this. Open with the godmodding to tell her that she can't ever describe your character's actions without asking you first, then use that the segue into talking about how you find it distracting to have such a narrative focus on how stunning and hot her OC is all the time, and you'd like for that to be toned down. Give direct instructions and examples, like: \n\n\"I think having NPCs commenting so often on how hot your OC is/drooling over her is distracting and it pulls me out of the scene entirely and makes it harder for me to have my OC act natural and want to engage with yours. \n\nSometimes the sexual focus on how she drinks water or things like that reads more like it's meant for the start of a smut scene than platonic RP, so I think it might be good if we could tone that down and save that sort of energy for later moments for if they ever end up together. Currently I feel like all the 'romantic' and 'sexual' energy is being depleted little by little before we even start it up.\"",
