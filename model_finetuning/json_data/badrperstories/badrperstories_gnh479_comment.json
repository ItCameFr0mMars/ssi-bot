Also, if I point out everytime they do something like this, then it'll begin to carry less weight so when something trully horrendous rears it's ugly head my words will no longer have the pull hey would've had.\n\nI have had words with them before though, and they are trying atleast. In fact, I had talked to them about how when I design characters I always bear in mind 'the more powerful a character is the more limits should be in place to maintain balance' so I'm fairly certain Cat's inability to actually control and use most his powers is them trying to place limits on him.",

Though honestly if it's *that* often that it worries you I'd likely just go find a new partner.\n\nIf  you like and respect him enough that you want to keep him as your writing partner I feel like it's implied that you both should be able to talk to each other respectfully and calmly about issues that might arise in the RP. That means a serious talk where things aren't hinted at, but are instead laid out plainly with no confusion.\n\n\"I feel like Cat is overpowered and is making it hard to enjoy this RP. I feel this way because \\[reasons\\], can we talk about how to fix this problem and maybe do some retcons on the powers? I'd also like it if you would take an even hand in creating plots for our characters to move through.\"\n\nYou know? Imagine if your writing partner had a problem with your writing and they never talked to you about it straight, and then you found out they had been posting about you negatively online to others before rolling back in to write with you again later that night as though there were no concerns.
