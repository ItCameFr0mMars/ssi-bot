The other persons character, they kept doing it even though we told them to stop, we eventually just decided to ignore them but they would yell at the character who was their friend. (I forgot to say that they role play in first person pov) soon we had the characters go on a date and the person wasn\u2019t even there for a half hour after the date had started and suddenly, flew faster then the fastest tribe in the whole book series towards the restaurant they thought the characters were eating at, and was yelling at their friend getting mad at us when we were ignoring them even though it was a date between the two characters, eventually she got the hint and had her character leave after she wrote she heard them laughing on the other side of the street.\n\nSorry if it sounds weird this is my first time telling people who were in the chat about what happened.",

            "body": "Your story reminds me a lot of my early days in rp. I had a super cringe vampire character who was so saddened by life and you could not see him for the cloud of darkness that surrounded him constantly because he was so goddamn emo. A true edgelord character. One time this character was being all emo in his usual emo ways and then two elves jumped into the scene and started going on about how wonderful life was. We asked them OOC if it wouldn't be better to find another place for their happy moment and luckily they understood. That was more of a \"read the group chat before you post a funny meme while someone is talking about their troubles\" moment. I hate remembering this emo character though, he was everything we hate about edgelord characters.\n\nYou should definitely share more stories if you have them!",

            "body": "I have one more about another person on Instagram who would always make ships with me and would have the dragons have an egg the first day they meant, well eventually I wanted to make ships with other peoples oc\u2019s, and the thing about this girl is when someone new had just entered the rp chat she would be the first person to message them asking for a ship, and she would abandoned her other ships, getting mad if you decided to have your character ship with someone else\u2019s while they were in a ship with her\u2019s. Eventually I told her I wanted to do a build up and one day she found out I was in a fantribe chat and joined I had just made a new character his name was Cosmic and she had made a female named Star, I was the only person she knew in the chat and she asked if we could do a ship. I agreed but said that they were going to build up she said fine, well here\u2019s the thing the fantribe oc\u2019s has powers and ranks, cosmic was important in the kingdom because he could turn things into gold so he was locked up in the tower for almost his whole life, and she had her oc be a servant and claimed that her oc knew all about Cosmic because she was friends with the queen which makes no scene to me, anyway at first I decided to have Cosmic act like a jerk because of how he was raised and she didn\u2019t like it and told me I had to change his attitude if I wanted the ship to work, I agreed but not for her but because I didn\u2019t like how he was either. (Now he\u2019s a love able idiot), when they meant again she tried to get them to have an egg in private chat, I said no and replied in the main chat and I believe someone knew what happened because they asked me in private chat, eventually they escaped and I came up with a plot with someone else with Cosmic and their oc\u2019s where he would have an enchantment put on him, she did not like that plot and message the owner of the fantribe saying to take the necklace off cosmic so they could continue ship, we both told her no since it was my character, and eventually she stopped role playing in the chat because I lost interest in role playing with star.\n\n(Forgot to mention that they were in a tree in the woods, so legend has it Star is still asleep in the woods a year later, and Cosmic is enjoying a single life)",
