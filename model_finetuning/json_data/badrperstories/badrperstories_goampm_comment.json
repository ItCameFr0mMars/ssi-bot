I myself have a similar experience, (it was last year, we were on a rp app called Geeking, got to know each other, i figure we could even be good rp buds/companions.) Until my rp partner did that (and yes even i was super uncomfortable) with the \u2018sucking of feet/toes\u2019. Because i guess they are one who likes to do that kind of stuff. To me or my rp character, (ooc mainly) and it\u2019s just... idk how to describe it. I did mention it to them though, about that it made me real uncomfortable, and their response ( which i think i even screenshotted) was something along the lines of, \u2018i wouldn\u2019t do anything that would make you uncomfortable, i just wish that you would be willing to accept it.\u2019 or whatever. Uh, no. No, because it just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nApologies for the long post, but if you need anything to say, vent or anything then feel free. Im always here and hoping to make some new friends and i hope we can be.",

Still, glad it eventually did stop.

And I only really speak to the dude occasionally now, there's other odd things that happened but this was the peak of it. So it's okay at the moment lmao. And honestly, I really don't get all that sort of fetish stuff either- Of course hey, do whatever you wanna do, you ain't hurting anyone so totally do it- but I just will never get it. Sure I can see like... some of them, but like... a foot fetish? I just hate feet a lot so I can NEVER eVER understand it. \n\nAnd honestly, I'm so down for that! I'm currently looking for some new people to rp with, along with some new people to chat with and be friends with, so I could totally dm you and we can talk more! Whatever you'd like!",
