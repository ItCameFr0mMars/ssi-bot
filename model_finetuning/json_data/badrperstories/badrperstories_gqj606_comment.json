One, if one person has less or significantly less characters, they need to be just as active in the plot as pretty much all of the other characters combined. Both players basically need even agency. \n\nAs far as a responsibility to, basically, keep the chatter down, I agree that it needs to at least be under control or kept efficient. Sometimes, I want to have a subplot between my side characters or have a conversation between my characters that doesn\u2019t involve my partner\u2019s characters, sometimes even when they\u2019re completely absent. I think it is good etiquette to keep that conversation short and clipped. I rarely summarize conversations in my writing, but I might even say things like \u201cThey had a little small talk before Alex decided he needed to bring up the elephant in the room\u201d or whatever it is. \n\nI also probably would never make it more than 1 or 2 posts. Only 2+ if my partner also had something very specific they wanted their character to do during the \u2018break\u2019. \n\nIf the person who isn\u2019t involved has to do the equivalent of \u201cCasey continued to get ready for bed and eventually sleep\u201d over and over, that\u2019s really really bad etiquette haha.

            "body": "I think it really depends on the context and the type of roleplay. For example, I'm doing a one-on-one RP with a partner, going on 6 months now. We were playing out a big dinner party scene where I happened to be operating four of the characters involved, and my partner was mostly just playing the one (with another side character only marginally involved). And yet it worked out well, because while I'd have my characters talk and interact with one another, I'd always bring it back to her character for some kind of reaction/rebuttal.\n\nI think that's really the crux of it -- making sure your partner is included. Whether they're playing one character or several, give them something to DO or respond to. But I think you could theoretically play any number of characters as long as you kept circling back around to your partner.\n\nFWIW, she did love the scene and thanked me afterwards for taking on so much during it in terms of the writing. But I loved it too, because it was fun letting my characters interact with one another so I could throw in lots of banter and repartee. However, from the get-go I would often do short scenes/snippets of my characters talking/interacting with each other to help fill in the blanks for what's going on, outside of their interaction with hers. It's just another kind of collaborative writing, but seems to work well for us!",
