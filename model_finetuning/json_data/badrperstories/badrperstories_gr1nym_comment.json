            "body": "We've seen this a lot in our group. Most of the time, when someone can't help but talk about their personal life, it's because they are a minor. In fact, I'd wager almost every single time it's happened to us, it has been a teenager posing as 18+. (We are an 18+ group).   \n\n\nI personally feel like people who cry about their personal life in roleplay groups (when it isn't warranted) are quite rude. I get it, people are going through shit... but roleplay is a form of escape for most people. It's incredibly uncomfortable for the rest of the group if they have to read it. There's a time and place, and inside of a writing group usually isn't it. It's one thing if someone asked you a question that's a little sensitive, but it's another thing to constantly try and harvest sympathy.   \n\n\nWe tend to boot those people from the group straight away because they are either teenagers or attention seekers. If you have a real life issue, you should talk to an individual you trust in private, where it's more genuine and controlled. Not force a whole group to read something they probably don't want to be involved in because they are using roleplay to escape their problems.",
