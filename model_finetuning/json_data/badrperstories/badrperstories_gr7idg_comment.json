Everyone now gets a fake name, no one knows where I really live, I give people fake job titles. I was 13 the first time a man stalked me online while role-playing on a site for children called ChickenSmoothie. We only roleplayed on the site and I never gave out my information but after he found out I was female, he claimed to be about my age, he made multiple accounts to talk to me after he made me uncomfortable and I told him and tried to block him. I would get death threats on a SITE FOR CHILDREN.   \n\n\nI've had two more incidents that are similar to this and I'm in my 20's now, I'm still paranoid that some of the people who message me for roleplay are going to make multiple accounts and harass me everywhere. All of them were men. One of them found my social media because I posted something with one of my birds to the discord chat and then also to my social media account, keep in mind I didn't send him a link to my social media I simply uploaded the same picture from my phone, which was public at the time. Didn't even think you could do that. I've never had this issue with women, I've never had this issue with any nonheterosexual man or any trans or ENBY person.   \n\n\nI do get men that message me for roleplay or they decide to \"omit\" their gender in their first message to me and when I ask what it is and find out they are in fact a cis male, they flip out because \"What does it matter what gender I am?\"   \n\n\nDo what makes you feel comfortable, you have a right to your boundaries especially in a hobby you are not being paid for. This isn't a job, you are doing something for your enjoyment and you should do it only with people you enjoy.",

You're not a government entity and you have every right not to roleplay (or even chat with) people you don't want to roleplay with. Legally, end of story.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of someone who hangs out on r/Roleplay and occasionally finds play partners there, I find that I avoid any and all posts that mention an unwillingness to play with one gender. I'm female so often the posts aren't even excluding me specifically, but knowing that the person is excluding a gender from their search is enough to be a turn-off. I will generally not reply to those.\n\nMy thought when I see posts like this is two-fold:\n\n* First, the gender of the character and the gender of the player rarely line up in my roleplays and the gender of the player rarely, if ever, comes up.\n* I've roleplayed with people of various genders and have had a good time. To think that some of my friends are being excluded because of gender alone is... disheartening to say the least.\n\nAll that said, this is your story and your ideas and your safety on the line, so you have to do what's right for you.
