It sounded fun enough; we were going to rp characters from a certain fandom, but we could also make OCs for that fandom if we wanted to.\n It started off fairly well with everyone interacting, though it was a rough start. After a while, the main dude added a friend of his and from then on, treated it like a 1 on 1 rp. They roleplayed a ship from the fandom and did fetish stuff like mpreg even though we said no sexual stuff beforehand since some of us were minors (myself included). \nThe main dude was in his late twenties so it was pretty creepy. He also tried making us rp as other characters from the fandom and I didn\u2019t really want to as I didn\u2019t know where that would lead with him. \nFor a while, I felt like I was the only one putting effort into it as it was a gc and not a sexual 1 on 1 thing. The other people weren\u2019t trying to interact with anyone and I was left here trying to string along a weak plot as the lovebirds kept talking about their future baby. After watching the gc struggle more, I left. I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with everything happening. \nI usually hate ghosting, but this kind of stuff just isn\u2019t okay. If you\u2019re not going to interact with the others, why be in the gc? And if you\u2019re going to completely disregard the things you discussed with the others beforehand just to be horny in the rp, why do you expect us to join in?",
