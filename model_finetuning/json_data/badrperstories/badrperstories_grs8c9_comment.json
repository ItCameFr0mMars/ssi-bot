When inspiration hits, I can hit more than 1 or 2 paragraphs. honestly as long as it's not a one or two word reply, and it has detail, personally it's enough for me.",

Half the time, those words don't appear to mean the same thing to them as they do to me. Perhaps they've lost all meaning? \n\nHere are some lovely pet peeves of mine:\n\n* Writing several paragraphs (or even pages) of what appears to be nonsense. The words are strung together into sentences, but the sentences say nothing. \n* Alternatively, another joy to read are characters who appear to have no physical traits whatsoever. They don't smile, blush, blink, cringe, or move in any way under any circumstances, so there's nothing to react to and you're left imagining a faceless mannequin where a person ought to be. \n* Intermingling first- and third-person narratives into one post. Or fluidly switching between past tense and present tense.\n* Long posts that include speech (usually more than one person doing the speaking) all in one paragraph.\n\nTo help counter this, I've honestly stopped asking for advanced literacy. During the prep and negotiation, when this inevitably comes up, I ask that they write using as many or as few words as needed to get their point across. I also send them a writing sample and hope they get the point of what we're all dealing with.\n\nMy favorite roleplay partners (and I'm lucky to have met quite a few) are those who love reading and writing outside of RP. I find they're well above and beyond anything I could ever expect and I love it!",

I immensely appreciate it when the other player takes the time to have their character inwardly react to or address their own thoughts in relation to the actions and things I've described.\n\nIf it's just a talking scene the paragraphs range from maybe 3 small sized paragraphs.

It makes me imagine the VATS sound effect from Fallout each time they describe their 'optics' moving. Also orbs. Where does this come from? I've never seen it in any book and I'm fairly well read. Then the flipside are the barren wasteland replies where you have to really scavenge for a kernel of something to work with out of a sliver of 2 paragraphs. \n\nHonestly, I rarely have these problems anyway.

To me, sometimes that means a long post rich with detail, and sometimes- a little more rarely -that means two or three sentences.

            "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ability to be flexible and know when a scene needs six paragraphs and when it needs one to keep the dialogue fair and keep the scene moving is incredibly important. I just want someone who can also match me when the scene calls for the longer posts so I don't feel like I'm carrying all the weight of scene-setting and I've found them by advertising as \"advanced lit/novella\" more than just not mentioning it at all. \n\nI personally write a word count in my post cause I get a lot of responses from people who go \"well, my grammar doesn't suck but I only respond with ' -insert response dialogue and one action here-' so that means I'm literate because I run my stuff through spellcheck\" which I don't like. I advertise as advanced lit mostly to try and deter these people. This is also why I ask for writing samples now. \n\nI want someone who can match the effort I put out. My grammar may not be perfect but I do try, same with my spelling, but it's a lot about the effort I receive and give. If I'm responding with 5-7 paragraphs a character and, especially early in the game where character establishment, backstory, and motivations can be so easily woven into the post... I don't want a paragraph unless we are doing a quick back and forth scene that needs to be kept snappy. Three perfectly written sentences when I've given you two bits of dialogue and a physical interaction to respond to doesn't make sense to me. \n\nGod knows I don't want to read about what \"her pearlescent blue orbs\" did every damn post, but most humans don't stand perfectly still in any situation. Give your character some life, have them fidget, have them look around and notice something or get distracted, have their face DO SOMETHING. If my characters face contorts into a sneer and he takes a step away and your character has literally no reaction to this behavior that most people, if it happened in real life, would at least react to such a physical response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, with the apparent stigma it has, I feel like I may be missing out on a lot of good people so I'm probably gonna make some edits to my search thread but now I gotta figure out a way to word it correctly.",

            "body": "I'm going to be honest, this part in your ad\n\n&gt; I'm a semi-lit roleplayer, often posting +1500 words a post between two characters.\n\nWould make me back out. 1500 words is roughly three pages of a novel- and normally no character, unless they're in a literal novel, really needs three pages of text for a rp scene. Especially if characters are having a conversation or taking part in some kind of action together, where they can realistically respond and react in a timely fashion.\n\nIn glancing back through my own writing, the last time I purposely set out to hit 1500 words was for quest exposition in a game server last year, which I broke up into parts for readability- two letters to my character's wife, and a series of vignettes as my guy traveled and adventured. I doubled for NPCs he encountered and the whole thing was meant to read more like a short story.\n\nMy most recent threads, however, usually hover around 250 words, enough for some introspection into a character's thoughts, to add flavor like body language and/or setting detail as it relates to my character, what the heck they're up to, and to provide something my partner can latch onto and build off of. In my normal rp haunts &amp; main, I usually keep links to examples, so interested players can see my writing style and opt in or out.\n\nI'd suggest dropping novella-anything as a descriptor in your ad, and clipping the call for specific word counts. Keep asking for samples and maybe emphasize you're looking for players who follow through with \"yes, and-\" as a way to build the scene with you.",

            "body": "1500 is written between two separate characters as I always double up. So if I make a post with two of my separate characters that aren't interacting with each other it often comes about 600-800 words or 5-7 paragraphs a character. This is definitely not between one character in one scene and I often have a small cast of NPCS in the background that I'm playing to add it on because I like to give my partners a cast of people to interact with as forcing two people together can often times get *incredibly* unnatural so I guess 'characters' is generous. I hope that clears it up because in your example you listed was only one character and I wasn't sure if you thought I meant that as a one character word count thing, and if so thank you for letting me know so I can reword that nonsense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, thank you for the feedback, I'm literally always trying to find ways to get this writing to a level better than just the school level I got.",

I don\u2019t specifically look for people who say they\u2019re advanced lit, because the label has become useless. It doesn\u2019t contain the nuance that is really needed to describe someone\u2019s exact writing style, but then again, that can be said of all labels. When I read ads, the ones that interest me usually put a bit more words into describing what they do as a writer (\u2018I write as much or as little as needed\u2019 is a buzz phrase I\u2019m fond of) catch my eye. \n\nMy posts nowadays usually average between 400-1,000 words, looking at the word count of the last few posts I\u2019ve written for various partners.",
