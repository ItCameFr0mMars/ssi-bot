I'm not offended but I can sense the entitlement is strong with you. I don't think you were expecting people to disagree with you. Looking at my account doesn't really mean anything other than the fact you were snooping to try and find something to gain the high ground with. Looking at your profile doesn't tell me much of anything about you either.\n\nEdit: no, I didn't look at your post history. I'm not that big of a child to look through someone else's shit to try and make their arguments less valid in the abscence of having one. Hope you learn that your opinions can be disagreed with whilst agreeing to disagree with someone else. I'm not particularly interested in watching what is essentially you having a tantrum continue. My shift starts in a bit and I would rather not have to see yet another comment about you basically trying to put me downbeat by calling me names like a playground bully. You've got people who've both agreed and disagreed with you. You're obviously not old enough to post on the internet if you can't handle that people will not always agree with you. Anyways please don't reply, I don't want my brain cells to have to die knowing they've witnessed someone who sounds like they've never actually rped before complaining about every rper ever on a sub where people post about bad rpers. What you perceive as whiny and bitchy is different to everyone else's and then asumming said rper's have no social skills tells me you're the big entitlement. Buh bye.",

            "body": "So just going to add in my two cents here, I do 100% agree with you that communication is extremely important. I do mainly Play by post forum RP, I run a discord server of my own to help with communication which does help.\n\nHowever let me ask you a question if I may? Have you ever RPed before at all and have had any bad experiences with some? \n\nIf not then it\u2019s more of an outsider looking in. Having their own opinions on the sub, if you have a story where an OP hasn\u2019t said they have had any communication with their partner or member of their group show us then. Otherwise it\u2019s just an opinion. Now onto the post itself, I\u2019ve read it more as an attack really rather than a rant or vent, and arguing with a fellow poster who gave their opinion you kind of attacked them. If you do have concerns don\u2019t judge and be waving a gun around really.\n\nNow I\u2019ve had my fair share of bad and horrible RP experiences with others, and I\u2019ll probably end up sharing at some point. And I\u2019ve been RPing since high school I\u2019m 28 now, RP is like a passionate hobby of mine I\u2019m sure as hell don\u2019t consider myself the best writer around but I do have fun with it, we all have something to vent about and let them vent. Anyway yeah that\u2019s my thoughts.",
