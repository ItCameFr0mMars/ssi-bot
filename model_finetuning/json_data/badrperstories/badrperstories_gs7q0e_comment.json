Did you give them a chance to show you that this OC could be handled well?  \nThis doesn't seem like this fits this sub tbh, since any OC can be good if handled well and given the chance. An OC is bad when it acts out and isn't done very well by the person, but nothing indicates this?  \nWhat made it OP? What were the rules of your group that made it OP comparatively? I think we need more context here lmao",
