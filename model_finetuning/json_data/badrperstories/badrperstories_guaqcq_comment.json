Hell, I've even experienced it semi recently in a table top rpg and it got to the point where I had to tell our game master that the situation wasn't fun anymore and it would need to be remedied because I just couldn't play my character with someone else due to all sorts of... mischief and malicious attacks in character.\n\nIt's fine to have left and it's fine to grow out of RP partners and realize, hey, we really don't mesh anymore. That happens! \n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to feel uncomfortable participating in what's supposed to be a fun hobby. You do you. Make yourself comfortable in your space again.\n\nStart writing! You can go with new things, just writing out concepts and/or characters, or... maybe what you need to to reclaim those old characters of yours and make them, well, yours again.

            "body": "As someone who loves heavy themes and horror, that partner you had doesn't sound like they were in it for friendship. I love doing sadistic realistic things to characters but I would never force that onto my partner. I always clearly set boundaries before a roleplay to make sure what is okay and what's not. Strike one, I talk to them about it and see what's wrong. Strike two, either we change the roleplay to fit us both or we move on to other people.\n\nAs bad as it is, I think roleplay attracts a lot of unstable people. I've encountered many and tbh I am probably one myself in a way or two. You have to understand that if someone doesn't respect your boundaries than they aren't worth having around. I had a similar experience with someone who ooc would blow up at me with depressing stuff and get angry when I didn't want to fix their problems. It was a really close relationship and tbh it hurt for a couple months. \n\nStepping away is the best thing to do imo. Keep writing but stick to people you're already comfortable with or just take a break until you're ready to start again. Make another account completely if you feel the need to. That's what I did, it was a fresh start for me. \n\nTLDR: If someone doesn't respect your boundaries if you've made it clear than don't waste your time. Even as a person who love the messed up things, I would always respect boundaries and tone it down and apologize if I crossed a line.",

It felt like absolute hell.\n\nOne day you may introduce a character, and then the next, they're getting choked out by a giant sadistic wolf creature before getting harmed greatly and then turned into one(which...if you are wondering why I'm being so specific, it's because that also happened once...ugh.)\n\nI made it clear what I wanted and I guess she didn't really honor that. Heck, she even killed off one of my characters before asking me(which was one of the boundaries we set).\n\nAs for the break, I've already taken one and have tried to get back into rping with new partners and friends who I think would...better suit my rping direction.\n\nThank you for your input.

I am, however, someone that is passionate about deep characters and background stories(examples being Adventure Time/Avatar/etc.), and invest time in writing characters stories, interactions, etc. \n\n(A quick note on the pet thing: the pet got sick and in two sentences, infected the boy and then the boy died in those two sentences.)\n\nWell, the unfortunate fact was that I did leave. I just couldn't take what she was doing to her characters and mine anymore. I'm not trying to sound like a wuss or a wimp. I'm someone who really likes people, despite being shy, and to feel like your only friend at the time being was hurting you was something that really made it hard for me to move on. I don't make friends easily, because I am quieter, so it just made things difficult to move on. I am, at the moment, still moving on and almost there.\n\nIs it bad to feel awful for how some characters are treated? I feel stupid now for having typed all that.",
