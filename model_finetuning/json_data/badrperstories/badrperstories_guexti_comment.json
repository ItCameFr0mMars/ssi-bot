            "body": "A full paragraph or two isn't really overboard. If you break it down, that's 8 sentences, which is really not a lot. I'm not saying that to devalue your contributions, please don't misunderstand. I'm saying this because if your partners are making you feel like that's too much - they're probably still just very new to RP. You're in the introductory portion of the multi-para demographic of the RP community, and it seems like the partners you're getting are in the newer one/two-line demographic.   \n\n\nTypically this happens as a role player's writing naturally develops, getting more and more detailed as they grow, if they stay looking in the same pools that they started playing in.   \n\n\nRegarding who is in the wrong here, I'd argue that it's about 30/70. A quick scroll through this subreddit will tell you that ghosting is just a bad practice. If you're not interested in continuing a story, the mature thing is to be honest with your partner about that and know that any outbursts on their part will be purely a commentary on their lack of maturity while you did the right thing. However, if this person is the one down-voting all your posts, then they're being petty and immature, and I'd say that 70% of the \"Wrong\" here is from them.   \n\n\nThat said, across reddit, it's not uncommon for other randos to just go along, downvoting other people's posts purely because they feel it gives them a better chance of their own posts being seen. I'm curious how you know the one down-voting your posts is this person.   \n\n\nOverall, I would recommend you find a new place to advertise your stories than whatever subreddit it is you're using. If this is something that happens often, it's likely that the player pool of that particular subreddit is one catered to \"newbie\" players who range in the 1-2 line post zone. It might be better for you to start marketing yourself as multi-para in your ads and stipulate that if you're not matched, you're not interested, because again - 8 sentences is really not that much. It's a hobby. You're allowed to have standards and preferences for what you find fun and what you're muse is asking for. Anyone who complains is doing so because they know they're not at your level *yet* , and they should take that as inspiration to grow their own writing style.",
