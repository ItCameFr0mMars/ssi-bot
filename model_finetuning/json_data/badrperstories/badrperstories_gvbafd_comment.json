If she brings it up expressing guilt I would just tell her that creative burnout is normal when you are dealing with too much stress in life. It's easy to get stuck in a cycle of feeling pressure to RP, which makes it even harder to RP, which adds more pressure, etc. \n\nIt is very hard to accept moments in our lives when we desperately want to do something but just do not have the emotional or mental resources to do it. I would just stop bringing up RP at all, and if she expresses guilt how about it, just tell her you know how much she wants to RP and you're sorry it's so difficult for her right now. But that the door will always be open whenever she's ready, so there's no need to rush. \n\nI would consider trying to make plans with her to do things like watch movies or play games. I went through something similar and I think the most painful thing was not just losing the hobbies I loved, but losing the people I interacted with because of them. It wasn't their fault, it's only natural that you become less close if you aren't doing anything together. So it's a particularly powerful helplessness, a slow isolation that is no one's fault, but you don't have the strength to prevent. \n\nBecause I think that's what the pain is really about, not losing the ability to RP, but losing people you care about, and feeling like you are losing a part of yourself.",
