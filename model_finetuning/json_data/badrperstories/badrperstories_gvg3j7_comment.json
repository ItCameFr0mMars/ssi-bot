If you\u2019ve established her as a soft, goofy character over many posts, it\u2019ll be a weird kind of whiplash if you suddenly make her hardcore again all of a sudden.\n\nThis is why I tend not to make profiles of characters before beginning a Roleplay; no matter what your intentions are, the character eventually sorts itself out much of the time and goes in a completely different direction from conception. Being able to separate yourself from your character is something that tends to come with experience, tbh.\n\n... Though. I will admit if a partner of mine described their character doing fortnite dances for no reason they\u2019d immediately find themselves blocked on all platforms, because I\u2019d assume I was being trolled, lmfao.",
