I'm in a similar boat in that I have a long-term steady partner and we've written a behemoth of a story together (over 400K words!) but now that the pandemic is \"over\" (ha!) she's busier with work and it's slowed down quite a bit. But she's assured me she's still interested and we're still trucking along -- just at a slower pace. Sometimes you just have to take people at their word and not second-guess them. Just enjoy what you've got going on with Sam, and maybe if you want a little side-RP to keep you occupied when they're busy, start something else up. At the very least, you can use this experience as inspiration for finding other partners.",
