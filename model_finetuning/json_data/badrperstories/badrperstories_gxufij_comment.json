            "body": "I had a ship in my main server. There was a professor character who got with my university student professor (I know, cringe, but they were actually really sweet). The reason they had to part was that the professor's writer would go for weeks between posts, and because of the nature of the story - it left me out of a lot of play. I asked to break the characters up until the writer could find more time to play, which was probably really impatient of me to do, so the guy said that if they broke up, he would rather just kill off his character and leave the story.   \n\n\nAt first I didn't want to do that, but eventually it had been months of him not being active, so I took the deal. My character is now happily engaged to someone else who is active, and it's wonderful, but she still mourns that professor and she'll have dreams about them just sitting and talking about their relationship and what they could have done differently. I basically just wrote in closure for her, and it legitimately did help her to move on and myself by proxy. I think it's more the loose end that I was mourning, not knowing the *what-if*s of their potential happily-ever-after.",

I had a plot for a story I got really invested in, and brought up the idea of roleplaying to her\u2014 neither of us had ever done it before, but we were very excited to try. \n\nSure enough, we ended up become long-term partners and wrote together nearly every single day. We had several stories we played but the main story was extremely long, intricate, detailed... the characters were various and fleshed out. I loved this story so much it\u2019s hard to even put it into words. There was a main couple in the story, which of course we each played a character of. My friend and I actually ended up falling in love and dating, partially because we became so invested in our characters\u2019 relationship, and began to see each other as a romantic partner rather than just a writing partner. This relationship lasted about a year, and we ended up breaking up, but still we continued being roleplay partners writing nearly everyday for FIVE years. \n\nSo of course when our friendship came to an end (because it turns out she became a horrible person, unfortunately), I was crushed. Absolutely devastated. And I\u2019m still affected by it to this day. I can\u2019t stand who she is as a person anymore and I\u2019m happy not to have her in my life, but that story meant so much to me... I miss it literally every day. I love it so much I would love to write it all out and turn it into a novel some day, but it feels so wrong to do it without her. I spent my entire adolescence building this world and these characters with her, and the loss of that hits me way harder than the loss of her love or friendship ever did.",
