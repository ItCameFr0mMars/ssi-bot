Like, no other personality traits of note, no motivation, no goals for their characters, and nothing resembling growth. They're a sub, that's it. \n\nAnd maybe if the whole thing was only an ERP, I could sort of understand it, but even in regular, non-sexual, totally safe-for-work roleplay, they go all uwu. It's scary...\n\nI like playing the more masculine, jagged-around-the-edges characters that don't necessarily express feelings well. That's apparently a dom now (as opposed to a stilted human being in need of serious emotional growth) ...\n\nDoubly sad: I like actual BDSM so watching this happen in RP is outright maddening.",

In a way I can *understand* that, but also it's boring as hell and I won't write with someone who does that. \n\nI have a few 'types' I enjoy writing, and it's funny since two of my types are polar opposites: *big* muscled very top types (usually good natured), and then smol bottoms. With my bottoms though I don't like the 'uwu I'm baby and nothing else' types of characters we've all seen, where they have no skills, no independence, no stated goals, no *power.* They are just 'uwu baby'. Exhausting. Give your OCs goals, means, agency, opinions, or at least a healthy mix of *stuff*. Make them a character, not a subby prop to project onto. Make sure they act and aren't just always (or usually) acted *upon.*\n\nI mostly write 'bottoms' with my RP partner because she mostly prefers writing tops while currently I lean more towards writing bottoms and it's worked out that way well. Out of our pairs the breakdown is that she writes tops in more than half our pairings, I write tops in just a few (her preference more than mine), and for nearly half our pairings they are verse/switches to varying degrees one way or the other.\n\nIn the past I've had huge periods of time where I only wrote tops and ran into nothing but 'uwu bottoms' over and over again and I was so over it. I even had a few that *seemed* to not be uwu bottoms at the start then morph into that once we started writing. It's just so lazy, and I always wanted to shake them and remind them harshly that I was **not** the character I was writing, they weren't the character *they* were writing, and to bring back the 'edge' their character had that made my character notice them in the first place.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve been wondering this for years. It\u2019s very frustrating. But, I think it stems from the couple dynamic &amp; nsfw preferences. \n\nA lot of girls play MxM, a lot of girls prefer freeform roleplay in general. For nsfw, I have always kind of written it if my partner wanted to, so I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s not a role I\u2019m \u2018in\u2019 to I guess. But lately I\u2019ve tried to do more of those kind of RPs for my sake, and I can\u2019t get into it unless I play the same role I do in real life. So that could be part of it. \n\nBut what annoys me more is the dynamic. I have found a lot of people who want me to basically write a one sided Roleplay where my character is so in love with theirs and would do anything for them. The whole story is sort of centered around whatever, but repeatedly their character needs saving from an abusive household, or bullies, or an abusive ex. I think that kind of hurt/comfort can be therapeutic for people, to have someone write about comforting \u2018you\u2019, or your character that you relate to. \n\nI like hurt/comfort or angsty RPs to be a give and take. I love seeing my characters go through something and get a couple words of support at the end. It\u2019s also just a great way to bond characters, if not a little over indulgent and lazy. \n\nI have lots of switches, if not all switches, that these people hate, so they never really get played the way I want them to. They get pushed towards top roles all the time. Switches are unicorns and I love them.",
