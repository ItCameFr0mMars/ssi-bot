I always looked at it as a video game: people would bring in a character and they'd follow through a story learning about the world and eventually defeating some big boss or something. Idk. Right now, I'm at a point where I'm just considering not rping at all. I spent so much time developing this world, developing the characters in them, the maps, the stories, the folklore, food, and so much  stuff that it just feels pointless now. To me, it feels like I just wasted two years of my life and countless hours on something that doesn't work.\n\nAs much as I'd love to go into Novel writing and what not(as I think some have suggested), I just don't feel comfortable putting it out there because I don't think I could ever write something that would be of interest to someone. The RP experience is beautiful, because it allows me to sort of bring the new character (whoever I'm rping with's) character in, and have them adapt and change due to the environment they're in. \n\nI just don't know what to do with it now.",

            "body": "I don\u2019t know if this is of any help to you (especially since I\u2019m late to the party and it\u2019s supposed to be a vent, not asking for advice), but I\u2019ve got some time on my hands, so here\u2019s why I personally (!) don\u2019t like playing in pre-made worlds. Other comments already touch on this, but perhaps my perspective can be useful to you :)\n\n**Problem: Initial flood of information**\n\nWhen I start playing with a new partner, I need to evaluate whether we click or not. Doing some prep work and jumping into a world-building scene works great for that\u2014you can just talk about some preliminaries and then hop right in. If (and this is an exaggerated example) before hopping in I need to read the 700-year political history of my partner\u2019s pre-made world, an essay on what sort of technology does and doesn\u2019t exist and a summary of the political situation just before the first scene starts, that\u2019s a lot of work to put into something that might not even be my thing. I can only evaluate that through actually playing a scene, and the more work I have to put in before that scene can even start, the less enthusiastic I am.\n\n**Potential fix: Beginner-friendly, piece-by-piece introductions**\n\nAs overused as the amnesia trope is, I have to admit it works great for introducing a new player to an existing world. Variations with the same effect would be (depending on the setting and not exactly viable for post-apocalyptic scenarios, I admit) cryogenic freezing, reincarnation, time travel\u2014basically anything that throws the character into an unknown world. Both the player and their character share their lack of knowledge. Not being a native to your world, I don\u2019t have to know a whole array of different things just so I can **start** playing. In a post-apocalyptic setting, maybe the newly introduced player\u2019s character grew up in isolation\u2014as part of a cult in a bunker telling them that there\u2019s nothing outside and they\u2019re the last civilisation. There\u2019s lots of things you can do to reduce the imbalance between character knowledge and player knowledge.\n\n**Problem: Minimal participation**\n\nNot everyone wants to play with a DM and have little to no agency. I\u2019m not accusing you of being such a DM\u2014I\u2019m just sharing my experiences with pre-made worlds. Even in someone else\u2019s world, I prefer **some** degree of agency. If all the \u201cstory slots\u201d are already filled (i.e. you\u2019ve already come up with answers for all the questions one could ask your world), then there\u2019s no room for me to decide anything\u2014except for my character\u2019s reaction to events you set up.\n\n**Potential fix: Leave room for participation**\n\nYour world might need some blank spaces to be filled by your RP partner. Perhaps there\u2019s a settlement whose systems and NPCs you haven\u2019t fixed in place yet. After introducing your partner\u2019s character into the world, perhaps they venture there and your partner gets to hold the reins for some time. Is there any space for sub-plots that might only loosely tie in to your overall story?\n\n**Problem: Pre-made story**\n\nPre-made worlds and pre-made stories aren\u2019t the same thing. In my experience, RPers who insist on using their pre-made worlds can also be somewhat inflexible when it comes to changing the story they envision. A character I introduce might create a story problem that my partner doesn\u2019t want to fix, so the character has to go. My character is supposed to give up when presented with a seemingly insurmountable task, but I have an idea for an easier way around the problem\u2014my partner doesn\u2019t like that because the obstacle was never meant to be overcome; it was supposed to be a source of frustration leading to an entirely different path. Pre-made worlds (in my experience!!!) often come with this sort of mindset, and that makes me feel like I\u2019m an unpaid actor in someone else\u2019s novel.\n\n**Potential fix: be flexible!**\n\nI tend to be a pantser as opposed to a plotter, or if I plot, I have an endpoint in mind and am flexible on how to get there. I enjoy obstacles created by my partner, even if I\u2019m strictly speaking the DM. \u201cWell, that went completely different than expected. \u2026 Cool!\u201d That\u2019s basically my attitude, and I get that it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s. Still: if you\u2019re a plotter, plot different paths. Identify the crossroads in the story you envision, and be truly prepared for your partner to choose the path you weren\u2019t planning on initially. Leave some space for your partner\u2019s decisions to matter. \n\n----------------\n\nAgain: I\u2019m not accusing you of doing all these things. These are just the things I look out for whenever I read an ad for a pre-made world\u2014the things that, in my experience, often happen when I try jumping into a pre-made world. If you\u2019re already aware and actively trying to curb these issues, you should probably let prospective partners know. Show them you\u2019re aware in your ad. Tell them how much participation you encourage, require or allow. \n\nWhenever you leave a blank in an ad, people will fill it with their experiences. I do the same with my priorities, I admit. No mention of preferred gender pairings for romance and NSFW content? Probably a straight dude who won\u2019t even play a woman for a change. Pass. No mention of preferred post length? Probably either one sentence or three A4 pages. Pass. No mention of time zones? Probably US-American with a normal sleep and work schedule who won\u2019t be compatible with my sad European existence. Pass.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a couple of people on several platforms advising against long ads with lots of detail. And perhaps it\u2019s true that people are lazy and don\u2019t read long ads. Then again: are people who skip long ads the kinds of people I want to play with? If I don\u2019t mention something specific that I want (not slightly prefer, not am okay with, **want**), people who can\u2019t provide that will message me and I\u2019ll be disappointed\u2014and people looking for that specific thing might not see anything special in my ad. If I **do** mention it, sure, lots of incompatible people won\u2019t respond. So what? People who are compatible might think: \u201cHuh, that person mentioned Trait X! I like Trait X! Cool!\u201d\n\nI hope this helps or, if I\u2019m terribly wrong, at least amuses you. :)",
