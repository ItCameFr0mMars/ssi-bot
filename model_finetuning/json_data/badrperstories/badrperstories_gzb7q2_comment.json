There are thousands of servers out there with similar enough premises that are nowhere near as strict for them to go be butterflies at, but if they want something that's well run, they need to be able to keep up. Especially when you're making your expectations clear from the start.   \n\n\nI will never understand people who just casually ignore the lore and rules of a server and apply and then act shocked when they're called out. You're giving them multiple warnings, you're transparent about what will be asked of them from the get-go. These people are just entitled brats who expect you to compromise your server's integrity for them, and ... nah.",

If only the previous (&amp; current) partner (s) i\u2019ve had can do that, lol. But it\u2019s just all i ask that i need something to work with. \n\nAnd i understand, if you want then i can help you or we can help each other out. I dont mind.
