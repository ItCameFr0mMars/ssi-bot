            "body": "I'm not sure how to really phrase this in a way that won't come off as inflammatory, so apologies in advance, but here we go.\n\nCondoms aren't sexy. Spending fifteen minutes delicately lubing someone's asshole so that penetration doesn't hurt isn't sexy. Stopping every fifteen minutes to make sure your partner is okay and verbally ask for their consent? Not sexy. Going to the bathroom to piss after sex so that you don't get a UTI? Talk about a mood killer. \n\nPerhaps, to some people, these things are sexy. I will acknowledge that. And in real life, obviously, all of the above are important to a sexual relationship between two humans. But in real life, we also have to go to the DMV, and go to the bathroom every few hours, and clean the dishes after making dinner, and I don't see any of these things ever covered in roleplay. \n\nAs writers, we take certain shorthands and shortcuts and tend to write a slightly idealized version of the worlds in which we play. And it's not only ERP where this stuff happens; people interested in writing medieval fantasy tend not to cover the fact that sewers didn't usually exist like they do in the modern world, and people tossed their chamber pots out into the street, and that body lice was extremely common, and that dental hygiene was pretty poor, so when your tooth hurt, you went to the barber (yes, the barber), and they would just rip it right out of your head without anesthesia. \n\nLike, all of those things are real facts of living in a medieval setting. But they get left out of most roleplay, and writing in general. Because writers typically enjoy writing about fun things, and kind of skip over the mundane realism, be it in sex or in science fiction or in slice of life or in fantasy (unless, of course, you're GRRM, who loves to detail his characters' terrible shits).\n\nMy advice? Instead of bemoaning the fact that the ERP community and anyone who writes sex as a whole is like this, I'd point you to [F-list.net](https://F-list.net), where you can make your own custom list with your own custom kinks on it. Feel free to put condoms and realism and using lube and all of that stuff on your mandatory/faves list, and link it to potential partners so you're on the same page. \n\nOh, and re: traps and futas. Hi, I'm a trans guy, and I'm literally the first person to completely fetishize my own transmale characters. A lot of trans\\* writers I play with take a similar approach to that subject matter because it's kind of fun to subvert the tropes, so your mileage may vary on that one.",
