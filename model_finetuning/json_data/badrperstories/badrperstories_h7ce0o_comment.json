            "body": "Ghosting always reminds me of the endless emails that have spent literal months sitting in my inbox that I've never responded to. Usually, it's because I just don't have the energy to write back. Or I just can't think of anything to write. Then time passes, and before I know it, *too much* time has passed, which makes it hella awkward to stir the issues all back up all over again. So that becomes a feedback loop: you don't respond because you took too long, which causes you to take longer to respond, which makes it worse. \n\nOn the other hand, though, people don't like being left hanging, because then they just don't know what's up. That's 100% understandable, too. It's a tough line to walk, but when you know that you've got someone waiting, sometimes it's best to take a deep breath and just bite the bullet. It sucks letting people down and can leave you feeling super guilty. It probably feels kind of like having to break up with a person in fact, which, in a way, it kind of is. That can be rough, but sometimes you just have to rip the Band-Aid off. Once it's over with, you may find yourself feeling relieved more often than not.",

            "body": "I'm guilty of this as well. Sometimes it's not really particular to that person -- I'll just discover that the story doesn't compel me that much, or the characters aren't quite vibing. Often, it seems that those partners and I will just do a mutual ghosting. The roleplay fizzles out and neither one of us makes a move to reach out and try to resurrect it, or even check in with each other, and in my mind, that means it was like one of those awkward first dates where you both just kinda never reach out again, because what is there to say, really?\n\nHowever, if a partner *does* reach out, I will strive to be honest (but diplomatic) and explain that  I'm just not feeling it, or the story didn't quite grab me, or whatever it is that's going on that made it fizzle. If they ask, I will try to answer. It might not be the blunt, honest truth (because I can't bring myself to tell someone that their writing is mediocre or bores me), but it will at least be *an* answer. I figure I owe them that much at least.\n\nOh, and FWIW, I don't really consider it true \"ghosting\" unless a storyline has been started. When it's just exchanging a few messages with a potential partner that then peters out, to me that's like making small talk at a party. You chat a bit and see if there's a vibe, and if not, you move along. I did get one potential partner get super angry at me for not responding to our chat for a couple of days, but to me, we hadn't even *started* anything. We were still feeling each other out and the vibe wasn't quite there, but she ended up sending me a bunch of messages about how mean and judgmental I was (because I asked her some questions about her character?) then she immediately blocked me so I couldn't even respond. Thankfully, that's the only time that's happened (so far).",

            "body": "I don't think the general consensus is that ghosters are jerks so much as immature, which fear can fall into, respectfully. I don't think \"immature\" inherently is an insult, either. Children are immature, because they're still growing. Similarly, adults are constantly growing and learning new ways to process things, so not every adult will be as mature as another, which **is okay!**  \n\n\n The reasons you listed, while valid, would still fall under an umbrella of immaturity. You don't know how to effectively communicate that you want to leave, or you don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with the potentially negative response. These aren't jabs at you or your stage in personal development. They're just statements.   \n\n\n  It tends to be that when people feel they need to defend their actions, as you've just done, it's because they know something they've done is the wrong thing to do. You've also just expressed that statement. I'm not here to beat you over the head with \"you did a bad thing and you're a bad person for it.\" If anything, I'm trying to say that in expressing that you know you've done this and you know it's wrong, you are making progress toward that eventual maturity in this aspect - which is a very good thing.   \n\n\nFurther, I think that people who get ghosted, rather than immediately hopping into here and venting about it - should take the time to really think about *why* it happened or has continued to happen. Once or twice over the years is probably someone else's issue; but most of the posts I see on this subreddit are about how it *keeps* happening to them, which implies that *they* are doing something to drive other writers away. It's a two way street. There's an inherent immaturity to them too that they need to also face down.   \n\n\ntl;dr - be patient with yourself, but also be patient to others - we all suck a little now and then.",
