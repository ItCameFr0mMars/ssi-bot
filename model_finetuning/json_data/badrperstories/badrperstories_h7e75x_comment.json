            "body": "INFO: When you join these servers and feel like your character is generally ignored - have you tried approaching the staff to ask for scenes or generally see if you can stir up some interest?   \n\n\nI run one lore-heavy literate server and I help mod a second one. In both, we've found that most players hate it when we're telling them \"hey, join this scene, it'd be great for your character\" so it's taught the staff and I to hang back and let players come to us. Unfortunately, with the shy players, they end up leaving because they feel unwanted despite that very much not being the case. It's just that we have no way of knowing who will respond well to us setting up scenes for them and who won't. I'm wondering if that's the same thing for you.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, I know that clique-play does run very rampant in the RP community. People find those 3-5 players they vibe with and they'll only write with them, effectively boxing out newer players which is super unfortunate because no one ever grows as a writer when doing that.   \n\n\nIn general, next time you join a new server, before you apply, I would recommend interviewing the staff a little. Think of the application process like getting a job. You want them to like your character, but they also want you to like their server. Don't be afraid to privately message one of them and ask how they help new players get involved in the story. If they don't want to answer, or they get snippy, or they tell you that they don't help and it's up to the players - then leave. In every story I've joined (at least, on Discord), the general rule is that the staff is obligated to do scenes with any player that wants one provided they have the time and energy for it, if they don't - they should consider getting more staff to handle all the players and additional obligations.",

I've been on the staff side before so while I can be shy, I do try to convey my interest but perhaps I'll work on trying to be clearer too.\n\nI do agree some people can get touchy about plots and being offered them so I'll keep that in mind going forward. \n\nAlso thanks for the reminder of that it's not just me being interviewed so to speak? It's a good reminder that it's a two way street as I was starting to get a bit disheartened over not finding good fits despite my efforts.",
