Are you sure you were banned for asking questions and not something else you may have done or said?\n\nI won't lie, it sounds like you hold animosity against the staff and if you talk to them or others with that kind of attitude... it's pretty disrespectful towards people that run a site you apparently like since you're still there.\n\nAlso, unless you've heard from the other people, maybe you shouldn't assume why they split; it sounds like you're a bit sensitive about it. You also shouldn't call what others write \"filler,\" because filler to you may be the sort of things they want to write.\n\nAs for that event... it sounds like they're preserving a freedom for the writers by providing an event without strongarming the rest of their world into participating or being impacted by.\n\nIt sounds like the site staff holds freedom within boundaries as paramount even when it is a result of their actions; a user could choose to ignore the event in its entirety without repercussions if they so wished.",
