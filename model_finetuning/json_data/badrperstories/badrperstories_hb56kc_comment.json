            "body": "To be fair on Hera not having children, I'm pretty sure (could definitely be wrong I vaguely remember this in one of the Percy Jackson books but it could be a major fever dream) that some of the goddesses created children much like how Athena was made, creating a being as a little gift for the emotional connections they make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf her backstory was done correctly, Hera could have spent some time on earth after a devastating fight with Zeus after one of his affairs and had an emotional affair with someone, or given a serious emotional pick up by a human she met while down on the mortal plane, and gifted them a child despite there being no physical cheating. Would have kept Heras dignity intact, especially if she gave that child she created to a couple who hadn't been able to conceive since she is the goddess of marriage and family, creating a demi god without going to rather randy Zeus way of doing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea about this character, but there is almost always ways of getting the child of a god you want as long as you understand enough about the god or goddess for how to play it. She sounds a lot like a very young and naive RPer who hasn't quite realized how cringy some of the mary and Gary sues could be. If she was a minor, depending on how MUCH of a minor, then there is still room to grow but it is likely she should have been playing with other minors if she wanted anyone to feel comfortable with doing any ERP with her and I hope she has the chance to grow and mature and improve.  \n\n\nEdit: I do agree she should have gotten the boot if she was making the group uncomfortable and I hope things didn't blow up for you and you guys got to go back to having fun! &lt;3",
