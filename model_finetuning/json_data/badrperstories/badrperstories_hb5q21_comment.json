            "body": "I'm not judging here. It sounds like you and Fred's female persona became great friends and you felt betrayed (and maybe even heartbroken) to discover the long-term lie. I suspect other people who knew Kay and then Fred didn't have the same kind of connection and were thus less impacted. This is merely a guess based on what you described.\n\nAnd it makes me think that a lot of us 'play' characters on the internet. Very rarely do I speak my truth, whatever that looks like, to strangers online. It can sometimes be very disconcerting to learn that someone wasn't who you thought they were. But, sometimes it's a protection mechanism, especially for those of the female persuasion to keep away unwanted attention or to keep the strangers online at a distance from their personal lives. \n\nAnd while it can suck, I guess I don't see it as world-ending. I've had friends before that turned out to be someone very different from what I assumed, and honestly, the friendship was worth rearranging how I thought of them.\n\nThat said, you did the right thing following your gut and I hope you meet other people who are more honest and forthright in the future.\n\nJust my $.02...",

            "body": "I would definitely say the Fred\u2019s female persona and I got very close. I just felt very taken advantage of, especially because I was much younger than most of the members at the time. I was 18 and most of them were 25+. I wasn\u2019t a baby, but I certainly wasn\u2019t a grown adult either. Maybe because they were older they were just able to shrug it off. However, I\u2019m 25 now and I feel like if someone did that to me now I would possibly equally be as pissed as I was back then. But we\u2019ll never really know. It still does make me angry to this day tho. \n\nI totally get the whole idea where we are different people online than we are in person. I can admit that I\u2019m different online than I am in person. I just couldn\u2019t rationalize what he did as acceptable behavior. Especially since he was a grown man and I was still barely an adult and he knew that. I\u2019m not trying to say he like preyed on me or anything. It just didn\u2019t feel right.",
