I felt no red flags because their writing was great but I realized I didn't know the ages or general age pool of players. Most where older, but I discovered the person who wanted to ship was only 15.

Then a small group of folks wanted to RP more adult themes because the original site was too PG-oriented. They went off and made a new site which allowed PG-13 - R rated type of themes. Then a smaller group from that site ended up having some OOC drama and beef with the site created, so they branched off and created *their* own site. But then the people in the second site swore the people in the new site did it just to spite them and steal RPers from their site. Then there was a back and forth kind of rivalry between all three sites and just wow, man... \n\nEveryone was in their early 20s by the way... so apparently this kind of behavior tends to linger in larger RP crowds....",
