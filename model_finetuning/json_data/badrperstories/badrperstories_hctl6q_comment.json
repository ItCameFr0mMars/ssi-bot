The plot was that he was some hotshot who she had to marry to make her parents happy for whatever reason so I thought I'd make him a narcissistic jerk so that we could have fun bantering. But instead she had her character walk out on him and told me ooc that she didn't like him and she wanted him to be likeable and romantic. Why then didn't we just do guy-meets-girl romance? Is the arranged marriage not even a plot device? She was fine to have her preference but I told her that I was gonna make him a jerk and she was game until he was an actual jerk and not just a bad boy with a heart of gold, lol.",
