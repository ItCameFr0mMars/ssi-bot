It can often feel like the other person is just expecting you to do the bulk of the worldbuilding and storydriving, and it can be both tiring and disheartening. I've had partners tell me it's because I'm just \"naturally good at it\" and they just \"need a bit of guidance\" but that usually means I have to always do the heavy lifting of starting to plot, having initial ideas, urging them to *also* list some ideas, to get them to not just grab onto the first thing I suggest while listing, or to get them to not try and choose ALL the options I list. Frustrating. Then often if they *do* suggest something, if I am not eager for the idea right away and take their single quickly thought up idea fully on board, they will get upset by that.\n\nThat's for the people who will even try and plot at all with guidance, of course.\n\nAs for the males thing, I can't relate to that, really. I only RP male characters, and only with male characters (for romance plots). I've never been interested in going into the het scene, but I have heard it's a harrowing place.

Therefore, they prefer playing female roles, and often get angry when you have a male character that does not fit their preference (shy, not dominant, and so on).\n\n\\-a lot of roleplayers are female (in some communities almost all), and some people prefer to play characters of their own gender, either because they think that they cannot accurately portray male characters or because they just like to have characters they can fully identify with.\n\n\\-many people do not want to think so much while roleplaying. Often, these people only think 'what if I was the female (or male) character everybody loves in this series, lets start a roleplay with a similiar plot'. They are not truly interested in creating a story which is fun for both people or has interesting characters. They want their very own Twilight/Harem Anime/romance novel fantasy, and for this, you just need the same stereotypes over and over again and enough declarations of love (or smut) to keep it interesting.",

Even though other people enjoyed the character, I just feel like I was very good with writing him. Recently I actually had muse for more male characters. I feel like it really depends on the person. However I think if people are totally bypassing the part of the plot you want to write then I just think they are being rude. I typically won\u2019t try to alter an ad I\u2019m looking into unless the person is totally carefree about it. Which in this case you are very specific. \n\nI guess all in all, I never wanted someone to look at a character I had and think \u201cWow. This is a horribly written character.\u201d \n\nWhen it comes to the plot thing, I find that most people are uncertain when it comes to moving plots along. I usually just have to nudge people and boost their confidence to make sure things move along.

            "body": "I refuse to write with anyone who \"only\" plays females - or only plays one thing at all really; lack of diversity in terms of gender, age, sexuality, ethnicity, etc. tells me they're likely to be playing wish fulfilment characters and therefore are probably going to conflate IC and OOC. Plus, I've never had a good experience with specifically female-only writers. All the ones I've written with have been ridiculously possessive, tried to drive a wedge between me and other rp partners, or even demanded I break up with real life romantic partners to spend more time rping with them. My early rp life was super toxic and I almost never got the opportunity to play anything other than male e-dick characters and actually have them get plots - when I found my current board, it was like being set free from rp jail. Now I'd never go back to one-sidedly fulfilling someone else's fantasies; life's too short for that shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the lack of initiative in plot, I try to address it with the player head on. There's nothing fun about feeling like you're dragging a body. Sometimes it's inexperience, and with a little guidance and encouragement, the other player will work up to being able to share the load of carrying a story. But then sometimes it's sheer laziness and the entitled assumption that if you're going to do all the work, why should they bother. I don't necessarily think this is a strong character thing either - there are plenty of options on how to add interest to a scene, from introducing an NPC to having some kind of external event happen, none of which require the \"weaker\" character to act in an assertive way that goes against their personality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, based on a lot of these responses, it seems like the majority of players here come from a different culture to board culture where, if someone is suspect or selfish, there are so many other players around that they struggle to get uptake from the rest of the memberbase and either have to adjust their behaviour or find somewhere else to play. I haven't had half of these issues since I left 1x1s behind.",
