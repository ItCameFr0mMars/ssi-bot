            "body": "I agree with you there, traumatic backstories do not make a strong character. Some rp plots may call for it and can be interesting for character development, but there has to be a line. Some of the most interesting characters I've encountered had the most run of the mill sort of background. I may be a bit brutally honest, but if every single one of the characters someone has comes from some sort of tragedy, then I would assume they can't move a normal plot forward without making it about their character. Definitely don't try and have your own character come from some sort of sad story either, then it becomes a competition. Certainly may not be their reason, but that is my experience. Sometimes it is nice to just rp with characters who haven't been through hell and back.",

RP is working together to make a plot that's interesting for both people, and sometimes it's highly realistic and a lot of times it's not.\n\nI guess this isn't a direct response to your specific post, but to a lot of posts I see on this sub where people gatekeep this very cheap and fulfilling hobby. \"Their characters are so derivative!\" and \"OMG all their characters are like Disney princesses!\"\n\nSo they just aren't the right partner for you, but it doesn't always mean they're not fit to roleplay with someone else. Some people find a niche and like to stick to it, because maybe there are other interesting characters out there, but they find this type the most interesting to write. It's fine to have a type and stick to it. It's fine to explore. It's fine to like sad and contrived Soap Dramas and it's fine to like detailed and nuanced characters a lot more.\n\nYou don't have to write with someone you don't jive with, but it hurts my heart to see posts bashing people's preferences rather than actual bad behavior.",

It's much better to point to a horrible event (or series of events) that happened to them in the past to explain why, rather than just saying, \"They have insecurities.\" As for specifically family dynamics, this can be a multitude of reasons. Sometimes it's self projection that they cant help, other times it's because the idea of not having that sort of protection a good family offers can explain a lot of things about a character in one event, and the last example I could give is possibly because we've all heard of the backstory so much- and when you dont wanna put much effort into explaining why a character is sad it's easy to just say, \"Bad family.\"",

            "body": "I tend to give my characters backstories littered with hardship. I cut my RP teeth among various Fallout settings and don't particularly seek out run-of-the-mill stuff. Now I only RP in historical settings (wild west, early to mid 20th century) I'm also inspired by a lot by what I read which is thrillers and horrors. These tend to contain bruised characters with traumatic backstories.\n\nThat being said, all the trauma I give them influences their worldview and how they act. I always create a character with the intention of growth and development. Even my character with a fantastic family had something brutal happen in their childhood which eventually set them on the path of becoming a homicide detective. Sure, they're normal. But they also have a fascination with the more darker parts of the human mind. I have a teenager who's mother was a serial killer, and yes, this very much influences her mindset and how she copes with those hazy days of her childhood. I'd say out of the 4 characters I currently play, 3 have a non abusive family unit, but things are still not perfect. One was raised in a huge 'career criminal' redneck clan so she never had much of a chance to walk the straight edge, but they're a loyal unit.\n\nBasically, I do this because I find it interesting and that's what I'm comfortable playing. If people were to look at my character profiles and think it was all a bit too much, that's fine. I'd probably look at a character with no notable hardship in their past (if they're a grown adult) and think it was too little. I'm not here to contain myself, I'm here to experiment and play strange or messed up people. If they're neither of those things, they'd still have certain experiences that made them who they are.\n\nPeople who tend to stay in a certain box like the examples in OP may be wanting to write a certain character and experiment but perhaps they just aren't getting there. Perhaps it's a coping mechanism for them. There's always a reason, but If their reason is 'it makes them more interesting' without putting in any effort to make those experiences influence the character I'd put it down to inexperience. They have to be aware that a tragic backstory by itself won't garner sympathy. I don't read an RP characters tragic history and feel any sympathy. I don't know them, why should I feel for them? They're a fictional character, not a real life victim. Backstory lays the groundwork, the real legwork comes when you actually play the character.",

            "body": "These days, I have a self-imposed ban on dead-parent backstories on any new characters I create. Mostly because it's actually *more* interesting to have parents that the characters can cross paths with again for closure or more drama or what have you...! \n\nI think it's a bit tricky to write a character that doesn't have something going on in their past, though, because then you're left wondering where the conflict is. I agree that you don't have to give your character a broken family all the time. I have a character right now that I've developed who has loving parents, but she had to leave them to escape an oppressive town (in fact, her parents helped her escape). Now her goal is to someday go back and save them. But it's the oppressive town, not her parents, that's the source of her trauma, so she still has trauma to affect her characterization and personality. There's always something that sparks conflict, whether it's in your characters past or something they're about to encounter in your current RP as it develops. \n\nI knew an RPer who had two characters, they were brothers. One brother had a very good life. He was smart, strong, good looking, etc. He was successful in just about everything he did. \n\nThe other brother, who had been separated from his family, ended up suffering a lot of trauma, had a lot of struggles in his life, a lot of inner demons to fight. \n\nBetween these two characters, I was always way more invested in the brother who had endured the trauma. Because whenever he started to embark on a journey to achieve a goal, I found myself wondering \"Will he make it?\"  His brother, on the other hand, I was never invested in. Because if that character embarked on a journey to achieve a goal, I found myself thinking \"Of course he'll make it.\" So it's the conflicts and hurdles and how your characters overcome them that make for an interesting story.",
