We were coming up with reasons our characters could be working together.  I suggested him being hired as a double agent to infiltrate a terrorist cell.\n\n\"No, my character wouldn't do that.\"\n\nI kept coming up with ideas, all related to dangerous situations, and got repeatedly told he wouldn't do any of it.  *He wouldn't even carry a gun, under any circumstances.*\n\nFinally I realized what was going on and asked him if he just wanted a romance plot with no action, and he confirmed that's what he wanted.  If he could just say \"**I** don't like playing out action scenes\" instead of making up the excuse that his **character** wouldn't do it, he could have saved us both a lot of wasted time.\n\nOn another note, what's the deal with people who want to play soldiers, mercenaries, bandits, and assassins, but they don't want any action, ever?  They just want their character's backstory to be \"badass\" without actually doing any of those things...",
