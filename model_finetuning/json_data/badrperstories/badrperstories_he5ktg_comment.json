            "body": "I am trying something about the chocolate milk, haha. \n\nThis entire story is based on one of my latest roleplay experiences.(yes that line about the legs? It was copied straight out of her post). My partner only wanted to write the sub role. I reluctantly agreed and wanted to give the the benefit of the doubt. What followed was her post. It gave me little to work with but I figured it's just a starter and she had to get I to the swing of things. That's fine. \n\nI write my post. Part of it is a reaction to what she wrote but form my character's side of things (not too uncommon I believe. It's my opening post as well and I need to establish where my character comes from and why he is were he is in that part of the plot). After that I do add to the plot and make it move forward. (A good 50% of my post was adding new stuff.) Stopping right before the two characters actually get into a fight because doing so would get into godmoddling era and most people I write with aren't chill with that. \n\nWhat followed was a lot of nitpicking with amazing pillow Princess classics such as: My post didn't take control enough...? Since I write the 'dominant' character. Aka, I should have written all that happens so she could only be reactionary. It was also 'unclear' about what was happening?! \n \nI showed my own post in several discord groups, not all of which are buddies of mine just to get a non-baised reaction. The clear consensus was that I needed to draw a map if I wanted to to be any clearer. She obviously just wanted the plot spoonfed to her. \n\nLastly was she decided it wasn't 'prosy' enough. Never mind her prose only went as deep as telling me how good looking her characters legs are? And what kind of ship they're on. (Basically she told me her character was wearing yoga pants on a flying battle ship. A very deep post Indeed). \n\nOf course all critism was given in a very puffy, elitist and demanding manner. At which point I myself had doubts but I offered to rewrite my post and see what happens. I also told her if she didn't like it just tell me and we can stop the rp. \n\nHer reaction to my new post was kinda hilarious: \n\nHi, I'm sorry but I don't believe I'll be able to write with you. You are a lovely person and I have truly enjoyed talking with you, but there's still 'glaring issues' with your writing and I'm not really in the position to take time to teach you how to fix them. Good luck in all your writing, I'm going to hand over server ownership to you, and leave.\n\n\nI know she tried being 'nice' but framing writing as 'glaring' issues' kinda sounds like it's the worst stuff she's ever read in my oppion. I love she believes she could have taught me how to be a better written would she only have had the time. \n\nShe didn't even give me time to react. Only later did she find out other people had a good laugh at our entire endeavour and how her writing while well written grammar and spelling wise was lacking in creativity or depth. Basically your run of the mill submissive MxM yaoi post. Which is funny cause she acted as if her post was the beesnees. \n\nBest part of it all was her basically telling me: How dare you make fun of my 'ART' ...yes this girl truly believed her writing was art and I should have been grateful to read it. That part out of this whole story is truly art.",

It was one of the most bizare roleplay experiences I've had and the first time someone actually managed to make me believe I was 'unkind' for thinking we didn't vibe. So I stuck up with it and gave it a try until they decided to be a complete dick for not getting to be a pillow princess.   \n\n\nI did think about taking this post down just in case she finds it. I don't feel like she deserves to actually feel bad.   \n\n\nI do thank you for the advice :)",
