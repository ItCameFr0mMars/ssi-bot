(I checked a few other posts of yours and saw you are consistently that way which is very admirable.)\n\nWhen I send someone a PM based on their prompt, I always spend time to write a few eloquent paragraphs of their story even if they didn't ask for it.  I do that so they can see my writing style.  There's a few things that happen after that:\n\n1. They reply, we hit it off and have an amazing RP (very rare)\n2. They reply, we begin the RP and their writing style is not only incompatible with mine but doesn't even match their prompt (rare)\n3. They reply with some sort of \"no\" (common)\n4. They don't reply at all even though I took a solid amount of thought and time in composing my message (very common)\n\nSo yeah, I'm probably wasting my time by doing it, but then again, it all seems to be a crap shoot on DPP, the subreddit where I look for partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of ghosting, it is THE WORST.  I'm not even talking about just roleplay now.  Anytime I have lost interest in a roleplay or don't care to speak to someone, I take five seconds to write, \"Sorry, not feeling it. Good luck.\"  I don't know why that's so hard to do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, yeah, I know that feel. :(",

            "body": "Well, first of all I wouldn't go in looking specifically for NSFW RP and if that's your only goal you might be better off seeking sex chat boards instead which I don't have experience with. That's a whole different beast and is more like seeking porn than seeking roleplay. No shame there, just saying that it's different so the paths to finding it will likely be different. It would likely help if you were flexible and willing to write both the male and female part for het RP, since I'd assume part of the whole problem there is that people wanting to write the male role are more common.\n\nIf you just like some ERP in with your standard RP stories though when it makes sense in the narrative from time to time, I'd say that's fairly standard and something you can discuss with a partner once you find one.\n\nMy following advice is only relevant if you are seeking to do story-driven roleplay. Don't go into a roleplay group that is centered around characters and stories and plots and then be the guy there asking for ERP without wanting the rest. No one likes the guy who can't read the room, most RP groups are not for finding purely ERP even if the writers there will ERP in their plots sometimes:\n\nAs for finding a group, I see group adverts in /r/roleplay fairly often, and I know there are some servers just for finding partners, though I haven't used those. If I was you I'd specifically only check out servers that are 18+ since NSFW elements are something you want. The trick is that once you join, throw yourself right in to the server's OOC chats, have fun plot ideas, show interest in the other RPers characters and their other RP scenes they have going on, engage with people and don't assume they'll come to you. Really dive in. If one server doesn't work after a bit of effort, try another one.\n\nI found my rp partner in a roleplay group several years ago. The group died long ago, but we chat and RP every day years later. I honestly feel that's one of the best ways to find a partner.",

            "body": "This is sooo relatable. It is in no way harsh as I have been put off looking for RP for months because of everything you've said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last RP I was planning out with someone was a Game of Thrones RP. We spent about a whole week planning things out as both of us are in different timezones and were on at different times during the day. We both got on really well, and were totally nerding out about GoT as we came up with our story. She even told me how 'excited' she was to get the story going as she thought it would be a bit different from other RPs she'd been a part of, and was happy to find someone who was okay with a platonic relationship between our characters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the time eventually came to start the RP.  I was super excited and eager as was she, only she wanted me to post first. I did as I'm totally okay with doing so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs usual, the opening post was longer than maybe what I would normally write (even though I do write a decent amount anyway) to set the scene and all that. From that moment onward, the issue started.  I waited and waited for days which turned into weeks, for a response to my post which I'd seen she'd actually read. Nothing came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually I'm not the sort of person to poke someone if I haven't heard from them for a while in RP as I don't want to be seen as '*one of those'*. But as it was the one RP I was really stoked for, I sent her a DM as I'd seen she'd been online since I posted, and asked if she was still interested. To my surprise, she said she was still very interested, and was sorry because she'd totally forgotten about the roleplay (so much for being 'excited' as she kept on telling me). Anyway,  I decided to go along with it and wait some more for her, even if I was a little bit irritated. But hey, I really wanted this RP to go ahead, so I wasn't going to make her feel bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, approximately three months later, do I have a response? Nope. Like I get it when people loose interest in an RP, need a break, are busy irl or feel things aren't going to work out. But to not even respond to the first post is pretty lame. Especially when she kept on going on about how much she was looking forward to it. I'm not sure what even happened, and am reluctant to ask her about it again as it would look pretty sad of me in my opinion ha!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long rant... But yes,  I totally feel your pain, and understand how finding and keeping an interesting RP can be really rough nowadays. I also have taken to writing my own stories instead of RPing with people who either aren't as into it as they make out, make self inserts/mary sues, can't write, don't know the basics of RP, or can't even be bothered to come up with their own characters/plots! I hope your Space Pirate novel is filling the void lol!",
