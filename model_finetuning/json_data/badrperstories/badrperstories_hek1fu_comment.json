I get that it doesn\u2019t have to be incredibly realistic, but I strongly dislike when people take their severally abused or messed up characters and suddenly they are fine with getting up close and personal with others... like... not that I personally know what that\u2019s like, but I definitely know that\u2019s not realistic. Or how that works. I have a friend who does that kind of thing and it drives me up a wall. It\u2019s like why bother with the sad backstory if you aren\u2019t going to follow through with the character development. \n\nAs for how to possibly get this person to leave you alone, that\u2019s tricky. I think the best thing would be just to be honest with them. They are being slightly manipulative if they keep using the stuttering and \u2018...\u2019 Cause they know it\u2019ll help them get their way if they not only pout about it, but re-enforce that it with those things. I think you just need to tell them that it\u2019s just not what you are looking for.",

Make sure to keep logs of conversations with them, and maybe make screenshotted versions of the same.\n\nSecondly, you need to both clearly define and act on your personal boundaries. It doesn't need to come in the form of a critique of their roleplay, and in general the less it can be interpreted as purely an attack the better. You don't want to hand them ammunition unless you're sure you know what they'll do with it.\n\nSetting boundaries and enforcing them consistently is extremely important for all interactions. It helps you personally, but it also helps the community around you weed out bad actors. It's especially important when you're dealing with sexual advances of any kind, which you say you are.\n\nOne of the most simple manipulations I've ever seen at work within a roleplaying community is in fact simply applying gentle, persistent pressure through discontent signaling to implicitly inform people around them that failing to comply with their preferences will result in awkwardness.\n\nNot necessarily explosions, just awkwardness. When successfully implemented, these sorts of ploys result in people in orbit of the manipulator walking on eggshells around them even though the manipulator only has \"making you deal with awkward conversation\" to enforce their preferences.\n\nIn fact, that ellipses thing you mention in your post is a perfect example of this exact sort of discontent signaling! It's not a plain-and-simple statement of discontent, but it does convey that spectrum of emotional implication anyway.",

You can bring up how it doesn't make sense that her character is a primal/feral, despite the obvious neko cliches happening, and automatically warming up to him since an animal in the wild would either kill and run away or just plain run away. You can bring up that the content she's leaning the story toward isn't an actual story so much as a one-off smut scene at best and you're looking for someone to write out an *actual story* with. Put all those things together and end it with \"I don't see you changing your style of writing, which is your decision to make, but it has continued to fail at keeping my interest.

Also I don\u2019t think playing *x, y, or z* gender has any role in this, since you stated yours and your characters genders.  Also don\u2019t take all of this faint of heart, or anything, I\u2019m just trying to be nice. Also Jesus stole your bicycle to help write the Bible 2, so don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nSome of the reasons I view with you in this scenario, is that you allowed him to push over a plot you didn\u2019t particularly like. You should\u2019ve said something at the very beginning, or some ways into the RP. Unintentionally ghosting was kind of \\*ehhh\\*, you may have had a chance, may have not of been able to send a \u201cbusy right now, might not be on for awhile\u201d message or something. Another thing, is at the end, you mention they hint at sexual stuff, and that they\u2019re underage. I\u2019d stop that this instantly because of that behavior, and take proper actions.\n\nA few things I found wrong with your partner is his guilt tripping. I wouldn\u2019t tolerate that and if you\u2019re gone for personal irl issues, then he should respect that and not try to make you continue the RP. Also further, since he further DM\u2019d you and guilt tripped you into continuing. He shouldn\u2019t necessarily be asking for NSFW and extremely kinky stuff when he is underage, back to what I said earlier about this.\n\nMy end all opinion, is that you should kindly say the RP is not for you, and then afterwards not take his guilt tripping crap.\n\n**My One Real Personal Opinion**\n\nHoly fucking shit I wanted to get this in here, but I absolutely want to shank anyone who uses \u201co-oh\u201d or stuttering stuff in your text? Like wtf?  Also if you're minors and this is heading in a bad direction towards sexual roleplay, end it ASAP kind of deal. Even though you won't get cops up your arse, it's always wise to stray away from those kinds of things. Let him do his sexual urges thing on his own.",

Say the actual reasons. \"I don't like your playstyle\", \"it felt too sexual-oriented\", \"you did not roleplay her story\", and so on.\n\nYou have to remember they also want the opportunity to get better, and though you are *not* expected to try roleplaying with them again, you *can* let them know what went wrong, so that they can reflrct on it and improve themselves, both as a roleplayer, and a person.",
