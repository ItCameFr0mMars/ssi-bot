            "body": "In some cases, this is merely a symptom of having an overactive imagination and going overboard as a result. Think of it as small children playing make-believe and coming up with escalating implausible reasons they survive getting shot with a rocket launcher while playing soldier.\n\nBut among older roleplayers, this is a symptom of a self-insert. The rationale ultimately boils down to this: When you are simply giving yourself an avatar into the story rather than playing a different person entirely, it is to your benefit to expand your abilities as wide as possible. Think of how MMOs these days tend to treat the player character. They tend to let you dip into everything at least a little bit, right? And if you're very determined, you can be everything simultaneously with no actual opportunity loss for the doing.\n\nI've seen a third category of this concept in play: The forever character. A forever character is a character that a person has played essentially since they began roleplaying, or who they intend to play persistently in every setting they ever interact with. While a forever character isn't necessarily a self-insert, its flavorings are similar. It is more of an avatar for the writer than a completely realized character, so the writer prefers for them to be an omnicapable ill-defined mashup.",

There were witches and demons and elders and such, all in a coven which hosted a school. Pretty cool setting, and some pretty cool people.\n\nI decide early on I want my which to focus on psychological based magic. So, I end up writing down basically everything that comes to mind. My witch becomes an illusionist, someone who can both create and enter others dreams, a swordfighter and a potion brewer who specializes in love and psychedelic potions, as I thought it'd be cool to have a magic druggie. (Which it totally is).\n\nI wrote out each of her powers and abilities, and I even gave them really reasonable limits, sometimes even throttling potential over-powerdness my character could end up with. I'm happy with how I wrote the powers and abilities, the witches personality, even what I see as a unique trait of magic drugs (maybe it's not but it was and still somewhat is a novel idea to me.)\n\nBut I simply gave her *too* many roles. Even chopping off one aspect of her magical ability would make it more rounded as well as give it a definitive focus other than just 'mind magic'. I still play with this character, but I've rewritten her a bit to make her into what I feel is a much more balanced and less role heavy character. On a side note I've also created a second character, who I only gave one firm role to fill, and it's much more reasonable that way.",
