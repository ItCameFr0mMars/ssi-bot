The RP was actually all done on a social media site, where characters could leave posts, then other characters could comment on those posts. In those comments, conversations would happen between characters in real time, or people would use the comments to RP actions or events happening between any number of characters participating. As characters interacted and developed friendships, etc., groups of characters would have their own things going on. Like a group of characters might plan a party or two characters might agree to go on a date (that's later RP'd in private messages). Other characters might meet up at a bar, etc. \n\nThe general theme was light fantasy, where the characters passed themselves off as human, but most of them had secret powers, or were secretly demons, vampires, or fay disguised as humans. In the case of this RPer's MC and the Love Interest, the MC was a regular human girl with hidden powers of some kind, I think. The Love Interest was a man who practiced hoodoo and had secret supernatural powers of his own because of that. The two of them chatted, went out on dates and to each other's houses, all of which was RP'd through comments left on posts or in private messages.",

Seriously freakin' toxic!\n\nBut sorry for the rant lol! Even though it's an RP story, I relate to it on a uhh... 'spiritual' level ha! Your story is why I try and steer clear from romance RPs as much as possible. Firstly they aren't that interesting, and secondly, they bring out horrible behavior behind the keyboard/dice, as these are people who live out RL romantic fantasies in RP and take it  *very* seriously. Also I try and steer clear from people who insist you play the faceclaim they want of an actor they are crushing on for this exact reason. Eww. No thanks.",
