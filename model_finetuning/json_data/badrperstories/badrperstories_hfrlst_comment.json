It's not mature at all in the least because, literally, that's high school behavior. So no points to them for acting like rude-ass children. \n\nIt's not worth straining your mental energy by repeatedly stewing about their behavior... unfortunately, what's done is done, and the best thing you can do is just say \"well, fuck them, then,\" and let it go. Easier said than done, of course... but some people really are just shitty, and there's very little that can be done about that. \n\nDon't let shitty people consume your headspace. Flip 'em off and jettison them all into the stratosphere.",
