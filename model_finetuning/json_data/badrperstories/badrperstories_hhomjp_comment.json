These types also will usually not even read the full post they're responding to. They just choose the bits that fit their vision for their character and expect their scene partner or others in the server (if it's a group story) to fall in line.   \n\n\nThat ego will usually stay with them until they start being able to regularly bang out 5+ paragraphs. The first 3 can be descriptions of their character and what they're doing, thinking, wearing, or saying. Once they're regularly exceeding that, they're actually breaking apart their partner's post and responding, showing they're actually reading and collaborating.   \n\n\nThat also comes paired with a lot of elitism though. Once someone is in that tween range, they have their standards and no one is ever as good as them. If they see someone surpassing them, then it's \"calm down, I'm not here to read a book.\" But if their partner isn't matching them, then it's \"I'm a better writer than you, so fuck your rules, we're doing things my way.\"   \n\n\nThe easiest way to make sure your time isn't wasted is to put in a sort of code tucked into your advertisement. Something where part of the way through, in a seemingly redundant potion, you post \"If you've read this, when you message me, start your message with *I promose never to make you play with an anime character,\"* or something else like that so you have verification that they read everything. If they didn't send that, you know they probably just looked at the story you were looking for and your character's gender, and they're not what you want. Just don't respond.",

It's frustrating beyond words. \n\nI often get people who are into shipping characters and having solely romantic RPs, when I stated ***VERY*** clearly in my list of 'no no's', is that I don't like shipping in any sense, and I don't do romantic RP for the sake of it. In fact, I state in very plain English, I am looking for epic story, awesome plots and shed loads of character development. How is that hard to understand? Don't get me wrong, I am not totally against romance in RP so long as it's not forced (which I also ***very*** clearly state). But do they listen? Nope. I receive an onslaught of DMs, asking if I would be up for a romance plot with their OC... Annoying as hell.\n\nAlso, a quick side note about the anime side of things. I have lost count of people who present their characters in the genres of medieval fantasy, gritty urban crime, and Harry Potter as Anime characters. It drives me crazy. I While I can maybe every so often forgive an Anime faceclaim if the RP is good and fits the setting, but if my characters are interacting with someone who is blatantly a rip off anime character, my mood plummets. I don't know why... but I just can't deal with it.",
