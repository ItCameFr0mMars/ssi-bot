            "body": "I knew someone once who kind of ended up isolated despite how hard she tried to keep up the pace in various RP communities. She ended up giving up the RP hobby and started doing other kinds of things. This girl went out and got herself a license and a motorcycle, ha! I think, in her case, RP just wasn't her cup of tea, and once she left it, that's when she started going out more, meeting more people, and so on. \n\nSo... don't be afraid to contemplate that maybe the RP hobby just isn't working. This doesn't mean you have to give the hobby up forever. Maybe take a break from it for a while and get back to it a year or two from now. In my experience, it's hard to find an RP community that doesn't, at some point, become tumultuous. When you try to put a bunch of different people together in the same room, eventually personalities are going to clash in some capacity. That's the nature of the beast...\n\nYou can always write for yourself, too. All the ideas still swimming in your head, maybe try writing up some short stories. Make them into a series even. Something like that, maybe.",

I've had terrible experiences myself too, not similar to yours, but still of the same degree, that made me just want to give up RPing altogether for a while. I hope you can overcome the issues you have and that you may find someone that is going to be worth investing time into an RP with. It's very difficult to find someone like that, though. But I like to believe eventually people can get lucky if they keep trying. If you ever need someone to talk to, or something, feel free to contact me if you'd like.",
