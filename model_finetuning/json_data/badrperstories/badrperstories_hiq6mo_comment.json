            "body": "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. I prefer writing in more detail when I roleplay as well, and I have a friend who I no longer roleplay with because she gives short responses as well. \n\nI think your main issue is mostly communication. Tell your partner directly that you\u2019d like more effort from them, rather than hoping they get your hints. And, if that doesn\u2019t work, it may be an issue of differing expectations. Maybe your partner does roleplay to relax and have fun, and writing longer responses just takes too much out of them. Longer responses means thinking about those responses more, and maybe your partner just doesn\u2019t expect to write a novel with you when you both roleplay. \n\nEither way, if you feel like you\u2019re carrying the plot, definitely communicate this to your partner, and try to work things out from there. Maybe ask your partner to send their sentences more often, so you get more content even if their sentence length doesn\u2019t change. But if you have fun roleplaying with them, definitely try to find a solution so both of you can have fun, rather than it feeling one-sided. And, if all this doesn\u2019t work, then maybe before you start roleplaying with new partners, say up front what you expect so you won\u2019t have to go through this frustration as much. Hope this helped!",
