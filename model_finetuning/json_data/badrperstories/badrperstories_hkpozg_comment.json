I could launch into big ol' paragraphs about why my characters this or that. For a long while, I didn't realize I was doing it. But when I did realize it, I tried to make the effort to ask my RP partner about their characters. For one particular RPer, though, every time I would do this, she would never say much about her characters... I'd always feel kind of bad about that, because I *wanted* to know more about her characters, but she would just never get into too much detail over them. \n\nEventually we got to that point, too, where she would only answer my messages with \"XD\" over and over. I got the hint that she was done talking to me, so I backed off. I'm pretty sure I got on her nerves and came across as show offy and braggish. Not my proudest moments, but hopefully I've learned since then...",
