I'm not unreasonable, some little stuff makes sense in a quick paced action scene but you generally get a rapport with someone and set some boundaries and as long as the other person is as mature and respectful it can be fun but when I hear about people straight up God modding someone else's characters and changing their back story it boggles my mind. If you don't want me to have an individual character that I play, that granted you might not always like, write a story. Don't get into rp with you don't want someone else to have their own thoughts and actions. Go write fanfic.",
