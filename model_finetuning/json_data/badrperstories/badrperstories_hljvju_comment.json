            "body": "Moooooood. Moodiest of moods.   \n\n\nI run two lore heavy servers on discord, one of which is a magic one as well. We have a coded question in the application that people need to find the correct answer to in the lore to prove they read it all, or at least most of it. Without that, we won't even look at their application.   \n\n\nFor the rest, we tell people before they've even applied that most applications require 2-3 edits before they can be approved, largely because there are so many nuances to the lore. That keeps most people from telling us to just fuck off. Then we issue \"notes\" on the app for all the things that need editing. Some people will see the whole concept just doesn't work and will leave on their own, most will take the notes and edit.   \n\n\nI had one guy come in who has become a legend in my server. His OC was a time-traveling elf. The first thing you learn when reading our lore is that every character is human, also the mage classes are outlined and time magic doesn't exist. He kept saying that no one would know he was an elf and he wouldn't use the time-magic. We were like \"no, this character physically can't exist in this universe.\" He made a huuuuuge stink saying that we should allow people to bring in their OCs to see if they like the server before they apply and create something new. Um, no, dude. I screen shot that whole conversation so I can look back on it and giggle from time to time. Someone else tried to make a water mage with the fire-royal name, but the powers weren't water at all - they were a mix of air and beast magics - very clearly trying to make a mermaid. Oh, and the setting is a university, but her character was 15.   \n\n\nReading the lore is the minimum. I'm willing to work with players that have weird concepts to help them fit into the lore, but they need to meet me halfway by reading said lore and knowing the premise of what they're trying to join. It's mind-boggling to me how many role players are so adamantly opposed to reading, when that's at minimum half of the hobby.",
