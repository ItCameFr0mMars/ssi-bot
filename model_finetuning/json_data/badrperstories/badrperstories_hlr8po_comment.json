For example, if TV writes that his character picked up your character and threw them into a brick wall across the street, you could reply: \n\nWhen [TV's Character] went to grab [Fyrsiel's Character] in order to throw him across the street, [Fyrsiel's Character] instead just barely jumped backwards, out of [TV's Character's] reach, and darted around to throw another kick to [TV's Character's] side.\n\n\nIf TV has qualms with you making adjustments to his moves in your reply without asking him first, then you can make the point that he can't throw your character across the street in his reply without asking you first.",
