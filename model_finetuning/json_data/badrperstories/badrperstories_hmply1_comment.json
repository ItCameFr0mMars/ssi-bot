            "body": "Some advice from me for my subreddit rping:\n\n1) One of the big issues with novice rpers that can often lead to small posts is what I call \u201cflat action\u201d. Things like \u201cshe walked to the front\u201d or \u201cHe dodged the blow by ducking down, squatting down in order to then jump up and kick\u201d. The problem with these is that they are very purely mechanical, which is why they are both rather short and kind of perfunctory reading. Instead, something like, \u201cMustering all of her patience, Karen let her high heels sing with their typical indignant rage to show just how she felt as she haughtily clip-clopped her way to the front disk, her jaw already contorting with thoughts of verbal vengeance\u201d or \u201cAs Kyle saw the oncoming sword swing, his mind could only muster up one thought: *down*. Obeying in an instant, he felt the cold steel pass over his head, twinging a hair as it passed. He knew, however, that he had no time to think about how close he came to death, or he would die for real next time. Steadily, he pushed every ounce of adrenaline and rage into his legs, pushing himself into a tight squat to prepare for a deadly counter-attack\u201d. While a lot of that might be implied, it still helps to write it out, just to make sure. It also gives your fellow rper more information on your character to bounce off of in their follow-up post, which is more fun for everyone.\n\n2) Novice rpers don\u2019t spend a lot of time describing the thought process of the character in terms of how they interpret, or speak, certain lines of dialogue. No one just says *exactly* what is on their mind, so make sure to at the minimum hint at the subtext of your character\u2019s dialogue in your writing, and have fun with the subtext of the other person\u2019s dialogue, even drawing false conclusions or slow conclusions at points.\n\n3) The other character is your artifact. If you can\u2019t think of anything else to write, examine every little detail of them. Characters are only kinda interesting on their own, but get super interesting in how they interact with and perceive others. Something that the other rper even took for granted being a demonstration of the character difference can do wonders for demonstrating why your character is so unique. For instance, if they briefly mention that their character has a few flecks of mud on their face from a previous fight, you might want to hone in on that. Maybe your character sees that as a mark of weakness, or courage, or stupidity, or whatever, and you take a moment to elaborate on how the mud represents that.",
