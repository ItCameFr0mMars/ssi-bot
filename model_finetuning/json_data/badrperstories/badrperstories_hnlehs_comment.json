If they can offer multiple replies a day, I'll tell them we don't match, wish them the best and find another partner.\n\nThe whole catch is finding someone you can vibe with and has the same expectations and don't mind waiting for replies.",

Ghosting someone that you have been rping with for months (for the most part, obviously there are cases that warrant it) can be a bit iffy. If you have no intention to continue on the rp or need to go away for an extended period or time, just briefly letting them know seems like common curtesy imo. Past that point it is not your responsibility to justify yourself. If they get mad and require justification for you leaving, then they\u2019re likely overstepping their boundaries and you have no obligation to tell them anything. \n\nBut yeah. Solid, continuous rps are hard to come by. Good luck in your search! :)",

            "body": "I think I've also noticed a huge shift in the nature of RP over the course of years. When I first started out RPing, it was through MSN and AOL chatrooms (have I aged myself, yet? lol) and instant messengers. RPs were usually just spur of the moment, and usually didn't last more than the first night or two that we started. In this way, RP was super casual and you just did it when the mood hit. \n\nAfter a while, Forum RPs started to be the way to go, and I actually liked them pretty well. I could write more, get way deeper into my characters' psyche while they reacted to situations, etc. But this was also when I started noticing folks kind of camping out on me and waiting for me to sign on so they could immediately ping me for a reply. \n\nThen I started getting back into RP via social media, which was... extremely difficult to keep up with. On social media type of platforms, RP happened in real time, and it was so easy to get left behind. And folks really came down on you for replies, or they'd RP their characters getting mad at *your* character (as punishment) if you didn't log on for a day or two, god forbid a week... \n\nI found myself leaving my messenger status set to \"online\" all the time so that people could still leave me messages but never actually know if I was online or not, so I wouldn't have to answer them the second I got onto my computer. If not that, then I'd set my status to \"offline\" or \"invisible\" all the time... \n\nIt does seem like the RP setting has become more expectant. I had one RP partner, who I knew in person, once tell me that when I didn't sign on for a week, they were so worried that they were ready to call my house to see if I hadn't been in an accident or something... like... okay, thanks for the concern(?) but also holy shit, it was just one week... \n\nI've always said that RP should be fun, and once it starts to feel like a chore or a job, then it's high time to start thinking about cutting out.",

If they don\u2019t post that day all I want is for them to just tell me they won\u2019t post that day, which shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask. If you won\u2019t be able to post for a month just tell me and it\u2019s fine but I don\u2019t like it when people just vanish, and then you reach out with a simple hey or good morning and get nothing back. I know I have high standards but I use role play as an escape from day to day life, and only getting a few replies a week means it\u2019s about as much of an escape as an extrovert only getting to go out once a week.\n\nEdit: I should mention that I just see rp as a commitment because I do want a friendship out of it. I also just don\u2019t mix with a lot of people who can\u2019t at least chat once a week because I have a bit of social anxiety, but it\u2019s more of people leaving me behind. If I really enjoy the rp I\u2019m more willing to wait but I don\u2019t have anything else to keep me occupied in these times, all my classes will be online when college starts up, and I was going to work at my university but due to losses they can\u2019t even hire that many students, I\u2019m in a rut here.",

Since social media apps became more numerous and popular, and since people got phones, it's a lot easier to stay in contact, so I think that people tend to expect swifter responses and think that something is wrong when they don't get one. Not that it's a bad thing at all, I'm not griping, it's just an observation. \n\nI never take my profile off of 'offline', it's a nightmare if I'm actually showing when I'm there or not.

It's less about clinginess and more about time and compatibility.   \n\n\nYou're a leisure-paced player, and there's nothing wrong with that but you should make it clear to your scene partners on platforms that are geared toward a more active crowd, so they can know what to expect when they start writing with you.

I think you missed the point of this post or only read the first paragraph or two, which again is part of what I had issue with since nobody seems to want to read large pieces of text.\n\nI said it was clingy behaviour when you connect with someone who states outright that they don\u2019t want to be bothered for responses and that they\u2019re sluggish in replying, then proceed to bother the living hell out of them without respecting the boundaries they already set out. There is nothing wrong with wanting more than one post a day or a week. There is absolutely something wrong when you\u2019re messaging the person constantly to nag about it when you should know that the person is slow based off of what they said in the very beginning.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was entirely necessary to point out that people can pump out more responses than I can in a day, since that wasn\u2019t really the point of the post. I mean, good for them, but that\u2019s just not me. I am just way too busy (my decision, not trying to sound condescending) to sit at my computer typing away for many hours a day. Some days I don\u2019t even have time to get on the PC before I go to bed, and the last thing I\u2019m thinking about is letting them know I\u2019ll get to the post tomorrow, since I might not even get around to it that day either.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly where I had an issue when it comes to RPing, I always lay out that I\u2019m a super busy person that does RP super casually, but I always end up with people who didn\u2019t even read my profile, and I only learn they either didn\u2019t read my profile or didn\u2019t care when I start getting these messages and getting guff for not meeting the expectations they began to set that I was upfront about not being able to meet. It just sucks so much to know they skimmed my profile that hard and are mad at me for something I never promised them.",

With social media and phones allowing easier access to people, that expectation of an instant response has grown over time. Nowadays, people interpret a lack of response as meaning that something's wrong, but that isn't always the case. \n\nNowadays, oh yes, \"offline\" is my immediate default. Anytime I join some site that has a chatroom or messenger, I quickly try to track down the \"offline\" settings. It's like the first thing I look for, lol! \n\ntbh, I personally don't even like that obligation of having to say whether or not I will respond that day, or not for the next couple of days, or not for a week... Again, it's that expectation that starts to turn me off, personally, because sometimes I really can't predict when I'll next have the energy for a reply. Expectation and obligation is when it starts to feel like a chore rather than something you're doing for fun. On the other hand, though, I absolutely understand a person not wanting to be left hanging. I think it's kinda tough to find that happy medium. I suppose at the end of the day, it just amounts to compatibility.",

I state this in my search thread though. I also come up with lots of (\\*I think\\*) funny little scenes and like to share it with my partners and chat ooc. I like to send memes and make inspo boards and stuff, it's the kind of thing that really gets my creative juices flowing and allows me to stay invested. Do I expect the same level of effort back? No, but it's nice and really nothing brightens my day than if someone sends me a link to something on youtube and goes \"This reminded me of our game/ of one of our characters\". I outline this in my search threads and personally would never be able to stay invested in a game that I get one or two replies a week in unless I was HEAD OVER HEELS for the plot and characters.   \n\n\nDo I expect full length replies every day? Nah, maybe every other day though. Do I want someone who will at least CHAT with me every day? Preferably, especially if there is a lot more plotting that can be done. But IDK I guess I just actually *read* peoples search threads before I message them to make sure we are a good fit.   \n\n\nBeen there done that on the other person threatening suicide. I don't take it seriously, I've been there and done that. I send them the national suicide help line number and then politely end our partnership.

The **first thing in my bios** is about my activity, and I get people who want to message me every single day nagging me about posts because they have zero patience and didn\u2019t read what I put at the very top in bold about my activity requirements and the fact that I don\u2019t like to be pestered constantly. They try to take things personally when I don\u2019t respond that day, saying I *have* to let them know when I\u2019ll talk again, like it\u2019s a job requirement instead of understanding that people have lives that don\u2019t revolve around you and there are people who do not want to think about their partner and their RP every second of every day. The people that come to me threatening to hurt themselves or even kill themselves because I\u2019m too slow/didn\u2019t keep my promises/etc when I told them first thing what my activity will be. Do you think that kind of behaviour is acceptable to throw at other people because you need every second of your writing partners attention every minute of the day?\n\nYou chose to treat someone like shit because they don\u2019t RP like you do and the post offended you. You read nothing that I posted and instead took it personally while claiming \u2018you hate fun because you have a life and don\u2019t want to be on the PC every second of the day because **I** would want you to be\u2019. You are exactly the kind of rude, juvenile RPer I\u2019ve run into that make the hobby dogshit for everyone else. \n\nNobody is entitled to keep you occupied. Nobody is entitled to spend their whole day with you to be seen as \u2018fun\u2019. Stop expecting it of people when you don\u2019t even read a thing they post. Take time to read, instead of freaking out because not everyone does things just the way you do. There is no reason to be a cunt about something people do for fun. Seriously, grow up.",
