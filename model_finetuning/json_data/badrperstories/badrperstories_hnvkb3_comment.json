            "body": "I get what your saying in the first half, but the second half...I mean, I can tell you the reason why people ask 'So, what did you want to do with your plot?' Or at least the reason why I sometimes ask this question. \n\nA lot of times, I would join an rp group or ask someone to do 1x1 rp with me. I read their search thoroughly, thought about a lot of specific plot points and my character in detail. Then I would tell them my ideas...turns out they wanted romance to play a bigger part than the search made it seem like. So the character I had in mind was useless. Or I wanted to make a character that could not fight very well, but the person who searched was looking for an action character because the plot would later require it, without making it clear in the search. Or I would try to tell them about my ideas for a magic rp, but it turned out that they wanted to go a very different route with their magic than what I was thinking of while reading their search.\n\nThis was always very frustrating, because I had to rethink entire characters/made plotlines up that I would have known were unfitting if I had asked them which direction they want their plot to take. Yes, roleplaying is a joined effort, but you have to know the base your working with. Someone who does not contribute any ideas is annoying.\n\nBut it is also annoying if you come up with a lot of stuff that is useless in the end, just because you did not ask what direction the other person has in mind.",

The entirety of their posts are 95% of the time reiterating *exactly what you just wrote* and then thinking about it, with nothing to respond to. Even in a battle scene, where a friend of theirs is literally being ripped in half, all they can manage is a milquetoast rehashing of the post before theirs and wondering what they should do.\n\nIt's exhausting, and I hope you find someone better to write with.",
