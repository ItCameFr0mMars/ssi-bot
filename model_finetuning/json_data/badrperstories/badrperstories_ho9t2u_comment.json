The first time, he wasn't even in the server for a full 10 minutes before he started telling me everything I'm doing wrong with it and all the ways he could run it better. I'm not usually a fan of banning, but when someone like that comes in - I know I'm not going to want to deal with them and I definitely know my other mods won't either.   \n\n\n*Not for you, bye-bye.*  \n\n\nHe came in on another account in the same amount of time it takes to create an alt account lol and was a little nicer this time, but soon started asking the same boneheaded questions and making suggestions no one asked for. I was afk, and when I came back, my mods were talking about what a jerk the guy was and the written tones were so similar to the first one. I banned him again.   \n\n\nAnother account came in about an hour later, one of my mods kicked him for the same thing.   \n\n\nI don't get it. If it's so bad, fucking leave and make your own!!! Literally no one asks for his advice. People like that are the worst.",
