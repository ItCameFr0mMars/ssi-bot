I\u2019ve been really into a specific RP with a longtime partner, and each of the posts we\u2019ve been sending each other lately has been from 400-2000+ words.\n\nShe wakes up earlier than I do, and I stay up later than she does, so we each make sure the other has a post to wake up to. It makes each of our respective mornings. Gets the day started off right... Even if the content of said posts have recently driven us both to tears writing *and* reading them. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like novella posts, that\u2019s fine. But for those of us who enjoy them, it\u2019s invigorating. Every post becomes a treat. Novella posts take time to write. It\u2019s nice to know that your partner would rather spend that time crafting for you than whatever else they could be doing.\n\nThen again maybe I\u2019m just a romantic. In my ads, I always do mention that I consider myself a *writer* before I do a *role player*.\n\nAnd yes, there is a difference.",

It's just that sometimes when I see a wall of text and I'm not in a writing mood - it's sooooo daunting. My muse just nopes tf out.   \n\n\nI think my preference is something like 3-5 paragraphs shot back and forth. I type pretty fast, so i can definitely get that out in 15-20 minutes and still consider it within the realm of rapid fire. I just assume I'm not a \"good enough writer\" to derive pleasure from sending an essay each time. Some people do, and that's great. I will keep trying and maybe one day, I'll get there. For now, I try to limit how often I write with her because I need to be in a very specific head space to match that.",

            "body": "While the idea of writing lengthy posts to one-up a partner definitely sounds very unappealing and is a bad way of structuring an RP, I have to say that long posts are often both necessary and more rewarding than shorter ones. The rich details, the internal monologue, the gestures, and the non-verbal cues of the characters often-times make a story. Slow burn romance relies on these things heavily, but so do a lot of other genres. There's nothing more frustrating that a short post because, without those details, it's hard to write a reply to the other person. \n\nAs a writer, I can't get to know my partner's character without the details and they help not only move the story forward but also ground it in a world, set a tone, and create conflict. I would never recommend discarding details for the sake of shortening a post.\n\nAnd there are times when I've chatted with partners about shorter, dialogue-heavy posts. But here's the thing: real people don't just talk. We blink and smile and laugh. We stare off into space. We notice relevant and irrelevant details about the environment around us. We fiddle and fidget. We think ahead and reminisce. Sharing these same hints through one's writing not only helps hone a writer's skills, but it also allows the other partner to catch a glimpse of a fuller, more in-depth character.\n\nSo yeah, my two cents: write a lot, add the details, don't stress too much if they're over-the-top. Your partner will thank you.",

            "body": "It's difficult to put the difference into words, because it's something intensely personal and difficult to understand until you've reached that level in your own development, but I'll try to explain it.\n\nWriter is to roleplayer as expert is to hobbyist, in a sense.\n\nAs a child, I loved to read. This was in the nineties and early aughts, and while I did enjoy video games quite a bit, *each time* the Scholastic book order forms came out (shit, do they still have those?) I would get at least three or four and devour them *voraciously*. I had good grades in school, but I got into trouble a *lot* for not paying attention because I would try to sneak reading books in class during lessons.\n\nBefore I got started roleplaying as a teenager, I had cut my teeth writing stories on my own time. I'm not entirely certain if they qualify as *good*, really, but before I reached highschool, I had typed out, I believe, a good two thousand single-spaced pages of writing. I would maybe share a few of them with family, but even that was rare, and to this day, I have an enormous file of documents that I move to every PC I get that contains just, hundreds upon hundreds of pages of this stuff I wrote. Fantasy, science fiction... Well, mostly fantasy and science fiction were the two genres in which I specialized, if I'm honest.\n\nThe first time I ever did something that I could consider to be a roleplay, it was with a friend from highschool, and we called it 'writing a novel together'. We'd message our new parts to each other on AIM. I wrote much more and faster than he did, and I got upset when he didn't write anything for a while.\n\nWhen I encountered actual roleplay online, my first thought was 'Oh, it's like writing a novel together'.\n\nI said I wrote two thousand pages before I started roleplaying. I've probably written ten thousand since, and not only in roleplay. Thinking about this got me nostalgic, and I went back and looked through some of the RPs I did as a teenager. Before I had left college, I had written one with a partner, and the raw single-spaced document is 1006 pages. 618,000\\~ words. Another one I did with that same person was just shy of 200 pages. Both of *those* were last updated in May of 2009, because we had a huge falling-out, but I had fallen into the habit of keeping *everything*, so I still have those, as well.\n\nThe one I alluded to up there, with my dear friend, is copied and pasted in a google document by her; I guess that's where she keeps it. It got to 515 pages before it started to crash her browser, and so half a year back she made a new one. I don't know how long that one is. I'd wager it's at least 100 pages on its own merit. Actually, I just checked... Yesterday at 5:03 AM I sent her a post, and since then, we've written 13 single spaced pages in the span of six replies. All right, maybe 300 pages, then.\n\nThat RP alone is not the first we've done. We always have a few running simultaneously. I believe that this is the one we've written in the *most*, but by this point we've likely written a dozen novels in terms of length.\n\nIn between the roleplaying, I've won NaNoWriMo five or so times. I still write stories on my own. They're better than they used to be. I read a lot of books, and when I see a writing style I really enjoy, I tuck it away somewhere in the back of my mind until I find the opportunity to work that into my personal style.\n\nBut I don't have one style for writing. I have as many styles as I have characters, and then some. With the more educated or intellectual characters, I might make my prose a bit more eloquent, add a few superfluous words here and there, run it on a bit longer than it perhaps has to be, because the way in which a sentence is written can itself be a part of the characterization. I enjoy challenges such as this. I, as anyone, have archetypes I like to stick to, but I'll also seek out opportunities to step outside of my comfort zone and write a character very different from myself or anything I've done for the challenge of it.\n\nI suppose that's the difference, if you break it down. I, funnily enough, worked it out in the act of writing this incredibly long reply to you, and that is *itself* the difference.\n\nTo a *roleplayer*, the act of writing is not *as* enjoyable as the story. It might be fun, but their ultimate goal is to see the story move forward, and they know that when they post, they will get a post in return, which will do exactly that. In the worst case, the writing of a reply is a chore.\n\nTo a *writer*, the act of writing is *just as important* as the story. Making a beautiful story is a worthy endeavor and a very enjoyable pasttime. But a writer also knows that a beautiful story is enhanced by beautiful writing, and takes the time to do so, and tries experimenting with techniques and words and styles all the while, and enjoys every moment of it. Writing is never a chore, and composing a post is as enjoyable as receiving one.\n\nFor a more obtuse example of the same principle, merely for shits and giggles, observe this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs600U6OJJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs600U6OJJo)\n\nThe person who sees this and thinks, 'why would anyone put this time and effort into something that will be eaten in three bites, or will go bad if it is not eaten?' is the roleplayer.\n\nThe person who sees this and *understands* the reasoning behind putting the time and care into something so ephemeral is the writer.",

Even if my character doesn't know what they're thinking, I as a writer will become more invested in the other character when I have a good grasp on what they are like. Stuff like long clothing descriptions and whatnot seem pretty useless though unless there's a detail which sticks out.

            "body": "Thank you for explaining what you see as the difference between being a writer and a roleplayer. Definitely interesting food for thought. I think there's certainly something to be said for the quality of writing, and if I'm treated to a wall of text that also happens to be really amazing prose that I just want to get lost in, then no, I certainly wouldn't have a problem with that. I'd eat that right up! \n\nWhen you find a talented partner to roleplay with, it really IS just like writing a novel together, except one where you get to \"inhabit\" the characters and write half of it yourself. I happen to be immersed in a really fun saga right now, going on about 6 months now, and we've collectively written upwards of 470K words since then. But we've also established a good enough rapport by now that we know when to wax long and descriptive, and when short &amp; sweet is best. \n\nBut it just seems that, in my forays into RP with other partners lately, there's definitely a trend toward that \"more is more\" idea, and it's daunting. I'd love to see folks embrace a little more variety in their post-length, but perhaps that warrants a direct conversation about it.\n\nI also liked what you said about changing the prose or style of writing per character. I try to do that too, and notice that I'll tweak the wording of things or choose simpler terms for a less intellectual, down-to-earth type, versus busting out the thesaurus for my more polished, educated types. Sometimes even those minor changes help you inhabit the head-space of a character a bit better.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the philosophy on writing versus roleplay! I enjoy getting into in-depth conversations about this craft, so I appreciate your thoughts on it.",

If you are an experienced writer, you can say plenty with one sentence. In most circumstances, you shouldn\u2019t need to, as your partner\u2019s post should provide you with plenty of content to work from, but you still can.\n\nAs an aside, being a traditionally published author, I think this \u201chigh word count = literate\u201d nonsense invokes some bad habits that will be tough to break should an author ever want to transition from roleplay to short story or novels. If I saw someone dumping useless detail in their prose, prompting no intrigue in me as the reader, I would skip it in the slush pile. I imagine industry professionals would as well. \n\nFor that reason, I would not want to roleplay with someone who thinks word count is king. They sound inexperienced, and I personally think this is a red flag that the writing would be boring, though I do understand it comes from exposure to young preteen writers who don\u2019t have a grasp of writing yet and will write one or two poorly crafted sentences. Still, it seems unfortunate to target the wrong issue. \n\nIn the industry, say YA, if the target range is 65k-90k for a manuscript, and you hand over one that\u2019s 150k and think that makes you a better writer because it\u2019s longer, I have unfortunate news for you... you come off as amateur, and if you ever expect to move forward, you will be expected to cut that fat. And that is what it is\u2014fat. Sure, there are some authors that are the exception, who will grip the reader from their first page and craft all elements of their story beautifully enough to need all 150,000 words, but it\u2019s not likely that\u2019s the case in 99.999% of cases.\n\nSo yeah, I do worry that it infuses bad habits into writers who may someday want to move on to professional work. TL;DR: Quantity is not quality.",

Right now I'm writing an RP, and even though I really like the story, the length of replies is really bogging the whole thing down. The other person has set a personal goal to put 4,000 words per reply, and it usually takes me over an hour to reply. So what happens is I'll try to match this wall of text, the other person will reply within a few hours, then it will usually be a week or more before I feel ready to tackle another reply of that length. I do like the story but the wall of text and the extra fluff just to get a reply that long is really grinding the whole thing to a halt. :(",
