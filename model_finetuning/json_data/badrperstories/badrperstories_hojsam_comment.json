But when someone ignore your messages, is constantly online and only replies once a week then backtracks and says \"sorry I was busy\" even though I can see they were playing Rainbow Six Seige, that's a bit of an issue for me. If you want to spend a day without RPing, that's cool! LMK and we're all good, but don't keep me waiting, blank me for days on end and then act like I'm a dick for getting frustrated. RP as a hobby requires the other person/people to be engaged. If you're not interested, let me know and then leave, there's no hard feelings! Communication is key, and its a shame how few people actually bother to engage in conversation with the partner to let them know \"hey, I'm going away for a week\" or \"hey, I don't feel like RPing today.\"",

            "body": "Honestly I think the answer is to stop placing so much value on them once they make it obvious you are not of equal value in their priorities. I don't think you need to drop them or whatever else, nothing dramatic, but lower them on your priority list and stop always being the one to poke and double message. Basically just carry on with your life, and if they want to roleplay with you, they can take a turn approaching you. If they don't approach you, then you have your answer and you've already moved on and filled your life with other things and roleplayers you enjoy.\n\nI know this is easier said than done, I've been there before, but it *is* honestly the answer. They are showing you that you are not a priority to them; that's not necessarily malicious or pointed at all on their part, it's just the truth. And if it's not that and really is just something else entirely, then given a bit of time they will start approaching you more and you can just pick up then. (And if it's often and for longer than that, then even if it's not that you're not a 'priority' for them, then operationally it is the same. Stop existing in a holding pattern for people who don't make an effort to meet you halfway.) \n\nYou are feeling anxious and left out because of differing levels of investment and expectations, so adjust your expectations of them, and just move along. Later if they come back you can pick up some more RP and such if you wish, but if you're not into it by then, tough luck for them.\n\nRight now you are in a place where you are overthinking things, and placing far too much mental energy and time into worrying about things like that message on twitter and *what if they saw and--*. Drop the rope in the game of tug of war, or at *least* match the level of tugging they are doing. Once you adjust and find some people on the same wavelength as you, you'll feel much happier and much more stable overall.",

            "body": "you're right and in this particular fandom on Tumblr some people have been getting anon hate which is understandable they want to back away. Then some people only want to from the start or later on only roleplay with people they know which I understand too. Some accounts are very popular and it's obvious but seeing them reply to posts they are tagged in multiple times a day to the same several people but to only hear from them after days or even a week or not without a double-message is frustrating. I'm going to stop checking on them now and I never followed to begin with unless they followed me first. Some end storylines and then have way less they say and don't accept more. So with that happening its unusual, they wouldn't reply for quite awhile till you reach out again. Sometimes they can go days without posting or responding to tags or reblogging anything so they could be dealing with personal issues. They could just forget since there are so many messages they probably get. A lot of people should stop being and sounding thirsty too. Similar storylines can get boring. Health problems can affect them too. Maybe they completely black out or forget to reply and mental health or even physical can add to this. I'm wondering if I should ask them for a birthday shoutout this weekend at least a day before my birthday. I know it would be nice to get a reply but I will be ok if I don't get one. Some of them come back and apologize after not messaging you back for awhile. Sometimes they say they aren't in mood to roleplay especially nsfw and I know that feeling too. No matter how available they seem we really don't know how busy they are or what they are going through in real life especially with everything happening in the world now. I realized the roleplay accounts I use to message some of these same accounts who I double messaged or just never heard back from after a bit even after another message it turned out they did the same to my other roleplay character accounts not just my original character. Seems like a pattern and that they do it to other people. Some anons said the same thing to them too about waiting on responses and getting ignored. These characters are kind of popular and I'm sure people's inboxes can be pretty full usually. I think tumblr should have it so where if you read a message it still shows up as unread until you reply then you won't be able to forget.",

There's a whole other level of weirdness that comes with specifically tumblr indie RP that I haven't experienced on other platforms. Every platform has its own quirks, but the tumblr indie scene was on another level.\n\nI do recommend that you stop checking on them, and find people who are less \"popular\"/in demand, and set up your own social circles there with people in the same situation as yourself. I have found that often the desire to roleplay with the accounts that already have a visible and active circle of friends is tempting, but can come with some hurt feelings.\n\nIt's often simpler to find other people who are also struggling to find partners, and to build up your own base of people with the same goals and engagement levels.\n\nGood luck!",

Already after double messaging them they respond and say notifications weren't working. I asked them how they were OOC and they didn't even ask how I was. They also responded to the storyline. I replied Tuesday night and said I've been dealing with slight depression but I'm starting to feel better. They still haven't answered but tagged people in posts on their profile as recent as Wednesday. I feel like I'm being played like a fool and I feel like a loser.

            "body": "&gt; having to see them do it on their profile even talking to a friend who roleplays them is hurtful.\n\nIt definitely is. I've had it happen to me on there before as well. Honestly as sad as it is, you just don't seem to be a priority to them, so it's definitely time to stop going out of your way for them. They don't value you. \n\nI'd bet it's just that they have their priorities elsewhere and they don't mean it unkindly at all. It's just the way it is. Perhaps later on you'll find yourself in that position with people who would like to RP with you, but you only have so much motivation and energy and you just vibe with other RPs more. But it still sucks to feel that way. I once typed out an honestly banger of a starter personalized for someone that wanted it, based on a drabble they did, and they promised they wanted to RP that scene before I wrote it and they seemed really excited, then just nothing. It sucks.\n\nYou need to move on and find people who value you in the same way you value them. I wouldn't ask for any kind of shoutout, personally, because I feel like that's the sort of thing that people should do organically. If you're close friends then it might be okay to ask (but then you likely wouldn't need to since they'd know and want to do it on their own), but if you're not (and it sounds like you're not) then it puts them in an awkward position. \n\nYou sound young, and there's nothing wrong with that, but take this lesson early on, and stop trying to force something that just isn't working. It's a lesson I wish I had taken on board *far* earlier than I did.",

            "body": "I'm not sure if I know who they are behind the roleplay but due to their writing style matching someone else's I think I might know. Notifications not working and other excuses they are making should stop. They don't know its my birthday unless I tell them. I don't know many people on my tumblr so I don't feel like posting this weekend that its my birthday. I have done it in the past to be faced with radio silence from everyone pretty much and I have over 5000 followers on my tumblr now. I don't know if they are doing it to other people. My friend said that account talks to her here and there when we were having a general banter and talk about roleplay. They said they don't want to put pressure on them and it seems they are going through stuff but they don't have the problems with this person and double messaging like I do. If it is the person I think it is I've barely talked to them before but they are in their 30s they need to be honest. And this person has chronic pain syndrome if it is the right girl which I think it is. I just announced a week hiatus on one of my roleplay accounts and I'm starting to feel a bit better. I have other people to roleplay with but I'm not sure how long that will last. This person has said they gave serious thought for 2 weeks about either deleting their account or ending storylines and that was a month ago so they ended other peoples who were newer and turned off anons. The first 3 weeks or so I was talking to them it was great then came the excuses. My other friend tagged them in stuff but that stopped 2 months ago. They tag roleplayers they talk to frequently in posts but I think this person did to them what they are doing to me now. Maybe they will end up deleting their roleplay account and accounts in general in this fandom are dropping like flies especially roleplay one's..",
