She somehow knows his very specific inner musings. My character, Edgelord McGee enters the scene. He's up in a tree looking down but hasn't made a move because being an edgelord, he wants to watch them fight. Action girl somehow teleports up into the tree behind Edgelord McGee (\"Nothing person, kid\" style) and somehow knows he's evil. She's got the drop on Dude and Edgelord McGee, even though one is in a tree and the other is on the forest floor. The thread dies, Dude and I decide to make a closed thread for ourselves. Action Girl was friends with the moderators so we didn't bother pressing the issue.",
