It feels like they're not really there to roleplay with me or the character I've created, and honestly, when this happens, I feel like it almost always goes down the rabbit hole of the other person writing for my character (because they want certain things to go a certain way, I suspect). \n\nFace claims can be kind of fun, though. Although if a particularly pretty actor/actress shows up on the big screen, there's a better than fair chance that someone will be using THAT face! :(",

            "body": "I'd only gotten back into RP earlier this year, so there was a lot of terminology to acclimate to (my heavy RP days had been back in the 90s/00s, previously, when the use of images was less prevalent), and face-claims was one of the things that tripped me up. Sure, even back in the early pioneer days of online roleplay, there was a trend to picture your character as some ridiculously gorgeous actor/celebrity, but it wasn't quite as focused as it is now. And for me, it's also hard sometimes to settle on just *one* face for a character. I'll think more in general terms, like oh, he/she has kind of a similar look as these actors, like if you blended them together. But I still want the *writing* to convey the character, so for me, face-claims are just the icing on the cake, but not the cake, y'know?\n\nWhen I run into potential partners who are too focused on face-claims, it sends up a red flag. I also didn't realize that there's sometime a trend to *include* the face-claims in your posts. And to sometimes include many different ones, like, oh, *this* is the expression for *this* scene, and here's what he/she is wearing here (insert image), etc. Like, I get that the visual medium can be helpful, and believe me, I'm as guilty as anyone of creating endless Pinterest boards for inspiration. But what happened to focusing on the *writing*? Is this a picture book, or are we telling a story?\n\nI feel like the writing should come first. And if someone tries to insist on a particular face-claim, for me, before we even start? I'm out.",

Personally, I hate the practice-- it's *very* difficult to find photos of normal looking people, and to be honest, I get very bored with roleplays where I need to imagine everyone as a perfect instagram model. The availability of these pictures also seems to affect the sort of characters that people tend to play, because if all you can find when you look for photos are sexy young models, well, I suppose that's what you're gonna be playing, innit?\n\nFor that reason, along with the sort of people who you describe in your post, I don't roleplay with people who *demand* face claims, full stop.
