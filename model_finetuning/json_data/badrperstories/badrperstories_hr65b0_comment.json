I think he really was excited for the RP. He probably did love your character.\n\nThings just come up, and they can send an RPer's fragile inspiration into a tailspin. He didn't give you much information about what was going on, so it could be anything.\n\nIf I were you, I think I would send one more message. I'd make sure to phrase it something along the lines of, \"Hey! I just wanted to say I hope you are well and that things are starting to get better. You don't have to respond to this message; I just want you to know I'm thinking of you and sending good vibes your way.\"\n\nIt might brighten his day; it might let him know that you'll be around if he does feel inspired again soon. Sometimes after an awkwardly long lull, RPers are afraid to reach back out in case they've pissed off their partner. This will show him you aren't stewing.\n\nYou can wait as long as you want. If the server sitting there doesn't bother you, leave it indefinitely! If you're itching to get rid of it, wait whatever time you would like (you've waited long enough already to justify this at any point) and possibly give him some warning. \"Hey, I am going to delete/leave the server just to clean up my list. If you ever want to pick this back up, just shoot me a DM/friend request!\"\n\nI wouldn't continue checking in every few days, as it might begin to make him feel stressed. Not that you are stressful (you sound like a lovely RP partner!), but he might take your concern as you pushing him to \"snap out of it\" and continue the RP.\n\nI hope you get to pick up this RP again and that you guys have a lot of fun! If not, don't worry; as frustrating as it is to have to \"start over,\" you'll find your perfect RP match.",

As he said, he takes ghosting seriously and wouldn't do that.   \n\n\nI think you should factor in that we're knee deep in the Summer Slump, where most muses for whatever reason, start to dip. On top of that, the quarantines are making muses nose dive as their writers grow lethargic from the lack of social interactions. Those are two things that are effecting *everyone*, not just role players. Then you add in that a lot of role players have anxiety, depression, BPD, PTSD, or any number of mental health disorders. When you mix mental health disorders into Summer Slump and Pandemic Stew, you get muse death.   \n\n\nIt's not you. Your story probably is really, really great, and he's probably kicking himself for not being able to get it together enough to get online and write with you. I know it sucks to be really excited about a story, just to have it sputter out, but please remember the human behind the character. You already told him you're here if he needs to talk. Maybe he's not ready to talk. Give it time.   \n\n\nYou can have multiple servers on Discord. What's the harm in keeping that door open for him, which it sounds like he needs, while also looking for something else to supplement in the meantime? I'd give it a few more days, because you don't want him to feel rushed and then internalize that to mean he's failing you. If two weeks go by, send him a small \"Hey, just wanted to reach out and send positive thoughts your way. I'm here if you need me.\" No mention of the story, he's your friend, he comes first. In the meantime, respond to someone else's ad, spark another story. Creativity doesn't exist in a vacuum, in fact the more you write, the more you'll be inspired to keep writing. There's millions of other minds out there you can write with and create something with, while you're still being there for him.",

Servers that launch in the Summer tend not to last into Autumn, but servers that launch in Autumn can easily last into Winter and then get a huge spike in post-holiday players that will stay on through the following year. \n\nMy theory is that in summer time, there's less restrictions on schedules. Much as I'm sure we all love sleeping in and lounging about, without the structure of a school schedule, we grow lazy or even lethargic. Our muses tell us \"eh, we can reply tomorrow\" over and over, and before we know it - it's a month later and we feel awkward about saying \"hey, sorry, I want to keep playing, I just also wanted to sleep a bunch and binge Tiger King.\"",

He does seem to truly care, and probably feels awful about not being able to post, so he also may feel apprehensive about talking, since that may make him feel like a post is expected in that case.   \n\n\nI've dealt with partners going through a funk, and have been there before myself as well. If he really didn't care, I am pretty sure he wouldn't respond to you when you try to initiate a conversation and such either, which he has. I think it is definitely be worth a shot to wait, and perhaps let him know you're cool to wait until he feels better and that in the meantime you're more than happy to have a nice chat whenever he wants to! And as others have said, try to just find some other partners/things to do stuff with in the meantime!",
