Issue was that they were friends with many of the people in my group. However they kept ignoring the rules. They'd have false thoughts to try and meta influence others to win a trial (it was a murder mystery RP) and when asked to stop in OOC they would literally tell me to go fuck myself. Now I'm easy going but I don't put up with that kind of stuff. I had put up with enough for this person to issue a permanent ban. They had been sufficiently warned many times. The RP was suffering from it massively too. This wound up in almost the entire group to attack me for being too harsh in their eyes. Which was ridiculous and I wound up unbanning this person due to peer pressure but it never got better. The worst part is this was supposedly a girl who was the girlfriend of one of the guys in the group. But me and some few people who weren't part of the crew that were close to them were pretty sure \"she\" was fake and just played by the guy who supposedly dated her...\n\nBut yeah. I wish I had just stood my ground back then. It wasn't worth it. As to what you should do? I don't have an answer. Your scenario could wind up differently but ultimately I think if it makes people leave then they're not worth fuzzing about. In the end it's her fault for not acting proper. Especially if she's been warned and made aware. I hope you can sort this out by talking to some people! Best of luck! Please post an update when you can how it's working out for you.",
