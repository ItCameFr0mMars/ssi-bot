I'm usually lengthy too when it comes to posts, and I know some people I've RPed can get intimidated by it because they feel they need to meet the same *standard*, but when I manage to ensure them I am pretty easy going and not very demanding and they experience that I really am, they relax. I've never had anyone get so childish or petty about the size of my posts though. If any, I wind up having people telling me it was a nice read, and apologizing for not being able to deliver the same thing. To which I tell them it's fine, and that I am just happy they've enjoyed it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have gotten annoyed at long posts myself though, I have to admit. Not because I don't like to read, on the contrary. But it's about what a post contains, after all, and not its size. My posts tend to be long because they also describe emotions, thoughts, motivations, that my character goes through and has in regards to situations that go on and what other characters are doing and saying. It's filled with feeling. I figures this is what probably keeps partners invested and interested, able to enjoy the read. It's always nice to see what a character thinks about yours and to get pulled into emotions like that, after all. At least, to me it is! But I honestly don't know if that's it! Maybe they're just being polite, but people I've been RPing with for a long time I know to be genuine about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, yeah,  I've gotten annoyed (only internally) at long posts that are littered with nothing but filler, pointless dragged out details, that only seem to be there to make the post long. The ones that are void of any emotions or immersion, the ones that reveal nothing about how a character feels, thinks, their motivations. You know the type? Those kind of post that take 2 paragraphs to describe how a character's hair is dancing in the wind and how the moonlight cascades down on it with a lot of fancy synonyms that only make it more ambiguous than readable.  \n\n\nBut, even **if** your long posts are like that, I see no reason for them to have been so rude either way. There never is an excuse for poor behavior, and to act in such a nasty manner towards your character IC. They definitely are also the kind of RPers I would get tired of really fast with how generic, illogical, and based on anime their takes on things seem. Like that red eye thing? LMAO PLZ. Sounds like a bunch of kids you wound up with.",

No, but I'm working on it and I get better all the time. I almost never describe what my character looks like. I'd much prefer to drop an outfit board to be like \"this is what they look like today\" and then everything in my posts is stuff that can actually be responded to.\n\nSince posting this thread, the scene moved on a bit. The glaring stopped, thanks to the GM stepping in and adding more context to the scene. Now, the annoying thing is that everything my character *thinks* is responded to.\n\nCop walks in and orders a beer while another cop is sitting at the bar already drunk. My character *thinks* about how it's probably not a good sign that the only cops in that small town are currently getting drunk, wondering who will drive them home. Suddenly both cops are just drinking water, when a second ago, one was 4 pints deep and the other was looking to do the same.\n\nBar Manager wipes his nose with his hand and goes back to serving, my character *thinks* about how he should wash his hands because that's unsanitary. Next post, the manager's washing his hands.\n\nIt's little stuff like that where I'm starting to feel like it's just me and the GM doing all the heavy lifting and it's not super fun.

            "body": "Unlearning stuff is definitely even harder than learning new stuff, for sure. Kudos to you for learning and doing that, though! I also get that a lot of RPers do learn the ropes from people who do the 'ambiguous poetry' as I tend to call such a writing style. So I can empathize/understand, but it's when they wind up stuck in that thinking it's perfect when it becomes a problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to be on a platform where almost everyone would write that way, and I can only imagine it's because most people picked it up from others on there since it was the norm. This is random, but those types of posts, are usually easy to spot when they start off with: \"he/she would.\" I already am like: Ho boy, here we go again. I don't get it. \"He would?\" So, did he, or did he not? What're you trying to say!? \n\nIt's alright if it's the product of not being aware yet, but when it's one of those people who are not open minded, claim they're amazing at novella RP, and get mad and have to point out how they do T1 novella and what not when you try to make a friendly suggestion or just say you're not interested to RP with them, because you know they're never going to learn or be open to suggestions, then it's not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened a lot. It sounds crazy, but some of them would leave angrily and then even send in their friends, whom I'd never met, to go to my RP room to try and bash me for not wanting to RP with their friend and how I wish I was as elite as them so that I should have been honored and stuff. It would honestly just amuse me because I mean, what else am I supposed to do with something that silly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah, I am far from perfect either in my writing but I think no one is? I think key is though, to not become arrogant and think you are perfect, to always aim to improve! I have RPed with people who sometimes can't manage more than one line, but are willing to learn, so I am fine with it in that case. In the end, attitude is the deciding factor in whether or not I'll put up with someone in an RP. I've had people ask me to teach them too, and I love doing that, even if I don't think I am that great, but helping is always nice! As you say; 'I'm happy to lead by example, but only if others are receptive to that.' And that is exactly it for me as well.\n\nIt sounds to me, like them using your thoughts like that in their posts is just a more inconspicuous way to still aggravate/troll you. Even if it would not be deliberate, that is seriously aggravating. I'd personally stop wasting my energy on them. RPing is a hobby which should be enjoyable, after all. Still, I am sorry that you wound up with it turning out to be like this, after thinking you've found an RP where you could finally play a character you've been wanting to use for so long.",

            "body": "It's funny you mention the \"he/she would\" bit. I only ever see that in what I would call legitimately *bad* writing. Across the board, it's always the same. One sentence, they *would* do a thing, and usually they're using Ye Olde English in a generally modern setting. Without fail, these people will refer to bartenders as \"tenders\". Amusingly, that habit is picked up from typically combat oriented stories where you want to post, but you also want to leave it open ended for the other person to counter. \"He would fire his weapon to shoot Trogdor in the face.\" To which, Trogdor can then say \"He tried to, but Trogdor dodged,\" or some other such. I understand the logic behind it, but the circles that use it are typically people I just don't have the patience to write with. That said, I've never seen that writing style in anyone even close to novella. I think the most length I've seen from someone who *would-write* (lol) is maybe a single paragraph.   \n\n\nRegarding them using it as an inconspicuous way to troll me, in ooc they've been nothing but friendly. I hate to say it, but I genuinely don't think they're smart enough to have that as their motive.   \n\n\nI did manage to ~~con~~ talk a friend in to applying with me, so I have someone to write with now. I've also been helping them create banners and find new places to advertise. I'm not going to give up, because when the GM steps in, I genuinely do enjoy myself, and I can see instances where the other two are pushing themselves to try and match me - which is a really positive scene. I'm more than willing to cut back on my posts to meet them half-way if it's to push the story, if we're all still having something fun-adjacent. It's only been a few days since the launch, and we've gotten some new people in. Maybe cross your fingers and send good vibes?",

            "body": "You're right. It stems from combat oriented stuff. The T1 and such. But yeah these people use it for everything. And unfortunately I've had the pleasure of reading walls of text of the stuff. \n\nAnd yeah. I can see it being \nnot deliberate. I've a friend who would mimic stuff I'd do in my posts too. Even personal stuff. Such as my character having an emotional attachment to a certain object that was a remnant of their past and someone they've lost. Suddenly that friend's character had melancholic feelings in regards to the same object which had nothing to do with that character nor was it any link to anything for their character. It was not deliberate but I pointed it out and they've been trying to refrain from this habit. So yeah, I know there are people who just... do that somehow. \n\nI'm glad it's turning out to go better. Best of luck, hope it stays this course for you!",
