It wasn't till we actually got onto discord that he claimed that he could only rp with a woman because he was straight. He also kept asking that if he played a male character, cause it was what he was comfortable with, if I'd still wanted to rp the romance part of the spot I specifically said would happen no matter the pairing. When my answer was yes he proceeded to go on a tirade on how he didn't think we were compatible but the moment I pointed out he'd contributed to nothing at all and all his \"points\" were lies he then proceeded to tell me what essentially was him hoping that I'd change the plot and the character I played to suit his needs. I blocked him after politely informing him that one simply does not try to guilt another into an rp.",
