I feel like most people are idk the word, socially aware enough to understand that they can't just make these general assumptions about people.  \n\n\n Like, if you took out the trans stuff and instead applied a race or ethnicity to this, then it'd be really clear that she's racist, right? If instead of being a trans woman, you were a Hispanic woman, for example. And then she said \"I had a bad experience with a Hispanic person once, so I assume you're like that too and have been taking it out on you.\" or other things she said like \"I don't like Hispanic people.\" That would be pure and simple racism.   \n\n\nNow you apply it to your situation as a transwoman. That's, pure and simple, transphobia. It's hate and it's toxic. If she's willing to learn and grow from this, then great. But I don't think it's going to get better. She sounds like a bigot.",

Generalizing is inexcusable, you cannot apply one bad thing that happened with one bad person to an entire group of people and still call yourself a decent human being. In a situation like that, they should get therapy, absolutely.
