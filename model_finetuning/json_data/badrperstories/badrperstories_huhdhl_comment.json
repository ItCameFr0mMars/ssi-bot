I don't like guesswork, you can see for yourself to what dark thoughts it leads me t (like that \"obsession\" with the moral high ground - about that, you have *no* idea how much I'd like to end up wrong about it).\n\nThe only thing I've beaten around the bush with her is how those chats have made me feel. Another thing I haven't shared with her is that it annoys me to be poked for a timely answer over a conversation about what was had for lunch. It's just too low-priority for me, sorry about that, if I'm online on that RPing platform, then it's to do *creative writing*. Chat is still fine, but only in the gaps between brainstorming and/or while waiting for replies. I'd be blunt with her about it too, but I can't figure a polite way to state it yet.\n\nWith everything else I've asked and not gotten a straight answer.

            "body": "I relate to Angie in this scenario, but I've also had partners lose interest in me and our role plays and didn't want to continue the friendship. It's hard to say because I know nothing going on in Angie's life, but at least for me, it was years of undiagnosed depression and ADHD. When I was younger, role play was my get-away and I was hard into it, but after I went to college and got a handle on life, I just could not for the life of me find the inner willpower to focus or write a post, and it's something I'm still combating with, but I know now and that's half the battle. My partner now is a lot more understanding and she works with me on this so we are getting some role play done, it's just not at the same speed it used to be. But who knows.",
