            "body": "I'm one of those people who enjoys plotting out a general series of events or scenes. I don't mesh well with people who like to improvise or \"wing it\" as some would say. However there are folks out there so who prefer a more casual approach and expect things to happen on their own and drag their heels into the ground when pushed to plan even a little. I would say the guy sounded like he wanted instant gratification. I've had some folks have their character fall for mine within the first ten posts between us. It was weird and I ditched that RP when it was obvious we had different ideas of how much time we'd like to put into the story. Sounds like a really strange encounter though and it's good you didn't sink too much time and effort into it before you realized it wasn't getting off the ground.\n\nI find if I can't brainstorm with someone and feel like we're around the same page, I tend to cut my losses early on. People who I have to push to communicate interests and ideas, are ones I don't see myself vibing with. Now that I'm much older than when I started RPing, I've figured out that the first several exchanges of ideas are a good way to measure if we're a sustainable pair. First impressions for me count and if my potential partner is unable to discuss characters and plot then I how am I to assume they can suddenly shine during their actual roleplaying?\n\nHope you found someone better though, OP.

Communication skills, or rather, the lack thereof put aside, they really did seem to want me to just start off with doing something not only illogical\u2014 but also very out of character for my characters, and there was no other option but to do as they wanted me to or it was a no go. Certainly am glad I didn't wind up actually wasting more time on it than I did, that's for sure!    \n\n\nAnd I wholeheartedly agree, gotta be able to vibe else it's just not gonna work. No matter how good of a writer someone may be, dropping awesome posts, if they are unpleasant to deal with OOC it just doesn't work in the long\u2014 or short run, since RPing is basically all about team-work. You are writing a story together, after all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had some partners I've had amazing writing chemistry with, but their inability to communicate properly caused for more problems than it was worth, eventually. It is odd, though, to be so attuned when writing with one another, but not outside of the RP.  Always confuses me how someone can be so emphatic, considerate, and good at communicating in character, but out of character... it just isn't there. I guess some pressure of reality or something? No clue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, I digress. Thank you for your input and kind words!",
