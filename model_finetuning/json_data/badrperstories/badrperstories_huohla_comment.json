So my reaction was to have her pass out and be severely injured. The other player asked why and I was like, you literally bashed her skull with a solid piece of metal, the hell did you think she was gonna do?? Stand up??\n\nEven if your character can shrug off pain (a lot of people can in real life) at least describe it.",

It is still sad to me, because they are a phenomenal writer and build the best world's, but it is so frustrating having a fallible character that can take hits and feel pain, only to be met with characters that can dodge and laugh off blows. To make matters worse, almost every other post seems to have an internal monologue of how foolish or inneffectual my characters are. It was really insulting.",
