            "body": "The way you described the disaster of the secret furry that is rose, just fucking killed me. I am sorry for your suffering, but my God was that entertaining to read. \n\nIn return here's one of mine.\n\nI had this partner who wanted to play out her kinks, I was just coming out of a full on RP desert and she wasn't getting any bites from what I could tell soni figured screw it I'll at least check out her prompts. They all involved her petite human character getting destroyed by orcs some in less than consensual ways. By this point I had unsuccessfully applied to 12 people over the course of a week so I went with the one I figured I would least least trigger my gag reflex, so I could at least get writing again. \n\nShe has all of zero input on the world, the only thing she decided on was the kink and nothing else, so it would fall entirely to me to build my character, the entire world around it, and all supporting characters. Fine at least I'll get to make a lot of characters, which is admittedly one of my favorite things to do.\n\nI spent roughly a week building this world, all these members of the tribe, and my character with backstory to tie them together. We write for roughly one day, three or four times back and forth and I had to call it quits. The offending post needs a touch of back story first. The tribe is in a stronghold built out in arid plains, mine in the center. I know, not particularly inventive for orcs, but in a weeks time I wasn't giving it much thought.\n\nHer post is all about a super awkward interaction between our characters, how she's unable to speak a sentence without blushing and tripping over her words, then when one of the supporting characters makes fun of her, she runs off crying to the GIANT LUSH GRASS AROUND THE LAKE COMPLETE WITH WATERFALL. Are you fucking kidding me? Arid fucking plains, you're lucky to have a damned well in this flat desolate location, and you invent a waterfall lake in the world you wanted nothing to do with creating.  Fucking retconned my entire world creating a pity party.",

            "body": "Ugh... I can relate, somewhat. I run a group role-play, and some people just don\u2019t know how to read. They come in, read the bare minimum. \n\nAnd then they **ask** when all of the information they\u2019re asking for is freshly available to them. I spent hours building this world, and hours compiling the information in easily readable, clean docs. \n\nI think one of my worst made a robot/android character in Victorian Era 1800s, something that could not feel, in a role-play that was primarily motivated by character connections. The reason for this is because everything in this world is, yes, overpowered, but this person created multiple characters and had multiple ideas- the only issue, all of them were a bit TOO unique. Like, to the point where it was fucking awful. Main character vibes. They couldn\u2019t stand to be one of the races, they didn\u2019t want to use magic, they wanted to be a human and somehow get powers without the sacrifices required- it\u2019s a dark fantasy in which we draw the power of our magic from the lives of other dimensions. They said they had problems with being evil, and then they said they had issues with other characters being morally ambiguous and I told them that they could make something out of that- to make their character based on those feelings of \u201cusing magic to stop people from using magic-\u201c a necessary evil. They claimed that they had issues with making an evil OC, even if they do ONE thing evil, and yet their original robot OC was a mass murderer that had their will removed entirely. We parted after everyone got tired of the constant arguments this person initiated. Because her character was a robot, she couldn\u2019t think to get out of the situation given to her... and, well. RIP. \n\nA second one was the one girl who wanted her characters her way with no changes whatsoever even though they conflicted with the Universe\u2019s rules because it was already a pre-created character. Her entitlement led her to argue. I just asked her to create a fresh character for the role-play as hers didn\u2019t fit and she claimed that we were mocking her because we didn\u2019t accept her ideas as reality. I told her she was being awful and pretty much dismissed her. \n\nMost recent issue was with these two, they\u2019re young so it\u2019s kind of a mix, but they wanted a high rank in politics without having the characters for them. One just completely role-played an \u201cUWU shy anxious girl\u201d when her personality actually claimed she was rather confident, making her... a poor general. To explain,  the organization she was a part of were full of humans, while others had creatures as their main make-up so this organization has to be more diligent in how they act lest it ends up feasted upon by others. They need to think about how they act, otherwise they can start a war that they\u2019re not sure they\u2019d be able to win. Both she and her friend wanted to be Generals- even though in this world you don\u2019t need to have heavy political power to be strong- and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer despite the fact the narrative would have been harmed with the way she was acting. A soft, anxious general? I don\u2019t mind that if written right, in a unique way, but her bio had NOTHING about her being soft and anxious and it just came off as how she acted OOC. I HATE self-inserts, I\u2019m not gonna lie, so maybe I\u2019m a bit biased. But I told them they\u2019d be better at a lower rank and they bounced. \n\nIn the end, role-play is still going strong but the level of entitled people thinking I HAVE to DM a scene or role-play with them just because they make a character drives me insane. It\u2019s my time. You waste my time by not adhering to the rules or reading. And you know what that is? That is rude. That is self-centred. Make a good character that belongs where it is with all of the advice given to you, or take no when you hear it. \n\nSorry for the rant, I just spend so much time on this role-playing and devote a lot of my time to making things fun and running events.
