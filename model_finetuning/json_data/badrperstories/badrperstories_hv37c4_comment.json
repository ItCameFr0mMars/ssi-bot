I've had some real wierdo fucko's follow me onto my social media (even after I expressly told them this wasn't okay) and start stirring shit up just to get attention. \n\nLike, if I'm talking to some of my friends about my completely tame SFW hobbies, don't barge into the conversation unprompted, replying to everyone in the thread, about your fetish shit that nobody asked to hear. That just earns you an immediate block, no exceptions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome advice for you going forward, as someone who knows what you're going through.\n\nImgur is your friend. \n\nYou can upload posts and have them be unlisted, as well as organising them into albums (though this has gotten harder since their tacky redesign). \n\nYou can copy a URL to the image directly and share that, that way you can share a link to a reference photo or artwork without giving them direct access to any of your pages. Sure, they might reverse-image search it, but having even a single layer of compartmentalisation between internet strangers and your home turf is super helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut don't feel any remorse over how you handled this. Roleplay is escapism, simple as that. A way to occasionally put the worries and stresses of day to day life behind you. But for some, as is obvious with this guy? It is their life, there's no start and end point. \n\nI've seen people just directionlessly let this distraction become their entire existence, which is why they so obnoxiously hound people like this. They cross boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, because in their view, there isn't a boundary, it's all just a way of getting what they want. So cutting ties before things got going was the smart move. It wouldn't have gotten better, believe me.",
