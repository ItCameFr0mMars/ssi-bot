Neat, organized, broken up with pics or sectioned off cleanly, can make 2000 words of well written lore and history feel like two paragraphs.\n\nYou're right, the quality is incredibly important, but the look of something is also important and can make it more immersing. If you had someone offering to help, I'd have taken it, especially if you had them report to you about where things would go. It'd take the stress of making things pretty off of you and you can focus on what YOU love which is good writing and world building. It'd help attract more people for sure rather than large blocks of text and scattered pictures if you had any.",
