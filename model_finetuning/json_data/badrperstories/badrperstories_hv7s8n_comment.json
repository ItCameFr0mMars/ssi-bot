            "body": "I do understand how being ghosted repeatedly can leave some paranoia. It can be a really frustrating experience, especially if it seems to come out of nowhere. And it makes it difficult to really get excited about a line or scene, because unless you've established a good history with your partner, you're never really sure when someone will up and disappear.\n\nBut as someone who works from home (and has for a long time), just because I'm online all the time doesn't mean I'm always available to talk. Even when I'm not working, the fact that I'm online doesn't mean I'm available. I could be playing a game or watching a movie or I may have completely wandered away to cook dinner. \n\nI don't think that makes it wrong - or even an *inconvenience to me personally* \\- if someone messages me while I'm doing something else. It's what comes after, the conflict or attitude that arises because someone felt entitled to my immediate answer and didn't get it, that makes me uncomfortable. If the person is able to wait patiently, there's really no problem.\n\nIn your case, it seems like you saw they were playing a game so you knew they were otherwise preoccupied, but you sent a message anyway. As long as you didn't keep poking them for a response to the question while they were playing, I see no harm. Definitely not one worthy of a 2 day silent treatment.\n\nBut if someone kept asking me or took it as a personal insult that I didn't give them what they wanted, when they wanted, regardless of what I was doing (or not doing), I'd consider it a huge red flag, and it would likely make me less interested in playing with them.",
