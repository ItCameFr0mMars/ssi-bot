However, it is incredibly rude, hurtful and can cause a lot of issues to ghost someone. I have been harassed by partners before. I've been stalked on social, had people message my dad, etc and it sucks. I *get* it. But people who ghost for no reason just suck. Not everyone is going to go buttfuck crazy if you choose to end the RP. Just be polite, say \"Sorry, this isn't working\" then leave. It's far more frustrating to be waiting on tenderhooks for someone to reply then find they've unfriended you and left the server than to just be told they're not interested anymore, so you can have chance to find a new partner if need be.",

I still have the hysterical, clingy emails. It fucking sucked, dude.\n\nBack when I had first started RPing when I was 16 or so, I got way involved with people who would treat me like shit, because of this hobby which was supposed to have fun. I\u2019d start to dread when certain people got online and I\u2019d been busy with schoolwork and hadn\u2019t posted, because then they\u2019d start yelling at me about it. \n\nI learned after a few particularly harrowing experiences that I didn\u2019t want to deal with that shit any more. So if someone really irks me, sometimes I\u2019ll just block them on all platforms and peace out.\n\nOther times, the conversation just kind of fizzles, replies stop coming as quickly, and things just die.\n\nI don\u2019t consider that ghosting. Most of my role plays, I can take or leave. The scant few I\u2019m really attached to, I\u2019ll try to contact them. I\u2019ve had limited success.\n\nSometimes I just stop replying for a bit. Stuff gets busy. It gets past the point where I should have replied, but didn\u2019t. And since I never hear from the partner in question asking where I\u2019ve been, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter so very much that I\u2019ve disappeared. *C\u2019est la vie*.\n\nI dunno, if you\u2019re inclined to take it personally, here\u2019s a warning not to play with me in particular, I guess.",

            "body": "I'd like to add another point to this, from personal experience:\n\nIf your RP partner asks you \"did you see my last reply,\" just tell them yes or no. Unless they asked several times or within a few hours of making their reply, there's a very good chance that they're NOT trying to guilt trip you or rush you into replying. Nowhere in the sentence \"did you see my last reply\" are they saying that they want you to hurry up or that they're upset about you not replying yet; all they're doing is asking a simple question to verify that you know it's your turn. \n\nAs I said, it's one thing if they ask several times or very soon after making their reply, but if they just ask once after a decent amount of time it's a perfectly reasonable question.",

            "body": "I've ghosted and been ghosted. Sometimes it's life, sometimes it's just awkward. A lot of the rps I end up ghosting have a few similarities.\n\n1) There is a lack of subplots, or even a lack of a plot besides a romantic/sexual relationship, and I've likely offered some and asked the other person multiple times by then what else we can add so I stop getting stuck. In these cases, I really don't want to have that awkward conversation where they try to make it more interesting because I want to leave but then it is a very small effort that doesn't end up giving me what I need. This leads me to my next point.\n\n2) I am too nice to say no, and have trouble admitting defeat when it comes to a dead rp. I work really, *really* hard to keep my rps fresh and interesting; I don't want to just abandon them after all that hard work, so I try to *make* myself write. But then a day passes, and I don't know what to write. And then another, and another. Before I know it, it's been a long while and I've pretty much ghosted. Sometimes they will ask if I'm ok, sometimes not. I will usually answer truthfully if they ask, but if not... then they probably didn't care enough about the rp to begin with, anyways. Otherwise, I've been trying to be more clear when I need help, but sometimes that falls on the back burner to my other rps.\n\n3) Life. I work 44 hours per week. I am currently moving into my first house in two months. I still have to plan my wedding, which was supposed to be this fall but now has to be replanned, obviously. I have a fianc\u00e9 to spend time with, and two cats to look after. I have chores to do at the apartment. *I need time to do other things.* Just to relax away from the rps for a day or so. I try to be open with my activity level if I'm planning on doing things, but I don't always know what is going to happen. I also feel guilty for asking for a break, or I worry they'll leave and/or get uninterested in my time away. So sometimes I just leave randomly and reappear a week or so later, depending on what is going on. I really do try to communicate, but I don't always succeed.\n\nWhen I started using reddit to find rp partners, I'd wonder myself why people disappear and/or not reply much, but now through my experiences I know that everyone else has a life too. They need time off, they get bored, they have things to do. This is why I often encourage them to talk to me even when we're not in rping moods, and honestly that has kept so many rps going that otherwise might not have. If there's any advice I can leave for you, it is to make friends with the other person ooc if you can, and to make it very clear that you would like to know if they need more from the rp or get bored.",

            "body": "It's not that simple and I'll give you a little story why I think so.\n\nA long while ago I did a chat-based RP. It went on for a few hours of exchanging fairly detailed posts back and forth, until it got late for me and I said I'd be going to sleep. Before taking off, I asked what I still think is a courtesy question: \"Do you like what we have? 'Cause I sure do.\" Imagine my surprise when the answer was no. They didn't like it, at all.\n\nIt was very strange to me back then why someone would force themselves to reply to a RP they *don't like* and *consistently so*, without voicing their concerns until the end, (though I think I understand it better now) so... baffled, I asked why! And the reasons were given: me posting slowly; lots of my descriptions were fluff in their opinion; and also some of my word choices in those descriptions were severely disliked. Something along the lines of: \"There was a X on the table, *undoubtedly* meaning Y.\" (Later I discovered more reasons that weren't mentioned, but hindsight is 20/20.)\n\nAnd what did I do to respond? I got into defensive mode (sleep was out of the question by that point). I looked at the time stamps, pointed out my posts took roughly the same time as theirs, then I went the route of \"Well by your logic, why did you describe this and that, then\". Things later devolved to even more pointing of fingers and nothing constructive, in the end we blocked each other and that was it. My mood ruined, and I'm sure I ruined theirs as well. Lose-lose.\n\nThe bottom line is, it went far beyond than just a single line to end it with. I think the longer the RP gets, the more biased the declined side becomes and the more important it is to them to learn 'why' and get closure... and it takes a *lot* of maturity, I think, to take it in stride and keep the ego from getting involved. I made that mistake and it turned into a pointless \"You're wrong and I'm right\" argument.\n\nI'm absolutely *not* saying you'd do such a thing - just that others would.",
