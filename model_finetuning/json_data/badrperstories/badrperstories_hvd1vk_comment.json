It's not like she was just laughing and stuff.\n\nAs for \"the actual exchange\" is uncertain in many ways as I was there when this flirting happened but the factors are just those apparently, as:\n\n1. He didn't send ANYTHING to her, in DMs. He sent me screenshots of their chat being empty while she denied me to see her chat. (suspicious if you ask me)\n2. She pretty much reported that she felt endangered whenever he was in VC or online now due to how he \"took advantage\" of her being drunk.\n\nAgain I am not defending this dude. I am saying she's just as much as fault as he is. I don't know if she woke up and then regret the earlier night or literally wanted to cancel this dude. This, we may never know.

I'm sorry you lost your position in this group, but I kind of feel like you're imputing blame on the proposed victim without having evidence either way. \n\nDo you know what was said that made her feel threatened? Because there is a big difference between gentle flirting and any myriad of other things that could be said. For one thing, suggesting to take it off line. I'm just conjecturing because the bottom line is, we don't know enough! \n\nAnd given our current culture of denying sexual assault and harassment, I can see why your fellow mods erred on the side of caution. It is important that people feel safe in roleplay communities, because it is a manner of exposing ourself. I'm not telling you what to do. You can dislike this woman for what happened, I just don't think there are enough facts to go on. And another thing, if I were approached by some low level mod to show my DM history, I might be more than a little hesitant.
