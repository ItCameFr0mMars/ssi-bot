The bigger the group, the longer the wait and the higher chance you have of people losing interest.\n\nTo get around posting orders, when I GMed, I would have a lax posting order where everyone had to post once but in any order. So if I posted, I'd wait for the other players to post when they could before I'd post again. It ensured no one felt left behind and if someone did miss a 2 rounds in a row, they'd be cut and we'd move on.\n\nGroup RPs are tricky to get off the ground and keep moving so I commend people who stick with it. You're relying on the cooperation of others and people can be quick difficult haha. As a former GM, I think you're doing your best but if you gotta put your foot down and skip some folks, put your foot down. Don't lost momentum because of other people but at the same time, I've found breaking a large group into two smaller ones, also makes things easier to manage if people don't have time to post as often as they once intended.",

I could probably make a mathematic formula for it if I really wanted to waste my time, but it does seem like the amount of people added to an RP is inversely proportional to how enjoyable it\u2019s actually gonna be. \n\nMy suggestion for you is to find a good RP partner to do 1v1s with, who can match your pace a little better. One good partner is worth a dozen mediocre ones, IMO.",
