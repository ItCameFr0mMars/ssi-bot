Brilliant retort on your character's part.\n\nI think also, though that this would be a good time to send an OOC note letting the guy know you don't want any kind of relationship RP including kissing and things like that. Friendships are as far as you're willing to go, and you could remind him that it's partly because you are under age.\n\nBUT.... it IS weird that he, as a 21 year old, had his character make out with yours when he knew you were 16. So if you are getting bad vibes and think he might try again or try to dance around your boundaries, then it may be better to tell him you don't think you two are a good fit for roleplay after all and just wish him well. Follow your instinct. If you feel wary, then there is nothing wrong with moving on from this guy.",

Going forward I might suggest only working with people a little closer to your age. Stay away from 18+ folks, people can get crazy ideas about how close you are because you roleplay. And it is something I just try to avoid with minors altogether. I have more perspective now that lots of people were trying to get more than roleplay out of me.

I too have been rping from a young age and had my fair share of creepers. Unfortunately, some individuals see RP as a consequence-free platform to interact with under-age people, citing that it's only words as to why it's \"okay\" to act predatory and creepy. Sometimes they might try to pressure you into agreeing that something is okay with backwards logic that never really feels right (trust your gut). Sometimes they might try to befriend you by showering you with praise and affection to make you feel good and like you're close friends. Sometimes they might try to take that affection away and replace it with anger to pressure you into things.\n\nIf you encounter any of those cases, just remember: You hold more power over yourself and your RP than anyone else! :D You've got the keys and can kick anyone to the curb who scares you, makes you uncomfortable, or who is a royal pain in the butt! It's all about the fun and creativity, so never feel bad about clearly telling your partners your boundaries, and sticking to them.\n\n(I would also avoid 18+ RPers until you hit that age as well just to be safe :) )",

            "body": "XD He can kiss your fist goodbye instead! Good call!\n\n\nCore rule of mine: Ya can rarely ever go too far when retaliating someone for their outlandish behavior. I\u2019m (18F) very much an SFW-RP\u2019er myself, so any kissy-kissy stuff that isn\u2019t remotely relevant, set up, or not remotely wanted by the User who did not ask for a move... gets the electrified bat.\n\n\nLemme tell ya a brief story about some dude I\u2019ll call Todd (17M, then 16M), who thought his OC who was also called Todd(16M) had the ability to face-suck any girls he kissed to stop being angry or upset about another User OC nearly shooting her in the face with a S&amp;W\\^\\^.\n\n\nMy OC called Yorien (16F) had kinda just wandered into a hall where Users could enter their new OCs into the world. There was something going on, namely a spooky shadow resting on a windowsill, creepily looking at the new arrivals.\n\n\nA small group of User OCs, including one from my friend who I\u2019ll call (OOC) Mika (???F but prolly old enough to carry a gun), were discussing what to do about it. And I joined in Yorien to see if I could help.\n\n\nThough, the User who actually controlled the shadow thing was offline for a while thanks to timezones. So everyone kept discussing on how to handle this shadow but couldn\u2019t actually make attacks because the shadow basically temporarily did not exist.\n\n\nThen enter Todd... on like three talkative dinosaur things from a game, riding them like a cowboy.\n\n\n\u2022-\u2022 ... ohok.\n\n\nI tried making Yorien leave in her usual bratty style, as the chat was getting thoroughly cluttered with heated OC arguing and there were just too many damn Users in one room.\n\n\n**[POW]**\n\n\nMika: \u201cHey! Where do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d\n\n\nMika shot barely next to Yorien\u2019s head in an attempted display of skill, bullet tearing open the doorframe.\n\n\nYori: ... *\u201dWhat the actual f\u20acck?!\u201d*\n\n\nShe was not very keen on having lead fly around her head though, and went back to verbally give it to her. Comedically being two heads shorter than Mika, she unequipped her backpack and used it as a footstool to basically say\u2014\n\n\nYori: *\u201dDON\u2019T. EVER. DO THAT AGAIN.\u201d*\n\n\n... but then, OOC Todd PM\u2019ed me.\n\n\nHe said he was gonna \u201ctry something risky\u201d. And that he put a lotta effort into it as to try and make it happen according to plan. He couldn\u2019t exactly tell what but he said his OC would not be breaking any RP rules.\n\n\nMe being a somewhat dense Cura at the time, I went like \u201csure, don\u2019t gotta ask if ya got something interesting to spice up the RP. Gotta encourage others.\u201d\n\n\n... boy was I wrong.\n\n\n**ACTUAL STUFF THEY TYPED:**\n\n\n*Sighing, [Todd] did something he knew was a massive gamble. Deducing this was actually somewhat of a serious situation, he walked up to Yorien whilst her attention was on something else. Once he was close enough he grabbed her by the shoulder and forced her to turn and look at him, before grasping her by the cheeks and diving in. He kissed her on the lips. No hesitation. His time with people told him that people react to sudden and unexpected things with shock which forces them into a state of realization to grasp situations. A sort of psychological pause that forces them to figure out what happened. He was tossing a coin and banking on the fact Yorien was just that, a regular human. He held the kiss for a solid 10 seconds before letting her go and stepping away, prepared to react to any acts of aggression if his coin toss failed. He then raised an eyebrow, and asked:*\n\n\n*\u201dWe're trying to help. Will you let us? We're just trying to understand.\"*\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nO-O May I present to thee, some OOC comments following that one text from other Users:\n\n\nUser: ((Nani?!))\n\n\nMika: ((as rex turns around he can see the barrel of 50 caliber magnum. \"That is sexual harassment\u2014\u201c\n\nMika: ((EXACTLY\n\n\nUser: (([oh oh](https://m.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=tzJ8zWlSJl8&amp;autoplay=1)\n\n\nMika: ((i am... Speechless\n\n\nMika: ((WHAT THE F\\*\\*K JUST HAPPENED\n\n\nMika: ((\\*faints\\*\n\n\nTodd who explains his master plan: ([Todd] is trying to take advantage of the shock one feels when they're surprised so he's trying to see if she\u2019ll register what's going on by showing a fake romantic action)\n\n\n\u00d2\\^\u00d3... **EX-FRICKEN-SCUSE ME SIR?!**\n\n\nPast-Me who is very pissed off herself rn: *... Yorien, still holding her Ace Bat, a simple aluminium bat that was upgraded by the supernova-causing Hand of Omega, creates an electric and magical charge whilst Yorien\u2019s in that 10-second long period of asking herself who the heck this a$$hole is...*\n\n\n**[BASH]**\n\n\n*... and makes a swing for his two lower baseballs in an attempt to score one heck of a tazer homerun.*\n\n\n\u2022w\u2022... that\u2019ll teach him.\n\n\nIt was a legal hit, in a timeframe where Todd was too busy sucking face to notice the pain of a thousand stars approaching over the horizon, in a place he could DEFINITELY NOT ignore.\n\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t\\^\\^. Fell to the ground like a wimp due to a girl that\u2019s three heads shorter than them catching their precious score coin in the air and ramming it where it hurts the most.",

Even if you yourself, aged your characters a into child/teen to explore what that character was like during those ages, I honestly can't reasonably find a problem with that. The problem starts to arise when you age those characters down only so that they can participate in NSFW roleplay, because that's just  pedophilic. And of course, people will try to argue that it's \"just roleplay\" or \"it's not actually a child\" so it's bad, but if it's not that bad, then why is it considered CP in Canada?",
