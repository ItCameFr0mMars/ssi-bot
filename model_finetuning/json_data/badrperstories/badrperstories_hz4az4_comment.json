            "body": "So even though I've written out my (very basic) suggestions below, I'd like to know what you think your \"problem areas\" are in your RP style. You say you're semi-lit. What do you think it would take to consider yourself lit/advanced?\n\nMy first suggestion would be to ***read***. Read novels, read short stories, read fanfic or anything else that really appeals to you. Try to figure out what it is about the author's writing that engages you and appeals to you, and try to emulate those techniques. Don't copy, of course, but use it to analyze what you'd like to see improve in your own writing.\n\nMy second suggestion would be to ***write***. Take a character you've previously created, create a new one, or use a canon character from some fandom you enjoy. Write a scene with them on your own and focus on adding in details and other characters that really bring the setting and the action to life. Be vivid. Picture it in your mind like it's a movie you're watching, and describe it in such a way that if someone were to read it, they would be able to envision it the same way you see it playing out in your head. Do drabbles (being a literate writer doesn't always mean writing the lengthiest posts - you have to know when brevity is best), writing sprints, or even just sit down and write out something you saw over the course of your day. Again, use your words to paint the picture. My favorite RPs have always been the ones that feel the most immersive to me.\n\nThird, **don't be too hard on yourself**. It takes time. Some of the stuff you write will seem awkward or rough when you read back over it. That's fine. Tweak it after. I still read through all my replies before sending them. Even then, I'm guilty of re-reading them after posting, and wishing I'd written things a different way, used a different phrase, not repeated a certain word so many times. Find roleplay partners you consider \"lit/advanced\" and, if their prompts appeal to you, message them to see if they'd be willing to play with you. Be upfront about the fact that you think you're semi-lit and you're working on getting better/honing your writing skills. Sure, not everyone will say yes, but some might. \n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "In what regards do you feel you need improvement?\n\nGetting \u2018good\u2019 at RP is generally something that only comes with practice, although you can skip the practicing angle if you\u2019ve spent a lot of time solo writing and can carry a story on your own. But from what you\u2019ve said here, it looks like you haven\u2019t done that.\n\nIf you have not done that, start. Read other people\u2019s work, and read varying things (important), and pay attention to what you do and do not like about the way that they write, the stories that they tell, and the characters they have. Do that again. And again. And again. In between the reading, do some writing incorporating the ideas you\u2019ve sourced from the media you have consumed. Push yourself. Try to figure out a way to describe something. A lot of people at this point may tell you to rely on a thesaurus. Don\u2019t do that. \n\nRead Stephen King\u2019s \u2018On Writing\u2019, also. I can\u2019t describe exactly how it will help you, only that it will.",
