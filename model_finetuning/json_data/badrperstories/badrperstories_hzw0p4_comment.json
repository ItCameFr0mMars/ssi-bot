            "body": "Your set up seemed reasonable to me, especially if there is more than just you and her in the rp. And your counter idea seems reasonable as well. Especially with the clause of if they needed more time due to a real life thing, that is would be granted. And honestly, 7 is basically as week. So if people can\u2019t respond within a week in a group rp like that, then yeah, maybe it wasn\u2019t the right fit for her. To me she sounded flakey. \n\nI don\u2019t rp in groups any more specifically for reasons of having to wait for responses. I like the faster flow of 1x1. And for me usually, if I have no response for over two weeks, I either leave the rp (if I didn\u2019t create the server), or I delete the server. This is if there has been no communication for over two weeks either in the rp or OOC. I currently have one story that is in limbo because my partner in it is having some real life stuff going on, which he said he was in OOC, so I told him to take the time he needed. He checked in again the other day to say he has forgotten, and it seemed like things were going to be clearing up soon and asked me to please wait. Our story is or was going smoothly and good up til then, so I told him I was more than willing to stick around. Now I have had to leave and close out several servers already though. One person I over looked, and realized it had been a month since contact. I double checked that they were not waiting for me, which they were not, then I closed it out.\n\nIt\u2019s only fair to the others in your group for the counters. And to me it seems like you we\u2019re doing your best to be fair to everyone. Maybe this LDA might have had other stories and what not going on elsewhere and just spread herself too thin, dunno. But either way, you were more than accommodating in my opinion.",
