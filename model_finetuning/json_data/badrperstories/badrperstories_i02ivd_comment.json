I only saw one ping in the entirety of the message, that\u2019s my bad then! Yeah, trash partner. It\u2019s hard to find good ones unless you\u2019re invited to a group of people who stick together to avoid bad etiquette, but it seems to be easier to find good ones in a group. One on ones have become meh to me, a little bit of a longer wait time.\n\nEdit: whoops, didn\u2019t hit the right button, reply to your reply.",
