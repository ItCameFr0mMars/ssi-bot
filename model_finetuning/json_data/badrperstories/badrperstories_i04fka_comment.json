Which is kind of a trend I\u2019ve observed with RPers in general. People very rarely want to play the guy in a het relationship, from what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nSo that, plus a group setting (man I\u2019ve never had a good time in a group RP) made it a recipe for disaster.\n\nHonestly if you want a GoT roleplay, I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have trouble finding a good 1x1 partner? It still seems fairly popular. That might be your best bet.",

But we do group stories together. \n\nIn those stories, yeah everyone wanted to play a pretty girl to be courted. Since it's based on more medieval tropes, women aren't as autonomous. When I tried branching out to focus my Gargalen on making trade alliances, she'd get stopped at every turn, because a woman without a man is useless. \n\nIt had one positive though. That last story was the last straw for me. I just make my own story almost immediately after, and we've been running for two and a half years now.

I, conversely, have never had a good time in one on one RP.\n\nLol, I'm gonna just... Completely reassess my original thoughts on your topic. With the way that you responded to my initial *advice* and expected me to *know you personally from your username and stalk your previous posts on this subreddit*, I get the impression that there's a *reason* that you have RP drama and partners, even ones you were originally getting on with well, go to such extreme measures to avoid playing with you.\n\nSo. Since you want me to go back and look through all your posts on this forum, I've done that. Not just 'both stories' you mention, but your posts of the last few months. And, now that I'm reading them with the lens of knowing that they're all written from the same person, I'm just gonna go ahead and venture a guess that the biggest contributing factor for your RP trouble seems to be *you*.\n\nYou seem overly defensive about a hobby that really should be for fun, and [take well-meaning criticism as a personal attack to which you feel compelled to respond to snarkily](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i04fka/why_i_wont_write_in_got_stories_anymore/fzpkfxe/). You constantly join servers with established groups, but oh! it's actually *all these other server players and admins who are* [terrible](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i04fka/why_i_wont_write_in_got_stories_anymore/)*,* [overbearing](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/hv1mwp/my_worst_rp_experience_of_all_time/) *people.* No one writes enough to match your length, because [you're a novella writer](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/ht8ftp/when_you_join_can_you_please_actually_join/) and all these dumb kids who \\~haven't been RPing as long as you, [lolol look how ignorant they are!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/fj5gyt/lil_beb_role_players_thinking_rp_is_only_for_kids/)\\~ in the groups you join are just semi-lit scrubs. You post so fast and don't like to wait your turn when it comes to post orders because everyone else is just [oh so slow](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/hwq0zn/heres_my_issue_with_post_orders/), except for if you don't like the RP, in which case you [slow down a bunch to discourage your partner from replying](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/h13b7u/a_case_in_favour_of_ghosting/). If[ people aren't in the mood to play with you right then and there, it's bad and they're personally trying to hurt you, if people try to include you in their scenes so you don't sit there making constant solo posts and aren't being ignored, they're 'rubbing it in your face'](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i04fka/why_i_wont_write_in_got_stories_anymore/), everyone else's [characters are shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/g08rjd/potentially_unpopular_opinion_admins_should/) and yours are [so well-rounded and cool](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i04fka/why_i_wont_write_in_got_stories_anymore/fzpkfxe/), etc etc etc.\n\nThere we go. I read through your posts, and that's my abridged summary of how you, someone who seems to have *chronic drama in every server they join and who then goes off on someone trying to give them advice on the BadRPerStories subreddit,* come across to an outside observer. You seem like an elitist and in addition to that, you don't seem like a very nice person to speak with just in general, and I know that if you came with that attitude on a server in which I was playing, or even just chatting casually, I'd remove my own characters from active play just to avoid having to interact with you, too.\n\nBut you know what? In looking for your posts in this subreddit, I also found all your other posts, and it looks like you're going through some serious shit lately. I wish you well in that regard, but I do hope that once you get through it, you can stop being so abrasive to other people who initially approach you just trying to help. :/",
