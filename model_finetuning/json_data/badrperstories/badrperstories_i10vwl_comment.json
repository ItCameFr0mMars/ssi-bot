So they say they'd never ghost you to make it more likely you won't.  But, whenever they ghost, it's totally justified in their heads.  That is my theory.",

            "body": "&gt;Why is it always people who accuse of ghosting or say \"I won't ghost, I promise!\" that wind up ghosting?\n\nIf I had to wager a guess:\n\na) They don't like being ghosted and want to assure a lack of it hence the upfront disclaimer.  Ghosting hurts them but doesn't necessarily create empathy for the other side when they do it - it doesn't occur to them that people can be doing it for the same reasons they are so they cognitive dissonance so hard they don't realize they're doing what qualifies as ghosting or try to pretend \"well i had a good reason to ghost not like the other ghosters\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) they're really, really bad at identifying their own emotions and behaviour.  I've been guilty of this one, ghosting majorly fucks with me because of RSD *but* I also come from a background where bladibla tragic backstory people wouldn't let me say no and would scold me if I said it 'the wrong way' without bothering to teach an 'acceptable' way of saying no.  So I'd not want to do something but not recognize that emotion and suppress like a motherfucker because \"well, it would be rude/mean to say no especially if they're a friend\".  I'd feel trapped and awkwardly fade off subconsciously because I didn't know what to say/do let alone how to admit 'okay maybe im not into this and shouldnt just rp through an entire scene out of \"politeness\" '.I'm guessing your ghoster ran into an issue of that, \"man im not feeling this but ofukc i said i wouldn't leave uhhhh /avoids logging in Nailed It\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) I find another issue is Rpers knowing how/feeling justified in saying no to someone who's low quality or an ass but if they're a good Rper/person and it just doesn't mesh then they run into a weird hang-up about \"but I don't have a good enough reason to say no\".  We associate bad rper = bad person where it's not warranted eg dorky low-quality stuff and we're afraid of making someone feel that to be the case.  So since we don't want to be 'mean' we get avoidant of the problem and don't confront it (which is the huge crux of ghosting behaviour).  We hinge a lot of our worth on Rp quality etc and that normally bites people in the ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) There can be a 'hmm' about a topical fixation when nothing in particular brought it up, eg \"man im sick of drama\" being a red flag for Rp applications for \"this person is gonna cause a shitton of drama\".  Bit like \"don't talk about your ex on the first date\" I guess.  I'm guessing \"I won't ghost I swears\" is a new version of that - they don't want you to leave if they're having fun but if they aren't having fun they're just not really going to exercise that empathy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) depending on the platform if it's shit like f-list (erp hellsite) a lot of people pull a \"but why?\" when you say no, which yeah do not do this, let the person peace out without making them feel they have to justify their choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen a few posters go \"oh ghosting isn't a big deal just another way of saying no rite also if you're getting ghosted a lot it must be something you did\" and honestly, as somebody who's done it without thinking it isn't.  I had issues I wasn't dealing with which was why I just wasn't saying no, I also felt fucked up by being ghosted because being ignored when I didn't have what someone wanted set me up to ignore my own wants and needs further to try and neurotically avoid a mini abandonment segment.  Tied further into \"if you don't have what this person wants they won't even talk to you anymore they'll quietly discard\".  It also meant time spend trying to suss out \"are they ghosting or just afk for a while?\" which for my autistic ass was implausible and fed into anxiety where I felt people were bailing on me when they were really just busy but online a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**bladibla obvious disclaimer** if you suspect someone will turn into a psycho hosebeast if you say no directly then listen to your gut, your safety is more paramount.  I had some dude block evade fifty kabillion times pretending to be other people and I stand by going \"dude screw off\" if just because I can show screencaps to warn others but yeah shit's exhausting.\n\n[https://springhole.net/writing/how-to-quit-an-rp-without-ghosting.htm](https://springhole.net/writing/how-to-quit-an-rp-without-ghosting.htm) also this article is nice",
