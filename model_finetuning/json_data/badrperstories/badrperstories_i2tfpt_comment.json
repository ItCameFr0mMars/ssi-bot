Not really a reason to laugh, but definitely something that can impact the roleplaying experience negatively. (Also, not really that weird considering he is a minor, a lot of people in that age group aren't the best writers).\n\nAnd he invented a monster for the backstory of his character and apparently...that is bad for some reason? Sorry, I guess that I am missing something. Was it not fitting for the setting and therefore super weird? Like, I get this is something that could make this character overpowered or annoying in the actual rp if he does not write him properly, but I would suggest that you would an example of it backfiring, because at the moment I don't really get what was so bad about it. Or why he could not be asked to include something\n\nthat would make his character more relevant for the lore, or tone down the whole monster thing just a little.\n\nSame with the ERP stuff. So, a minor was doing ERP and is now so disgusted with himself that he can't enjoy roleplaying anymore. That is sad. Not embarrassing.",

Cultural sexual shame is a thing, maybe the other player in the Erp was pushy or an asshole in a way that he finds difficult to identify etc.  If you were actively Rping with him throughout all of this contempt he probably picked up on the fact you didn't like him or his content sooner or later.  \"oh I don't like your rp but I'll \\*graciously put up with you\\~ and also not actually enjoy your Rp and constantly make corrections to get it to a point I personally like\" is uh... yeah it's not sustainable.\n\nYou're kids.  You're not gonna be producing Quality Stuff tm and that's okay, don't worry about the crap the earlier 2000s sporking blogs spout off.
