For them, it's less about the story and more about the escape of being in a story, if they don't have control over their own life, they give their characters complete control.  \n\n\nIt is annoying, but there are ways to prevent it. You can play with very minimal introspection so the other characters are forced to ask if they want information as opposed to just randomly knowing everything about everyone. That said, KiK is a platform notorious for players ages 13 - 18, so immaturity is more prevalent than other platforms aimed at adults.",

BAN HAMMERRRRR!!!\n\nOkay, but, seriously, anoukdaae hit the nail on the head. When I first started out RPing, this particular problem smacked me right in the face because the chat admin was a dirty godmoding little princess and a damned tyrant to boot. That\u2019s not to say I wasn\u2019t *also* guilty of trying to make my OC the star of the show\u2014 hell, we all were, we were just dumb kids\u2014 but I do like to think I learned and grew from that experience. Hopefully, my OCs and skills have greatly improved, and I\u2019m not so obnoxious with them. Now I\u2019m just obnoxious because of my personality and loudass voice lol.\n\nBut yeah, the truth is, some people just don\u2019t learn. And they\u2019re not ever going to unless they themselves *want* to.\n\nMaybe one thing you could try is looking into a dice roll system, so hits and damage are fair for everyone. Perhaps even a simple coin toss to just determine whether or not the character get hurt. You don\u2019t have to do this, it\u2019s just food for thought.",
