            "body": "This came up recently on a forum RP site I play on. I wrote up a quick set of tips for it:\n\nI've seen a bit of discussion lately that has gotten me thinking about creative writing vs. collaborative writing. Some of the best writers I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with are or have been here on this site, and I think that's amazing! But oftentimes, the writing we're used to \u2014 and the writing we learn in school \u2014 focuses on a single writer. *What can I do to make this narrative the best I have ever written? How do I make my characters compelling and true? How do I lay out the plot? Who are the best supporting characters to highlight my hero?*\n\nHere on [redacted], I think it important that we all acknowledge our characters as those \"supporting\" characters. We should all be asking ourselves, *How do I make this player's hero shine the brightest? How can I help their character to grow, change, and establish itself?* And in turn, ideally, other players would be thinking the same thing about your characters. Here are some tips that I have put together, and I am hoping to hear others chime in as well!\n\n* **Glance at profiles/do some research** \u2014 When you hop into a thread, it can be a good idea to look at a character's profile. When you're writing solo, you already know all the characters that yours will interact with. But when you're writing collaboratively, you might not! Chances are, the things that other players include on their character's profile are things that are important to them! So if you see, for example, that a character's evil step mother has driven from their birth pack, you might jump on a chance to help that be explored, if it comes up IC.\n\nSame with threadlogs. Not everyone has time to read up on what's going on around [redacted], and that's fine! But if you have the chance, it can be rewarding to glance through a character's threadlog to see if there are any plotpoints that your character can help with. Especially PMs, our collaborative leaders, might find this useful for stirring up interest and drama in packs.\n\n* **Be willing to compromise/dip into the uncanny** \u2014 Something I've seen a lot of is stoic characters who aren't willing to interact or show any color when meeting strangers. I've had threads before where my character has made every endeavor to make a connection or at least start a conversation, only to fail. This might be fun in a novel setting, where there is an end and resolution and you're only writing with yourself \u2014 but it's not always fun for your thread partners.\n\nIt's okay to have characters like this, but when threading, try to leave an opening. Maybe your character would never ordinarily chat up a stranger, but what if they look just like your character's dead sister? What if you arrange for the other character to rescue yours from quicksand or a predator? There are plenty of ways for you to play a stoic character while still giving other players chances to figure them out, or at least to have a fulfilling thread.\n\n* **Communicate**! \u2014 Communication, as always, is a very important aspect of collaborative writing. Some players don't like to talk a lot OOC, and that's fine as well, but it is a very useful tool for making sure everyone is having a good time.\n\n* **Play a supporting role** \u2014 Ideally, every thread should be fulfilling/satisfying to all players involved. Sometimes, however, it doesn't happen by having your character in the spotlight. Pay attention to your fellow players and their \"heros\" so you can help them to succeed!",
