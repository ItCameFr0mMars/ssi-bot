Make your character the starring role in their own story! I understand that you liked the dynamic you had with that one player, but there's no reason you can't find a similar or even more exciting dynamic with someone else.\n\nPlus, you can use it as a learning experience. You said you just \"went along with what she wants most of the time,\" so now maybe it's time to figure out what YOU want and strive for that. I know it may suck right now, and you're feeling demoralized, but maybe this is an opportunity in disguise. You can put more thought into your character and come up with new directions and adventures for them, and then maybe it'll be that other player who's envious down the line. ;) Not that that should be your goal, but basically I'm just saying, don't get stuck in a rut of comparison. There's no greater medium than roleplay to actualize your character's dreams because you literally get to write and plot them out. So go for it!",

She doesn't like angst, and she wanted character development to be *easy*. I didnt want that.

All three of us basically said, \"let's see what happens\", without really knowing what we want until it's thrown at us. It does hurt a bit less when I thought about it that way. I was always ready to let the childhood sweetheart dynamic win, but it's just the inconsistent messages(\"it won't go well\" -&gt; \"oh it did.\") I kept getting that made me doubt if I should still push for it, hence the stress of it all.\n\nI don't particularly ghost people but I guess I do post for my ex-partner a little less now since our characters had to break off to save the other from drama. Though I'll try to keep in mind what you told me next time. I did enjoy rp with my ex-partner, yes, but in the end our focus/likes are just different. Thank your edibles for me lmao.
