            "body": "On a group that I helped manage about 7 years back, we had someone who made a character who was essentially a sexual assault victim, who'd grown into an alcoholic and drug abuser to compensate for the damage in their past. This character was used for about 5 months before an IRL aquaintance of theirs joined the group specifically to let the admins know of some pretty fucked up things. Apparently the person behind their character had their children removed by CPS a few months before the inception of the group (no idea the reason, but I've always hoped it wasn't the obvious), and was legitimately Roleplaying as one of his daughters, down to the full name, birthdate, and a described birthmark location. The IRL girl was 15 at the time, character was described as 19 and had been used in smutty situations multiple times. The first parts were apparent, the others weren't until we showed aquaintance the perps character sheet. This aquaintance released the individuals personal information coupled with screenshots of text conversation, as well as the perpetrators IRL name to the owner and admins. I remember some specifics, but all I will say is that the individual in question lived in Florida in the northern section, and was 39 at the time. The aquaintance was a family member that had seen the open roleplay and use of the character when at the perps house- when the screensaver was disturbed by accident. Aquaintance joined with the info provided right after getting home. We got the perp in a Skype call with us, pretended to laugh and have a good time for a few minutes before casually dropping his IRL name. To which he became incredibly nervous and spammed us with questions, left the call twice and rejoined, etc. Typical strange behavior, and convinced us that this wasn't bullshit. At one point we actually thought it was the perp on a separate account doing something for attention or a troll, but voice was definitely a woman on the aquaintance side and the perp had been in voice chat with us before and had a pretty unmistakable voice. We compiled 7 pages of the roleplay and a faceclaim that he'd provided before the ban, which turned out to be a slightly edited version of a cropped family photo. The owner of the group emailed the aquaintance all of this. Two months pass, aquaintance emails the owner to inform us that the perp was in a mental health institution (legally enforced I believe, but not sure, bit fuzzy on that), and that he had lost any semblance of custody of his children, who were states away by that point.\n\nI am cautious online because of things like this. There are some incredibly unstable people on the internet, and our little community has its fair share of em. Be safe out there folks, and to any underage roleplayers out there, I urge you to wait until adulthood before getting into RP unless you know the person personally. I've got dozens of horror stories on that end to justify that stance.",

            "body": "I'm inclined to agree with u/xvladin here. It sounds like this player is probably young and likely a little thoughtless -- changing the names at least would have been a good start. But just as an example, *Silence of the Lambs* was inspired by various real-life killers and people (Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, to name a couple). Writers are constantly drawing on real life examples for inspiration, and I don't think there's anything inherently awful in that. So much of writing and roleplay revolves around getting inside a character's head and trying to see the world through their eyes -- yes, sometimes even the reprehensible ones. One might even argue that there's a correlation between being a writer and being a psychologist; to quote some [random paper](https://jhss-khazar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/son.4._tURKEY_12.12.2016_1.pdf) I found after some Google-searching: \"Literature and psychology are two branches of science that study human soul. Psychology researches human behaviors and their causes while literature depicts human behavior through fiction.\" \n\nIt sounds like this player is just exploring some really dark themes, and while the *way* she went about it might be questionable, I don't think going down that path is necessarily a bad thing. Writing can be a way to explore some of the horrors of life without having to experience that firsthand. Which is probably why so many folks are drawn to horror and true crime and serial killer themes, all of which are hugely popular genres.",
