            "body": "You're not alone. It kills my enthusiasm and exhausts me, too. Excessive planning also gets on my nerves. By the time the RP *finally* starts, it's usually no longer a matter of my interest being sky high from \"oooh look at all that detail, such intricate story, much wow\", but rather... just my stupid biased brain committing the sunk cost fallacy. *Spent so much time talking, might as well make something out of it* and such.\n\nThis is why my brainstorming process is limited to the fundamental questions: are we on the same page with genres and types of scenes (and if it gets erotic, then kinks)? Settings? What are the characters like? What are their motivations and goals in life? How do they meet (starting scene)? Also a *rough* outline of the *first* scene. And that's it. I'm good to go. Anything more than that and it becomes a *chore* to me. That and I also think it's *useless* \\- I'd love to see someone try to change my mind about this.\n\n100% agree about leaving room for surprises (and also creative license in general). I think some details should be deliberately left vague/unexplained, *especially* if they aren't a factor yet. Doesn't matter what you came up in advance, there's always the possibility of inspiration striking and giving a *better* idea/twist/whatever.",

If our characters already know each other, I\u2019ll sometimes talk character traits, but usually I try to keep it so that me and my character learn about the other through what\u2019s communicated in their writing. \n\nPast that, it\u2019s nothing. Dead space. Neither of us know where the other is going, and every post is a surprise. \n\nIt\u2019s not for everybody, but I like to match this with a complete moratorium on writing out a character\u2019s thoughts. If a thought is too complex to be shown through an action, I shouldn\u2019t know it. Uncertainty is *good*. \n\nTL;DR: I like to write almost completely blind.

You definitely need someone who knows what you like and dislike and has a somewhat compatible style, but most importantly you need someone you can talk to. \n\nI try to keep an active OOC dialogue about how we feel about the scene\u2019s direction, characters, etc. I do this even when I\u2019m not writing \u2018blind\u2019, but it\u2019s doubly necessary during this. Just talking about what we\u2019re enjoying writing, what we think the other is doing well... and occasionally, politely, what we dislike. \n\nMost times, a conflict of direction doesn\u2019t need to be brought up OOC until afterwards and can just be addressed through the characters. For example, I include romance on an \u201cif my character likes yours\u201d basis, and sometimes that means people make a move when he\u2019s not interested. Shutting that down sends a pretty clear message to your partner, and also offers a great opportunity to flesh out a side of your character you maybe haven\u2019t addressed. \n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s not that small. Maybe the other person killed off your favorite secondary, or introduced a new plotline that\u2019s just not interesting. Then you just politely bring it to OOC and try to work out a solution.  I try to stick by a \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d philosophy and only work forward, usually by redirecting the plot, but you also have the option to just ask your partner to edit their posts. \n\nI have some instant dealbreakers, like godmoding the big bad or repeatedly pushing a sexual limit, but you can usually work through any issue as long as you and your partner have good, friendly communication. It\u2019s a bit of effort, but when it pays off, it\u2019s *really* good.",

Especially if they see you as a \"lesser\" writer.\n\nI feel like I'm going on a tangent lmao.\n\nI feel like plotting out too much creates some kind of weird expectation for the future and, in that excitement, scenes can be rushed or details skipped over to get to more \"juicy\" scenes. Or everything in between just feels boring because everything else has been planned.\n\nThose spur of the moment ideas of \"what if we went off the walls and did this?\" are the best, but I think you have to have good chemistry with your partner to be able to do that.",

In my experience, the latter tends to be more conducive for any sort of well-developed long-term storyline.\n\nThat being said, I think there's definitely a bonus toward starting the writing sooner rather than later, in that you want to find out if you and your partner will mesh or not. That IS one of the most important factors, after all -- can you actually write well together? And the only real way to find that out is to do it.\n\nThen, if you can establish a good rapport, I like to plot &amp; brainstorm along the way. Just enough for my partner's comfort level, and sometimes one of us will keep something close to the vest so we can throw in a surprise later.
