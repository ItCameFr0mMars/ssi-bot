It was our way of letting her have her character without totally taking away a backstory heirloom--because it's a civil city, with laws and officers and such. She claimed to understand.\n\nThen proceeded to constantly OPEN CARRY a dangerous weapon and handle it regularly. There were exceptions to travellers, but she OWNED A BUSINESS in this city and at some point ACTIVELY THREATENED A PATRON with the axe, then didn't understand why we said this frightened NPC was likely going to report her to the police for her actions.\n\nBecause it's a city. With laws. And we ran with common sense and realism.\n\nSome people.",
