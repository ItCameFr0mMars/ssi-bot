            "body": "You can only take your partner at their word. I understand it's frustrating, but if they're telling you over and over that they're still into it, and they're still responding (albeit not as quickly as you'd prefer), then it sounds like they're still interested. Maybe they've just got other stuff going on. Sometimes it's hard to muster the necessary creativity. Especially in this time of COVID, it's easy to get anxious and just want to immerse yourself in something mindless like TV or video games.\n\nI'd suggest branching out, maybe finding other partners so that it's not as big a deal if your \"main\" one takes a while. Then there's less pressure on them and less frustration for you, if you've got other things to poke away at in the meantime. I went through a similar phase with my longest-running partner, and I felt like I was putting too much focus on our RP to the point where I'd get anxious if a few days went by with nothing. So I just started scouting around for other stories, and now I've got a few plates I'm spinning, and it's pretty fun to have various storylines to peck away at.\n\nHope that helps, and good luck!",
