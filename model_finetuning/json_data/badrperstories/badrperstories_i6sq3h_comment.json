The fear that idiots who are sick are going out and about can make your brain not want to do the things you love anymore and you just stop.\n\nI think a big reason why people who no longer desire to rp due to irl happenings rather than being people who feel entitled to others time just ghost without warning, is cause they\u2019re scared they might get pressured into continuing the rp. It\u2019s not unheard for people to try and guilt trip others into staying with them yet the Guilt tripper not changing in the slightest.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019m sorry you got ghosted but remember, the only person who is missing out is them.

The general consensus was that you have no control over the people who will ghost you, but you can control how much you let it hurt your feelings. If someone is ghosting you with no provocation and you know that on your end, you weren't pushy, you weren't unkind, you weren't controlling - then it's most likely that they lack communication skills and would rather hide like a coward than face telling you themselves that they are no longer interested. Consider it a bullet you dodged, because if they're that immature to another human, their characters were probably more so. I know it sucks and you're left with more questions than answers, with no way to find closure beyond what you make yourself. Take whatever you have built so far and keep looking.

To me it feels like grieving without closure (no idea what happened. As far as I knew it was all going well...).\n\nIm afraid of going through all of this again only to have this happen again.
