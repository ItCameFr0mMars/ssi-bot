Don't torture yourself over someone who's not a good match for you. It happens. You could even say something along those lines about how you wanted to give it a shot but you just don't think it's the right match for you, but that you wish them the best of luck in future roleplay endeavors, blah blah blah.\n\nJust because you agree to start a roleplay with someone doesn't mean you're locked in for the foreseeable future. In my mind, the starting point is always kind of a trial run.\n\nI keep thinking people ought to try more low-pressure one-off scenes, just to see how well their writing flows and meshes. Then you'd be able to determine if it's someone you want to keep playing with or not. But don't feel guilty if they're not. It happens. Keep looking for the one that wows you, not someone you have to force yourself to write for.",
