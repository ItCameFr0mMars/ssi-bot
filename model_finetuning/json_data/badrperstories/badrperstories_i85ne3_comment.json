She'll have one other staff member who doesn't have the server privileges to approve characters, so no matter how many people come in - nothing can happen. Running a server well can be a full time commitment, but people don't get that. They just want to own their own thing, so they make it and waste everyone's time. It annoys the crap out of me.   \n\n\nWhat's even better is when they ask me or someone I know to help them run it, and then they just leave. They sign off and never sign back on, so now it's our job to run their server for them. Gah, I wish people would stahp.",

They treat servers like franchises where they just build out the bones of one, recruit a little, decide it's finished, and then they move on to the next one. Servers do not run themselves. You need to be an active part throughout their existence. I really think people just do it to clout chase. They have an idea, so they spark it, recruit a bunch of their friends, play for a few weeks, then they move on to something new. In the process, they waste everyone's time. \n\nThese are the same people who insist that all servers die out after 3 months, which is blatantly not sure. My main just reached two and a half years, because I'm online every single day. There's no secret sauce here. I'm not some god-tier Admin. It's just that if you're passionate and clearly putting in an effort, people will too. If the person who created the server can't even be bothered, then why the metric fuck would anyone else stick around?",
