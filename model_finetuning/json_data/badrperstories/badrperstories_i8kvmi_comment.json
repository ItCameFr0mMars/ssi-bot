            "body": "I had a partner a while back who would not tell me ANYTHING. I would always talk to her to get her approval for certain plotlines, see if she liked them, she always said 'go ahead'. After a while, I began to think she highly enjoyed the storylines I came up with so I continued them, incorporated more plots like that. She kept replying to our threads so I figured she was highly enjoying them.\n\nNot once did she tell me she was uncomfortable, not once did she ever say 'no' to a plot.  Then suddenly one day she blocked me on every writing platform we wrote together on and blocked everyone who wrote with me or considered me a friend as well (even though they didn't rp with her). I was hella confused so I asked around, turns out she was telling everyone I was 'abusive', 'overbearing', and just a plain horrible person. Apparently she hated everything we did, said everything was about what 'I' wanted and not her or what she wanted. I was getting death threats from her 'friends', people who didn't even know me or what was going on. (It was all sorted out months later when she was exposed with hard evidence for doing this to someone else, thank god)\n\nI was stunned. Had she actually said 'no' to any of the plots I brought up to her, bounced ideas off me, or told me, at any time, she was uncomfortable with something going on, I would have honored them and put a stop to it right away. All my partner's comfort and safety have always been my number one priority but there isn't anything I can do if you agree to everything and never COMMUNICATE that you don't like something.",
