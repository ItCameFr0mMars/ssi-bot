I\u2019m not looking for an OOC connection, I\u2019m looking for an IC one. I\u2019m good with conversation about limits and hashing further plot points, but it\u2019s the mystery of not knowing how my partner thinks (and, by extension, how their character thinks) that makes roleplay fun for me. \n\nI\u2019ve realised recently, though, that neither approach is wrong. It depends what your focus is in the hobby. Some people are in it for the social element, enjoy making social connections, and want to have an OOC relationship with their partners. Others are in it solely for the writing and development of their craft, with any friendships formed being a happy bonus. Neither way is wrong, they\u2019re just different.

It may seem odd, but to me, writing is a pretty vulnerable thing. Sure it's just fiction, but, I still am pouring my emotions into it.",

It just doesn't instill confidence and takes away the ability to really just let those words flow from your keyboard as you just go with what plays out in your mind without restrictions or concerns.

So too, does it do that for me when I am too worried and hence distracted. When I am posting, I should be entirely immersed, simply enjoying it, not get sidetracked and distracted by wondering if it's good enough or whatever. The constant worry that my partner may not like it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is especially bad when they don't give any feedback as you mentioned too because you're left wondering if they hated it or not. I am always very hard on myself, so I already feel like whatever I write isn't all that good, so naturally, my first thought when I drop a post, and a partner says nothing at all, is that they don't think it was good. The type of \"if you got nothing nice to say, say nothing at all\" deal that I feel they are sticking to or something. I tend to sometimes ask if it was to their liking when I never get feedback, but yeah. It is so vital to me to know that my partner is enjoying themselves, otherwise, I simply can't enjoy myself either.",

Especially since i always love to send memes, short movie clips and a lot of  other kind of stuff that remind me of my oc or that i would definitly see my oc do and i love to sometimes sketch them out a bit and send that to my partner (this also makes it easier for me to get more into the character i guess) If i don't have that i can't write as well as i should because i don't really feel the connection if you know what i mean?

I didn\u2019t know this guy from a can of paint basically and instead of wanting to plot or discussing our characters OOC, all he wanted to do was tell me about his best friend and how they\u2019re doing all these things together, basically updating me at every interval whilst not actually discussing anything relating to our characters or even providing a response in roleplay when it was his turn for more than a week. While I appreciate that he deemed me a safe person to discuss his day-to-day going\u2019s-on, it quickly became draining seeing as we all have shit going on and the whole reason I began talking to this person was to roleplay. I love talking OOC and plotting, plotting alone tells me if we are going to vibe or not, but as for anything else I\u2019m honestly not interested in their real life partners, what they had for lunch, what vacations they\u2019re going on, etc. It might sound dickish but I won\u2019t just sit there and pretend I\u2019m interested out of some societal pressure to do so.",

Recently quit on a partner who not only totally ignored my attempts at conversation and adding to the plot, but also played cannon characters like her own personal Mary Sues. Wouldn't usually mind but this was the one roleplay where I'll ever play a cannon character because they're pretty awesome just as they are, IMHO.\n\nI am also a literate writer, and it made it difficult as anything to stay invested. When I mentioned this, and added that two characters that should go naturally together (Aziraphale/Crowley from Good Omens) felt smooshed together by the roleplay for lack of any chemistry, she took offense and made me feel bad... As if I didn't already feel bad because my attempts at conversation were being ignored.\n\nYou deserve a partner that makes roleplay fun and not a chore. Keep looking, hun! They're out there!",

            "body": "Some of the best roleplays I\u2019ve done have had literally zero OCC chatter.  Like my partner could have been a dog for all I knew.  In my experience, I just click with some partners and having amazing roleplay chemistry with them, whoever they are IRL.  Our characters mesh really well together and the plot unfolds organically without outside input.  I\u2019m a big fan of plot surprises so I\u2019m more than happy when my partner creates a random scenario for our characters to work with.  A lot of times I prefer that to planning out events in the future.\n\nI\u2019m also extremely reserved as a person and its hard for me to talk casually with my partners outside of the roleplay.  I\u2019m down for plotting / talking about scenes but it takes me a very long time (years) to actually feel comfortable enough to open up to someone about my personal life.  It\u2019s just the way I am, sorry :(\n\nIn the end, its important that your needs are being met with your partner, whether that entails conversations outside the roleplay or not.  That\u2019s why I think its super important to be upfront about your expectations from the beginning so you don\u2019t get into a situation where it feels on sided.  Luckily there is a lot of people on both sides (those that like chatting and those that don\u2019t) so eventually you\u2019ll find a partner to fit your needs :)",
