            "body": "Cliques, man. Fuck cliques.   \nI'm always really skeptical when more than two people join a server together. Duos can be toxic enough on a bad day, but cliques will quickly take over a server and they'll never recover. I'll give a heads up to my friends if I find a cool server, but I don't actively recruit people because I know how shitty it is when you're the odd one out.  \n\n\n There's a server I'm in right now where someone joined and then they started bringing in their own friends. The first one was cool, the second one was cool. But the third and everyone they've brought in after has been such a massive asshole. They actively ignore other people's posts, refuse to write with anyone not in their clique, and they make super passive aggressive comments constantly. I could tell that when they came in, they were expecting to take over the server. When i was promoted to Mod to help out, they started getting really salty with me. What's interesting is when you mentioned the jobs your clique bragged about. The clique in this server brags about having the same jobs - one is a super big shot lawyer, another is a streamer, another is all about DIY hobbies and constantly humble-bragging about their skills. Not only that, but 4/7 of them identify as animals you listed which is just giving me all the red flags. I've tried to warn the GM about this. They made a rule about not ignoring other people's posts and not pushing clique mentalities, then the lawyer one started saying vaguely threatening stuff about how they have 60 people in their clique that they're planning to funnel in slowly, adding one in for every new player we get organically. So they clearly have every intention to take over.   \n\n\nBut every since the GM made the rule about not engaging in clique-play, it's like they're staging a coup and boycotting by going inactive. All of them have stopped playing. And we can see them trying to encourage others not to play too. Fortunately, this isn't my first rodeo, so I helped recruit a few others and while the server is relatively small, it's still fairly active in spite of all the non-rp they're doing.   \n\n\nSTG though, cliques are like plaques. They swoop from server to server, tearing them apart, then remaking them for themselves and when they flop, they move on to the next one - never having any inclination that the reason these stories keep flopping is because they're all assholes ruining the story for the people who made them interesting in the first place.",

They never acted fairly or even in discussions. I spoke with them after the facts I described in the story, and they can no longer hold me even if they jump on me in a ratio of 6 people on 1, which I find most amusing. They got nothing against a focused and serious person like I became now after I escaped their abuses, only empty insults, due to their hive mentality. \n\nThe Dog as I explained was lenient on these flaws because he was a minority, and mostly because he wasn't there for argue... I do not approve his behaviour, but I can understand it at some point...\n\nAlso my RP became eventually better in other servers, where powerplay and metagaming is forbidden strictly, but we appreciate changings and variety. \nI am having much fun with the Dog, the Owl and the Wolf in close-knit communities.",
