            "body": "When you are ghosted, is it before the RP even begins, or after a few posts have been fired back and forth?  \n\n\nI generally don't mind ghosting during the meet-and-greet phase. Sure, it's more polite to let someone know you're not actually looking for the same things after all, but if they suddenly stop replying I assume they saw something they didn't like. And honestly, at that point in the game, that's a good thing! Better to realize it early on and disengage than find out you guys have major dissonance mid-RP.  \n\n\nI would not be anxious to keep people from ghosting at this point, because they're more than likely doing you a favor. It's not fun RPing when you're not compatible!  \n\n\nThat said, ghosting once the RP has begun is pretty rude. It's worse the longer the RP has been going on, since by then there's usually some kind of OOC rapport or attachment to the plot and characters. If this keeps happening, I can absolutely see feeling anxious.  \n\n\nI think it's important not to let that anxiety affect the way you communicate, however. For some people, it causes them to 'check-in' more frequently, and in turn makes the partner feel more pressured and less motivated to post. Once they've taken considerably longer to reply than they usually do, you might try something like: \"Hey - I noticed your posting had slowed down and I wanted to make sure everything was good with the RP. If my posts are hard to reply to, let me know and I'll fix them! And if you need a break due to RL, I'll completely understand.\"  \n\n\nI discourage numerous check ins like - \"Hey, got time to RP?\" and \"Hey, how are you?\" (&lt;- when the goal is only to make them post back more quickly).   \n\n\nOne good way to get past that introductory weirdness and get a good feel for compatibility is to meet in a group environment! These scenes and threads often end up 1x1 anyway, and it lets you see how you jibe with multiple people. If you get along, you can always DM them and see if they'd be interested in doing something more strictly 1x1 with you.  \n\n\nI know \"don't be anxious\" is terrible advice for someone who says they are anxious, but I do have to add: it's so very rarely personal when someone ghosts. I know you want to avoid it, but try to look at it from a different perspective: The non-ghosting RP partner of your dreams is out there, and they're helping you get to them more quickly! I wish you all the luck in finding them soon!",

Most of my RP partners will manage to get in about one post a day (more if we've got the time), or even just one every few days. It's a far more leisurely pace than back when I was in college and the norm was for shorter, more rapid-fire responses. But nowadays it all seems to be longer, novella-length RP, and, well, that just takes more time to write! So I wouldn't worry too much. A few hours is nothing. Give it a few days and *then* you can start to worry!",
