            "body": "I wouldn't say it was your \"fault\" since you're technically doing everything right. You shouldn't be auto-hitting people's characters, and injured people *do* move more slowly and more clumsily. It still might be a touchy subject. I have two suggestions you might try!  \n\n\nFirst is totally non-confrontational. Just ask for the type of fight scene you want: \"Hey, would anyone be interested in writing a realistic fight scene? I've been itching to do one where injuries really affect how characters are able to counter, and would love something that goes on for a long while where they're evenly matched.\" Just be careful that it doesn't come across as passive-aggressive when you ask.  \n\n\nSecond, ask if they want to roll dice! I don't know what medium you're RPing on, but many have ways to roll dice. You can make up your own rules, but for example, for every attack, the person being attacked rolls a a 10 sided dice. &gt;5 and they're able to dodge; &lt;5, the attack hits. How much higher or lower than 5 determines how well or poorly they do. This leaves things up to chance, meaning they'll actually have to take some hits.",

            "body": "From your Post I can see that you are playing a single Villain against a Group of Heroes/Protagonists. So that would have to allow you to be stronger than some or all of the individually.\n\nSo I would like you to try and isolate them and go into 1v1s, it's good for you to separate them because fighting against more than one person can get chaotic and you definitely will lose.\n\nIt's not fun for anyone if the Main Character/Protagonist always wins, setbacks and stuff like that are fun and should be part of every characters story.\n\nThis being said, try to make your own character stronger than at least half of them individually. If you also are alone against a Group, incorporate NPCs and stuff like that. \n\nAlso, watch Boxing/Kickboxing/Muay Thai/BJJ/Taekwondo/Judo/Wrestling for Close Combat, watch Sword handling videos for Swordfights, Watch someone shooting down a range for Shooting fights.\n\nThe last thing I can recommend is that you make \"if\" sentences:\ni.e. \nVillain throws a Punch at Hero, if Hero blocks it, Villain will keep attacking. If Hero dodges, Villain will defend himself against a counter attack.\n\nAlso, be creative. Theres always many ways to escape an attack, I dont know what kind of combat you have, but imma give you an example.\n\nMy Opponent used an ability that turned his Surroundings to -50\u00b0 Celsius, so it was more that freezing cold. My Character used his fire ability to keep himself warm and used a Water ability when he got close to the opponent and made him literally freeze himself. \n\nUse their moves against them.\n\nBe water my friend.\n\n(Sorry if the post is weirdly worded, im half asleep)",

A lot of people don't do it and it's like they forget, your great for remembering.\n\nLastly it doesn't have to be an argument if you take a moment to tell them before the fight how you lied to do things and be honest, it's nice that your close with these people but they should be willing to make a few minor changes for the role-play. Also be respectful while addressing them so that they can't be upset, if they get upset about you addressing your needs or wants then they're not the people you want to be around.",
