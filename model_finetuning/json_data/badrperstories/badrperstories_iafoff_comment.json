Coming from an only child herself, I admittedly have been guilty of only wanting *my* characters in the spotlight whilst everyone plays a supporting role. I quickly came to realize that this was not only unrealistic but in terribly bad taste. If she loves Jack so much, she can write a novel or a series of novels about him but this is a roleplay. You two agreed to write collaboratively and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s very open to collaboration. It\u2019s not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad. I would bring it up and try to work things out because this isn\u2019t a recipe for long term success.",

She would not put me down when I introduce a backstory, but she has daddy issues, and that reflects in her characters.\n\n1: Character was beaten and sexually assaulted by her father for years, then was taken up by sex trafficking for 2 years\n\n2: character's uncle and aunt was abusive, ever since her parents didn't want her anymore and dropped her there\n\n3: character had daddy issues and was forced to do things he didn't want to do (was supposed to be the villain, but her villains were getting old to me anyway)\n\n4: character has daddy issues\n\n5: character has daddy issues\n\nand so on. It may not be large in quantity, but I do suspect she romantacizes abuse and traumatic events, especially at a young age. It's mostly all she talks about are the same characters over and over, and it does get quite tiring.\n\nalso, all of these characters listed are below 5'0",
