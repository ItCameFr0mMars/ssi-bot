            "body": "I can tell you, although it'd be hard to explain everything in short format! Essentially, it's a character-driven roleplay revolving around a rather dark world [kind of like a world where everything has consequences, there's a negative side to every faction despite the positive] and your goal is to change the world. Just-- live in it, you know? People have had a problem with actions having consequences upon joining, or having to fit in with the world, although we do have quite a few regulars who love it. \n\nBasically, this world is centered around the struggles of a New Coven. Originally, there are Seven Covens- each practicing different forms of magic, each with different beliefs and world-views. These Covens have been blacklisted by the entirety of Humanity- they believe magic is wrong and heretical, being that magic is drawn upon the lifeline of other worlds through things only known as Breaches. They claim that those who practice magic aren't even human anymore, and this sparks several wars in history. There's a varying amount of struggles, with Burning Sun being hardcore corrupt vampire Paladins, Third Moon being people who struggle with their image and trying to appear perfect while letting way too much slide in the background, Azure Phoenix entirely ignoring the outside world as much as they possibly can- \n\nIt's generally set in the 1800s, and it's a world of magic and mayhem. Here's the short intro lore- [Sorry for the length] \n\nEchelon Breach is a collective roleplay about a series of Mages that have torn open a breach in the world to be able to harness the pure magical energy of the veil. Unfortunately, creatures from beyond the aether seep into the world as a result, but the greed of many mages result in more and more Echelon Breaches. These Breaches have given birth to a unique abnormal human mutations that may result in beings of yore once more coming to earth. Each Breach has a sect; each Sect protects the world from the wrath of the Breaches. Despite the absolute power they can provide the closer one is to a Breach, the more dangerous it becomes. Rogue mages are beginning to tear more holes into the fabric of our reality, and people are beginning to use the power of the Breaches to get what they want.\n\nAs the collective amount of regulated Breaches reach a total of seven, there is no denying something strange has begun to happen surrounding them. Arch-Mage Gradior has studied the many effects of the Breaches his entire life; unfortunately, it seems that something is coming. With every new breach open, it pulls a great magnitude of power to our world; and with every selfish mage that opens a breach, the coming of that power is hastened. People seem to think they can tear open the fabric of reality with no consequences; however, many magic-born came into existence, and monstrosities make it impossible to travel without danger. The Arch-Mage claims that everyone is in danger. However, for each sect, there is an Arch-Mage- the strongest Mage in their specific Coven. Only one other Arch-Mage stands behind him, with the other five standing against. They refuse to acknowledge the level of power that comes from the breach. However, because of the respect for the Coven of the Third Moon as the progenitor of all magic and the magical treaty, they have decided to send agents to assist in forming an entirely new task-force that will be able to both travel and seal any Breach they need to. An entirely new massive Breach has been torn open, and mages from every Coven have come together to form the New Coven to combat it.",

I'm not great in huge groups but if it's on the smaller side then I would love to give it a try. I'm also free if you ever need help with your group!
