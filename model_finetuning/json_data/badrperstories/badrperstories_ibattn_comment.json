I'm not saying this is the case, but to play devil's advocate, if I were roleplaying with someone and they had a lot going on in one post, I might breeze over something I saw as possibly unrelated, such as the orbs. Or maybe they just want to keep the plot moving and get to a juicy but they are looking forward to? I'm not sure. But this sounds like a really fun story and I hope you can communicate with your partner and keep it going.",
