I want you to know that your rp ability and story telling ability can\u2019t be measured by the likes of that guy.\n\nFrom what I can tell, you\u2019re a careful, considerate, and very thoughtful roleplayer, and you deserve to write with someone who matches up to that. I am very sorry for the anxiety you feel as well.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine the frustration you must have felt when going through that. That guy sounds like an absolute tool, and it bothers me that he holds such biphobic views and thinks that there\u2019s no such thing as creative freedom in the roleplaying world.\n\nMy advice for you, apart from this, is to take it one step at a time. If you do feel some anxieties about writing and responding, feel free to take a break, reflect, and do things you enjoy until roleplaying becomes apart of the things you enjoy. there is no rush into returning to roleplay, so take as much time as you need.",

            "body": "Thank you so much for your post and hope you are having a nice day! :)\n\nI do realize this now and how wrong everything was, but it took me a while to 'process' the whole situation in my head.  Can't help but feel guilty that I have encouraged and enablied his behavior with me.\n\nTo be honest, this really angered me. As someone who's bisexual, I know what he said is not entirely truth and for me it crosses the line when someone puts their OOC emotions into their writing with me. This was also very close to the end of our roleplaying. A lot of things started adding in more and more at the last months before I decided that it is the time for me to cut him off.\n\nI really hope that I can fight off of this anxiety because I always loved roleplaying. And while this is a one big tree of rotten apples, I have met even more wonderful people who outweigh that. I still occasionally write. I am an aspiring author and novelist on the side, it is not the same as roleplaying. Roleplaying was fun to me because of connecting to other people and being able to write together.  Yet I feel like this person ruined me (and rping) so much for me that I can't shake those bad feelings and fears off even if I am wary now and learned from this experience to learn when to say no and be less hesitant if there's something I feel uncomfortable with.",
