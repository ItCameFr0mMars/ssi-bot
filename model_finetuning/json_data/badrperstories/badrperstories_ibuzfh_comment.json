Something they didn\u2019t have to create or say.\n\nFunny thing was, my partner would be aggressive toward every side character, they\u2019d try shutting down most plots, yet they did nothing to contribute.\n\nIf you feel like you can\u2019t handle it anymore, like you need to move on, drop him. Or like you said, keep talking to him about advice and whatnot. Maybe even just put your foot down and state the issues in the roleplay, kindly but firmly. One day your partner could finally come around and start being the roleplayer you can thoroughly enjoy roleplaying with.",

            "body": "I understand what you say. I have a slightly insecure partner of role too, but xe's starting to shine xir way through the game, and besides, I've been shy a lot too. \n\n(I will use an invented third person pronoun for the sake of anonimate and to avoid gender assumption. He/she=xe, him/her=xir)\n\nI think your partner may be not lazy, but only shy of not being good enough. I believe xe is not an unintelligent, but only terrified not to be good as you.\n\nYou see, at times text role play like I do requires big inventive and imagination, and at first (I RPed for two years, almost 3 y in November).\nI was clueless aswell, unsure of what to do and seeking for approval and a way of roleplaying my own OCs, let alone stage a roleplay by myself. \nWith time, I have been supported by my friends into become a moderator and then a proper Game Master, able to describe decently literate style scenes, use Npcs, stage fights or missions and such, but I had my time of being insecure and creativeless. \n\nWhile my partner of role who started to RP a year after me is hugely ahead of me. \n\nNowadays Xe is able already to RP her characters with literate style, xe judges and spots problems in character sheets, and xe is gently heading towards the way of learn how to GM xirself, and xe uses Npcs already. \n\nBut there is a catch: Xe was insecure at first, just like me or even a bit more. And I had to help xir.\n\nThe secret for me has been constantly encouraging xir into be xirself when roleplaying, helping xir to create xir sheets, gently nudged xir into adminhood so that xe would have time to learn how to manage characters and play by rules, tell xir about my past roleplays, problems, character I've met and such. \n\nWith time I had the honor to see xir to better xirself, like creating sheets by xir own, going up to literate style with less problem, keep up with my ideas, fights and such. Also since we know eachother IRL, we fed ourselves some good lore together, by watching shows or playing games that gave each other inspirations and ideas.\n\nBeing a partner with someone else to me means have a partner that takes care of you and that you take good care of xir, in a sort of parental-like relationship love. Being overly protective with your partner won't do any good as much leave them stranded. One has to gently push them into speak up their troubles they are having into evolving, or perhaps merely asking what they want to see in the roleplay, helping them to create it themselves in the process.\n\nSmall things like this can work wonders in my opinion. Understand that once we probably felt shy or unable to do these big things ourselves, do not stop to give them small hints and help wherever needed without spoonfeeding them (let them decide what to do: eg. with their next character or plot arc, always prepare an array of options for them to choose from and display them in front of them. They will slightly turn into make the RP also theirs), and then make them realise they are able of do anything like you because they are great writers themselves (and I trust that anyone who reads this message is special in their own way of writing, do not give up your dreams and creativity :D).\n\nYou are partners, probably good ones. Spend time with xim, take good care of xim and in no time, I'm sure xe'll turn into a person you'll love to RP with\n\nTL;DR: Please rethink your choice of giving up on xim. Talk with xim, give xim advice and help xim to develop their indipendence from you.",
