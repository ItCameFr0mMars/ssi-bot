            "body": "It's actually the ol' switcharoo for me. I used to roleplay as a Mary Sue, and sometimes even that slips out and i still worry about being one.\n\nWhen I was at the roots of my roleplaying hobby, I always winged every move. I roleplayed inside of a youtube stream (Yes, there are youtube roleplay streams but I don't join them anymore.), and every now and then I'd come inside and wait for someone to want me in their roleplay. This absolutely wrecked my roots, since at the same time I was experimenting with making an OC. Her name was Kit Kat (my sister knew i was making an oc and she suggested i name her that), and roleplaying as her was a flip of the coin. But doing exactly this is what caused my oc to have Mary Sue tendencies. Kit Kat was a neko with angelic wings and a stereotypical cutesy chibi innocent but also mysterious vibe. She could shapeshift, spawn weapons out of nowhere, have her dreams holographically spawn on the walls whenever she slept, make use of clouds, and so much more. \n\nWhat was so Mary Sue-ish of this array of abilities was that she had little to no physical weaknesses to combat these abilites. So Kit Kat was an umbareable god. And not only that, but her personality even varied on the roleplay. From stereotypically kind, nice, and attractive, to \"You must learn about me, for I am hiding secrets from the past that you need to go on a Scooby Doo-esque adventure to find, only to discover I am the son of [insert very powerful person]. Worst of all, I was never given critique about it. Not that I blame other people for how much of a mess Kit Kat was, but whenever she became a part of anyone's roleplays, most of the time the characters never spoke a word and eventually would leave me behind. The leaving me behind part did show me a signal that my character was a full-out mess, but I always ignored it and continued.\n\nThankfully, I've finally made it onto the road of making my OC better, with her new name being Kerris and having a lot of weaknesses and lessened power-ups. She's also got a few companions as well, who I didn't make until much later. But as I've mentioned before, I get concerned sometimes that Kerris and her friends could become Mary Sues once more, so I don't use her in roleplay as much as I'd like to. And even so, my OC's actions themselves can be Mary Suey. For example, a fandom OC of mine, has the ability to glitch-hop through universe to universe, and at the same time can make clouds out of thin air. I'm trying to find ways to combat making these characters into Mary Sues like giving them the same amount/higher amount of weaknesses and lessening their abilites, so they can become well-written ones someday.\n\nAnyone else here used to be a Mary Sue?\n\nEdit: Fixed a spelling mistake.",

I'd gauge Done Right on whether something personally annoyed me or not.  \nIf my WoW oc broke the lore \"yeah but im original because my zombie is mutating into a sheep not like those bad anime catgirl elves\".\n\nI'd generally see it better in strangers and fail to see it in friends until it became too blatant, because again, sporking community fixation, you see bad content creator and go = bad person so you're giving yourself cognitive dissonance to unpack \"oh, maybe the blood elf player who says fel is a-ok and the light is corrupting the paladin in an argument has some issues surrounding their character being in the wrong\" - because nobody really wants to say their friend is the bad guy.",
