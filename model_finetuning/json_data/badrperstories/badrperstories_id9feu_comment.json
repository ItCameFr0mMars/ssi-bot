I know r/DiscordGroupRP doesn't allow individual hub ads but you can post them as a comment to the sticky thread at the top.   \n\n\nHub/Collection servers are basically ooc servers where players can post one on one ads or ads for their actual group RP servers.   \n\n\nAssuming this is r/Roleplay they're pretty notorious for banning and deleting servers just because they don't like them without any legitimate reason. My server got black-balled from them as a \"hub server\" because we have an additional secondary server where players can post journal entries, playlists, aesthetics - all *in character*. But to them, having any other servers affiliated with yours, even like a partnership channel, counts as a hub so they can delete your ads and threaten to ban. I offered them access to our Secondary Server. I offered screen shots. They refused to even look, they just decided for themselves that my role playing server was a hub server and therefore not allowed. Honestly, they do this to so many people.   \n\n\nThey get away with it because they happen to be one of the biggest subreddits, but that only lasts so long as people keep giving them power. Likewise, on that subreddit, members get in trouble for down voting one on one threads but never for down voting group threads, on top of the fact that the primary mod of that subreddit is very vocal about the fact that they hate Discord so they frequently find reasons to prevent group servers from posting.   \n\n\nImo, they're complete trash, and I have no problem shouting that out. They have some of the shittiest, shadiest moderation practices I've seen on Reddit.",

It was a group RP centered around an adventurers guild. It was not to obtain separate roleplay from, bit for each adventure to contribute to an overarching narrative. When I finally got a response, I was told it was too similar to a \"west marches\" style hub. Which until that point I had zero knowledge of. The RP was structured differently, it wasn't a pick and plug style (which I came to discover is what a west marches style hub consists of). I admitted defeat. No group postings. Until I tried to post specifically for myself a 1x1, and 7/8 posts were swallowed by their \"spam filter.\" Which I'm certain is a shadow term to describe action taken against a blacklisted but not outright banned member. Each post, I made sure was formatted differently, was asking for different material, non similar titles, etc. Asked about it again, was told that I was being picked up from a spam filter, and they had no control over whether my posts were hidden/removed or not. Whole affair smelled of bullshit. I did a test in the end, where I posted not for discord but for Google docs and reddit PM. That was the 1/8 that actually went up. That sub is moderated by biased children.\n\nOn another note. Does anyone have suggestions for somewhere else I and others like myself can bring our ads to? I'm ready to wash my hands of that whole sub.",
