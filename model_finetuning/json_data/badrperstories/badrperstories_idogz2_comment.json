I still think it is wrong to ghost without even say goodbye or what was the problem, it is a rating of the server that may help the server and the issues you encountered, a sort of review so to speak.\n\nMy advice here would be try to find a person you can call a friend that is into RP as much as you are. It could be an IRL friend you got at school or work, or it could be a Discord one. I believe a friend will work perfectly as a Partner, because they'll think twice before ghost a person they like or know. \nMy RP communities are so close knit that we know each other by names, and despite we had some issues in the past through management and such, the RP is still gladly alive and we are all having fun\n\nI wish you to have the same luck as I had, feel free to ask further questions if I haven't been clear!",
