Part of me actually hopes that I get called out, as the person I've ranted about on here some time ago has, so far, shut down attempts to talk things through, making interactions with them frustrating. If this pushes them to talk openly, then that'd actually be great!\n\nAnd, I actually hope B) happens as well. Because... you know... nobody wants to be the villain of their own life story, everybody has their ego and said ego pushes them to be biased in recounting events. I'd take it as a learning experience, actually, to learn about a side of a story where I've felt I've done nothing wrong, except told to others -- and via their opinions/analyses, realize that I may need to take a deeper look at myself, and perhaps change - hopefully for the better.\n\nThen again in the latter case it's just the hopeless optimist speaking from within, so...",

            "body": "A) I guess, but in the end if I write a post about them here I've likely already cut them off, tbh, so there's not much they can do to me. I'd be more scared if I was still in contact with them/cared about what they felt or thought. Typically, people who I make posts about here put me through shit that I haven't consented to going through, so I feel if they come across a post it'll at least give them awareness. If they wanna yell at me, I have a block button.\n\nB) I thought I was \\[I wouldn't be surprised if I was\\] as some people get intensely salty. I recognized a username, figured out it was just a friend talking about someone else we knew. xD In the end, all of these stories are from one perspective; you *don't know* what's up with the other person. For all I know, people complaining about being ghosted could have done something and not realized it. I tend to like making friends with people I roleplay with, but I have a lot of horror stories about awful personalities- awful human beings. It doesn't *quite* sync up with RP, because someone can be an awful human being and be a great roleplayer. Of course I find the things on here entertaining, but I push myself to reflect and I get advice from others based on certain circumstances. I feel that maybe some people here may be unaware of their own shortcomings, which- you kind of have to train yourself to be more tolerant and be a better person, as a roleplay isn't just *you-* it's your partner, too. I can't tell you how many people I've cut off because their only interest was just themselves and *their* stories/plots/''my way or the highway'' mentalities.\n\nIt's a good reason I absolutely hate 1/1 roleplay. Not without roleplaying in a group first. In the end, B counts on how much you care. You can always communicate with someone to figure out why/what's going on.  However, in some cases- people are right. In others, people are wrong.",
