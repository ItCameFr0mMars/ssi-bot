            "body": "Hands down my worst OOC interaction ever was with a guy trying to argue with me about his \"importance\" in my life when we had **first** spoken only 20 minutes earlier. It was bloody Christmas, too.\n\nHours later he was RELENTLESSLY messaging me and told me about how he had been 'through' over 50 rp partners (that he ragged on for being 'fakes' and 'not good friends') and 20 jobs in a year and then all this completely unwanted stuff about his psychiatric issues. It was insane, and the entitlement was completely crack.\n\nHowever, I love OOC and I need it as a guide to understand if the rp is working for my partner. I love rp because it gives me someone to perform for, so feedback is my favourite thing! Not sure I'd say \"friendship\" is a requirement - depends on your threshold. But that experience has made me very wary of people that come off at all clingy in adverts/first messages.\n\nAnyways, your post looks to have a story behind it and I genuinely am curious...is there anything more you want to share?",

            "body": "I think it's definitely good to be wary if folks are coming on too strong, too fast. Or if they're trying to dictate, well, anything, since that's not how this works.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, roleplaying relationships can fall into some nebulous gray area sometimes. After all, if you think about it, you're creating a whole world, storyline, characters, and playing out a variety of relationships with another person (or a group of people). It's weirdly intimate (whether or not you engage in sexual RP, the intimacy is still there). And you likely spend a lot of time brainstorming and plotting as you go along -- particularly for the really fun, juicy plots that you get really invested in (and isn't that what we're all after?) So all that can definitely *feel* like a friendship.\n\nWhen you're in the middle of a storyline and it's all going great, it can be all-consuming, and you've really just got one other person to share that with (most of my experiences lately have been one-on-one, so that's my context). I think it's natural to want to get to know more about that person, share with them, chit-chat and so forth. But where it starts to fall apart, I guess, is once you realize that the story is all there is. Kind of like moving on from a job and co-workers you were once close to -- but without the \"glue\" binding you together, what else is left?\n\nAnd that can be a little disappointing, to have shared this amazing thing with someone, but once it fizzles out, it's just so much smoke. (Or, y'know, reams and reams of written pages or screen-fulls, but still). Maybe you still want to hold onto that but realize you actually don't have much in common beyond the story, and there's not much to talk about after all. \n\nI've met some lovely people through roleplay over the years I've been involved in this odd, niche hobby. But in terms of actual close, lasting friendships that sustained beyond the storyline we'd concocted? I think just one, honestly.\n\nFunny, I started this post-comment meaning to make one point, and then I think I made the opposite. So, you're right, OP! When you get right down to it, realistically, we're all just here for the role-play.",

I\u2019ve made only one close friend over the last 10 years and it took more than 2 years of role playing with her to actually begin talking about our personal lives.  Most of my role plays have been little to no OOC, some of my favorites being no OOC whatsoever: no asking about plots, no asking about scene changes\u2014only IC and us rolling with whatever was previously written.  It\u2019s super low stress to me and I love it!  I\u2019ve had a lot of long term (years) successful RPs that way, probably because the RP was the only focus.  My partners could have been totally fucked up for all I knew, but like, who cares if it doesn\u2019t effect the role play itself.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m fine with discussing plots, world building, lore, and characters OOC\u2014even friendly conversations and getting to know each other, but yeah, I never found friendship to be necessary or preferable to having a good time.",

My overall role-play expercience has been 80% positive, 5% ghosting and 15% of those who presented toxic behaviour. And those numbers are spread out over the course of eight years. Which isn't that bad if you think about it. \n\nHoweve, I am against forcing a friendship just so the other party can enjoy the role-play better and be able to write at their best. I had only been talking and role-playing with them for two weeks and on the first day they pretty much told me that they need to know me on a personal level so that they can be a 100% invested in this and enjoy the storyline. Otherwise their responses would start to degrade over time. \n\nI told them that I wasn't against us being friends but if a friendship were to occur outside of role-play then it had to happen naturally on it's own. I wasn't going to force anything for the sake of it. They said they were ok with that until yesterday apparently whenever I woke up to a message they left behind for me before deleting the server, unfriending and blocking me. \n\nSo yes, I was a little annoyed yesterday and I needed to vent.\n\nTo sum up their message they basically said that they couldn't role-play with me because I wouldn't be their friend. They even asked me how could I expect them to stick around or even tolerate the role-play if I wouldn't let them know me on a personal level? I'm sorry but to me that's just really messed up. That's not how any relationship works in the real world. \n\nOutside of role-play I would try to have a converstaion with them but they would rather discuss the role-play, the scene we're about to play put or our characters. Which is fine by me but I was just trying to talk with them outside of role-play. Low and behold I'm thrown to the curb because I don't want to be their friend? Very immature if you ask me.",

I'd also add that even through the RP *itself* that I'm doing with someone, I'm already learning all I *really* need to know about them (and vice versa): their consistency through the regularity of their replies; their principles through announcing their breaks (because I RP primarily through chat mediums); and their interest through their level of engagement overall.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm alone in thinking this and whether I'm just imagining it, but I think I've RPed for long enough to recognize the signs of when the other gets *excited* (or even better - *inspired*) from reading what I've composed for them. The level of effort just... changes, would be a way to put it? The way they express themselves, the level of pertinent detail presented back - all signs to me that they're immersed into the settings, the character interactions, the story arc.. etc.\n\nAnd that's all I need and is the ultimate form of flattery to me. I also think it's the ultimate compliment I can offer back -- excitement/inspiration snowballing off each other's responses. Isn't that the point of RP in the first place? Daydream about scenarios and worlds that are *not* part of your reality... together with someone else. To me, that's the fastest way to get me to outright admire another RPer and feel them 'close', as weird as it may sound - without having ever met them or even know who they are, where they live and what they had for dinner last night.
