You know when people suddenly start adding periods to their sentences when they normally don\u2019t? That\u2019s what I call a serious mode.

Can't you just use words? I spend most of my days deciphering what people in RL want from me (parent of young ones and hubs just doesn't ask for things?!?). I need online communication to be a bit more forthcoming. \n\nI can't read emotional cues through one word messages, and for the love of God, don't touch me! Even if it is just text. I don't like being touched and I have a vivid imagination.\n\nTldr: poking is rude, mmmkay",
