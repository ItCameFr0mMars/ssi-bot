            "body": "&gt; There was also the issue of people getting into full blown arguments, which is still something that commonly occurs due to people being stubborn with specific things or lacking communication, \n\nSo the members are the problem in this instance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; and the DM getting upset or completely shutting down with any piece of criticism. \n\nHow is the criticism being addressed?  Private chat is normally best, are these the same people that go into full blown arguments in public chat without being made to stop?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The majority of plots have essentially come to a standstill due to waiting on specific people to participate, and we have been waiting since October or November of 2019 to actually continue with the \"\"main\"\" plotline, \n\nNix the wait and move on to other plotlines or have others fill in.  Give an end date time for the people lagging behind to respond or else the plot will move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Minor plotlines have also popped up, with a handful have been created by other members of the server, though the head DM is the one mainly doing all of that. It... is kind of tiring, however, mainly due to the fact essentially all of them revolve around Transformers, Kamen Rider, or the DM's NPC or non-NPC characters in some form,  \n\nIn fairness, a lot of you have been disappearing and the DM knows their own characters won't ghost/afk like that.  Their own plots are going to have stuff relevant to their interests, does anyone reach out to collaborate with the DM?  Do people engage with the other members' plots that aren't the DMs or throw their hands in the air and go \"the DM only Rps this, this, this and this\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; One major point that does stick out to me, however, is the fact that they would always insist whatever character was the current main antagonist would get away or gain a sudden burst of strength, including when out group of characters had been successful at outright defeating them or other parts of the enemy team. \n\nThat's legit frustrating and I'd talk to them about it, is it a matter of not wanting their character killed off, wanting to reuse them, not feeling up to the limited interaction of capture Rp?  Have people gone to them privately about \"hey I appreciate that you've been running as much content as you have but I feel that the antagonist shouldn't be guaranteed escape if they lost the fight\".\n\nIf the DM can't take criticism (I find a lot of Rpers suck at giving it tbh, tone etc) then I'd probably just move on because there's group issues beyond the DM here.",

            "body": "It seems like the biggest problem here is the activity level of members. If someone doesn't respond in a few days or weeks or so, they need to be skipped and the plot must move on. The longer there's no activity, the less players will want to engage. Everyone will lose interest if nothing's happening. If the players that are needed to run plotlines can't arrange something within almost a YEAR, they clearly aren't interested. It seems almost like the DM is the only one actually doing something and that is frustrating.\n\n  \n\n\nIf you're uncomfortable in the server and it isn't working for you anymore, you're totally not wrong for leaving. You should create a new server and try to get others to join that are interested, but running these things takes a lot of dedication and rules need to be put in place in regards to activity levels.",
