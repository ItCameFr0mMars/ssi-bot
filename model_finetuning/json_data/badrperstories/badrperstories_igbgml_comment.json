A part of me was desperate to get anything going considering the clique in the server that became more and more apparent. The gay dude was acting vague with what he wanted even when communicating, not telling what he wanted and instead sending a mixed message of research having to be done on my end. The scene could've gone well and even ended on a good note hadn't so many things happened at once.\n\nIn hindsight I got frustrated from that ordeal the most, since it was my first roleplay there and how I had to go through the hassle of taking a good picture with my ID. Had it taken ten minutes instead of an hour (All channels were hidden from me as far as I remember...) then just maybe things would've gone better.",

People have lives. And have to disappear sometimes. It\u2019s nice when they give you a heads up but I myself can think of like a few times this *year* when catastrophic things have happened that had made me just ghost people. The world is falling apart, man, give people a break.\n\nThe third one... Honestly, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree there. I\u2019m not certain why you even included that one as if the other guy did something wrong?\n\nFourth one\u2014 it\u2019s a shitty and unequal rule and it\u2019s a shame that you wasted a boost, but I can also see the mods\u2019 point of view on this. You yourself said you made three characters relatively quickly... I don\u2019t roleplay on Discord so I can\u2019t imagine what that looked like, but if it looked as if you had spammed the chat or whatever with a flood of characters, then I could see them asking you to tone it down. \n\nAnd finally, you say:\n\n&gt;A warning sign was that people would post roleplaying requests, only for others to request under them not even an hour later. Creating many pings, and most just not seeking out other players to, well, roleplay.\n\nWhether it be a forum or a discord or anything, I\u2019ve literally never seen this not be the case in any RP community I\u2019ve ever engaged with. More people make ads and like to have partners come to them than seem to respond to ads, because when you make your own ad you\u2019re setting out the boundaries and terms under which you want to be approached and have creative control over the things you\u2019re going to engage in, versus the other way around. It\u2019s not rude, it\u2019s just how roleplaying functions as a hobby; you can\u2019t force people to answer ads. If I\u2019m honest, in this section specifically, you sort of come across as mad that no one was answering your ads fast enough, tbh.",
