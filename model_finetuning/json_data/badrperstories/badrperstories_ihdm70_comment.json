I suggest you to give them some more chances and try to entangle them a lot to the plot, and see how they behave thay way. \nThey may actually take effort to continue. Or they may drop it again. Hopefully they won't...\nI wish you good luck...",

            "body": "Fair warning, this is going to come across as very cynical of me but such have been *my* experiences. Might be different for you, or anyone else reading.\n\nBut I've dealt with the same - with both old RP friends and new faces - where they also drop stories and want new ones. In *all* those cases it boiled down to one thing - the characters/stories that *I* want to play as/write are something they're just OK with, but... not what *they* actually want.\n\nOf my friends, person A I've known for the longest, so I know how they behave - as their interest in a story wanes, they keep bringing up OOC topics instead of, y'know, replying to my post or even *discussing* the RP. Then comes a moment where they start 'chatting' about different *settings* \\- effectively discussing a new story, the previous one 'forgotten', over and over again. With person B, each time we 'miss' each other for a week or two (due to our sporadic online schedules), they claim they don't remember all the details of the current RP anymore, so they no longer 'feel it' -- let's do a new one. Again. And again. Finally with C, a new face, out of five times that I've seen them, five new characters were presented to me, with desires to discuss a new story each time, with absurd OOC discussions inevitably leading to 'gtg, will start next time'... :D I can go on with the examples, but I'll limit it to three.\n\nWhat do you think happened, when I decided to give them *exactly* what they wanted, regardless of how *not fun* such characters/stories are to me - just to see how they'd react? Person A was 'suddenly' on point with replies and no more merry-go-round with OOC, just story-related topics . Person B 'suddenly' displayed the memory of an elephant, wanting to continue the RP regardless of how much time has passed between sessions. With C, the sixth time was when I catered to them 100%, and on the 7th meeting... a scene actually happened, what a surprise...\n\nThe bottom line I guess is that friends or not, people are selfish to some degree or another. I just have to wonder if you've discussed particular characters/stories/themes to RP with that girl &amp; guy that weren't interesting to you but were to them.",
