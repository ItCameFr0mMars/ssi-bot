Not only was his character a Gary Stu, and that already spelled out little to no real character development, but when my characters were developing, he tried to shut them down.\n\nNo joke. My character was finally realizing that she needed to be more courageous, to put her foot down and persevere through the toughest of situations (mentally and physically, because it was a pretty combative roleplay plot), but it ended up with my partner\u2019s character slapping my character across the face for \u201cacting crazy.\u201d The two characters were dating, so I was really shocked at what had happened lol\n\nBut sorry you went through stuff like that; must be really nerve-racking.",

Most times, when I would try to anticipate what my character would do or how they would respond to future situations, when the incident came up, my character would often react in unexpected ways, causing the plot to swerve off track. So planning an RP out in lieu of improvising it never totally appealed to me. To make an RP work, I just needed a setting, fleshed out characters, and maybe some kind of jumping off type of plot point, then I was ready to just roll with it and see what developed along the way. \n\nI would talk about my characters with the other RPer, though, but it was more like \"if this happened, my character might respond this way because of this thing that happened to them in their past,\" but it was always \"if\" and \"might\" because I'd never really know for sure what was going to happen. \n\nIt can be difficult to keep an RP going if you don't have some kind of focus for it, though, that's for certain. So at least some kind of goal or some kind of event or means of stirring up some plot are also best to have at the ready.",
