Sometimes it's me that loses interest, sometimes it's them, but it just seems like at the very beginning, when you're brainstorming and going over ideas, it's all exciting and full of potential. And then you start, and it's just... I dunno. Lackluster? \n\nSometimes I can't even pinpoint what exactly the issue is, other than a lack of chemistry. The writing might be perfectly fine, in terms of sentence structure, grammar, description, etc. It checks all the boxes. But the \"oomph\" isn't there.\n\nOr that could just be my own pickiness. I want to be *excited* about the writing, about the exchange of ideas, about character arcs and where the story is headed. I want prose that's a treat to read, and that challenges me to up my game. I want to lose myself in some fictional world, since the current one is kinda going to shit.\n\nMaybe that's too much to ask?\n\nBut I have wondered if  maybe we put too much pressure on these exchanges. Everyone wants the perfect long-term partner, and let's be honest, that just *doesn't* happen all that often. \n\nSo I've wondered if it might be better to just propose a short, one-off scene in an ad. Maybe get a starter ready, include it in the ad, and prospective partners can just roll with it and DM a response. You commit to 2 or 3 posts back and forth, no strings attached, where either one of you can just walk away if you're not vibing quite right.\n\nThat way, hopefully no one's too butt-hurt if the chemistry isn't right (you can usually tell if it's promising or not right off the bat). And if you *do* like it, then maybe you can start discussing real storylines, or try to develop the current one into something more long-term, but the deal is that it's just a 2-3 posts and you're done kind of commitment. Less fuss and hassle.\n\nAnyone think this idea has any merit, or is it just further exercises in futility?",
