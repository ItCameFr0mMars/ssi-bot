If you show what you can do and what ideas you got some will overlook the age thing since it's meant more to avoid the *smiles and waves* types.\n\nSometimes smut is the issue but that depends on how it is approached. You could go all out writing every little detail or if they're uncomfortable and the plot might require something similar then you can just skip it and just move on from there.\n\nAt this point it just helps to keep looking since you're either gonna find a partner or you're gonna have messages that you can look over, analyze and improve from there.\n\nBut your platform can also help. From personal experience I use kik, a few updates ago searching was a lot easier but now the best you can do is find groups and there are plenty that exist which focus on literate groups and finding partners.\n\nAlthough it's important to remember that things like grammer aren't really that important. Yeah, it's nice to have a sentence that flows well but it doesn't mean anything if it's boring. Emphasis on literary helps chase away lazy writers since it means they'll have to put in some effort. Often when you find someone that you work well with they'll often ignore the mistakes and focus more on what's happening.",
