I'll rotate between and kind of keep them all \"fresh\" that way. You can think of it like rotating your crops! That way the soil doesn't get all used up and depleted. \n\nAnd even if you want to stick with writing, you could maybe focus on a different *kind* of writing. Like trying out flash-fiction or short stories or poetry -- something to push or challenge yourself, but still within the same field. My husband, who's a bass player and always loved playing really heavy metal, decided to try something totally new and bought himself a mandolin and started learning to play bluegrass (because as he said, it's the \"metal\" of country music!) and he's loving the chance to learn a whole new genre.\n\nThe point is, if you keep doing the same ol' thing over and over, you're bound to burn yourself out.
