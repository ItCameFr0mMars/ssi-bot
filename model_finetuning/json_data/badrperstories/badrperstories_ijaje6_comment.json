            "body": "Oh God I had one of them as well. Spanning three years, three different RP Amino\u2019s, an army of OP Gary Sues and worst of all: he was going through puberty.\n\n\nI\u2019ll call him Todd. He doesn\u2019t deserve a serious name.\n\n\nTodd entered the first Amino, hosted by a strict but nice Agent, about 3 years ago. He made an OC who could actually destroy another OC\u2019s special abilities, *forever*. Handicap them for life with just a basic projectile attack, one that would also hone in on you at a pace you couldn\u2019t outrun or even block against. And even if they hit a product of your abilities like a magic mirror you\u2019ve got hooked up with another to portal with, it would in return destroy them via that product. It was OP as heck, and was wondering what Curator even approved it.\n\n\nI was just fresh from an unofficial arc that peeps had a decently fond memory of, primarily just the beginning and a tad of the middle. Having just ported over an antagonist of mine I wanted to RP with so to know how to write her later, I had her put a bounty on two of my present heroes\u2019 heads: one dead or alive, another alive at all costs. She\u2019d also teach them one of her abilities that would allow them to create a black fiery radioactive substance that could make for a quick shield, tire out the enemy if they got in contact with them, leech restorable health or slowly weaken objects to irreversible dust.\n\n\nOf course... Todd applied for it in PM. Were it not for the arc, then definitely for a new power he wanted to have for \u201ccharacter development\u201d.\n\n\nAs my antagonist had met his young SIOC before when he was angrily butting heads with a usually more calm User, stepping in to reinforce the rule that there won\u2019t be a battle where others could get hurt or things could get destroyed, she found him again in the Library just when I got the application.\n\n\nThey had a sit-down about the new arc, just like I had one with Todd himself. In PM, he detailed his SIOC\u2019s abilities which is where I learned of their OP\u2019ness. It was very much against the rules to mess with other things without consent, but he didn\u2019t seem fazed. I also didn\u2019t want my targeted OCs or any Users associated with them being stripped of their own future stories. Says he\u2019ll just talk it over with a Cura. Ssssure.\n\n\nBut then when I ask him why he wanted to apply for the bounty as a User... I got an answer I never wanted to ever hear said in regards of the \u201calive at all costs\u201d bounty OC of mine:\n\n\n&gt; *Todd: \u201cOh, I just want to. Sounds like a very easy arc I can win in less than a week. SIOC is an anti-hero that can use this to help me become more of a \u201cmain character\u201d [term for popular and relevant User] around here\u2014 just like you. And that new ability of course, which I can reverse-engineer and have him master the entire extended system of... Ah! And that little girl sure sounds like a cute little Tsundere. I bet that when he\u2019s kidnapped her, he\u2019d want to perhaps keep her to himself for at least a few hours or so..? Perhaps even days, if she gives into him. I bet she would go head over heels for him by day one. An hour or a few days, he\u2019d certainly leave her with a \u201clittle surprise\u201d.You really shouldn\u2019t have drawn her so fierce yet cutesy~*\n\n\nEven writing it out gives me the urge to empty my stomach...\n\n\n**That OC is very much 16, and very much one with a big enough SIOC backstory that I am not fricken allowing ANY of it!**\n\n\n*And he. Didn\u2019t. Care.*\n\n\n\u2018Twas even more disturbing that he was only 16 or so at the time, me being like 17. I\u2019m no fan of lemon RP, never doing it with a stranger. My OCs are my kids, parts of my own personal history, even if I\u2019m cruel to them by staging encounters or convincing others to start a User v User arc.\n\n\nThankfully, the Agent himself that *I* messaged about his broken-as-heck SIOC swooped by and banned his character into Cthulhu\u2019s domain. My antagonist was free to go convince a more sane person that those Bounty OCs needed hunting.\n\n\nI later even used the screenshots of him asking me to \u201cforcefully dance\u201d with my underaged OC to also get him banned with enough evidence for a while, after he tried to approach other Users\u2019 PMs with supposedly very inappropriate requests.\n\n\n*And so, balance was restored to the Amino once again...*\n\n\nWere I to tell him of two of his future misadventures, then I\u2019d most likely be here all day long. Might make some posts about him, Todd\u2019s become a meme where I now RP for being the definition of \u201cedgelord\u201d, \u201cpowergamer\u201d and \u201csecond-degree peev\u201d. First degree goes to someone more deserving of the title.\n\n\nHope ya don\u2019t face any of these main-character wannabe\u2019s again!",

            "body": "I remember a similar guy with similar tendencies. He had characters that were suffering a terminal case of anime MC crisis and this comes from a person who likes anime.\n\nI had many bad cases with him and his signature character that was one of the most edgy and overpowered but dumb characters I ever experienced. Just to make a simple nod to what I wrote in the past in this subreddit, this guy almost doomed the whole server by attacking a goddess with his op character that was actually about to save the city where the rp was being staged. \n\nBut let's go over one of the bravados I never spoke about:\nIn this other server (middle age fantasy server) mostly overseen by me, he joined and me, knowing the guy, I went over his characters purposefully taking care that he couldn't pull any gizmos out of carriages, have powers loopholes that they could exploit, stuff like that. \n\nIn the end he surprised me by making his most normal among his characters the greatest example of how a power tripper can work with basically anything and make it obnoxious:\nBasically he had a character who was merely an half elf who could use a bow and a sword (I spare you the part I had to deny the approval the sword could be a war ending weapon that could talk and slice diamonds or his master that was supposed to be a phoenix that couldn't die and use flames that burned everything) and he had the great idea to create his own plotline since the one of the server \"didn't include him\" (while he blatantly choose to play a factionless character in a 4 sided war faction server).\nThe plotline was about a completely different lore and he was using characters and themes the server was nowhere near to. In a server of war about humans/mortals, he placed beings that were about to doom the world, such as a mage that froze an entire desert big as the Sahara, and summoned a dragon that he killed alone. No one else joined that roleplay, he was just rping alone. After that he went to prison over a near faction by insulting the army and placed in his cell a sort of genie that told him he was about to save the world in excange of his freedom. Then he posted us his \"event idea\". That was basically him roaming around the lands and gathering ingredients for a ritual to save the world from certain doom while other people only involvement was sit back and watch, apart from my character because he needed a blood sample from her for the ritual. He got disapproved and soon enough banned. Never rped with that guy again and I don't long him",

I myself am not on Sin though, have been there for a brief while and RP\u2019ed there like once or so until my Great Amino Community Purge put it aside.\n\n\nThis Bounty Arc was on *Enchanted Academy Amino*, where Todd also was for the longest time until he got banned for his odd behaviour. I tried to help him shed the whole \u201cI want to be the main character\u201d ideology in return for stories and interesting writing... but he really didn\u2019t want to change even if he asked me about it since he deemed me a \u201cmain character\u201d in a lot of his rants about his characters being powerful yet him being powerless.\n\n\nThen the ban happened. He went back to Sin for the longest time, then went to *Honor Academy Amino* where I have two other horror stories about him as I curated that place until drama happened and the Mino died.\n\n\nLastly, he went to my friend\u2019s WIP Mino but has been AFK ever since. Perhaps school, perhaps not.\n\n\nI hope Todd\u2019s learning. His writing doesn\u2019t seem like it, as he still tends to gravitate towards inevitable power creep. He promised with the last OC he made on the WIP Amino that they won\u2019t be gaining any superpowers to challenge his writing skills.\n\n\n... then he sold set challenge OC\u2019s soul to a demon for superpowers on day 1.\n\n\nTrial and error I suppose.",
