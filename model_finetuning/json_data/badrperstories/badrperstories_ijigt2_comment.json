Just in case they can't they don't want to lose you as a writer. This does happen sometimes unfortunately. That however is a WORST case scenario. That is not based on anything except the fact that yeah, it sometimes happens. I'm not saying that's for sure what's happening either but just a possibility and I prefer to get the worse out of the way.\n\nOn a more positive note, they might be interested in doing multiple iterations of the idea to see what they might get differently or just because they really love the idea. The fact that they're searching doesn't mean anything per say... it's more the lack of conversation from them that I would be worried about. \n\nIt would be my recommendation that you message them and ask them outright. Not so much about the fact that they are still \"searching\" but if they want to do this with you still or not.",
