I mean rp is supposed to be fun and stress free. Besides, some people may be triggered by backstories if they are too similar to their own past life. And who would want to dredge all of that back up if they are in a good place? All in all, I feel a lot of people who go to that extent in a back story are desperate for some kind of attention they are not getting in real life, so they are trying to get it here. I may be wrong, it\u2019s just a hunch. Not saying that about anyone who has had this kind of trauma in their life. I know stuff like this happens, and it makes me angry.",

However, it\u2019s a D&amp;D game so we haven\u2019t addressed *any* of the mental illnesses the characters have very much due to, you know, fighting for our lives most of the time.

            "body": "So I'll throw out an alternative voice.\n\nAlmost all of my women enter the rp \"broken\", some sort of damage whether physically, mentally,  emotionally or more than one. Sometimes it's obvious and sometimes it isn't. I don't make them that way to be quirky, special or just to be a pain in the ass. I don't enjoy ERP right away in a long-term rp and I enjoy the challenge of creating a backstory that gives them each their own personalities and flaws. \n\nMost of us have hang-ups if we've made it to adulthood, some sort of trauma that has left a footprint on who we are and changed now we perceive things. Sometimes it's bad enough to cause changes to our mannerisms, decisions or behavior. To me, that's life.\n\nOne of my women was from a heavily abusive household growing up. Having experienced an abusive relationship in my past, this particular character has actually helped me grow as a person. As I imagine, what motivates her to act as she does now and how she reacts to situations and men, I find and see similarities in my own life. I have had several 'huh' moments over the years from rp with her and been able to explore myself and recognize my own reactions in RL and how I might still have some scars and behaviors from it that still surface even twenty years later. \n\nI know it may not be a popular opinion and I'm definitely not ever suggesting that anyone should ever RP in situations or characters they find upsetting. Never. For me, it's a challenge and with at least one that is oddly therapeutic. I know some play depressed, characters with mental illness or stockholmed characters haphazardly and without any backstory or insight into how crippling such things can be. Not all are like that and dark themes or backstories aren't always surface or without RL education or insight. \n\nAnyways, just my two cents and weird point of view. \u2665",
