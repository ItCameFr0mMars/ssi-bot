I know you feel like you have lost or killed something but RP servers are rarely stromg enough to keep chugging. There is an end eventually, sometimes it is drama, other times people grow apart or a member/admin that did a lot of social or mechanical leg work leaves and they where keeping the place alive. \n\nI am curious to hear more information about the discourse over the game mechanics people didn't like. I have been in that position before. I am the one keeping this place alive so it runs how I want. With my experience, I find I am right most of the time but I haven't always been right. Sometimes I am forcing too complex of a concept on a group that isn't ready to raise to the challenge. It can happen and bits of self reflection durring a break are good for your next project. Group RP is a lot of work, and finding dedicated people to put in that work is almost impossible.",

I myself still can't believe that everything happened around something so ridiculous like a game mechanic. However I think that you have been doing your best everyday in there to keep peace and to prevent drama. Perhaps you still feel stressed about all this, which is totally understandable, so I suggest you to give yourself time to heal, distract yourself. I know this is a boring and banal advice, but don't think about this over and over and don't think that you are a bad person or that you can't do anything right. You did your best there, despite all the stress, despite all the troubles you kept on going.

In the server there are mostly characters who use magic, so the mechanics consisted of a magic system in which you have a total amount of mana and after you had used all of it you couldn't use magic/ the characters needed to rest or something. To me, it was all complicated and ridiculous since you can use turns and such, the characters xirselves know when they use too much magic. There was no need for a new rule and basically change all the server for this. \n\nAlso, I see your point and I agree with the fact that group RP is a lot of work, many times I have been stressed out as an admin. I have seen many servers die too, many also in a bad way, so I hope that servers I join will last as long as they can.",

            "body": "Roleplay servers that have combat are a mess to run. Action is extremely hard to write at an amature level and tends to also attract a lot of self important god mod boys that have no clue how to write cooperatively. I am personally at the point where I almost never RP action in general. It is absolutely the hardest thing to handle in a group roleplay. \n\nMany people incorporate D&amp;D/general table top elements in action role play as some sort of natural stopgap to god modding, and this can work. As someone who has spent a lot of time making my own table top RPGS that have a heavy focus on roleplay I can attest to that. I do also understand frustrations with it when the real want is just to do creative writing. I rather not bother with a dice to pace my fight when I can know how to pace things. This requires higer literacy and experience levels however, and then leads to the problem of vetting people more thoroughly. \n\nThis is all beyond frustrating to uphold, and honestly more work than anyone actually understands. My advice to anyone is just just do what your DM/head mod asks. Especially if you don't have a lot of experience. If you have a good relationship with the mod and they are not just a power hungry but they will think about critique you have. If the mod you are dealing with is an asshole it isn't worth being there.",

            "body": "I agree that they can be a real mess. I have been in a server where hardly anyone had experience in combat, so many broke rules and god modded. In this server I am in now we also had a member who messed up a lot during fights because of his character who had incredible powers, in fact he got banned at some point, also because he was on the point to mess the entire server up. However I think that fights make the server less boring, even though they can be hard, I myself have still to learn more. I also had to watch members who were autohitting and instakilling.\n\nOverall, there are many members who have pretty good experience in fights though, but this person asked for the system because xe was afraid of characters of another person who are slightly more powerful, but this person said that was not going to do impossible things with them, so xe was actually very collaborative about it. Consequently it is stupid to change the whole server with this system and ruin fun for other people just to make one person happy.\n\nWe had a good relationship at first, but after all that happened there is only one admin left, who is the owner of the server, because of all the fights, but I am still in there, hoping that things will sort out somehow.",

            "body": "To be completely honest, this one is a server made by quite decent people that are actually competent and good enough since they use literate, and as for now no problems were encountered this far apart from a player that got removed for xir godmodding and MC tendencies. But one of the admins (I was one too few days ago) kept on insisting over this rule that is basically something thrown out from an rpg, mana points and all. In a server where being a mortal or more importantly a human was heavily recommended, more powerful and magical creatures would have got bigger mana pools and experience.\n\nNow you tell me who would like to be a human mage with a limited pool of idk 200 units when an elf or an half demon can get one of 400 beside for roleplalying value?\n\nPlus, only mage were considered in this eventuality of rule as the proposer of this reform actually only pictured that some character could have just kept spamming fireball over a city until it was dirt and rubbles (despite that would have been stopped ooc-ly by me in an instant if that was the case), while archers could have just kept spamming arrows in the same way or warriors keep on bashing with no stamina bar.\n\nTo me it was and is an overkill and superficial rule of realism that only debuffed the actual human mages of the server while it welcomed outwordly creatures with bigger magic powers or other class just for a whim of thinking \"mages are op\" which I can assure you they aren't and instead they are one of the most considered class regarding their powerfulness.\n\nSorry for haven't replied before, I didn't had time to read through the comments, I hope I explained myself and you understood the issue",
