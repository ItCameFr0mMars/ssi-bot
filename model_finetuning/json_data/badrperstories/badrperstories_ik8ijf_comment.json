And guys who try to sneak kinks into normal rp.  And guys deciding that they are in love with me because they like my OCs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have some wonderful male partners now that I'm older, can spot red flags from the get-go, and can maintain firm boundaries.  I stick to men who are mid 30ish-early 40ish who prefer to stick to partners their own age  (Their preference for age appropriateness is super important), don't really do smut, don't do fandoms, and basically live in the historical fantasy genre.  So the men I rp with now are basically all just chill dads who used to play D&amp;D.  The difference has been night and day.",

Before anyone even tries, no, I\u2019m not talking about transgender people. I\u2019m talking about men and women who pretend to be the opposite gender to essentially cat fish someone). I don\u2019t put my gender up in rp ads to specifically avoid the problem of attracting someone who might only be in it in the hopes of gaining nudes. \n\nI do get a bit awkward discussing NSFW stuff or smut mostly because.....I\u2019m talking to a random internet stranger about a mostly private thing. Then again I can be an awkward person sometimes so that\u2019s on me, I do communicate though.\n\nTo answer the disinterest in sex, there is such a thing as asexuality or.....not having a high sex drive. Given most rper\u2019s dictate a lot of stuff on their respective sexuality or horniness, yes, it\u2019s possible to be a healthy adult and not wanna bang. People also do pretend to be \u201cmeh, not into it\u201d then.....your poor character finds themselves being violated without consent from the supposedly not into smut character.\n\nHyper fetish\u2019s creep me the fuck out.\n\n19 year olds or anyone with teen in their age can tend to be a bit entitled when it comes to rp\u2019s and give themselves more credit than they should. They don\u2019t take criticism well nor do they really stick around anyway.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve had a bad experience with dudes. I\u2019d also kill for some sci-fi partners who didn\u2019t want some cliche \u201chumans are the only creatures that exist\u201d setting or were open to non human aliens. What I wouldn\u2019t give for my characters to not be called furries for once cause *gasp* aliens are literally anything that doesn\u2019t come from earth, if a human was born on mars they\u2019d be considered an alien people do your research.\n\nThat being said what were you looking for exactly?

This point is admittedly anecdotal because I can only really attest to my Highschool and College experience, but these classes don't appeal to guys. Because of this lack of appeal at earlier ages, there's a sore spot for the writing side of things but not for the \"theatre of the mind.\" This preference thrives on lack of information so far as the lack allows ones mind to fill in more. In other words, for some, less words makes a more detailed scene and holds attention better.\n\nAs for the sex thing, I'm lucky and I need romance or at least context, but not all guys need this and because of society many guys don't get the attention they need. These two things mix together to make a problematic situation where genuine connections are what's actually needed but pushing for sex is all one may know, particularly someone who is internet bond and porn is their only real view of women.",

I am male IRL, so I can just step away from that creepy bullshit and not be followed by it. Although, Jesus, I had a dude assume I was secretly a girl because I played as one, and I could watch his demeanour change in real-time as he convinced himself I was female and became more condescending and domineering toward me. I could have done a Hunter S. Thompson-style expos\u00e9 about it.\n\nI have had girls sneak their own fetishism into RP, or attach IC feelings to me outside of the writing, but the disparity is very real in my own experience, and I am with you in solidarity.",

I used to be a bad writer, and I'm a woman. I've met plenty of shitty writers, who are woman. Its not really fair to box them in like that!\n\nbesides, it's not a situation of me just being \"lucky\". plenty of the role players I deal with, are men. it's not really fair to have a few bad RPs with some guys and just say men aren't as good as it, or that they do it inherently differently. men are just as good as it as women, they make the same mistakes. they might be a overly more smut-oriented sometimes (depending on the person), but that's about it. they can be creeps, but so can girls.\n\nfor example, I'm doing a DBH roleplay on discord. my roleplayer friend is male, and has double the literacy I ever will. he regularly breaks the discord writing limit TWO TIMES OVER (4000 words or more) and he's awesome. my b e s t online friend. if I were a male roleplayer, I'd feel kinda hurt to hear someone say that just because I'm a dude, people don't wanna associate with me. I mean, guys aren't this bad. usually. and I've met pretty creepy girls myself, especially considering I only play dudes.\n\nI respect your opinion, but the title, and general way this is written out makes you sound kinda mean? no, not MeAn, but rather.. jumping to conclusions. you had bad luck, we get that, but to assume that most of the men on RP are illiterate horny dummies is not very kind, and ALSO making the VERY wrong assumption most women don't wanna RP with men at all is also W R O N G. (also, \"Then I need to deal with some kid on the spectrum that has never kissed a girl before sending me harassing messages about killing and raping me until I block them \" as a person ON the spectrum, ASD jokes aren't cool man, kind of a low blow)\n\nyou're generalizing, and have had bad luck. that's all.  \n\n\nEDIT: word",

It is infested with horny folks and general low quality(and cringy) stuff and people. Hell that's why I'm so hesitant to start a rolereversed roleplay because I'm scared of the romance people.\n\nAs for the pretentious rpers. It seems to be less of a male problem to me. From what I've seen the more they write or are \"advanced\" the more stricter and dead set they are in what they seek in an rp. They don't seem to be too keen on expanding their horizons.\n\nAlso as an Asexual I have some very strong views on this but I think it's a mistake:\n\n&gt;Some will pretend they are \"different\" and not interested in sex, something I'm not completely sure a healthy adult person can be.\n\nNow on to what I wanted to say. I think most male roleplayers are new and there has been an increase of more male roleplayers who are now going through their own \"Mary sue\" phase female roleplayers have mostly grown out of. I believe that most roleplayers are indeed female, who got their start from writing fanfiction of their favourite novel. Both fanfiction and reading novel are also majority female. This probably made the transition to another writing medium easier.\n\nMost male roleplayers probably came from 2 things: DnD and Gaming. DnD has been surging in popularity recently and going from DnD to literate roleplay is very natural. In Gaming RPGs(Dark souls, Witcher 3, Skyrim,etc) and roleplay in non RPGs(Roblox roleplay, GTAV roleplay, Minecraft roleplay, etc) have been becoming more and more popular. It's possible many made the transition from DnD and Gaming. The problem neither of those are literate medium which has caused a bumpier transition for male roleplayers. Many are either children and Neckbeards who were bored with those mediums and wanted more roleplay-heavy mediums and thus jumped on to literate roleplay. It's also probably has some relation to the explosion of anime.\n\nI made the transition from LARP so it was kinda hard for me too but I didn't like the fact that so much detail had been lost because I was too lazy to write a lot to describe stuff I would act out(Also made easier by the fact that I had one partner for more then a decade while I was growing up and adjusting to strangers over the internet was hard.). The difference in mediums was quite disorienting.\n\nThat's my theory anyway. \n\nGiven them half a decade(Or an entire decade) like the female roleplayers and they'll probably grow out of it.....hopefully.",

For a lot of people, the only 'roleplay' they've heard about is dirty so they think ALL roleplay is dirty smut. The amount of times I see people looking for dirty sexting when they are posting on the roleplay subreddits is almost mind-boggling and it's usually men. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the idea of being able to come in and say \"I'm the gorgeous Alpha male and our characters will eventually end up together\" is very attractive to people. If you get to aggro and OP at a desktop game, you're liable to be put back in your place, have the system tell you that you can't do that, made fun of, or just kicked out by the GM and that just isn't a concern in the anonymity of online literate games.  I think some of it definitely comes from not having a strict system for the games as a lot of what a character can and can't do really comes from mutual respect and communication with your partner.   \n\n\nThough I will say I don't know if you're quite on the money with giving it a decade because there will ALWAYS be new people coming into writing that need to work out that Mary Sue phase. As one class graduates, another enters the halls of online literary roleplay for the first time. Beautiful concept, frustrating as hell to deal with when you run into someone in the middle of that growth and they come in all ages.",

Yeah it's fun to make fun of idiots who didn't even read your post, can't type a proper sentence to save their life even with autocorrect, and act weird ooc. The funniest thing about this is that it's completely universal among all sexes. I've been in the block and have been deep in what could probably be considered the worst roleplay communities for this to happen. Yeah, I'm a smut writer. I've almost exclusively done so for about four years at this point, and let me tell you.  \n\n\nBoth sexes suck at it. I get low effort posts from guys and girls all the time, except you know what I don't immediately think? \"Oh this person is obviously a male and probably sucks at writing.\" Because that's undoubtedly false. In fact, I have a historical high of about 75% of my all time favorite romps being with male writers. If you actually have a discussion with most of them, I find that they usually try harder. Go to any of the major subs and you'll find eloquently written prompts and ideas from Male posters with at most two or three upvotes. Then you'll go to the top and find one of the most generic sounding things out there with barely a paragraph of context written by a female on the front page.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you've just been dealt a few shit hands when looking for partners, but if you're experienced enough to write such a know-it-all sounding rant, I'd assume you know how to weed out the terrible partners without even having to respond. Never once have I had someone blow up on me because I asked to drop a story or didn't prefer their style. By that logic, shouldn't I be defending and saying that it never happens with a huge and broad blanket statement? No, I shouldn't. Because that's stupid.   \n\n\n&gt;\" It just seems like this doesn't actually exist. There's *no* male players that are both \"elite\" and capable of holding frank discussions about what they are after. *If* they exist, I don't know where the hell they are hiding but it certainly doesn't seem to be Reddit. \n\nA broad statement like this does not make me empathize with you. Referring to yourself as \"elite\" makes you sound like you've got an ego for miles. You've done nothing but bash people in this post for not aligning perfectly to how \\*your\\* ideal writing is performed.",

Or even at all, being reptiles?\" Etc.\n\nBecome enthralled with some premise that doesn't fit into the active story, such as a steampunk version of Ancient Egypt and how it would function.\n\nEngaged in RP at a time when I wasn't entirely feeling up to it, resulting in poor quality of responses, and generally dragging out the scene into something more boring than watching Bob's Burgers sober.\n\nLet emotions from real life interfere with my portrayal of my character, or let my character's emotions bleed through into how I am feeling.\n\nHad more characters active in a scene than I could properly control.\n\nBecome fixated on one specific aspect of the post and failed to recognize the context, or other major plot points within same post.\n\nFumbled the personalities of my active characters to the point where they lose consistency, or act completely opposite to their character.\n\nOverused vocabulary to the point where my partner failed to understand the interaction being narrated\n\nExcessively attributed things to analogies, without my partner knowing the reference material to which I was comparing.\n\nBeing overly cinematic in planning how things should play out, and getting flustered when the scene takes an unexpected turn. (Doesn't happen often now, but my first few times leading a scene that didn't go according to plan led to arguments.)\n\nThere are probably several other flaws that I haven't noticed with myself, or failed to list from memory.",
