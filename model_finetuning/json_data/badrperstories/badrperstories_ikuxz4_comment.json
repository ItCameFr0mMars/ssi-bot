One mod tells me to mark nsfw if I want 18+ (not smut in the server, just not wanting rp with kids) and another with say my post is removed just for having the nsfw flair. \n\nI never get a straight answer. If I believed I was banned for doing something that was actually wrong than I wouldn't bother trying to go back. Unfortunately your sub it the biggest when it comes to exposure and since that's the best shot I have at trying to show off group plots then I have no choice. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm tired of asking what I did wrong only to be pushed aside because nobody wants to work with me. Posting in your sub is a gamble. Either you're accused of posting for sex, your posts get marked as groups when they aren't, or you're removed for some unknown reason with a link to a rule that doesn't explain anything you did wrong. Maybe, just maybe you get lucky enough to have your post up.\n\nI've tried talking to mods probably about six times now. Granted all have been on various accounts. I get different answers everytime and I have tried my best to be nothing but nice. It's getting ridiculous.",

            "body": "I'm late to the party but oh well\n\nI've moderated other online groups/forums for about 5 years, outside of Reddit (though with work, school, and family, I stepped down from moderator on those forums and I'm taking a hiatus). Adding on to what someone said previously, it's easy to see burnout. I've seen fellow moderators just skim over a post, say \"this breaks the rules\" and just delete it without ever telling the user what happened. However, if they read over the post more thoroughly, they would see that it in fact doesn't break any rule. That's what's happening here. \n\nThen the user asks, \"Hey, what happened, why was this removed/why was I banned?\" Afterwards, the moderator proceeds to either ignore the response, hand it over to a moderator with seniority over them to put out the fire they started, or point to some rule and say \"lol u broke this.\" A proper response would be to look at their post again, go over the rule with them, and explain what was wrong. \n\nFor example, in one forum not too long ago, there was someone who posted their Discord server, which we didn't allow at all. It fell under our \"no advertising\" rule, which was listed as an example of what not to advertise. I warned the user and took down the post, only to get a message from them later asking why I took it down. I quoted the rule, told them we didn't allow the advertising of Discord servers, and explained to them why we didn't allow it. Of course, they weren't happy to hear it, and became belligerent, but that'll happen from time to time. \n\nOn the other hand, one mod from another forum (who was demoted for several counts of this kind of situation) just took down posts willy-nilly. At first, they were great. They communicated with users, posted often on the forum, warned users who broke the rules, so on and so forth. However, after about a year, their performance slowly became lackluster. They were clearly burnt out, but they didn't want to give up their position. I can't speak for them and say exactly why, but my guess would have been the slight power trip and high that sometimes comes with the smallest amount of authority. Anyways, one user would post at least 2-3 ads per day, and one of our rules was something along the lines of \"no spam.\" The moderator in question took down the posts without saying anything. This prompted the user to make another post on the forum looking for the mod who took their post down. Before the owner or I could even see the user's post, the mod would take that post down as well, which resulted in the user messaging me, the owner, and the other moderator. The owner and I, of course, replied to this user, promising to look into it. Neither of us remembered taking down any of their posts, so we went to the other moderator. The moderator just said \"they were spamming and posting unrelated content, so I took their posts down.\" The owner and I were a bit upset with this, so we went back to the user and of course, apologized for the other moderator's incompetence. We explained that posting 2-3 ads per day falls under the spam category, and since they waited so long to get an explanation, we only gave them a friendly reminder (not an official warning) to not do it again. Like the previous user, they became belligerent and were banned for swearing and spamming the forum with slurs and insults. \n\nYour sub can be improved in so many ways. I know moderator burnout when I see it, because I've seen it and gone through it myself. If you're not willing to take a break or step down, then at least promote and train new mods who can take the reigns while you and the other burnt-out mods take a break. I understand you have a lot of posts to go through every day and probably have a lot of people asking you questions, but the least you could do is communicate a little better. Be transparent, don't just say \"you broke this rule, have a nice day\" without explaining exactly what it was in the post that was against the rules and why. It's just lazy moderating. It's quick, sure, but it's lazy. If this is too much, like I said, promote and train more mods so you have some backup. It's hard to enjoy a large server when posting ads becomes gambling whether or not their post is gonna get removed. \n\nAbout this user (OP) in particular, yeah, they definitely shouldn't have ban evaded. Ban evading rubs me the wrong way too. But their original issue is legit, and it's happened countless times before, and not just on your subreddit (or on Reddit itself).",
