Rp is supposed to be fun, you should have similar standards to begin with and crit should be occasional and delivered properly.  She shouldn't be berating you into apologies it should be more like \"orite my bad ill change up x\", she shouldn't be throwing a tantrum when she gets a microgram of what she dishes out.  At that point you have a person who cares more about \"I'm right and this thing I don't like should change, it is disobedience not to but if you criticize me You're Attacking Me\".  That's a person who assumes they're 'in charge' to an extent that's completely unhealthy for a friendship.  It's narcissist logic and honestly, the friendship is already damaged by her attitude.\n\nFor one on one play you should have more or less the same standards already, it shouldn't be this weird crit-every-week drama thing.  I'd break off Rp with her and whatever you do, hold to your no no matter how many strops she throws in response.  You get to say no to Rp, even if it's 'unfair', even if it could have been fixed (It can't).  Don't do that dialogue with videochat up though.",
