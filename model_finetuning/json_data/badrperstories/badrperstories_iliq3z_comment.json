            "body": "Yeah... Especially when it seems like no one outside of the KH fandom even *knows* what sea salt ice cream is. (I know it was a flavor at one of the Tokyo Disneys, that's why it was put in KH in the first place according to a rumor I think... But still, every non-KH fan I've talked to stateside about sea salt ice cream tends to not even know it exists until I mention it...) On top of the fact, every store I've been to never seems to have plain sea salt ice cream. It's always caramel and sea salt, not just sea salt. What I mean by all of that is that most people automatically assume sea salt ice cream is a KH reference.   \n\n\nAt least it was only some awkwardness? But it's only natural in my opinion for people to associate sea salt ice cream with KH because that's how most of them even know sea salt cream exists in the first place. (I wouldn't know it exists without KH.) But if she drops you because you like KH and she doesn't, that's a yikes.",
