Those who deserves it are people that do disrupt others RP's, those who ghosts, those who insult other people over an hobby, those who ruin the fun wanting to be the Rp's protagonists, those who are jerks.\n\nI've been in your position before many times, I've said the same things more than one time because I felt insecure and I thought I was doing a shitty job, but remember that when you RP you have an empty canvas to draw on. You can be everything and you can fit everything in it. So you are not a laughing stock to me. You may meet people that will tell you that you are \"talking down of yourself\" while you are in this phase and that you are stupid by doing that. Don't listen to them, get things wrong is fine and happens everytime. The more you continue to write, the more you'll improve. The show must always go on, I know you can do it... Just take a break for a while if you feel drained, but keep on hoping. \n\nAnd also... If You can or feel to you should try to explain us your past experiences to us...

Maybe it's just a bad period, I don't know, but don't throw away anything, perhaps you will feel worse if you do that. You shouldn't compare yourself to others, it's not a race, it's not a job. And this is coming from a person who compared to others many times, always asking myself \"what do I miss? What has this person that I don't have?\"  \n\nI think though that it's experience that builds your writing skills, so I know that you can improve yourself writing more and more.

A lot of people are constant jerks who ghost people for no absolute reason, and it may only be people are not pitying you because you may be genuinely great for them.\n\nTake your own judice as your account and try to write something for yourself and your enjoyment only, without bothering let other read it but keep it for yoursel I've wrote pretty cringy stuff too (now erased for shame) but that didn't stop me from learn from it and get better. I can also suggest you to go read something in springhole.net, since it is a gem for writing tips as a writer and a roleplayer\n\nI suggest you to take a look there, and not to give up your dream...

With the amount of English books I have read one would *expect* my vocabulary would be decent by now, but it isn't. I am stuck writing like an eight year old\n\nSecondly, the character that I write as is annoying. She is far too emotional and does what she wants. Since I mostly write smut roleplays that means I can't always get to the smut scenes or make them go as perfectly as I'd like. Sometimes she would rather snuggle. \n\nThirdly, I am just all over *bad*. I always end up with writers who write 300+ word replies and are over all really talented. So my writing looks so painfully bad compared to theirs. Whenever I read back the stories I just... am ashamed. \n\nI usually give partners compliments when it's due, telling them I am really impressed by their writing, or more specific compliments about what I like about their style, their character writing. And I have legitimately never ever received a compliment back, which only makes it more clear: I suck and they can't find anything positive to say about what I write.",
