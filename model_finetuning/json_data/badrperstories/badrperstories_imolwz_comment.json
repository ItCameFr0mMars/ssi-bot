            "body": "I\u2019m of the same philosophy as you. I never liked photo face claims\u2014 it\u2019s one thing to use a FC for something totally PG, but especially if things get *adult*, I find it endlessly creepy to imagine a real life person who I probably recognize because everyone uses famous models or actors for their FCs naked and doing all manner of stuff that I\u2019m sure they\u2019re *probably not comfortable with*. \n\nLike, I\u2019m aging myself internet wise here, but I\u2019m probably not the only person who remembers the occasion on which [the Sherlock actors were asked to read out a slash fanfic](http://teleread.com/sherlock-actors-read-slash-fanfic-out-loud-at-season-3-premiere-fanfic-author-not-pleased/index.html) and how horrible that was for *everyone involved*. I wasn\u2019t even in the fandom and I\u2019ve never watched the show but I remember how embarrassing it was to even see secondhand. A huge identity of those characters in fandom was tied into their real life appearances as everyone strived to get the art to look like them. It\u2019s not quite the *same* as real-person fiction but that was the best and clearest example of that sort of boundary being broken and it was all I needed to be like \u2018yeah, nope, not gonna do this\u2019.\n\nI also really think, aside from the identity issues, that using real person FC is bad for another reason, that being that it *severely* limits the sort of character you can use in an RP. Mandating IRL face claims is pretty much the quickest and easiest way to slap an \u2018attractive characters only\u2019 label on a roleplay without saying as much. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t find good photos of less conventionally attractive people. It\u2019s just really, *really* hard. Add in any distinguishing feature like a disability, and it\u2019s practically impossible.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve built up a big library of commissioned art of dozens of characters, so that\u2019s usually what I use. Failing that, I use descriptions. Characters I get attached to, I eventually commission art of. \n\nAfter a huge falling out with an ex, though, after dropping literally hundreds of dollars on couples art of our characters, I really reassessed my policy on getting art of pairings. I only do it very, VERY rarely any more, and I definitely don\u2019t spend as much money as I used to. \n\nI never thought to watermark the things I commissioned, though. That\u2019s a good idea. I might steal that.",

            "body": "By all means, please steal it! I watermark it with my discord since people have stolen art before. As for pairings, me and my RP partner have our characters exclusive to each other [they actually got me into commissioning around when I met them 7 months ago]\n\nThey were the first to get a piece, so I thought I'd do the same. Since I redesigned his appearance we have have a few of the new ones, but we go about 50/50 on it, and talk ideas often. I'm not afraid of someone stealing the art since like I said, it's all watermarked.\n\nCurrently the google slides is being renovated, so it's got most of the info scrapped in a copy of it while I redesign it. So the information you see there [minus names and generation for the Zhang Bloodline] is pretty much N/A.\n\nA couple are OC races since I wanted to have fun. Feel free to check it out! [What can I say, I love showing it off.] Because of the things mentioned in my post, I recently added 4 pages at the end of the slide for 'Frequently asked questions' that I get, just to avoid them being asked and problems arising from it on either parties part.\nThat's them. I only have 12 of them in there, but I have 13 technically since 'Calico' had an old design and used to be a 'Yuan-Ti Pureblood' instead of a 'Triton'\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, the companions art is NOT owned by me, I only borrowed it while I save for commissioned art of them. Sadly the artist who was doing it bailed on me after some things went down.",

            "body": "I think the way you are doing things is fine, but one possible reason why some people react poorly might be because it seems a bit too 'Sears catalog' for some. Instead of sending them the entire gallery you may want to try instead picking one out yourself and presenting that lone image so it feels less like the person is shopping through offerings that they may feel have already been picked through.\n\nI know that isn't really how it is, but emotionally it might feel that way for some people. People usually want to feel special, especially when it comes to roleplaying. You could still discuss character creation ahead of time, but when it comes down to choosing the image maybe don't give them the catalog. \n\nAs for the face claims issue, I largely agree and I use drawn representations of my roleplay characters as well. Unless I'm roleplaying a fandom character that *has* an actor attached it often feels weird to me to slip someone else's face onto my characters like that.\n\nI make a new character, new and unused appearance for each OC I make, but I'm able to draw my own so I know that changes things and not everyone is able to do that. I also basically only roleplay with one partner currently. She and I have a bunch if pairs together and only roleplay those characters with each other, so our dynamic is very different from what a lot of other people do, I think. If I didn't have one main steady partner and I was searching for partners in various places that didn't always last, I'd likely get tired of drawing a new face for every character so I can see the appeal of having that 'catalog'.",

The whole idea of focusing on face claims in general is a little strange to me.  You don\u2019t (often) see them presented in fictional novels, so why would you see them in role plays?  When I imagine a story in my mind, all characters appear nebulous to me anyways.\n\nHowever, I totally understand the appeal of commissioning/drawing your own character concepts.  I\u2019m also an artist, so I\u2019ll draw mine (and theirs) on occasion for fun.",

If I had to wager a guess, I kind of feel like people who use real life FCs perhaps do so because they're attracted initially to the actor/model/person represented, and *then* try to build a character around that, versus the other way around where you put a lot of thought and care into building a character from the ground up. \n\nThat old saying that 'a picture is worth a thousand words' seems to be true here, although in a *bad way*, since RP is primarily a *writing* hobby and if you're spending all your time looking for a visual aid instead of practicing to write, the results will be lacking.",
