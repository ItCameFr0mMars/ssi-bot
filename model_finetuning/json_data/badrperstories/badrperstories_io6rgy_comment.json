This isn't an 'LGBT getting too toxic' issue but this person being wanky and forceful.  It'd be one thing if \"hey I wanna play with primarily LGBT characters and unwhite things a bit\" but 'x is boring' and forcing it = ehhh.  I think the player sounds young because other LGBT people would go \"wait what?\" at this myself included.",

            "body": "It hits close at home as I heard about it too. Fortunately I never experienced anything like that yet, but it is obvious people like that admin contribute to make the LGBTQ+ moviment look something it isn't. As you say, it is all about equality of rights, not superiority of one party, \"Only Siths deal in absolutes\" so to speak, and that person if I remember correctly also was spreading lies, speaking for the moviment saying that genderswap is disrespectiful (while many IRL transgenders said that it wasn't a problem to them to find genderswapped canon characters in Roleplay), confirming the fact xe is being a supporters of dreadful ideals that LGBTQ+ doesn't actually represent.\nUnfortunately I am sure xe isn't alone to twist reality, but a thing always made me upset while reading about it:\n\nRegardless of the fact of the lies xe was spreading about LGBTQ+, xe was tampering about roleplay, something where creativity and diversity should always be welcomed, mocking heavily in ooc characters who were etherosexual or merely for being caucasians. \nXe was picturing them as if they were all boring and bad, basically considering original things that were only fitting sensitive categories. \nTo me something like that sounds very forced because shrinks down originality from something that is to me very broad (Eg: powers, backstory, attitude of the character, things that are all necessary components to an interesting story to me)\nto two/three mere boxes that are gender, appearance and sexual preference. \n\nI have nothing and never will I have something against represent all the spectrum of humanity and sexuality.\nNevertheless to me it takes more than *just* a LGBTQ+/non caucasian character and *just that* to feel engaged to a story or call it great.\nIt takes drama, it takes emotions, it takes skills. It takes more than just a \"good boy\" point that fits the sensitive box to make it work, otherwise to me it looks like one is trying to shove as many sensitive topics in their Roleplay just to appear \"open minded\" and \"innovative\".\n\nOf course then, I have at least half of my ships between characters that are LGBTQ+, and two of them are also fantasy so they are about two remotely different races so I know the drama and the excitement a good story about those topics can be if done well. But it takes more than *just* that make a compelling story.\nSorry for the long comment",

Like, if their ads said \"HP verse, LGBT+ space\" or some other variation, then I would understand that they would block all hetero-normative play because that's not the story they've created and they've outlined it. If however, there's no reference of that in their ads or in their lores and then they just kind of spring this on you, that feels like propaganda and I'd bounce. I don't think calling heterosexuality basic and boring is a good vibe, mostly because it makes LGBT+ into some type of trend or personality trait which makes it harder for homophobics to take them seriously and feeds the \"gay agenda\" conspiracy more. Being gay or trans isn't a hobby or a kink or this season's new flavour at Starbucks, but that's what they're implying by calling heterosexuals basic.   \n\n\nSo they're basically tribalist-style neo-\"feminist\" mysandrists, probably very young and haven't quite figured out that bringing more hate to an already hate-filled world isn't going to bring them equality any quicker. It's only going to make more violence by turning everything into an Us vs Them riot.

            "body": "I hate to point out the obvious, but if this is a page or server or whatever that the admin created, then they kind of get to make up whatever rules they want. Back in my earlier heydays of roleplaying, I played on MUSHes, which covered a range of themes from World of Darkness to the Chronicles of Amber to the Pern novels, to a whole host of original themes and storylines. But they were all privately owned and run by their admin (I guess a bit like Discord servers are now), so those admin could make up whatever rules they wanted. The games were their \"sandbox.\"\n\nOf course, plenty of players would get butt-hurt about the rules and go on a tear about the admins being unfair or tyrannical, but at the end of the day, it's still their game, their rules. The most you could do was leave, join another game, or start your own and make your *own* sandbox.\n\nSo in this case, if this admin wants to create a world where heterosexual relationships are almost nonexistent, well, that's their prerogative. Maybe they want to explore what a world would look like if other types of relationships reigned supreme. Maybe they're just tired of always feeling like a minority, so they flip the script in their own world. If someone wanted to create a world/game where you could *only* play people of color, for instance, then it'd be kind of foolish to come in and demand to play a white character just because you should \"be able to make up what you want.\" Well, not really -- you're coming into someone else's world and then asking them to change their rules for you. It's like the equivalent of coming into a Harry Potter-themed game and then demanding to play, I dunno, a magical pegasus from My Little Pony. That's not the theme.\n\nAs with anything you don't agree with, you can choose not to patronize that thing. Or, better yet, create your own and make up the rules *you* think are fair. Someone, somewhere, might balk at them, but it's still your world. You have the right to create what you want.",

I feel terrible thinking it but many times I see same-sex RP ads, they come off really gross or tone deaf and I can tell some are young writers, highly inexperienced and under some strange fantasy. \n\nJust my two cents. I think all sexuality should be respected but I do think in this era and even 15 years ago, some RPers are more into taboo than characters dealing with their identity and plot beyond their sexual identity if that makes sense?",

            "body": "Hmm. This is kind of a touchy subject. I can understand that person\u2019s perspective, and I can completely empathize with it. I remember a point when I used to be that way myself.\n\nIt\u2019s not as *big* of a problem lately with lots of LGBT positive media coming out, but I remember when I was growing up as a kid in the nineties, there was literally ZERO gay representation ANYWHERE that wasn\u2019t either a shitty punchline to a bad joke, or a villain (y\u2019all remember Ursula and Scar from Disney? Because I sure do), or just making a mockery of it. Oh, you want trans representation? Here\u2019s a man in a dress trying to fool a straight guy into sleeping with him. Oh, you meant decent trans representation? How about Boys Don\u2019t\u2019 Cry (1997)? Oh, you want some trans representation where the main character doesn\u2019t get raped and/or murdered? Go fuck yourself then. \n\nThe first actual BIG LGBT piece of media I can remember was Brokeback Mountain in 2005. It won academy awards. And it still had a tragic ending. Because media used to teach queer people from a young age that if you were queer, you don\u2019t get a happy ending.\n\nAnd I mean, it\u2019s not like we live in some whole new world where LGBT content is even that *common*. The default is still heterosexuality in most media. You see it everywhere. It\u2019s literally unavoidable. \n\nI\u2019m mentioning all of this because, when you grow up in that sort of environment, you gain a sort of resentment for the status quo. And depending on how bad a person has been *personally hurt* by these things, they may be fine, or they may decide that in situations where they have control, such as your RP server, they may decide that they\u2019re going to flip the script and decide that they\u2019ll do to heterosexual content exactly what they\u2019ve seen going on with queer content their entire life. \n\nAnd that\u2019s their right. There are literally millions of RP servers out there. If you don\u2019t like how one is being run, you are free to leave and find another. Or make your own. That\u2019s an option too.\n\nMyself? I don\u2019t typically do any pairing that\u2019s not gay, and it\u2019s uncommon for me to not play some sort of gender divergent character. Because I\u2019m gonna be honest; 99.999999 repeating percent of heterosexual romance bores the shit out of me. I don\u2019t want to waste my time writing something that I can just turn on the television or open the nearest book or go to the movies and find an exact facsimile of.\n\nAlso damn, I\u2019m not trying to be inflammatory but most of the comments here sound like the people who go to a pride parade and then say \u2018but what about straight pride :(\u2019. This is *by no definition* discrimination. You wanna hear about discrimination, how about we take a look at [the list of states with no legal protections for LGBT people](https://www.freedomforallamericans.org/states/). Or for those of us worldwide, [here\u2019s a nifty list of all the countries where it\u2019s illegal to be gay; in some cases it earns you the death penalty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory). \n\nSomeone who runs an RP server the way that they want to is not in any way discrimination. It may hurt your feelings and make you feel bad, which sucks, but what sucks even worse is applying a label for a societal problem that really hurts and kills real people in real life to someone running an RP group in a way that upsets you. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not fetishization either. I\u2019m not saying that doesn\u2019t exist, but it\u2019s really disingenuous to think that an *enormous* chunk of the people in the RP community who play this content are not some manner of LGBT. I\u2019ve been roleplaying this content for fifteen years, and I can count *on one hand* the number of people who I\u2019ve done a gay RP with who are completely cishet. And of those, most of them realized they were gay/bi/pan or trans or *both* years later. Almost everyone who one might say was a cishet girl fetishizing gay men who *I\u2019ve personally known* has eventually turned out to be a lesbian or a gay trans man who did not come to terms with that until later, and exploring these things in a safe environment in fiction was what helped them realize that.",
