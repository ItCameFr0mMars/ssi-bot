It is amazing when you get sheets with characters that know 7378383833 magic spells or that can't be killed even when you chop their heads off or something. \nIt is also amazing when people decide to do op things that are not mentioned in the character sheets because they think they can do whatever they want. \n\nI don't understand the meaning of the second one though, I am not sure what a powerplayer is specifically. Do you mind explaining that to me?",

            "body": "The first one is only the child of diffidence lol.\n\nAny character regardless are potentially OP when you don't know the person behind it so you got to thread always carefully and ask thousands questions to be slightly calm lol\n\nThe second one is what I see a lot of times now, it's the guy that thinks the rp is about xir solving problems left and right, as if Roleplay was a videogame and any other character is an npc. So it happens this guy charges the RP straight on alone, \"Kirito style\" so to speak as a lone wolf which has only xir sword/firsts as friend *insert edgyness here*\n\nThey have the irrefrenable desire to be the hero of the story and they try to achieve the most insane combo of benefits to do so.\n\nThey have usually immense powers that can one up anything that comes at them. You create a villain that harms souls? Xe is soulless.\nThat lives underwater? Xir distant relative was a fish.\nIs your game setted in the star treck universe? Xe is the secret child of Darth Vather.\n\nThey most stick for fight RP and they want to assault anything that comes in their way in the OP-est way imaginable or possible\n\nKill the bad guy, kill the guy that killed their father, kill the main villain that wants to save the world. \nNo matter how many hints you can give these people that your plot may want them to do things to weaken the bad guy, they'll charge head on the villain base/castle because they... Can and they'll try to take the bad guy out. Of course metaing the hell out of it, autohitting and autododging, pulling out gizmos and powers no one ever mentioned in their approval sheet.\nUsually the encounter with the big evil guy ends up of course with the death of the power player character by the admin side, but it can happen that the powerplayer will submit another character which is the lost brother of the dead guy that is the carbon copy of the previous character. Or has *casual* attributes that the bad guy is weakened by. Because it is totally casual.\n\nThat comes to the image again. The other roleplayer in the mind of a Powerplayer, has to sit tight, as the hero saves the day because xe is the hero. Or they may be useful... Probably to make a spiritual bomb the Powercharacter is lifting to kill the bad guy, or cheer the character up if xe is losing. Or merely as an harem. Because of course the power player is not only super strong, but also super irresistible and girls and guys alike fall down for xir.",

            "body": "I don't prefer fighting in roleplays because I personally have a hard time with moves and stuff like that. (imm good girl) But when I roleplay with someone random its always gotta be fighting. I tell them that my characters don't do that sort of thing. I try doing slice and life sorta things. I hate when I try to do a fight scene and it just gets shut down. I'm a people pleaser, and I give in to people a lot so I role with it. Personally, thats not my cup of tea. I like a role play where its a guy and a girl, a couple maybe, some friends, in highschool. You know? Just something nice and simple to please me. I also like animal stuff and magic. I have a hard time with the fighting scenes in magic related roleplays. Though, those are ones I much enjoy rather than punching or stabbing someone. I'm also a slowtyper becausd I like my grammar and sentences correct. lol sometimes",
