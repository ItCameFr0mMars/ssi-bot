Is this a nsfw Rp discord?  What were the restrictions proposed for womens' comments?\n\nSpeaking for myself as A Girl... yeah, there's a way dudes vs girls post porn that feels very \"yep here's the common microaggressiony porn tropes again\" but I don't speak up because a) how do you even begin to address that in a nsfw discord?  What would a practical outcome even be or look like? b) have you *seen* how guys respond to their porn habits being put under a critical lens, in a nsfw space no less?  It's a mess.

In one word, segregation. Funnnn\n\nB... As a guy I don't know. I just think that is mispropriate to shame someone for liking something because xe is from the \"wrong\" birth origins.\nI haven't said a thing, apart expressing the admin that the whole suggestion was impossible to start up without stepping over private information, and also asking that since I had lesbian ships going around the roleplay if I had to stop roleplaying them because of my sex.",

I don't think they're asking you to abandon your ships or not roleplay them but there's definitely a difference in how guys will consume porn of wlw vs how girls will do that, it takes being very critical of your steps as an outsider to do so without issue and most people going \"mgmggnmngh girls hot\" just aren't willing to do that kind of work.\n\nIt's not 'you cant liek this, ever' but \"there is going to be misteps when consuming that content and people in the group on the receiving end will be tired of seeing the mistakes on loop in their pretendyfuntiems space even if they otherwise like looking at porn\".",
