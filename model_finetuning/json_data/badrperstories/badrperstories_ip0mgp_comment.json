But I will say - intimate scenes are super hard to write, in general, just because there's only so much you can do.\n\nMy friend and I had an RP going and we had a ton of really good scenes, but I think they just happened too often and things kind of start to lose the excitement they once carried.\n\nOnce the focus shifted a little bit and there was more of a plot, and thus, more space between those intimate scenes, it started to help bolster both the intimate and the non-sexual scenes. I think that balance is important.\n\nAnd just a heads up - I've those scenes with a few girls and only one of them was really good at it and then another that was kinda good at it, then a few who were nothing to write home about. I think a lot of it just comes down to how much creative chemistry you have with someone.\n\nThat said, there are definitely some people out there who just aren't very good at it. \ud83d\ude02",

Besides, it was more in the interactions that it felt flat. His scene-setting and description were good, which was why I stuck with it so long, I guess.

A whole cast of characters, polyamorous relationships, BDSM, gay/trans characters \u2014 you name it. And there\u2019s a ton of intimate scenes thrown in, but it never gets stale or boring, because we manage to keep it fresh with good banter, interesting setups, delving into characters\u2019 psyches, and so on. My point is that it CAN be done, and it doesn\u2019t have to lose the excitement.

            "body": "Oh, I've had a nightmare scenario not too dissimilar not too long ago. Reply to an nsfw rp post because I like the theme, we set it up, and then... nothing. The scene is like, massively tame, and they wanted it to be a slow burn, so I figure, eh, probably wanting to build it up. But it doesn't. There was supposed to be play with my character's smell being addictive and transformative, but every time I'd remind them the smell is there, they had their character brush it off. I then confronted them OoC about how the story felt like it wasn't progressing, and how because of the nature of the characters, it's be more logical for them to get nsfw stuff started. And yet, nothing. Again, nothing. Dragging their feet, even when I go OUT OF MY WAY to give them opportunities to get that started, they ignore it. The day after the confrontation, I explain the progress isn't happening again, and they say they can't find a way to do it, because they're so into this hurt, abused, malnourished character that's so goddamn shy they can't talk without a stutter that they won't initiate things. So, ooc I literally explain \"do not brush off the smell, have them ask about it.\" Here's how the idea played out in my head, to demonstrate how absolutely dumbfounded I was when you compare to the interaction that happened. \n\nIn my head: \"what's that smell?\"\n\n\"Um... me... do you like it?\" \n\n\"Kinda... what is it exactly?\" Boom, lewd shit starts. \n\nHere's how it actually went.\n\n\"What's that smell?\"\n\n\"Uh... me... do you like it?\"\n\n\"It's just strange, don't worry about it.\"\n\nI was about to literally scream. Sadly, dense people like these exist, but the best we can do is explain the mistakes they're making and hope they aren't repeated.",

            "body": "Hello here I would like to ask your advice over some \"ERP manouvers\" so to speak as you seem pretty talented and I enjoyed to read your post as I took advice already from it and the comments you left.\n\nI was never told my ERP sucks, I practice it for some while now (2 y) as some sidetrack of RP. Basically when two character in some server fall in love the ERP can happen after a while, but I never let's say specialised over its genre more than needed. To be fair I mostly worked over the GameMaster part of the server as I wanted to create nice social events and adventures over being the master of hot DMs.\n\nNevertheless when it comes to the deal I find myself quite at ease if it is with a person I know and I could technically write over +9 lines of mobile discord at post, but I feel it may just be pointless to let my partner await such large amounts of time over something that mostly would be technicalities of the action.\n\nBefore I read your post I was trying to use different characters to do different things in ERP, as they have different preferences and so does their partners, and also mostly focusing on the naturality of the deed, as some of my characters at times may mess up or do things unwilling like, miss the spot they wanted to kiss, causing all natural errors that happens naturally even in IRL... Plus new kinky stuff a character likes. Any time the sex is different as there is a particular couple that experiments a lot. But I fear my RP was growing stale despite all that, and was treated as something as not enjoyable as adventures, roleplay romance buildup full of twists, etc. Those erp that once were made in one shots between me and my partner(basically in the past we focused only over the ERP for one night/afternoon) seems that they are prolonging forever in days (ngl that is also put fault as we have 3 rp servers open already ) so I think we miss the actual spark to let that happen and eventually some post contraddit themselves, at times we lack of replies over that particular ERP... Stuff like that. I fear that our ERP is starting to become... Less sexy than it should and regarded as meh. I got to point out, I love my partner and I think we are doing great, I just think we got to restore the sexiness to it's right spot. Do you have any advice over our situation?\n\nYou instead say a great thing that may help. Do the banter, play the character. \nTo make things more clear, you think it is better to have the action of that character reflect the character itself, comparing it on how this particular person acts outside the bedroom instead of give priority of how a character is merely wrestling the partner?\n\nAnd also, do you think it would advisable to like... Speak a lot? And in what occasion you think that is most advisable?\n In sex scenes most people stay quiet because obvious matters (lips are busy) but I know the power of a good compliment, a sadistic menace,  the begging (ahh, the begging)... \nI want to implement more and more of them, but I am unsure if a scene would build up benefitting from it or just water down into the research of the meaning of life as the two start discussing instead of moving on too (I'm joking of course but I hope you get the idea).\n\nI thank you in advance for an eventual reply and the pleasant read, I wish I can become a good writer of ERP like you obviously are.\n\nAnd thank you for promoting the foreplay as foreplay is magic.\nAs aftercare is.",

Me and my partner with our characters have tried various postions, BDSM so quite a bit of stuff but I still feel I could do better, try new things, I just don't know what. I also think I am becoming bad at the talking, which i totally praise during sex, especially the begging.\n\nI also feel that I should write more during sex scenes: add more lines, use new and more words, be more detailed... Sometimes my lines are too short and I know that it's a danger too since it could kill the mood and stuff. This mostly happens when I run out of topics and I don't know what to write anymore. An example is when my character is not on top and so it gets more difficult to reply to my partner since I think the character on top does more stuff, like kissing, touching and such... \n\nI really want to be able to create a better atmosphere, since I want my characters to have a beautiful moment with my partner's characters, who I really feel sorry for because xe has to read my pitiful replies...

            "body": "Well, thank you. I don't know that I know a *lot* about ERP; I just know what I enjoy, and try to focus on what my partner enjoys as well so the play can be mutually rewarding. But here are a few tips I would offer:\n\n&gt;I also feel that I should write more during sex scenes: add more lines, use new and more words, be more detailed... Sometimes my lines are too short  \n\nWell, a thesaurus is always handy for \"using new words.\" But personally I wouldn't worry too much if your lines are too short. Sometimes less is more, and sometimes keeping the action moving along can be helpful. I think there's a tendency to \"pad\" one's post with fluff (whether in ERP or not), and personally I find it daunting when confronted with a wall of text, trying to wade through it and figure out what my character should react to.\n\nHowever, if you *are* just looking for other ways to describe the experience, I'm going to reference a post I found on writing erotica. It's more for publishing erotica shorts, but the rules still apply. In particular, I find the encouragement to engage the senses helpful. There's more going on than just sight &amp; touch: smell, taste, hearing. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticauthors/comments/fcxczr/you\\_pick\\_the\\_niche\\_lesson\\_8\\_writing\\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticauthors/comments/fcxczr/you_pick_the_niche_lesson_8_writing_techniques/)\n\nAlso, what your character is thinking/feeling about it can be helpful. Even though the sex act involves the usual, well, *acts*, it's still particular to the people involved. How do they feel about it? Have they done it before? Are they skilled/experienced or not? Are they learning as they go? Is it something new/different they're trying out (like the BDSM you mentioned), and if so, how does *that* make them feel? The scene is happening through their eyes, filtered through their emotions, so let us (the reader/partner) feel that vicariously.\n\n&gt;  I think the character on top does more stuff, like kissing, touching and such... \n\nYour character can still do all that stuff on the bottom. ;) Or just change up the positions. There are many to choose from!\n\nAlso, just in general, *talk to your partner* and figure out what they like/enjoy, what they want to focus on, etc. Sometimes we play guessing games because we don't think to just ask. So... ask. \n\nHope some of that helps! Good luck!",
