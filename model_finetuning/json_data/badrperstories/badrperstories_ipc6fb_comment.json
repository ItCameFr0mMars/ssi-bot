Coming here to reddit to find more people to write with was kind of a shock in terms of how demanding some of the ads in those communities are. I've found some delightful partners that I qualified for, but the culture shock was still there. \n\nThe hardest one for me to wrap my head around has been the insistence some have on the other writer's gender. That has never mattered to me before. I don't even KNOW who may be on the other side of the screen for many people that I write with. Ads that demand an opposite gendered writer from the poster are the weirdest to me, since it's almost always for romance lines. It really makes me worry about a lack of IC/OOC divide there.",

I definitely have a bias against writing with other men, but it isn't a hard limit, I am just much warier about giving it a go.\n\nFundamentally, I just need to see some amount of effort and honesty from the other party, and there is no way to 'filter out' low-effort or uninterested (or uninteresting) partners without just talking to them about what we both want, and maybe giving a scene a go. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work - but trying to find a 'perfect' partner based on a series of criteria without just trying to write with people seems like a fool's errand.\n\nThere are behavioural warning signs for me that may or may not warrant being red flags - Text shorthand, appearing offline in discord while talking to me, established characters that they have curated over years with multiple page descriptions and 'faceclaims', and fixations on defining themselves or their characters as 'dominant or submissive' regardless of how much or how little of a 'smut' framing the story is supposed to have. Again, not red flags, just things that make me pause and consider more carefully.\n\nWhen I read a post that has a billion criteria, especially an insistence on how advanced they are, how advanced they want their partner to be, and how many writing samples or similar they want, I am immediately put off even though I could probably tick all the boxes - it is asking me (or any other potential respondent) to put in substantial time and effort to *maybe* warrant a response from them, and there is no way to know if I would 'click' with the other party. It is starting the 'relationship' out in an entirely one-sided manner, where one party's time is seen as incredibly valuable, and the other needs to 'earn' any second of it, rather than looking for a partnership.",

No, I don\u2019t endorse trolling, but the OP was looking for a fight by playing with a clear troll.\n\nThe comment thread spiralled out of control and one of the mods stepped in.

            "body": "I have no qualms with being picky in my ads, since in my mind, posting an ad is sort of like rubbing a genie's lamp and making your wish -- sometimes you have to be *very* specific with the wording or you never know what you might get!\n\nSo for instance, I might specify the medium I prefer for writing (GoogleDocs) since the vast majority seem to favor Discord, but I can't really use that beyond OOC chatting as it's blocked at work (I work the night shift, and on slow nights, when I'm lucky, I like to write to while away the hours!) Sometimes you just need to put your limitations/preferences right out there so you can weed out incompatibilities.\n\nAs far as gender-preference behind the screen, I know that a lot of women tend to prefer to write with other women. Myself included, although it's not a hard-and-fast rule. But I just usually vibe better with female partners. Lots of women unfortunately end up with horror stories about dudes who crossed the line; one partner of mine was stalked in the past by a player who couldn't seem to separate his feelings from his character's. It just got messy. I've been lucky, myself, and my worst horror stories are just that the erotic parts of the RP are kinda underwhelming, maybe because men and women tend to focus on different things.\n\nI'm also one of those who will ask for a writing sample, because I think it saves time. I basically just want to make sure that I'll enjoy *reading* whatever my partner spews at me. And it goes beyond mere spelling and grammar -- while I want it to be legible, I can still overlook the occasional typos if the writing itself is engaging. Do I want to read more? Does their writing have a good flow? Is this something I will want to respond to over and over? I want writers who will inspire and challenge me, not leave me bored.\n\nHonestly, the ad should act like a bit of a filter, and weed out partners who might not be suitable for whatever reason. \n\nThen the second stage, once you get to chatting/brainstorming, is where the chemistry comes in -- how well you \"click\" with someone. If it feels like pulling teeth just to get some plot or character ideas out of them, or if I have to ask all the questions and make all the suggestions, that's a warning sign. I need someone who will share that load equally and bring their own ideas to the table. What I love best is when we can riff off one another's ideas, and use the \"Yes, and\" improv approach to plotting and brainstorming. If all of that flows seamlessly, there's a much better chance our RP will flow seamlessly.\n\nBut, y'know, everyone has their own way of doing things. I tend to be very picky in general (it'll take me an hour of browsing through Netflix to settle on a show to watch!) so it stands to reason I'll be picky in RP as well. That can also mean I might end up with fewer partners and not get to write as much, but I'd still rather have quality over quantity.",

People who only want do one plot or very few select pairings in one obscure fandom. People who have plots ready-to-go but they already have a fully built universe where there's no 'room' for a potential partner. People who go on and on about literacy requirements for their partner. People who specify their partner's gender and/or sexual orientation.\n\nThe one that makes me groan the most are people who specify their partner's character type, personality *and* on top that they have a list of preferred face claims they want you to use.

Even when I do get messages they often don't want what I want or offer completely different plots, which would be fine normally.   \n\n\nI understand at that point I'm just not going to get a lot of responses because of my weird niche original idea but I figure it's a numbers game and eventually someone will see it and decide to roll the dice on me.

So, on a discord server where there\u2019s fairly restrictive character limits to a post, you\u2019d try to keep that part brief. On Reddit, I\u2019d imagine you can go into detail a bit more.\n\nI\u2019m old and still use forums, so it\u2019s not uncommon to find very lengthy ad posts with longer rule explanations. That\u2019s what I tend to do, as well, but then again, I like making my advertisements fun to read. Maybe I\u2019m unique in this, but most of my deciding if a partner will be fun to play with is done before I even contact them; depending on how their ad reads, I might not message a person I otherwise would. \n\nI\u2019ve got, eh, 5-10 rules I\u2019ll typically put into a thread. Most of them are standard things, and they\u2019re not rules so much as guidelines, regarding post length, spell checking, etc. If I run into the same problem in quick succession, I\u2019ll add a new rule to reflect that. I distinctly remember having \u2018I am not your emotional punching bag and will not be treated as such\u2019 or something of that nature after I met a few partners in quick succession who launched immediately into telling me their intimate, personal problems before the RP had even started. Woof. I don\u2019t have time for that.",
