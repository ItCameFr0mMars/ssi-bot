But, like I said, it sounds like your posts are working and you're getting responses, if not maybe the ones you wanted.\n\nHave you tried answering more ads, yourself? I actually tend to have better luck that way, surprisingly. When I post an ad, I get my hopes up, but it's usually not quite what I'm looking for, whereas when I answer an ad, I can really hone in on the elements they wrote about that interest me. I think all my most successful roleplays have come about from me answering someone else's ads rather than posting my own. Give it a shot, and good luck!",

Once you dig through the low hanging fruit you'll eventually find at least one partner you click with.\n\nThat said, I agree with the person above. I've had more luck finding compatible partners from being patient and answering ads than posting them. I've posted ads a couple times and have been met with nothing but frustration, since people... um... kind of miss the point of the ad. I've read a lot of ads and from them I have a pretty good if me and a potential partner will mesh. No guarantees, of course, but a much better success rate than by posting ads.\n\nGood luck with your search! Have a great day/evening/night!",
