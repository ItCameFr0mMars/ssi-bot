I have seen many players who write one line very often, even people who write multiple messages instead of writing everything in one message, for example: \nMessage 1: \"Hello\"\nMessage 2: \"Nice to meet you\"\nMessage 3: *smiles* \n\nI hate when this happens, because I have no clue when the players finishes to write xir message, so it can happen then I write a reply when they are actually still writing their reply. \n\nOne lining though can depend on players' experience  and also on the type of conversation, like it is difficult to write a paragraph on sentences like, I don't know, \"Can you pass me the salt?\" *Xe asks politely*. That is short, but it is something I can work with. When the topic is something deep or a fight between characters, then I try to write more and would appreciate a longer reply from my partner as well, since I have seen people who are like *I attempt to do this and so on* and their reply was *dodges*. \n\nSo I totally get your frustration when I read that you wrote something long and something deep and their reply was short. Like I said, if the reply is something I can work with then it's fine, because the player might have just started to roleplay so xe needs time to learn everything and then improve, I used to write very short replies too, but how can I work with a reply like *blushes* \"thank you\"? I mean... what else? Do you see me as a friend only? Do you accept my feelings and want to be my boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you need time to think about it? \n\nI understand that sometimes it can be difficult to answer to very long paragraphs, to express oneselves, but at least give a complete answer, because in that \"thank you\" there are things that are missing in my opinion.",
