            "body": "I'm... Slightly guilty of one of the things you describe and I'm trying to work over resolve this problems. I mean I do not consider by far anymore a bad writer even if I completely mess up a scene or end up being a fool due to an embarrassing situation, I mostly now suck on that and try to better myself.  \nMy problem comes when I mostly manipulate other people which it happened already at least three times due to... I guess I can consider big issues.   \nYou see I mostly act as moderator or admin in some places, and I usually am a very methodical, active person around the community to the point some people may think I have no better thing to do.   \nI'm mostly the one that proposes rules regarding an issue or otherwise the first one to give feedback over characters and proposals.   \nIf a fight is about to go down I am usually there trying to attempt to tell what the rules states what.   \nDo not get me wrong, I attempt to be as flexible as possible when it comes to reasoning with someone else as I firmly believe the virtue is in the middle of two opposing parties.  \nI can't stand that much the feeling of being idle and letting a problem grow. Let's say that ignore things that bother me isn't my strong suit, mostly because I've seen a couple of servers crumble due to that.    \nSo it can happen there are some divergences, and if I clearly see that some people are trying to do something very stupid, like allow some already well-known party crasher inside our roleplay group,  propose a rule that will be absurdly complicated and cryptic and that will cause our server to crash over the amount of reviews of all the sheets we would have to redo, you will have to consider the fact I won't be up to reasoning for much, I mean, I will try to tell my opinion about the matter but when the other person from the other side isn't even open to address the points I made, I may get dangerously out of hand, and leaving the server I am in/banning the heck out of the person that is causing a problem may be a possibility that can cross my mind (and I have used to prevent things from happening), as I cannot stand quietly in a room discussing something that potentially may hurt the server as whole or causing havoc among my players.  \nI am sure some people at this point may think I am not open to critiques which I don't know what to reply honestly because when it comes to myself I am very open to be judged and discuss about it, but when I see something really dumb in the distance and my interlocutor fails to comply to my concerns, I'm mostly the first one to raise a red flag.   \nIt's stronger than me actually, I cannot help it. Especially because in the end, I was right.   \n\n\nThere was this person that was well known to be there just for cause drama around, the second I've seen xe had a bad behavior (and we all well knew xir records as xe was a previous member that had already caused problems) I slapped xir account out of the server with a ban, without many ceremonies.   \nAs I broke the rule of following these particular ceremonies (I was meant to call this person out, then warn then mute and then kick, and then again if xe came back again xe would have been banned, basically giving this person a free pass of doing the hell xe wanted three times), I was removed from a position I could actually moderate members, which is fine I guess at some point as I decided that myself over this person's records and my judgment only. \n\nUnless the fact a week later this person returned and set the chat on fire over an argument. I didn't take part of the argument just calmly sipped my tea and DMd the Admin telling xir \"I told you so\".   \n(End of the story the drama person left by xirself so it is most likely possible xe'll return again, but I guess xe'll never get the chance of RP as xe is uncapable of sustain a normal conversation ooc, let alone pass an approval and I am in there just for RP at this point)\n\nI would be curious to hear your opinions, am I or am I not a crybaby too? Do you think I exert too much power over the server I am in (which I admit, I kinda fear I am doing)?   \nThank you in advance",

            "body": "  The problem you need to think about it is, and this is something that will obviously affect my judgement if you are a 'crybaby' or not: how likely is it that this problem player or a ominous rule will cause the problems you say will happen? Or do you overexaggerate stuff in order to get what you want?  \n\nIt is totally okay to point out problems with the rp or certain writers. That is even good and healthy for the rp.   But there is huge difference between 'I heard that this writer has harassed other writers in the past/ calls people slurs/ is known to crash rps. Maybe we should not accept them.' or    'You have to delete writer XY because five years ago I started a 1x1 rp with them and they said they are not really interested in the roleplay after a few replies, so obviously they will start a huge drama that will lead to the downfall of the rp. And if you don't do it immediately, I will delete the whole server/self harm'.\n\n Of course, this is super exaggerated. But the manipulation part is the most important.    If you don't like the direction a server is going, it is fine to leave. It is okay to say 'Well, this rp does not suit me anymore after the rules have changed, so I will leave.' It is also okay to ban people as a moderator if they are not open for a discussion and instead refuse to consider your arguments multiple times.\n\n What makes someone a 'crybaby' in my opinion is reacting this strongly to something that easily could be a misunderstanding.    For example, if not reading your arguments and instead questioning the rules again and again is pattern of behavior, it is okay to say 'well, I am done here, no need to waste my energy on this person anymore'. \n\nBut it would be over the top and petty to react this way when someone has asked question that could easily be based on a misunderstanding, and this person has never shown any negative behavior before. \n\n It is also not really...good to assume that always, the most worst possibly outcome will happen. Sometimes, a person comes of as a little bit rude at first, but no big drama happens and in the end, everyone will get along.\n\n Instantly banning everyone who does something you consider rude without confronting them about it first would lead to you banning a lot of people because of a misunderstanding. For example, many people assume a good friend of mine is trying to be passive aggressive, but she is just very straightforward and there is never a hidden negative meaning with the stuff she writes ooc.\n\n Sometimes, people change a rule and later realise 'Whelp, this did not work out as planned, let's make a new rule and delete this one' and no greater damage was done. If people tend to overexaggerate these issues and the problem they will most likely cause, it will end with the other writers not taking them seriously anymore. \n\n It also causes members to kind of...fear you if your reaction seems disproportionate to the 'crime' that was committed. I have written with people who had this issue and one wrongly chosen word could lead to them wanting to have you banned from the servers, and many other writers did not want to interact with them, because a little mistake in wording could lead to huge accusations and them hating you forever.  \n\nAnd of course, there are always instances were your instinct was right and a person did indeed cause drama. But on the other hand, you will never know how many times you would have been wrong about banning someone. So it is always the best to take a step back and ask yourself 'Is this problem really as big as I make it out to be?/Could this be a simple misunderstanding?' and so on.",

The example I made was kind of the first and last time I ever took action by my own and banned a crasher that was indeed... A crasher. Usually I am the one that instead talks with these people and try to understand what's wrong amd such, or tries to mediate. My role was in fact to apply the rules how they are written and make sure peace is mantained.\n\nI think in my honest opinion I do not exagerate problems that much. And of course I'd never threat of harm myself or similar shenanigans, those are bad examples and it is irrespectiful to those who have grave issues. \nI would rather not be feared, that is why I never abused my powers as admin to accomplish a personal ban, I checked out with several roleplayers I was less familiar with and explained to them the situation and the deeds i had done, and they said they understood. Let's say I have tried to be as transparent as possible in my \"crime\" so to speak.\n\nThere are some posts around this sub that speak about these issues I faced through that server (it all happened within a week or two). Of course my words may be the fakest lies in the world, but indeed an admin wanted to approve an half assed magical system that most probably would have froze the whole server in a period of reapprovals of any character for.... Solve nothing and create more issues and loopholes wothin the sistem with all certainty.\n\nThe person I banned was responsible of a whole revision of the server when it was starting, and caused several problems that were never fixed back up fully again.\nLet's just say I had to deal with this person in the past, it wasn't just \"xe didn't replied to my posts\" or \"xe was passive aggressive\". Me and other admins had proofs of that all.\n\nThe further problem of that server is that is a bit... Tiny and familiar to me. If I were to say \"ok i am going away this place is causing me stress (which to he fair the day of the argue with the admins was indeed stressful to all of us)\" the server would most likely close. Most of my character are unfortunately tied up with others (as i hope this is the right thing to do) so if i were to leave, the server would have half of their characters blocked because all mine suddenly disappeared.\n\nI wish and I hope I will never have abuse admin rights again (now i don't have them so i guess it is even simpler), and i wish i won't have to threaten to leave. As i mentioned at the start of the post I am trying to better myself and not do that again, I thank you for your time and message, i will check out more often this post for advice",

            "body": "I had a partner who was like this. Except she acted all confident and then would delete her account on the platform we roleplayed on when she felt as if she wasn't good enough. And then she'd come back a few weeks or a month later with a new account. A few times, she pretended to be someone else just to do some undercover shit when I knew it was her at the end of it all. I was done with being fucked with. If I'm one of the best partners you've ever had like you claim I am, why the fuck do you treat me like that with your childish way of expressing your insecurities? Also ignoring me out of character often is pretty low.\n\nAfter I forgave her four times, I just got rid of her. We had been roleplaying for two years just about and she would apologize, then kept on making the same mistakes over and over again. Whether it be ignoring my ideas, doing some metagaming, godmodding, and other shit that benefits her characters and factions making my characters feel like NPCs, or in other words, secondary to hers. It got annoying as fuck and I couldn't take it anymore. And she'd find some way to ruin every goddamned romance we try to get into the list of side plots as well as her characters' bonds with mine.\n\nA lot of the things she would use in every roleplay was unoriginal. A character, idea, or a faction being snatched from a fandom or something else. Some didn't even fit said fandom that we're roleplaying. I just don't understand why people like this just love writing with unoriginal ideas all of the time. I try my best to write OCs the best I can, even if it's loosely based on something else. I noticed after I played The Last of Us entirely how much she had taken from both of the games and how uncreative a lot of her ideas were. I hope to never have a partner like that again. So I feel this post.",

            "body": "1.) not everyone loves dragon slaying games\n2.) a roleplay is different from a video game. The thrill is the adrenalin rush from trying to defeat the dragon. Your roleplay search about writing an animal that decomposes after being hunted and killed...sound not very thrilling. After the death, nothing happens except you describing how your character rots. Probably as interesting for people as a roleplay where characters don't interact, and everyone just describes the clothing of their character in massive detail instead.\nCan you really not see why your roleplay search would be...boring for the other writer?",
