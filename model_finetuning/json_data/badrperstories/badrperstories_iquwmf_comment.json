I am so sorry it happened to you.\n\nAlthough I do want to say... he doesn't sound like a nice person. I understand wanting to do your own thing in a roleplay, but you told him no and he should've respected that. The fact he didn't shows a lot about him. \n\nIn terms of roleplaying, if you feel like you need some time from it, don't hesitate to take some time to yourself! However if you want to jump in, there are some communities here for roleplaying. I'm sure you'll find someone, love! Good luck!",

I lost 2 female Roleplayers who I liked a lot talking to but I didn't feel the same way. Thing is I am very talkative and eventually one way or another they start getting feelings for me. One of them pushed for Smut but as ourselves rather than Characters Which kind of made me uneasy. While the other didn't like Smut but went along for me. to this day I have no idea why she just left, maybe it was jealousy or some other reason but people need to separate Real life and Roleplay.",
