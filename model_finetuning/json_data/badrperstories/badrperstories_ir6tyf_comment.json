You mentioned that despite 'agreeing' to write against said character they didn't seem to have much input in the story itself. This is a telltale sign of someone feeling uncomfortable or disinterested in some part of the story - which in this case appears to have been your choice of OC. It could be that they were simply uncomfortable writing (romantically?) against a character they couldn't imagine themselves being attracted to. I don't think we can really blame anyone for not wanting to write a scenario they're not interested in, but best of luck in finding someone who would be interested in such!",
