To potentially lose friends - as many never came back to the website when it got restored, which took about a month. \n\nThe downside to roleplaying is that some people won't reply. You'll sometimes go for months and then they vanish. Or never get around to writing anything. It is just a part of roleplaying. You just have to learn to get past that bit. Some people however are wonderful and don't mind the waits or delays real life causes.\n\nI would recommend looking at other avenues, forums, other servers. You'll find something.",

            "body": "That definitely sounds frustrating and upsetting, and I can commiserate. It's hard to lose a whole world/storyline you've concocted with another person (or a server you were part of), but the thing is, your writing doesn't *have* to be dependent on others. Maybe having other people provide spark or momentum is a key component (I know it is for me), but you can still write on your own -- perhaps try exploring some of these unfinished stories and adding your own endings. Or using those stories as a springboard to inspire your own variations.\n\nAs far as roleplay goes, try not to get too discouraged. In my experience, *most* of them fizzle after a little while. And it's often not really anything personal -- people just get busy or distracted and keep meaning to respond, but then suddenly a week goes by and they haven't and it just becomes easier to drop the ball.\n\nI basically just got greedy and started up a bunch of roleplays to see what stuck. I do the one-on-one route, but I imagine that could work with servers, too. Just join a couple and see what most piques your interest, and/or answer a couple of ads. Another option is to just try some quick scenes -- maybe write a prompt and put it in an ad and invite folks to just respond to the  prompt so you can get something started. You can usually tell right off the bat if you'll mesh or not. Not every RP has to be the long-term dream RP we all want -- *most* of them aren't -- just like most dates fizzle out after one or two. But at least you're still writing, and none of it's ever wasted. You can add more writing and experience to your repertoire, challenge and push yourself, and maybe turn some of those half-baked ideas into your own stories.\n\nMy main point is: don't despair. If you love writing, keep at it. Partners will come and go, always, but as long as you can keep writing, you can build upon your craft. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve been role playing for a very, very long time and have encountered just about everything.  I\u2019d say about 90% of the RPs I start last less than a week (on their behalf or mine) or never fully develop past the planning stage.  It is completely normal for this hobby and in no way reflects on your skills as a writer.  Every now and then, you\u2019ll find a great partner who you click with and before you know it, your RP has gone on for longer than a year.  It is disappointing when long-term partner calls it quits, but its something you just have to accept.  Remember the good times and move forward.\n\nFinding a lasting, good RP is a numbers game.  I can\u2019t offer any advice on servers (I\u2019m a one-on-one RPer only), but I can suggest that you put yourself out there and contact as many people as possible that interest you and fit your expectations.  It gets discouraging at times, but I promise that if you stick it out, you\u2019ll find someone you jive well with.",

Usually hub servers have places where you can post ads for one on one stories.   \n\n\nI learned the hard way not to date people I write with though. It can get toxic a little too quickly, and character bleeds happen a lot, sadly.   \n\n\nWhatever route you take, I'm sorry this all happened. I hope you don't quit altogether. Best of luck!",
