            "body": "The problem with ghosting on the Rp but still talking ooc is that you want them to not know you're saying no enough so you can avoid the predictable \"but whyy :(\" response but also you simultaneously want them to understand that it's a no.  You tried dealing with an ooc issue ic (the infinity stoning) and that just doesn't work.  You also vented about Rp-related things to a guy you had down as a hard no for Rping with, which... yeah, do not do this.\n\n&gt;In a discussion on a rp resource forum, I noted that people often didn't realize they were the reason their partners left, and an ex partner of mine powerplayed yet had no idea why partners bailed. My friend attacked me for complaining about him behind his back and claimed he'd been hurt by my 'massive rant'. I pointed out that what I'd written on the forum was vague enough to be about anyone (it referred to several people besides him). I had to ask him multiple times if he was telling me what I was and wasn't allowed to post.\n\n'cause honestly yeah, you were passive-aggressive as hell here.  You knew there was a chance he could see it, that it was within recent proximity to a falling out with him, that his mutuals could see it but you try playing it off as \"oh well *technically* it could be about anyone are you trying to control what I post?\".  You don't own your actions, you pull away and you're just \"oh you can choose to leave if you want\" when called on it.\n\nIs he a bad rper and the reason his Rp partners leave?  Yep.  But this friendship should really not have continued with \"im going to not address this issue, sidestep it and assume we can still be ooc chatting buds for years with a *huge* unspoken incompatibility\".  That was not going to go away and even though he's the reason his partners left you chose not to address a block-worthy issue for years.  He thinks you're manipulative because you did some weird quiet sidestepping game instead of just upfront saying no for literal years.  Yes he should have inferred you weren't going to Rp with him but again, you didn't say no because you didn't want him to realize it was a no.  Yes he would have responded badly but dragging out a friendship/acquiantancing for two and a half years was only going to compound it.\n\nLike I've been on both sides of the ghosting thing (unwittingly because I sucked at confronting my own discomforts, avoided and then avoided the person by proxy) and the flipside to 'oh people are the reason their partners leave' is so many people don't talk it out and choose to leave except you simultaneously chose to stay so yep, guy was confused.  I would be reeling if I discovered a mutual Rp buddy that had vented to me about other Rpers was also going \"oh yeah and I have issues with you too I'll just not bring up because I've largely written you off as a person but you can be my shoulder to lean on for a lil bit!\" for two and a half *years*.\n\nAnyway.  He's in the wrong and it sounds like you've acknowledged your half, just bear it in mind for the future.",

If you'd told him two years ago, he could've improved and by now become a better person and a roleplayer. You didn't have to give him a big moral shakedown. You didn't have to guide him like a little kid. All you had to do was say 'this is what you're doing wrong, I don't like it, sorry'. Maybe it would help, maybe not- but there's a chance he would have improved from that and the world would be a slightly better place because he would've grown up a bit and become a better RPer. Taking that into account is called morality.\n\nYou didn't do that, though. You sort of strung him along for two years, rambling about RP with other people, rubbing it in his face. He honestly did a mature thing by believing you were on a break, letting you do as you please while remaining a friend of yours.\n\nYes, he's a big moron. Bad RPer. You don't have to RP with him or even associate with him. But you dun goof'd and were a massive asshole, in my book.\n\nI am intensely passionate about this because all the times when I was a bad RPer, I appreciated those people who told me off the most. The people who pussyfooted, sidestepped and 'played the nice guy', taking my feelings and emotions into account, were the ones who did damage- those people who have this perceived moral high-ground because 'they're so nice and don't hurt feelings!'.",
