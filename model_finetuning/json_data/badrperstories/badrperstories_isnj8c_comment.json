            "body": "I have had kind of the same experience as you when it comes to admins who abuse their powers. \nI was in this server with 7 admins, and only one of them did their job correctly. \n\nFirst of all, when I joined the server it looked as dead as a wasteland, nobody was roleplaying and members and admins were offline almost all day. And if they are on what happens? Nothing. Also because out of 10 people only two of them were always on. \nMy partner had joined the server as well and posted his characters, but even after a month the admins never replied. He tried to ask to check them, and they said that the server was on \"temporary freeze\" because admins were busy IRL with work and such, but that wasn't true at all, because somedays you could see them online. Streaming games on Twitch. Yep, sooo busy. \n\nBut the best part was that if you tried to speak your mind about something, whether it is for insisting on checking on your characters while months passed, or say your opinion about something that it wasn't like theirs, then they would go against you and try to shut your mouth somehow, even if you had spoken in a calm way, with the excuse \"you are disturbing the peace of the server\". When this happens almost all the admins and most of the members were on, going against you (some members and admins know each other IRL), as if they were spying on you and waiting for the moment to back each other up like an army only because you said something that wasn't their opinion. \n\nNow they can say everything they wanted because they were all friends and family, but if you tried to speak to defend your poor friend who is attacked by more than 10 people, the admins go like \"everyone else who joins the conversation will be muted\", when one of their rule stated \"you are free to express your opinion\". It was clear that they abuse their power of admin, because they would menace to mute you after you had spoken your mind about something, so they disrespect their own rules but they didn't care since they are admins and claimed that they could do whatever they wanted. \n\nEventually my partner and me got banned for speaking our minds, despite one of the rule said \"3 warnings and then you get banned\". \n\nI could write more and more about this people since there is a whole story behind it, but I wanted to tell how they were working as admins since you have written it in your post and I was like \"this is so relatable\" XD \n\nSo I apologize in advance for lacking of details or for eventual things I forgot to add, I also blame it for my bad memory.",
