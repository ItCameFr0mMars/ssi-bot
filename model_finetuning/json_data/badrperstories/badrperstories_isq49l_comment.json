Even if you think the picture looked nice, it can very well be that the owner/their other friends really thought that that this person drew the owner in an unflattering way to be mean. Or that it triggered their insecurities, and the owner was like 'This is how people imagine me?'\n\nWith stuff like that, it is better to ask first. A lot of people would not be very happy to know what other people imagine them to look like. There are a lot of ways to go wrong with this.\n\nIt does not excuse being super mean to the girl, as the people there should have realized that it was meant as nice gesture, even if it was not well-received.",

It was just a girl doing what she does best to try and garner attention from toxic people. It was very upsetting to watch :(",

Unfortunately, people like that like to portray themselves as the victim to excuse their bullying.\n\nI once was in a server like that as well. The main leaders often started fights with other members over nothing, or bullied them (making fun of someone for being transgender, for example), but because they always supported each other, they were able to delude themselves (and often new members who did not about the situations except from their stories) into thinking that they were the good guys.\nIt took a while for me to notice something was off, and when I realized it, suddenly some former situations made more... sense to me. Before, I only thought 'Oh, these poor guys, always attracting the wrong people'",
