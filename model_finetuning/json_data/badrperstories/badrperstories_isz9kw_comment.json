He describes certain aspects of his character as being unchangeable, saying that no matter what he'll always be these things and basically expressing that he has no interest in character growth or development. \n\nI genuinely like both him and his character. I want him to have fun. I just wish I could get him to understand that because it's a *group* game, I have to think about the *group* and can't just break all our lore so he can do a random thing that's fun, sure, but irrelevant to the actual story. He's been getting frustrated because \"not enough people are talking\" about his character, so he thinks *we're* stifling his ability to let his character be known. What we actually see happening is that the entire server is aware of exactly who the character is, but they're not engaging because they're not actually interested. It's at a point where if the staff isn't setting up scenes to play our characters with him, we have to bribe others in DMs. \n\nI know that if I just black-and-white approach this, he's not a good fit. It happens. What bothers me is that he has internalized that and made it into a Me vs Him thing where he feels like he can't talk to me.

We didn't know by his bio or application that his intention was to make a character that was just everyone's friend, no political views whatsoever, never involved in a single arc because he refuses to be associated with anyone violent. \n\nI know he *feels* I'm being unfair, but all I've ever done is show him the parts of the written lore that show why his ideas aren't physically possible. I'm not writing new things to block him. This is stuff he said he read when he applied. \n\nThat said, at the very least, I agree that I do need to talk to him about all of this.
