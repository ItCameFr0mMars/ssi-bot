On the other hand, many smut roleplayers are totally harmless.\n\nI personally don't write smut roleplays, I don't enjoy them at all. You definitely don't have to write them. But some people just enjoy writing sex scenes, and that is their preference. As long as every person involved agrees to it (and their is no pedophilic stuff involved), it is fine by me.\n\nLike, of course sex does not add much to the story. But I guess that is also not the reason why many people want to include it. They just like writing sex scenes.\n\nNo matter how much you try to rationalize why you don't write porn (which is totally fine, I understand), this will never convince anyone who likes writing it to stop.

No one is ever obligated to write smut at all, and changing one's mind is totally fine, but some people mislead others about being okay with/wanting smut scenes when they knew all along that it wasn't something they were comfortable with. Then later if the other person is upset or pulls out of the roleplay they get painted in a negative light and told that they \"just want to write porn.\" (Not saying OP mislead others in this way, but I've seen it happen.)\n\nThere's nothing wrong with enjoying (or not enjoying) smut in your roleplay, people just need to be honest and forthright about it from the start, really, and then it's important to respect the other person's desires and not disparage them just because your preferences don't align.",

It is *okay* for smut to be a requirement for *some people*, just as it is *okay* for no-smut to be a requirement for you.\n\nIf smut is a dealbreaker for you (or for them, but they aren't here for us to talk to) then it's something you need to bring up earlier. You also should respect peoples' choices and recognize that they are valid. You can't force someone to roleplay with you, and if they want to have a smut element in their roleplay plots then there is nothing wrong with that at all, and it is honestly really shitty of you to frame them as \"just wanting to write porn.\"\n\nThe person you had that experience with sounds mean and it sucks that you had a bad experience there, but many people would have a lack of any smut possibility as a dealbreaker for a longterm romance roleplay, and it doesn't mean that they \"just want to write porn.\" People are allowed to have preferences, and there are people for nearly every niche that you can find. Non-smut roleplayers aren't that rare to find, so you should make sure when you start a new roleplay with a new person that you're on the same page there. You aren't entitled to a certain person as your writing partner just because you want it to be so. They are allowed to have their own preferences just as you do.\n\nAs for the thoughts on writing smut with strangers and how it applies to me personally, that's not something I generally do. Usually by the time smut comes up in any roleplay I've become friends with that person and we've written together and talked ooc quite a lot. I do think though that a well done sex scene can be just as important to a pair's development and story as other types of scenes. Smut scenes don't need to be porn fodder, there's dynamics there, there can be humor, plot elements can happen *in* the scene, banter and bonding can happen. There can be something that goes wrong, there could be an interruption, there could be emotional revelations, all sorts of things. It's literally the same as any other roleplay scene, or can be. Obviously some people are just out to write some no-plot porn, but I feel that's outside of the plot-heavy roleplay that is being referred to here.",

Okay, valid, but not really something to build a relationship on. I would walk just because they made such a big deal out of it early on, ya know?\n\nI've had writing partners who I've told way in advance \"I don't write smut. I will fade to black if it comes up.\" And then it came down to the smut, and they'd make me feel pressured to write it, which left me feeling really uncomfortable and I didn't want to write with them anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, I've written with people who were absolutely against anything even like smut, like the sexy tension builds that promote intimacy, and that's left me disappointed to the point that I didn't want to write with them either.\n\nI think you're partially right. If you're clear about your wants for RP and they go against that later on - that's their bad. But if you approach someone else and say \"I like your story, I want to write with you, I just won't write smut\" when they're looking for a story that has smut involved, then it's not wrong for them to say no. In the same way that you're welcome to not write with people who want smut, they're welcome to not want to write with someone that won't write smut with them.\n\nEssentially, your opinion boils down to only your preferences mattering, which isn't okay. If someone is looking for smut and you won't write it, it's absolutely okay for them to say \"this is what I'm looking for, you won't give me that, so I'm not going to role play with you.\" Your desires are valid, but so are theirs.",

            "body": "&gt; roleplay with a total stranger that could be a creep behind a keyboard \n\nI *do not* give a *single iota* of a shit. I don't know them IRL. The only thing I care about literally at all is if my partner is of legal age to roleplay the content we're roleplaying. Why does it matter at all? What is the preoccupation with what someone is like in real life if you're gonna RP with them? I've been roleplaying for 15+ years. Had hundreds, maybe thousands, of partners. You wanna know how many times I've encountered a person who I was geographically close enough to that it might be feasible that we had even been in the same building before? *Once.* I'm never going to meet these people IRL. I'm probably never even going to get to know them on a personal level, just statistically speaking. Why does it matter?\n\nI remember once, someone responded to an ad I had made, and asked me specifically if I was a dude IRL, because they didn't play with girls, who they said were all shitty roleplayers. I told them I was, and then when they said 'oh good we can roleplay', I denied them and called them out on it. They threw a huge baby tantrum and then allegedly 'quit roleplaying'. Lol, good.\n\n&gt; some roleplayers don't suit me, whether it's **their grammar level**, their  **level of description**, and the **ability to keep me hooked by contributing  to the plot** \n\nWell in my opinion those things should never be a requirement to play with someone! /s\n\nAll right, now onto my serious response.\n\nSmut is a requirement to roleplay with *me.* Just the same as 'write well', 'use a spellcheck', 'if you begin to tell me about all of the problems you have with other people and how terrible your life is within a week of meeting I'm gonna dip', 'original RP only-- no fandoms', and 'I hate slice of life bullshit' are the requirements that I set to play with me. \n\nI am allowed to have these preferences. As far as I know, I get one (1) life on this spinning rock, and I'm not going to sink time and effort that I could use for literally anything else I enjoy into a roleplay that I know I won't like as much as I *could*. Why would I? Being able to write really well is... Not exactly rare. I've met many, many people who can write well-- beautifully, in fact. Many who can worldbuild with the best of them and come up with fabulous plots. Some of them do sex scenes. Some of them don't. Since I don't have infinite time to play with everyone, guess which ones I'll choose to roleplay with?\n\nBy all means you're allowed to be uncomfortable with the idea of sexual roleplay! That's fine! Go ahead and put that upfront in your threads! You'll find partners, still, probably. But you'll also probably turn people off. Why is it perfectly fine to want to *not* have smut as a preference, but *asking for smut* is wrong?\n\nI'm gonna be real with you-- you sound really, really elitist here. It's likely unintentional, but the way I'm reading your post it definitely comes across like you think you have some moral high ground over all of the sick, depraved perverts out there who just roleplay smut with people they *don't know* and would cheapen your great plots with *sex*! It's fine to be uncomfortable with a subject, and you don't even *have* to give a reason why. But your morality is not universal, and nor should it be. I literally think you yourself said it best in your post:\n\n&gt;  people \\[...\\] have different tastes",
