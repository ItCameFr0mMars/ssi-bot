For every 10 applicants my server gets, seven are the type to abuse their characters abilities. I had to make a dice system because otherwise people were abusing the game.   \n\n\nThere's plenty of stories out there that don't use dice, plenty that do. You just need to find the ones that work for you. That doesn't mean others that aren't your cuppa aren't also valid.   \n\n\nAlso, DnD *is* roleplaying, jsyk.

            "body": "Dnd is also roleplay, but it is a tabletop game with rulebooks, stats of your characters etc.\n\nForum roleplay instead, does not have usually all these rules for one simple reason, it is more accessible and you do not have to balance idk your average dwarf with four arms that shoots lasers from eyes and juggles around rock boulders with the power of earth magic. I probably made an exagerate example (and since I do not know DnD I am unusure if this can be doable or not in there, I assume it usually doesn't) but the point is forum RP is about description and writing characters with less technicalisms and boundaries to respect than your average Forum RP.\nPlus you can usually write your own story without speaking with the admins that much... At times forum rps have no goal and it is just a bunch of people doing stuff in different places.\n\nYou're gonna butcher me in the comments, DnD/tabletop fans I know.\nIn my defence I want to say my sis plays it (3rd edition) and I love anytime she tells me about their stories... I am fascinated by it and if I disrespected your game, please point that out to me, as I will apologise.\n\nReturning to the main topic, forum RP doesn't have proper stats like strength charisma, wisdom, dexterity etc.\nNothing apart your backstory and character sheet points out your character is a fiersome warrior who fought wars. If you ever insert dice rolls in a combat RP of that sort you most likely will understand that... They will either make your character a warrior that slays beasts with one poke of the swords as it's in constant nat 20 or a trippy guy who slips at every turn or misses all the attacks with 1's and 2's\nIn forum RP you don't have the stats to back up your character is strong or fast or magically gifted and can slay goblin easily. If the goblin keep rolling nat 20's and you 3's you will most likely be beaten by a child with a knife despite you have an immense backstory of fighting dragons.\nA fight against a dragon could be easier than a bunch of starving goblins... It is only ridiculous, in the bad sense of the term because it denies anything the character should be about and promotes RNG (random number generator) madness. \n\nPlus, cheaters could be at every turn of the road. A player of mine constantly used the dice (despite i was telling her to stop) and was claiming to roll 20s for something like 30 turns as she clearly wanted to murder my character (she was using an app). It doesn't add up, it isn't fair, it's only RNG at its most free state.\n\nNever use your dices unless you have stats to work with that can sum up to your roll. Otherwise you're most likely to have a surreal roleplay",
