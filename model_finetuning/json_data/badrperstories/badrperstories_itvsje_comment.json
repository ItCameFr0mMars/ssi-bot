However I have never experienced having an obligatory feedback system. \n\nOverall the idea is not bad, I get that it feels good to receive compliments about your writing and/or character, so I understand that it is kinda hurtful that you don't receive them only because you are doing your job as an owner. \nI mean... it's because you are doing so much work that you *should* receive them, at least every now and then. \n\nI admit that I don't receive compliments too often, I mean if people want to then good, if they don't then it's okay too, at least in my case. That doesn't mean that I have never received them though, and when it happens then I feel good, also because I think that they help building up your confidence as well. I might not have the best characters in the world, but I agree that I want my characters to be noticed at least a bit.\n\nSo in the end I am gonna say that being an admin is a thankless, stressful and terrible job. You are seen as something terrifying or that seeks attention, and the second you do something wrong, then you are automatically a tyrant.",

            "body": "&gt; It feels that by both 1) being the owner and 2) being a proactive player people get... Intimidated, or resentful...? I've felt the resentful/jealous vibe way strongly from writers who have since dropped out, which is insane to me because, like, I'm barely getting any compliments... This is going to sound awful, but it feels like by being Too Good, people don't think I should be told that I am Good. Which sounds like what a crazy egomaniacal person would say, but I promise, truly promise that I'm not this far up my ass. I just want to have fun with my writers and get reciprocity when it comes to lifting characters up and letting them have a moment in the spotlight. I think by being proactive and constantly stirring the server up to get activity, other players feel like I am already getting too much attention. \n\nSometimes players lapse into introverted narcissist territory (\"this person who has this thing/attribute I want is being Mean To Me Somehow\", idk if you've seen Watamote but it does a pretty on-point job of it) or they don't put in the work in.  You shouldn't have to catherd for activity, that's a problem with the players, if they channel their feelings of inadequacy into jealousy/anger that's on them.",

            "body": "Mood. I just posted a \"Admin is a thankless job\" on here lol.   \nI remember years ago hearing about this phenomenon where Admins see less play over all in their own servers. There was a word for it, I just can't remember it, but it's exactly what you've described. I've often had players who will accuse me of being in a clique with one or two other players in the server because most of my scenes are \"closed\" which means only specific people, who know ahead of time, can join. But every now and then, I'll post an \"open\" scene, which for us is where anyone can just hop in, they don't need to ask. When I do that, it just sits there...for days... before I either turn it into a solo scene and close it out of frustration, or one of my mods drops their character in.   \n\n\nIt sometimes feels like the players are staging a coup intent on proving to me that I'm trash and no one wants to write with me. They want to write in my world, but not with me. Not only is it that they compliment one another's characters and never mine, but people will actively *drag* my characters, making fun of their arcs in the ooc chat like they're a big joke. Not just light hearted banter either.   \n\n\nSo then i go into my hole, i stop engaging, I stick to writing with players I know like my characters and want to write with me - then about two weeks of that, someone complains that I'm in a clique despite not allowing cliques in the server. There's a difference between only writing with your friends and bullying others out of stories vs being bullied out of a story and forced to only play with your friends.",
