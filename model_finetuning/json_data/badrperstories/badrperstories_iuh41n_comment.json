            "body": "Admittedly, I know nothing about Amino RP and this is written in bit of a little hard too follow format, but what I glean is that he's really toxic. I would argue that no one has the right to tear into other people or their characters except maybe an Admin if they're correcting something. He sounds like he's firstly bitter that despite having had two of these types of RPs himself, neither worked out, so he's attempting to make you seem like a bad Mod so that your story fails to. In saying you should do this or that, he's trying to turn your story into his.   \n\n\nOn top of that, his running commentary on your characters or anyone else's characters is not only unwanted, it's unwarranted. He has absolutely no business commenting on other people's writing. He comes off as a massive bully by basically shitting on everyone who isn't playing the way he would play something.   \n\n\nWhile I can't say whether you should or should not hold a Staff position, I definitely don't think you should be taking any advice at all from someone like this.",

It was a situation where he'd make everyone in the group team up on the girls, and anyone who was seen associating with or defending the females in the group would be bullied relentlessly by everyone. \n\nDidn't stop there.\n\nI was told to date him. Thing is, he had a girl who was into him and who he was talking to. Another abusive sociopath \\[somehow a collective of them if I'm being honest\\] threatened to kick me from the group when we broke up. So he gave me an out. He told me that if I dated him, I wouldn't lose all of my friends. He was 18/19. I was 16. He had another girl- this girl came to fucking *hate* me. Mostly because he'd given us an ultimatum.\n\nBoth of us or both of us were gone. \n\nHe trashed everything. My roleplay. My characters. He abused me infinitely, and this was all while I was dating him. I felt disgusted every day. I still do. She was forced into it as well.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether or not he's a sociopath. It matters how you feel. I suggest you either leave, or report him to the admins with proof of your interactions. Unluckily, mine was one that controlled the entire group. I had no escape, and I was a lonely kid with a lot of the same issues you have. If you have a chance to leave, take it. If you think you can get him ousted?   \n\n\n**Do it.** \n\nYou'll be saving someone in the long run, whether it is yourself or another person.",
