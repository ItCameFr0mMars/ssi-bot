            "body": "I mean, I've never been in an RP-focus MMORPG guild or clan, but I have lead a pile guilds/clans in a number of different MMOs, RPG or not.\n\nFundamentally, you need a pile of players with similar mindsets for it to work. If your core wants to take things the game seriously, it *will* be more serious, otherwise you alienate your core and create tension by picking up people who just won't be a fit. If it is super casual, picking up people who want something more serious is a disservice to everyone - again, it will create tension and drama.\n\nI don't know what guilds in ESO look like, but I would expect that if you want a super-casual RP focused guild, they exist? If you want some sort of hybrid, that might be more difficult. If you want to mostly RP with your friends but be in a super-serious content/raiding/whatever guild for some reason, then those two things might be at odds, and that is a reality you have to accept.\n\nIf you just want to RP, just join a casual RP guild? Maybe I'm out of touch enough that those simply don't exist, but that would surprise me - no requirements casual guilds exist in every game I've ever touched, RP or not.",

The first games in the series were all single player RPGs in that world and people really grew attached to that. So when they go on to online and dealing with other people, they want the human interaction but they also really want that same sort of world-based grounding they had while playing a single player game. Not to mention the elder scrolls mythos has highly dedicated lore junkies. You know the type the ones that tell you the imperials are the \"correct\" faction to pick in Skyrim despite JARL STORMCLOAK BEING THE RIGHTFUL KING OF SKYRIM!",

            "body": "I've been a roleplayer now for some twenty years, through forums, communities, MMOs and whatever else. I've found that for all the different mediums there's a lot of constants.\n\nIt's a sad truth that Roleplay communities tend to fill up with the worst people. Petty minded, overly dramatic, egotistical and prone to drama. For them, roleplay isn't about the give and take of shared storytelling; it's about their character and their story, and you're just there to witness it, bask in their awesomeness and maybe congradulate them along the way. And these sorts of people will inevitably float to the top, usually supported and empowered by communities that will also actively shield them because they are a so-called \"good\" RPer.\n\nControl is a key tool to these people. Gatekeeping RP through stupidly high standards like application processes makes sure that they only interact with the \"right\" people; is those that will feed their egos, those that will adhere to their own impossible standards, those that haven't been ostracised by the community for whatever reason, real or imagined, and so on",
