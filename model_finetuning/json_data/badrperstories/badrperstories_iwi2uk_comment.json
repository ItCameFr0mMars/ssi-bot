I mean, if they want to imagine your character as some busty porn actress, I guess have at it. That's totally their prerogative, but yeah, it seems like personality and temperament, and the stuff you can actually convey through the writing should be at least as important as however they want to picture the character.\n\nPersonally, I'll often ask my partners what they go for in terms of build/looks so I can try to accommodate in the descriptions, but also personality and demeanor, since that's going to come through more readily in the writing. Weirdly enough, I've had potential partners say more than once that no one ever asked them that.\n\nFolks who are a little too insistent with the face-claims put me off. If I see an ad where folks are discussing what face-claims they use, or, worse yet, which ones they want their *partners* to use? I'm out. I can obsess over Pinterest boards with the best of 'em, but at least give me the right to decide on the specifics of my character's appearance (with input, of course). Besides, I often find it hard to settle on just one \"look.\" I like to use photos and artwork, both, and try to go for an overall impression, but it's always secondary to the writing itself. That IS the medium, after all.",
