            "body": "I guess it would depend on how it's played, so not necessarily.  \n\n\nIIRC China has a lot of superstitions in its history, like the number 4 being bad luck or red being lucky, or something like that. A charm could be like a good luck charm, something people believe in to bring them the thing they want but whether it does or not is purely coincidental. Similarly curses can just be something believed in that brings bad luck and misfortune.   \n\n\nIf she was planning on making it into a type of dice mechanic where a character was cursed and they believed they were cursed, they might be more inclined to fumble doing something and then their writer would roll a lower dice because psychologically, if you expect yourself to fail, you're more likely to fail. Similarly, if someone believes they have a charm that will bring them a thing, then the player can roll a higher dice for better results because when people believe they have a better shot at success, they're more likely to reach success purely because of their attitude.   \n\n\nI don't think that's necessarily magic at all, if anything it adds more depth and realism to the game because the characters have to be believing in something really strongly.",
