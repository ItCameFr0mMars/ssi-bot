But from what I've seen when I got back in the game a few months back after a few years hiatus, I have to say that I agree with you.  Found it very cliquey and melodramatic instead of the fun memories I had.  \n\nI now see it as fandom roleplay; you need to find people that not only see the world in the same way you do, but that see rp in a similar way as well.  And that can be hard to find.",
