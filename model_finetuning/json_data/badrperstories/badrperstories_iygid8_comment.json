I'd like to speak about this more.\n\nTo be honest, if you give me some details I could accept a 1 year old fantasy child... Perhaps this character grown ultra fast due to magic, got dropped in a dimension where they learnt some things, it is a trait of a specie...\n\nMy character's daughter for instance was born and accidentally drunk some elven water some day later, so the next day she was 16 and learnt by dreams how to talk and move as an adolescent. This way it is a functional character. I mostly done this because I have seen that toddlers are hard to handle in rp:\n\nHaving a toddler as first character let me tell you it is usually useless, expecially in combat or dialogue RP. One character I had to approve is something like 3 years old and the only thing they does is asking for getting lift up and rocked... It is at best a waste of time. I told the player about this issue before I approved but they say it was cool, so now it's just vegetating between some arms of others.\n\nThen of course if the RP may involve nsfw it is illegal and reportable to authorities to do illegal acts with said child and people will surely have to stand trial. So be careful when you have an underage character. However, just as reference, remember Babette from TES Skyrim. She is an ageless vampire trapped in the body of a... Six year old? I think there are exceptions to the rule you stated before, but again, I don't know much of this baby assassin. Was this character seriously 1 y old and looked like a 1 y old??",
