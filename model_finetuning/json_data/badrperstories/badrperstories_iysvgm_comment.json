But, like with all things, communication is important in roleplay. \n\nAsk them about it. They could be going through something in their life, they could have anxiety themselves.  \n\nI have anxiety and depression, and know that when I'm feeling down for whatever reason I often don't want to talk to anyone. I'll get messages, and will just open them to get rid of a notification. Don't even bother to say I don't feel like talking, etc. It's a bad habit, and one I can't really explain. But It's there. \n\nSo, just kindly ask your partner if things are ok with them, and that can open a conversation about either personal stuff if that's the case, or if they aren't into the rp, and so on.",

You can try asking for when they're free to do a bunch of responses back to back I guess?  But sometimes life gets in the way.",

I've made the mistake before of assuming a partner who's gone silent too long is suddenly not interested, only to find out they were sick or busy with work or remodeling their bathroom. My point is, half the time it's nothing personal -- they've just got other stuff going on. That's normal.\n\nIf you're just jonesing for more RP, why not seek out other partners to fill the gap? It'll spread out the focus so you're not quite as intent on just that one partner anymore, plus maybe the experience will help reinforce the notion that all this is normal, different partners have different ways of doing things, plus, new stories to boot!\n\nThe main thing is, as much as your anxiety might tell you it's you, probably 90% of the time, it isn't. ;)",
