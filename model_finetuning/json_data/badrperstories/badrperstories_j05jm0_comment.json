It's terrible. I've seen similar dynamics in some RP groups before, and the abuser often had several people wrapped up into a similar obsessive and abusive dynamic, turning them against each other at various times. \n\nSeeing them able to have empathy for the others who had fallen for the abuser's tricks and come together was a good thing. It removed a lot of the power that person had in that place. Calling those other people 'weasels' like that just seems like giving that guy power, and fuck that guy. \n\nOf course it's possible that OP was this guy's only victim, but he sounds horrible enough that I doubt it.",
