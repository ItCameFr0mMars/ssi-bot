Some people are active RPers who want active partners and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's the same as people who prefer patient and laid back partners who don't mind waiting weeks for replies. We all have our needs and preferences.\n\nThe problem is that such people that can follow that 48-hour rule *without fail* are very rare. Real life happens and circumstances change fast. People get sick. People go on trips to visit family. Sometimes they have to do overtime at work and are just too tired to RP. It's unrealistic to expect even the most active RPers to reply daily or once every two days all the time without fail. At some point, they will need to take a break to sort out real life stuff, and at that point, patience and understanding will go a long way. \n\nI agree with you getting out of that RP, though. I wouldn't want to deal with a partner like that either. He handled the situation quite poorly.",

What I disagree about his rule is how strict he is about it and how little empathy he had for your real life situation. I know what it's like to get anxious when a partner has to take a break due to real life, but that's part of the RPing hobby we have to accept. RP partnerships should be built on respect. \n\nHe can do something about it by learning from that experience and realizing that people have lives outside of RP. That's up to him though. Some people learn from their mistakes, others never do. The point is, he treated you poorly and that alone makes your decision to leave him justified. I hope everything works out for you in real life and in RP. Best of wishes!",
