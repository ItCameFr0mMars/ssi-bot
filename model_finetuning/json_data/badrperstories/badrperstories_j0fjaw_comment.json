You should've blocked as soon as he brought that hard limit up, after you blocked him as soon as he brought it up, you wouldn't have to bring up that emotional memory, and you wouldn't have to deal with that person ever again. I understand wanting to give them chance, but if this topic really brings up so much emotional baggage then you should've blocked. Idk this is my opinion.",

            "body": "Ai, I can very much relate. I RP on a handful of Amino\u2019s, and I\u2019ve given one creepy User way too many passes to not report them or keep RP\u2019ing with them due to guilttripping, frequent rants about them \u201cnot being the main character\u201d (a term for a popular User), and even contributing to another problematic User\u2019s sociopath smear campaign by pretending to be some sort of victim of me.\n\n\nIn my case, I\u2019ve got a hard limit on \u201cforcefully dancing\u201d with any of my OCs. Especially if someone wants to go and \u201cdance\u201d with one of my kid OCs, and *very* much so with my semi-SIOC. This is easily traceable to a past trauma of mine, and whilst I do use my adventurous writing to get over it, I have an ironclad rule:\n\n\n**I don\u2019t. do. Lemon.**\n\n\nSadly, the intrusive User was going through rocky puberty.\n\n\nThey first responded to a Bounty Arc ad of mine, where it soon became *very* apparent that he was up to no good. My semi-SIOC was one of the *Alive-at-all-Costs* bounties, and he PM\u2019ed me if he could \u201ckeep her for himself for just a few hours after capture. Perhaps after a bit of fun, they could fall in love.\u201d\n\n\n**No.**\n\n\nNever went through with it, reported it a few weeks later due to hearing from others that he was being just as creepy, then he got the big ban.\n\n\n... but later I got banned due to giving another User lore on the Amino because their arcs were being rejected due to lore inconsistencies and wouldn\u2019t be helped out by Staff.\n\n\nLater, I arrived on the Amino of an ex-friend. The one who later spearheaded the smear campaign. Surprise-surprise, but the creepy User was there too. He specifically made an alien OC with a species background in \u201cforcefully dancing\u201d to procreate, and guilttripped me into entering a lady OC to become it\u2019s first victim of the evening. Me complaining about it tearing the PG-13 Amino guidelines a new one to the ex-friend resulted in a load of nothing, and even got me guilttripped into \u201ccompensating\u201d the creep by entering their very Public RP with most likely a lot of revenge motives.\n\n\nToo bad that he chose a final boss for a victim, and he lost with literally just one very well-calculated backstab disguised as a kiss.\n\n\nI got chewed out for days by having legally won without losing an OC to Lemoning. Rants about the creep \u201cnot being allowed to use very mature topics like forcing yourself onto another OC but they\u2019re allowed to have a semi-SIOC who has a trauma regarding it in their distant backstory\u201d, rants about me cheating whilst he clearly tried to twist the RP in his favour with autohits, Godmodding, Metagaming and Powergaming whilst I still fairly won by sticking to faulty Amino guidelines, such and such.\n\n\nGot guilttripped in having my semi-SIOC being kidnapped by more of those \u201cforcefully dancing\u201d alien OCs because I \u201chad to compensate for my last win\u201d, got really upset when some of their important belongings like a headband and a necklace were completely destroyed and their physique got ruined into being all big underaged boobs, butts and brain scramble. Thank god I got them outta there before bad stuff happened, but the second that he tried to creep on that semi-SIOC\u2019s mentor and father figure with those aliens, I just up and left.\n\n\nSmear campaign got me villainized and banned, went back to the previous Amino who finally lifted that lore ban after a sit-down and a few apologies as the Agent was passing the baton to another, and have been trying to help a true friend\u2019s Amino get into shape ever since.\n\n\nI suppose it\u2019ll have to do for RP experience. I\u2019ll absolutely break off any new creeps that try to do the same at an instance, no matter if I\u2019ll get banned or blackened. It\u2019s not my job to be another User\u2019s fetish partner, especially when I\u2019m anything but a Lemon User. I RP so that I can test my writing for other things. \u201cMain character\u201d or not, I don\u2019t owe an ignorant pompous Lemon User advice, power, RP\u2019s pr gratification.\n\n\nAnd I hope you\u2019ll have much better RP\u2019s from now on, too! Show\u2019em you don\u2019t owe\u2019m! And good luck!",
