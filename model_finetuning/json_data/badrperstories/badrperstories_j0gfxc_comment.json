In both their advertisement and their conversation with me, they went on at length about their distaste for ghosting. They expressed feeling very relieved to finding someone (me) that seemed dedicated, because nothing was worse or more difficult to sympathize with than ghosting. I kept my opinion on the subject somewhat muted because I could sense that they they would have a hard time with push back. I was gentle in sharing my feelings, and they repeated that there was no way to empathize with someone who ghosts, and how burned out she was by it. I felt like that was fair enough, and again assured I had to intent on ghosting myself.\n\nMy opinion, which I told her, is the same as others in this thread. Maybe that person prefers plotting and ooc talking more than they do actually writing. Maybe they just went feeling the chemistry after all and are uncomfortable with confrontation. Whatever the case, I don't sweat it. If someone stops responding, I'll reach out once, give them a few days, and then remove them. My feeling is that if they do return on some off chance, they can be responsible for re-listing and reaching out to me. If they don't, whatever. Not a big deal and likely for the best.\n\nWe ended the conversation with big plans and the promise of getting together the following day. We planned to finish plotting and get going with writing. All good.\n\nBut then they ghosted, because of course.",

            "body": "&gt; I just had an interaction with someone that certainly seemed very interested. Actually, fawning and a little over the top about it for a first time interaction. In both their advertisement and their conversation with me, they went on at length about their distaste for ghosting. They expressed feeling very relieved to finding someone (me) that seemed dedicated, because nothing was worse or more difficult to sympathize with than ghosting. I kept my opinion on the subject somewhat muted because I could sense that they they would have a hard time with push back. I was gentle in sharing my feelings, and they repeated that there was no way to empathize with someone who ghosts, and how burned out she was by it. I felt like that was fair enough, and again assured I had to intent on ghosting myself.\n\nWas expecting the story to end with the person finally ghosting you. That happened to me-\n\n&gt;We ended the conversation with big plans and the promise of getting together the following day. We planned to finish plotting and get going with writing. All good.\n\n&gt;But then they ghosted, because of course.\n\n...Ayeeep. \n\nThough in my case, it was primarily on the advertisement where they complained about ghosting, and reading it made me really connect with them because I was also getting frustrated about being ghosted at the time.",
