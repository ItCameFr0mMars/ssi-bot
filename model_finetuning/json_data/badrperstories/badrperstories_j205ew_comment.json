Yes I am aware of my grammatical errors because I am doing this on my tiny phone which is bound to have errors in the post. I am not elitist, just confused on why people won't want to roleplay with me because they do one look at the appearance of your profile and immediately reject you. I don't HAVE high standards for my partners either, they were the ones who told me to hit them up if they don't RESPOND within a week and never answered but when I take a time off that same person bombards me with questions. Preferences should also be respected so I am not going to do a smut-based roleplay when it is mostly suppose to be a story as me and said partner agreed on.\n\nSorry if I should've just went along with everyone's crap and have no standards of my own. :)",
