And every time I'm looking it up, I find this one post which irks me everytime, it basically goes\n\n- it HAS to be Canon x OC (\"You play Canon characters and I play my OC\")\n- its important to keep the characteristics of the characters (to which I also agree to a certain grade tho)\n- you have to be okay with playing a lot of side characters (\"so basically you play the majority of the Canon characters while I play only one and probably sprinkle one or two more OCs in it for spice\")\n\nWhich is making me kinda feel like....just read a fanfic, man....\n\nAnother thing I also absolutely hate and which are a red flag to me is:\n\n- Messaging someone because of their ad then then them basically having NO IDEA what they wanna do, and I have to pull everything out of their ass. which is also reason enough for me to drop it again because it just...also gives me the vibes that they won't contribute a lot to the ongoing RP either and I have to carry it.\n\nI hope I didn't completely miss the point of this haha but I just thought this might be the appropriate place to let go of my thoughts about this haha",

Obviously, everyone has some hard limits, and articulating those is worthwhile. However, when a laundry list of nit-picks are presented as deal breakers, it gives the impression that someone is going to be *really* hard to deal with - what you said about feeling like you're going to be walking on eggshells, really.\n\nBut this is where the 'two sides of the same coin' come in for me: someone making an ad expressing almost identical preferences could come off as perfectly pleasant if they took the time to frame things as what they *are* looking for - same specificity, but positive instead of negative framing.\n\nWhen I read something, I need to feel like I can have a conversation, and work out if we're going to come to something mutually desirable.

You can add every conceivable 'won't do' to your ad, and it won't prevent people from pushing boundaries or not really reading the ad - it might even reduce the likelihood of people reading it, depending on the length.\n\nAnd honestly, you *can* go around saying you don't do that - you aren't shaming anyone, and being able to say 'no' is fairly integral to adult communication, especially where anything even vaguely related to sex is involved. If someone frames you saying 'no thank you' as shaming them, *they are the asshole* who is trying to guilt you into going with something you aren't comfortable with, whether you specifically excluded their niche fetish or not.\n\nClarifying what you are looking for and hard limits is important and useful to everyone involved - you are completely correct. I just think that trying to 'filter out' bad partners in ads with huge lists of 'won'ts' is more likely to filter out the ones who actually bother to read your whole post and make an effort to understand what you want, rather than those who won't read and don't care - and the latter are the ones who are probably the cause of the long 'won't' list anyway.",

It branches off the idea of forced obligation some of these other comments describe. You have to play canon, you have to guide the storyline, you have to play smut. Telling me what I HAVE to do, versus what they'd LIKE to do. One of those wordings is much more approachable than the other.",

And I don't want to have to send you a laundry list of questions to find out what you actually want to write and if our writing styles are compatible.\n* They say they like dark and taboo plots, but give no examples of what that entails. This has meant everything from \"the ending is ambiguous rather than fluffy\" to \"even a highly sanitized version of this plot would make you throw up in your mouth\".\n* They insist their partner be a certain gender. I don't care if someone requests a particular character gender, or only writes MxF or what have you, but restrictions on the writer (beyond age) is a huge red flag. Especially if they insist the writer and character are the same gender.\n* They say they like pushing boundaries and comfort zones.\n* They say they have limits but won't mention them unless you do something to cross them. This isn't Battleship or blind man's bluff.\n* The request states something in a condescending way, for example, saying that they only write long posts because short posts are inferior, rather than saying they only write long posts because of personal preference.\n* The request is hard to read because of typos or sentence structure.\n* The request states some variety of \"If you do x, fuck you\". Uhhhhh.\n* The request is a laundry list of things the partner must and must not do. Dude, I'm here to have fun, not read what looks like a legal contract.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the other person's response to my ad:\n\n* \"You said you didn't write x, but-\" I'm gonna stop you right there. No. Related to this, they suggest a plot or dynamic that includes something I said I didn't want to write.\n* They say they love my idea, then proceed to ask for major changes to not only the plot but the character I have in mind to play. I don't care if you want to change up my idea, but be up front about it.\n* They ask me to write canon/OC with myself playing the canon. They have no plot or hook in mind, just a desire to have the characters in a relationship. 75% of the time, the canon is a dick that they want played more nicely. 90% of the time, their OC is a self-insert. 100% of the time, the canon would have no reason to know the OC exists in the first place, much less any reason to be in a relationship.\n* \"Wanna rp?\" Wanna give me more than two words?\n* I specifically state I am looking for private/1x1 roleplay and they try to recruit me to their group. Can you not read? Or did you read that I am not looking for what you have to offer and message me anyway? I ask so I know how much to judge you.\n* They say they saw my ad, loved it, and would love to roleplay! When I ask them what they liked about my ad, they can't come up with an answer, or even ask me for a link to it so they can check. If you message so many people that you have no idea who I am...",
