They made it clear from the start of the community that they didn't trust me. They removed me once before over me joking with a friend in the subreddit discord. I basically had to fight to prove that it was a joke (all over a innoncent, not crude or inappropriate nickname). My friend even had to back me saying it was a joke. They had removed me as a mod before even asking what happened. When I got my mid position back I was careful, watched everything that I said.\n\nI made some 'friends' in the discord and decided to try and do a private group rp with them. We had never had problems before and I thought it would be fun. We started planning and I saw red flags. They weren't bad people, I just saw it as this wasn't going to personally work for me as a rp. We stated are disagreements and knowing my temper I said I wasn't going to sat much because I didn't want to hurt anyone or have it bleed into the sub. \n\nNext thing I know I am removed as a mod and the other mods say I was reported for punishing people and that the members were afraid of being blacklisted. I hadn't said anything of the sort to the group. I sent all the screenshots and the mods admitted it looked like a misunderstanding. I asked the mods how I was supposed to mod and help the community if they don't trust me enough to come to me with a problem before removing me. I was told 'consider being relieved of your duties'. That was it. I posted in the group basically heartbroken and confused and the reply was \"Sorry it had to come to this.\" The same friend backed me completely and called bs but I was tired of fighting.",

You mentioned your temper, did that get the better of you in talks with the other mods, maybe, and they didn't feel comfortable with it even if you meant no harm? \n\nOverall it sounds like a bad experience all around and a bad fit which always feels terrible when you were invested in the community.",

I'm mad they called me a liar, I'm sad that I lost friends and a community I loved, and confused as to why I allowed myself to get so invested.

I so desperately want to say that I want to see you fail, but I don't. That community was created for a reason and I don't want it to go to waste. That being said. Besides the two writing partners that stood by me and saw through all the crap, I think I'm done with rp.* \n\nThis is manipulative as all hell and just further throws me out of your good graces. I don't fall to manipulation. As for this, you're not giving the entire story. Please don't make this harder than it has to be. You're still trying to prove that you're a nice guy. If you were a nice guy, you would understand why that had to be done. Not only were three people accusing you of things, there's been multiple sources of drama around you.

            "body": "Here to second Xol's comment, honestly. This story is really one-sided and manipulative. Our two subreddits started for the same reason - to give role players another platform where they wouldn't be attacked the way the mod of the *infamous other subreddit* attacks her own users. It was a great goal. And you were really helpful, Alfie, on here, but admittedly there were some times where you crossed the line between taking correct action to make the situation better and being outright insulting to that \"particular Mod\" in a way that discredited the entire cause.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your \"jokes\" were a big part of why I ultimately left the server. I usually don't hang out in hubs, but because we were all aligned in our goal for the RP community, I wanted to stay in the server. I left after my \"featured writer\" ended because because your jokes were honestly offensive, abrasive, and aggressive most of the time. I really have no trouble believing that there were multiple sources of drama circling you, as u/Xoldrake said, because you didn't seem to understand that as a Mod, you really can't go making jokes at the expense of your users. Banter is great until it's not. People don't want to go against you because every single one of your users had a bad experience where they *were* blacklisted by a power-hungry Mod. Maybe the other Mods of the subreddit should have trusted you, but they didn't know you. Most of the role players who came in did not know you, we didn't know these were jokes. They felt like thinly veiled threats.   \n\n\nI'm so disheartened to see this happened in such a new sub so quickly, but I'd argue it had to happen. Players need to see that new subs in the community sparking up are not going to be more of the same.   \n\n\nThe fact that you came on *here* to vent while saying \" I so desperately want to say that I want to see you fail, but I don't. That community was created for a reason and I don't want it to go to waste.\" feels insincere. Again, as Xoldrake pointed out, it's manipulative. This reads like you want to take the user base with you so you're trying to paint yourself as a victim. The issue is that the community came from a situation where they were bullied out, the space you *helped* create was supposed to be a safe one but you honestly left a lot of us feeling like we had to walk on egg shells just to be allowed to stay in it. Removing you as a Mod didn't remove you from that community.   \n\n\nThe sub and server needed actual *leadership.* Do you know what a leader would have done in that situation?   \nTalked it out with the people in question like an adult, for one. Not gone on a smear campaign on reddit. Minimized the drama. Taken the high road.   \n\n\n You know, all the things Xoldrake did?  \n\n\n You weren't banned, blocked, or blacklisted. You could have stayed a part of that community, but you elected to what- rage quit because you weren't in power anymore? That tells me everything I need to know. Our community cannot withstand another Elphie right now. And you seemed to pose yourself to be just like her. Do you seriously not see how potentially damaging that could have been if left unchecked? If your only interest in that group lay with your power, you should not have that power. It's why the r/Roleplay situation got as bad as it did.",

            "body": "Alfie, that's a direct lie in itself, but it is what you told them in mod chats. I gave my testimony on it, the other two were asked immediately after in a private setting without knowledge of what was happening beyond the minor RP disagreement. Are we children to do things without point? No. I wasn't even involved in the roleplay prospect of the issue. My involvement came up with a casual comment that happened to fall into the right ears. You can keep clinging to this idea that you didn't, but I'll trust in myself and the others that were in the vc with you that night. You most certainly did not mention a group effort, and seemed to have your feelings hurt by the idea of Xol's ownership when I said it. I could have been a great friend Alfie. I enjoyed your company, I hung on for hours beyond what I intended. In fact, when I was going through things a few days after, the one person I thought of opening up to in a DM was you. That possibility stopped the very moment you accused myself and the others of lying when they confronted you about it. When you create something like this, you don't do it for the ego. It's not for the self. If running a group provides that much of an ego boost, then you should reevaluate your priorities. And that's my final word on it. Goodbye, Alfie.",
