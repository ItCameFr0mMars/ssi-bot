It sounds like in both situations, the other writers are just projecting their personality desires onto your characters because they're attractive - which isn't real romance. That's a crush. That's nothing. You deserve the chance to experience your characters as single people without automatically getting them into a ship, much less being forced into one. The male character can say the singing-character was off-putting because of how she teased him. The female character can dip because the guy's coming off as serial-killer-clingy. Done and done.   \n\n\nHave them play with some other people if that doesn't give the two role players enough of a hint. They're putting your characters on a ship for a story you never consented to.",

            "body": "It kinda sounds to me like they're just trying to find some common ground and a reason to interact with your characters. Such as your partner having her character sing a Spanish song --- it would give them more of an excuse to interact. After all, there has to be *something* to roleplay. Romance and attraction are, of course, an easy justification for characters to approach each other. If you're not interested in such a storyline, I'd speak up and let them know. But calling it \"bad RP\" if your partners are just making an effort to draw your characters out and find a reason to talk to/interact with them sounds a little overly harsh. Back when I used to do more group RP, I'd try and have my characters be more pro-active and strike up conversations with strangers, because otherwise, we'd all just be sitting in a bar together, drinking separately and not interacting, and what fun is that?\n\nDefinitely talk to them if you're not interested in the romance angle. They won't know otherwise.",
