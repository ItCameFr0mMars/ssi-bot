Literally. Like... Him and Phin really aren't close. This just bothered me -so- hard. \n\nIllidari also have 360 sight. Now... I say my Illidari doesn't channel this all the time, and so it isn't why Red saw Anne down. But One refuses to say Illidari have a choice over whether or not to see 360 all the time (even though... lore says they can) and so ignores/argues that about Red. Then says Red COULDN'T have seen Anne down behind them? Like... Omg.",
