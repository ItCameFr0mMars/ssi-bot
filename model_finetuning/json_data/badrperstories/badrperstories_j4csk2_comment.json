Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that there are certain roles\u2014 women in het pairings, and the \u2018sub\u2019 in gay and lesbian pairings specifically\u2014 that are more popular than the opposite.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve looked for those, though, I\u2019ve also encountered a situation that you did not list. In said situation, a potential partner will suggest *two roleplays*, or multiple pairings in said roleplay: one where you play the desired role, and one where they do.\n\nMy word of advice is to never, ever do this. It never works. It is inevitable that they will somehow always find the time and inspiration to reply to the one where they\u2019re the girl or sub or whatever, but they\u2019ll always have \u2018writer\u2019s block\u2019 for the one where you are! Don\u2019t agree to do this sort of arrangement! It\u2019s a trap!!\n\nLearn from my mistakes!!!",

            "body": "It is a really weird pridicament, what people are comfortable with what and who is open to play it. I have known for awhile that circles with mostly cis straight women roleplaying have a lot women playing men, because men suck and get creepy even if you tell them you don't want NSFW. But it does lead to folks like you kinda not getting what you want ever. People use the good nature of filling things in and helping out. \n\nIt might be good to maybe take a step back from roleplay, playing with women in a romantic dynamic and are not really gay isn't super healthy unless you are purely their for the academic craft of creative writing. As a lesbain myself I am always a little cautious of it when I see people that say they are straight willing to do yeering extreme romances. It usually isnt great for either party long. A gay woman wants to be with someone that understands the subject matter more, and the straight person is really just looking for a roleplay with a man that doesn't get creepy. \n\nMy only other alternative solution is to be very careful with your vetting process, and to stay picky. I know the urge to roleplay gets you and you just take the first partner there some timed but you need to have the standards that make you happy in place. As a trans woman I just dont work with people that dont know how to interact with me and are problamiafic. It saves me a lot of headaches and feeling like trash.",

I seem to end up playing male roles quite a bit, which I don't *mind* \\-- it's fun getting into guys' heads and trying to navigate the perks and pitfalls of masculinity -- but every now and then I miss the chance to play my own gender. Most of my partners seem to be straight cis-women, like myself, I guess because we just vibe better and have similar sensibilities. The few times I've played with males have been more short-lived (thankfully, not because of any ickiness on their parts -- the RPs just sorta fizzled out, as they so often do). \n\nBut it does seem to be a common trend to see posts from straight women saying they *only* want to play the female role. That just seems a bit unfair and limited. I'll play any ol' role and like to pepper in various NPCs, and if some of them grow into viable characters, all the better! It's nice to have options and let the roleplay grow organically. But seeing ads that emphasize just one role, or that they might \"double,\" grudgingly, tends to put me off. Unless the premise is just *very* tempting, I'll usually steer clear of those one-role wonders.",

The \"submissive\" role is more popular because we all want to be cared for in some way or another.\n\nSo when you advertise you are a female wanting to play female or \"submissive\" you get a lot of male roleplayers who come at you wanting to do NSFW themes, including questionable fetishes such as scat, vore, mutilation, etc. And some male role players (not all) some can become quite aggressively creepy and obsessive.  \n\n\nI tend to play the male or dominant role in a role play, and I'm feeling the strain.

            "body": "I would disagree with that mindset, I think it is a bit of a stereotype. Dom and Sub dynamics (romantic or sexual) are oftentimes highly gendered even in non-cishet relationships. Preforming a Dom role is seen as masculine and doing a sub is feminine. This sets precedent for subs not making choices ever in a roleplay as the real world gender roles are letting the men/more masculine characters/doms being the one who chooses. Women/feminine characters/Subs are expected to respond to the action of the other end of the spectrum. \n\nThis is something really baked into society. You preform a gender role better by leaning into its stereotype. Following the examples around you that you see. Because it is so ingrained in the world around us a lot of people have a hard time processing things that reside in the grey areas of this. \n\nCis Women engaging with only being sub, and not exploring more about what they are interested in and finding their personal mix of traits is just the side effect of the problematic system. The opposite side of this is obviously guys being toxic self absorbed assholes. Being tough you are to have action vs being taught to have in action.\n\nOP has done self exploring in playing males roles and is thus a little more honest to herself and what she like to do. A lot of people are pretty brainwashed on that.",
