And that if anyone RPing any of the protagonists chose to write with the people RPing the villains, they were \"complicit\" and \"supporting/letting them get away with their bad deeds.\" They blocked every single person that in any way had an RP involving a villain from the series, or so much as mentioned finding the villains interesting. It was wild.\n\nSomeone else called me emotionally unstable and that I was \"ruining their fun\" and \"unfit to RP\" because I asked my followers not to send overly sexual asks anymore because it was making me uncomfortable. Ironically, this didn't stop them from repeatedly trying to get me to write with them again later, without ever apologizing. I eventually blocked them.",

            "body": "Hoo, boy. I RPed a few canon characters on Tumblr for a couple of years. I had some good times there with good partners, but I feel like people really took advantage of the blogging platform aspect so you'd get more purple prose in threads than anything else. Paragraphs of nothing, stories that didn't really go anywhere because the other person had to wax poetic for twenty paragraphs instead of helping me move the story along within two or three. I'd get mentally exhausted from trying to keep up with the meaningless, substance-less prose and eventually let my threads die. There's a time and place for such verboseness, not all the time. I don't have the energy to write like that all the time.\n\nTumblr RP got even worse with the \"container theme\" trend, where everyone's blog theme was a box with tiny text and pretty much illegible unless you read it from the dash. People would abuse small text and fancy tagging systems everywhere in their posts... It was just bad. Sure, I did it too, but not that much. I knew it was the beginning of the end for me as an RPer when all everyone cared about were pretty icons and aesthetics over genuinely good writing and characterization. Sadly, the RP site I frequented before my Tumblr stint eventually became Tumblr-lite with the need for pretty profiles, unicode fonts and weird standards... so I quit RPing altogether.\n\nMaybe I'm just old or have become some kind of jaded \"casual\" over the years, but I miss the days of instant messenger RPing with friends on AOL/MSN/Yahoo. At some point after those places went down, RP just wasn't the same for me. And I've noticed a difference in RPers now. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells or meet ridiculous standards just to write a story with someone. It's a real shame.",

            "body": "Aw, man, I feel so behind in joining this discussion, but I hope there's never too late to share some stories.\n\nTL;DR; That's going to be a long read. English is not my first language. But it is fun to revisit some not-so-fun memories. \n\nI have been roleplaying in tumblr since 2011 (? I think it was 2011) on and off. Currently off. Because I have so much anxiety over roleplaying and with how much tumblr has changed, I am afraid to step out of my comfort zone. But tumblr is the only place where I feel the most comfortable roleplaying in, for some reason.\n\nSo, a lot happened since then. I first started roleplaying in group roleplays. I no longer roleplay in them and I refuse for my own sanity. I always loved making friends for my characters. Platonic relationships are still my favorite ones to write, even to this day. I can't describe how much I love them. Romantic ships... are okay but I would never push anyone for them. I need chemistry. I need a build-up. But there has been times when my rping partner swung by my inbox with an idea and I believed it'd be fun.\n\nHowever, when we both would already start working towards building up our couple together, they'd deactivate all of a sudden or I'd wake up to a whole dashboard of my character's ship partner cheating on them. Did it hurt me? Yeah, I was a teenager and I hated that feeling. It made me feel bad and like I am not good enough, but I wish they at least told me that something's not right. I think timezones made it even more difficult for me to attain a ship partner who will hold onto their word. Most of my ships partners were located in the States. I am from Europe. I wept my 13/14 year old tears and moved on from that.\n\nI started 1x1 roleplaying. 1x1 roleplaying is.... amazing if you are able to find partners who will communicate with you even when they are not replying, just checking in and making sure to give you heads up. I've met someone amazing like this. But since lives pulled us apart due to how busy we've got, I only want to thank this person for taking a right-away notice that my ex was abusive towards me and they were the first person to call this behavior out before it became obvious to me.\n\nBut it is difficult. It is difficult because people are only interested in discussing characters. But have no interest in writing with you. They will drop out after a starter or a reply. They will ghost you.  They will delete everything after a couple of weeks and restart with a different character for a new 1x1 with somebody else.  I went through many 1x1s discussions that moved nowhere. And some people are incredibly picky with plot ideas. But when you ask them if they have anything to suggest, they go radio silence .Eo eo eo. Nowhere to be found. Loading.. error.. ..exe has left and expired. \n\nBut it was also the days when I used to roleplay more female characters.\n\nThe wild 2016 has come, I decided to try out indie roleplaying, it was super active back then. But let me let in you a secret- I always loved using kpop face claims (but about this later) or very underrated face claims that is not one of the Four Chrispocalypses (though I used Chris Evans, lol) and Riverdale. \n\nIndie roleplaying is one of my favorites. I love writing memes. Probably the moment I discovered responding to memes, that's when I have noticed that I truly loved developing my characters and inserting them in the various situations. That's when the brand new world  of creativity opened up for me. \n\nBut this is when I ran into some creeps. There was this one person who discussed things with me before roleplaying,  I nay'd a couple of things for him, we were good to go. Sadly, his responses turned so creepy that I, think, something inside of me became very triggered.  I tried working on my reply for him but no words were coming out.  I told him that we will no longer be doing roleplay, deleted my and his responses off of my blog, and I swiped him a block. This is the first time when I feel like I'm forced to do this on tumblr. \n\nBut does this person leave me alone? No, ahaha. He starts abusing anonymous button on my blog and sending me messages. I immediately know who is writing to me. He then leaves me a message saying, \"I'm so bored, can we  talk?\" and I never replied to him. A couple of days go in the silence before he begins to message me again. The block button on anonymous is clearly not working and something that tumblr needs to fix. I decide to remake my blog. He finds my blog and offers to roleplay with a couple of my characters. I tell him that I am not interested and I kindly ask him to leave me alone.\n\nLater, through one of my mutual acquaintances and when we talked about what happened to me, I found out that this person is very commonly talked about in the rpc. He still has people roleplaying with him. But everyone knows that he is an open transphobic and has harassed multiple roleplayers over the years. He also disrespects LGBTQ+ female characters on the frequent basis. \n\nBut from roleplaying female characters, I understood that it is difficult. Not everyone will want to roleplay with you. Your starters will get ignored in the tags. And I was open to interactions with anyone, including other female characters (and non-binaries too). \n\nThen I took a long hiatus from tumblr before returning back to it. I decided to give a try to male characters. I always wanted to write more of them but I always was the most hesitant about them - will I be able to capture the mood? Will I be able to capture the emotion correctly? And all kind of these silly questions - when I know that femininity/masculinity barely exists. \n\nYou know what shocked me right from the first day? How bombarded I was with love and attention ever since my first day of making an appearance in the tags. I've never had so much adoration towards my character since.. what? Never and I have been roleplaying over a decade! But soon I realized why is that and what is happening. Everyone were gushing about certain face claims. After a week or so, I started to notice that some of my characters are receiving love so little compared to the others. The most famous character I've ever had was the one with Chris Evans face claim.\n\n This is when it hit me .Everyone wants a taste of the face claim. Not your character. No one cares about how well written or how much love you have added into writing a biography for your character, they are more interested in shipping. Some of the people have approached me tossed me into a turmoil of ideas and already knew which character they wanted to use before I was able to say anything.\n\nNow listen, I do love Chris Evans and I have always been a Captain America girl, but this thirst dried any excitement of me as soon as I started to take a further notice of that. I think that if I would not have had realized, for sakes,  I would have felt more excitement towards interacting with other people. But I felt like someone sucked out the fun of me. But may Christopher never apply to me as a face again and this is when I put him in a safe box.",

It happens to me all the time??? It's like, I could be playing a well developed female OC  and a manchild and completely annoying male OC who anyone would hate in real life. And guess who got more attention/threads/girls to fuck around with? You guessed it, the manchild did! And if you play an unknown FACECLAIM, good luck to you because lord knows no one will notice you! \n\nI'm so sad someone took the joy out of playing your favourite fc, but I hope that maybe you have discovered someone new to love!

            "body": "Part 2, because Reddit hates me.\n\nSo, this is when I want to talk about the other pet peeves, just not experiences:\n\n\\- Tumblr rping community, no matter how hard they preach about the diversity in faces, refuses to roleplay with you if you use a face claim they don't thirst over. As someone who avidly uses Kpop face claims (and not even the most popular ones), I have received so much nay from the others, it pains me terribly. I won't forget how someone liked one of my calls for plotting and I approached them for a discussion. And I asked them if there's any character they would like to roleplay with. I mostly use kpop face claims.  I warned them. I was quickly shut down and told me that they would not really want them. They're okay with them but also.... you get the idea. I never replied back to them.  This was also very recent, such as a year ago.  \n\\- No one really cares about a character. No one wants to do friendship (or other connection) based roleplay with you unless you're lovers or ex-lovers. However their rules always state otherwise.   \n\\-  TOO. MUCH. PROSE.  Listen, I am an aspiring author and I do realize what prose means for writing. But you are now overdoing when you use that in roleplaying. Like one of my rping partners once told me before, \"I can't stress the blue orbs waving somewhere in the air\" and I have never agreed with him more. I don't care how the room looks like (and why does it even deserve two paragraphs about it?). I don't care the texture of the dress your character is wearing.  Give me your character's inner thoughts. Insert a funky, terribly hilarious fact about your character instead.  \n\\- Aesthetics. I feel like lots of people will refuse to roleplay with you if you don't have a certain aesthetic. I do love to work with graphics, so I love to design my own themes. But I feel like everyone wants for you to have fancy shmancy gif icons. I miss the old good, bigger gifs. Gif icons or just rp icons don't do much for me (and they only help you when your face claim barely has any resources). When I was browsing through the rp tags, I recently found a canon character rp blog who had to take 10 spaces for an each word. What kind of formatting is this?!   \n\\- Male vs female characters. No, while I don't roleplay my female characters, I won't shove them down anyone's throat for a ship. I already saw a couple of posts being broadcast around the dashboard, \"don't be surprised if no one wants to rp with your female characters, because you always force them for a ship\". I only want for my females to receive as much love as my male characters do.  I want people to interact with them and not drop them. \n\nI do love roleplaying on tumblr. It is fun. But what devastates me is how much it has changed. And I think it has become worse. There's so much drama over the smallest things, just because someone doesn't agree with how their character is being played. Like someone in the comments mentioned, \"if your character plays a villain - I want to do nothing with you\". I am talking about those kind of energies. Have this energy on calling out the creeps of the tumblr. \n\nI want to come back to it someday again, but I literally have no idea on what character I want to play. I have a rp blog where sometimes I create pages for various musings that I get. But this is where it ends for me. \n\nThe only fandom I have never truly roleplayed in, is anime world. Which makes me wonder how things would be different. I would always view their blogs with mesmerization because they always appeared to me as the ones who are having the most fun.",

That would be fantabulous tbh. \n\nTBH IT ONLY MAKES YOU FEEL SO SPECIAL UNTIL YOU REALIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING aoiajsdoiajsdiosajaosidj  And it is not even your male character they are after, they want your face claim! Not sure if you have ever had this happen to you- but once while reading someone's reply to me, I realized they have no idea about my character. And probably have not read a small biography I wrote for them. I wheezed.\n\nTbh there's a couple of male face claims that I always loved to use because they're just mad cute to me. But no one will ever want to rp with them. Why? Idk. And I always do my best to establish my characters as best as I can. I just always wanted to rp with someone for their character.\n\nI recently tried using a plus-size boy character, with a Noah Guthrie face claim. I really love him and I thought of a cute character for him. An absolute country bumpkin who just arrived to the big city. NO ONE WANTS TO RP WITH HIM. N O O N E.\n\nTbh I still love Chris Evans and I would be more than happy to use him. It is hard for me to replace a face claim. They are like my baby. And Alexia Demie is so beautiful -yes!!!! I don't think I have ever stumbled upon anyone using her before, so please. I love people seeing use face claims no one else would do.\n\nI just wish that people realize one day that in rping, a CHARACTER matters.  You are interacting with a character after all. A face claim is just... a face claim. It is just like an accessory, nothing else. \n\nP.S. And it is just me or it looks like that 1x1 community is really no more? Or is it just Tumblr dash being buggy? I have tried to look around for 1x1 rps and it seems like that community is no longer existing? Just the same ten people in the tags.",

I also know that a lot of group rps recently suffered and took a massive toll with their advertisements because apparently you no longer can't link anything in your posts or it won't show up in the tags (?? what??).\n\nIt just makes me so freaking sad?? Because seriously I am willing to interact with anyone as long as you are not a creep or a predator or constant drama surrounds you. I try not to emerge myself in these. But I saw a tendency where the constant drama surrounds these 'few' people and the dash is full of that when you wake up. \n\nTbh, I am the type of person who will love any female character you can throw my way.  Plus size? YES, OF COURSE, FOREVER LOVE THEM. POC? ???? Is this even a question? Lmao. Overrated or underused face claim? Tbh I am not picky. You have a character that you always wanted to use against someone? GIMME! ! ! Because I will love them. \n\n!! If you ever want to, you can always PM me and we can talk and you can tell me your stories too :) \n\nWhere do people rp these days? :( I tried cherp most recently, I got like 4 responses to my plot idea and everyone ghosted me, c'est la vie. And I don't want to go on RP.me since I've had enough of one-liners and cybersex predators a while back ago.",
