            "body": "I did something similar about two years ago, early into having my main. The situations were different, but I got to a point where I realized that players were making so many demands about how to make the server \"better\" that it was completely different from the server I wanted to run. I removed roughly half the players, not for inactivity but because they made me feel too insecure to write in my own server. Because the situations are completely different and I know I've never done what you wrote about here, I know it's not the same server. I have, thankfully, grown to be better at just reaching out to players to say \"hey, I saw that you posted this and it honestly feels really insulting to the work my team and I put in. Would you mind being a little more mindful of your tone going forward?\"   \n\n\nBut that's a skill I needed to learn, and I'm sure others need to learn it too. I wonder if her reasons were what she gave or if she was just feeling targeted herself and went on a rampage.",

Pay in mind it's a server of roughly 15 people in, and everyone else apart 2/4 people have immortal characters, at best they would have ended up having 5 graves.\n\nUltimately I got banned and had to leave the server when I joined it back for April's fool just for a joke but then it turned serious since they most likely felt intimidated by solid suggestions to make the server better like reducing approvals since they are playing with a bulk as hell approval poll (7 admins has to say either yes or no before get approved and some are constantly afk) and so on.\n\nIn the end I got a good laugh for it, afterall that place is a dead wasteland anyway until they \"unfroze\" it as they said that themselves. \nBasically that place is dead until they say so, but if you say that is dead you aren't doing much to contribute. But you cannot RP in there. Basically it's a rp server without rp but hey guys \"it's not dead, but you aren't contributing so it's yours fault\" \n\nI still think these people do not deserve that place as they stole it from others, but at least, they are going to stay in their hole for a long while hopefully.",
