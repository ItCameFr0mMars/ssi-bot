            "body": "I appreciate the good faith attempt on your part to clarify what I mean and to invite further conversation. I'll try to return the good faith, and explain in detail where I'm coming from.\n\nPeople have a tendency to generalize their values and baselines as normative, and construct a conceptual framework that they try to map every other idea and experience on. In *The Moral Landscape*, Sam Harris begs us entertain a thought experiment.\n\nImagine that you plot all of human experience as a three dimensional space, with many peeks and valleys. Now, if you posit a scenario where every conscious being in the universe that *can* suffer, *does* suffer, and it suffers as much as its possible for its nervous system to render suffering in any meaningful sense, and this happens for as long as possible. And if there's no \"silver lining\" to this universe filled with only suffering, that this suffering isn't for any greater purpose, it isn't for any \"greater good\" with which you could attempt to justify it, well then you've effectively described a literal hell.\n\nNow, I surmise that you'd agree that *any* movement in *any* direction away from the bottom of this deepest \"valley\" in the map of all possible human experience, is a good one. Peaks in this space, contrasting valleys, would represent the height of positive, favorable experience for conscious minds such as ours, where the most number of needs are met, the most fulfilled lives, the most joy and rapture, the most satisfaction that its possible for minds such as ours to experience. Harris often uses this term, \"maximizing human well being\", which describes the project of mapping this abstract space, the peeks and valleys, to find the most optimal ones for the most number of people. He talks about this in his book, The Moral Landscape, and describes it as really as simple as a navigation problem.\n\nThere are many valleys and there are many peeks in this space. Some peaks are at equal altitudes, though at a different address in the space, with other peaks. I have to assume that, in good faith, you probably want everyone to get as close to a possible peak as they can. I believe in fact, that \"maximizing human well being\" is a project that, arguably, we all have a moral obligation, in some capacity, to contribute to, with whatever minor effort we can spare.\n\nNot all peaks look the same to all people, however. One particular peak doesn't describe a specific type of objective experience, in the objective physical world. It only describes the subjective experience of all the markers of well being, as *that* individual mind records the metrics of those data points, and it does so without assuming anything about how that experience is being created. An idyllic experience of maximal well being for a fish looks unrecognizable, to the point of being unmapable on any commonalities of experience, to the idyllic experience of a bird.\n\nWhat would one of the peaks in this space look like for a domestic dog? If you tried to map that onto a human's experience, it might share a lot of similarities with slavery and lack of agency. Different people value things like traditional gender roles, masculinity, femininity, honor, social currencies such as prestige and notoriety, etc, very differently from the way *other* people value them, and different cultures and sub-cultures have different subjective value frameworks for measuring \"life success.\" Klingons (StarTrek), though a fictional example, are not without narrative utility for reference. They value honor, perseverance, and strength. They engage in ritual demonstrations of overcoming adversity through stress and extreme pain to prove their worth through their strength of mind and body. Very much like some cultures right here at home on Earth, such as the Sater\u00e9-Maw\u00e9 tribe of Brazil who have a bizarre and [painful rite of passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEWmynRcEEQ) that all boys of the tribe must endure to be accepted as men.\n\nMerely due to the different way that someone else is *wired*, they could be experiencing a peak of experience, that ticks all their boxes of happiness and satisfaction, living optimally fulfilled lives, but to you, to your values and world model, it appears to be an abusive, dysfunctional relationship. And *to you*, it would be, because you have different values. You could *both* be standing on peaks, *different* peaks, but at *equal* altitudes.\n\nMy position, is that we should find our own peaks, and not begrudge others their own.",

            "body": "I respect that we disagree, but the downvote button, per site-wide Reddiquette, isn't a \"disagree\" button. It's purpose is to democratize moderation duties to the userbase, for the burying of spam, links to malicious websites, viral software, and off topic posts. This is none of those. It's *bad faith* to abuse it in a *good faith* conversation, where the *conversation itself* is of intrinsic value to projects of epistemological truth seeking, as we're doing here.\n\n*All* arguments are opposed. But, *not* all arguments are **adversarial**. It's possible (and preferable) to have *good faith* arguments of constructive intent, where both parties' goals are to cooperate in determining what is correct for mutual understanding. While some arguments are adversarial, where on some level the opposite position advocate is seen as an enemy in some conscious or subconscious capacity, constructive arguments should be based on good faith and conducted in observance of [*Rapoport's Rules to Criticize Someone Constructively*](https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/) (a series of axiomatic guidelines, much cherished by philosopher Daniel Dennett, for engaging in cooperative, rather than adversarial, argument), as well as the [*Twelve Virtues of Rationality*](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/) (by Eliezer Yudkowsky, which has a similar utility function, but serves as a great non-superfluous companion piece).\n\nThis is why I always upvote my argument partner, as a sign of respect, and a show of charitable good faith, that I see the intrinsic value in the truth seeking project of *conversation,* which is a gestalt form made of *both* party's contributions.\n\nThere's also the practice of \"Steel-manning\", which is juxtaposed to \"Straw-manning.\" In Straw-manning, the weakest possible \u2014 and often least probable \u2014 interpretation of someone's argument is attacked, often to the objection of its advocate, who's claims that \"that isn't what I meant\" are ignored. Steel-manning, on the other hand, is to extend the good faith practice of arguing against the *strongest*, most charitable interpretation of someone's argument. If the argument is being conducted in good faith as a genuine epistemological tooth seeking project, this practice is beneficial to both parties. A position's advocate may not express their position as well as possible, or perhaps they're so familiar with the position, that they have the assumption bias that their position is as obvious to everyone else as it is to them, and overlook articles in articulating their positions that would make understand accessible to others less familiar with it.\n\nThis is why Sam Harris states, *\"If you actually want to understand somebody's position, then you will always be interested in their efforts to clarify it.\"* This is beneficial in a number of ways. Firstly, it behooves honest truth seekers not to seek advantage in the failings of a position's advocate to properly describe the position, as those failings do not reflect logical or factual error in the position itself. Secondly, honest truth seekers should be as critical of their own position as they are of someone else's, as they do themselves -- and the project of truth seeking -- a disservice by not testing the merits of their position against the strongest version of a counter-position that may be a match for it.\n\nThough this process, good faith argument becomes a *co-operative* enterprise where both parties work together to find truth, an epistemological tide that raises all boats, rather than a zero sum game of adversarialism. Both parties can improve their understanding and sharpen the edges in their epistemological tool kit, while increasing the likelihood of arriving mutually at a more fundamental article of truth that they can both share. However, if one party practices a posture of good faith cooperative argument, and the other party practices a posture of bad faith adversarialism, there is an epistemological asymmetry that biases for the bad faith actor, to the deleterious effect of the truth seeking projects.",

            "body": "I hope the post is coherent. Your argument was well written, and I fear I might not able to provide an adequate reply at the moment. It\u2019s getting late and English is my second language, so I can feel my literacy abandon me with each minute that passes, haha. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to explain your points. I justwanted explained my position and asked you to clarify what part of my reply you were referring to. I\u2019m sorry if I gave you that impression!\n\nNow that I read your post, I can probably se eww have a misunderstanding. I am not attempting to shame people because they have different tastes, and I don\u2019t think there is a single model of relationship of culture. I agree people with different values can have different views. The reason I was referring to the relationships and interactions as abusive is because, in the context and lore of the story specifically, they were meant to be. The events held negative value. This was something that was discussed with the other writer while plotting and during the duration of the roleplay. Even by their admission, these experiences were supposed to be scary or unpleasant. \n\nSomething I noticed in some young writers (thankfully not many) and the thing I was referring to, is the romanticized idea abuse can be justified by love. The fact abuse is present is recognized, but it is also considered an expression of love or simple challenge. \n\nI have no issue with a character thinking that, and I think these can be interesting ideas to explore. My concern is when the lines between healthy fantasies and reality is blurred. Unfortunately, this belief can be dangerous when applied to the real world, as it can translates to tragedies. \n\nThe idea of young man or woman growing up thinking being threatened or hurt is a necessary and normal part of a relationship admittedly worries me. The reason is that, unfortunately, I had to watch my best friend struggle to free herself from a dangerous relationship, and I lost a classmate due a violent partner. I admit it\u2019s something that makes me a bit uneasy due to these experiences. \n\nBasically, I was talking about very, very specific situations. I\u2019m sorry if it sounded like I wanted to bash others or your opinion.",

            "body": "I get what you are trying to say, but I never had the feeling that any of the person's did that because they were romanticizing abuse or they thought that toxic relationships are cute (the characters were never in a romantic relationship at all, the story also did not include the character that was the victim of the abuse developing positive feelings of any kind for their abuser). It was more like...some weird kind of torture porn and sometimes almost like selfharm by creating a character that is so unloved that they never have anything good happening to them.\n\n As if they wanted to have a proof that everything in life is terrible and a person like themself will never be loved (for example, one guy wanted to write a character with a very prominent scar, and he always got angry when female characters were not disgusted by him and treated him as if he was subhuman).\n\nMy discomfort was mainly based on two things: these roleplays were boring as fuck because the reactions of their characters did not vary and there was no real story, and that I had the feeling that even though it was just roleplaying, I was somehow conforming their negative worldviews by making all my characters bully something that often seemed like a selfinsert.",
