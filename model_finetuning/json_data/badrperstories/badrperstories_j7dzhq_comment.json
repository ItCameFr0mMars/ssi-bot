Like there was nothing wrong with how she was before, why do we have to change her?\n\nAnd oh gooood those kinds of people are the worst to rp with because like, no matter what you do or how you describe your character they always ignore the things they don't like and focus on the stuff they do like and then times it by 10 when it's not true to your character. I've literally had some guy assume that my 6'7 average-muscular man character was an \"uwu soft boy\" who needed protection just because he was socially anxious despite me describing him the way he actually is canonically- like- why do people have to do that? There ain't anything wrong with having a character who is pudgy yet still strong! That kinda stuff is realistic, I'd say. Like why ignore important things? Because it makes you feel better?

I never want to really rp with someone who wants to change something about my character that makes 0 sense to change. Of course, I've written characters with more dark backstories, and if someone is uncomfortable with that I am either willing to change things or not bring it up in the rp- but like... I don't think my character's physical looks have anything to do with that so it's like idk, why change them?\n\nLiterally- I barely do smut or romance rps just because I have no interest in them- like, our characters are nothing but friends, or enemies, etc.- why does it matter so much as to why my character is considered \"ugly\" to you then? Yeah sure, in smut and romance you wanna find someone attractive- but like for anything else?? whyyyyy\n\nBut honestly, to all the people who do wanna rp with my characters for who they actually are- I gotta admit, those people are epic for not doing this kinda thing",

People have tried to push my OC's flaws and less (I guess) tolerable emotions into something more palpable for them. One of my oldest and beloved OC's is an abrasive person but because she's a she, the OC gets the uwu feisty treatment sometimes. Clear signals that my OC is uncomfortable and defensive? Nah, the other character is fine, it's just her being feisty. Manipulative trashbag OC? Well, cause that's a she, that's obviously gonna be a black widow archetype even if you specified that she despises that method.\n\nI've even had people try to force a really inhuman, creepy monster OC of mine into this weird na\u00efve monster plot line like they're Leeloo from the Fifth Element and not a fear eating creature with an identity crisis going on.\n\nIt's all weird but hey, at the very least, they're showing themselves off as questionable partners from the get go?
