Straightforward prose can be extremely effective in terms of keeping the reader invested. \n\nI will say, though, that I've had plenty of RP partners who would change their tenses to match mine, or I've done the same in return. I prefer at least that, because then it keeps the RP reading more consistently. I've also seen RPers who will write in more paragraph-like format or more shorthand action-based format depending on their partner's style, and this is more so for the sake of sticking with the rhythm and pacing of the RP. As long as it works and it's legible, I'd say no harm in trying to fit the style that seems to be best serving the RP scenario. Some RP scenes are more actiony and fast-paced while others may be a little more meandering and introspective.",

She came from a supernatural board (genre, not the show) and had now made her own board centred around a fandom that wasn't super popular on Jcink at the time, but the idea was unique and I joined her board. (The kind of people who are into the supernatural genre on Jcink tend to be the most toxic in my experience, but she didn't give off that vibe. At first anyway.)\n\nHer posts were just a big flood of how in love her character was with this other mod's character. They were friends and had a ship together, which would have been fair enough if she could fucking write about something other than her character being *soooooo* in love with this other character. That was her character's whole personality. Being in love. I kid you not, out of 1000+ words, her post would have maybe one or two lines for my character to react to. Receiving posts from her was not a feeling of \"Yay, a new post to respond to!\" but rather, \"Ugh, this bullshit again\" and I would often put off responding to her for days because I couldn't be bothered.\n\nThe worst part was that she was so up and mighty about how good of a writer she was and she really wasn't. I hated her writing. One time she told me how there had been an anon complaints box on the supernatural board she used to be on, where members could submit their complaints and suggestions to the board anonymously. A large portion of the submissions to this box was people saying how much they hated her writing and she tried to make me feel sorry for her. I did, I really didn't want to get dragged into her drama and I just wanted to remain friends. But behind my monitor, even while we were on good terms, part of me couldn't help but think, \"But they're not wrong.\"",

Doesn't mean it's 100k words, just means it moves the plot forward and is legible.\n\nPurple prose - we've all gone through this phase - seems like that awkward medium writer stage. You've got the vocabulary and you've got the grammar - however the structure still eludes you and you're not sure if what you're saying is necessary or not but you want to get your ideas out.",
