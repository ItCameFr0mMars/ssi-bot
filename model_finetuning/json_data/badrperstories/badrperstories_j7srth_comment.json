            "body": "You likely won't like my take on the situation.\n\nIt sounds like your friend has found someone they really click with and all of their energy, enthusiasm and roleplay juice is going into that person. Chances are that they clicked because of lots of factors, but one of them might be that they respond at the same rate. That's really important for roleplay, pacing between partners, and you having a slower pace is *not a bad thing* but it does mean that not everyone will match that pace. The same thing goes for people who prefer a quicker pace. \n\nYour friend likely still cares about you, still sees you as a friend, but you two are growing apart and chances are very low that you can 'fix' this as long as she and the other partner are still clicking so well together. You can and should talk to her, but go into it with that mindset and don't expect things to get back to how they were just like a snap. They *can* get back there possibly later down the line, but it would need to happen organically and likely as other circumstances change independent of things you can choose and do. I've had a few roleplay partners where our dynamics waxed and waned over time and with various factors (their job hours, my job hours, maybe they got into a relationship, just various life influences, other writing partners and desires etc), and that's okay. \n\nYou should go into the talk and express your feelings without any guilt-tripping language, and you should be supportive of your friend in every way. If it's something you can be okay with and something you want to hear and be involved in, you could tell her that you understand and want to support her, and still want to hear about her other roleplays with her new partner if being left out of hearing that sort of thing is something you don't want. They likely purposefully didn't tell you because they know it would upset you and they didn't want to make you feel bad about things. *It is okay though* if you aren't in an okay place where you welcome hearing that sort of thing while you basically get left behind. It's okay to not be okay with that, but know that it does mean you will become more distant. In your shoes I don't think I would be okay with hearing about it, at least not right away but some people are and honestly I wish I was like that.\n\nMy advice to you is to start searching for a new partner again. Purposefully move yourself and your thoughts away from keeping tabs on your friend's activity in her server. *Stop* doing that, it is only hurting you. Go and look for a new RP group all on your own to join maybe, make new roleplay friends of your own completely separate from your other friend. Don't do it spitefully, but do it for yourself. Force your thoughts away from worrying about what she's doing and if she's wanting to write with you. Take a step back yourself and get your head on straight. You are lower on her priorities now, so you should adjust your priorities regarding her, too because having someone higher on your priorities while you are lower on theirs *hurts*. That doesn't need to be a spiteful or angry thing, don't cut her off or get angry, but accept things as they are, and realize you have the power to meet new people as well, and to not wallow in worrying when she will look your way. You deserve a new writing partner of your own that you click with in the way she clicks with this new person as well. Don't let yourself miss out on finding that person by not even looking or being open to it while you're floating in a holding pattern waiting for scraps from someone that has their focus elsewhere.",

Of course, that's not a bad thing, but you're right. She definitely likes things fast paced from what I have seen and there is nothing wrong with that! \n\nI think more so, the main reason why I'm hurt is due to the fact that she is a very close friend of mine. I could give two craps about the roleplay, but the fact she has been also ignoring our conversations, which are quite pleasant, is what is getting to me. \n\nAlthough I appreciate your response so much. I'm going to see if I could just end the roleplay and stay a friend to her\nI still love her with all of my heart, and I'll never ever be  angry at her. :) Seeing her get excited about roleplays is very nice, haha! \n\nAgain, thanks so much! I appreciate you and have a great rest of your day/night!",

I wonder if she's maybe tied up in knots a bit and feels guilty about the roleplay side of your dynamic going poorly due to her dropping the ball with it, and she's defaulting into avoiding those feelings entirely which has meant talking to you less in general. Then she likely feels guilt over *that* and the avoidance spirals. It's definitely a cycle I've seen in many people before, and a hard one to break from the inside.\n\nI hope your talk with her goes well, you sound so understanding and like a really decent person overall. Hope you have a wonderful day/night as well, and that things all sort out in a way that leave you and your friend feeling good about the whole situation!",

It was fun! Time passed and we started a new roleplay forum, and I had felt singled out. The other members seemed to be doing stuff together, but I suddenly felt like there was no room for me. Even that same friend wasn't down to do our usual character relationship. \n\nMore time had passed, and it has now gotten to a point where it's pretty evident that a clique was formed in the group. It was my friend and several other writers, then the rest of us. Me and two other friends in the group had felt singled out, as if the others didn't really care about us. I'm still in touch with one fellow guy, and the other person had focused her attention on other groups. \n\nThe group had become inactive for a while, so it allowed me to focus on other groups. I can safely say that I am currently part of another group that is very close to me and doesn't single me out. \n\nI just think you should try to do the same. \n\nRecently, the group became active again, but I haven't really paid much attention to what they are saying. It's usually about BTS, Glee or their ships. None of which I am interested in, so I just stopped looking at their discord channel.",
