Your message was incredibly polite and respectful, and if something as simple as that is why they decided not to roleplay with you, I don't think it would have lasted long anyways. It's a big red flag to me that they couldn't take criticism, especially considering you're a member of the culture that they're appropriating! You deserve a partner who listens to what you have to say.\n\nI'm 25, and I started rping when I was eight. No matter how old people are, some don't take criticism well, or think that their ideas are above reproach. That isn't your fault. You aren't wrong to feel upset, but it's always good to temper your expectations with new partners. As this sub shows, there's a lot of crazies out there. Luckily, your guy was civil about breaking things off, but even if they hadn't been, it still wouldn't have been your fault. You two weren't a good match, and it's better to break things off now.\n\nAnd it's certainly not wrong to be upset when your culture is reduced to \"ooooooh spooky scary monsters!!\" There's a difference between appreciating another culture's folklore and stripping away all of the pesky cultural context because you want a scary story. There are ways, as an outsider, to do things respectfully and \"native americans aren't important to the plot\" ain't it.",

            "body": "Here are my two cents, take them as you will. The Wendigo has become pretty popular icon in horror culture recently so perhaps they're unaware of the origins. There have been movies and videogames popping up. They might just think the creature is really cool from one of those outlets and they're allowed to think that. I don't expect my partners to be an expert in what they want to RP. I don't think it is disrespectful at all. \n\nAlso, the Wendigo, from my understanding, originates from a specific First Nations tribe/region and I apologise for not remembering their name or region. I also don't know if you're apart of that tribe but from your post (which is all I have to go off of) is giving me the impression you're insinuating that such a creature is apart of all First Nations folklore. There are many great and unique tribes in North America with vastly different cultures, as I'm sure you know. I've spoken with a few members from First Nations tribes and never once have they reacted as you have when talking about their folklore. They were usually pretty enthusiastic about sharing their culture!\n\nI believe you have every right to voice your concerns and speak up for your heritage and they had every right to turn you down. While it would be nice to include real life cultural references in the RP, it sounds like they just want horror and weren't signing up for anything more. While I don't think you overreacted, you came off as a bit combative and accusing even though you said you weren't. I was certainly turned off from your comments.\n\nEdit: changed US to North America. Can't forget about our neighbors!",

What you SHOULD have done is asked whether it would be cool with them to introduce characters and then made Native american characters if you wanted representation, not preach to him that she should add that ***if*** *you wanted to play that prompt*.   \n\n\nSince you seemingly didn't want to play that prompt in the first place, lecturing him about it was unnecessary and probably annoyed him. Telling an RPer what to or how to play is not looked upon favourably. Secondly RPers also do not like people who didn't seem to have properly read the ad or try to change the original prompt and people in general don't like being preached too; So when you decided to essentially lecture the man on how he should have representation in the way **you** saw fit it probably lit up some red flags then you could be a controlling or annoying partner, or someone who is SJW and thus gets offended easily.  \n\nYoung men and the internet do not have good opinions about SJWs so that probably turned them off. I as 19 year old dude avoid them like the plague because I don't fancy being called a bigot over minor shit nor do I want to be told on what or how I can play.  If you wanted representation you should either made your own prompt or made some characters yourself. You're not \"educating\" them, you're being annoying. If you don't like then ignore it and mind your own business. \n\nI viewed your second post as well and as far as I can tell you didn't mention that you wanted to play the prompt and instead wanted to play the other prompts  so there was no point in telling him what you did. Lastly you alone do not represent your culture, You get whether others in your culture would be offended. When culture is shared to an outsider then it is bound to get bastardized and there is no way to avoid that.",

RP/Writing is passion based and can be deeply personal. You guys hadn't established a friendship yet where they were comfortable or receptive with your critiques. It sucks, but I wouldn't put much weight in that, much less want to cry over it, given what a tool they sound like. There are other, not marginalized cultures with very similar creatures in their mythos, but he had to take something from a group that is still to this day facing genocide in some parts of the world and then scrub away the history behind it?\n\nGenocide isn't just killing people, it's removing them of their history and culture so it's like they didn't exist in the first place. Maybe I'm a little more sensitive to this because I share the culture so I'm seeing it a little more politically, but you seem to share those views yourself. It sucks to get excited about a story only to have it yanked away, but I'm proud of you for saying something. I'm willing to bet your ancestors would be too. People take a lot of creative liberties in RP. I'm 32, and I've only just begun to stand my ground with these things because it's *not okay.* I started roleplaying when I was 12, and I can tell you that up until 3 years ago, I was too afraid of upsetting people to speak up when bullshit like this happened. RP has been white washed for decades. That's why I'm so proud of you, whoever you are, wherever you are, whichever nation you come from. You're so young, and you're braver than I was.\n\nAnd, if you're on Discord at all, [Roleplay Factory](https://discord.gg/2SeDpWy) is a hub server run by PoCs who promote stories also run by PoCs who push a more diverse narrative. Best wishes, love, and luck to you, OP.",
