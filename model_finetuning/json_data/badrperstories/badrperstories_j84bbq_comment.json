Of being called \"petty\" or other horrible things. Then i realized thats what they want me to be silent so i shared hopefully others will speak up about abusive toxicity in their games rps what have you. The site they frequented honestly should just be shut down now. Theres rampant toxicity, encouragement of rps that encourage illegal activities, and rp ads that promote negative things. Theres no action taken against users that break rules some just make another account. Which is why i left. ERP/RP can be enjoyable if everyone follows boundaries really just using common sense.",
