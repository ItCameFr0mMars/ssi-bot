She is not your friend, instead she has used you as her emotional punching bag, real friends do not minimize your problems for their own. I take it her so called past friends wised up and left they realize she was just using them for her own gain. \n\nI say continue the distance she has imposed, play into it until you are safe and sure she will not retaliate for you dropping her. If you wish to stay in this community be civil use her own words against her. Be polite, it's much easier to feed the beast then try to fight it when you know you have a disadvantage.  Just say you two have grown apart and that is true to some extent you've had enough of her treatment of you but do not let that slip. \n\nPeople grow and change, start to surround yourself with better people who care about you but also be prepared to leave this community unfortunately if it comes down to that.",
