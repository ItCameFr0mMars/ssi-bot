            "body": "This- I was actually plotting on posting in this subreddit what I'm about to type out! (Who knows, maybe I will, later.)\n\nStill, I'll give you a basic rundown. When I first started RP'ing, I had three people I RP'd with CONSTANTLY. I've already mentioned one in the past, this focuses on the other.- All of us were in the RPs for the ships (which is my personal preference for RPs and was their's as well, so we all got along). This one person would RP as Frisk from Undertale, and... Guess what?\n\nEvery RP, no matter how fluffy it was supposed to be- they would eventually suddenly make their character sadistic, their character would go on a violent rampage, and the RP would end with either the character suddenly turning away from everything they did and fixing everyone (forgiven, of freakin' course) or every other character would be brutally murdered/tortured/etc., within an inch of their life.- I let this happen in EVERY RP for a solid YEAR.- Eventually I just drifted away from it, and now I freak out anytime the mere CONCEPT of torture comes up in an RP, because I'm freaked I'll enter another year-long gore-fest where I can't get any fluff-time with my ships without them all being brutally and sadistically murdered.\n\n... We don't really talk anymore... And I let that go on WAY longer than I should have.- Suffice to say, dark topics in RPs... Tend to wig me out and I run from them, these days. Too many bad memories...\n\nI also remember a time their character DIED,- naturally, my character did not cause it- and Frisk's family blamed MY CHARACTER for the death, despite knowing the facts. I had my character commit suicide (again, really dark year in my life- I don't RP these subjects anymore) and when they asked why (for Primus' sake man, you turned the world against my character after a death- that wasn't even their fault and they already blamed themselves for what occurred). I responded with how my character felt unneeded, unwanted, and how they had been blamed for a death that was *in no way their fault*. Their characters all 'suddenly' had a change of heart, revived mine, and they tried to get a happy-sappy ending. I refused because my character had committed SUICIDE and their character was DEAD, and happy endings don't just come at the drop of a hat.\n\nI really should've stopped RP'ing with them sooner, before we got so entrenched in the madness... But yeah. My fault for not saying 'no' sooner.- Suffice to say... It was a year of roleplays that started good, and ended in death. ***Constantly***.",

            "body": "A bunch of people I know IRL started a small Discord server a while back. There were only maybe like, 8 people in it. One of my friend\u2019s younger cousins ended up joining, which was fine\u2014 the more the merrier\u2014 but as soon as we started getting into the nitty gritty of the plot, she started to become a little annoying. I don\u2019t really like combat to begin with, but she made it so much worse. First, she\u2019d boss everyone around, telling them to distract the enemy while she goes in and does all the fighting. Then, once she defeated said enemy, she\u2019d have a severe injury, so we\u2019d all have to fawn over her and make sure she was alright before we could move on. This happened many, MANY times and after a while, the fact that she was getting hurt was a huge burden on the story. Not to mention she also controlled people\u2019s characters and wrote lots of lines that no one could go off of. I\u2019m surprised nobody spoke up about it OOC, because it definitely wasn\u2019t just me who was noticing a problem.",

I don't know if this qualifies for this subject, it's actually a positive story.\n\nI was writing a scene with someone once with our two male characters just being dudes, drinking beers and hanging out by the lake. My buddy's character threw a beer at mine in one post. In the next post, the character threw a beer at mine again. My buddy had completely forgotten about the first beer. I knew they were kind of a stoner and something like that would easily slip while under the influence so I shot my buddy a message and asked them if they meant to do that to give them a chance to change their post. Their response? \"nah man, just go with it.\" so I did and my character was confused about the multiple beers being tossed at him.\n\nFucking loved that moment, one of my favourites ever. Could have just ignored it and let them get away with the slip up, but ended up with a favourite moment instead.\n\nOn a similar note, in my early rp days, I once experienced someone's character sitting down, standing up, sitting down, standing up and sitting down again over the span of multiple posts. It was so stupid, I just ended up leaving.",

            "body": "There was a guy I found on a forum RP site whose story ideas were so perfectly matched with my muse, and then I saw his writing (because you can look through people's other stories there) and he was a phenomenal writer.   \n\n\nI think I was checking daily at one point to see if he was off hiatus and accepting new partners because he was the first and really the only writer I found on there that wasn't like a \"yeah okay we can try something out\" type of deal. Like, I was soooo amped to be able to write with him.   \n\n\nAny way, we hashed out a story and started. I started us off. His post basically just rewrote my post I guess the way he would have preferred it had gone. Usually NPCing my characters is a huge no, but I let it go thinking maybe it was just for the intro. Second post comes around, same thing - he just erased my whole post to tell me what *actually* happened, down to what my character was seeing, feeling, thinking, and doing but also including actions of other NPCs I'd written in.  \n\n\nI messaged him and asked him to stop doing that, please, at that point. He was surprised and apparently didn't realize he'd been doing it. Third post rolls around - he does it again. I tell him, I'm not feeling it and make up some excuse about switching platforms. He followed me to Discord and asked to pick it back up. I was hesitant, but I decided to give it another shot. Fourth through tenth post - he does it. At that point, you could have deleted every single one of my posts and the story would have been super fluid and completely written by him writing both of our characters. I gave up, thanked him for his time, but said that I wouldn't be writing with him anymore and why. He, again, was surprised but he accepted it.   \n\n\nOddly, every single writing partner I've had from that site does this to a degree. My current writing partner also came from there, but thankfully they only needed to hear me say \"please stop playing my characters\" once to stop doing it. We've been writing stories together for over a year now.",

Instead his character attacked mine, beat them up, pinned them to the ground, and put their own gun to their head - all in one post, in which he specifically said my character was taken by surprise by the attack and was trapped on the ground before they had a chance to fight back. Should have told him to fuck off then and there but I replied several more times after that and even agreed to other threads with him. Why, I have no idea, even several years later. That definitely wouldn't fly with me today, I'd cut them off first time it happened and not look back. The weird shit we do when we first start roleplaying... \n\nThere was also the person who promised they could do weekly (or faster) posts consisting of four-five paragraphs minimum. Instead they gave me one or two paragraphs once a month. I believed them saying they'd start posting faster for about six months until they eventually admitted they'd lied to me about their post speed and length because they wanted to write with me. I gave them another two months to turn it around before leaving the group. Apparently they got super upset about me 'walking out on them' and ended up leaving the group too, blaming it on me not being patient enough with them.",

So me and my RP partner would agree on a time to be online, then we'd sit down and RP out a whole scene via chat, and that's how we'd get the overall plot moving along. So our responses generally averaged about 5 - 10 minutes at a time because we still wrote in small-ish paragraphs. But over a course of months, my RP partner's replies were getting slower and slower. Sometimes it would be a whole 30 - 40 minutes before they'd drop their next reply in the chat. I didn't want to be pushy, so I'd let it slide and just reply once their reply finally came. \n\nOne particular night, their replies were coming slow again. Then after one of my replies, I waited... and waited... and waited... an hour went by. Two hours. Three hours. Finally, around the fourth hour, my RP partner finally replied and followed it up with an OOC comment that said \"Sorry, went on a drive to the beach with my friends\" (she lives near the shore). \n\nLike... if she was going to up and leave like that, she could have dropped a note in the chat like \"hey, I'm stepping out, let's continue this later\". But instead, I sat there and waited the whole time and she wasn't even around. \n\nI didn't make a stink about it or anything because I didn't even send any \"hey you still there?\" type of messages while she was out, but I do really wish she'd at least have thought to let me know she was going to be AFK for a while.",
