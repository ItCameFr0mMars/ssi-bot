I believe it's called the \"Yes, *and*\" method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough it sounds like your problem is more just inability to accept the other person's wishes. I don't really have advice for that, I played with someone like you and ended up cutting contact because they would shut down all of my ideas and then make *me* feel like a godmodding villain for daring to be upset, so uhhh maybe try to check if you're not doing that? Compromise, don't blame the other person for something you disagree with. \n\nAlso keep in mind that the fact they are discussing things with you is already not a rejection, they want to make things work!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally what you're describing as stopping communication sounds like ghosting, and that is very much not cool and possibly the real dealbreaker here. Try putting yourself in the other person's shoes - would you prefer radio silence, or getting even a little ooc update? I'm not sure what platforms you roleplay on, but on my place there's a lot of people who are older or have mental health problems, so a quick message \"hey I really don't have the mental capacity this week, replies will have to wait\" usually takes care of it and lets your partners know what to expect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if any of this will be helpful to you, but good luck!",

I am unsure what to do with those who stay or what else to say after that. Youre suggestion to hear out their preferences first so I can build my thoughts around it is a really good idea. Most people press me for my interests, and I guess common ground is their goal? I just feel like there's no point in offering anything if I cannot offer everything I am looking for.   \n\n\nI know that's wrong thinking.

If you've never heard the term, there's a great article about it on goodtherapy.org. Roleplays fall through. It happens. It isn't always or even most of the time personal or a reflection on you! The other person may not have the spoons for an RP right now, or for the level of commitment you're looking for. \n\nI honestly think working on the rejection aspect will help in more places than just roleplay.",

            "body": "I wanted to echo what u/melody_spectrum said about using the \"Yes, and\" method. It's popular amid the Improv crowd, but since roleplay is basically improvised writing, I've always found it a helpful model to go by. Essentially, you just try and incorporate and build off of your partner's ideas, and vice versa. Look for the common ground and try to use what nuggets of ideas you can (within reason, of course -- you may not be able to say yes to *everything* and still come up with a coherent plot, but it can be a fun way to brainstorm where you just throw everything at the fence and see what sticks). \n\nIt might be helpful for you to try it out. And definitely encourage your partner(s) to offer up their own ideas, so that you can make it more of a shared, collaborative effort. They'll have more invested if they get to take an active role in brainstorming and laying out ideas ahead of time.\n\nI would also encourage you to communicate about your own particular challenges (the learning disability, time it takes to compose posts, energy necessary, etc). It could be easy for your partners to misconstrue such things to indicate a lack of interest. Maybe if you state them up front, that can help offset misunderstandings down the line.\n\nIn any case, good luck! Collaborative writing/roleplay is sort of its own special little niche of writing, with its own rules and ways to navigate through things, and it all kind of depends on the partner(s) you find. I hope you find some that can inspire you and energize you instead of sapping your creativity. That's when the magic happens!",

Your partner will bring ideas to the table that you never thought of, and provide an unpredictability that can keep things compelling. \n\nIt may be that you'll need to indulge your more controlling side through solo writing, where everything can be laid out just the way you want it. But with roleplay, it's supposed to be a shared effort, so if that's truly what you want, you may have to learn to appreciate the benefits of sacrificing a few of your ideas and embracing someone else's, or at least incorporating them into a cohesive whole that's a blend of your vision and theirs.",
