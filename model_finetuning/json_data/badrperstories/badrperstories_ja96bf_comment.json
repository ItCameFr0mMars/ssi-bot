            "body": "RP communities can be very tumultuous. They don't start out that way, but when you gather more and more people who have more varied personalities, then eventually drama is going to strike. Snd the longer the drama is allowed to simmer, the closer it gets to blowing the lid right off the pot.\n\nThroughout my years of roleplay, I have seen RP communities absolutely tear their members apart. I have seen people get pretty and backstab each other. I have seen bullying and witch hunting. I have seen people form cliques and oust other members for petty reasons. \n\nAnd these people were all in their 20s. RP communities for whatever reason can get nasty. I hate to say so, but some of the most toxic communities I have ever witnessed have been RP communities. Take from that what you will.\n\nThat said, I think it is a rough gig sometimes for people who deal with mental illness. They look to RP as a means of escape and solace but soon find out that the rest of the community has different ideas and goals in mind... I think RP van be kind of like social media. It can be fun but it gets stressful to the point that you may either need to take a break or leave it behind altogether...\n\nThis is all to say that, fun and creative a hobby as it can be, I would caution people who struggle with mental illness to be wary when diving into RP as a hobby. You can come across great partners and create great collaborations of work, but the risk of drama is always going to be there, too. At a certain point, you have to weigh the pros and cons and determine how much stamina you might have for it. \n\nFor those who enjoy writing, I would suggest feeding that interest. Solo writing, beginning that big project, you first novel, can be an incredibly creative outlet. Getting feedback from writers workshops and the like can help you to grow and refine your craft even more. It's not entirely collaborative, but once you funnel yourself into that flow of creativity, it can be rewarding enough in its own right.\n\nAll in all, sorry you got caught up in that kind of turbulence... take what time you need to recover. And don't give up on your writing. RP may not be the right vessel for it, but that doesn't mean you have to stop writing for good.",

            "body": "Here's what I've learned, and it's helped me.   \nYou can't throw a rock in the RP community without hitting someone who is either learning disabled, physically disabled, or has a mental health disorder. I would go so far as to say every single role player ever has had at least one of those, but usually it's 2/3.   \nWhen I first realized that, there was a moment of \"I'm not special.\" At least, in that, I'm genuinely not, which means, respectfully, you aren't either. None of us are in that regard.   \nBut a more positive spin on that is \"I'm not alone.\"   \n\n\nIf you can get yourself to understand that every single person you interact with when role playing is going through something similar if not the exact same thing as you are, at the exact same time, then you're on the right path to doing something about it. But what you can't do is use it as a crutch that you give to say \"I acted like this because I have this disorder/disability.\" Your disorder is yours to manage, just like all of ours are ours to manage, and we're all doing the best we can.   \n\n\nFor me, it was recognizing not only my triggers but also in understanding my moods, and then communicating those openly to role players that I interact with. If we're all going through it in some capacity, then there is no shame whatsoever in saying \"can we pick this up later, I'm having an episode\" or \"you've just triggered one of my boundaries, I need to go cool off,\" or even \"these are my triggers, please respect them, avoid when you can, warn me when you can't.\"   \n\n\nEver since I adopted that habit, I haven't had these issues. I took the first step with my group, and since then we've all been very open about messaging one another to say a quick \"hey I know you probably didn't mean to be malicious, but I internalized your words or actions in this way. Would you mind talking to me about this?\"   \n\n\nA mature person with even a dose of compassion will hear that and reroute. If someone doesn't, you can fairly safely assume that they're not mature enough to handle their own emotions, so they're projecting them onto you. Similarly, you also need to understand that someone else's reaction to you might be because they are internalizing or misreading something you've said. We should all just be more mindful of how we communicate online, because without our voices or our faces to show our emotions, it's easy to misread something. In that, I would add : Practice Patience, with yourself, and with your fellow writers.",

Being interrogated after things have boiled behind the scenes without me knowing just puts me on edge. It's like accidentally eating your roommate's snack and thinking nothing of it only to be bombarded a week later about how greedy and messed up you are. \n\nI wholeheartedly accept that I have problems. I see doctors, I take medication, I do my best to walk away when I feel I can't control myself, and I make it known that I have these issues so people know that they may need to be a bit blunt and just tell me if there is a problem. I can't do anything if people don't give me a chance to fix it. \n\nI've realized that people rather get angry and yell first and then be understanding later. You can't corner someone with a group of people and not expect them to get upset or try to defend themselves. I don't hate anyone that was involved in the drama with me. It just hurt. It hurt more than I'd really like to admit. I'm not an overly trusting person and all this just makes me want to keep my distance even more.\n\nThank you for your advice, I'll do my best to keep it in mind for the future.",
