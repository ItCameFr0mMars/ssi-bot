            "body": "I feel like I've met this person.   \nSomeone really similar came into my server some months back. Immediately, they gave me a laundry list of ways to \"improve\" my server, even going so far as to say that our dice system was like a \"tattoo on the ass of the supermodel\" that my server otherwise would be.   \n\n\nI will truly never understand the logic or the sense of entitlement some people have when they join a group. I use the party analogy a lot. Where it's like I'm throwing a party and this random person off the street comes in, I'm not going to turn them away and maybe we'll all have fun. But instead of enjoying the party, they just immediately start telling me that my curtains are hideous, my furniture is all wrong, my bean dip sucks. On one hand - nobody fucking asked for that opinion. On the other hand - if the party sucks so much, why stay? Plenty of other people are enjoying themselves, so clearly it's not everyone that shares this one party pooper's opinion.   \n\n\nSimilarly, this person also made it seem like it was my job and my staff's job to figure out an arc for their character when all of their play had been purely about dismantling the system the whole premise was built on. It's very much like a child who doesn't understand why their parents enjoy playing chess, so they throw a tantrum and break the board.   \n\n\nIt's okay to struggle with a muse. I am happy to help players brainstorm ideas. But for that to happen, players need to come to me and clearly say \"I'm struggling with this, can you help me?\" Coming to the Admin's DMs with some variation of \"I'm struggling and it's your fault, fix this\" is probably the easiest way to get tossed out of the \"party\" on your entitled ass.",

            "body": "That\u2019s why we ban as fast as possible. If someone has a track record of good behavior, they\u2019re less likely to get an immediate ban for one mistake. \n\nHowever, when someone joins and creates trouble, we establish a warning. If someone does not heed that warning, it is a mute. If that mute doesn\u2019t work, it is a ban. We ban for disrespect and disruptive behaviour immediately. It\u2019s a hard fandom to run around in but we don\u2019t reward Main Character Syndrome. \n\nAdmittedly I was stuck in a Roleplay with two lower-tier roleplayers. Nothing to be ashamed of regarding one lining until you get something that makes no sense and is not explained whatsoever. Instead of punishing them OOC, I chose to do so IC. \n\nIt was a basic mission. Three Genin, one package, a delivery to the other side of Kirigakure nine island hops away. Simple enough, right?\n\nThe second the courier who was giving us directions handed us the map, one of the people rejected it. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m super good at sensory stuff, I can find my way.\u201d\n\nProblem is that finding your way is different than knowing your destination. It was the single-handedly most stupid thing I had ever heard as he didn\u2019t have the Byakugan (which would make it a little more believable) and he had no sensory techniques that I was aware of, or anything that was on his character application. \n\nSo. My character noticed this, figured that he was bullshitting. She\u2019s a bit of a bully, so she can be mean at times. She picked up the map and noticed that it was on the other side of Kiri, far away from Kumo. To test if he knew what he was doing, she said, \u201cWe have to go to Kumogakure. That\u2019s where the map says we need to go.\u201d\n\nNeither of them had looked at the map. It hadn\u2019t even said Kumogakure in the previous DM post. I had made the DM aware that I wanted to derail the mission (she is a sweetheart, she gave me full permission and set to working on a different type of challenge to put us through) and she greenlit that. \n\nNeither of them were aware that Kumogakure, was, in fact, the opposite of the area we were supposed to go. This is a simple package delivery mission and yet somehow my character was able to mislead both of them and send them in an entirely different direction. \n\nWe\u2019re just about to head out. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store, but I told the DM to make it challenging! Nothing like a difficult mission to make people think twice about pretending to know information they had no way of knowing.",
