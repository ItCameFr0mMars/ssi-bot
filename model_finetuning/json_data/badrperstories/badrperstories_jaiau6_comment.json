Fundamentally, people who are 'good partners' and will put in effort would want to communicate with you anyway, and those who are 'bad partners' are probably less likely to read or care about your rules.\n\nAll you can do is start talking with someone, and if it doesn't work, stop. Adding endlessly more rules and requirements will do nothing to exclude those who don't read them, and will put off an ever-increasing proportion of those who you would actually want to interact with.\n\nSeriously, if they start responding with 'k' then you've barely put any time into the interaction. Cut your losses, and walk away - if not right there, then shortly later if they don't improve things. If you know they won't end well, or it doesn't feel right, just don't do it - the power is entirely within your hands.",

E.g rather than me saying I dislike roleplayers that only focus on their main character, I'd talk about how I love roleplayers that enjoy creating a large cast with me.\n\nPeople that resonate with that will be excited to talk to you!\n\nIn contrast, talking about what you don't want doesn't really get anyone excited and may, fairly or not, lead them to judge you in an unflattering way. Related: capslock is a bad impression as it makes you look, perhaps, over the top.\n\nYou mentioned finding it tough to end roleplays. I get it, it's a bit awkward, but it gets easier the more you do it and realise \"woo, I'm free of obligations!\" When I do this, I stick to a very short message.\n\nJust something like \"Thanks for reaching out and taking the time to plot with me, but this isn't flowing as I'd hope so I'd rather not start a roleplay - all the best in your search\" and only a slight change of wording if already roleplaying.\n\nYou do *not* need to explain your reasons or thinking at all; if someone is going to take rejection badly or not, outside of you being rude/polite, it doesn't make a difference if your reason was \"good\" or not.",
