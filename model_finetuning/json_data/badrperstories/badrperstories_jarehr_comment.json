            "body": "Are you talking about 1x1 rping community on the tumblr?\n\nFirst of all, I am very sorry to hear that you've had such an experience. \n\nBut this doesn't surprise me a tiny bit. Even 5 years ago, 1x1 rp community was ***exactly*** like this. People would message or like your post for a plotting and when you approach them, it doesn't go anywhere else besides a plot exchange or the character ideas. Plus, a lot of people are very nitpicky about face claims and seems to  care about them a lot more than the actual character you interested in playing.\n\nAnd whenever it moves to roleplaying phase, a starter or one reply in and the person ghosts you. And then 2 weeks later a random blog pops up in your dashboard, getting you thinkin' all \"hmm, what just happened because I don't remember myself following this person\" and then you learn that one of your partners changed their blog to a different character and starting a differnt roleplay with somebody else\n\nBy the way, do you know the reason why your blog was shadowbanned? I am very curious. I am trying to get back into tumblr rping within a couple of weeks (and even has 2 blogs in a preparation), so I want to know what to avoid. But I also have heard that one of the problems why your post doesn't show up in the tags- it is because your post may consist a link. Beware of that! \n\nI am returning to the indie side. But my previous tries was very overwhelming. I feel like all what people care is about a face claim. It left me super icky. I really wish that people cared more about a character and the backbone they carry with them.",

The face claim thing is so accurate, honestly unless you\u2019re using Dove Cameron or some person from Euphoria or something, they basically want nothing to do with you. On average, if you want to play older characters, they want nothing to do with you either. They\u2019re definitely more invested in the faces as opposed to the content of the character.\n\nI have ZERO clue why I was shadowbanned, I don\u2019t have any flags on that account, it hasn\u2019t been censored by their tyrannical TOS, and up until several weeks ago all my posts were showing up in the attached tags.

            "body": "Dove Cameron is still popular in 2020???  asoidjsaodijsad I guess it shows how much I am living in a cave.\n\nI am not sure what kind of face claims you use- but I love to use kpop face claims, and it is tough. I do love to mix in Western underrated face claims that I don't ever see being used around- and I can see how little people want to write with me. It doesn't receive just as much attention, even if it is male characters, too. But if, for example, I choose someone like Chris Evans or Tom Holland - numerous inquiries are in line.\n\nAgreed with the older characters so much. I feel like I have reached that age where I no longer find it super interesting to play 18 years old anymore.  So I want to explore more choices for mid-20s, 30s. I feel like there is so much untapped potential.  \n\nI am also not the biggest fan of smut-based plots, where it is not even important to me. But even if I state that in my rules, people will outright message me and suggest smutty plots, also right away throwing myself at certain characters (with certain face claims). I also mention that I won't write it unless our characters have interacted before and I know what kind of a relationship they possess. \n\nThis is so weird. I recently made a blog for one of my indies. When I changed my email, I ran into an issue where my askbox stopped working and error would pop up. I messaged them about this and they said that there is a glitch coming from their system, they fixed afterwards.\n\nBut my posts don't show up in the tags at all, even if cheezbot liked one of them (llol). \n\nThis is the problem. Everyone seems to be interested in rping. But when it reaches that point- the interest drops down. But these are the same people who post numerous ads and requests for someone to 1x1 (or rp with them). But they won't give the same effort to someone.\n\nIf you are looking for EXACTLY something, then state so in your post. I am a writer, not a mind-reader. You want someone to play a specific fc? Do it. You want someone to play a certain plot with you? Don't be afraid to state so! \n\nTbh, now I am going to sound like a whiny baby, but all what I have ever wanted through my tumblr rp life - is to meet a like minded writer with whom I can have so much fun. We both create a bunch of stories and couples (and all kind of variations). We both send each other memes. We brainstorm ideas/headcanons for characters. Make inspos, pinterest, playlists, etc. And I see some people have it on tumblr and I keep wondering what is wrong with me, lol. Because I feel like an outsider looking into a bunch of friends having fun with each other and being able to maintain roleplays that last longer than a week. \n\nIf you ever want to vent to me about tumblr, feel free so :)",

I swear they're just there for the positivity (and that's all fine and good), but then they'll post a starter call or plotting call, and... NOT RESPOND TO **A N Y O N E**. I've noticed this more and more with blogs on Tumblr. It makes me hesitant to even try reaching out to anyone about RP'ing on that site anymore because I feel a similar sensation- they'll dangle a carrot in my face and then immediately yank it away, come back weeks later and say 'I'm sorry', post a new starter/plotting call... And repeat the process.\n\nI feel like some of the RP community on Tumblr is only there for the sake of pity-parties... And it sucks, because I know real life gets in the way, I know it can be stressful, I know taking time away from Tumblr is a good idea- but... This just feels like a cycle. A vicious, constant, annoying cycle. Starter call leads to disappearing for a week or so leads to apology leads to pity party leads to new starter call... Leads to disappearing-\n\nThe rate of ghosters/lack of response on Tumblr is painfully- PAINFULLY- staggering.\n\nAlthough I dunno, maybe I'm just butt-hurt because of the cycle.\n\nAnyway, similar agony, I feel your pain (I know a few muns who have done the 'get to plotting and then dash'), I hope that you're able to find better partners in the future... More **dedicated** partners, at least.",

            "body": "So, I have all my own individual thoughts on the Tumblr RPC, as I've actually had Real life get in the way, and it's caused me to ghost. I've also posted starter calls and not responded, guilty as charged. However, I think part of the reason that I blink in and out of Tumblr is just- Well, it's complex on my end.\n\nOf course, Real life gets in the way, OF COURSE. However, for me too, it's with how much Tumblr as a website CHANGES. The current format is so boring and demotivating to look at. I just revamped one of my Boku No Hero muses and then immediately dipped because the hell site sapped all my motivation. I wanna say it's a me problem, but then I can just immediately pour out a few posts a week on discord! It's so weird??? Maybe the UI is easier on the eyes, and the group environments are so encouraging...\n\nBut there's also this thing fandoms tend to do: **Content policing**. Some people straight up REFUSE to interact with you SIMPLY BECAUSE of a character in the fandom! Some people will even HARD BLOCK on sight if they see that muse on the dash. I get that some characters can be \"problematic\", but aren't you there less for the character and more for the portrayal? What if they are canon divergent? Also, people hard block blogs that roleplay out ships? Now I have to Trigger Warn my SHIPS??? Even if you associate with a certain fandom, people just won't interact with you. I ran a crossover blog for Jojo's and BNHA and struggled to get interaction, struggled to get threads, got good ones, and made lovely friends! But I only got a handful of interactions from the world my AU characters were based in. It wasn't like I made it hard for people to interact with me, either! It literally said in my rules that even if you hadn't seen one of the properties, it wasn't hard to get a grasp on the characters.\n\n*Then I made a BNHA only blog? All those people that had blocked or said no to threads with my crossover? Followed, instant mutuals, instant likes to my starter calls.*\n\nAlso, the cliques are a nightmare. Sometimes you really wanna interact with a certain person and pour so much into a thread, but they don't ghost you. They interact ONLY with people from THEIR thread groups. Most of their dash crack and commentary are based on inside jokes, and if you're not in that clique, you feel isolated and alienated, and not good enough. It sucks for your blog's self-confidence.\n\nSo yeah, Tumblr sucks. Discord's awesome.",

And then it repeats. And I really do think some people are only in it for the positivity, like you said. The rush and instant gratification of making a new blog, getting followers, getting likes on starter calls, getting people that say they want to write with them, getting compliments on their writing/portrayal despite doing barely any writing... then they dip out once it starts requiring effort.
