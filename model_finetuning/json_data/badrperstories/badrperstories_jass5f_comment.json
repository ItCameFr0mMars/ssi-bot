I was randomly blocked and my partner left a server without notifying me. 2 weeks before it had happened, they told me they were very busy and they will try to reply to me as soon as possible.  If they needed time, I would have never stopped them from taking care of themselves. Life does get in the way sometimes. Makes you wonder what truly happened. \n\nI guess they saved their own time without trying to make an excuse for themselves and just did what they have done. But it makes me very distrustful ever since then of when this is bound to happen again.\n\nJust a random thought: ~~I wonder if sometimes people ghost others it is because they're afraid to hurt other person's feelings? And because they don't want to feel bad? I am not trying to be an apologist for the ghosters community, but tbh, it just makes you wonder why do they do that.~~",
