            "body": "This sounds a lot like me back when I started my server a few years back, even down to the \"two days and now we love each other\" bit.   \n\n\nWhat I did was honestly pretty toxic and I don't recommend it. It's a miracle my story lasted through it. I got to a point where I realized half the server was bad. 25% percent had basically bullied me out of wanting to play in the server, and 25% had asked for so many allowances that the premise looked nothing like what I started with. I was being made to Mod a group I had no interest in. I came up with something I called \"The Culling.\" I posted an update and tagged everyone saying basically that I was going to be reworking the lore for clarity, but also that I was going to message people to tell them they were \"safe\" and anyone who didn't get that message had 2 weeks to course correct either by playing to the lore, raising their writing standards to meet our new minimum, or being less abrasive in OOC because I wouldn't tolerate bullying and contrary to popular belief - Admins have feelings too.   \n\n\nHonestly, I lost half my players and it took a year for me to build it back up. But as of right now, we're almost to our 3 year anniversary. I would not have continued to run my server if I'd let it continue the way it was going. I made a lot of enemies while I was figuring out how to run my own story, but I do think it was worth it in the end. Since then, I have not compromised my vision for anyone, no matter how close we are. I can't. I put hard work into my story. I know it's hard to play in. I know it's niche, but for the right players, it's a godsend and those are the people I made it for.   \n\n\nNow, if a duo comes in, I urge them to make characters in similar groups because making one in each purely to play out a forbidden love story is lore breaking and disrespectful. I tell them \"it's one thing if it happens organically, but if you know that you're going to pair your characters and you lore break like this, we will issue a strike.\" We don't approve applications that don't have the character fleshed out enough to weave them into our plot. Anyone who comes in with the \"oh it's a secret, you'll find out in play\" is plainly told that we can't approve a character like that because for all we know, they could be sneaking in a concept that is already taken or potentially game-breaking. There's a lot of restrictions we've added in over the last two years, not everyone enjoys it. I'm okay with that.   \n\n\nI've learned that, for me, it's better to have a small, good group that's passionate about what they're making and that knows they have clear lines of communication with the staff over a large server of 100+ players where the Admins and Mods can't tell half of them apart. Storylines are not a numbers game. Good RP servers are not popularity contests. If you believe in and are passionate about your concept, do not compromise it for anyone. If it takes kicking half your players because they refuse to play to the premise, then so be it. If you're in it, you can absolutely rebuild. It'll be hard, sure, but I promise it's worth it.",

            "body": "As one of the players of this server, yes we have all found this now, I would just like to say this. This isn't as black and white or even shades of grey as it was portrayed. Our GM never addressed anyone of us outside of game about any of this and none of us found each others characters boring. We were all invested and enjoying the RP till we found this post. Does our RP have some issues? Yes, I believe most do. But it seems the main thing that was an issue was that the GM had a particular story in mind and none of us were fitting into it properly. So instead of discussing it with us, we are only 6-8 players in total with 3-4 of us active at a time due to time-zones, they decided to go quiet for long periods of time until we had to figuratively beg for the next story post. Another thing that wasn't made clear is that this is the GM's 3rd time trying out this idea, so to be clear, they aren't 'new' to GMing this particular scenario.",
