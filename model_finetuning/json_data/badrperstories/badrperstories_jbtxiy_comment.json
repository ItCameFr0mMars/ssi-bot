Ironically, deflecting his stereotypical narc-ness on me got me banned twice in other places and times for \u201cbeing a remorseless sociopath\u201d myself.

Though Orange is easily the worst of the bunch, that I can say much.\n\n\nNow that you mention it, it does seem like he\u2019s quite a gatekeeper. He always brags about how he did T1-RM RP Combat on forums for real money, and thus that he\u2019s \u201cunbeatable\u201d when it comes to just RP\u2019ing with him on Amino whilst the RP Combat rules are rather loose aside from \u201cdon\u2019t auto\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t be a Sue\u201d or such. His attempt at educating others to \u201cRP like him\u201d have led to creating another bad RP\u2019er who couldn\u2019t keep to the Amino rules at all and just wanted to exercise his rape fetishes on OCs like those of mine.\n\n\nHeck, if your OCs\u2019 powers or natural abilities aren\u2019t somehow scientifically accurate, Orange\u2019ll take them away from your character in combat. Got a soul-damaging attack or life-stealing magic trick? Instead of imagining what that would mean like a slowly weakening and withering attack, he\u2019ll say it doesn\u2019t work because of course souls don\u2019t exist (unless your religion says so but he wouldn\u2019t care either way). Got an angel with wings but they aren\u2019t the size of a small plane and come with additional tail feathers? Congratulations, you now got a Kid Icarus but with no real cool handicap, even if you just wanted to fly in the first place.\n\n\nAnd then just your regular OC design insults. He despises tropes and cliches beyond any normal reason, so stereotyping your OCs will earn you a lecture on how his are so much better.\n\n\nGot a little brat OC going through a phase but having potential to grow up a softer person? He\u2019s got a big bulky bodybuilder mob boss who can turn into gold, loves gold, trains to never lose a fight with sheer muscles and gold, and screw all his friend\u2019s OCs.\n\n\nGot an orb that\u2019s also an alien from some diamond planet that pilots kid-sized mech suits that spit fire and are like trigger happy Marsians? He\u2019s got a big bulky bodybuilding gang boss fighter guy who\u2019s somehow also a teacher at the local academy, trains to never lose a fight with sheer muscles, and screws all his friend\u2019s OCs.\n\n\nMost of his OCs are shelved goods anyway, yet he chews out some of my friends from making \u201cmindless gimmick OCs once and never using them again\u201d. Who cares?\n\n\nOnly his personal friend club get to go on arcs he made, and you gotta be invited. I wouldn\u2019t even bother since he never even finished one before people ran from boredom.",

            "body": "Yeah pretty much so. I do appreciate a good reference for a character\u2019s recognizable features, and I even draw my own because it can be so insightful! Taken from an anime, live-action film or not, I\u2019m often even more amazed if someone can turn an already-existing character into an entirely new one by using them as a face claim, and they\u2019re not manditory in my eyes but might add a tiny tad more to their existence. And let me tell you, I\u2019ve seen a lot of good ones! [\\^\\^]\n\n\nI know from Orange that he likes to draw his own OCs as well. But, not really like how I prefer abit of extra freedom and training my wrist... Orange just constantly says that not designing an entirety new character from your wrist on paper will guarantee that your character\u2019ll be bad and unoriginal.\n\n\nI would hypothesize that he maybe hates the anime artstyle or people making Japanese OCs, but he\u2019s a rather big shonen weeb (and somewhat questionable hentai admirer) himself.\n\n\nHe does however despise tropes and cliches as if they\u2019re the worst things a writer could resort to and shames anybody for not sharing his \u201ctalent\u201d when it comes to making characters and writing arcs. Which is really sad, because that might demotivate a young creative spirit from using them in their works because they\u2019re not bad but they might now think that they are.\n\n\nAll of Orange\u2019s OCs have either been a combination of: being extreme bodybuilders, have ties to the mob, are or were in some sort of gang, have a competitive fighting or military background, inhumane upbringing, scarred by it in some way or form, obsessed with honor, perfection, winning every fight, discipline, becoming even stronger, are mysterious when it comes to big events that scarred them into becoming the antiheroes/villains that they are now today, etc.\n\n\nHe plays on a lotta tropes and cliches himself. Worse is, that most of his characters are the same minus the blonde hair or maybe the strength stat.\n\n\nMeanwhile he calls other Users with way more design-diverse and creative OCs\u2014faceclaim or not\u2014worse than that he is. I myself deal in Sci-Fi and aliens, with light ties to the *Doctor Who* canon since I RP to practice my screenplay writing for it. Tsundere tiny brats with a heart of gold, super tall intellectual that\u2019s happy yet serious to play games yet can\u2019t stomach losing or looking dumb, a literal hothead from the \u201cnear\u201d future lacking much info about his past whilst his destiny is still up in the air, a blue crystal orb that\u2019s on fire 90% of the time and is an adorable Marsian stereotype who loves steamrolling some planets with their species, a literal Flatlander (2D organism) out to explore beyond his known world and fight any \u201cgods\u201d of the 3rd dimension, one of the first children born on the Moon ready to go further whilst also seeking to aid her known world with healing from disasters, a not-so-human girl partially \u201cupgraded\u201d by cybernetic organisms who\u2019s condition can\u2019t be reversed and is searching for her missing father, and the list literally goes on for like a good 20+ more OCs.\n\n\nReally, Orange doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I wish the Amino would grow some good self-respect and get him kicked out but sadly he has his manipulative ways to have his cake and eat it as well.\n\n\nFor a 22yo, I guess he just hasn\u2019t really grown up yet.",
