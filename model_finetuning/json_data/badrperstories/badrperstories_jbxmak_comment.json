I\u2019m getting the feeling that this is one big mess of no one communicating properly. \n\nNo offence but you also sound pretty harsh. Saying \u201cno excuses\u201d and saying you still managed to roleplay whilst still in school isn\u2019t really helpful. You don\u2019t know if the dude took this up thinking he could do it and then was suddenly swamped by homework (I\u2019m curious as to what the ages you allow in your server are as you sorta can\u2019t expect high schoolers and college students to have the most reliable schedules as they can literally change at a moments notice. One day you may be told you\u2019ve got all the time in the world to rp then the next you\u2019re swamped with fifty assignments.) or if he decided to join to waste other people\u2019s time for his entertainment.\n\nI just felt like you could\u2019ve handled this better is all. \n\nIn all honesty though he seems to be rping ooc more than ic. I understand your frustration man but you sorta need to keep your cool a bit more. You come across as easily annoyed and a bit..I dunno, not very understanding.\n\nPerhaps you should update your rules and put a time zone plus availability requirement to avoid shit shows like this in the future.",

The thing with missions is that it is very much stated beforehand that we prefer that people are available. \n\nMy issue is that he went silent without any indicator of anything. I wanted to replace him because we need communication. He said I already knew his time-zone (which I didn\u2019t, because he rarely speaks.) One-lining, especially with the way he does it, takes forty seconds. There\u2019s no excuse for no clear communication on his side. We established we wanted things fluid. \n\nI tried to ask him to switch out with another person who was more available and he said no. Either way, had he been swamped by homework, I would have accepted that if he took the out. He is the one who is choosing to continue despite maybe not being available (he\u2019s still not being specific). \n\nI kept my cool for quite a bit before becoming strict. Fandom-based Roleplay tends to need a stricter hand, especially with these situations. Custom roleplays are much easier, with fandom ones being more toxic/wild.",
