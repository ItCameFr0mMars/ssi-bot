I just find it creepy when people use real life faceclaims, but I hate anime/drawings as well, especially when people take someone's original drawing and make it their character's image. I don't mind, \"this is how I'd imagine my character\" I'm guilty of that myself, but from that and to straight up say, \"this is my character\", yikes. \n\nSome of the most toxic episodes I've seen in rp has been over faceclaims. There was a huge episode on jcink when people started using kpop stars as their faceclaims and it honestly just proved that a lot of rp'ers are racists, but a lot of people also had prejudices toward others based on their faceclaims. If you used a kpop star as your faceclaim , you were automatically a bad rp'er. It's not just kpop stars, it happens to people who use other unpopular faceclaims. Got an actor that people like? You'll get flooded with rp. Got a less liked or known actor? Sit in your own shit.\n\nI've started just excluding faceclaims from my rps. I'd much rather people prove to me that they know how to go into details about their characters look, without doing a \"my immortal\" but also without just pulling an image out of their ass and going \"this is my character\"\n\nI'm sorry but it is extremely creepy to use real life people for your characters. Yes, actors are commercially available to everyone, but it's still creepy as fuck. I have seen a lot of people excuse their faceclaim uses by explaining that it's like hiring an actor for a role in a movie and again, I'm sorry but it's not. The actor did not consent to your role and knowing the rp world, especially on jcink, you're most likely going to write intimate scenes while fingerring yourself to the mental image of that actor in that scene. Just stop it. It's creepy.",

            "body": "Something I find hilarious is when the FC doesn\u2019t fit the character in the slightest. Usually, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t resist the temptation of using a conventionally hot actor/model.\n\nFor example, someone contacted me on Amino and begged me to write romance with them. Their OC was supposed to be a shy, clumsy, reserved girl who was bullied for being unattractive/plain and didn\u2019t know how to stand out or \u201cact sexy\u2019.\n\nThe reference pictures? Many shoots of an attractive model with a perfect body posing in underwear and revealing clothing giving the camera seductive. Even if there was nothing too explicit, some of this photos were meant to look sexy; I\u2019m they were allowed considering how strict Amino\u2019s guidelines can be. \n\nLike, all of this clearly screams \u201cshy, inexperienced, plain girl who doesn\u2019t know how to show off\u201d, right?",

I lost track of how many people use popular actors as their face claim or some \"overly hot\" Instagram model. A lot of people just choose model-worthy face claims and they don't look natural in the slightest with no imperfections.

Whether it's my characters being afflicted or THEIRS, I look at this faceclaim and I want to shrivel up. 'That actor/model would find this cringy as hell'- and by extension, 'The CHARACTER would find it cringy as hell'. Any time I've been asked to do it, I try for a moment and then just give up. No actors fit any of my characters- they're firmly in my head.\n\nMaybe it's knee-jerk empathy or something. If people want to do the stuff in their private circles and partnerships, I couldn't care less. I really don't like using them or being around those that use them, however. I think it's because they can't visualise characters or written-word very well and in that case, that's indicative of roleplay ability.",

            "body": "I use faceclaims because they're fun and a picture is worth a thousand words. I could spend all the time in the world describing what my character looks like, but at the end of the day, whoever is roleplaying with me will always imagine a character differently than they look in my head. And some might say that this shouldn't be an issue, that that just comes with the territory of writing, but to me roleplaying isn't the same as writing a novel. If I am writing creatively *with someone else*, I want us to be on the same page in terms of how something or someone looks. That's just me. I love using faceclaims as a *blueprint* of what my character looks like, but not as a 100% representation. No faceclaim will ever match exactly what I see in my head, but it's the closest thing that can convey to my partner what I am picturing. For me personally, it makes stories feel more real. If someone doesn't wish to use them, that's fine. If someone wishes to have a conversation about how sometimes using faceclaims, especially of people who have specifically stated that they don't wish to be used as one, can be taken too far or can be done inappropriately, that's fine too. But what's not fine is being elitist and condescending towards people who do choose to use them.\n\nEdit: to the part about it being mandatory, I don't agree that it should be mandatory or that someone should tell you *who* to use if you do use faceclaims. That's happened to me before and it pisses me off, I want to use my own shit, not be told who to play just to serve the agenda of some thirsty weirdo. If someone is making it mandatory, then by all means you have the right to reject a partner/roleplay.",

I tried telling her that I\u2019d prefer finding my own photo for a faceclaim if she required her partner to have one, as I already had an idea for a character I was more interested in playing who looked nothing like brooding vampire guy in my mind. It goes without saying the RP never went anywhere after I politely said I\u2019d prefer to make my own character to play as. She begrudgingly agreed to not force a faceclaim on me... then she sulked. She proceeded to leave a few feeble, curt responses to any ideas I tried throwing her way plot wise, and never heard from her again. Probably for the best tbh, as that was a bit weird imo.\n\nWhile on the topic of faceclaims, I just have to also mention how much I hate it when people ghost you because they don\u2019t fancy the person in the photo you picked. I get even more mad if we agreed about romance not being forced in the RP before hand, or that it was going to be a platonic style RP so crushing on someone wouldn\u2019t matter anyway... ugh people confuse me.",
