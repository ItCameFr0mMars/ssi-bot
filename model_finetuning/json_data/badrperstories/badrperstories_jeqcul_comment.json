They also have the A tag for people who are non binary to enter their own identity in their post or their title, they just didn't want to add more flairs as for each flair identity, there are four actual flairs that people can add to their post, and they have a lot of flairs already. This doesn't seem to be an issue of representation, as a lot of trans and NB people use r/roleplaypartnersearch perfectly fine and have no issue with the flairs at all, and will use the A flag and be more specific in their post, or if theyre binary trans, they use the binary flairs. Tbh I don't really see what the problem is or what about this is transphobic. That's a serious accusation you're making with not a lot of proof that they actually dislike or discriminate against trans people.

Your proposed solution is that *your* identity is worth specifically representing, but someone else's minority identity is not. By this logic, limiting tags to M, F, and A is fine, as it represents the vast majority - right?\n\nBy identifying as specifically 'trans' rather than the gender you are transitioning to, are you not maintaining your status as an 'other' rather than embracing the espoused concept that sex and gender are not linked?",

            "body": "This a bit of a loaded historical question. In the past, it was the goal of binary trans people to be as close to a cisgender individual as possible. You wanted to blend in to avoid detection, for everything from being mocked to legitime harm may be coming to you. This is called \"passing\" it is a constant anxiety for trans people, it fits into the idea of being enough like the gender you identify as, and even affects Nonbinary presenting people. The problem with current tagging systems is how they don't cooperate with trans gender identities, they just get to coexist in their world. The idea of changing them is moving the pressures of being trans more in the open. Respsentiaon isn't just being accounted for it is uplifting groups that need the help. \n\nBeing othered by the majority group that has a history of mistreating you and having your identity displayed by what you put forward are two different things. Being a trans person is a different experience than being cis. The term \"Othering\" refers to the practice of dehumanizing and erasing the presence of a minority group, not just the obvious definition of one thing being different from the other. I am a woman, but I am also a trans woman. One term describes me in more detail and helps communicate who I am and what I have been through. \n\nThe discussion of when minority groups are \"worth representing\" is a slippery slope, you can't let the ease of use always outweigh the realities of being human.",

This sounds more like social-political mumbo jumbo that you either believe wholecloth or reject rather than a reasoned argument.\n\nHow are the tags harmful? How does real-world mistreatment relate to online tags when the chance of being 'beaten up' or other examples for your identity related to your online post are closer to 0% than 1% by a vast margin? \n\nYeah, the term othering refers to that.

Why does your 'more specific' identity make any difference to online communication, especially when you are playing a character other than yourself?",

By posting this, (which btw, isn't a bad rper story as I said, this is just you airing your dislike which is against what the sub is about), you're directing harassment towards the mods. Also, I don't see them talking down to you. they're trying to explain to you that it's a PRACTICAL issue, and you don't seem to be listening to them at all. Also, this doesn't seem like the first time you brought this up demanding a change which isn't a practical one. They have a flair made specifically for NB and trans folk who aren't comfortable in the Binary, which allows them to clarify their identity in their post or in the title. They publically behaved very well, in my opinion. Also, this post could be considered libel and could get you taken to court. Transphobia -in the sense of being condescending is a serious accusation, and can in some countries can lead to people being sent to jail. You're making really serious accusations on a public forum and directing harassment at these mods purely on the basis that you felt patronised? Maybe you were patronised because you refused to listen to the advice given by them or the explanations given, and instead fell back on the victim card. The fact you feel like you're the hero here is absolutely blowing me away.",

            "body": "I am not going to get into it much than what I have already talked about. Because aruging with cis people about trans issues isn't my favorite thing in the world. It is not harassment, I didnt direct anyone to do anything but talk to mods on subs they use to engage with better flairs. Thats a call to action, I am not super concerned with the posted sub beyond warning trans people that it isn't the best place to be in. I am a trans woman, they where being transphobic, I know this because I am living it. Unless you would like to weigh in on your own experience as a trans person I dont think you get to tell me when someone is or isn't doing something harmful. Being a bigot isn't black and white, it is a scale. The small things do still matter and are hurtful. I dont need you to lecture me on the consequences of calling someone a transphobe. If you think think a label of biggatory is more harmful than genuinely shitty behavior you have no idea what you are talking about. \n\nI have delt with more than one group, some just said \"we don't want to do it\" straight up. That's all it kinda takes all I can do is try to be an advocate. This group is the only one that chose to try and explain that they were just fine with the trans representation they had and that it was impossible to do while I know it actully isn't at all. I will reiterate I have mod experience on a large sub with plenty more flairs than what they having going on. It isn't impossible it's really easy to do. I am just being consistently ignored and told my concerns don't exist and have solutions. I am done with this.",
