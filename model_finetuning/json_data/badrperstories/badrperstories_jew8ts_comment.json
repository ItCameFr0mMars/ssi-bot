I apologise, So I will try to dialogue with you and explain myself better.\n\nYou see, one cannot tell me the author did a good thing by attempting to start a reverse crusade over some tags.

Any of these behaviours are not part of the subreddit the author attacked, so it is a very grave lie to say \"oh X is transphobic\". Expecially on the net.\n\nWhat I meant from the steamrolling part, is that is not transphobic to disagree with someone belonging to this minority. \nDisagreeing and having a proper opinion is a right that belongs to everyone, and one can't cover it up with a \"No I am trans hence I must be always right and if you don't agree with me you are a transphobe\" like the author did, otherwise the world would be straight up madness. \nI hope it is more clear now.",

No. That\u2019s not accurate. \n\nI\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt because the way that you write makes me think that English isn\u2019t your first language and you\u2019re still getting the hang of it, but transphobia comes in many forms. The things that you described are all transphobia, yes, but so is generalized discomfort with trans* people and trans issues. You don\u2019t need to be openly hostile toward trans people to be transphobic; merely being uncomfortable with them is enough. That is why the word ends in -phobia. \n\nI wasn\u2019t there and I missed the thread, but if the OP of it said something along the lines of \u2018the mods of x sub refuse to do this simple thing that would accommodate their trans user base without good reason, hence they are being transphobic\u2019, then that\u2019s a valid claim. And FWIW, if that\u2019s the way it went down, I\u2019m inclined to agree with them because adding an extra filter or two is the easiest damn thing in the world to do, and acting like it\u2019ll add ~clutter~ is a piss-poor excuse. The problem with a lot of subreddits is that they aren\u2019t organized enough. More filters is not a bad thing. \n\nThis in the same principle that, IDK, if there was a dating site or something that was coded to ONLY let people look for a heterosexual romantic partner, and then someone was like \u2018hey it would be cool if gay and lesbian people could find partners here\u2019 and the site said \u2018no because then we\u2019d need to add a few more lines of code to the drop down window and profile pages and we don\u2019t want to do that\u2019, it would be accurate to maybe think that the people running the dating site might be homophobic.",

Nevertheless I read again through the rules and posts of the targeted subreddit with your definition in my head, and found there is no discomfort or fear towards trans. \n\nI do not think that is the case you are talking about, as the reason was merely practical and not of a phobic-related issues, as I disagree when you say \"More filters is not a bad thing\".\nMore filters are a bad thing when it comes to use the filters as the mods stated the majority of people are misusing the filters, despite there is a pretty clear explanation about all of them.\nTo make a simple example if I were to search in a image website a tag of like \"red hair\" I wouldn't be surprised to find out there are different tags such as \"redhead\" \"rouge hair\" or so on, which complicates my research as I will have to check all of them in order to have a full screen of the situation. That would be the issue if more and more tag are implemented and misused, mostly because someone place their own gender as tag, while others use it for the character gender. and I can sympathize the fact the mods are not able to deal with everything as they are humans, they have private lives too so they'd prefer simpler and less tags such as M F and A (Any). \nWriting a title that specifies whatever you are/what you are looking for instead seems like a more specific way to find what you need, as one can search a subreddit also by title. \n\nI also re-state that name, or worse, link the place of the bad breaks the rules of BadRoleplayStories, without mentioning this story could have caused a witch hunt to a sub that at least to me, it's innocent from it's so called guilts, as it is a practical and management issue and not some kind of angst over a minority.
