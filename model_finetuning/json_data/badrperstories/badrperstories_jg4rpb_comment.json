It denies the other party the right to interfacing with their immediate local universe through a causality manifold, which is to say, learning the *true* relationships of their input / output framework of action / reaction when interfacing with the local universe, and therefor denies them the opportunity to twist the appropriate knobs that might maximize their well being by allowing them to navigate in a direction closer to their optimal experience. It's selfish because by giving them \"junk data\" (\"it's not you, it's me\"), you're able to eject from a flawed framework under pseudo exculpatory pretense, leaving them on board the sinking framework with the false belief that all systems are normal and it isn't sinking. It isn't *easy or fun* to tell the truth, but you have a moral obligation to do so. It's *right* to do so.",

There's obviously a potential opportunity cost in honesty, but it's such a minor cost in the long run. They can respond negatively in the short term, and that's \"unpleasant\", and we seem to be very concerned at mitigating and avoiding any \"unpleasantness\". That motivated reasoning to describe things in a way different than they truly are (obscurantism) is inherently self-serving. It benefits the first party at the expense of the second party. *At the expense of.* The second party never consented to pay that cost, especially not for something they haven't even done yet, for something that's purely theoretical and they may not even do.",
