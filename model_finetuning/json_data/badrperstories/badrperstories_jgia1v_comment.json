            "body": "I had one story about this person who kept on looking for attention, this character was supposed to be a sort of kunoichi, but after something like two second this girl turned out to be one of the most attention seeking character I ever seen, I mean you'd expect a minimum of cool head-ness from a girl who's literal job is to kill people and infiltrate into places but instead this person crushed down sobbing on a street because someone was not giving her much attention. Out of pity this other person's character decided to pick her up and give her some comfort, but she kept on sobbing around for absolute no reason. I don't remember how exactly the story ended up, the best hypothesis my mind came up with is that the player made the char suicide herself despite to the fact she was engaged in a relationship with the person she loved.\n\nIn real life I think that have someone behaving like that character is one of the most exhausting things ever, you are basically doomed to carry around their emotional baggage plus sedate your own from ever expressing something. Either it is a romance or a simple friendship, it's kinda toxic and I am kinda sure anyone would try to slide their way away from that person as soon as possible. \n\nSo if you aim to make your character as realistic as possible, your character will probably come up with the idea of avoiding that character, which is a completely normal human feeling as friendship or social relationship with that person shouldn't be a chore unless your character is W's personal psychologist.  \nI am not a psychologist myself but I believe that no matter how traumatic the event could be, a person struggles to return acting normal after what happened, regardless of the trauma. Surely there will be situations where people refuse to do something related to that event, but I sincerely believe that they will try to forget or at least slightly move on with the best they got. In this case I refer myself to Springhole dot net once again, I link you a very interesting article W's player may be interested into making W more realistic.  \n[https://springhole.net/writing/better-tragic-and-traumatic-backstories.htm](https://springhole.net/writing/better-tragic-and-traumatic-backstories.htm)  \nTalk about this problem ooc with your partner send them this link, demand your part of the spotlight and the right to make the story progress and if you can't come up with a mutual agreement, I suggest you to leave that roleplayer.   \nThat's all I got for you, I wish you good luck",

            "body": "I honestly hateeee when people do this- like- okay, so, of course- you are going to have different kinds of characters you rp with, some characters can be purposely written to be an attention seeker- right? Like I have a character who is an attention seeker, I have rped with characters who were purposely written to be attention seekers- all that. That's not necessarily a bad thing at all! It can definitely be a character flaw you can write into your characters- or anything like that.  \n\n\nHowever- there's a difference, I'd say, between people who are writing attention seeking characters and people who are just straight up attention seekers in general. I've noticed that people who have characters that attention seek are usually like, aware of that, and they kind of write their characters in a way so you *know* they are someone who wants attention. Like either saying it straight up or implying it, you get the sort of idea.   \n\n\nBut then you get to the other kind. People who want you to constantly feel bad for their characters, cry over them, have the edgiest backstories, literally- poorly written characters who just do things for attention. Like you've said, the \"I'm having those thoughts again... yeh suicidal ones\"- like wha-? And that kind of stuff goes on constantly? That of course would make the rp boring. Sure, you can have a character have trauma or struggles, but you shouldn't constantly make the other person's character feel \"bad\" for them, ya know? Like it's just so one sided and unfun to have to constantly console a character because the roleplayer wants to attention seek. It's so annoying.  \n\n\nI once have rped with this girl who like, always did stuff like that. I wanted to try a new kind of rp out and she was willing to do it so we figured out our plot and got started. I specifically said I didn't want the rp to go romantic between our 2 protagonist characters, she said sure that's fine, we had other plans- but then during the rp she did in fact try to pursue my character romantically even after we agreed we weren't going to be doing that. Of course, my character always said \"oh thanks but no thanks\", and tried to move on from her advances, but that made her mad I guess- so every second her character was crying \"oh why don't you love me why am I not pretty enough?\" etc, etc, everything like that. Her character would threaten to kill herself, her character would get jealous and threaten to kill other characters, her character would always get into some kind of trouble and expect my character to be a night in shining armor and save her character. This was. every. single. scene. in the rp. and It always got boring, got repetitive, I didn't wanna rp with her after a while.  \n\n\nThis kinda thing is soooo annoying, and I really hope you find a roleplayer that you can rp with and actually enjoy the rp, where they don't do this attention seeking bull shit, and the rp is actually fun and rewarding to you both in the end. I wish you the best of luck in finding great people!",
