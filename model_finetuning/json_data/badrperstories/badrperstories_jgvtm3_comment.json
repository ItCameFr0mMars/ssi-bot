Adapting is not copying.\n\nThat being said, if your partner is taking offense at what they perceive as \"copying\", then the diplomatic thing to do is go back to writing your usual way without the adaptations.

For me it's always been a 'When In Rome' concept; it brings a certain balance and cohesion that in my opinion only improves the story as it's written and allows posts to fluctuate better between each other. Naturally we try to adapt, I don't personally see an issue with it.\n\nThat said and perhaps I'm being antagonistic, but it seems more they might be self-conscious of it. A lot of writers suffer anxiety and are self-critical; exhibiting a form of uniqueness helps with that in a way that they may use to excuse their own criticism with their own writing in exchange for it feeling 'truly unique' or something like that. In the end I feel the cultivation of writing talent is a combination of influences from other writers and media much like drawn or painted art. I'm probably wrong on my guess, it just feels like such a weird thing for them to mention. Personally I'd be flattered in such a case.\n\nYou're not wrong as the Queen decrees. Alas for placation I'd also recommend to revert back a bit to your own tried and true style. In the future though do not let this one experience discourage you from admiring and trying another's prose, especially in combining it to something anew.",

Imitation is indeed the best form of flattery, but in the same vein, when you roleplay with someone you expect to write with a person whose style differs from your own; otherwise it sort of reads like you\u2019ve just written the entire thing.\n\nAs an example from a roleplay I did, I once wrote a very distinct description of something during a sexual scene. The next post, that person also used the *exact same* description out of the blue, when their erotic writing had been very different from that up until that point. It *really* threw me out of the scene for a moment.",

In my opinion, it is my way of being courteous and showing respect towards the other writer. At the end of the day, I'm just happy to be roleplaying with someone promising, so I do whatever I can to make sure they are as comfortable and happy as I am.\n\nHowever, I can also understand the other side of the argument, that being that you are unable to find your own voice. A very big part of a writers success is their style, so if you spend more time copying others, you'll have less time to know your own style. Now I'm not saying that any of us are legitimate authors publishing novels, but we are still writers at the end of the day. \n\nIf I could equate it to anything, their offense that is, I would compare it to speech patterns and tones. Everyone has a certain way of speaking, so if you talk or try to talk exactly like the other, they might see it as a form of mockery. My point isn't to say that you should stop trying to conform to other writing styles, I advocate it, but I just wanted to present my thoughts on why your partner might have said that so you can better understand them.",

            "body": "This is a weird thing for your partner to pick at, in my opinion. The way someone's writing voice sounds depends on genre, tone, context, all kinds of junk. And in RP, where two or more people are writing together, your writing is going to change depending on who you're working with. And yeah, that means you're usually going to sound a little similar; I'm not gonna be writing *Macbeth* while my partner is going for *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*\u2014that's just gonna be weird for everyone involved!\n\nWhat's more, I don't think developing your voice works the way they seem to think. Besides the aforementioned natural adaption, a writing voice is determined by a conglomerate of what you know, what you don't know, and what you like. It's a lot like how visual art styles develop. You ultimately can't \"pick\" a personal writing voice; it just happens while doing the things you usually do in order to get better. You can imitate to the best of your ability, sure---but your voice is always going to be there in some magnitude, especially in a creative hobby with no oversight involved.\n\nWhat I'm saying is what you're doing is pretty natural, and a *lot* of us do it! Your writing \"voice\" isn't going to \"stop developing\" because you're adapting to your environment for consistency; to me, that just sounds like good roleplaying. I wouldn't worry about it.",

That said, there are times where I can see getting frustrated with someone for blatant copying, but that would be in a very specific scenario.   \n\n\nYears ago, I used to use \"\\[fin\\]\" to show that my response was finished (since they'd take numerous comment boxes to get out), and this writing partner started using it instead of his previous \"-done\" signifier. I got really mad about it, because I associated it to be a trademark of my writing and he'd only started doing it when we wrote together. He refused to stop, so I stopped writing with him.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, that was pretty petty on my end. But that's not really about the actual writing. I don't think I've ever heard of this not being accepted.",
