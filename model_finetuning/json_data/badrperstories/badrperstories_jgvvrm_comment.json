I always end up with ridiculous people who won't contribute anything to the plot, if I'm running of ideas and I ask, they will just go \"idk\" and IT'S SO ANNOYING. Is either that or impossibilities.

            "body": "Answer 1a is probably the closest to reality. While I've had experience with the one shot interview ( all parties departing if the suggested plot doesn't work ) generally it's more that people have zero idea what they want. A lot of people do indeed want creative ideas and solutions handed to them. The issue extends to adding on to such a thing such as suggestions and negotiation.\n\nI've been in the position of pitching a passionate and inspired idea or adding onto their own and receiving, more often then not, a 'I love it' without any thoughtful input. It's especially noticeable when you ask questions during an exposition. Getting a single answer that doesn't even address the three other inquiries you pitched is a clear show they aren't paying attention or you set off their 'oh god yes I don't have to do any work' alarm.\n\nI'm personally jaded from experience ( so this is just a poor assumption really ) but I'd say they just lack the passion and enthusiasm you may have. \n\nThat and some are inept at human interaction pre-RP, so I suppose keep that in mind. I'll go ahead and spoil it for you too: trudging through the process does not pay off. \n\nThis is just a classic red flag you gotta watch out for with people.",
