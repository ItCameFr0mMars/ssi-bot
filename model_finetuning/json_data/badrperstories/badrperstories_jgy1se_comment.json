I don't care how 'strong' someone is, getting smacked in the dome with a solid object is going to force a reaction of some kind. This particular stranger sounds as if he was really, really intent to playing out the power fantasy of a 'Badass Apocalyptic Dude'. That and he was a bit too conceited to allow more realistic survivors get the drop on him; his poor ego was at stake. \n\nThey might of been the type who very much enjoys ( probably too much ) playing the 'big stronk independent' type. For them the RP might be more about the high octane and the 'living the fantasy' factor while you and your friend seemed far more intent on enjoying a cooperative story of struggle and survival.\n\nA difference of writing intent; I'd simply proceed to be wary if you hear the gas-guzzling in a future scene.",

            "body": "Lol. It was, in fact, a trainwreck. What happened is that one day, we were roleplaying the aftermath of our encounter with Rambo, which was poorly treated. We had to convince him to leave us alone, he wouldn't budge and eventually threw a tantrum and left on his own after no one wanted to kick him out, nor rp with him. Anyway, the admins also refused our pleads to pretend that that hadn't happened because it \"was important for the plot\", even tho we were in clear disadvantage.\n\nToretto's knock-off left us without a car, without a gun, without food and water, and only kept the kitchen knife. We were supposed to get to Pennsylvania and we were in fucking Missouri. Whatever, we thought, we'll have to think in something else. Turns out another person had joined shortly after that, and we got to tell them they could stick with us. Our characters were introducing themselves when the admins basically shut it down completely.\n\nThey said something along the lines of \"you all wake up at the same time in different dark rooms with no windows\" and some other bs. Basically, they told us that the plot had changed: now we were all trapped in an abandoned mental hospital, haunted by demons and ghosts. Also, we had to modify our characters so they'd have powers????\n\nThey said that 1. If we didn't comply with it, we would be kicked out of the group. THAT was the plot now and there was no changing. and 2. We weren't allowed to play with any people we had roleplayed with so far (meaning I couldn't play with V or the new person), no exceptions, and again; if we didn't comply, we would be kicked out.\n\nI messaged V and told them that I didn't like it anymore. I don't like being threatened nor the new plot. I had signed up for zombie badass blood and guts; not to get a ghost to play peekaboo with me. I told them that they could stay, but I was out, but they agreed with me. We voiced our concerns to the whole group (particularly, I did it... with a little salt added to it) and we were both out.\n\nFive minutes later, the new person messaged us, laughing their ass off, and sent us some screenshots: turns out everyone that wasn't an admin in that group agreed with me and in less than 30 seconds they were all out. The admin freaked out and posted in her WhatsApp status that everyone was immature and rude, and that that was the last time she would roleplay in her life. She deleted all groups. Still don't know what she was expecting.",
