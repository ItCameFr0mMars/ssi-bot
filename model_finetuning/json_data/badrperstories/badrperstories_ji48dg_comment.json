The stigma is so great that it's an instant no from mods or potential rp partners. Yes I made a character that could crush a moon and destroy civilizations but he just wants to have fun in his fights or eat (think goku) or yeah, my vampire drinks blood and is hard to kill but he was turned good by a spell that flips alignment and is more likely to offer you a nice earl grey then to rip your throat out.",
