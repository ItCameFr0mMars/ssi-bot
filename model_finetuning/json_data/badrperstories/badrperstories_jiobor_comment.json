He's already shown you how much work he's going to put in.\n\nAs for making sure my partners don't leave me with everything, it depends.  If they're very clearly not trying, I end it before it goes too far.   I think there's usually a gut feeling that it's not going to work, but it gets ignored because we want it to work out so badly.  It's hard when there's something we really want to do, but it's important to recognize the situation for what it is rather than what we want it to be.\n\nOn the other hand, if we've been rping for awhile and they're otherwise a great partner who puts in effort in other areas, I talk to them about it.  Sometimes people don't realize what's happening.  Sometimes they're actually planning/building up to something and you've missed the signs.  Sometimes they are afraid to take the lead because they don't want to step on your toes.  Sometimes they really are just passive and have no ideas.  In that case, it's a matter of deciding if the good points make up for the bad.",

            "body": "I think I will. I've approached one last week who gave me a paragraph after I gave him 8 and I asked if he could meet the minimum of 3 paragraphs as I asked in my ad, he said he'd try which was awesome but never sent me a revised reply so on one hand, I'm glad I spoke of to that guy and gave him a chance to know my expectations weren't met. But anyway, the guy in this post, I think I will express that it's not looking feasible for us to write together. I don't want anyone to feel like they can't walk away once they express interest. Sometimes I feel like some folks are apathetic to the point of doing it on purpose haha. \n\nI do think my gut is telling me this guy isn't going to work out. I think the discussion leading up to the posts themselves reflect someone's writing and intent pretty well. It's just a shame because earlier today he was pretty engaged and more detailed but it's like he's suddenly flipped a switch. Siigh.\n\nIt is good to have that foresight, even when you're wanting something so badly, you'd compromise a lot to get it. It's tough to not get too invested early on. You're right. And to trust your gut and assess. I think after writing with someone, you can figure out how to best discuss plot with them or know them enough to let things progress without as much planning, to trust they can lead/follow as needed.\n\nI may bring up in my next message, as you said, they may not want to step on my toes (though I thought I made it clear I'm happy to go other ways). We can only assume so much without making sure how someone is feeling and for all I know, he may have just changed his mind or maybe isn't in front of a keyboard where he can best articulate his ideas. I don't mind leading him but he's kind of gone dead-fish at the moment and I'll see if he might be feeling more talkative tomorrow or something. \n\nThanks for some of your thoughts!",

Discuss your interest, ask them what they like and what they want in the story itself. Always take time to know the person at the surface level, take the time to prep before just diving into the roleplay itself. I find that this works out 75% of the time and if through the planning stage, you find that they aren't pulling their weight to contribute, **it is okay to change your mind and not write with them.**",
