            "body": "Oh boy, let's see...\n\nGuy randomly activated a rinnegan in the middle of a fight, definitely wasn't on his character sheet or approved. That happened a few times. Also other random abilities that people would pull out of nowhere ranging from surprise implanted sharingan to magical mind reading abilities. \n\nAbout a million character apps trying to build convoluted lineages to \"win\" extra abilities for having a \"creative\" backstory that justified getting to break the rules. Spoiler, it didn't ever work. There were so many versions of: my character is the product of seven generations of a secret breeding program to combine all the best of Senju, Uchiha, Hyuga, Uzumaki, and five other kekkei genkai into one ninja and I was also educated and modified by Orochimaru. \n\nIn one group people kept wanting to infiltrate one of the villages and steal information, kill people, etc. When the kage and other leaders set up official security measures that meant people had to do more than just walk up and take something from the library or a random desk, people were **UPSET**.\n\nIn that same group, the entirety of the ANBU force was corrupt and/or incompetent. The leader of the force failed three times to investigate something and it was always for some dumb reason. The first time was along the lines of, \"I found a tunnel leading to a door and it wasn't on our maps.\" \"Did you go inside and see what was there?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because you just said to look for anything out of place.\" He was reassigned to follow up on this but failed two more times for similarly asinine reasons and was then demoted. He threw a complete fit about this OOC. Later it turned out he was also involved in an Akatsuki-like group at the same time he was the ANBU leader. Another ANBU was best friends with someone in another village. He stood by and watched while that foreigner attacked someone from his village. He got in trouble for that and complained at length how it wasn't fair that he couldn't support his friend. Later he tried to frame the target of the attack so that the target would get exiled and the foreign ninja could more easily attack him to steal his eyes. He didn't do a good job of it, so he got caught and got in serious trouble and ended up quitting because he was being \"forced\" to work against his friend. Pretty much everyone in the ANBU was like that and it was really just a way for people to access secrets and make trouble. When the kage disbanded the entire ANBU because they were so sick of this bullshit, people were again **UPSET** and filed 10,000 complaints to the mods.\n\nIn a different group, someone was very upset that their personal character arc wasn't approved. From the sound of it, their idea of a personal arc was that the village would be bombed/attacked every other week and only *they* could defeat this group that was terrorizing the village. I remember seeing some conversation along lines of \"If this group can be defeated single handedly by one genin then they're not strong enough to break in and cause damage in the first place.\" Later he tried to run an event for this anyway without approval. That got him kicked out and when the mods were dealing with cleaning up that and talking to others involved who were upset it turned out he had bamboozled two very new players into joining this plot arc with really misleading statements and lies. \n\nTowards the end of my time playing in this fandom, I joined a group that had pretty well established and clear rules for character abilities, backgrounds, and a combat system. But it seems that someone had decided to revise their character or retcon something or just force through some bullshit. I remember a genin claimed that the previous kage had ordered a (forbidden) ability implanted in him and that made him a secret super weapon and since he was a super weapon he was due certain respect and resources from the currrent kage, who called this out as bullshit. Then the genin threw a big fit accusing the kage of meta gaming and bullying and that turned into complaining about how unfair the game admin and their system were. \n\nI remember somewhere there was a group that was plotting against a village. One of the people they recruited ratted them out. When they were caught they claimed that they hadn't consented to this person ratting them out so they couldn't have done that without meta gaming *and* tried to argue that having come up with a plot gave them plot armor against that plot being disrupted. \n\nAnd that's just off the top of my head...",

I say, you want easy access?  \n\n\n**Join a village. Make a character** ***inside*** **of a village.**\n\nWe have caps on rogues, which, I feel, is the best decision, amongst other measures in place to assure quality.

            "body": "Haha thank you. And that's only the tip of the iceberg and I wasn't even a mod in most of those groups. It's also why I quit RPing in that fandom. Even when the mods are on top of things, even when the system is good and designed to prevent OP shit like EMS and untouchables in combat, there are just *SO MANY* shitty people in the fandom that it brings things down. The constant exposure to the OOC drama, griefing, and harassment is wearying to be around even if it didn't directly impact my character or me. \n\n&gt;Join a village. Make a character inside of a village.\n\nA lot of people did that and that's why that story of the ANBU getting shut down happened. But more than that people wanted things to be where their genin could walk into an unlocked room and pull a file folder with super secret classified information out of an unlocked desk and not have any barriers to this or have to put any effort into getting things. And there were also so many people trying to do this that the leadership wised up and took action like I said.\n\nI also forgot to mention that the ANBU in that story were all Leaf and there was a lot of competition for spots and promotions in that village. So what some people would do was join one of the smaller villages instead, make friends with someone in the Leaf, and then use that friendship to get something valuable to take back to their village to wave around while asking for a promotion. While this isn't a bad idea in general, the problems were in the execution and reactions to IC consequences. See most people weren't smart about how they were enabling their friends and got caught red handed and when faced with IC consequences for their character actions it resulted in huge fits of drama each time.",

            "body": "Why I typically don't like roleplaying with inexperienced or fresh outta Amino people. They like edgy characters, which are able to do the impossible and can be anything they want. \n\nWas he new to roleplaying? I sorta assumed that\n\nWops\n\nNow, this doesn't mean all of them are like this, but it is a large majority. \n\nHaving people who don't know the said topic of the rp as well is quite annoying, tho i don't doubt he knew about Naruto. It has a very big fanbase.\n\nOn one of the Naruto servers I'm in, the admins made a limit on Uchiha characters, as they are boring and overpowered. I agree with this, if not entirely wiping them out or taking direct control of them, like their an NPC only you can play as. So, if someone wants to fight the uchiha, the ballsy person on the server who likes op characters won't have it to absolutely ruin someone's day. You can merely just make them run off and avoid violence.\n\nOr the simple option, just make it a character. \n\nRps based off of animes/games/mangas etc etc tend to get a little iffy. Most people want to be as op as the main character(if the main character is op), or sometimes even more. \nIts quite a large problem, among all franchises and websites for rping. I get why ppl do it, they wanna be col n stuff like the main, but that's not how it works.\nI have grown out of the 'edgy brink of deity' characters, into the more basic levels. I tend to use jonin of a medium level, and was recently working on a genin character.\n\n\nAnd don't use dice systems. Just do it when your out of options. Its not fun for anyone, having to get numbers slapped on your face and at the mercy of a dice. Imo, dice systems are a little on the unfair side, giving characters that are meek a possible advantage over someone of high power. Like kid Naruto trying to beat Kakashi.\n\nNot gonna happen.\n\nWell i think I'm done now. There's no way I'm gonna fall asleep, so if you ever need any help my sleep deprived arse is sitting right here. I'd be glad to, if you so choose.",
