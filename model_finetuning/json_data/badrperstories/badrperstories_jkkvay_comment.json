He also couldn't walk and was extremely sickly. I made him a healer because it was the one thing that didn't require physical strength. I then used him to point out the inherent flaws in hybridizing characters irp until the mods made a rule that no one could have a character that was a mix of more than two species. It was probably annoying AF for some people, and he was effectively scrapped because of the rule change, but it was really fun.",
