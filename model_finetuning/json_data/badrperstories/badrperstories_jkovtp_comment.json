But is it really *that hard* to tell your partner the reason? Like, many people are understanding, and it would end up much better in the end- because usually when people ghost other roleplayers, those roleplayers aren't gonna be too fond of the person anymore.  \n\n\nLike, recently I found someone who wanted to rp with me and we got to discussing everything- it went fine! Everything was good. Then I showed her my characters and she like, ghosted me after that. Usually, I wouldn't care, if she ghosts me it's not meant to be- but the worst part was this...  \n\n\nShe literally made a post the next day- usually, I won't see it, but we're on the same subreddit and I looked at her ad because I was still looking for people to rp with and it sounded good to me- but upon reading more, and going to message her- I realized this was the same girl that ghosted me before. The thing was... she literally titled the post something along the lines of:  \n\n\n**\"Looking For Rp Partners Who Won't Ghost Me\"**  \n\n\nSeems a little like... ironic, or hypocritical, yeah?",
