            "body": "I pretty much do the same thing whenever I'm really into an RP, even when I don't have the energy to post to it. I think chronic daydreaming is fairly par for the course for RPers, so don't feel like an obsessed weirdo just because you do this! I've talked to others and several people do it as well. (But also look up maladaptive daydreaming, if you haven't already.)\n\nIt sounds like you have a pretty great partner who is burned out. The way things are right now, *everyone* is stressed out. For some that means more need for RP, more inspiration, more passion to write. For others, it means burnout and fatigue.\n\nI suggest a little break for both of you. Discuss how long - a week, a month? - and if you would like, use that time to do some solo-writing or crank out imagines for characters and plots. Then you have some ideas to bring to her when you guys start back up again. It might also help to try something new in terms of characters and plot!\n\nObviously you can also talk to her frankly. \"You mentioned you feel your characters have been less 'real' lately. Why do you think that is? Are you uninspired for our stories, or for writing? You can be honest with me, I promise.\" A discussion is pretty important, because while it's impossible to snap your fingers and *not* feel annoyed by her low-effort and the decreased quality of the RPs, it's also not a healthy dynamic for you two. Maybe during the break you could just shoot ideas back and forth together and not do any posts, if it won't contribute to her burnout.",

I have definitely looked into maladaptive daydreaming; I definitely don't think I am at that level, but it's something that I have been keeping tabs on and constantly checking in with myself about. I honestly think that it really is just me being *really* into a story, almost like one would be really into a novel or a show and so on, I just want to write and explore characters and everything. I'll definitely bring it up to her. It needs to be addressed.",
