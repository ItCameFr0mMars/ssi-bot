So he obviously was one of those people born during a time where everyone was racist to each other to a degree. His books are some of the best though and he was a big part in people\u2019s childhoods, he also helped develop a valve to drain blood when his son was in a car crash that caused bleeding on the brain, his son didn\u2019t end up needing it but it saved the lives of many more children. \n\nNot  quite sure what antisemetic means.\n\nPeople have flaws, sometimes they\u2019re  bad ones but that begs the question of whether or not they know what they were doing was wrong or simply did not care. He was a sweet dude from what I heard and knew from his books. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t approach people saying that they can\u2019t make characters based off people (irl or fiction, dead or alive) cause if you think about, every character is influenced or inspired by something their creator new. Copy pasta\u2019s that get raped are a different thing entirely.",

            "body": "I'm not saying that Roald Dahl was a completely bad person, everyone is of course, grey, no one is bad or good. He has definitely helped some people and I grew up on his books, but if you look at some of his books, you can literally see the blatant racism and antisemitism in it. In 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', the oompa loopas were African and they worked for Mr Wonka for legit beans- Of course, from what I've heard, it started off as a anti-racist novel, so I can't say that Dahl *was* racist.\n\nHowever, Roald Dahl was definitely antisemitic. Antisemitism is basically discrimination against Jewish people and I don't think I need to say much more than that, after all WW2, DID happen. He has been noted to say some awful awful things like how \"Hitler didn\u2019t just pick on them for no reason\". So, it's not just some \"flaws\", you shouldn't sugarcoat antisemitism by saying that it was a different time.\n\nIn times like these, we shouldn't say things like \"then again, it was a different time\" because we'd be making excuses for someone we've never known. Especially in times like these where the subject of race is a sorta... big. We should honestly condemn that kind of thing and not say \"but he did this or that\".\n\nI do understand that characters are all sorta reflections of real life people, but this is BSD we're talking about. Where characters have the names of real life authors and are pretty much blatant about how they're based off real people, it's not just inspired or loosely influenced. But, yes, r / pe shouldn't even come up when it's based off real people.",

In the beginning made me slightly uncomfortable, but I'm usually uncomfortable when it comes to literally anything, so I ended up brushing it off, I thought that I'd just get over it.\n\nRecent is definitely subjective, I agree, Roald Dahl might be a little more not-recent compared to Stephen King and Daniel Brown. \n\nAs for their portrayal of Roald Dahl, they completely ignored his antisemitism and portrayed him as a kind, timid sort of person? At least from what I read of him on his OC form. I never picked him, I'd gone for someone else if we were going to rp *shrug*\n\nAnd I sent a total of two paragraphs (maybe 3-5 sentences to this person. I messaged them with 1 paragraph, saying that maybe they shouldn't use such recent figures, as in some of them being still alive. They replied with around 10-14 paragraphs in return. My last message was also one paragraph and I told them that it wasn't my place to say what they should or shouldn't do, that it's just in bad taste because they were real people. So, I don't think it was  that much in comparison to how much they went off on me?\n\nAnd as for the roleplay, it wasn't the sort of usual thing where we set up rules and triggers and the like.

I'm iffy about how this person had created a character based off of Roald Dahl, real person (this is fine), an antisemitic author who passed away less than 50 years ago (this is not fine, but they can continue to rp him), had him raped, which is where I draw the line.\n\nAnd sorry, I was thinking of Lovecraft when I was saying Roald Dahl was racist.

            "body": "Is not one of the main characters of the series, Osamu Dazai based on the famous author who had multiple suicide attempts in his short and tragic life, and finally died together with his lover by suicide? And in the series, he often tries to commit suicide in a comical manner? He has not passed away a hundred years ago either, he killed himself after publishing his book ningen shikkaku in 1948. His daughter Yuko was still alive when Bungou Stray Dogs was published, she passed away in 2016. The chance that she saw this is higher than Stephen King going into a roleplay forum and looking at other people's Ocs, or Roald Dahl's relatives finding out about it.\n\nThis does not sound very respectful to me either. It is okay to have boundaries and think 'Yikes, giving an OC a backstory like that is in poor taste'. But going into a fandom like this and then criticising people for basically doing what the people who made the manga/ anime did themselves will likely not go very well with people. The whole series is based on exaggerating certain traits, a lot of it can probably be viewed as in poor taste if you take a closer look at it. \n\nEither you view every OC through the same lense of: this is just based on the author, he/she is not actually meant to be an accurate representation of this person (like the dozens of anime/manga characters who are based on Jack the Ripper, a real murderer who killed real women), or you don't, but if you do not you should also criticize the source material.\n\nI don't think that making Mary Shelley afraid of men is less respectful than making suicide jokes about an author who has committed suicide.\n\n It is okay if this makes you feel uncomfortable, and for you not to roleplay it. But if I was this person, and I was attacked out of nowhere while the source material basically does the same, I would probably be like 'What, this is basically the premise of the source material?' and disregard your opinion.",

Sorry, I'm a bit skdjkdka at the moment, but I'll clarify that I didn't use those words specifically, I did try to put it as gently as possible and used as many euphemisms as I could to not upset them too much. I did say that the person they chose to base their oc off of was an antisemitic one, but that was all (my main concern was more to do with the authors that were still alive that she based her ocs off of, and even then, the most I really said was that it *might* be in bad taste to do this sort of thing). I didn't go off about it or anything, it was more of a \"hey, you do realise he was this kind of person, right?\" Though, I felt like that it didn't come off very well on text.\n\nI do understand why I was blocked, I was just venting about how RPF on recent/authors that are still alive is a little offputting to me.",
