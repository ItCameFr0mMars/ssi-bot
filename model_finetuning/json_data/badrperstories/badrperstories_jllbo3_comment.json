            "body": "I really want to play the devil's advocate here. Does a *character* talking about sex, or invoking sexual mental imagery, necessarily mean that the *writer* behind him/her/them is pushing for 'sexy times'? Because I don't think so. Unless the other writer has consistently shown to go for it in previous stories, of course, that's a different story, but if it's a stranger then I usually give them the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't sound like any OOC talking was done to discover his intent, guess we'll have to make do with mere *interpretations*.\n\nAnd mine is different from yours - I think it fits a character described as *earthy*, to casually bring up sexual topics. The intent could have been to elicit a strong reaction from your character, apparent shock/dismay or at least comment on it. \"Does he normally do this after saving a life?!\" for example.\n\nI think it could have led to an interesting conversation between the characters, and emphasize on the class divide. It could have turned out that group marriages among the proles are encouraged by the ruling class, to make it harder for plebs and nobles to fraternize and thus preserve the social hierarchy - what with the working class seen by aristocrats as simple-minded people, who are \"little more than animals by giving in to their basic desires/instincts\", while the latter are seen by the former as \"unfeeling robots\". It could have given room for character growth as well - his realizing that poly might be fine and dandy, but there's just something so much more *special* and connecting if it's a mono relationship, with your aristocrat in particular. Same with sex - to have an epiphany that the less casually he treats it, the more meaningful it becomes and the more one can talk about it being a *union*... rather than just getting his rocks off.\n\nOr I could be completely wrong and, had you given in to address it, Vicky could have followed it up with \"Cool! Wanna take a shower together, too?\" :D Who knows.",
