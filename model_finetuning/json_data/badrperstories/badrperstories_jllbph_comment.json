I, personally, find this to be interesting. My male moderators have never been told to soften their speech or use emojis to clarify when they're speaking with directness, however I, as the Admin and Owner, of my server have been on the receiving end of some very aggressive clap-backs for using the exact same tonality. Most of what my male moderators say or have said have been copied and pasted directly from me, and it's not a problem.   \n\n\nThis may not seem like an RP Bad, but it is a general bad and I think it's relevant to the RP community so we can keep growing as writers.",

Not to soften my speech, but because I learned English this way and it sounds right for me to include them in my speech.\n\n\\-No, I won't stop now. It is the easiest way to communicate and explain my thoughts, why should I unlearn it?\n\n\\-by learning English at school.\n\n\\-Yes, but I never thought it was a gender specific thing. Also many people assume that I am a man regardless of this, so I don't know.\n\n\\-No. I usually write male characters, and I write them according to their personality. For example, a shy male character with a creative mind will be more polite and add a lot of qualifiers, someone who is a brute will have more short sentences. I have not written many rps in English though. Nobody ever complained.\n\nIn general, it seems like in my country, emojis seem to be necessary regardless of gender. A male friend of mine once said to me 'people who don't use emojis always seem like they are angry or a bit like psychopaths.' Of course he was exaggerating, but in my circles, it always seemed like something nearly everyone does, no matter what gender they are. And people got weirded out by other people in chats who were not using them at all. \n\nI also once told a friend of mine that he should soften his speech a little and use more emojis, because many people were confused whether he was serious or not sometimes, and it made it easier for them to see 'Ah, this was meant to be a joke'.There where a lot of misunderstandings and this helped to avoid them. \n\nMy opinion is that emojis are basically just a stand-in for the expressions you make when you are talking to someone. While you might be typing something with a smile on your face, your partner obviously can't see that when you are communicating in a chat. So adding this can make your intent a little bit more clear.\n\nI would never tell someone they are more bitchy, nagging, and so on if they don't use them or qualifiers. I would probably just ask 'was this a joke?' or 'are you serious right now?' a lot more often, and in general there would be more misunderstandings, or at least I think so.",

I do believe that speech has \"feminine\" and \"masculine\" qualities, and you can infer a lot about an internet stranger in the way they text, but I don't like to make assumptions. I try not to worry about sounding too straightforward, but I know it is important for many of my friends. Excessive use of qualifiers can indicate insecurity and uncertainty. My use of modifiers ramps up when I ask questions or petition etc. Like you say, it's an affectation; it all has to do with how we have been socialized to make ourselves smaller and weaker.\n\nI exclusively write characters that are men, all from cultures that emphasize traditional masculinity. A big part of writing a character like this is demonstrating an awareness of their psychology while also avoiding a heavy-handed portrayal (one that is not genuine--like a caricature). To be honest, I would not be able to synthesize their speech *without* examples from literature. As much as I can be in that \"headspace,\" speech with a distinctly masculine energy doesn't come naturally, and it is difficult for me to replicate without inspiration.",

I've played men who have softer thoughts and speech and women who have harder thoughts and speech. I've never considered the usage of qualifiers to be of focus to either gender specifically or in more abundance but instead based off personalities which I usually classified at the core as 'hard' or 'soft', as well to convey emotion and direct responses.\n\n\\-( Bonus ) Emojis do not come off as exceptionally feminine to me ( unless pressured heavily in some cases ) but more of an intent to convey friendliness from my experience?\n\nThis is an interesting take that I wasn't aware of regarding these words. To me their inclusion has always been a way to convey, as hinted earlier, a more human nature of speech. Absolute certainty and absolute statements are rather mechanical to me; they don't convey any emotion whatsoever beyond the actual lack of for me, besides a nature of strictness. Go figure a lot of people I have role-played with in the past who have had English as a secondary language have shown a lack of using them, but  I felt it was just a personal choice.\n\nIt's the difference of strictly business and casual conversation in my mind; I'm direct when giving someone tasks or orders ( when appropriate in my workplace or other organized tasks ) but in casual conversation in typing ( especially in writing ) I do often include them to represent possibility. I feel the lack of should be used for impact, while the usage is for the norm.\n\n'Something will be done about that'.\n\n'Something will probably be done about that'.\n\nThe tone is different for both almost like one is a comment and another is a direct promise. To me it's always been the intent and not so much gender or a nature of subordination versus authority, unless specifically emphasized for either.\n\nMaybe to me it translates differently. I can understand the implication though. I have however dealt with moderators both male and female who act too mechanical when the nature of the issue is not nearly as severe as it warrants. Or it's a honest mistake; go figure each situation is it's own. Regardless it is the interpterion that matters the most per the individual person.\n\nThis does make me think more on it but my personal views remain relatively the same, I suppose save for inspiring me to notice them more often now.",

In my OOC negotiations and brainstorming these words do come up a lot to actually imply a level of possible sway. \n\nIt does make a lot of sense.\n\nRegarding your issues with people asking you to tone it down or 'use emojis'; it's silly. To me it's almost, well, a sign of sensitivity that is fragile. I've dealt with language barriers, people who have dyslexia, and all sorts who have had interesting ways of conveying their feelings and thoughts, as well as their writing. In that case I'd simply tell them to, as you've coined the term, eat dicks. \n\nEspecially in regards to the admin issue; the job of moderators and above is to establish and present authority regardless of gender and the best way is often direct with no implication of leeway. If one is aware someone is 'sensitive' and requires a finer touch to address and that should be considered, but only if it is a worthwhile endeavor and an earnest one. \n\nI do not know what sort of situations invoked these clap-backs from your users, but it sounds like either you're unlucky with dealing with those that lack the ability to deal with authority OR do not directly respect your authority.",

            "body": "Dutch Euro-girl here, only about 290km removed from ye olde Great Brittain\u2019s closest town with some salty water in between! Whilst I might not be English (or I might somewhere in my genes, my grandma I never knew was an avid Detectives fan and English teacher together with my knighted great aunt) by blood, I do have an affinity for the language and did score an almost-perfect Native score for writing on the Cambridge test. Even briefly tried becoming an English Teacher myself!\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s see under the ladies section:\n\n\n1. Frequent traits or \u201cqualifiers\u201d? Use of emojis? OOC and IC? Well when it comes to IC, not really\u2014 or at least, not how you might initially expect it.\n\n\nYou see, I have a gigantic range of OCs and monsters for nearly every occasion or scenario. I also write Actions in a sort of screenplay-like way, which allow you to add tones or mannerisms directly into the dialogue of a character.\n\n\nHence, the need for emoticons is sort of overdue par for one character of mine: a roughly 30x30x30 sphere of genderless alien blue flaming diamond with black blots that represent it\u2019s eyes. This OC is mostly a sort of comic relief, and it\u2019s sometimes funny to inject the mannerisms tab with a quick [(^^)]. Many ironically refer to them as a guy, maybe because of their blue colour. Though you could literally refer to them as a duck and they\u2019d **roll** with it\u2014 well, if they weren\u2019t afraid of ducks that is.\n\n\nAs for the \u201cqualifiers\u201d, I sorta only reserve them for accents, age, origin or theme surrounding a character. For example: one of my older male teacher OCs with a \u201cBritish\u201d background, I do ironically use a ton of \u201cqualifiers\u201d. He\u2019s a kind and wise man, rather fatherly, yet soft and open. Forgiveness is his middle name, and whilst he can fight, he\u2019d rather not for both his approachability and the fact that he\u2019s slowly dying due to a heart-based Sci-Fi disease which often brings him to his knees if his blood pressure is too high.\n\n\nAnother male OC, that of a red-headed futuristic rebel with Scottish-American roots, somewhere in his mid-20\u2019s and proud to be straight (but accepting and friends with other flavours as well). He tries to be slick, look cool and strong, and is a fan favourite around kids for seeming so awesome to them. He... actually uses a metric ton of \u201cqualifiers\u201d. You see, he\u2019s got confidence issues and he knows it. See him as a sort of grown-up Marty McFly. He wants to be seen as kind, as capable, and as a stylish gentleman that can make a girl laugh at his own expense if need be. His relationships are rocky and frequently end in break-up\u2019s, he literally has a killer Ex-girlfriend because their personalities didn\u2019t match in the slightest. I guess you could call him a \u201clucid simp\u201d? He\u2019s easily to abuse by the opposite sex, despite his rebel status. Yet, he still proves to be a fan favourite in many of my RP\u2019s!\n\n\nLastly, a girl OC of 16yo up to 18yo. A very smol bean (1.44m), also riddled with confidence issues and bucket loads of depression, trauma and self-loathing. They don\u2019t use \u201cqualifiers\u201d in their normal speech at all, only when they\u2019re opened up to talk about their pain like many other OCs of mine. Because they\u2019re so short, they tend to be overlooked if they don\u2019t actively try to stand out. They\u2019re punk-ish, shouty and seemingly cold to everyone they meet. Easily complains about the things around her and applies half-glass-empty speak to a lot of things. 100% cactus. Ironically, she\u2019s also the pupil of the first male OC with those \u201cqualifiers\u201d, and they don\u2019t push them to \u201cbe more girly\u201d. Instead, they simply hang out a lot and go on adventures that require the both of them to reflect on who they are as a person. Because she\u2019s young, grew up in a crowded tourist town, and honestly kinda dense, her accent and speaking style is very blunt, quick and \u201cfarmer\u201d-like. Though she is slowly beginning to try and speak like her teacher so that she can apply the same skill to situations on adventures where shouting at someone is not the best approach.\n\n\nNow, OOC, you can already see from what I\u2019ve typed that I use a metric ton of \u201cqualifiers\u201d myself! Though\u2014 it\u2019s not because people told me to sound like a soft girl. It\u2019s not something I got pushed onto me at school, nor in the OOC. Heck, my overapologetic tic often renders my sorries empty, meaningless and not that genuine. I\u2019m often advised by my girl and guy friends that I shouldn\u2019t bend to certain individuals and instead give it to them with everything I got. Show them some angry teeth, y\u2019know?\n\n\nIronically, the first time I talked in my OOC, people actually thought that I was a guy! Nevermind the \u201cqualifiers\u201d, the sorries, or the bright hello\u2019s I start off with. I find it quite funny and cute, not a problem at all. Sometimes I correct them after I see that they think I\u2019m a guy, and other times I sort of just let it slide for a while. Maybe a day, a week or even two! It\u2019s often blown someone\u2019s mind when I do mention being a girl, often only after the person asks me if they\u2019re approaching me in the correct manner. Even now it still happens. And I assure them that their previous assumptions are all well and good, plus that I was most likely in on the joke.",
