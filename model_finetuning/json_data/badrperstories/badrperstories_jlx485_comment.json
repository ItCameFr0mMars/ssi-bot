            "body": "I know when I started roleplaying, God-Moding was when someone would just constantly be deflecting or dodging attacks on their character while conveniently landing every single hit on their character's opponent. That said, it's been almost 2 decades since I started role playing, and I recognize that the definitions have probably changed.  \n\n\nWhat you described sounds to me like NPCing another person's character, which, yeah, is a big no-no. That's always been the case in the 19 years I've been role playing though. It's always been severely frowned upon for someone else to write in their post what another player's character is thinking, feeling, seeing, or hearing.   \n\n\nYou can absolutely get stuff done without playing someone else's character for them. It's not about being \"hyper vigilant,\" it's about \"get your hands off my character.\" Typically, if someone does that to my characters in a scene, I'll just write over it and outline that my character pointedly did not do the thing the other person said they did. Admittedly, that's pettier than just asking them to stop in OOC, but it gets the point across in an equally asinine way as the first person.   \n\n\nIt's better to just mention it in OOC like \"hey, these sounds are important, would you mind outlining in your post that your character is hearing them?\" Otherwise, you're basically implying that you can write their character better than they can, which outside of your niche group of friends, is generally seen as really F'ing rude.",

I write so a lot myself, like giving a certain User more info in an RP Action because their OC\u2019s skills, abilities, nature or jobs might allow for it.\n\n\nMy latest similar directing of a User OC\u2019s eyes was for a deduction section. A User\u2019s smith OC saw my OC constantly adjust a strange sigil ring with otherworldly language on it due to their sharp eyes, allowing him to figure out that my OC is approaching the end of his Latin and regrets some past actions that shortened his life. And also the other way around. I have OCs mention an ability or skill first, to help understand the User I\u2019m RP\u2019ing with that I\u2019d wish to hear some information about their OC or situation whilst referring back to their previous Action.\n\n\nIt\u2019s much better than the opposite which I\u2019ve experienced as well: being told or telling Users nothing because they should\u2019ve noticed it with their skills.\n\n\nLike \u201cwhat\u2019s that? Your character is a detective and has a fine eye for detail, tone, and lies? Well then I won\u2019t say if there\u2019s any even if there is, you\u2019re the detective anyway\u201d. I find stuff like that so unfair, and yet it comes from those that always think that they RP \u201cbetter\u201d than others. It\u2019s not like I went to crime school or Hogwarts, so the User shouldn\u2019t have to 100% become the OC.\n\n\nSo yeah! Quite a strange community you\u2019ve got there! If my first bit matches your RP style, then rest assure that you\u2019re not doing a bad job.",

There was no need for staff to scold you or for anyone to call that specific incident god-modding, IMO. A bit of an overreaction.  \n\n\nThat said, going forward, you can be more clear by using language like, \"If B listened closely, they would be able to hear strange sounds\" etc.",

            "body": "That's worrisome for me as in some roleplays I have where I'm the chat leader (essentially I set up the chat area, the theme and ploy idea, etc, and thus assume the role of DM) I tend to push influential comments to see if the other in the chat bites.\n\nNow, my partners are very lenient and we all do similar to each other and trust the other to handle things well, and that being said I don't Absolutely force those actions if it's not pertinent to the story I'm trying to have and is understood since I'm the one that set up the concept and extended the invitation. I leave response openings for them where they can either say no elsewhere or respond in a way that denies or alters my previous message and I work with that; I treat it like a DM trying to herd players with a plot hook without railroading too hard, and accept if they opt to ignore or defy those actions if they so choose.\n\nBut now I worry if that style is going to set off new partners because I nudged them the wrong way, especially if it's a result of writing style and not intended to be controlling.",
