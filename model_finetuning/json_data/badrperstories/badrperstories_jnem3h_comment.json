I'd try and find a way to politely disengage and seek out new partners who can bring that spark.",

Sometimes you end up not having as much compatibility with someone as you thought you did, and that's okay.\n\nI have similar stories, though they're mild. When I was new to rp I befriended someone writing a character from the same series as mine. As time went on I started to branch out and try writing different characters, and they did too, so we naturally wrote them together. That's when I started to notice that they wrote every character the same way. I wrote with 3-4 of their OCs and every one felt identical. I also realized the way their characters talked was the same way *they* talked in ooc chat. We're still acquaintances but we drifted apart as far as rp goes and don't write together anymore. \n\nSimilarly, I met someone who was writing loads of canon characters from my fandom and I was really excited because at the time no one else was writing them. Quickly realized that despite them having very unique personalities in canon there was virtually no telling them apart in her writing, and she did all the same plots with them. I ended up barely writing with her, which was a good thing because she ended up causing drama with a lot of people within the community.",
