Think your peep was way worse than mine but these be traits I believe nobody wants to see back in a fellow RP\u2019er.\n\n\nAnd yeah, Todd\u2019s got a real Superpower problem. Even if I\u2019m the User that owns the overall weakest Superpowered OCs, I do know and enjoy others that can handle their powers.\n\n\nNo joke, but for one of his other OCs (that all went by his real name which was also his username) I got a Google Drive document slam-dunked onto me regarding a Game-related Superpower that basically just broke a previous Amino\u2019s everything if it were approved as it included:\n\n- Character Creation: Basically full-on shapeshifting on a dime no matter the DNA, functions much alike Xenoplant\u2019s \u201cdodging\u201d as well.\n\n\n- Job Classes: Can learn any technique that\u2019s out there in a jiffy. Every. Even those of other Users, down to the movement, not limited by say the inability to produce a fiery chemical compound in your gut or juggle the enemy with four arms.\n\n\n- EXP/Loot: After an undetermined time of doing stuff, can add a multiplier to everything like attack, defense, skills, powers, etc, which becomes their new base stats. Will always get the items of a defeated foe, replica or not. Yes, even User OCs.\n\n\n- Multiplayer Mode: Can create an unspecified number of clones that all are just as strong and effective as the original.\n\n\n- NPC Creation: Alternatively, can just copy your OC and ship himself with them.\n\n\n- Splitscreen: **Definitely didn\u2019t rip off one of my other OCs\u2019 lone Sightjacking ability minus the weaknesses of being blind yourself when using it, a specified range it works at and the need to trigger it by trauma which doesn\u2019t work when drugged out with the simplest of prescriptions.**\n\n\n- Level Editor: Complete control over the chat terrain down to any material or object.\n\n\n- Final Boss: Might as well be a God as he gets the unnamed stats of one.\n\n\n- Skill Tree: Infinite list of skills and other Superpowers that may or may not already exist from other Users which he can immediately pick up after purchasing it without qualifications nor a learning curve.\n\n\n- Jumpscare: If the OC gets caught off-guard, que the next skill \u201cCutscene\u201d.\n\n\n- Cutscene: An uninterruptible event that can\u2019t be evaded or blocked, which leads to him puppeting the OC trapped in it to get hit, miss an attack or even just straight up die.\n\n\n- Pause: Much alike Lich\u2019s slowed Time Perception ability, but it\u2019s now flatout paused meaning that he could calculate his next move for eons to come instead of less than half a minute.\n\n\n- Appraisal: Blatant metagaming without a good reason as he literally gifts his SIOC self the wiki to the OC opponent.\n\n\n- QTE: Slows time for only the enemy down to a crawl but speeds himself up for an unmentioned amount of time to beat the crap outta the opponent.\n\n\n- Mini-map: You can\u2019t sneak up on him, effectively run away or even hide in anonymity as he will always know your location, name, health, status effects, you name it.\n\n\n- Hacking/Cheat Codes: ... literally does away with any weaknesses or inconveniences he has on his powers, health, weapons, etc. Can even cheat another to death or back to life.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just too damn much..! All this is one Superpower according to him?! I couldn\u2019t even pass a few if I could since some of them on their own are just absurdly OP on their own!\n\n\n[=_=] And then I\u2019m called a self-absorbed sociopath for not approving it...",

Some of those are actually really cool and would make excellent unlocks or BBEG powers, but all at once? \"Hey, I wanna be an admin without actually earning the admin status\" basically.\n\nYou mentioned some of your OCs are very weak, and Lich is the most broken, and while she does seem to have a lot of powers it absolutely makes sense that 1) Dr Who, there's all kinds of funky stuff going on behind the scenes there and alien civilizations probably have things we can't comprehend so of course a space-time traversing quasi-immortal being will have access to it; and 2) it absolutely makes sense that said quasi-immortal being has spent eons honing and perfecting their abilities and equipping themselves appropriately for the situation and to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nYou at least had the courtesy to list all of Lich's perks in a public space for anyone to notice and account for. You also seem like you're able to handle a strong OC by balancing them with weaknesses or at the very least compelling writing (to believe characters designed to be OP don't require overt weaknesses if they're a well written character or have moral hang ups, personally).\n\nSo OF COURSE that genre wrecking power gaming garbage fire was denied!
