But because you don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d certain things, that doesn\u2019t mean you can be an ass and say trans men and intersex men aren\u2019t real men. I don\u2019t care if you like taller guys! I said I didn\u2019t mind making my character taller- but then they shamed short people. \n\nLike as a trans and also kinda short guy that kinda thing makes me uncomfortable. \n\nJust because a person or character doesn\u2019t fit your standards doesn\u2019t mean they are inferior or you are allowed to shame them. And that\u2019s the truth.",
