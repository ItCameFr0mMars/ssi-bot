The genre is unspecified, but it seems to have some fighting component in it so I have guess it is some kind of fictional like roleplay but you are trying not to center it over fights but physical confrontation is allowed (you mentioned this guy character do not dialogue much and just \"Attack\". Feel free to say I am wrong as I had to assume these notions).\n\nI have unfortunately experienced something like you describe. You have a draining and bad roleplayer at hand (this player focus mainly over himself and doesn't look for cooperation with other people as he just fight his way to success), but since he's the most active member, I think you fear the community will just turn into something where to say \"so quiet\" \"this place is dead\" etc.\nHowever I invite you to look at it in a different way: I think your players (not the bad one) see as clear as you this guy is a problem, and they most likely want it removed. If you keep stalling, you most likely end up having the good players leave because they are not having fun, and ultimately the bad player, unless there is a fresh or a solid batch of new players, will get bored and leave too because no one is fawning over his bad roleplay/he fought and killed any other character.\n\nMy first piece of advice is to take control of the situation and execute your power as host. You can tell this player his behaviour has to change because he just attacks other characters and doesn't collaborate. If you opt for this route, make sure to do it in dms or in a private way. There is no need to start a public witch hunt against a player, plus it gives you a sort of bad image.\n\nIf you want, you can add rules to the basic ones if you feel like to avoid confrontation and make sure to prevent futher bad players, I have some in my storage and I will make sure to give them to you if you feel like adding them (just ask me for them in a possible reply). Trust me they are easy to comprehend, and so accessible even to new players.\n\nIf he gets over the top and the diplomatic route fails, removing him is still a thing.\nTrust me in this, it is better to have 3 good players rather than 100 bad ones, and your good players will show support if you give reasons for you removing him. \n\nPlus... There is a post around this thread where there are countless places to advertise your roleplay group! Try one out if you feel like it, I am sure your community will pick the interest of a stranger and they may join your community!\n\nAnd that's it, I hope it helps!",

I didn't think that the genre mattered, but it is fantasy based. It's like a mix of modern stuff like phones and guns, as well as stuff like dragons and demons and fairies. I wanted it to be a place where people can be as creative as they want to be, so everything's very loose. \n\nI've warned him a couple times about fixing the length of his posts and another mod has talked to him about proper grammar and such, but I just thought that if I were to kick him, it'd seem like an overreaction, ya'know? I don't want to seem like some sort of dictator who'll kick anyone immediately. \n\nI'll definitely check out the threads! One of the other members suggested that they could help advertise it, so that's fun. Thanks for the advice!",

But I turned out to be right about that person, that ultimately done a felony worth the breaking of the roleplay board ToS. I gave my fellow owner the biggest \"I told you so\" and then we returned be friends.\nFrom that moment on I got a rule that goes like \n\n\"The admins reserve themselves the right to punish those who are distrupting the quietness and chilliness of the server how they see fit. This doesn't mean the server is going to be ruled by tyrants, have faith in the admins that monitor the situation as we won't use our powers unless in dire necessities that may put the health of the server at stake. \nIt is for our and your relax sake that this rule was implemented.\"\n\nAnd I also have some other neat rules if you want to hear about them. I love freedom of creativity as much as you do, but some people tend to abuse the faith mods give them. It is your job to put a stop when people cross the line",

I've done it for others before. The bogey also encourages more play overall, so that by the time they leave or the character is killed off, your overall story is healthy enough to survive and it's back on track. I've only seen it fail once where the bogey got vindictive and tried to get the character she was baiting fired and removed from play - so definitely use a bogey player you trust and who isn't already involved in the server so they're not going to get attached to their character if/when the time comes to pull out.",
