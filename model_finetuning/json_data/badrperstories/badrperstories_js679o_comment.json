I\u2019ve done it once before (although not with all the Lemon!) with a Monster Arc, scaring one User so badly that I accidentally gave them a panic attack and had them crack their phone in half, because I noted some of their personal fears from the OOC and weaved it into the RP. Unintentionally killing their OC by killing their phone.\n\n\n[o-o\u201d] Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve apologized and offered to compensate their phone..! Their OC even got reanimated 6 months after that Arc ended.\n\n\nTodd was hence the second person to experience a mix of IRL and IC after the previous guy. And it had quite an effect.",

            "body": "[\\^\\^]Daw, thanks!\n\n\n[\u2022 \u2022] I myself always try to keep my RP Actions sort of fair by riddling them with details alluding to possible betrayal. Mostly because just saying you spiked someone\u2019s drink is too blatant and effortlessly dodgeable, but not announcing that you even have a poison until it hits because that\u2019s cheap and unfair.\n\n\nHence, I did actually put the poisonous makeup on her list of items and weapons because Todd wanted to use that overrated T1-RM RP Combat method he was \u201ctaught\u201d by Narc Agent. And in Lich\u2019s wiki, I even detail her main method of deception and the contradicting clues to pick up when I play as her.\n\n\nLike her species\u2019 ability to swap eyecolours and patterns. She always proudly wears her natural golden amber eyes with these strange crimson cracks in the irises that flux with her slow heartbeats because they represent a fearsome mythical status known to a lot of people on her bad side. I wrote that when she\u2019s trying to deceive someone with sweet words, she might swap her eyes for comfy brown ones of which the cracks are still vaguely visible if you look hard at them enough. The flux will speed up when she lies or gets closer to her assumed victory. And she\u2019ll blink far more often than when she\u2019s just being herself, as she normally rarely blinks which helps to stave off certain statues from moving when you can\u2019t see them.\n\n\nOr if she unnecessarily files her nails/rubs her mouth with her hand or sleeve. That\u2019s a big sign of danger, since that means that she\u2019s removing the protective coat on her poisonous lipstick or breaking off tiny bits of poisonous nailpolish to perhaps spike a drink with. Or just give you a good sharp scratch and see you fall.\n\n\nSo a lotta tells. Sorta like a book cleverly slipping in announced details about something secret happening later that you might overlook, yet of which you\u2019re aware when you know they\u2019re there.\n\n\n[XD] You wouldn\u2019t believe how many times Users don\u2019t pick up on inconsistencies, even the big ones like what announced clothes they\u2019re wearing in one scene and then another. Or suddenly having unnaturally coloured eyes, a strange accent, different dominant hands, perhaps even a completely new face or hints at an affliction they might have or have not.\n\n\n[@-@] But once they\u2019re aware of it, like my Slav Friend watching this fight unfold in the OOC and knowing that the poison will be used... well, you basically have Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s famous words on how to build a satisfying twist and everlasting suspense!",

I'm the kind of person who pauses movies and videos to check if there is some sort of easter egg, and I tend to hint some stuff myself as I desire my players to think about why did I placed a word here and there, why does that person do something etc. It requires some minimum focus on the scene and if the player reads the moviment well, they are rewarded. Then there are the times when I worldbuild something and I have no idea on what to do so I improvise lol but that's something off topic...\n\nUltimately what my \"friends\" done was basically cheat and brew a super poison untraceable they placed on someone elses food and after 3 or four people ate that food they said whoops now everyone dies. Kinda cheaty to me. You did not cheat (you placed your poison in the wiki and emoted it to be activated) and you could teach 'em how it's done a good plot twist. \nMy \"friends\" cheated coz they wanted people dead\n\n(Ps I call friends a group of people that I met in my first roleplay days. I broke contact with them a long time ago but i still call em \"friends\" to underline their hypocrisy)",

            "body": "Oof, yeah they don\u2019t perticularly sound like fun friends to RP a community story with. I myself frown on Users trying to kill other OCs in general outside of maybe a special RP detailing that it\u2019s allowed, because there are a ton of things to write about together that don\u2019t involve fighting or killing your buds \u201cjust because\u201d.\n\n\nI can\u2019t see the fun in just Powergaming a lethal poison in a dish that narratively didn\u2019t need nor deserve it if it\u2019s not connected to an arc of any kind.\n\n\n[\u2022-\u2022] Maybe it\u2019s because when playing pretend as a kid, my little sis always gave me a villain role and had invincible shields and mega lazers whilst I wasn\u2019t allowed any. (We don\u2019t RP together anymore to this day).\n\n\nJust like you, narrative clues and hints are my jam. Hidden references, motives for future crimes playing out in the moment, small causes and effects, red herrings, you name it. Grew up loving old-timey adventure and mystery films, and that\u2019s shaped my own writing style over the years.\n\n\n[@-@] When used in your writing, it can make anything infinitely stronger and more memorable than any \u201cjust use T1-RM RP Combat to win the fight\u201d advice anybody can get!",

            "body": "I do not kill characters unless they are completely and utterly failing to comply to rules, that is my usual policy. I mean where is the fun of killing someone else's work? There are so many things one can do to a defeated character, that killing is supposedly the most useless among all.  \nAnd I completely agree with any other point you made... I am glad we share a common vision. In any case my first post was about these \"friends, you can check it out right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i9q3c0/how_parasites_can_infect_your_server_and_your_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you want to, but I understand it waters down details as I tried to compress two years in there... However it is one of the most complex anthologies of bad roleplay I ever found myself in. In case you're going to read it, happy reading XD  \nPs: Still waiting for part three like a kid their promised candies lol (Jk, take your time)",
