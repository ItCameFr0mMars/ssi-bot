Physical Abuse or immediately jumping to getting physical. A slap on the ass is pretty standard but if they immediately start the rp trying to hit your character, choke them, punch them etc with no foreplay probably a bad sign. And immediately jumping into sex. No foreplay no nothing they are already trying to penetrate probably a bad sign? But these are just my opinions so take them with a grain of salt.",

Although likely more\n\nIve never encountered any issues yet I keep hearing people whine about how horrifying ERP's are. Maybe you guys aren't being confident enough in stating your boundaries?\n\nIt really isn't that hard, post a prompt in dirtypenpals or any other sub or website where you can get rp partners. List your limits and kinks in the prompt, provide an interesting story - by writing high quality prompts you already filter out a lot of shitty people. \n\nWait for the responses to come in an ignore any responses that don't seem respectful enough - don't take it too seriously. If you get weird guys in your messages \"hey do u want me to make u cum?\" \"No. Have a nice day\" and thats it. \n\nIf someone ignores a limit in a story, just ignore them? It is a roleplay, not a real life thing, no one's gonna die. Move on to the next partner.\n\nWhat might help a bit is if you write in first person, to only roleplay in third to keep the distinction between the roleplay and yourself a little more clear and to never use self inserts.",

If the player is turned off by something in the \"planning phase\" better to scrap the idea and propose something else. Beside that, everything is fair in love and ERP.\n\nI also suggest to look [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/ip0mgp/bad_rper_or_just_bad_lover/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) as I asked for some advice from the original poster and this person turned out to be super helpful!
