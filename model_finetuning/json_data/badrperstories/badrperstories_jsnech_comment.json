A lot of role players aren\u2019t the best at pacing, so once the first sexual encounter happens, they\u2019re not sure where to go from there. This is especially true for people who haven\u2019t developed their characters well, yet; they just don\u2019t know where to go from here.\n\nI do think it would have been better to talk to the person about the issue if that\u2019s the only problem you had. If it\u2019s not been long, it\u2019s probably not too late to add them back and talk it through \u2014 but only if you want to try and keep writing with them.",
