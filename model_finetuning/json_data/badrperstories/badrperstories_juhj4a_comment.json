Or just flat tell them that this isn't working out for you and don't give then a reason. I have never ghosted anyone.

Dude, triggers are a serious thing, but I feel like these days people really do claim that every random thing is a trigger just for attention- it makes people with actual triggers that make complete sense look bad... like why would you be triggered by \"oof\" because it is a phrase that is said too often? Like damn. Maybe I just don't get it or something, but I feel like that seems weird?  \n\n\nAlso the second conversation you described is literally hair pulling painful, ngl, like- I get not being a social person or knowing how to talk to other people as well, you don't have to be the most social person ever! But that's like... kinda really draining that every conversation goes like that. Especially stating in your ad that you want to talk ooc and having someone come to you that's like that, I can see why that can be annoying. They absolutely sound uninterested, about you as a person really, if the rp is fine they probably just are there because they want to rp and nothing more- but even that, if they seem uninterested in plotting ideas, they probably are barely interested in the RP itself either. Or, they are literally using you to vent *their* issues without caring about yours. Venting of course is also okay, but you should always ask the person you would be venting to first- like, it sounds like they just start sharing all their personal information that can be uncomfortable to sit and listen to without asking you- but then you try to change the subject, they don't care anymore. Like who knows, maybe they really are having a hard time, but it gets really draining to you as their rp partner that they constantly are venting it on to you. Maybe they are just doing it for attention? Sadly, these days, there's always people who do stuff for attention- so sadly, it's always a possibility.  \n\n\nIt's always hard to drop people like this because they'll always pull the \"now I'm sad boohoo how dare you\" thing- just to make you feel bad and just to make you stay, because they're once again is that possibility they're using you for something. But you shouldn't have to be forced to stay, dude- like, you shouldn't feel obligated to stay when they make you feel mentally drained and all. I'd say you have to try to talk to them again, tell them exactly how you feel and be honest. Tell them again that look, this isn't working- I'm sorry, but we don't mesh well together and keeping this going is really hard on myself, I hope you understand. It's good to be a nice person to people- but at the same time, if they make you feel not your best, it's good to put your foot down. Tell them that you just can't rp with them anymore, tell them about how you don't like the dry ooc conversations and all, and all that went wrong- and then try to tell them that if they still want to rp, there's plenty of people out there who would probably be interested in rping with you, just tell them to make their own ad and all and they're set.   \n\n\nDon't let them guilt trip you into staying. If they try to, it's best to just leave. Other people *are* important, but you are even *more* important, don't do stuff that makes you feel like *blargh*, and then don't push yourself to put up with it. I feel like you both just need partners you mesh better with, and that should be that.   \n\n\nI wish you good luck with this! You got a very hard situation on your hands.",

She would never ask questions, not even stuff like 'how are you?', I went to the hospital and when I wrote her that I have to be staying in the hospital she just wrote 'ok', and did not ask what was wrong. Which would be okay, I am open to not chatting ooc, but she would write me every single day, multiple times.\n\nEvery conversations was just:\n\nshe: 'hey'\n\nme: ' hey, how are you?'\n\nshe: 'fine'\n\nme: 'cool, did you watch the movie you wanted to watch yesterday?'\n\nshe: 'yeah'\n\nme: 'was it good? I wanted to watch it some day, it sounds interesting'\n\nshe: 'was okay'\n\nme: 'great, I will watch it then'\n\nshe: 'yeah'\n\nI would desperately try to have a conversation with her, but all her replies were along the lines of 'ok', 'yeah', 'wow', '\\^\\^' and 'mhm'. But if I just stopped replying and only wrote in our rp, she would be like 'where are you???' after one day. The only topics she would discuss were:\n\n\\-that she has problems with her weight and therefore no one wanted to be friends with her because everyone is so superficial\n\n\\-or telling me how much someone else who seemed to be her friend annoyed her, how her other partner was soo bad (and she went and insulted him so bad that I felt terrible for him), or all the draining chores she had to do and how much her family sucked.\n\nThat was it. Every other topic was met with: 'ok', 'aha', and 'mhm'.\n\nThe roleplay was the same, she never got excited about anything, and it seemed just like another chore for her. I just told her that weren't a good match as writing partners. Suddenly, she wanted me to stay, and I did. She left some weeks later lol",

(And yes, I mean actual trigger, I spiral hard when it is used a lot.)  \n\n\nWithout going into too much detail and getting too much off topic, a very abusive person would use \"ok\" exclusively in text whenever they were unhappy with me, and I knew it would always lead to dire consequences down the road. When they were not in a foul mood or I had \"done something wrong\", they wrote it like \"Okay\". So whenever I encounter a person who just writes \"ok\" (all lower caps, only those two letters), my mind immediately goes to a dark place where I am assuming that this person will hold me responsible for some slight I don't understand, and I go to a very dark place emotionally and start worrying about what I did and how to make the anxiety go away/how to make it right by them.  \n\n\nSome triggers might seem silly to others, and I agree that the term trigger is used way too frivolously today, but there might be legit reasons why a seemingly silly trigger is a trigger for another person.",
