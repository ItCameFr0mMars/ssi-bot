            "body": "I personally think it sounds like you're jealous and that's where your feelings are coming from. However, I can understand why you would also feel frustrated. A major plot point/idea you started with has not come to play to fruition (the marriage) and now said character has told you he needs a break (which translates in my rl language as he wants to go boink something else and is a low-key way to break up) and is now off in the woods sucking face with another character. \n\nI have no idea why your character is still in his palace if they are on a \"break\". You talk about they aren't the type to sit up holed up in the palace so why are they? Because their boyfriend said he needed \"space\"? Go back to your character's kingdom and do whatever the hell your character would do and have fun writing and interacting with the other players. \n\nIf there aren't any other characters to rp with start marketing for some new blood. \n\nIf your character would hang out to wait for him to come back despite her kingdom needing their queen... then I'd suggest finding something to distract yourself with oocly and write elsewhere for awhile. My prediction is this situation your character is in is going to get allot messier as both these characters are played for the King's attention.\n\nI'm admittedly biased because your group situation would drive me nuts. I don't mind drama in a story, but I don't do in group rp. To me this screams to be of someone purposefully causing drama for their own attention needs.\n\nI hope it works out for you. \u2665",

Because you see, Nova is a pacifist and a commoner, she fell in love with Augus genuinely because he is a good and calm logic guy, a forgiving person, but also a very warm one (or at least he was in the server we were before). As for now he's being just a whiny guy, not that I don't understand why but... He's just being depressed with all his char lately, se also attempted to suicide another character of his and if it wasn't for Nova, she would have surely died.\n\nCall Nova stupid, but she is unaware of what Augus he is getting flirted on by this woman, hell, she doesn't even know this person exists. She does not have any other place to be as she isn't a princess, nor a queen but just a traveler from a faraway land. Just a commoner that traveled to this place and fell in love with it's leader. That from is most of her rejections come from, she's a \"barbarian\". I am unsure if the marriage is in peril or it will eventually happen, but as for now I heavily doubt so as Augus' silence to Wolf's char advances is upsetting and suspicious.\n\nRight now she is in the palace watching over this character that was kind of mortally injured, speaking with other characters that pass by before she gets to go to a marriage of Augus' first wife son.\n\nIn the meanwhile I am so continuing my other stories where I finally have some fun and less toxic drama and I am also working on a backup plan in case the whole server goes into a mess.\n\nI have a quite good grasp of the situation, but I just can't think of words i could use to speak with this with Dog as OOC. We've been through so many things together abandon him due a ship feels sad but if it all comes to worst, I guess I'll have to set sail.",

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but all this seems like pretty standard stuff, not an attempt to offend you. I think maybe it would be good for you to actually take a break from the game to clear your head. Or at minimum I'd let Dog live his life and go interact with the other players.
