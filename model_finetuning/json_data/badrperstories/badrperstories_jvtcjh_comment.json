I sometimes have 3-5 rps going on at once, but that number of course depends on how many you believe you can do successfully. You don't have to stick to one at once! But if you do want to do multiple at a time, it's good to sort of judge how many you want to juggle. It actually isn't as hard as it seems, because different people post responses at different times and all, so usually you won't have to deal with them all at once and can break them up depending on who responded and who hasn't yet.",

            "body": "Essay incoming!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI always have at least 2.  I work from home doing 3d, so there's a lot of hurry-up-and wait with waiting on scripts or large sculpts to export or renders to run, etc.  I have more free time than most people.  Right now I'm at 5 partners, and let me explain how that happened.  My rp account is u/somewhatlessrelevant, no secret, but so that commenting on silly twitter posts or whatever doesn't push my rp-relevant stuff out of sight.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have one partner of two and a half years who is very slow, but always worth the wait - he is gming the best 40k RP I've ever done and his writing is absolutely delectable.  I have one partner of about two years who is a frequent, reliable poster.  We exchange at least a couple of posts every day, sometimes more, and the quality of his posts is very high.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe other three are all more recent and quite slow, less than one post per day and sometimes more like one per week.  I expect at least two and probably all three to either go to hiatus, ghost, or end things in the next one to three months.  I don't *want* that to happen, I never do, and all of these are great writers (I am unabashedly picky). But it is very common for people to bite off more than they can chew in terms of post size and rate and end up leaving because of that.  In an ideal world, a lot of good writers would like to engage a long term novella-style advanced rp with solid plotting, but in the real world, most people can't do that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo it is very typical for me to roleplay with the fast guy every day, the slow guy when he is available, and the other three off and on as they show up.  It makes for a distracting day if everyone posts at once, but that almost never happens.",

Not everyone is in that place. And most importantly, *not everyone has to be*. So what if everyone else has multiple roleplays? If you can only handle one at a time, then only do one at a time. I can't imagine that anyone would judge you for ensuring you're writing within your capabilities. If they do, well, fuck 'em.\n\nHow experienced are you as a play-by-post roleplayer? How many roleplays have you handled at one time before without getting overwhelmed or burned out? Are you in the same place emotionally and mentally as you were then, or are you currently facing fewer or more stressors that could impact your ability to write? Do you currently have the free time and the motivation to write more, or would you have to find it somewhere?\n\nStart with one and add on slowly. I would say maybe add a roleplay every two or three weeks? That way you know for sure that you're capable of keeping up with your current roleplays. You'll also know whether or not you have the desire and ability to take on another one, or if you've got your schedule full as-is.",
