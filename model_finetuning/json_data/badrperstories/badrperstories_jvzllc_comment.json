            "body": "I feel like there are tons of different factors for this, especially considering not everyone is the same. \n\nFor instance, for me, I like it when we vibe. That doesn't necessarily mean exchanging life stories and talking about what we have in common, but showing off your collection of model references or character ideas and getting excited for each other. I don't want it to just be one-sided fun, you know, the giddiness of waiting for a post is infectious and I want to be able to share that fun instead of dragging someone along who is only half into it.\n\nSomething that really gets me is a partner paying attention to a conversation. If we have already discussed details and then they are just blatantly ignored once the writing starts, it really kills me. Just be up front with what you're looking for, and ask that others do the same I suppose. I don't know if any of that helps, but I do hope you find some good people. There are some gems left in the field, it just takes time sorting through the rocks.",

            "body": "So, I can relate here.  For the longest time, I roleplayed with one person.  We are talking almost 10 years on a daily basis unless one of us was away. Obviously, i was really used to our kind of roleplay and felt extremely lost when it very abruptly stopped.\n\nSo what i did in the beginning, when i returned to roleplaying in 1x1 settings after a short hiatus, was to go with other people's idea as long as they sounded interesting.  I didn't even know what to post to get the kind of rp i was craving.  So i did a lot of short stories, i learned what i really didn't like, tried many different style of rp (genre, 3rd person, 1st person, etc).  There was a lot of abandoned stories along the way, by me or the other party, and a few slightly awkward discussion of \"Sorry, we don't mesh well\".\n\n I look for pretty much the same thing as the previous commenters now in a partner : pay attention to what is said, remember that you need to be two to do that story and that both have to have a good time doing it, be open to their opinions on what is happening, participate in the creation process, and if it doesn't work out, don't fret it, be honest and keep looking.",

            "body": "To start, really think about what you like in a roleplay. What makes it exciting and fun for you? Is it long, casual posting with tons of details about the characters and the world? Is it short and quick back and forths? \n\nThis doesn't have to be exact, it can just be vague categories of things. Don't be afraid to explore different rps either, to find out where your sweet spot is. \n\nDo you want adventure, romance, slice-of-life, political maneuverings or a combination of all of the above? The biggest factor in being a good roleplay partner is finding people whose jam is your jam and you can't find that until you know what it is. \n\nOnce you have ideas of what you like or what you want to explore, it's time to find out how flexible you are in that how far outside your RP sweet spot you can go before it just isn't fun for you. This will enable you to offer compromises and alternatives because there are very few perfect fits in style, genre, subject matter, character preferences, etc. Be open to the other players' input and their preferences but not so open it ceases to be a fun pastime for you and turns into a chore.  \n\n\nSo, you know yourself, you know what types of player you're looking for, the key to being a good RP partner is being able to communicate. Don't be afraid of conflict OOC if something isn't working. Most good partners would much rather know so they can talk it out and adjust than for someone to just lose interest or ghost. If it isn't fixable don't be afraid to let go and move on. If someone freaks out at you for wanting clear communication, then guess what, you dodged a bullet on having a story to share in here.  \n\n\nSo, basically be aware of your needs, be conscious and receptive to theirs and don't be afraid to communicate. That would be my list.",

            "body": "TL;DR because this got obnoxiously long - people are varied enough that your best bet is to make your wants and limits clear from the start, as well as getting your writing reviewed, engaging in community aspects of roleplay through forums or servers, and trying writing exercises to better your writing.\n\nOkay, so. People are *wildly* varied. Everyone wants different things. That's just how life works. I'd say the best way to start getting better results with writing partners is to list, up front, what you must have in a roleplay and what you refuse to do. You only write in third person, you won't write smut, etc, etc. This will tell you what a handful of individuals want, but we can't exactly speak for everybody. You also may get better results from asking in a sub that's for general roleplay discussion rather than venting about bad roleplayers. \n\nI'd suggest finding somewhere that you can get your writing reviewed by roleplayers. Not only for spelling and grammar, but, for roleplay faux pas as well - if you've been writing with just one person for a long time and gotten comfortable with them, you might unconsciously be godmodding or metagaming or making other mistakes because your previous partner was okay with it. \n\nI also think it might help if you got into some community aspects of roleplay, whether that's resource forums or search hubs on Discord. That will definitely help with the 'meeting new people' part that you're looking for, plus, the forums I've seen generally have threads like 'peeves of the rp' and 'red flags of rp' which you can read through to see if there's anything you might be doing that turns people off. \n\nAnd it might be beneficial for you to look up writing exercises or prompt lists. Not for roleplay, necessarily, but solo writing as well! The more you write, the more you'll improve, even if nobody else ever sees it. You could also google tips for better writing, or check at your local library (yours might be closed at the moment, so no physical copies, but I believe they're still doing ebooks?). \n\nSounds like all of your roleplays have ended soon after starting. That's... well, I'll be honest with you, that's not good. That indicates to me that there's some kind of problem with these roleplays and unfortunately the common denominator is you. I would go back and list out why each roleplay ended. Are a lot of people ghosting on you? Were you wanting something they weren't willing to do or the other way around? Do you have a laundry list of things you must have from your partner? Realizing why each one fell apart (or even making a guess at it) could very well help you do better next time. \n\nOkay, with that massive essay of un-looked for advice finished, I'll actually get around to answering your questions! Took me long enough to get here, right? \n\n**What do you generally look for in your potential partners?** What I put below for requirements, but also a few other things. I like partners who will talk with me and discuss 'character dev' things like songs our characters would like, or what their favourite childhood memory is, or what kind of pet they would get if they could get anything. I like the social aspect of roleplay, essentially, but at the same time, I don't want to post real life information about myself like selfies, where I live, my real name, etc. I also look for people who provide their own ideas instead of just replying to all my attempts at plotting with one-word answers (kind of like the \"yes, and-\" principle). If they write characters they're already experienced with that's a bonus for me too, since I find those characters tend to be more rounded and less prone to abrupt personality changes. \n\n**What are your requirements?** General writing quality; I'm not picky, but if I have to guess at someone's meaning and ask them for clarification on every single post, I'm just going to save myself the trouble and bow out. Flexibility with post times, because I've got a lot of other things going on in my life and I just don't want to deal with someone who constantly asks if I'm ghosting them because I don't post every day. Roleplay etiquette, just really basic stuff like no godmodding or powerplaying or godmodding. \n\n**What makes their writing exceptional?** It's hard for me to put my finger on the writing part besides some objective qualities (like spelling accuracy in a writing sample, for example). Some writing styles just resonate with me more and have me more invested. But I do quite appreciate a good simile or descriptive phrase or bit of introspection. Things that bring to mind a clear picture of what they mean, or that give me an idea of where the character's head is at. For example, \n\n&gt;The sea's waves roll on cool and impassive as the eyes of a god. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Many of the windows were now missing from the building's seventeen floors, and some of the concrete pillars on the ground floor were cracked from impact, giving it the gap-toothed and weathered appearance of an old man who'd been in too many fights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The bottle slipped from Mordecai's fingers to shatter on the cracked asphalt below. Glass shards flew in a dozen different directions, reflecting the light back in a myriad of colors. Kinda like diamonds, the sniper mused, except the broken pieces were all sharp edges and wasted potential that weren't worth a thing any more. \n\n**What makes them stand out?** They're active, engaged, and inventive. That's what really catches my eye with a potential writing partner. Active - they're replying to me fairly quickly and not once a month, and preferably discussing character dev in between posts. Engaged - maybe that's not quite the right word for it, but, they reference things in former posts (like what a character's wearing) or the setting's lore (like a character thinking about a local town's unique branch of government) that tell me they're paying attention to what we do together and wanting to create a detailed, in-depth story. Inventive - they're not a passive roleplay partner that just responds to what happened in my post, they add something of their own, further a conversation or do some worldbuilding or even both. \n\n**How can you tell you've found yourself a good partner?** When I'm excited to get posts from them. That's really what it comes down to. I look forward to seeing what they write next and what they give me helps me construct a (hopefully) equally as interesting post for them to read.",

            "body": "This probably isn't what you want to hear because you labeled it at 1x1 and maybe I sound like a broken record, but for this I would say you need a group game, even just a small one. You need to be able to expose yourself to multiple styles of writing so that you can see in real time what's working for other writers and how to adapt their styles to your writing. Playing just one on one is only showing you one person's style at a time, not to mention it's a lot of pressure on just two people to build the story. In a group game, you have a plot and staff guiding it so you can focus on building your own character's story and your own writing.   \n\n\nAs for your questions:  \n**What you think is a good role-play partner?**   \nGood communication. Open communication. I cannot stand when a partner rewrites a post of mine to say something else happened instead of what I wrote, it's super disrespectful. My character is mine, they don't have the right to take my character from me. If they don't like what I wrote, they can talk to me and we can discuss a potential edit we're both okay with. Similarly, we all get insecure about being ghosted, right? Communicating how long a post might take, why we're lagging, what's going on in our lives that might make writing difficult - it's all important. Leave the ego behind, my partner doesn't have to explain every last detail to me or justify having a life, but it is pretty common courtesy to check in with a quick \"I'm having trouble with my muse\" so the other person isn't let wondering what's going on. It's even better when the communication is open enough that the partners are willing to help each other get that muse back. Maybe the last post just doesn't sit with them, a lot of people just lose interest. A good writing partner is willing to discuss that before giving up, without being overbearing.   \n\n\n **What do you generally look for in your potential partners?**   \n  Honestly, I don't actively look for partners. We usually find each other in group games because there's way less pressure. Our characters find each other and we build. Every single time I've tried to just start a story with a random person based on an ad, I end up feeling pressured to play what they want and I don't have fun. I just don't even bother with 1x1 stories anymore because it's never been a good vibe for me.   \n\n\n **What are your requirements?**   \nI typically require a minimum of 2 paragraphs, but I prefer five. Ideally, my partner will match me, but I know writing comes from inspiration, which can be missing for so many reasons at any given time. I also prefer to write with people closer to my age, maybe a little older. I won't write with minors, for their protection as well as my own. 18+ is the minimum, but when it comes to stories that are focused on my character and one other, I need for my writing partner to be at least 28. The writing partner I've had for the last two years is 45. There's a certain level of maturity that comes with life experiences that just can't be forced or faked. As for activity, if I could magically get three post per day, I'd be in heaven, but we all have jobs so one post every day or every other day is my sweet spot. Too much longer and it's hard to get back into character, the play and overall story starts to feel choppy from all the stop and go.   \n\n\n **What makes them and their writing exceptional?**   \nMy partner is exceptional because whenever we have an issue in play, we talk about it. We have an entire channel on discord that's purely about each of our communication styles and how we explain ourselves so no one's feelings get hurt. When things are tough in a story, we have the trust and security of knowing the other won't just bail, we just need to talk about things a little more. His writing is exceptional because he's detail oriented in ways that I'm not. The things I think of similarly are things he misses. Our styles compliment each other really well. My style of writing has changed so much since we started writing together because he pulls so much inspiration out of me all the time. It's not something finite that I can hand you to tailor your own style, it comes down to chemistry when writing which you have to search for in the same way you need to search for a good romantic partner. RP and dating are not much different. You can set yourself up on the right platforms, advertise yourself and your stories as best as possible, bring a lot of great content to the table - but if there's no chemistry, it'll never work, even if you're not writing romances.   \n\n\n **What makes them stand out?**   \nHe stood out because he listened to my boundaries and never once tried to push them. He earned my trust and then my respect in this way. Most other partners left me feeling pressured to commit to sexual RP early on, they insisted my character had to show that they were attracted to the other character at the first meeting. He never did. Sometimes, our characters end up hating each other and there's no spark. We keep writing anyway because we trust that the story is still going to be great, and it is.   \n\n\n **How can you tell you've found yourself a good partner?**   \nIf you feel like you can talk to them about anything that's bothering you with the story, that's a good bet. If you find yourself nervously avoiding signing on to face them and having to explain that something isn't doing it for your muse, that's a bad partner. Or at the very least, that's a partner who isn't right for you. Trust your instincts. If your instincts are telling you that the moment you tell your partner something like \"hey, I'm not feeling this\" they're going to lash out or make you feel bad - it's not a good fit. It's RP, sure, but a writing-*partner* is still a partner. Open, full, transparent communication is the only way it works.   \n\n\nAgain though, because you said you're so set in your ways, I really think groups are your best bet. You need to be able to see multiple writers engaged, you need to be able to engage with them and be receptive to critiques in order to grow. Otherwise, you're swimming in the same waters with the same fish. You know the \"big fish, small pond\" analogy? Same concept. You can only grow so much at a time in these small stories.",

            "body": "I think you'll probably find that there is a consensus on what people want from an RP partner at an OOC level: someone who is communicative, at least somewhat active, won't ghost, isn't secretly using RP to try to find a girlfriend/boyfriend, isn't going to blur the lines of OOC/IC in other ways, etc.\n\nBut in terms of what people are looking for in the RP itself, that can differ hugely from person to person. Having a decent understanding of grammar and spelling is a plus, and so is having an ability to generate fresh ideas, but in terms of writing style, post length, subject matter, and all those other nitty gritty RP details, you will find that people's tastes vary wildly. So in that respect, it's a good idea to figure out what *you* like, and then look for other people who share your preferences.\n\nIf you're interested in honing your writing skills, there are websites out there that offer a lot of good advice. A google search or two should fix you up. And as always, one great way of improving your own writing is to read works by other well-regarded writers.",
