Well, one happens to be Norwegian and knew what group he meant. That's super convenient, right? Well, apparently the collective experience of the group that had numerous overseas members and those that had traveled and considered moving before who were only giving him fair warnings and advice on how to make his goal work, meant nothing. Even coming from the Norwegian who lived in Norway and spoke Norwegian and knew the trials associated with the group and how hard it would be if he didn't learn the things she told him, ranging from language basics to how to get a visa and that he'd need another job and place to live for a least a few months and not to expect to get in immediately because of various things.\n\nNo, it all boiled down to \"well, that's your opinion\" (which he didn't even spell opinion correctly at the time), which greatly angered the Norwegian in question whom then vowed to not answer a single question and revoked her offer to teach him the language because of how arrogant and rude he was being.\n\nWe decided then that if he wanted to prove us wrong, he was welcome to, but if he got himself stranded because he was too proud to listen and lower his expectations then we weren't at fault.\n\nHe didn't want to save money for a year, he wanted to leave within a few months after getting his diploma (after confessing he had no money for a long time because he didn't have a job, so it's not like he already had it in the first place) AND he wasn't even bringing his girlfriend Maw with him. He never factored her into his goal and was planning to ditch her here so he could go live his \"dream\".\n\nEventually, this goal fell through and he decided Australia was better about a month later, so if that tells you anything about him, there you go.",
