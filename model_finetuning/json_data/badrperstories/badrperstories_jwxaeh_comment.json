Honestly there are a thousand and one reasons why someone might end an rp. \n\nI personally dislike ghosting and even if it's going to be uncomfortable telling my partner why I am ending it, I send a message. \n\nThe only time I've just left was in instances of someone going off on me once because I wouldn't alter an OC and some cases of men sharing me images of their own dicks during rp. That's a hell nope. \n\nFar as rping with ghosters again, don't be a doormat. If someone were to ghost me, that's it. If they were a proven partner and had a reason they couldn't send a text that takes thirty seconds like a car crash or, I would consider it. New? No.  If these can't respect you as an individual to send a text then they are likely going to do it again. You're a human being and not a doormat. \n\nKeep growing as a person and a writer and you'll find someone who will walk the journey with you, Sometimes its a short walk and sometimes longer, just enjoy the journey. \u2665",

Maybe they are getting messaged by 20 other people who want to rp with them, and they only have the time and mental energy to rp with one of them, meaning that unless you are their number one favourite you'll be benched and forgotten, without any message or explanation because, again, that would take time or mental energy, especially if you were to react badly.\n\nIf every person you try to rp with has 19 other people who want to play with them, then on average you'll get a partner out of every 20 people you hit up.\n\nAlso factor the people who only rp once or twice a month, and don't feel the motivation to play after that.\n\nAnd also factor people who don't even want to rp, and just put up rp requests to get the rush of positive feelings from having people come up to them asking if they can play, who are just there to take the cookie and run.\n\nThis all to say: getting ghosted does not mean there is a problem with you. Just a couple hours ago me and a friend were chatting about how flakey most partners are. The only issue I see with your writing here is that it could be broken up into paragraphs.\n\n&gt;I work out a big elaborate plot, spending hours of my time, and we get a few messages in before the person vanishes.\n\nGifting that much time and effort to a stranger who could vanish out of your life just as easily as they entered, with no visible signs of remorse nor empathy, is a pretty bad deal.",

I recently had to end a writing stint with an absolutely amazing writer because he was bringing in a ton of multiple characters and I was just...really, really overwhelmed.\n\nI told him I usually do 1v1 with OC\u2019s with the main focus being the two charas played, but I can tell that he really, really enjoys having multiple characters.\n\nNow that more work has come up for me IRL, it became clear I couldn\u2019t balance both if I wanted to give him the story he deserved. I don\u2019t want to take away the joy of multiple characters from him\u2014 he\u2019s so talented and I feel it would detract from his enjoyment. I just can\u2019t keep up.",
