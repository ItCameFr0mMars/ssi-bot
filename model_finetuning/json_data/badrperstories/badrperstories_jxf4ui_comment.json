It's like smacking a dog for doing something correctly and getting confused when the dog stops doing the right thing.  \n\n\n(That's in the context of the story tho.)   \n\n\nI'm trying to say that, I don't really think you're the one in the wrong since the reaction in the RP isn't really helping your character, it's okay for the characters to be upset at him but spitting in his face isn't gonna help. ~~Or I'm just really petty because of my years playing villains.~~",

Because, well, you've explained that part pretty well yourself. That being said, I do think you can manage to salvage this situation if you put work into it. I do think it's a bit strange, though, that your partner set the scene for your character to redeem himself by... having the majority of her characters write an essay about how he can't be saved and they never want to see him again? \n\nFirst things first, though, would your character put in the effort to make the others think better of him, or would he just go ahead and fuck off like they told him to? And if the latter, where does that leave the roleplay? I think you may be doubling, based on you saying that your partner plays multiple characters, so maybe 'retire' this jackass character for a little while and say he went off trying to do things to try to turn himself around. Honestly your partner might need a break from his shenanigans. \n\nAs for redeeming, I think that would depend on what he's done, and what kind of consequences there's been in character. Was he playing pranks that went awry? Was he indiscriminately murdering people in cold blood? What kind of consequences has he faced in the setting for his behaviour, or what consequences would he face if he were caught? Has he tried to make amends or doubled down on defending himself? If your character falls toward the 'unapologetic war criminal' end of the jackass scale, well, it might be better to let him go, at least temporarily.",

I'd have another chat with your partner and ask if she's really okay with writing with this character. Sounds like she's not if all that's happening but might have said she was to not hurt your feelings. It'd be completely fair for her to mention that the characters he's hurt think he's bullshitting, but actively writing out all their grievances is a step beyond that. I agree that retiring him for a bit is probably a good idea, you can focus on more agreeable characters in the meantime and hopefully that'll give you both some space from the character to end up making the decision that's best for you both.",

            "body": "It sounds like you've written yourself into a bit of hole and your character has done enough damage that a change in behavior alone isn't going to convince the characters he's hurt that he has truly become a better person.\n\nThing is, in real life, assholes don't learn or change very often. I mean yes, it does happen, but to set off that kind of growth, there usually needs to be some sort of catalyst. Because self-absorbed people (and most immature jackasses are, to some degree, self-absorbed) don't just suddenly start putting other people first. So you need to figure out what his catalyst for change is, and it needs to be convincing. That usually takes a lot of time, build-up, and a pretty thorough understanding of human nature to pull off.\n\nAnd then, even if you \\*do\\* pull it off and manage to redeem your character convincingly, it doesn't mean that the other characters have to forgive him. In real life, even when a former abuser grows and changes into a better person, the people they've abused are under no obligation to welcome them back into their lives. That holds true in RP too. Those other RPers probably want to stay true to their characters' experiences and personalities. They might feel that it would be completely unrealistic for their characters to forgive yours at this point. And if so, that's something you need to accept. You don't get a say in how other people play their characters.\n\nTLDR: You've either got a long road ahead of you to redeem your character, or you could take the path of least resistance and create a new one. Because even though the damage your character has done was (hopefully) all IC, that doesn't necessarily mean it can be fixed. Realism might dictate that your character doesn't get a second chance with everyone they've hurt.",

It'll also give him practice doing things for non-selfish reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe needs reasons for being okay with expressing genuine emotion. Often when people act cold, it's because they're afraid of vulnerability, afraid of being judged, afraid of rejection, etc. So... he'll need to either discover that at least one or more people are willing to be friends with him even if he does express emotion... or he'll need to realize that it's worth the risks of rejection and judgement in order to genuinely connect with people.  \n\n\nI suggest either writing events for this character on your own, or finding someone (other than your regular partner) to help you write them if you're unable to do this by yourself.

But that's the fun part, y'all can take it slow and slowly add awkward but nice bonding moments. \n\nI totally agree that maybe he should retreat for a bit and *then* come back. Have his need for redemption come from a place of introspection and moral conviction, not just the desire to please the people he's wronged. He should be determined to do the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing. That is, if you're not doing this already.",
