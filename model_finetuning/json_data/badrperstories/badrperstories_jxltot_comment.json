Stereotypical 'I'm too cool for school and I'm stubborn'...\n\nBonus points: said people often want a romance RP (which is my favorite RP genre) but... Their characters... Are the blandest, most common 'I just started making OCs' I have ever seen. It's draining to try to tell them 'no, please pick another personality, or tone down the powers, or both, your character is clearly underdeveloped and I don't want to RP with the OC if you can't put forth more than a reference image/personality that's very, very difficult to RP romance with'. Even better if their OC is stubborn and hateful even to their love interest- and I'm not warned in advance.\n\nI just... Ahg. I want my fandom romance RPs, but I almost always run into these kinds of folks.

The type that just wants smut. I RP canons, some which are popular characters within their fandom, and I tend to attract people that only want to RP because they're attracted to the character and want to ship. They message me asking about RP/shipping, then stop responding and unfollow me when they find out I don't insta-ship with people.\n\n3. The ones that blatantly don't read rules.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good romance even though I usually don't like it as the main event. The problem is the pacing and how my character's are only allowed to respond to the romance a certain way. There's very little time before they're meant to be all lovey dovey and if I want something slower paced, I get my partner whining at me OOC. It's supposed to be a smooth sailing romance where even my most awkward of OC's must be suave and alright with sickly sweet words and a bunch of kissy face.\n\nThe latter is just frustrating because these RP'ers come to their own conclusions about my OC's and just don't tell me what they're thinking and gets annoyed when I don't play them like they want. Abrasive women are just feisty, even a single flirt with more than one character means they're head over heels or loose, garbage men are obvs gonna be a redemption arced, and recently I had a gay man who just so happened to be kind and immediately got an uwu soft boy treatment which was just...real uncomfortable.",

I know I'm prone to clearing my notifications when I'm busy and then completely forgetting I had messages only to go back a day or two later and see them there.\n\nThen, often times these days, I just... Don't have the energy to reply. I don't want to leave it hanging but I can't muster the feeling to type back and re-engage.

If you find yourself crying every RP, consider the possibility that the dynamic might be toxic, or you\u2019re touching on your triggers. A good cry every once in a while is ok! It means you\u2019re into it!\n\n2. You spend too much time focusing on the other character. OR, you focus only on your character. Sometimes it\u2019s normal for spotlights to shift but if it\u2019s the whole RP you might need to consider some things.\n\n3. Overly descriptive. Are they going far too detailed into a character\u2019s description (especially of their body, and you didn\u2019t ask for a lewd roleplay) or maybe they\u2019re very descriptive at describing injuries, going into graphic detail? Might be a tip off.",
