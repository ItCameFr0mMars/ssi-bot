I dropped a canon character because I got sick of it.\n\nI RP canon characters and this is something that definitely happens. There can be many reasons for it, but I think a big one is that often certain ideas/headcanons for characters will become popular within fandoms, and it's possible you're getting people that are expecting you to follow \"fanon\" instead of canon. Or, those people have their own personal headcanons involving the character you're writing, and are expecting you to follow *their* interpretation of the character instead of your own. Both are equally frustrating.\n\nsharkteethies' idea of looking back on your writing for consistency isn't bad either, though, both for OCs and canon characters.",

I think the new online generation maybe affected by the lack of discipline younger kids are receiving and it's leaking into their online presence, ya know? Those kids we've seen that cry in stores, hit their parents and never get grounded have grown up and now they're branching out for the first time only to realize the anonymous world of online interaction means they probably won't get their way and their lack of social skills is playing against them, especially if they encounter older people who've already grown past that phase, yet they become exceedingly vocal about it because tantrums always worked at home so they should work here too, apparently.\n\nThen they look stupid and make up things to seem better and it's a whole ordeal just because they didn't get their way and no one is kissing their ass",
