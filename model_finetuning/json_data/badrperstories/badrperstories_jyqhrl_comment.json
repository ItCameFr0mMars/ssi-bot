Just basically stuck it in! I'd always assumed the whole point of ERP was to be, well, erotic, and to write something appealing/sexy, but this guy just felt like a dud. I seem to have much better luck playing out intricate storylines that also happen to involve sex, rather than just sex-focused roleplay. Of course, I haven't really ventured into strictly ERP since then, so maybe it was just the (bad) luck of the draw!",

And umm, to put a long story short, my character being the submissive that she was, went along with whatever her partner wanted, and only now do I realise that it was p r**pey. \n\nAlso, found out from my admin friends that the writer of my character's partner was basically just being an OOC piece of garbage and basically self inserting into these erotic posts. So that was gross. \n\nAlso, I think the worst parts about writing erotica with a partner is not communicating, so the whole thread just seems weird and disjointed and just awkward for everybody involved lol",

They get frustrated without an easy win and it let's me weed them out most of the time. \n\nOne of my -hates- is mind control, especially in ERP. It's used as another short cut like an easy way out to get smut. I had one guy kidnap a girl and then tried to fuck her. She refused so his way around that was to mind control her with \"special powers\" that is dick tasted like chocolate to somehow convince her to suddenly give him a willing blow job. I was so flabbergasted by that move I had her hate the taste of chocolate and bite him. He promptly got a message that this isn't working out and I wished him well. Ever since then I always say no mind control in my advertisements.",

            "body": "I'd probably have like, a whole ton of these stories if I were to dig deeply enough- but here's one that comes right off the top of my head-   \n\n\nThis guy I used to rp with was literally the worst. Basically, I do not really enjoy ERPs usually, there's special occasions I'd say I'd do them and usually those are only if the plot is really good (and the story is mostly based on the plot and not the sex), or if I'm doing it with really close friends who I'm more comfortable around. I'm not the best at writing sex scenes- I'd say I could do it, but I'm not a god at it- so I try to stay away from it usually  \n\n\nBut this guy- this guy wanted to rp smut with me, but he didn't really tell me he did until after we started the rp and it was obvious. We did a pretty decent yet simple plot where my character had just lost his previous partner and has to take care of their daughter himself, but turns to his character, an ex he trusts, for help and there was a chance of a romance sparking between our two characters. **He suggested this idea to me, it was not my idea.** That comes into play a bit later. I just liked the idea so I went with it.  \n\n\nI guess this guy, yeah, wanted to have sex with my character and only have sex with my character. The first night the two characters were together again his character would basically shoo off my characters daughter and convince him to have sex with him. I really wasn't like- looking for an ERP, so of course, I was kinda shocked he wanted to do one- but at the same time, I was a people pleaser back then and did it even though I kinda didn't really want to. It was kind out of character for my own character, and even himself was a little hesitant in the rp, but somehow this guys character convinced him otherwise.  \n\n\nThe sex scene itself was... boring and disgusting, I'd say. I won't go into details but it was the poorly written sort of \"He got hard and fucked his lil boy pussy\", one line kind of thing. The way he described things was kinda gross too, I wish I had specific messages but I had to block him because he low-key started harassing me at some point, so I have none of the exact words he used. It was just... very uncomfortable. I also sort of thought hopefully it would be a one time thing.  \n\n\nBut it wasn't.  \n\n\nThis guys character I guess was a little, or into DDLB, which of course- is fine- I don't mind that at all, but for me? I personally don't enjoy that. I get people doing it as comfort in a way, sure, but when it turns sexual I find it really weird... and of course, my character had his own daughter, so he felt a little weirded out with the situation as well because he did not like the idea of having sex with someone who was trying to act as if they were a child around 6 years old- or even younger- he has a lot of trauma relating to sexual abuse as a child, and he clearly expressed he wasn't really that into it or comfortable with it, said it was fine his character was though, it just wasn't for him and he'd really like it if he didn't call him \"daddy\" or acted like a literal baby if they were to do anything. His character of course, instead of respecting my characters feelings, got mad and upset about it and used the \"buT It'S A cOmForT thInG\", which made my character of course feel bad, and give in though he was uncomfortable. He didn't want to make his partner feel bad, of course- even though his partner wasn't really making him feel great either. But whenever my character stood up for himself, this guy's character would throw a fit.  \n\n\nAnyways, this guy wanted to have sex at every single moment in the rp. In the morning? sex. At lunch? sex. At night? Sex. And that's ALL he ever wanted. My character would try to do stuff, such as work to make money (I don't think *his* character had a job, but his character expected mine to work and make the money and be the \"man of the house\"), take care of his daughter, literally breathe- no- his character would tell him to \"take off work\", or shoo his daughter away and keep her in her room all day so they could bang anywhere and everywhere. And my character would try to say no again, he's human, he isn't a sex machine- sometimes this guy would back off, other times he'd once again, throw a tantrum to make my character feel bad. It was always what this guy's character wanted.  \n\n\nAnd I'd try my best to focus on other parts of the rp- my characters life, my characters struggles, my characters good and bad days- my character's days at work and the time he'd spend with his family and his daughter. But this guy would try to get in the way of literally every single moment my character would have. Either 1) turn it into a dry and boring sex scene or 2) turn it around to make it about his character. There were times where my character would have a bad day at work and come home to want to either sleep or just relax himself because he wouldn't feel so good- or he'd want to spend time with his own daughter because he wouldn't see her all day. This guy wouldn't allow it- once again, he'd either try to fuck my oc or do this- he would have his character injure himself in the dumbest possible ways, but have to be sent to the hospital- and have to be babied and taken care of- all the time. Literally, that character lived at the hospital- and my character would have to deal with him. My character would get into a fight with his character about him not letting him do anything he wanted to- and his character would get \"depressed\" and purposely get into a car accident to get purposely injured, or get the attention from my character. Of course, my character would try to help out as much as he could- but there's only so much he can take, and this happened literally all the time. My character was miserable- but no- this guy had to make his character even ***MORE*** miserable.  \n\n\nAnd the rp wasn't the only bad part- this guy would send me ooc messages too. He would send me porn gifs ooc, would criticize everything I do, tell me he's horny and needed to rp a sex scene, tell me my writing and art sucked (he literally wrote 1-2 lines, I wrote at minimum a paragraph- though I can write so much more, but when i did, he'd message me and say \"that's too much I refuse to read it\". Also, my art would be significantly better than his, too- I thought i sucked then, and have improved since. and I don't want to be mean to him, but dude, you could tell just by looking at it- and he thought he was the shit, which made it worst), insult me in general, etc. Even later on he got mad at me for, I don't even know, focusing too much on the RP PLOT ITSELF? Like literally, he got mad at me because I wouldn't \"pay enough attention\" to his character, even though my character couldn't take care of his own damn daughter because the man took all his time away from him to have sex with him or cry about him. And then he'd get mad at me about there even being a daughter in the first place- **THE RP WAS HIS IDEA-** it was ridiculous. \n\n  \nAlso, this guy told me that he hated how my characters were \"too mentally ill\", even though literally the only mental health struggles my character had was depression and PTSD. His character literally had the same, except it was poorly researched and even more poorly written- but only HIS character was allowed to be that way. He told me he didn't like how MY oc had a traumatic past- however, HIS could- HIS character was allowed to have abuse in his backstory, but once again, have it poorly written/researched, it was just there for people's characters to feel bad for his. I make sure to research everything I do- accurately portray it- but this guy didn't like the truth. The truth I guess wasn't \"sexy\" enough for him.  \n\n\nI eventually had to block him because I was done with him- and the only reason why I stuck around as long as I did was because I was friends with the dude's boyfriend as well, who was and still is a pretty nice person, I have no issues with him. But later on we talked more ourselves and realized this guy was not only a shit rper, but a bad person as well. So we both did out bests to cut him off. And it's been alright since then.  \n\n\nIn conclusion... I am more strict about ERPs these days, and I have gotten better at telling people no- I'm not so much of a people pleaser as I used to be. Sorry for the long story, I tend to only plan to write a little bit but there's so many details and they tend to be way longer than expected- but hell, this definitely was a crappy ERP story.",

But it all felt so.... one sided. My character was doing literally everything to make hers feel good and he got nothing in return. To illustrate my character kissed and caressed her all over. Teased her lovingly. Gave her oral. Made her climax. Didn't get touched at all by her in turn. When grabbing a condom to put on to ensure he wasn't gonna make her pregnant she was self absorbed and even if he just made her climax she started rubbing herself. It just felt like all that mattered was her pleasure and he was there to completely service her. Now, had we agreed to such a theme beforehand, sure. But we didn't. And it wasn't anywhere near femdom either. It was supposed to basically be sweet traditional sex. She was just... doing nothing but have stuff happen basically. It felt really selfish. And before anyone suggests she was actually secretly a guy, no. I've talked to her face to face and all. It was a girl. Just felt I had to add that because usually it's the guys with a bad rep in ERP. \n\nThe other is an issue I ran into when doing a MxM relationship where the other male character was played by a girl. Don't get me wrong. I think a lot of girls are great to RP with as any gender. The whole non-sex scenes were great in this RP btw. But when I got told they wanted to have a relationship where both characters are versa I don't expect for my character to always top and do all the work. As in literally do all the work which also entails no foreplay for my character,  just theirs. I really, really do not like pillow princesses. Look just cause one takes the D doesn't mean just laying there doing jack shit at all times. There was a scene as well where my character clearly felt like bottoming for a change. Did it happen? No. He wound up topping. Like girl please. Just say you wanted to play a bottom not a versa. There was nothing versa about her character.\n\nI actually have a third one which was with someone who was a virgin and that's fine. I mean there are plenty of things one does in RP they never experienced for real so I assumed it wasn't gonna be too much of an issue. But, they seemed to know just about nothing about sex as a whole. It made for very illogical stuff to happen. Funny in the end. But... yeah. Not good. LOL I mean when someone thinks balls is another word for the D I just can't.  Hahahaha. It is even plural!!!! I wish I was making this up. But no.",

            "body": "Oh boy, there are quite a few of these I have in my arsenal. I'll start by saying that most of them was with one and the same RP:er and I knew all of these people IRL, which just made some of them even worse to power through: \n\n* First one: Tablet top RP. The player in question plays what he describes as a \"charmer\". To be frank it was not so much the classic \"noir\" charmer but rather the \"the guy you think might spike a girls drink if she says no\" \"charmer\". The setting was building up: some paranormal investigation shissles. One of the NPC's gets under the spell of the bad guy and seems to have fainted. What does this wonderful \"charmer\" do? Take her to the hospital? Make sure she's safe? No, silly, he tries to grope her. Said player got horribly upset when he other players confronted him in character for what can be classified as the start of sexual assault. For weeks later said player was salty that the rest of us \"insinuated his character was a bad person\". It also completely flew over his head that I, as a DM, did not approve of any players trying to start \"erotic\" scenes at my table.\n \n* Second one: Back in the days of my teens I got introduced to a girl who liked to play m/m pairings. This was kind of what I liked to do as well and a such, we discussed possible scenarios. Most of the time it was simple slice of life or some grand adventure. After only a few sessions of writing she started to ask questions about \"shota\" roleplays. I shoot this down immediately, as I am no into that entire thing. She agreed, in hindsight, a tad too eagerly and like a fool, I thought that was the end of that. Oh how wrong I was. It only took a few days before one of her characters, who was I believe around 10, started to behave extremely inappropriate towards my character (a man in his 40's). There was no misunderstanding: the things her character said/did was not just \"childish\" fun, it was horribly sexually suggestive. I took the rp OOC and told her to cut it out, I was not into that thing and I would not continue roleplaying with her if she ever did that again. She whined, said she didn't \"mean it like that\", that I was being unfair, that she had depression. I think she pulled everything on me to guilt me into continue RP with her. Which, I did, like the good little people pleaser I was. Only about two weeks later: she tried to pull it again and, this time I just told her that was it. Blocked her. She whined to some common contacts that I was being unfair with her. \n\n* Third one: Honestly, this girl could be an entire thread in and on herself but I'll try to keep it brief. We played for several years together and I'm ashamed to say that I let her walk all over me during that time. She had a nasty habit of stacking trauma on her characters as if it was a tower of pancakes. The trauma was generally sexual in nature and, most of the time, would be brought up at every opportunity. Despite this sexual trauma however, her characters couldn't live without someone putting some D into them. I know that this is a cooping mechanism in some traumatic situations but it was more of a modus operandi than anything else. She would also refuse to play a top or even a verse. All ERP with her characters turned into the same stale, boring pump and grunt and comfort on repeat. It was like reading the same *granny porno* fic over and over. The times my characters where insinuating that they wanted to get some she would refuse and instead turn the situations so that mine had to top. When we spoke both IC and OOC and I made light of my characters boredom of the stale/samey sex scenario she would guilt trip me and say that her characters had \"gone through so much\" and that they were \"traumatised\". The same girl, as mentioned usually wanted to have \"sexual trauma\" as part of her character... This went places, or at least she tried to make it go places despite me being very firm on my \"no non-con\" policy. It is just my speculation but I think she got some sexual thrill out of it. Our RP's fizzled out and last I've heard she found a new partner that is more than eager to also drown in misery porn, so I suppose that it works out for them.",

            "body": "I mostly RP in erotic roleplay circles, so ironically that means I don't have many stories of bad ERP. Almost everyone I roleplay with has had a lot of experience with ERP, so they're used to the quirks that come with it, and are generally pretty good at it. People who are new to ERP aren't used to having their actions limited to just sexy actions, and don't know how they should act or how to describe it. Many of them have also not had much experience in the bedroom in real life, so have no real-life experiences on which they can base their actions.\n\nThere have been a few RPs I didn't enjoy, and they all came down to inexperience on my partner's end; for example, they'd ask me to pin them during the RP, so I do, and they'll have no idea what they should do now that they can't move and just moan a lot. They're into it, but they don't know what they're supposed to do and may be a little uncomfortable acting, as they worry they'd \"do it wrong.\" In cases like that, I tend to engage them OOC and make sure they're enjoying themselves, I don't want them feeling like they're not good enough just because they're inexperienced, and make it very clear that I'm here to help them feel good. I make sure they're enjoying the RP, and do my best to make them feel comfortable.\n\nThere have been a couple of times when experience had nothing to do with why the RP was bad, but those largely came down to clashes in ERP style. Usually it was because they were a \"bratty\" sub, someone who wants to be \"tamed\". They tend to like frustrating and/or denying their partners, pushing boundaries, and generally complicating the experience. Most bratty subs want you to frustrate, deny, and push them back; \"punishing\" them for being an uncooperative sub, often in the form of \"consensual non-consent.\" When I'm with them, I tend to need to set up a safeword really early even if we're not doing anything hardcore that would usually require it. When \"no\" doesn't always mean \"stop\" and could instead mean \"more\", even calm, relaxed, vanilla sex becomes stressful to roleplay. If they do that rarely then asking \"cnc?\" out of character to make sure I know what their \"no\" means works fine. But with really bratty subs who are constantly refusing everything with the expectation that you'll see through their lies and follow the path of most resistance to pleasure them? Yeah, safeword, otherwise those kinds of hardcore brats just stress me the hell out.",
