            "body": "What an awful experience. I feel so bad for you. Now it's always hard to draw conclusions based on merely one side of the story but, from what I know, it just seems to me they simply were bullying you. I understand the fear and caution you may have towards roleplaying again,  but I do hope you can eventually move on from it. Group RP can be great but it can also be a really toxic environment when dealing with people who team up and harass one specific person. It happens a lot. One on one RP has its own possible issues too but they're easier to manage in my experience because it's just one other person. With that said if there's but one bad apple in a group RP it's easier to deal with and still carry on the RP.  If your partner in a one on one RP is a bad apple this means the end of the RP with them. But, if you're apprehensive still, I feel that trying to start up some one on one RPs may be better to ease back into RPing and rebuild your own confidence with good experiences. Just bear in mind that it takes time to find someone you truly click with. Sometimes you get lucky but oftentimes you don't.",
