It might help to communicate that you're specifically looking for slow burn. I had a situation recently where there simply was no winning- they wanted me to play a shy guy, which I was happy to do, but their character was groping mine right after they met. Then when I made him a bit more outgoing and okay with this, they were upset he wasn't shy anymore. Just put me in a tight spot, and I told them as much and left. Their character was very aggressive and it's simply not my rp style either, so don't be ashamed to tell them this, that it's not what you're looking for.",

            "body": "I feel like I could have written this myself.  One thing I've learned through my own experiences and from reading other people's stories, is that ghosting is super common and at least half the times you've been ghosted have nothing to do with you at all, especially on reddit.   Now, I'm absolutely sure some people are ghosting for the reasons you think.  I'm also a take-romace-slow person with characters that will call others out for being jerks (though I like ones that are played well).  It goes exactly as you've described it.\n\nWhat I find helps is being \\*very\\* specific about what you want in your ad, even overly so.  Make sure that you specify slow burn romance that happens naturally and slowly over time.  Make it clear that you do not want to play with rude characters.\n\nAlso, when you're setting up a roleplay, ask questions. How do they see a romance progressing?  How would they handle your characters fighting?  Do they see their characters as an extension of themselves?  Anything you might think could be an issue, bring it up in a friendly manner.\n\nLastly, don't rp with someone you're not sure about.  Sometimes we meet people who seem good on paper, but something seems off.  Sometimes there's someone who you know isn't really what you want, but it's close so you try to make it work anyway.  Be discerning and trust your instincts.",

            "body": "So the first issue is likely someone just wanting to get off, I apologize for the bluntness. There is an abundance of rpers who are more interested in the equivalent of sexting rather than story. Keep in mind, I don't really mind that folks rp that way, different strokes for different folks but it isn't my cup of tea.\n\nThere are few things I've found help me to discourage them and  weed them out.\n\nYou have to be blunt and forward in your advertisement, like a 2x4 upside the head direct. You can't use flowery language or try to polite or vague. You need to state I like these percentages and I'm looking for a long delay until any shenanigans to start. Romance can translate to some foreplay and with many people doing a quick scan instead of a thorough read, it can be thought to be something more sexual. \n\nCheck their posting history. People really searching for rp often put up their own ads and it can be a great insight into what they are looking for and give you an idea of the type of person who is splitting to be a partner. \n\nSpend time talking to them before rping and ask questions. All them If they have concerns, what they are looking for.  If they push you to start immediately or their answers are meant to hurry, I see it as a red flag. Most story based rpers want to make sure they are compatible in my experience... they don't want to be ghosted or have a failed rp. Use this time to bluntly emphasise again you are looking for quite a bit of story before any smut or that your characters will not have sex until they really get to know their character. \n\nFor the second issue, state clearly what personality you want and that your would not be interested aggressive, overly negative characters with a chip on their shoulders. Or however you'd describe them. Then follow up with personality traits your characters prefer. Ask them when they contact you for a profile of the character they were thinking about or ask them to describe their personality for you. You can even say \"Hey what would your character likely do or how would they act of x scenario\". \n\nAnyways, I hope that helps you in some regard and leads to you finding a partner that is a great fit for you as you are for them! \u2665",

If your partner's character is behaving in a way that doesn't align with what you've said you're looking for, make sure you bring it up.
