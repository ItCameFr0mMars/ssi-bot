            "body": "I think rp as dating and not in a creepy sense! I mean like sometimes you look at their profile and you can easily see that you're incompatible. Sometimes you talk over coffee and don't click and other times it's a few dates in. \n\nI personally refuse to ghost. I hate telling a partner it isn't working for me because x, y and z but I think it's respect for a fellow human being to at least say goodbye and wish them well. The only time I feel would leave without a goodbye is if the issue is them going off on me for anything in an abusive manner. \n\nIt's frustrating to get ghosted. It would be much more useful to know why because if it is something you are doing whether spelling, grammar, god-moting, etc then you have an opportunity to change and improve. That being said, many times you are _not_ doing anything majorly wrong. Some people have the attention span of a goldfish and just drop the second they get bored. \n\nMake a list to make sure they don't come back and repeat the same thing (Discord has a lovely note system which I use to label some identifying things about the rp or why it didn't work. It helps me of they reach out again via another hub or change their profile name.)",
