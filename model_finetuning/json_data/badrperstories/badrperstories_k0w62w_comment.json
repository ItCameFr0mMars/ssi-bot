            "body": "I feel pretty much the same way. Out of all the RP partners I've had (dozens), only 1 of them has stuck around for longer than two weeks (now it's been months). I'm even asking myself why I should even bother to look for RP partners anymore if all that happens, in the end, is that most of them will ghost me somewhere along the lines.   \n\n\nI honestly try not to get upset with ghosters, I get that they have reasons. Maybe their life got super busy (it's happened to me and this hasn't been the nicest year for most people). Maybe they just didn't feel comfortable admitting that they wanted to back out (which I can understand, I have been in that situation before). But every time you look for a partner only to be met with someone who will most likely ghost you? Yeah, it's infuriating.   \n\n\nI'm more frustrated than outright angry with ghosters. It's downright infuriating to think that one moment they're so interested and then the next, they're not. Was it something I said? Was it my character? Was it the quality of my reply? Did something come up in their lives so they had to take a break from RPing in general? I don't know because they never told me. It hurts even more when it's someone you've roleplayed with for a bit and *then* they decide to ghost you.   \n\n\nAt this point I'm just thinking to stop posting ads looking for partners. It's a lot of effort for nothing. I may take up group RPing if I ever find a good group for it or I may respond to other people's ads. I know everyone goes \"ghosting sucks, we get it\" (which most of them do) but lately I've noticed it's happening at a much higher frequency, at least to me. And before I could just brush it off but after having people ghost you *after* you post your first reply or post your character sheet (if you do those things) always stings quite a bit.",

Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't, but it's nice because when it does work out, it's all reward with little work, instead of little reward with a whole bunch of work. \n\nIt's not for everyone, but that's how I've found all of my long-term roleplay partners, and I'm still in contact with most of them and have even become pretty close friends with them.\n\nPlus, you can leave group RPs once they get boring and it's not as difficult to write your character out of them as it is to write them out of a 1 x 1 RP.",
