            "body": "When it comes to presenting my characters, I apply the same reasoning as I do when I judge someone in real life - what's the most important thing about a person/character? To me, it's how they *think;* what their personality is like; their values, opinions on important subjects, beliefs and convictions. I think this is the most important bit of information about a character, because no matter the story and setting, people will still have a general idea of what to expect. I strive to convey such information as concisely as possible, my taget being 200-300 words as an upper limit. This is also what I put at the top of my bios, because I believe that time is precious and so I'd like people to be able to determine, as quickly as possible, whether my character would be a good match for theirs.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the \"regular old\" you described, I do that, too. I always include name, age, sex, sexual orientation, physical characteristics, very basic information on how they'd interact with people. I think there are definitely people who go overboard with this format, though. To me, and this is a *personal opinion*, it's unnecessary padding to include information such as zodiac signs, favorite *anything* (this alone bloats up such a list - colors, clothes, music, food, hobbies, etc. - and it defeats the purpose of it being there for the sake of *conciseness*), place of residence... you get the gist.\n\nWith biographical details, I deliberately keep it to the bare minimum. I only include information that'd cause a \"how?\" or \"why?\" question while reading through the rest of my character sheet. For example, one character I have is an ex-convict, which naturally begs the question why he got a prison sentence in the first place. Another is a butler, who \"specializes\" in running the household affairs of supernatural beings. Since he's a human and at a venerable age despite appearing younger, it's only natural to ask how in the heck he could pull it off. So all in all, I try to include details that either I think the reader would be curious to know about, or I feel are essential in order for the character to make sense in the first place.\n\nFinally (and also ironically), I'm against walls of text. People need to realize that just because a character is dear to *you*, what with being of your own creation and all, it's a) not really the case with people who haven't gotten the chance to know him/her through RP yet and, b) there's only so much information a roleplayer can absorb in a single sitting. There's a reason why tips for beginner authors begin with not overwhelming your reader with too much information to keep track of.",
