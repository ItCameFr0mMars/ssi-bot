By that, I mean I still adore my RP and partner but I also run through the scenario of them ghosting and me learning to accept that eventuality before it happens. If it doesn't, that's awesome but by mentally reminding myself that no story is forever, I have learned to lessen the sting. That said, I do think trying to objectively look at yoor partnership is helpful and it's often not something I dwell upon. But I do think it helps me not get too attached, as difficult as it is. A fine line to walk. Don't disengage and resent someone for something they haven't done but don't put all your happiness or self-worth into the RP too. When I was younger anyway, a lot of my mood depended on my RPs progressing but I know each writer has different reasons for falling for RPs. Done rambling haha.",
