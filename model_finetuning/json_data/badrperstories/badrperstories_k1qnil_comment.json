            "body": "My staff and I have created a game out it, that I'm inclined to say really just comes with practice and experience, where we guess at the type of character we're about to see applied based on the questions they ask. At this point, it's almost creepy how accurate we are.   \n\n\nIf you don't already, make sure there's some sort of rule about consent to keep players from coming in and having their characters kill everyone else. Sure, you can remove them and delete all their posts, but that's a lot of time that you might not have. Dice also help to ensure that no one is ever OP unless they've earned the ability to be in play, but I get that not everyone likes or wants to use dice. You can get almost the same concept down with something like a coin flip bot or if players are allowed to be in multiple scenes with multiple characters at a time, you could tell them that every third attack on one of their characters needs to land as a blanket rule. This will keep the players who are geared toward chaos and destruction in check because they'll know that if they're running around with their characters getting into fights, they have a higher chance of being hit.   \n\n\nAs someone else mentioned, mind reading is usually a no. My server does have mind reading as an available ability *but* players need to roll dice for success and it eats a turn they could have otherwise spent defending. Time traveling is the big one for me. I don't allow time magic abilities in my server. It's way too OP, imo.   \n\n\nProbably the easiest way my staff and I can tell who a bad egg will be is if the questions they're asking are on the outskirts of the lore. Our lore is really extensive, there's a lot of ways to be unique while playing *inside* of the game. Players who come in asking for stuff that could technically be a thing but isn't touched on anywhere are a big light up sign for us that the player isn't actually their to write in a collaborated story - they just want to be the most unique concept in the game. The trouble with that is that we, as staff, then need to add in more lore that would otherwise not ever be played to just so that character gets to have their own story which never actually weaves into the plot. It's not even worth it for us because these players also tend to be very entitled and impatient, so when they're not automatically crowned king of the server and most popular, they leave and we'll have spent however long making room for an arc that never goes anywhere.   \n\n\nYou need to be comfortable with saying \"That is a really great concept, and I love your enthusiasm, but it doesn't actually fit into our plot anywhere and I need you to understand that you might struggle to find scenes for this character because it's not a concept this story was built to cater to.\" Be nice about it. Compliment their passion and creativity. But then also clearly express that the concept won't actually work and phrase it in a way that shows your just looking out for them and their potential enjoyment of the server.",

I don't wanna give a shitty reply to this helpful list you've given to me.)  \n\n\nWe do have some (thankful) rules in place to stop players from killing each other since in the RP, killing someone is a big event and it triggers another line of events that can shift the story. Dice is something we want but we are still working on ideas of what system to use since we want to keep it simple but make it work well for everyone, you are gotta get people who don't like dice at all. Dices are a great way to stop people always dodging and being OP.   \n\n\nWe are going on the base of a canon setting but we do have lore. You got a good point about how some bad eggs try to push their luck on what they will try to get away with. I've seen some real bullshit in my time.  It's kinda funny to bring up mindreading when in the setting the only way to get it does take some bullshitting but back to the point. I've seen people try to get really unique concept then use it in a way to become OP. Those kinds of folks are easy to spot the more you press them. (I hope so anyways.)  \n\n\nBeing nice about it would be the best move, the last thing you wanna do is make someone sour toward the server because of one person's actions. Thank you so much for all your tips, you listed a lot of things that I didn't even think of. Thank you a ton for taking your time with writing all this.",

It's likely all they will do is annoy the hell out of everyone because of how bland they are. If they're young or new, they may get a trial period where they have to be open to criticism or help if they aren't jiving with the group.\n\n\u2022Use of a mental disorder that has little to no impact on the character until it's convenient/disorders being used to hand wave bad behaviors, etc. If they want a disorder, then ask them to detail how it affects them and in what way and if it doesn't sound right or is done badly, deny it.\n\n\u2022Any character that tries to have traits or abilities that are outside the world rules and hesitate or argue about changing it because UwU snowflake. Create a system of double checking submissions where two admins have to say yes or the server owner has to say yes if they try to go above the heads of the admins because \"bias\".\n\n\u2022If there are further issues with the previous situation, offer to have an admin make a character that fits the server and tell them take it or leave it because they're on thin ice. If they want to show they're good with characters they can pilot a \"dummy\" to prove themselves and earn some brownie points in the server instead of being a headache. If they screw it up badly enough they get kicked anyway.\n\n\u2022Characters with no backstory or poorly written story. Sometimes mystery is fun but that right should be earned with trust; usually these kind turn out to be edge lords and such who want their excuses for being dicks. No backstory, no playtime. Bad writing can be fixed, but if they refuse to adhere to the writing policy (long form, shirt form, etc) that's another flag. Trolls and less serious players tend to abbreviate things, even in bios, so it's something to keep in mind though not a guarantee.\n\n\u2022Character submissions with uncomfortably sexual notes or information listed if the server isn't specifically catering to ERP. Usually this information exists because the character has been used for such things or is intended to so that may be an issue, though for younger players sometimes bust size and blood type are included due to anime influence. To be safe, though, I would recommend not having that information available in the server because it's not really relevant and likely to be referenced in roleplay along the same vein as r/MenWritingWomen so keep an eye out.\n\nThese are based on my own experiences in roleplay so take them with a grain of salt if desired.",
