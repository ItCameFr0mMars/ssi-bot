When something happens, I'm always the one expected to take control of them all, on top of my probably only two characters. I have this thing where I want to know what other people think about my children (characters) so I would like for them to react as well as me, since there's no reason for me to get out of it anyway.\n\nOne day I was doing an rp with my main partner when I needed her to take control of a nurse. She outright refused, I have no idea why. I stood my ground that day and told her if she didn't we would stop, and she got an attitude and half assed it. Then I really did stop because it pissed me off. There was no need to get pissy over something that small.",
