There can be multiple reasons that people avoid your character but seem to tolerate other rude characters, for example:\n\n\\-the other character is another 'brand' of rude. The dominant cool asshole type is often tolerated (at least when he is a man) because some people find that hot. I had some rps were I played annoying boys who weren't pretty, and they were universally hated, while my characters who were pretty boys did almost the same stuff and everyone loved them regardless.\n\n\\-is this a fandom roleplay? If you write a canon character, it could be possible that people don't like the character in general, which is why they seem to tolerate other rude characters but overreact when it comes to your character. It might also be possible that they disagree with your interpretation of how the characters would react and therefore avoid them. \n\n\\- Could it be possible that other people have another problem with your character that makes them despise this character (for example she is a bit of a Mary Sue or something like that, or you want to write every interaction with your character as the 'winner')?\n\n\\-are there already friend groups with have formed OOC and you are left out? It can sometimes be harder to find a connection to other people Ooc, do you thing this might be a problem? Some people prefer writing with their friends and ignore everyone else, unfortunately.",

People writing shy characters or characters who are pushovers and who would normally react with crying/being sad to bullying, but when you write them, suddenly the character turns into a superhero and beats your character/replies in a confident way and begins to bully your character lol\n\nMost of the time, this had nothing to do with whether this person likes you or dislikes you. It is just a power fantasy, they want to say/do the thinks that they could never say in real life to people or their want their character to be the 'cool' one. It is also possible that they were okay with the bullying at first, but then something your character said offended them and they overreacted (sometimes people see their character as a self-insert of themself, and when someone tells them that this character is ugly, they loose it). \n\n Have you seen how this person writes with other people (if they show other behavior that would make them a bad roleplayer), or did you have similiar interactions with more than one person in this rp?",

            "body": "How far are you taking the bullying in character? I have actually seen RPers use their asshole characters in order to make sexist or bigoted statements or use racial slurs because they could get away with it \"in character\". Other times, the bully character would hit just a little too close to home with their insults, e.g., telling a character to go kill themself while the RPer on the receiving end may actually have difficulty with suicidal ideation...\n\nI that sense, are you checking in with the RPers to ask if you need to take it down a notch? Are you aware of any potential triggers you may need to avoid? \n\nA lot of people think a bully character is an excuse to act however and say whatever they want without consequences, but in fact, it's the opposite. Playing a bully character requires a lot more responsibility in terms of knowing how far is too far and when to restrain depending on which RPer you're interacting with. \n\nOn a less serious note, sometimes it's just the nature of the character. People generally don't like a bratty snob. But as another commenter said, an asshole who is good looking and can also crack witty jokes can end up being a fast favorite. On the same token, no one likes a try-hard.\n\nI had an asshole character who was pretty hated, to the point that characters were lunging throwing knives at him just for entering a room. I thought it was hilarious, and my character just kept his cool. Over time, my character eventually toned his assholery down and he became a little more agreeable. Around then, other characters started to like him more, although he still kept his spicey attitude. \n\nIt takes a bit of balancing, but you have to feel your \"audience\" out (i.e., the other RPers) to get a sense of how much they are willing and not willing to tolerate.  Sometimes you do have to reel things in a bit.",
