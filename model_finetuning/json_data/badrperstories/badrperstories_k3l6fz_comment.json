            "body": "Hmm, I shall make a list:\n\n*Mr. Doom and Gloom* - That character that could or could not have a dark past, is mysterious, dark, grunts a lot, is unapproachable, sarcastic and pushes people away and he's always grumpy.\n\nIt's even worse if this character is supposed to be the love interest who despite him only grunting and any attempt at conversation failing, has a heart of gold once he lets you get close to him. In reality, nobody stands for such bullshit. Nobody has patience with Mr. Gloom. I'd just leave him alone and not approach him, if he acts like that\n\n\n*Little Miss Perfect* - Now, there are two variations on this character:\n\nA. The Iron Lady: She is perfect, she does everything right and everybody who disagrees with her is the villain. This lady doesn't need help from anyone and she wins at everything, any competition she enters. Sometimes with little or no preparation. You cannot win against her. She's all powerful.\n\nB. The perfect, but soft and delicate Princess UwW. She is so vulnerable, and always in need of saving.\n\n(bonus points if the characers have tragic pasts)\n\n\n\n*The character who has a tragic past and lots of trauma just for the angst of it* - This character's (can be any gender) sole purpose is to be a victim. They are given trauma just for the fun of it, so they would be so edgy and broken and sometimes, they are fighting also (poorly written) mental illness. Bonus points if they use said trauma and mental illness to get away with being a d*ck.\n\n\n\n*The self-insert* - Really, no explication needed here. Bonus point if the said insert is actually an idealised version of the writer\n\n\nI can't think of more now, but I think Mr. Doom and Goom, is safe to say, that he's my biggest pet peeve in a roleplay.",

            "body": "I mostly roleplay slice of life so I'll name a few character types I highly dislike.\n\nThe Basic Bitch - Yeah. She buys trendy clothes. Is a Tik Tok star. She goes to Starbucks. She thinks men give a shit about how much makeup she has on and doesn't go anywhere without it. She also wants to start a barista, a flower shop, or a bakery. She loves animals. Only if they're cute. She calls men she meets handsome just to get something in return. She thinks she's so beautiful and won't stop reminding you about it. Beyond basic. I've seen too many characters like this with flawless backgrounds that are very uninteresting and not realistic in the slightest.\n\n\"I hate myself\" archetype - Characters who are very shy, and their mental health becomes the center of the story's plot to the point your character doesn't matter. They will do anything for attention, including self-harm.\n\nThe Needy Mommy - A pregnant character who expects any man she goes out with to care for a baby that isn't theirs. Whether that is for attention seeking or the fact she got careless with birth control. Drama with the baby's father might be involved.\n\nThe Submissive Girl - And I'm talking about outside the bedroom as well. She depends on a man to get her going. I should've called this 50s housewife archetype instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like smol bean characters either.",

            "body": "Honestly 90% of what I avoid comes down to, \"Arsenic and mercury are about to hold an intervention for your character, and neither me nor my characters are dumb enough to get involved with them\". The other 10% is \"This character sounds like an excuse for you to be a nightmare partner\" or \"Please stop trying to pass off this damp paper towel as a character worth being invested in\".\n\nAny character with a highly aggressive or dominant personality is a hard no from me. I've never had a good experience with either. Why should my characters hang around a psychopathic murderhobo who threatens them, or around someone who acts like a tyrannical king/queen? That's not a good time in or out of character.\n\nTying into the above, a character who hates people, or avoids interacting with them. If your character is mister grumpy gills and acts like they would rather be stabbing themselves in the face than being around my character, mine is gonna bail  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  I have enough back problems, I'm not carrying a thread on my own for an indeterminate time.\n\nAnother personality type that I'll have nothing to do with is the dependent, for lack of a better word. If you expect my character to be parent *and* therapist *and* guardian *and* maid to yours, you're going to be quickly and severely disappointed. My characters have their own development and arcs going on, and they're not going to drop everything else in their lives to take care of someone else. Especially if our characters barely know each other.\n\nCharacters who can tank any and all obstacles. If your character can one-shot a literal deity and has their own personal army of thousands, fuck all the way off. And I mean, seriously, has anyone seen a writer with an OP character who hasn't godmodded every single aspect of every single thread they were in?\n\nAngst porn characters. Everything possible has gone wrong for them and their tragic past and secrets have left them a completely and irrevocably broken person. Until their love interest comes along and fixes them, anyway, nine times out of ten. What's the tenth time? Oh, more angst porn until they're kicked from the group or I end the roleplay.\n\nPerfect characters. Zero flaws, zero faults, zero weaknesses. And more often than not, zero personality. That's not a character sheet, that's just a sheet.\n\nI also won't get into any kind of 'fuck or die' aspect like A/B/O or heat cycles. I love both ideas, honestly, and I'd love to play with it and get into worldbuilding and how it affects characters. But I've run into too many people who try to use that as a cover for some real rapey bullshit. Or they want to write out extensive sexual content despite me saying up front that I don't ERP and prefer fade-to-black, which is a problematic player rather than character, but hated all the same.",

These are the people who try to make a character where they're fetishizing a disability or mental health disorder, usually without having done any research for the disability and turning their character into an honestly offensive stereotype. They have to be the most unique character in the story while also conveniently being freakishly intelligent, fluent in a dozen languages, automatically Valedictorian of their class, perfect in every conceivable way except for their disability which they will now lean on only when it's convenient in play and use as a character trait as well as as an excuse to meta game out of scenes that don't automatically go their way. And when, inevitably, people realize what they're doing so they stop engaging in play with the character, the player immediately wants to change the entire backstory to make their character popular. After they reroll, the same issues come up because the character is *too* unique, to the point that they don't even fit the plot, they leave - having wasted hours of my staff's time making this character work with our lore.",

Plus, I just hate the idea that positive=innocent baby. It's not a surefire sign of being sheltered darn it! ~~Is it obvious I'm tired of my positive OC's being treated like children?~~\n\nThe 'Adopt me!' type is weird and one I see in my apocalypses RP's more often than I'd wish. Found family can be nice but this underaged OC can and will latch onto any OC they come into contact with by acting pitiful. They want a parent and they don't care which character it is. They want the family dreamlife no matter the setting or what anyone else wants.\n\nMx. Innuendo is annoying to. No depth only flirt at first sight. Plot? Nah, we're going to go kiss/have adult content however many times we want! They are the Romantic Terminator and they'll hunt down their targets at all costs.\n\nHyper competent 'honest' genius. Truly, I just dislike how honesty equates to \"I'll say whatever rude stuff that comes to mind via my OC and shrug it off because lol they're just honest!\" When they completely ignore any positive things they're character's might blurt out. Nah, that OC is just a jerk hiding behind the 'honest' label and that just really annoys me.\n\nGay comic relief. Thankfully not one I encounter a lot but still, *really?* Sky's the limit with an OC and this player goes for the stereotypical tropes. Their only purpose is to lighten up a scene. They've got no depth beyond their appreciation for the same gender. Sometimes they're not even funny, we're just supposed to laugh at them.",

If they do get hurt it's tiny, doesn't inconvenience them, and may leave a cool scar.\n\n*Dice Roll:* Who will this character be today? You'll never be able to predict it, and picking up an unfinished scene with their player will mean a sudden ninety-degree turn into whatever this unpredictable, inconsistent character is today. \n\n*So Hawt:* Every outfit is sexy. Every character they engage with is a potential partner. You can't have your character say hello to this character without them twirling their hair around a finger or hiking up their skirt. It's weird. It's awkward. It happens without explanation and in the weirdest situations. Hunting down vampires? Hawt. In line at the supermarket? Hawt. Taking over the world? Hawwwwwt. Never. EVER. Invite this character to your character's Halloween party.\n\n*The Rooly Bad Austrayan:* What is it about Australian characters that bring out the worst in writers? Sure, there are other versions of this (everybody with an English character who says, 'allo guvnor' for example) but something about playing Australians just amplifies this to terrible, Irwinesque proportions. This character will tell you that it never gets cold in 'Straya, is perplexed by modern conveniences, and speaks from some Urban Dictionary nightmare of slang that nobody uses. With their accent written out.\n\n*Outdo You Too:* The character that has clearly been brought in as a superior clone of another character in play. They'll have the same obscure job or interest, maybe a similar name, and will often date the IC-ex, if there is one, or angle to date the IC-current partner of this character. They don't really have a personality of their own, but you can be damned sure that anything the original can do, this one can do it better, and \\~edgier in the same way adding a coloured clip-in hair extension in CW shows predicts a heel turn.",

When there's an established universe yet they seem to refuse to follow any of the lore or rules of that universe, and might even ignore other characters' preexisting reputations within the story. I see this most often when OCs are being inserted into canon but I'm sure it happens with original worlds, too.\n\n3. \"Everyone must love me.\" Expects every character to love or otherwise be friends with them. Doesn't matter if your character is the hero, the murderous villain that cares for no one, or the moody guy that never opens up to people. This character demands to be the exception, to be special to your character without putting any work into earning that kind of relationship.

There are never any consequences for their actions.\n\n\\-the 'so naive that it hurts how stupid there are' types. Don't get me wrong, sometimes, I love naive characters. But these characters are so stupid that they don't act like adults at all, more like six year olds. But not even six year olds are so inexperienced. Other characters can literally say 'I am going to kill you' while pointing a knife at them and they would be like 'teehee this is such a funny game, I am so naive and innocent'.\n\n\\-the 'savior'. This character will do everything to 'save' your character from the evil path they are on, no matter if they like it or not. If your character insults them, it is actually okay, because they know your character just had a rough childhood. They kill other people? It is fine, because your writing partner will make up some bullshit reasons why these people were actually murderers and so your character was justified in doing so. Bonus points if: They get angry Ooc every time your character does not take their moral speeches to heart OR their character is only interested in them because they are pretty and they these characters to fall in love.",

But i am always immediatly irked by how people play cat-girls, its always this cutsey \"uWu\" nyan stuff and it grinds my gears. the worst part is they don't even try to play into the cat part with any kind of intelligence, no funny cat puns or play on words. just \"Nyan\" and i think i've dropped so many people so fast because of how common it is -- (fox, wolf, and bunny girls are better anyway)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe \"Can't do anything wrong\" type: these people just aren't fun to play with or be around because they will often times be huge dicks, but becuase they're so cute and innocent they try and justify it. they always seem to be part of some clique too if its an RP server, either by being just in a \"group\" or by being the popular girl on the server. So the second you call them out or do something they dislike you have like 4+ other people hounding you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe god character: god like characters can be fun to RP with if its done right (it usually isn't by random people at least) i don't think i need to really elaborate more on this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe inflexible character someone already mentioned this so i'll copy their bit since it echo's my opinion **(Thanks** **Solgatiger****):** Inflexible as in their personality  doesn\u2019t change as the story progresses (I.e. a gruff and grumpy  character eventually softening up, a happy character turning cold due to  bad goings on, etc), they refuse to compromise in anything (their  logic, even if it cannot apply without changing the whole rp, had to be  there) and they expect your character to change completely to suit their  needs.\n\nIf their character has  gone through a recent trauma, every interaction is just about that  trauma. There\u2019s no eventually toughening it out for a little bit so  actual story progression can happen, they just expect your character to  comfort them every second of the day.\n\nThey ignore your characters because they\u2019re not doing something that interests the player rather than the character.\n\nThey\u2019re  always super op but somehow a weak and constantly thinking of homocide  character. They also always have to win a fight against creatures  they\u2019ve never actually come across because they\u2019re \u201cJack of all trades\u201d  yet somehow not good at any one particular skill yet always winning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe protag: i really dislike these types of characters if its not pre-planned, because they seem to have this mindset that everything must go their way regardless of what you want both IC and OOC. in a public setting i try and outright avoid these people since it'll only cause drama\n\n(bonus points if its a self insert too)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fandom fanfic character: these people are just kinda cringey, there's nothing wrong with playing as a fandom character but the is plenty wrong with not playing at all to how they are in the medium they're from. these types also seem to always be shippers from what i've noticed too, having them outright ignore relationships established **in** the fandom just so they can have their ship (looking at you RWBY rpers)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLOL SO RANDOM: i outright hate these people, random isn't funny and to make it funny you need to put in a lot of effort to make it work, and actually write a character that's more than the sum of their parts... these people tend to not do that, i've had quite a sour experiances with these types so maybe its my own bias clouding it. but i'm still salty over the time one of them literally teleported behind me and choked out my character because she was a little bitchy to them, and the had done nothing but treat her poorly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe romanticist: you know the type, won't tell you they want to try and romance but will openly flirt, and sometimes be openly sexual with your character, romance is fun to write and can be really heartwarming and fun if you actually have an ongoing IC relationship that isn't toxic, random, spur of the moment, and genuinely enjoyed by both parties. but gods be damned if the people who force romance aren't annoying to deal with\n\nthe worst part is when they're a god character/godmodding person too, nothing worse than having someone want to force a relationship and then using bad character writing as a means to try and get it. I've unfortunately scrapped more than 2 characters thanks to these types, its just not fun having them around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe white knight: any one who's done any kind of public RP will know this type and i don't think i really need to explain it more than this. i've had more than a few funny stories of just RPing, doing normal stuff in a public setting, and then having some guy come in from out of nowhere to \"defend\" my character... annoying, but admittedly fun to watch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInnocent characters: this type has bothered me for so long because people seem to get it into their heads that being positive and optimistic = innocent, and dammit i'm sick to death of being babied because my character is a positive and optimistic person. but other than that pet peeve of mine i kind of hate having to baby people or be seen as a terrible person because it just isn't fun. i'm here to write a character and roleplay not create a safespace for someones OC... who knows maybe i'm just bias, but i have yet to have a single good experiance with an innocent character \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least. The pity character: people that write characters who just constantly pity themselves and act \"oh woe is me\" are just not fun to deal with in any atmosphere,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\neveryone starts somewhere, but when people are experianced and do this stuff its really complaint worthy i find. i always try to give people new to RP a little room when they make any of these types, since its really easy to just let your mind go off and write something that isn't good, and you don't have any way to really gauge that yet since you're still new to it... but people with like 10+ years of experiance who make these types of characters have zero excuses lol",
