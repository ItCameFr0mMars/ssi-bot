My advice would be to allow your friends to drift away if that seems to be their preference. Because if they wanted to keep talking to you and hanging out with you, they would probably be doing so already. I'm not saying that to be mean. Not in the slightest. It's just a lesson I've had to learn the hard way. I've ended a few friendships on a sour note by lashing out in anger because I felt abandoned by my friends, when I should have just respected their decision to walk away.\n\nJust keep in mind that, even though it hurts when a friend drifts away, it's not a reflection of your worth as a friend. Their reasons probably have a lot more to do with their wants, needs, and obligations than they have to do with you. And also, I would encourage you to keep trying to develop those friendships. Eventually, some of them will stick, because you'll find people who are looking for the same things you are.",
