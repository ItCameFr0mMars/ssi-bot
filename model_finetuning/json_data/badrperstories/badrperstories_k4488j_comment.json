            "body": "I feel like this is the result of a mix between bad communication and refusal on both of your parts to compromise and be willing to understand each other's point of view.\n\nYou are right that your character shouldn't feel pressured to take their relationship to another level and that they have responsibilities at home and can't spend every moment with your rp partner's character. \n\nHowever, I also get that the other character didn't want to spend time at your character's house, because even if I love rats, real pet rats are different from free roaming wild rats that can carry diseases and are not always human friendly. Moreover, the rats just indicate how bad the state of the house must have been which must be another reason why the other character didn't want to go. I don't understand why your character was so offended by it. Your character had the right to be a bit hurt, but should also have been aware that it wasn't an environment other people would like to spend time in.\n\nAfter that, it feels like both of you refuse to understand and recognize the other character sentiments. While your partner is pushing for a relationship your character isn't ready for, you also say you don't understand how their character could have developed bad feelings towards the relationship. However I find this very plausible because your character sounds somewhat distant and antagonistic to theirs.\n\nLook maybe I'm extrapolating too much from what you've just posted, but the vibe I got is that neither of you are communicating correctly in or out of character. And also that you both are way too attached to your ideas to make compromises or at least be understanding. However, if you could provide examples of how they were playing victim, maybe it would help me understand exactly your point of view.",

That's really kinda gross, I can't blame them for not wanting to play in a rat infested house, that's kinda messed up to put them in that spot where they're the asshole for saying no to that limit. Yeah, I don't think they handled it like an adult and the victim mentality is frustrating, but I can't blame them for struggling to see your side.",

You both stood your ground whenever it came to how your character feels, how they would handle the situation they've found themselves in and so forth. Which is a reasonable thing for all of us to do because when it comes down to it the only person who really knows our character(s) inside and out is us.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this is the outcome because this is one of those issues that really could've been avoided if someone had just made a compromise or done something so that both parties could have had their needs met without neglecting or dismissing\u00a0 the other person's feelings.\u00a0\n\nI can see where you're both coming from.
