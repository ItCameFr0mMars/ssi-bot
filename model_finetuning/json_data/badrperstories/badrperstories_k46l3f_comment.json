I'm happy to let them have their fun with like-minded people.\n\nHowever, I cannot stand when these same people pretend to want something different just so they can ship with you.  I will admit that I adore rping out romances.  I am also very clear that I want them to be secondary to a main storyline, slow-building, and unfold somewhat realistically.  The amount of people who say they want the same thing and then push for romance asap is crazy.\n\nIt also sucks when you find someone who is great to play with up until the characters actually get together, but then morph into the type of player you've described.",

Those that just go on and on and on with the most droll and uninspired \"romance\" are... well they are likely just incredibly lonely. And as to why that is...

Is this subreddit not dedicated to partially complaining about these sorts of things one witnesses in roleplays?\n\nMary Sues? Maybe people want to write a character that is an idealised self insert to escape from their real life issues, with a character that blazes through problems like nobody's business.\n\nBAMFs that get all the girls/boys? Maybe people want to write a character to distract themselves from their own issues of loneliness and insecurities.\n\nWe could go in circles playing devil's advocate and I do appreciate the fact that you agree with me, but I'm here on this subreddit to vent about something that frustrates me from a writer's point of view. If I and other people constantly thought about the ambiguity of the other person and their life behind the screen, then I bet a lot of posts on this subreddit wouldn't exist.",
