And the soldiers are demonized for trying to kill them. \n\nBut I understand what you\u2019re saying. I do have a question though. Was I overreacting a bit with the bullies part? It just pissed me off how they kept dismissing the idea of them being bullies and even made some good canon characters say some stupid shit like \u201cthose poor guys\u201d over and over again.",
