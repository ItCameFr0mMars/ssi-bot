            "body": "Although I understand, and in more extreme cases even sympathise, I don't agree that seeking out the opposite sex is always driven by ulterior motives. I'm a woman and I have always felt most comfortable with the opposite sex.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking solely from my own experiences growing up and being within this hobby I have always found girls to be more passive aggressive, bitchy, dramatic, immature and manipulative. Whereas with guys it's more relaxed and you can actually have a good time without having to deal with the snide little remarks that are disguised as 'jokes', the backhanded compliments that are actually insults, bad mouthing your so called 'BFF' as soon as they leave the room and last, but not least, the gossiping.\u00a0\n\nGuys, from my experience at least, are chill. You have a problem with them and you can actually communicate that said problem without having a screaming match, the situation becoming petty or having things be \"ok\" but they're not actually ok. And this is all coming from a girl!\n\nBy no means am I saying that all women are like this. Just because you come across a few cunts, dicks and pricks throughout your lifetime doesn't mean that the majority of the human population isn't capable of being decent. There are decent and respectful people out there.\n\nSo whenever I'm seeking out my potential roleplay partner I do prefer that said partner to be a he rather than a she. It's not because I'm fishing for a boyfriend, sex, money or anything else of that nature. It just so happens that I've had a more positive experience, and getton on better with the opposite sex, than I do with the same sex.\u00a0\n\nSexuality, on the other hand, is not a complicated thing for me. I really couldn't care less what the sexual orientation of my partner is. And unless they feel the need to put it out there it's not something that I would bring up or otherwise even think about to be honest.\u00a0\n\nIn saying all this, I don't object to roleplaying with the same sex as myself. Or whatever gender my partner may or may not be in real life. I just prefer to roleplay with men because of my experiences with them.\u00a0\n\nHowever, I do ask for pronouns so I know how to address my partner out of character. If they don't wish to provide that information then they at least can make up a name for me to address them by. I don't exactly feel comfortable addressing my partner as You, It and etc. It's rude and downright disrespectful.\u00a0\n\nPlease don't assume the worst case scenario about a person. Not everyone has ulterior motives. Yes, there are a lot of perverts out there. Especially within this hobby. Unfortunately it's one of the downsides about this hobby. Point being is, don't let the dirt-bags ruin this for you. Block, delete and move on.\u00a0",

That's all down to them being an asshole and having hidden agendas under the guise of roleplaying. So yes. I can agree with you that an individual's gender, sexual orientation or sexual preference shouldn't become a stereotype for an automatic label of; \"You're an asshole because you're X/Y/Z.\" Or \"You're a pervert because you're X/Y/Z.\"\n\nHowever, if anyone were to have more than one bad experience with that particular group then of course it would only be natural for us to develop a preference for who we roleplay with judging by the experiences we've had. And it just so happens that my positive experiences are 83% men. And not only in terms with roleplay but with real life too. So yes, I seek out the opposite sex because it just so happens that my positive experiences come more from men than women.\n\nPoint being is, we all have preferences based on previous experiences and overall enjoyment. Is that a bad thing? No. The only thing that can make it bad is whenever we automatically assume a person is an asshole, pervert, vulgar or otherwise unkind based on their in real life identity, sexual orientation and sexual preference. Which shouldn't be the case but unfortunately it can be.\n\nWhich is why I don't object to roleplaying with the same sex or any gender out there but I will admit that I do have a preference for male partners because of my experience with them. If that makes any sense?\n\nThere shouldn't be such requirements based on a person's gender. For example, if my partner were a male in real life but he wanted to play a female character then I'd be more than ok with that. At the end of the day it's my partners character and I wouldn't say no, you can't play this role because you're male or you can't portray this role because your character is a female. That's not how it works. \n\nThe only time a requirement should come into play is whenever you put an ad up saying that you want your partner to play a specific sex. For example, I can put my flair up as F4A playing M. \n\nAnd I agree with you. It's roleplay and the whole point of roleplay is to stray from ourselves and be who we aren't. That's why we create these worlds and characters in the first place. To get away from reality and to have fun.",
