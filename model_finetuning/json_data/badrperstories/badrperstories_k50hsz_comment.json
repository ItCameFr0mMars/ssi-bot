            "body": "Man, I feel this in my *soul*. When I was RPing in FFXIV it was hard to find a group that didn't use dice rolls for all group RPs and even some 1-on-1 RPs. And I just... I understand that some people really get a kick out of leaving things to chance. I do. And I also get that some people got into online RP through D&amp;D. That's more true now than ever, in fact, given how tabletop gaming has gone mainstream. But there's something to be said for actually flexing your creativity a little and making narrative choices based on the setting and on your character's personality and skill set. Most fiction writers don't roll a die to determine what happens in their books. They use their imaginations to determine what events will lead to the most interesting outcomes. RPers should be given the option to do the same, at least part of the time.\n\nPeople automatically assume that if you don't want to use dice, you just want to showboat. But no, sometimes I want my character to get injured. Sometimes I want them to fuck up real bad and make people mad at them. And yeah, sometimes, I want them to be able to do something they're canonically good at and not have to depend on a dice roll to tell me whether they succeeded. It's all about opening up new avenues for storytelling and character development, and dice can seriously get in the way of that sometimes.",

They're not my favorite combat method, but I don't mind dice rolling and some systems do work a little better with them.\n\nWhat I don't like is the attitude that they're necessary to prevent godmodding, people trying to steal the spotlight, or fights where no one wants to lose.

            "body": "I think it really depends on the RP and the REASON for having something like stats, a combat system, and/or dice when you're not playing D&amp;D.\n\nThe problem with a completely RP system and \"no powerplaying\" is that the definition of powerplaying can be fairly subjective, so some games/systems NEED a method of determining outcomes, whether that's stats or dice or both. Stats and/or dice are an unbiased way of resolving an argument and also can keep a mod, event runner, or DM-like position from funneling all the wins and/or good loot to a certain person or group. \n\nBut stat and/or dice rolling systems are also limiting. A hard stats system without dice rolls has inflexibility and inequalities and dice systems have a lot of randomness, these can be partially amended with a scaling modifier system plus dice rolls (although then we're getting into D&amp;D lol). I've seen sort of hybrid systems, where hard stats applied in circumstances A, B, and C, but adherence to stats was relaxed to a policy of playing reasonably for your level in many other areas of the RP. \n\nA lot of shonen fandom RPs are based around training, power levels, etc and there's plenty of room for D&amp;D-like systems for original games, too. So in games like this where there's combat and a need to resolve things in some manner, stats and/or dice rolls are good. Otherwise you're just going to get too much powerplaying and the mods get run down having to debate/argue every instance of powerplay. \n\nBut if you're RPing that you're in a magic school or some sort of slice of life RP, I can see where dice rolls and/or stats are just tedious and not fun or relevant. I remember a story someone told me where they were in a magical school and had to roll for all sorts of things. She wanted to trip her rival and rolled a 1, which was an absolute worse outcome, and the result was that her rival fell down the stairs and broke her neck and died. The rival character's player was PISSED and since my friend was a newcomer to the RP, she was promptly torn into and ostracized from further RP for offing the other character. Definitely an example where dice rolling is completely detrimental and shouldn't even be a thing.",

It depends on the mods.\n\nI mostly roleplay in fantasy servers with no dice in combat, and ultimately I only use dices to decide which of the four hazards or enemies the group may find, what riddle they may solve, what NPC they may find but without telling my members about it. \n\nI have been in a couple of server using dices, but when all it's left to random, and without stats involved, you're toasted, but I also met people who created a neat simple system that ensure everything stays logical and on terms.\n\nSo I guess it depends from RP to RP.\nPowerplayers always find a way to cheese the roleplay after all, and it's the mod duty to shut them down anyway, so I decided to stay without a dice and give everyone the benefit of doubt with ocs and their actions. \nEdgelords, Mary Sues will surely come but they'll have to get past approval and then they'll be monitored.
