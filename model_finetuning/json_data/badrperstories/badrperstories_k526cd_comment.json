            "body": "That's one of the things that turns me off about \"multi para\" writers. Way too many of them write so much action that then they're whisking events along so far that it's robbing me of the ability to post my character reactions and influence what's going on. I also encounter a lot of purple prose filler nonsense that tends to be stuff that I can't reasonably react to, like an in depth analysis of their character's thoughts. OK, cool that you're that into your character and having fun with that, but my character can't mind read or respond to your non-actions except to fidget uncomfortably at the silence and being stared at. \n\nAnd a lot of them view their minimum requirements as \"quality control\" and a mark of how good they are that they produce a minimum of 2 or 5 or whatever paragraphs. No, a good measure of quality is how interactive the RP is and how much room you leave for other RPer(s) to have agency and respond equally. \n\nThings that can call for a lot of writing though are descriptions and scene sets, so sure. And it's entirely possible to have very meaningful one liner posts that can provoke lengthy responses from the person answering them. Things like \"Did anything interesting happen today?\" gives the other RPer a TON of leeway to write as much or little as they'd like. It's all about balance and interaction.",

My rp partners are all over the place.  I have one where each post is about a paragraph, one where it's around 3-4 paragraphs, and one that's usually 6+ paragraphs.  They're all equally great because they put effort into giving me things to work with.  Sometimes the 6+ one does have a bit of controlling the other character involved, but it's always been discussed ooc beforehand.\n\nThe time skip thing is one of my biggest pet peeves, though.

I like people who can also write multiple paragraphs and help me flesh the story out; I don't want to or expect to carry them and their characters throughout the length of our RP.\n\nWhen it comes to action scenes and reacting, I'm on the fence. I don't generally mind people actioning my characters in their post about if it's not a life-changing decision and moves the story along (I am also way more comfortable with this if it's someone I've been writing with for a little while); if it's serious and more important, we better have a discussion before you make any major moves.
