            "body": "I had a similar problem where I had a friend that ALWAYS wanted an FxF ship to be part of their roleplay.  The best thing is to be gently honest.  Tell her you've lost interest in the character and that you're not really looking to add in any romance, but you'd still like to play with her, maybe as a best friend or sibling.  She's going to be disappointed and maybe even a little upset if she thinks you've led her on, so give a little extra leeway after breaking the news.  See how she's feeling after a bit of time passes.\n\nIf she takes it well and still wants to rp, then that's great.  You've got a partner who listens and cares about your enjoyment.\n\nIf she takes it well, but doesn't want to rp anymore, then you have someone who cares about your enjoyment even if you're not compatible. Maybe you'll even rp something else again in the future.\n\nIf she takes it excessively poorly, then that sucks, but she's shown that what you want doesn't matter to her.  Save yourself the drama that comes with that sort of partner.",

Maybe she's the same. And that's okay -- could be that the two of you just aren't compatible in that way. But I'd be honest with her about what you need/prefer. You'll just end up resenting it too much otherwise if you go along with it and aren't really into it. If you're more accustomed to group RPs, maybe y'all can bring in another player to help her scratch that romance itch, and let you off the hook. But basically, don't force yourself to do something you're not going to enjoy. If I were in her shoes, I'd hate to know that my partner was just going through the motions but not really enjoying it.

To me it sounds like you never actually told her that you don't want to RP this character anymore, that you don't like romantic arcs, that her requests were making you uncomfortable, and now you've become resentful that she's not \"getting it\", but it doesn't sound like you've actually told her to stop? Like, it's reasonable to expect a person to get that you're not into it after you've said no a few times, but you also have a responsibility to your friend (and to people in your life in general) to communicate clearly and not expect them to be able to guess what you're thinking.",

It's hard, and I'm sorry.\n\nI sympathize with you here.  I like playing all kinds of characters, but 1) it appears to me that more rpers are female and 2) more female rpers only play females and 3) more female rpers want a straight romance.  That leaves me playing a male character fairly often, despite being a straight cis woman in my real life.  \n\nRight now I have six 1x1 roleplays going (because all but one are fairly slow posters).  In half of them I'm playing a male character, and in the other half a female.  One of the male ones is MxM, one is MxF, and one has a male and a female character but the story is platonic.  There were two others recently, both female rpers, and one of them was mf-potential-romance and one was platonic.  One ghosted at the planning stage and I ended it with the other over an incompatibility in our roleplaying preferences that took a while to present itself clearly (I'm still debating if it deserves a post here or not).\n\nPlatonic-friendly rpers can be harder to find, but they're definitely out there if you keep looking.",
