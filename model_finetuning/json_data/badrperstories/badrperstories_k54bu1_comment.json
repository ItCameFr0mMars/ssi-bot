This went from 0 to 100 in a matter of days. \nI believe this stuff right here (besides the threat) is 100% illegal as he at least got your personal email and tried to access your stuff without consent. \nI believe postal police can and must be contacted in this case.\nAnd I believe (for how crappy Discord support is) that create multiple accounts to harass a user is also against ToS.\nFrom a bad roleplay story we ended up in a case that could end up in a court room.\n\nI believe badrpstories should be mostly used for this kind of stuff. Not encouraging witch huntings on people (no matter how shitty this kind of people are, no one should descend to their levels and be shitty like them by doxxing/stalking or insulting them), but at least, tell us the story in a constructive way and how to avoid that person/group.\n\nSpeaking personally I guess my issues weren't as much grave as a case of doxxing mentioned in the OP, but I will keep on making sure that what is wrong will be pointed out and potentially reach up other people not to fall in my same mistakes/situations.\nThank you for speaking up.",
