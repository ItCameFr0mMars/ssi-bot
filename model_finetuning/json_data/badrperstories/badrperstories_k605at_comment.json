We generally don't want people pulling out surprises during ERP without consent, because if they don't have consent to do it then they're going to make their partner uncomfortable at best, or feel like they've been sexually violated at worst. *Maybe* that would be fine in a \"consensual non-consent\" community where your (or your character's) presence alone is considered an invitation for lewd acts, but even in these communities, you're typically expected to not introduce something unless you know your partner will be into it too.\n\nIf you're not straightforward with what you want in an ERP community, then chances are you're just going to get yourself kicked out of said ERP community. If A creep gets banned from one too many places, they tend to stop looking for partners in ERP circles.",
