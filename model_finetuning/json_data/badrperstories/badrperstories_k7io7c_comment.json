            "body": "I can see that getting very ugly very quickly, personally. I can see creeps and abusers using it to further harass RPers who had good reasons for wanting to get away from them. I can see it doing harm to people who ghost out of fear of confrontation rather than out of maliciousness. I can even see it being used to dogpile RPers who have busy personal lives and let some RPs lapse because they're tired and stressed.\n\nThere are so many reasons to ghost that don't involve any sort of ill intent. And while yes, there are probably people out there who ghost just because they can't be bothered to politely end an RP they aren't enjoying, I don't necessarily think even they deserve to be \"reported.\" Technically, they do have a right to walk away from RP without warning if they so choose. A sub like the one you described would likely generate a lot of unnecessary negativity and be used as a tool of revenge more than a tool to actually help RPers.\n\nInstead, people who get ghosted consistently and can't seem to hold onto *any* of their RP partners might want to head over to r/ooc and get some advice. Maybe ask for some help with writing or character development or OOC communication, because something clearly isn't working. I'm not trying to say that anyone deserves to be ghosted (aside from abusers), or that ghosting is always the fault of the person who gets ghosted. Not at all. I've been ghosted myself. I get it. But if someone is having trouble keeping any of their RPs going due to constant ghosting, it might be worth seeing if there's an issue on their end that could be resolved.",

When we couldn't line up/ mesh with what we wanted out of the plot you told me respectfully that you were more interested in on aspect over another and I politely accepted that and wished you the best, dropping it, did I not? I didn't guilt you and you didn't just ghost. I can't speak for you but from my side there were no hard feelings and I understood where you were coming from. That's all i really request of people. Consideration of one's feelings. But at the same time it's frustrating to build a plot, make a character and a starter and see you've been dropped.

A trio of close friends ghosted me a few years ago, and it was such a painful experience that I decided I never wanted to inflict that pain on someone else. But I do have some advantages that some other RPers don\u2019t. I\u2019m disabled, which is obviously not an advantage in and of itself, but I only work on a very part time basis because of it, so it\u2019s a little easier for me to keep my RPs from lapsing by accident than it would be for someone with a packed schedule and a lot of responsibilities. I also have a good idea of what I want from RP, so I can tell pretty early on if I\u2019m not going to enjoy an RP dynamic, and I can say something before my partner gets too invested. And I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for at least 20 years, so I\u2019ve had a lot of help developing skills to navigate potentially unpleasant social situations. As a result, I\u2019m less afraid of how other people will react if I disappoint or anger them than I would have been years ago. \n\nNot everyone has the same experiences and advantages that I do, though, and this is a particularly difficult time for many. A lot of people are swamped with work, school, or childcare responsibilities. Many are battling mental illness, some of them for the first time. Tons of people are exhausted on a physical, emotional, and even spiritual level. And too many people are grieving right now. And for some of those people, RP might be a refuge, but it might simultaneously feel like a relatively low priority. Something to enjoy, but not something to waste precious energy on if it stops being enjoyable. Do I feel like that\u2019s a good excuse for ghosting? Mm, maybe not entirely, but it\u2019s one that makes sense to me.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry for rambling, but I wanted to both acknowledge the fact that you\u2019re hurt, and also to make a case for compassion. I suspect that most RPers, even those who ghost, are probably doing the best they can under the circumstances. I would like to see more people learn better communication skills so ghosting becomes less common, but what I don\u2019t want to see is a new source of strife in the RP community. We\u2019re all going through enough right now.",

I can't understand why that is so hard for people, especially considering the amount of sensitive or mentally ill people there are. I myself am incredibly sensitive but love when someone can be honest over being uncaring. Everyone has bad days and unexpected things but for the same reason as you ( kinda of) I do my best to be mindful of others and their feelings. It's just infuriating when you spend your life being kind and when you get frustrated or stop being a doormat you're bad. I genuinely wanted to vent my frustrations but got attacked and that's exactly the kind of thing and person who I mean when I talk about consideration.",
