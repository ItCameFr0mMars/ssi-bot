            "body": "Getting ghosted is a really crappy feeling, it happened to me for the first time a week or two ago and as i myself had been using rping as escapism to cope with my mother's death, i took it personally as i didn't know what went on since things were going really well. I wondered what I did wrong and generally felt really shitty. Still, at least you feel remorseful for it and are considering the feelings of others, which is very important and sets you apart. You can't be fully blamed for it as something happened though, so while i get that it seems daunting I think you should send a messaging explaining what was going on ( though you don't need to go into detail if you aren't comfortable) and that you were overwhelmed and needed to cut and run to manage. While you don't owe anyone details there's a lot of good in closure and it will make them feel better. It's cathartic and good karma and while you were going through a lot, you also never know what people are going through or if they have a mental illness that can be really effected by being dropped like that. I know i would appreciate it and i think they will too. It isn't on you if they choose to hold a grudge but you can take responsibility for your actions and do your best. I hope this helped you and I'm sorry for whatever you went through that made you overwhelmed. This year was hard enough.",
