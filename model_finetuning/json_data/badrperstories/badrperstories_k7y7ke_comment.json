It happened to me recently even though I know I hadn't done anything. I felt very frustrated because of this and found myself wondering why people were so selfish to not say anything. While unaware of what they're going through i found myself comparing them to myself, who even when struggling still considering feelings to send a message that i need a break. You at least are feeling remorse over it.\n\nSo while I get the anxiety over logging in, it's clearly weighing on you and I think you'll feel better saying something and that they will too.   You don't have to go into details, that's your right, but even just explaining that you were having a tough time with something and couldn't focus is enough of a reason. If they don't accept you prioritizing your mental health over things then they're in the wrong. You apologizing for it is the right thing to do in my opinion. I honestly wish you well with it should you decide to. Good luck.",
