For example, if you're using combat, you need a way to grade character strength. \n\nI believe I reiterated what happened; generally, in the server, characters that are from the Uchiha Clan, save for his, are forced to be 15 and under years old. \n\nHe knew full well my character was 15 and when I was talking about her changing her shoes a lot he immediately started inquiring if her feet were smelly. Knowing that this is his kink and having genuine proof he enjoys it as well as being surrounded by minors in a server, he shouldn't be *doing that.* He's done it without people being aware of it for some time and he often mentions feet amongst doing strange stuff with character's feet. He's done weird stuff to one of mine before, although it was a different character and I was unaware then- \n\nBut my character's 15, he started making comments inquiring about her feet. It's not right. It really isn't. The server had a no-NSFW policy, and just because he owns it he can not only apparently break that but make uncomfortable comments inquiring about his fetish regarding a 15-year-old character.",
