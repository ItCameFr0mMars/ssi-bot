            "body": "I rarely join servers i do not know very well, but I often like to have all the roleplay channels visible already (some people hide them from new members until they get a roleplay tag by posting a sheet)\n\nI enjoy when the literacy level is moderate: the roleplay it isn't a bunch of oneliners speedtyping around but also not that  a place where you need to always be Dante and write at least 6 paragraph minimum to agree to another characters otherwise you are banned.\n\nI appreciate a medium/long length character sheet and when the admins are not uptight snobs who think they are the best of the best and unless you lick their boots you won't be treated as a human (while the bootlikers get to do whatever they want without being affected by rules).\n\nAs for my experience as an admin/mod, it's a thankless job but one you are passionate about. You will definitely find people who won't like what you do regardless how much you try, Billy the Badass will come and propose you roleplay ideas and characters to fuel their plotless powerdrunk fever. You will also get people that started just to rp and they are trying their best to keep up with the rhythm. The plot most likely won't advance unless you are there to push it forward.\nI think you got to be as prepared as you can, in your rules and mindset and worldbuilding. You won't probably be able to satisfy everyone, and some people just won't jam with the server, you must be strict and say that no is no and that's it. On the other hand, you will have to be also friendly and nice. Juggle these two thing is still difficult for me, but rules enforce your order, so do not be shy to write down whatever you do not want to see in your place.\n\nAlso, the worldbuilding, try as much as you can to plan it out to not have to invent too much on the fly when the rp has started, but also leave yourself space to be fluid and change some details. You will probably have a story in mind, but do not forget to regularly keep your players compelled to it, without railroading them too much. Listen to the interests of the characters and players alike, as they may enjoy stop what they are doing for a sidequest you planned or something you want to write for your enjoyment, but also do let them have some loose time for their romances or free time, for the reason that be bombarded by events and quests makes the rp chat to overburn. \n\nIf you got a partner mod/admin into this, listen to them and never over shadow them. Dialogue and transparency is key (plus it helps having someone direct rp for you once in a while). Always propose things to them and decide together the best outcome. Never impose something \"from above\" to someone who's supposed to be your equal. \n\nI guess I do not have nothing to say anymore as for now.\n\nI usually go for the old Latin proverb about the golden mean. \nNever exceed one extreme or another as there lies injustice and extremism. Seek the golden, moderated middle of everything, as it is the balance between the two extremes.",

            "body": "I love RP groups that are inclusive and encourages everyone to get to know each other and avoid cliques and bubble RPing. Also, bots are fun, but no rush to get into that.\n\nIf you're doing a fandom server, allowing the lore to be adaptable and up to interpretation, to an extent of course, is also fun. Some servers are too rigid with the lore and it's more fun to have people add a little something to it, but not go crazy, ya know? Like, if there's a piece of canon lore that's not explained to well and they want to expand on it with mod permission, that is great!\n\nA GOOD MOD TEAM. So many times have I seen mods on a team that really either don't know what they are doing or just like to flaunt the power. And set a comfortable number of mods you're willing to have on the team. If the group is small yet have an amount of mods that majorly dwarfs normal members, that looks very intimidating. Maybe start with a couple and add more as more people join and more responsibilities need handling.\n\nTry not to be a push over. Trust me, I've ran groups myself and it's so easy to try and want to appease everyone's ideas. It's okay to be lenient in some areas, but don't let the members overrun you and your server and making it turn into something you never wanted. If there are set rules, make sure they abide by them accordingly and if you have concerns about their character powers/backstory, don't be afraid to address them, or they'll think they can get away with anything.",

            "body": "I'd always be careful of people who try to ask tricky questions and skirt around certain aspects of lore and so on. Sometimes people will try to get away with skirting around the rules, or see if they can make their character super special, but not through actual RPing and through character development, simply straight off the bat. I'd also be careful of complicated systems, because I know that turns a lot of people off, though I understand the want and need for more rigid lore. It's a delicate balance imo\n\nMake sure your admins/yourself aren't really stiff and unapproachable, I know it's a simple thing, but I can't tell you how many unpleasant staff teams are out there. I always run a policy of open DMs and open to being pinged, because sometimes people have a question they don't want to ask aloud or something. And I've seen people belittled for asking questions. I think the only time it's acceptable to be rude to a person, its when they're rude to you first and even then, you have to retain that professional edge, y'know? I had a guy argue with me about my own rules and stated that \"no one would be stupid enough to write an essay for a backstory\" and I pretty much told him to fuck off for insulting my server and my player base. I'm perfectly nice in the meantime of course. \n\nAnother thing I like to also do is ban certain hot button topics. I don't have vent channels, because I believe they can become hugboxes of dangerous behaviour and they're hard to have rules for because venting is venting and all that. Strangers on an online RP server are not a good substitute for therapy. I also ban politics, because that is nothing but misery and no one ever leaves happy after a political discussion that descends into shit flinging.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve pretty much solely done group rps and my group recently moved to Discord for our newest Rp.\n\nAs admins, advertising has been pretty rough! So it\u2019ll be good if you already have a small collection of friends to bulk out the group while you slowly pick up new people. If you\u2019re silently relying on new people, it might take too long to start of and people will lose interest and leave.\n\nHaving plenty of rules is good, but you can also overdo it. For OOC stuff, do be strict, draw lines where they need to be, don\u2019t put up with bullshit cause people will always try to push your limits if you don\u2019t put your foot down. For character related things, it\u2019s good to be a bit more gentle about it. Make some guidelines, but avoid making super strict rules that limit creativity. That especially goes for fantasy species and powers and stuff. People are going to come up with an ability or species idea that they really like and they\u2019re gonna want to find a way to pull it off with the preexisting lore.\n\nFor lore heavy groups, you\u2019ll probably want a lore page and to separate things out into information people need to know and things that are more flavor text. It\u2019ll also be a good idea to have a chat for asking questions, a chat for giving new ideas, a chat for venting, and then a normal group chat. If a roleplay group doesn\u2019t have a talking channel, that\u2019s almost always a major red flag since group roleplays tend to thrive on feelings of community!\n\nFor group rps, you might also consider a spots page if there\u2019s certain things that would be limited. Like, say, the queen of this country or the principal of so and so magic school. Not all groups need something like this, but for a fantasy group I would recommend it.\n\nDifferent roleplay topics for different areas is good if you\u2019re working with a very large world. If it\u2019s like a single city or something, I\u2019d just have one topic and have people preface their replies with a header on where their character is.\n\nAs an admin, if you do have a lot of friends in the group, pretty much make sure you always have characters reserved to the side for new roleplayers since it always sucks joining a group only for everybody there to be roleplaying with each other and never interacting with anybody knew. Jumping into a new group can be very difficult and so having a character to offer new people helps make the place seem very comfortable.\n\nMy groups have always told stories with a sort of arc structure. The beginnings of a story will happen, it\u2019ll reach it\u2019s climax, and eventually conclude with aspects of that arc effecting later arcs. If you go by a similar process, try to offer opportunities to participate in these arcs to people. Say you\u2019re gonna have an arc about a mysterious virus that\u2019s starting to spread. It\u2019d be good to ask the group for if anybody wants to volunteer as the patient 0s for this virus. It can give newer members the chance to make their characters feel more important and nothing quite feels as good in an rp than feeling like your character matters.\n\nGood luck with your group!",

            "body": "I really appreciate the second utility \"transparency and open communication\" - in my experience, both are vital and yet both are frequently neglected by Mods.  \n\n\nI'd also add in some form of mechanic to help new players in your server. I'm not talking about new roleplayers in general, rather players who are new to your system. Whether it's a buddy-system where you paid new players with seasoned players or you just have a Mod whose job is specifically to set up scenes for brand new players. What I've seen is that most roleplayers suffer from anxiety, they join, and then they just sit there until they're kicked for inactivity because they are too shy to dive right in. Having someone whose job is set to handle those new players, ensures that you know you've done everything you can to make your players feel welcome and included. If they leave, that's on them, but you know and the rest of your server knows that you made every effort.   \n\n\nFor me, an immediate red flag in a server is when I see the staff are inactive or unwilling to write with new players. You can't preach to your players to become active if your staff, the people who created the server, aren't even passionate enough about their own server to be active. Every story I've ever joined that has inactive or cliqueish staff has flopped in a maximum of 5 months, usually closer to 3 though.   \n\n\nLastly, beta test your lore before you launch and don't get hung up on member counts.  \n It may seem obvious and easy to grasp to you, because you wrote it, but bring in a few random players and have them read it and explain it to you. Ask them to conceptualize a few random characters. Adjust your lore based on that. For all you know, you might have left a massive plot hole, and then if you launch before testing, you'll have people who come in and play something that exploits that plot hole. Now, if you say no to them, they'll be able to say \"well you're supposed to be transparent, I want to play this and you're not letting me\" and then you run the risk of earning a bad rep over a very small error.   \n Similarly, some players will be pushy and they'll play on your insecurities. Make sure they all know you're aim is for quality of players, not quantity, or they'll walk all over you. Having 100+ members doesn't mean you're successful or running a good story. It just means you have 100 people in your story.",
