I say this as, when I was a teen, I was one of those people. What happened on site (I forum roleplay) was where all my energy was going and when my partners logged on, I expected their attention to be fully on our plots. I didn\u2019t understand for other people, this was a hobby they did around their commitments and other interests. To me it was all-consuming and I didn\u2019t understand how it wasn\u2019t for them. It made me an unpleasant, easily offended and impatient partner.\n\nEventually I realised this and made a longterm effort to change it. It\u2019s only now with perspective (and an awareness of my internet addiction) that I actually see this, though.\n\nHaving returned to roleplay, I see a lot of players who\u2019re suffering from being in the same situation but the reasons for it can be multiple and difficult to address (mental health, illness, stress relief). So, I\u2019ve come to accept that there are some partners I\u2019m just not compatible with, due to scheduling or different amounts of investment\u2014in these cases, if they don\u2019t respect my boundaries, I don\u2019t play with them.\n\nThe way I view it, there are different levels to roleplay, like there are any hobby. Some people are here to write the next big epic adventure, some are amateurs who occasionally want to throw a few sentences around. There\u2019s no shame in finding someone on the same commitment level. They\u2019d probably be happier to find someone on theirs, too.",

And another who would *ping me in the server* if I didn't reply within an hour. For a hobby built around collaboration, a surprising number of roleplayers are disrespectful shitheads. I mean, look at this sub.\n\nYou mentioned in a comment that you tell people ahead of time that you're not a 24/7 poster, which is a good idea. I do the same thing. At that point, if people ignore what you've told them up front, that's on them. Sounds like this person was a nightmare all around. Maybe the SW fandom just attracts writers like that? I've found that a lot of my Star Wars rps have ended up ending for the same reason, the other person wanting a faster reply speed than I can give them.\n\nKeep looking!

I have to do things the entire time I'm at work, and once you factor in those 40+ hours of working plus commuting (this was pre-Covid) PLUS getting home and having to make food, clean, take care of pets, spend time with the SO, etc, I don't always have the time, energy, or muse to RP. Just because you have a shit ton of time does not mean that everyone else does.\n\nAnyway, I went on a mini-rant there myself (I've also felt the shame and sass that you've experienced), but long story short, I think it's like what others have mentioned. For some people, RP is a massive chunk of their life, and I can see how it would be frustrating when you're then waiting around for the other person to respond. Annoying af and unwarranted when people get mad at you for having a life, but ultimately both partners need to be on the same page. If they're okay with the fact that my responses will sometimes be sporadic and require long periods of waiting, great. If not, they're free to find another partner that can respond just as quickly as them. I understand that not everyone wants to wait for me and that my routinely chaotic schedule can be a bit frustrating, but there's no need to shame me and get pissed off for dealing with things that are out of my control.",
