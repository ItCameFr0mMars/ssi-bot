Instead go for \"I'll send my stuff and a starter if you want and if that's something you can roll with, then we agree to rp\", and if they dip out then maybe it hurts a little less as far as disappointment goes.\n\nJust a suggestion though, cuz at this rate I'm thinking they have very specific ideas for what they want but are too shy or creepy to outright say it because they're afraid they'll get denied, and instead choose to bail first. Ya know, the \"you don't break up with me, I break up with you\" ideology.\n\nOn that note, I'd offer to casually rp with you but I know I have time issues and don't want to get added to that list of ghosts because I got drained from work. Hope you find someone that sticks around or at the very least can say \"yeah, not my jam\"",

It's easy to be told you dodged a bullet but you're still wondering why it happened, and if it happens more than once you start to think it's you.\n\nThat's what happened to me. I planned out everything with the person and they did a starter, I responded and then they were gone. It was very confusing. I was frustrated as I hadn't done anything and the previous months someone i was well into an rp with just disappeared and I made an angry post. I didn't get the support i wished for and in fact got blamed for it by a commenter , so i wanted to extend my condolences to you for your frustration. I don't think me telling you it's not you will help in the moment but consider the fact that some people just enjoy making people feel like garbage. Don't let them. It's hard for me to take my own advice here but you genuinely cannot be at fault every time. You know yourself and if you know you didn't do anything creepy or insulting you should take care in knowing that it's the other person who is the problem.",
