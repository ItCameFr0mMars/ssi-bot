I personally tell someone why it isn't working out. \n\nI think one of few times I didn't include it in my message was when I wrote a very detailed initial setting for an rp with multiple entries on discord. I asked them to reply with a detailed reply to include what brought their character there, physical description of their character and where they were and what they were doing. I got back a short, single paragraph, no attempt to correct clear typos and lowercase i's and as I recall nothing other than basically he walked in and say down. No description, nada. My rp ad stated no single paragraph writers and I reiterated it in the pre-rping conversation along with how important detail and an effort to have decent grammar are to me. My phone hates me and I get mistakes too, but it was such a horrendous lack of effort on a first post. I was so annoyed and the reason was so obvious that they got a very quick this isn't going to work for me and I wish them well in finding a partner better suited. He just left the server without a word, but if he asked me what he'd done Is certainly have told him why.",

I've said that it isn't working for me, as nicely as possible, in the past, and in some instances it's blown up horribly. Some have asked for specific reasons clear to being abusively enraged and insulting/ threatening etc.\n\nAnd I hate to tell people that they aren't a fit for me. I hate to make people think they aren't enough. Because even if I don't want to write with them, or I think they are a bad writer for what I'm doing, I never want to put someone off writing as a whole. I don't want to tell people negative things about their writing. I try to be constructive where I can, but my opinions aren't necessarily right. There are many things that will shape a person's writing in their life. The only truth is that writing is for everyone and there is always going to be other people that will be a fit, on both ends. \n\nSo sometimes I will lie so I'm not crushing anyone, or being rude when I don't have to be, etc. But it also depends on the person and how much I feel I can say without being just super negative or risking anger.\n\nSo while it sucks, blocking someone may be what they need to do for themselves, for their own reasons as well. Often their own anxiety.\n\nThat seems to be something we all have at least a little of in these cases, anxiety. I know I do, to the point that I take a medication for it.\n\nI hope you'll find the best of writing experiences in your future because you do deserve it.",

            "body": "It's a peeve of mine as well, but honestly, the best thing for you will probably be to try to move on and let go. Maybe they lied because they didn't want to address an issue. Maybe they'd just had partners freak out on them or try to guilt trip them into continuing and headed that off before it could happen. Personally, I'm not one to block people unless they actually do something, but it does seem that rp attracts a lot of people with anxiety, so it may have just been easier for them to do that and try to disappear into the void. \n\nThat being said... a little honesty really does go a long way. I had someone tell me that she'd enjoyed writing with me, but didn't have the time to continue. I thanked her for letting me know and wished her well. And then the next day, she posted in multiple search hubs with the exact same ad that I'd answered. I was incredibly tempted to DM her saying something to the effect of, \"You know I can see you posting multiple ads the day after you said you were too busy, right?\" Ultimately I decided it was best to not waste my time on confronting a liar. \n\nSometimes that's the choice you have to make. You can continue to spend effort and energy on a person who's made it clear they don't want to spend effort and energy on you. Or you can look to the future and greener pastures. It can be really hard to stick to the positive path, especially when there's not as much closure as you'd like to have, but at the risk of sounding cliche, there's plenty more fish in the sea!",

That doesn't make you a bad rper, but it is a grand example of how toxic rpers ruin the community for the rest of us.\n\nI do feel your pain though. I've never been blocked, but I get ghosted or people just lay back and let me throw up starters that they never respond to.  Honestly, the not knowing why is the worst. I'm courteous and I put as much information about my preferences and writing style out there to put potential partners at ease. But one thing I have noticed as an older rper that concerns me is how ABYSMAL people's communication skills have gotten. It's no one's responsibility to read another person's mind.  It sounds like a problem with them. Try not to take it too personally, that's key.",

            "body": "&gt; I would prefer it so much more if someone just outright said they weren\u2019t interested in continuing so I could either find a way to resolve the issue or at least know upfront\n\nI think, by the time someone \"breaks up\" with you (whether in roleplay or in real life!), they're probably not interested in resolving any issues that are there. If someone is so frustrated with the RP that they've made the decision to drop, it's likely beyond a point where you can fix it. And sure, sometimes it's truer to say that you don't want to continue rather than you can't, but I get how it's hard to reject someone to their face, and since the outcome of the conversation is ultimately the same, I'm not sure that the exact terminology matters....\n\nI also have anxiety and I definitely struggle with feelings of rejection, but something I've learned is that you can't rely on other people for closure, and fwiw it's up to you to mitigate your anxiety.\n\n&gt; If I did do something wrong, I\u2019d much rather the other person tell me about it so I can work on avoiding it for future RP\u2019s.\n\nA lot of the time though, it's not something you can or should work on. Like, I've left RPs because of someone's writing style, which wasn't bad but not to my taste, or because an incompatibility came out mid-RP (sometimes an OOC one!), or simply because I got bored and I subjectively didn't feel like I gelled enough with that partner to stick around for a different roleplay. It's almost never that they did something \"wrong\" per se - we just weren't a good fit. And even in situations where you could argue they did something subjectively wrong (like bad grammar or bad characterization or something), I personally don't feel comfortable criticizing them for that. RP is something I do for fun and I view my partners as equals; it's not my place to coach them on how to write.\n\nI think, as an anxious person, I tend to \"fixate\" on certain details when I have an unpleasant experience. These details are rarely objectively important, and the fixating behavior harms my mental health, even if having something to concentrate on obsessively helps shift my intense feelings of guilt/dread/shame in the moment. I wonder if you also are fixating right now. It's a maladaptive coping mechanism and therapy or CBD exercises can help.",

I try to make it very clear (in a nice way) that I'm not feeling something and why. The last three times that I've ended a story because I just wasn't feeling it or I didn't have time, I got shit on.   \n\n\nThe first time, it was a writer who kept playing my character for me or otherwise just telling a story where my character was just along for the ride. I tried expressing that I just wasn't into it, but she kept pressing, so finally I explained that her style of writing where I wasn't actually included in anything was honestly boring because I wasn't engaged. She went through the mods of a forum site we used to issue a no contact order, so if we ever ended up in the same server and I talked to her, I was in danger of breaking that order and I could have had my account banned.   \n\n\nThe second time, this guy kept harassing me to write faster in a premise I have no experience in and I'd told him I had very little experience or interest in it. He kept insisting I just needed to google, which maybe I did, but it wasn't a story I wanted to write and he turned down every genre I suggested. When I finally told him \"I don't feel comfortable with this,\" he called me a few names, blocked me, and then dragged me in a server we were both in.   \n\n\nThe third time, I was enjoying the story, but he kept trying to force a romance when I'd been very clear that my character was gay. Finally my character just out and said she only liked women romantically. He owned the server, so he banned me and told everyone that I'd lead him on, when her preference was in her character sheet.   \n\n\nWe're shamed across the board if we ghost, but then we're also penalized if we want to stop a story. There just never seems like a way to end a story nicely. No matter how transparent or compassionate you try to be, there's still going to be people who do a 180, internalize it, and then shit on you for it. Not everyone will, but enough people will to make others feel like they need to just cut all contact. You may think you come off as very level headed, but so did all three of those people I just talked about until I told them I wasn't going to give them what they wanted.   \n\n\nThis person at least told you they weren't going to continue. That's more than a lot of people get, and like you said, you don't know that they actually lied. Sure, it'd be great if everyone was just open and honest without fear of backlash, but that's not the world we live in. Also, for all you know it's just that they changed their security settings so people who share servers are the only ones who can message them, or they might have deleted their account. You were given information that the story wasn't going to continue. The reason doesn't actually matter. You still got closure.",

It's very awkward.  This is why now, when someone ghosts or an rp doesn't work out, I block them on the account I use for rp just to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've had someone come back after ghosting, apologize, and ask to continue or restart on two separate occasions.  In one case I said yes because she was just that good a writer and, while I wasn't sure if I could trust her, I just had to risk it for a quality player in a hard-to-find setting - and she promised to let me know if she had to go again.  So far that trust has paid off.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the other case, another player vanished without explanation, in the middle of an exciting plot plan, after writing over 300 pages.  Then she came back asking to resume, saying her depression and anxiety were just too severe to tell me when she was having personal troubles and needed a break.  I'm *especially* unsympathetic to this because I have these conditions myself.  I function with a routine and meds, but I'll never be \"normal,\" and I work around that.  In spite of this, I've never, not once, exited a roleplay without explanation.  All it takes is literally typing one sentence (and then blocking, if you really can't endure the other person possibly responding).  Not only that, but if I took her back she was just as likely to do the same again, and I didn't want to go through that after making a huge commitment of time and creative energy a *second* time.  So in that case I said politely that I had already moved on to other partners (which was true, and which my profile on my rp subreddit says I will do after a two-week unexplained silence; in her case I actually waited much longer).",
