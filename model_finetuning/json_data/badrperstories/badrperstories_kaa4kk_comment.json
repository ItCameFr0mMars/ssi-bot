But you also probably need to be prepared for things to get ugly if you do. People like the RPer you described tend to be very good at manipulating others and attracting followings. They're also good at adding just enough truth to their lies to make them sound highly plausible. And since they aren't really burdened by conscience, they often fight dirty. So you could easily end up more exhausted and more anxious in the long run.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I believe you're completely in the right, because I have dealt with people exactly like that before. But in my experience, living well really is the best revenge. If you focus on trying to forge new RP connections with people who are actually going to respect you and your ideas, you could end up happier in the long run. But either way, I wish you best, and I'm really sorry you went through this mess.",

It might be best to just PM the proof and explanations to the other members.\n\nIf you PM all of them first, that way if one of them doesn't believe you and snitches to the Thief and they ban you, you can still explain things to the others in PM even if you're no longer in the same server on Discord. When you explain things, make sure to try to stay calm. If you explain things professionally, people are more likely to stay and listen.\n\nI'm sorry that such a thing happened to you and I hope that things go smoothly. If you think it might be best to just leave the group and not deal with the drama, that might be good as well. Be sure to keep that proof so if someone approaches and accuses YOU of copying the Thief, you can show them the proof and explain to that one person.",
