It has a magical system. \nHow the hell can one think it's going to be a smut based server?\n\nNot to take anything away from smut-based roleplay as I ran a small server about it, yet generally smut servers are about... Well... People doing nsfw stuff and that's basically it. There could be a solid plot behind it, but  there isn't a deep research about a magic system, landscape, characters or races unless it is sexual related. \nThose are all just a nice background, but not the main topic of a Nsfw server I guess. (Professional smut players, please correct me in the comments if I am wrong)\n\nI believe this person shouldn't have called you names or prude, expecially since they probably ignored the whole concept of the server you hardly worked on and failed to pick your idea completely. \n\nI guess it happens because these people simply knock at every door of announcement they find themselves at and try to insert their smut fantasy in there, which it would be perfectly fine if them and the other player agreed with and it fits with the pre-established concept.\n\nYours clearly wasn't about people doing smut, and I am sorry you had to go through that.\n\nI personally recall a person posting a character application where this character was written as if the player never read the lore or the setting. When questioned on how this character had as hobby to watch netflix and he was a futuristic metal dragon in human form in a middle age server, as excuse, this person said that \"they wanted to make an overpowered character ladies want to had sex with\".\nThis person was explained it wasn't the place they were looking for and they left.",

Kind of like when you walk past a kiosk at the mall and the salesperson grabs you while you were walking past them to a different store, telling you that \"you really want this product\" and won't take no for an answer. \n\nIt's good to always talk to your partners regarding nsfw stuff before you start. Be very clear that it is not an ERP or that things HAVE to start being Safe For Work until it's agreed upon that it is okay to start the NSFW language and themes. If they break that rule or protest, don't let them pressure you. It might suck to have one less potential partner, but chances are things would have only gotten worse for you.\n\nThis is why setting clear boundaries ahead of time are so important and recognizing the red flags.\n\nOnce the person suggested to completely change the lore like that, not just a couple little tweaks, but change everything, that was your first sign that the person was not going to cooperate.",
