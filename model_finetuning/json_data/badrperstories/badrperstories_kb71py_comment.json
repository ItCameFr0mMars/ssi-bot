It's not wrong for them to make the unilateral decision to move on. It's cool that you would endeavor to improve, but sometimes the change that needs to happen is really big and not realistic to expect you to do in the short term, or it's purely their preference, or they don't feel comfortable critiquing a partner's writing, or - some people who say they would prefer to know so they could improve actually end up arguing back at you and it gets nasty. I think a lot of experienced roleplayers would rather move on because it's a better use of their time to just find a situation that works off the bat than spend a lot of time and effort on a situation that might never improve.",

It was going awesome, we\u2019d posted a few times and we weren\u2019t even twenty four hours in when I get the message saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna focus on my other rp\u2019s chow\u201d.\n\nNow why answer to an ad if:\n\nA) you\u2019ve got no time for it?\n\nB) you\u2019ve got no interest in it?\n\nOr\n\nC) you\u2019re gonna up and leave without saying what was actually wrong.\n\nSeriously, when I asked why, I was just ignored. She\u2019d even answered the post and I was halfway through answering it before she messaged me.\n\nIt\u2019s annoying as fuck.\n\nWhat happened to you sounded like the R rated version of what happened to me.",

            "body": "If an RP partner's writing isn't doing it for me, I usually just politely end the RP. I have tried giving partners a chance to improve, but it's rarely that simple. It takes study and practice for someone to improve their writing skills. Until they've put in that effort, they aren't going to be able to fully understand what they're doing wrong even when it's pointed out to them. I remember trying to explain to one RP partner why their character, whose characterization was shallow and whose behavior was annoying and unrealistic, didn't have a prayer of winning my character's interest or respect. My partner promised to do better, but nothing changed. I don't think they were being intentionally stubborn or lazy. I just think they had no idea how to write a character with actual depth and complexity. So if improvement really is your aim, I wouldn't rely on your RP partners to tell you what you're doing wrong. I'd start reading books on writing instead and get some writing practice in outside of RP.\n\nHaving said all that, this guy definitely sounds like a tool. It's never fair to lie to a partner about whether you're enjoying an RP, and it feels especially unfair and uncalled for to block a partner without warning or explanation. His unwillingness to deal with any of the unpleasantness that might have arisen from being honest seems both cowardly and selfish. More selfish than cowardly, perhaps, since he was willing enough to insult you once you contacted him. You have every right to be angry and fed up.",
