I know that things like that can fly in a crack rp or another genre but the tone of our rp is more grounded and serious. \n\nI'm up for being flexible but not when it's already agreed upon that we will stick to the setting. The canon characters don't even exist in our rp so it's really more that we're using the setting and lore. If you're not going to read about the setting/genre/fandom/whatever you are rping in, then why rp there?\n\nAnyway, the bigger issue I have now is that they want to be secretive with their character when I've already given all there is to know about mine. \n\n*Of course, the Mesopotamia thing is just an analogy. We're not rping something like that",
