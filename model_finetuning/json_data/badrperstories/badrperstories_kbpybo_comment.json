Yes, it's true you don't owe anyone anything, but to use that as a way to treat people like dog shit is just toxic af.\n\nOn another note, something I hate even more about tumblr rp:\n\nThey police what people rp which is something that **really** makes my blood boil. If someone dares rp anything that they don't personally agree with, they will do everything in their power to spin a narrative on the person in order to 'cancel' them. What is the purpose of story telling and exciting plots if a person can only rp 'sunshine and rainbows' all the time? They also try to cancel people who play villain muses which I find completely ridiculous. These people really need to understand that muse does not equal mun.",

            "body": "The public nature of Tumblr RP just makes it way too performative, in my experience. Even a 1-on-1 RP on Tumblr can easily have outside observers, so there's no way to insulate yourself from popularity contests, cancel culture, ship wars, and general fandom toxicity. I have seen appalling things go down in various fandoms on Tumblr, so I'm not surprised that RPers get hit with similar problems, especially if they're RPing canon characters. It doesn't help that Tumblr is a terrible format for RP to begin with. It's way too easy to lose track of RP threads, which could contribute to at least some of the ghosting issues (ghosting is a huge issue in Reddit's RPC too, though).",

            "body": "You are absolutely RIGHT\n\nI still Tumblr RP on occasion, but only with one group that ignores the RPC culture (ya know, banning FCs, strict guidelines, etc), and occasional indie with my friends that actually vibe well.\n\nBut I have several incidents with the toxic RPC people, including them constantly trying to get me banned from a group for several dumb reasons and even starting a lot of drama that ended up getting the group shut down.\n\nOne notable incident was when they reported me to an admin (who was actually pretty cool, btw) over a headcanon for my own character. It wasn't even a toxic or triggering headcanon. Basically, my character's FC was Kat Graham and I just shared a headcanon in the Skype group chat (before we transitioned to discord), that her mother probably looked like Taraji P. Henson. It wasn't even official on her page and her mother wasn't included or mentioned in any of the storyline at all, I was just like 'these two actresses have similar features' and headcanoned that my character's mother looked like her.\n\nI got reported for 'racial erasure' because their races aren't the same, since Kat is mostly mixed with a bunch of different races I guess and Taraji is predominantly African American.\n\nAnother time was when I was changing my FC so I can have more diverse gifs that actually suit my character instead of using the same 5-10 over and over again. I was reported for switching from a Puerto Rican actress to a Mexican one. \n\nI was also reported for cultural appropriation for using the term spirit animal in the group chat.\n\nThe final straw that actually broke the group up was after we moved to Discord, one if my friends had her icon as Jughead from Riverdale. It was like that for weeks and no one commented on it.\n\nThen one of the RPC people came on after her couple week long hiatus and made a passive aggressive comment about how there should be a rule about people having 'triggering' icons. Literally no one knew what she was talking about and when we pressed her for what she meant, she finally said that because of some drama Cole Sprouse was apparently in, she wanted the rule to force my friend to change her icon. My friend wasn't even online to defend herself and this girl wanted to turn everyone against her over the icon and arguments ensued, people took sides, and the group ended that night.\n\nI remember it clearly because it was my 21st birthday and they definitely made me drink more than I planned lol.",
