Good villains (ones I like the most) cause physiological damage, break you down on the inside, changing the character. This will take time but it forces doubt and change to characters that will cause strife between each other and may lead to each other's demise. They may not be totally strong but they're cunning, seemingly are two- even ten steps ahead of people. I'm not against villain's offing characters but you can tell if they're getting desperate if they're sending other characters (telepathically) to corner them with no fighting chance.\n\nEv was looking down on my character the whole time but had to call up back up when she didn't do anything to him. All he's doing was spamming his magic, sitting on the throne acting like he's so powerful and hot shit. I expected more from a group of novella players but that proved to me that fancy words can't hide bad characterization. I just don't think horror rps fit me anyway, clash of ideals.",

First, there are creators like Ev, second is the \u201dmain cast\u201d who play different roles in the story and are most likely immune to death. The bottom is the victims aka the punching bags. \n\nThere weren't that many places to go to. It was either the palace or outside. This was done on purpose as you said so they can get cheap and easy kills. Ev is in the palace so there's no avoiding him unless characters stay outside and go inside when he's not \u201daround\u201d. In every area in the palace, you'll see past characters die. There were so many deaths that already occurred and most of the people who had their characters killed off left the group. Seeing how the villains are the main characters this means that every character created at some point will die or if you're a good guy you'll never get the upper hand because the plot revolves around Ev. Remove him and you end the the story, everyone wins. But the creators can't obviously allow that so that's why I said in my last post the villains are practically immune to death- which is not only a very sue/Gary Stu thing to do but it's unfair.",

Kill an npc? Steal stuff from them? Obstacle them? Beat them up unfairly and show them they are inferior but not actually killing them? Yep. All good things if backed up with reasons to do that. \nBut brag about unfair powers on a throne and metagame, not allowing anything go against plans is not fun and doesn't actually drive the good guys to fight the bad ones as they already know they can't win.\n\nIdk what component of that rp was survival horror, as the only way to survive is to bow down to the allmighty overlord Ev and hope they won't look bad at you.
