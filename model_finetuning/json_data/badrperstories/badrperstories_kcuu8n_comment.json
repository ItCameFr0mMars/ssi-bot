For example in mxm roleplays, many people just look for the standard dominant top character, who also has a sixpack, or the submissive beautiful twink. \n\nIf you add some other stuff to the first character, for example that he is only 5'3, that he is not that athletic or a coach potato, that he has a ton of freckles, or is not white, the chances that your character will not fit the 'my dominant prince charming'-fantasy of your writing partner will be higher. \n\nA lot of these people look for a very specific type, and if you want a love interest like Chris Hemsworth, you will be disappointed if someone wants to use Idris Elba as a face claim. Both are attractive, but one just does not fit their specific fantasy.\n\nWhen I still wrote romance, I once had the problem that my partner picked a fantasy faceclaim that I could not find attractive at all (not a non-white character, she was an elven maid who fit certain beauty standards, but the image was just so oversexualized), and it was really hard for me to imagine that my character would. And I think that this is a valid point. If you don't find your partner's character attractive at all, and the main focus of the roleplay is romance, it will just not be satisfying to write it for most people. Unfortunately, many people have very rigid views of what they or their characters would find attractive.\n\nTherefore, I am always upfront in my searches or if I apply to a search, and mention that I like to write non-white characters. If they are not open for this, at least I don't waste my time creating a character that I can't use anyway.",

Like where is the diversity? Where is the creativity?  \n\n\nEvery time I try to rp with someone, I of course would want to use someone in my diverse cast of characters- I have many of different races, genders, ages, even species- and just because my characters are \"different\" they are ALL ugly- and here's the thing- I DO make purposely ugly characters- but even if I do not decide to use those- I still have my other characters who are non-white get called ugly. Hell- even my \"attractive\", yet still non-white, characters get called ugly- and they aren't \"good enough\" for some people.  \n\n\nI only ever see people a part of the romance rping communities do this- they ALL claim \"looks don't matter\" but as soon as you raise them a non conventionally attractive character they change that and ghost/block you, and it's SO dumb. Like- seriously- It's been years and this continues to happen and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong  \n\n\nIt turns me off to romance rp in general. I rather not even do it at all anymore.",

It is more superficial. \n\nSometimes, people just have the thought 'wow, sleeping with someone who is uncut is my fantasy at the moment' and search only for people like that. Of course, this excludes many people, and sometimes, (in case of 'no Asians' for example) this can be hurtful if you read it. But it is also more honest, because if you are Asian, or chubby, or femme, you don't have to waste your time writing to this person whose preference you do not fit anyway. It is very tricky, in my opinion.\n\nA friend of mine who uses this app, and from what I've seen, most (normal) adds don't exclude based on race.\n\nIn the end, we have to keep in mind that society at large, at least in Western countries, the beauty standard is most accessible for white people, which is sad.

It is rarely seen as a big deal when your story is about to start and you are in the last details of \"BTW, that's what my character will look like\".  At least in my experience.\n\nBut I did have a few instances of people wanting the skin color of their character to be a central point of the story, even in a fantasy or sci-fi settings, and with no regard with the rest of the story.  For example \"Ok, so we are two thieves trying to escape a bunch of necromancers who want to kill us because we stole something from them.  On the side, our characters could develop a bit of feelings for each other.\"  and get the reply \"That sounds great! Also, i would like to have the tension between them because he's black be a central point of the story\".  That's when i tend to nope out.  It's a fantasy setting, with tons of different races, monsters trying to kill us, etc, and they want the focus put on his skin color?  Really?",
