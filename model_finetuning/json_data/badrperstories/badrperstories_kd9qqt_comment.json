The underage members should not have to state their age unless circumstances warrant it - safety and whatnot.\n\nSeeing as you have no ERP in this server everything should run smoothly, it will be up to you to weed out any people who try to abuse this system and adjust it accordingly. I believe in you, and good luck!",

            "body": "*Yknow, all adults were teens at one point.* I'm not sure how I feel about this question but what I can say is that just like how teens can make adult characters, adults can make teen characters. Some people make characters that are close to their age because they feel a similarity to the character. It was the same for me when I was younger roleplaying. Most of my characters were 15~17. As I grew older, the age range did and now my characters are 18~24 but I started making more characters who were 30+. Should I stop/discard playing my minor/underage characters because I am an adult now? No, cause at the end of the day that\u2019s my character. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s really a \u201cgeneral consensus\u201d. Idk don\u2019t sexualize/fetishize them? But teens also do that and to older characters so you gotta take that into account.\n\nImo as long as everyone respects the rules that you put in place then all should go well. Just be on the lookout for people who do or say things to others that make them uncomfortable ooc.",

By the time I was 16, I had friends who were 18 and over, and it felt natural to share some social spaces with adults as long as they were mindful of my age. This was definitely not the case when I was 13. (In fact I remember running to my mom at that age when an adult man ended up in one of my teen RP chatrooms by mistake. In his defense, the name of the chatroom was \"Fantasy Ride.\" It was about horses. He thought it was about something else entirely. My mom got rid of him in hilarious fashion.)
