            "body": "Hm, I think that this happens because they see your character's personality as more 'solid'. With a new character, people might assume that they could be a good person, deep down. When you have shown them time and time again that yes, your character is just a power-hungry asshole, they are less likely to question that or think that he might have ulterior motives, and who can blame them?\n\nFor them, it is not just one stupid thing that your character said. It is a stupid thing in a series of stupid/cruel things he has said and done, and it is natural that they will assume the worst of your character, where they might give another character the benefit of the doubt. It is just natural. In fact, if someone would always say 'Guys, let's listen to this dude who is always an asshole, maybe this time, he is just misunderstood and lonely!' I would wonder who naive that character is.\n\nI really don't think that this is hypocrisy. Also, your characters did not say the same thing. Saying someone deserved to die because they were weak and unfit to serve seems heartless and uncalled for. There is really not much room for interpretation here, and if your character is always an asshole, there will be no one who thinks 'Well, maybe he has good reasons, let's listen to him'. When someone says 'These soldiers died because they were selfish and attention seeking', that is not better. \n\nBut I can understand that some people might think 'Wait, how did he come to this conclusion? Did he know something about this soldiers that we didn't/has he lost someone in the war and is now angry and hurt because he feels like that person left him alone, and he perceives this  as them being selfish because they left him?' I can get why someone says 'Let's hear his reasoning for thinking that way.' especially if the other characters don't know much about this person.\n\nAlso, the view on character's that take revenge differs from the view on characters who are just asshole's for reason. Saying stuff like 'Your parents never loved you.' for example is always an asshole move, but saying that to someone who has insulted you themself and bullied your friends (don't know what your character did exactly) is seen as justified. Even if the second character takes it a little bit to far, a lot of people will think 'It's rude, but he kind of deserved it, look what he did to the other characters' and it will not taint that character's reputation so much.",

            "body": "I completely understand. I know what he said was heartless and cruel hearted. I know  that for sure. And I recognize where people would be unwilling to see it his way.\n\nI was more or so upset because their characters who said something like selfish and attention seeking was seen as appropriate and worthwhile to listen to. It just seemed like a double standard to me.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand how my roguish character was getting lambasted and hated on, while their character, who also said awful things during that statement, was seen as someone to listen to and even feel sorry for.\n\nI thought the point was that these soldiers lost their lives, and neither of them should so callously and selfishly decide how and why they died. In my mind, they should both get the same treatment since they both said unsavory and cruel things, when they weren\u2019t in the position of the soldiers who fought for the cause.\n\nAgain, I do understand what you\u2019re saying. I just don\u2019t understand why their character is getting all this praise, when they\u2019re also selfishly and cruelly stating the actions and the willpower of those guys were nothing more than \u201cselfish\u201d \u201cattention seeking\u201d bastards.\n\nIn my eyes, they\u2019re both horrendously cruel, and I would love it more if their cruel ness was delved into so they could change somehow, and become better people.\n\nMaybe saying hypocrisy wasn\u2019t the best word, and I do apologize for that as well. I guess I\u2019m just really upset and I feel that this is kinda weird for my oc to go through, but I do see what you\u2019re saying.",

            "body": "The rational response would probably treating both the same. But the emotional response is being more annoyed/ enraged with a character that has always been an asshole. \nIn my opinion, it is a bit weird if everyone responds in a positive way to your partner's character, but a bit more understanding reactions are to be expected in a situation like that. \n\nI personally enjoy writing evil/asshole character, so here is some advise: redemption arcs are incredibly hard to write. I know that redemptions arcs are rewarding. But the writing process can be frustrating. \nOften, you think 'Now I will include a little something that could make the other character's realize that my character has this terrible event that happened in his past, and that this is one of the reasons that he is so cold.\" but your fellow writers either don't get that detail or your character has already done so much shit that it is hard for them to be empathetic. \nSometimes, you want to write scenes were your character tries to be a better man, but everyone assumes that he just does it for attention or that this is a trick to get them to trust him, only so that he can exploit \nthem later on.\nThis can be very frustrating. I know that it would be more appreciated if the cruelness of the character could be explored, or if people would inspire him to change himself. But in a way, forgiveness as a gift, not something that has to happen as time goes by, no matter how much your character will change. Some things are hard to forgive, and not everyone has to give every asshole they met a change to prove themself. \nA redemption arc should be about your character realizing something about himself, not about everyone else learning that he is a good guy, because that is a reaction that can't be forced..",
