Especially when it becomes an excuse to force another character to coddle them 24/7.\n\nBuddy, if your character is so anxious they cannot function and can\u2019t pour themself a cup of water without panicking, they need help. It\u2019s not cute, no matter how child-like you make them. \n\nI know how bad anxiety can feel. It should not be fetishized, especially when the \u201ccute/quirky\u201d part is the character is \u201cbroken\u201d, completely dependent on others, and can\u2019t get better. All while infantilizing them, of course. This goes for every mental illness tbh. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re probably going to make things not fun for other people. One of my first RP partners had a character who would self harm and have panic attacks if my OC didn\u2019t do what the writer wanted. The plot was basically gone: my character had to be their caretaker and completely sacrifice his own health and goals. It was stressful: I basically had to walk on eggshells to prevent a tragedy.",

As someone who has been stabbed, that's not what it's like lol.\n\nYour whole body will go cold except for the site of the injury, which will feel almost unbearably hot as blood rushes to that point to repair the damage. You won't feel the blade so much itself, unless you move a lot. It's like a really sharp, bad cramp. \n\nYou'll also probably start shaking from adrenaline as your fight or flight kicks in (if not already), and you'll not feel as much pain until later when you've calmed down and had time to process what's happened.\n\nLater, after the wound has healed, it will ache and possibly be numb in places depending on the damage done. I never see people write about old injuries affecting strength, comfort or range of motion.\n\nThat was longer than I thought it was gonna be, my bad.\n\nEdit: fixed a word",

When I was in my sophomore year, I tried tech-theater and instantly I was shipped with the only other gay guy in the production. I'm a bro-y guy and so when I met him I gave a pat on the back to be friendly. Oh if I only knew the crime I committed. Unbeknownst to me, some shipper friends of his had convinced him that we should date. We had just met. Every day it would play out the same, he'd go in for a hug, I'd give a pat during said hug. Until on evening, he almost broke down crying and suddenly I was the center of hate because I wouldn't reciprocate affection from someone I hadn't known a month. I left rather then deal with the BS. \n\nAll too often, what I call shippers will force their fantasized view of how gay relationships work on to those around them. Honestly, homophobia isn't an issue in my every life but these people are. Hell I love comic books but I can't even enjoy the fandom now because the authors are are pandering to these people. I wish the MCU was never made so I could just enjoy my strong men in tights. Anyway, that's my rant as crappy as it is.",
