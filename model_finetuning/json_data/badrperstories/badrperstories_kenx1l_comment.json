            "body": "I can only relay my personal experiences, but I'm currently in an RP involving several non-binary characters (one of whom uses they/them pronouns and non-gendered terms of address). I'm a literate roleplayer with a decent grasp of English.\n\nEnglish does not make this process simple, by any stretch of the imagination. Sometimes, I will sit there re-writing a sentence three times over because otherwise, it doesn't make sense. Occasionally, MS Word (which I where I type my posts) will just refuse to accept that I mean \"they\" and not \"he\", or the forsaken application will decide that all my verbs are wrong because \"they\" is plural as far as it's concerned. Or it will be like \"you used person seven times, are you sure you don't want to diversify\". Gah!\n\nIt's maddening.\n\nAnd I want to get it right because these characters mean a lot to me and the roleplay in general (and one of them is my character, so you know, I really, really want to make sure) but, man, English just... frustrates me. \n\nI know other languages are even worse (looking at you, French)!\n\nI guess my point is that some people are in fact transphobic assholes, and if you're dealing with those, I am so, so sorry. May their socks always be wet and may they always get papercuts between their fingers. \n\nBut if you're dealing with someone with a poor grasp of English who relies on autocorrect, they may be struggling with other things (and it may be worth talking about).",

            "body": "Dude I have no idea why people have to be so straight up transphobic and nasty when it comes to rping. Like seriously- the amount of times I've run into people who have been transphobic or say rude things about my trans characters is literally ridiculous- and as a person a part of the LGBTQ+ community myself- I can't help but to take those personally? Like- how do people think it's okay to say these kinds of things to people? Behind a screen or not?  \n\n\nI get people having \"preferences\", that's what a TON of people say in order to justify not wanting to rp with trans characters- but is it really \"preference\" most of the time? I get if someone is nice about it- then I'd feel less upset over it- but i've literally had people call my trans character \"it\" before- dead serious- they called my character who is trans and I have such a connection to \"it\", and \"not a real man\", and that is terrible? Like seriously- and they even said they thought he was disgusting and got mad at ME for wasting THEIR time even though they literally responded to MY ad-  \n\n\nand I've had other people like.... I guess not take my explanations for certain characters when I take an effort to tell them who they are and what their identities are- I had a humanoid alien character who came from a planet with no concept of gender, so they used they/them pronouns on earth- and I've explained this to my partner and they said \"okay that's fine\", but in the rp they... for some reason strongly believed my character was... multiple people? literally instead of her character saying \"do you want\" she would say \"do you guys want\" like- wh-? What? I dunno if that was based in transphobia- (I had bigger issues with this rper later on that aren't related to this whole weird situation), but it was still odd?  \n\n\nBut then on the other side of the spectrum- I've had people fetishize my trans characters which feels even MORE gross- like... where are all the rpers who treat your trans characters like actual human beings? Not freaks? Or objects? Honestly- the people who do treat them nicely- thank you- thank you for being cool with who my characters are  \n\n\nI will never agree to changing my characters' trans identities just because some rper doesn't like it-   \n\n\nI am proud of my characters and who they are- I don't want to do anything to change them",

            "body": "Dude, I'm sorry you're dealing with this shit. \n\nLike, I do understand misgendering people by accident in speech. I have a trans sister and an enby best friend. When my trans sister came out, I definitely struggled to say her correct pronouns for a while. I've had an even harder time getting my enby friend's they/them pronouns correct consistently in speech. I'm assuming that's just because I haven't used they/them to refer to individuals much in the past, so it's newer territory. I'm working diligently to get it right, but when you've known someone by one set of pronouns for a long time, there's going to be some lag time before using their new pronouns becomes habitual. \n\nBut that's actual speech. There's no backspacing when you're talking out loud. You can't pause to \"read\" what you're going to say before speaking, at least not if you want to keep up with the flow of a real-time conversation. But it's different when you're typing. You have time to make corrections. So if you're messing up over, and over, and over via text, that's not an innocent mistake. That's willful. Especially when you're misgendering a person or character who was literally introduced to you with their correct pronouns. There's no awkward transition in that case, so using the right pronouns should be easy.\n\nMy guess is that a lot of people who want to virtue signal and call themselves allies haven't really thought about what it means to be trans and/or enby at all. So as soon as their allyship is tested, it falls apart.",
