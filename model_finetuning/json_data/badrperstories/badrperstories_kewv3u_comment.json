Yeah people worry about ghosting too much, but a lack of common courtesy isn't justifiable either, if you aren't interested just man up and say \"sorry not interested\" and if they act childish just block them. its as easy as that and goes a long way in preserving potential RP partners. i'm a lot more interested in attempting an RP with someone who outright told me that they weren't feeling an RP than someone who just never responded again because they \"didn't owe me anything\"",

Most of the people here however (or at least most people that I've spoken to) don't harass their partner every day. For me personally, I send a message once it's been 3 days, because by that point, I'm starting to lose interest, especially if I haven't gotten any contact ooc.  \n\n\nNo internet stranger owes me anything? Hard disagree. A stranger owes me the courtesy with which they would treat anyone they've been having a conversation with. If I'm talking to a stranger on and off for a few days and then they walk away mid-conversation- yeah, it's really rude. I think we all owe eachother the respect we want to be treated with. I'm not owed a lengthy, personal explanation and sob stories and apologies- no. But a simple 'hey, sorry, I'm not feeling this anymore' *is* owed because I'm still a person behind this screen.",

Because I thought I found a solid partner in the community, with ideas we both like, but obviously that isn't the case. And it gives you no cues on what you could've done better next time, to avoid the same thing. It's a shitty experience. At this point, ghosters that I knew I probably wouldn't hit it off with don't matter. The people that act friendly and positive, or waste my time writing tons of ideas and starters only to ghost annoy me. I would honestly prefer a mutual goodbye and let that be that.",

It's great that you don't ghost or that you haven't experienced this, but I don't think that should diminish the experience of people who have faced this, and do so frequently. You telling them to look at their own behaviour can be a bit frustrating because sometimes, even if you do everything right, don't bother someone, gently ask for an update, and wait patiently- ghosts still happen.",
