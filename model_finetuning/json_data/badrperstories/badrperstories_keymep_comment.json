Not to say I've had \"conflict of interest\" before, necessarily, but I do have a co-leader in a group that's missing and the world belongs to her so any changes we make have to be done carefully. Either way, I guess this bother sme because I, myself, am an enthusiastic world builder--so much so, i think I get carried away, but I'm a believer that if you want the world to feel real you need to fill in the gaps between lore chunks.\n\nI adore well done lore and detailed world building, and it's my biggest grievance when I enter a group or species chat and discover it's all \"UwU aesthetic\" or \"lol i don't care\", maybe bare bones if I'm lucky. Or heaven forbid it's there but locked behind a \"the owner has it, it's just not published yet\" wall. Do people have a problem with world building? Honestly. I'd rather have people coming in and trying to break the established rules instead of float around in an empty void for eternity.\n\nI could totally get if this person didn't know how to progress, sometimes you have a couple spires of thought you want built but no way to make bridges to connect them; I get if you only had one specific area completed and didn't consider going beyond the borders you established. But they can't have an empty skeleton, ACCEPT the offer to co-create, and then FAIL TO COMMUNICATE anything about what they want.\n\nHonestly, I'd pack up and wish them well if you haven't already; it's obvious they don't actually know what they want or expect you to read their mind for content, and that's a struggle you don't need for something like that.If they can't communicate details or even offer leads to follow, who even knows if they'd credit you for what you DID accomplish? Hell, maybe they're farming you for ideas and using them elsewhere!\n\nTime to mosey on, partner.",

I had someone like this when creating a rp server lore. I asked people to brainstorm some ideas, they become clueless. Then I put my ideas in and the flood gates open with changes. Someone wanted to add guns into the rp I say \u201calright how will we balance it?\u201d, they say \u201cIdk\u201d. Imagine having the audacity to shoot down people\u2019s ideas and want to add ideas that they push onto to others that needs to be regulated. Suddenly this modern fantasy turned into a sifi story as now they wanted to change the year to 2300 with advanced technology. The story was becoming a mess so I just left. They can have their sifi story. \n\nI bet you my college loans that they haven\u2019t even opened up the server. Op you\u2019re better off leaving and writing off your own lore/story and inviting people to it who are genuinely interested in your story.",
