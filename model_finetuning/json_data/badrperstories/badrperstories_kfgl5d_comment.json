For example, when we today say that people in medieval Italy spoke \"Italian\", we mean that they spoke a family of languages that mostly stemmed from the same root (mostly Latin), but in practice would have big vocabulary and grammatical differences, as well as loan words from other languages to which any particular dialects were geographically close. That was one of the reasons that Latin (a dead language accessible only to the literate) was the lingua franca in medieval Europe - people speaking different native dialects would have trouble communicating to each other. Proliferation of a standardized language over large areas only became common in the modern era. Some countries, like Russia, attempted it earlier with the help of genocide and forced reeducation, because getting people to rely on a language that is completely foreign to them and not used in their local area is actually a really difficult task.",

The characters ICly opened a restaurant in the kingdom setting we were all situated in. The chef was mute and had to communicate through either sign language or writing in a notepad to communicate. The gf could speak.\n\nThey still understood the common tongue and weren't speaking some foreign tongue. Receiving the information wasn't the problem, but then they had to be creative with how they communicated back to other characters.\n\nSadly, as creative and fun as this possibility was, the pair ragequit out of the setting because of some IC issue. But regardless the point stands, respect the lore and find other ways to be \"special\" and more importantly just **interesting.**",

Every time we get an influx of new people, at least half of them ask if they can use a race/species that isn't listed on what exists in the world.   \nIt's a cyberpunk genre RP, that has fantasy elements. It's basically Underworld meets cyberpunk, with street level type crime. We've got humans, vampires, werewolves, werebears(although they are endangered so the number we allow is limited), elves, orcs, and dwarves. The latter 3 are more or less humans who just looks different, for reasons covered in the lore. So, we have a good amount of options for people. Yet people always ask 'can I have a character that isn't a race listed?' and it's just frustrating, and they almost always want to argue about it.  \n\n\nJust today we had someone try to argue that their LGBTQ+ character was discriminated against, IC, but that isn't a thing in our server. The RP takes place in 2177, and we decided it'd be ideal if sexuality and such \\*wasn't\\* a controversial thing by then. They tried to argue that it's their view that it could still be an issue in some circles, despite us telling them, repeatedly, that it isn't a thing at this point in time in our lore.",
