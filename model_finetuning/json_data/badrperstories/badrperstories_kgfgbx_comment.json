You may want to do something with your character, but your partner decides to do something or react in a way that gets in the way of your plans, but that's okay. That's why roleplay is fun on the first place. And that this means it's totally normal for those things to happen. You should also remember that your cousin is a person and can't read minds: if you don't tell her, she might not know.\nIn these cases, it's better to tell the others the plans you have if they are necessary or something you really want to do.",
