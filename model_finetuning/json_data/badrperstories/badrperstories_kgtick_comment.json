            "body": "I dunno.  Kind of feel you are making a mountain out of a molehill. The guy asked if you were there. That isn't necessarily him harassing you to post already. That is your interpretation. You did say you'd be back after some errands. Now, I personally wouldn't do what he did. However, I've had times where people would promise to 'be around to RP in a bit.' And it then not happening. Which is fine. Something could have come up. But, if I feel I've agreed to RP later in the day with a partner I do commit to it. I try to ensure I'll be available. And when after hours I still didn't hear anything, yes. I'd wonder if perhaps it isn't going to happen so I can make other plans and commitments. That could be the intent behind his question. Just to get an idea of the situation. \n\nAlso reading some of the replies here and I'm wondering. If him inserting the drama with his character being asked if yours was his mother wasn't such a big deal then why even rant about it now? It kind of feels like you're nitpicking now about anything you can find you did not like about this guy because you're mad/offended. \n\nAs others said too. Sometimes it is difficult to tell if you're gonna mesh yet. I'd rather give an RP a serious shot before I decide to quit as well. Don't think he did anything wrong there.\n\nIt feels to me you're mainly upset about the fact he did not seem happy with your writing and you feel it is unfair because you were willing to 'look past' the things you did not like in his writing. Yet he did not do the same in return. That, because he himself writes 'like that' he has no right to feel 'better' and come out and say you don't mesh. I dunno. I could be wrong. And I've seen you around this sub and I've always felt you're a kind reasonable person. But I dunno. \n\nI get how you feel to a degree but I'm sorry. Your opinion on this really doesn't feel fair nor rational to me. \n\nThe guy didn't even ghost you. I could also say it was inconsiderate of you not to try and see things from his angle when he asked if you were there and actively choosing to ignore a partner who might have merely been wondering if you were back yet for reasons I've explained. It really doesn't seem such a big deal to get pissed over. I'd personally would have sent a message when I'd be back and ready to RP in OOC if a partner asked me that, because I did make a commitment myseld and I'd feel it's courteous to keep them posted when it seems they're committed to sit down to RP with me as we've agreed on, as well.\n\nLastly, as others have said too. If you don't like something a partner does whether that is IC or OOC it's definitely on you to communicate about it.\n\nFrom what I see, you never communicated at all about what bothered you. Hence not even giving this guy a fair chance to realize and/or fix it. He might have been very willing. It could very well be your passive aggressive silence that made him feel you two did not mesh. \n\nPlease. I really think you're nice in general from what I can see. But please do some reflecting on this and try to be open about the idea that you could be wrong here. It'll only help you in the end.",
