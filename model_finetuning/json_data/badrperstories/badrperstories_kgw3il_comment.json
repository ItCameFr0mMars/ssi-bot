I had to wait a week before I could place another post.\n\nOk, fine. I posted a week later with a different ad. This time it was for a SFW RP. The story went something like this: you find an injured stray cat, nurse her back to health and decide to adopt her. Then you find out the cat has special powers. The same mod immediately took down my post, saying I wasn\u2019t allowed to RP as a cat. I reread the rules and it didn\u2019t say anything about not being able to RP as an animal.  I commented that on my thread and then I find out I\u2019m banned from the subreddit. \n\nAnother time I joined a RP Discord server and posted the same ad about the cat RP. One of the mods said my story was stupid and no one would want to RP with a cat. \n\nYeah, some mods are just jerks for no reason.",

            "body": "There's a big disconnect between players and mods.\n\nHaving been on both sides, I know that sometimes things get lost in translation.\n\nWith my main server, I have had a lot of players that eventually come to me and say \"man, I used to think you hated me,\" because we're doing this all through text so me being clear with corrections comes off as angry when it's not. I do think there are some mods out there who could maybe learn to be a little easier on players. For me, if I need to remove a post, it's because it's in an active scene where there's a lore break and I know the player has gone offline - but in that case, I *always* copy and paste to send the post to them in their DMs because I know players work hard on what they make. If it's not an active scene and there's no real rush, I'll tag the scene under their post with a \"scene paused for corrections\" until it can be fixed.\n\nWith a sub that I help mod, all posts have to be approved. They're technically live until we do, but we do need to approve all of them. Most commonly, people post ads without links, which it says we need in our rules because we want to be able to verify that all the ads are appropriately categorized. We always give a reason. As soon as someone adds the relevant information, all they need to do is tell us and then we'll approve it, and it'll be live again.\n\nThat all said, roleplaying is writing which is an art which is dependent upon inspiration and passion. Most of us understand that. In knowing that, we know that players are often not paying attention to the bigger picture. A lot of them just see corrections and requests for edits as attacks. They read something like \"you need to edit this to add this\" as \"YOU NEED TO DO THIS IMMEDIATELY AND ALSO FUCK YOU FOR NOT KNOWING THAT\" when that's literally nowhere near what was said. You're by far not the first or only person to ever internalize these things. It's actually very common for individual players to automatically take everything as criticism and hostility, even when there's none of that being given on the Mod's end.\n\nHell, even I do that sometimes, and I'm a Mod myself. Mods should definitely understand that because they're in a position of authority, a lot of times their tones will be misconstrued as angry orders being issued rather than friendly reminders that a rule has been broken. But at the same time, individual players should also understand that corrections are just corrections and they're not attacks. Sometimes we're just busy, so instead of wasting time on small talk or beating around the bush, it's just a correction of \"this is what was posted, this is what you need to fix. This post was removed because it broke this rule.\" It's not ideal, but when you're dealing with anywhere from 30 to a few hundred players per day, sometimes there's nothing for it.",

Some don't step down because of power tripping and others don't because their group is some sort of passion project. Not that it makes it right to treat people shitty if you're burnt out though. \n\nBut I can also see from some points of view where taking a no nonsense approach and having strict rule enforcement is just the consequence of years of having to deal with trolling and sealioning that was invited in due to lax rules and being too open to discuss and accommodate RPers. Not talking about a sub here, but an RP group that I witnessed just get constantly plagued with shit from people trying to abuse openness and whose strict rules often get interpreted as mods stifling creative freedom and being mean. \n\nRP sub mods though, most are just power tripping and don't have enough mods on their teams.",
