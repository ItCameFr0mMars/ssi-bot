I love writing at least a couple paragraphs and worldbuilding, but recently had to end an rp because we clashed. Personally, I felt they were far too elitist and nitpicking. If I wanted to control a scene, then I was rushing it and taking over. So I let them control the rp and then they say I wasn't being inventive enough.   \n\n\nSo yes, compromise is key to not be 'elitist' and come across as a 'I'm a better rper than you' attitude. But at the same time, having a few set standards is absolutely fine. Wanting a few paragraphs and a faceclaim is fine. I'd say go to the advanced literate subreddit- you're bound to get more people along your train of thinking there.",

It's better for both me and my partner if we can call things off and both go find people we mesh with better. Sticking around for something you don't really want to do isn't going to benefit anyone in the long run. \n\nYour expectations aren't too high - but if you're consistently finding that your expectations don't match your partner's, it might be worth looking into where the miscommunication happened. There's nothing wrong in having set expectations and not wanting to settle for something that doesn't meet them. But it's definitely easier on everyone involved to have all those expectations mentioned up front. \n\nIt does sound like you might be able to 'vet' people better if you state you're looking for a minimum average post length (x words, y paragraphs, etc) and ask for writing samples before you plot too much. You can also link some writing samples of your own, I know I've clicked out of several requests because I've seen samples and realized my writing style doesn't match the other person's.",

In many cases, I'll put in a solid effort to make things work before I take that step, but sometimes it's clear from the beginning that I'm not going to mesh well with my partner, or with their writing style. Either way, I try to remind myself that ending an RP I'm not enjoying is the respectful thing to do. It's better than ghosting, of course, but it's also better than progressively losing my interest in the RP to the point that my partner can tell that I'm half-assing my posts. That's just a waste of time for both of us.\n\nPersonally, I don't consider your expectations too high at all. RP is supposed to be fun. There's literally no reason to engage in it if you're not enjoying it. So you should set your expectations high enough to ensure that you at least have a shot at having fun. \n\nTo be honest, I think the term 'elitist' gets thrown around a little more than it should in RP circles. This is a highly subjective hobby. Some people are going to have a lot of fun RPing in 1-line posts, while others prefer RPing in multiple paragraphs. Some people care a lot about spelling, grammar, and writing style, while others barely notice these things. Some people adhere to the traditional rules of RP (regarding godmodding and the like), while other people don't seem to care much about them. Finding your specific comfort level doesn't make you elitist. Everyone else is doing the same thing. So anyone who tries to make you feel bad for wanting to find like-minded RPers is being unreasonable.\n\nGood luck out there. I know it's tough finding the perfect match.",

Sure, it can be disappointing for that person to lose a writing partner, but if it's not fair to both parties, it's not really worth it. You're not setting the bar too high, people just like different things. However, it might be worth looking for a different place to put your ad. I imagine there's subreddits and other resources dedicated specifically to finding partners for lengthier roleplay (a google search revealed /r/AdvancedLiterateRP for example). You might just be searching in a place that's generally geared toward finding roleplays of shorter length, and need to find a different community to search in.",
