But, what is it with this recurring theme of people not being able to take no for an answer? \n\nI'm uniquely situated to have more free time than most and I give people what I feel is a fair amount a leeway.

It baffles me that someone would answer an ad they hadn't read all the way through, much less then try to *argue with the requester* to try to rope them into something they've repeatedly said they wouldn't like. \n\nReading about her dumping her life story on you made me cringe - I had a similar experience to that, about two years ago now I think. Someone answered my buddy request trying to recruit me to their group, and I declined, saying I had a personal dislike of the fandom. She then dumped a full screen's worth of text wall into my DMs, detailing a laundry list of personal issues and trauma that she claimed she'd only survived because she had the fandom to lean on. We'd known each other all of fifteen minutes and she's telling me about how she's been abused and assaulted and suicidal... One of my biggest Yikes moments since I started roleplaying. \n\nI hope you have better luck with people answering your ads in the future! It seems like finding active longterm partners is a massive uphill climb, but they're out there. Even when one person doesn't work out, there are, fortunately, plenty of fish in the sea. And plenty of trash, as evidenced by this subreddit. Hopefully you'll find someone soon!",

I'm a slower rper ( couple times a week) but I credit it to my replies being novella and me splitting my time between a good amount of rps, but i always give notice to people before we plot that I'm slower so they can have time to turn it down. I would never guilt someone and I'm upfront when I'm drained or busy but I also think some people get too angry when someone is like \" I have a life/kids/ a job\". I've heard a lot of people talk about partners being really unreasonable for having lives outside things and that's bad too. \n\nI mean if you do short replies it's probably easier to do them faster but sometimes you wanna do other things like watch a movie or play a game or spend time with your SO/family or kids too. Roleplay is a hobby not a job and I'm not saying you do this ( I can't cause i don't know you so please don't take offense) but there are also people who ONLY rp and can be very demanding in wanting all of someone's time. Hell I've even seen people talk about partners getting jealous when you have other rps than them.",

Like I understand some people obviously got spouses and kids and everything, but if someone is that busy and allegedly chronically ill, along with allegedly having a chronically ill kid, then perhaps roleplaying isn't the hobby for them and they shouldn't make someone feel bad for declining the offer to roleplay just because of their situation, or call them inflexible when I even offered to roleplay with them at a later date when they would have less on their plates. Like if you have time to watch a film or play a game or whatever, then you theoretically have time to crank out a response at least once a week in order to keep the momentum of the roleplay.

            "body": "Honestly I find RP ads are kind of like dating profiles, only about 1% of your responders will actually read the whole damn thing.  Unfortunately you also get folks turning into clingy/crazy people over good rp the same you do with dating.  Basically the drama is similar and VERY real more often than we'd like.  I basically have a hard rule of \"no rl relationships with rp partners\" for this very reason, some folks do NOT respect the line and blur lines.  It honestly feels like that may have been what was happening (or at least at risk of happening) here.  I think you dodged a bullet.\n\nI mean, I don't think I could keep up w/ your rp schedule either, but then I wouldn't have responded to the ad because that's not fair to you or myself.  And I think we all know how bad it sucks to get a character invested into a plot and bonds of friendship (and otherwise) only to have things fizzle out or die completely.  You know what you need to keep that alive, which is awesome.  Even more awesome that you're willing to stick with that and not compromise.  \n\nIt sounds like you very clearly voiced your needs and they didn't listen.  Consider it a holiday gift from the gods that you realized early on.",
