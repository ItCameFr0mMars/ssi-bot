            "body": "I would politely end the RP if I were you, even though I know doing so is as hard for you as it is for me. If your partner is taking control of your characters, they are godmodding. Doesn't matter whether they're trying to control your main character or a side character. Both would be considered against the fundamental rules of RP by nearly everyone I've ever RPed with. I was surprised recently to hear from one partner that she is used to sharing side characters. That's never been the norm in any of my prior RP circles, and I've been RPing on various platforms and in various formats for 23 years. So if someone wants to RP that way, I think they ought to bring it up before the RP starts to give their partner a chance to decide if they're okay with it. Personally, I wouldn't be. My side characters have personalities and backstories of their own, and I want to be able to play them myself.",

I have one partner where it's a story with a ton of characters- there's a few sides we share, then if we really like a side character we introduced, we don't share.
