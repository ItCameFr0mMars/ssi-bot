Literally it was just about roleplaying/character creation/world-building and nobody wanted to know what state/country you're from or what you're studying, it was a grand time. \n\nFast-forward to now and I know exactly what you're talking about. With some people I feel highly comfortable sharing details about myself. For example, I have a partner now with whom I bonded over ooc about curly hair girl struggles and so we shared pictures of ourselves with one another. She is a great partner and isn't invasive, just like I am not invasive towards her. This rarely happens though; on average I would prefer to even be genderless at this point as far as roleplaying goes lmao. I think a lot of people misconstrue roleplaying with right-off-the-bat friendship because of the cooperative nature of it and because of the relations our characters may share in roleplay. So the lines blur for them and they just assume that we're all of a sudden supposed to be besties because our characters are. \n\nThis, of course, doesn't account for those people that want details right off the bat. I've had to cease communications with people who came in from the jump wanting to just discuss our personal lives ooc instead of doing any sort of plotting for the roleplay....you know, what we initially connected for lol. I think some people are just lonely and taking it out in the wrong place via the wrong outlet.",

Some are clearly in it just for sex but I've found those easy enough most of the time to cull in the interview process. Most of those interested in it aren't going to make the effort needed for my main girls. I actually find having them injured (or in the case of one girl ready to castrate them with a spork) requires time and effort to overcome and those wanting just sex often don't have. The desire for 'just smut' and lack of patience for waiting seem to be proportional. I enjoy smut with my rp, but I want to know they have a drive for story and have it be the main focus. I've actually had a great experience with men as partners and found many want the same thing.",

            "body": "This is something I've noticed as well. Recently I've had several potential partners pass early on because I won't hand out personal information. It seems like a requirement of a lot of play right now to get started. This is so contrary to \"back in the day\" that I've had a hard time understanding what exactly it is that my partners are asking for. A good many lot of people will quickly block you after telling you how creepy refusing to give out all your private information apparently is. I'm a man, but I still have reasons to be concerned about invasions of privacy and stalkers. Never stops being strange to me that its usually a woman demanding we abandon this basic tenant of prudent internet safety.   \n\n\nWhat really boggles my mind is that this is is an immediate decision. I'm not very ooc chatty, I'll admit, but over time with a partner I like, I'll eventually loosen up just like anyone. Partners I've had for years or months *of course* know more about me because I also know a little about them and our experience working together has helped convince they are stable, reasonable people. We know each others names and professions as well as the general area we live in and the kinds of personal facts in general you'd share with a friend. They know my personal email with my real name and photo, and I don't worry that this will be misused in any way.   \n\n\nBut someone I met (effectively) five minutes ago that is *already* trying to pull a game of emotional blackmail to get my details? Not so much. I assume this is some sort of verification test? (Just my guess.) But this isn't Tinder and I am not looking for a personal collection. \n\nPart of the reason I am less than chatty is because I *actually* want to write, and there's a direct proportion to how much ooc chatter is taking place and how much writing there is not. It's hard enough to find time to post without adding in relationship maintenance. Besides that, I don't want a fuzzy line being established between myself and my character. The more I talk about myself, the more indistinct the separation tends to become.\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't sometimes have conversation with my established partners; I do. If the partner in question does accept some basic distance, I'll suddenly start to get spoken to like a special needs puppy. Everything gets pre-loaded with \".. if this doesn't make you too uncomfortable.\" Really? I'm not delicate. I'm just trying to enjoy my hobby without overshares.",
