            "body": "If professional help won't work, maybe it's time to find a support group, one comprised of people who gather together specifically to help each other out. \n\nThe point is to seek out those who you know are expecting and are prepared to help. They are knowingly ready to take on that challenge, as opposed to an RP partner who is potentially a random near stranger and unprepared to take on that kind of emotional labor. It might even be triggering for them. \n\nI have had people suddenly unload on me about their very recent relapse into self harm or tell me out of the blue how suicidal they are. My only response was panic without having any kind of clue how to help them, and I was only left with severe guilt when they became even more upset at me because I didn't know what to say or do. \n\nIt sucks when you feel like you don't have anyone to turn to... but it will do both you and the other person even less good if you seek out counseling from someone who has no experience with your current obstacles. When seeking therapy, sometimes you have to go through multiple therapists in order to find the one that actually works for you. It's the same with treatment methods because there are many different kinds. For some people, talk therapy is best. For others, they may need cognitive or behavioral therapy.  Or, again, seeking out support groups, maybe even ones online.",
