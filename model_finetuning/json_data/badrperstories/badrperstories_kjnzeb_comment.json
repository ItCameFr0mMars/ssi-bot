            "body": "I would absolutely feel peeved about that... I did actually have someone try to steal my character, although they tried to do it in a very sneaky manner. Basically, they took my character, his wardrobe, hair color, personality, and even speaking habits and just gave their version of the character a different name, ethnicity, eye color, and made his hair longer. It wasn't obvious to me until my character shared a scene with their character, and their motions and speech were nearly identical, to the point that it was just weird... Their character even used a catchphrase that mine used periodically. \n\nWhat was weirder is that other people in our RP group apparently got confused and thought that the copy character was actually *me* trying to rebrand and rename my original character. I decided to give the person the benefit of the doubt, though, in that sometimes people will copy an original character as a starting point for them to develop their own more unique character over time. Like, I have an original character that was originally based off of Sephiroth. But so much time later, he now has a very different personality, background, style, etc. He just needed to start from somewhere. So I figured this situation was very much like that. I ended up mentioning to the RPer that I noticed our two characters were very similar, and I suggested that they perhaps think about pushing their character into a different direction so that our characters would be more distinct... Eventually, they did start to do that, and their character's style of dress began to change. They started dressing more like a cowboy lol! Well, hey, that was a decent enough step away from fancy business casual suits and vests. The character's personality was still very similar, though, but eh... I comforted myself with the knowledge that no one could play my character better than me, and fortunately, he was established well enough in the community that people knew he was the original. \n\nThat said... if people had come to the conclusion that *my* character was the copy, then that really would have stung. I'd have definitely felt that on a physical level, so I do not blame you for being upset...  it gets even weirder because you watch the copycat character behaving in ways that your character might not have exactly, and it starts to look like a weird *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* sort of deal... Maybe the best way to approach the situation is to take back your character and really own it as you play the part. Play your character the way they're meant to be played and reestablish their presence in the community. Alternatively, if it's just too awkward or painful, there's no shame in looking elsewhere for another group.",

When they made the reboot, they should at least reached up to you and ask you if they could have used your character instead of blatantly steal it.\n\nThis brings back memories, memories of the \"friends\" I briefly mentioned in my first post.\nYou got your character stolen in a new server, I have seen submitting a character that is the watered down version of my very first one. In a server where this character existed already.\n\nOkay let'so go with order. So long story short recap, the \"Friends\" are this group of idiots which main amusement is circlejerk, take over servers so everything runs their way and they can rulebreak every single time while you are under their regime and must just endure it.\nThey happened to be the people that ran my first RP experience where I created my first character, but I met some good people in that place and fled to another server.\n\nAfter some months of tranquillity the \"Friends\" storm the place and a few sit down to roleplay, the other joins only to defend their friends in case they get into fights, I guess to be more than the \"enemy\" and so be right (I am 100% sure they do not know the difference between arguing and discussing a different ideology).\n\nWell. Apart from seeing old faces Falcon's literal Lucifer, the Phoenix's Phoenix mother etc, Dragon's character that teleported through timelines and dimentions (which by the way goes to harass my character that was in my server because they loves mine despite this person is in a relationship both in their and this other server already good heavens take a hint) enters the Rabbit, the moonpie of the group that is supposed to act... Cute? \nBut at best, she's the loli of the anime you cannot really bear even if your life depends on it. It's annoying.\n\nBut the best comes when I am having a week off due to their headache. Rabbit most likely went over my old sheets in the server and uploads a watered down version of my very fist character. \nIt's basically a cheap ripoff.\nTo make few examples:\n\n-Same gender, same sexual preference, same age.\n\n-They both are mages, of the same specialization too.\n\n-They both have the same damn likes and dislikes.\n\n-They both have the same character traits\n\n-They both had a long lost sister to find in the backstory.\n\nThe only thing that was changed was the name, the appearance and picture and the backstory a little, since the Rabbit's was 3 lines of text while mine was a bit more developed.\n\nYet they had the face to tell me they \"took inspiration\" after a couple of months of denial they were creating a ripoff of my character, and that I should be proud of that. I was -livid-\n\nSo I know how you feel.",
