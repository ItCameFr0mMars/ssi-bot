I gave him a couple weeks before checking back in with him. He kept saying he was \u201csuper busy\u201d, yet he was always on Steam playing games or posting on Reddit. Another guy did the same thing recently. He was very prompt with his replies and all the sudden he was \u201cbusy\u201d. I tried to give him space until I saw him post on Twitter that he was bored and wanted to know if anyone wanted to talk or RP. Like WTF? What about our RP? I immediately blocked him.
