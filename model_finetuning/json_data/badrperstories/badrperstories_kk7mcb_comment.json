Even in sticky situations, i will be fine. If i get hurt or lose, this can be a lesson for me and do better in the future.\u201d But sadly, from my experience, that never happens. Like, helping is okay, but constant saving so that their character can \u201cbe a hero\u201d all the time, is hogging the spotlight.
