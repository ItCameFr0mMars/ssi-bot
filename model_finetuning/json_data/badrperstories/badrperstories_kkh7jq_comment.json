However this player revealed themselves very chill and this far I haven't seen nukes going on, so I guess we are pretty dandy.\n\nOther times we get mild OC who then gets a superpowered mentor and a ultra sword able to make them invincible. \n\nI usually question the player you are speaking with, and if said person is flexible and open to change and communicate nicely without standing too much their ground making stuff up to keep the OP stuff on, usually it's a good sign.",

For example, my character for a realistic fantasy roleplay would be totally different from a character I create for a roleplay which is more based on fantasy animes. Because in anime, some pretty overpowered stuff can be normal when everyone has similar powers. A lot of times, I just assume that my writing partner might have a different definition in mind when we talk about fantasy and  try to talk to them about it. \n\nA lot of times, the people who created 'cringy' characters were actually more chill about changes and compromises than people with 'better' characters, so I try to get to know them first. That does not mean that you have to ignore all the red flags of course, but some people are too strict and might be missing a good time.",

I saw another comment on another post, and they had mentioned that Mary Sues are designed to outshine all the other player characters in the roleplay and reduce them to being the supporting characters in the story. \n\nI've roleplayed with people who created characters of higher power or status, and they are usually played so well. I think that's because they're balanced out and given weaknesses that don't make them seem so invincible to the conflict. \n\nMary Sues typically have little to no character growth. Good characters don't end the story in the same spot where they started. \n\nI dunno. Maybe I did jump the gun with the term?",

A lot of the things your mentioned are red flags for a Mary Sue, and in combination they made their character bad. I think that it is just important to remember that one trait which could be viewed as...questionable (for example a character having eyes that can change color, being super pretty or having animal features) does not make the character a Mary Sue. A lot of stuff can be written well when the writer is capable of doing so.\n\nYeah, the worst part about Mary Sues (for me) is that their writers often view them as the only main character, the one who gets the guy, the one who has the only sad backstory that matters (and often, the backstories of the other characters are totally ignored), the only one whose feelings matter (and when not every character wants to be their therapist all the time, they are evil) and the only one who gets cool action scenes where they save everyone. Especially in a group roleplay, that mindset makes it impossible for other people to develop their characters.",

            "body": "Totally! The unique features alone don't make a Mary Sue, depending on the medium of the roleplay. The one I'm currently in has \"mutant characters\" that would have traits like lizard skin or amphibian limbs, but they are still relatable characters. \n\nAnd in a group roleplay, everybody's character is a protagonist. That's how I view it. The Mary Sue has never had to make any sacrifices to further their own story and disregards the feelings of everyone else. \"Look how awesome my character is! Everyone else is beneath me! I need to be shipped with the prom king of the group! I always get what I want!\" It's one of my biggest pet peeves out there.",
