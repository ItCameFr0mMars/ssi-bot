I understand the feeling since I had experience with OP characters as well. \nI would have left too if I was in your place to be honest. \n\nYour post reminds me of a player who used to be in the server I am in: OP characters who had almost everything when it comes to powers and/or weapons. When he was asked to nerf the characters, he immediately goes with: \"If you want me to stop making characters just say it\". It's... not the same thing. \n\nNot only he created OP characters, but he had a childish personality, making bad jokes about some characters (mine as well). \n\nEventually he got banned, since he wouldn't stop and even ended up insulting admins simply for asking to nerf his characters and because he even created his own event without permission. It was basically impossible to communicate with him. \n\nSo again, I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you find people that are willing to talk instead of insulting.",

It equals to godmodding as these people are omniscent and allmighty. \nPlus it triggers me the \"friend\" Fox's signature character.\n\nThe one that had listed in their character sheet:\n\nPowers: Magic\n\nYes. I am not even kidding. \"Magic\" and that's it, no specification at all. I can't even... Gahhh\n\n-Character sheets are important. Do not neglect your character sheet. Make it full with strengths, weaknesses, powers and backstory. Fox was a bad person who didn't complete their character sheet and acted like a god. Don't be like Fox-",
