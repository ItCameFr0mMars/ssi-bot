I'm sure that's someone's cup of tea, but those are things that are often given as red flags for Mary Sues for a reason: they often indicate the lack of ability to write a character with depth, and the author is substituting those crazy super-rarities for true work in creating a rich, layered character.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that those kinds of traits don't have their place; some people like to write wild stories with improbable--even impossible--plots, characters and settings. But even then the character needs depth. Purple eyes aren't enough to make a character feel \"real\", and being unique isn't the be-all and end-all of developing an imaginary person. They have to have a life, a history, feelings, likes and dislikes, a family, little things that make them, well, them. \n\nAs I said above, the reason that the things you described became red flags for Mary Sues was that many people believe that the characters they write have to be unique to be good, but in their lack of experience or ability they think that just picking super-rare traits is how to make that happen. In my experience, if you put the work in to think through all the things I mentioned above (family, history, feelings, etc.), and add in that bit of yourself that will inevitably be part of your writing, the person you're creating will be unique; they won't be able to be anything but.\n\nBecause yes, of course we all put s part of ourselves into the characters we create. It's still squicky for me, though, when someone is just straight-up playing themselves. The last thing I want is to be is a supporting character in someone else's epic tale of Them and Their Wonderful Adventures. No, I take that back--that's the second-to-last thing; the last thing I want to be is someone's pseudo-therapist as they work through some issue via a story I'm writing with them. (Ever seen those ads that basically read \"You'll play my ex-girlfriend Sarah, and we'll get married and live happily ever after? Ewww! Now imagine that's what's happening, but it takes a few posts to realize that's what your partner is doing! At least if they flat-out say it in their ad, I can easily avoid it.)\n\nAnd besides, If I wanted to play myself, I'd just spend the time I spend writing either writing my autobiography or just...being me!",

I think what makes someone a Mary Sue in a roleplay is if they were made to outshine everybody else in the story and make them feel like they're only there to play support. They started and ended the story arc in the same spot; no real transformation as a character whatsoever. \n\nNow, I'm not saying that being unique is a bad thing. A character can totally be rich or have certain powers, but they gotta have the character depth and believable weaknesses to make them compelling. Something that says, \"I can't solve this problem instantly.\"\n\nI do agree that we all put pieces of ourselves into our characters. I think the self insert part comes from the writer basically making whish fulfillment character who doesn't have the same flaws as they do.",
