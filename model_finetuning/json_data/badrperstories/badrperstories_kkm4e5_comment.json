            "body": "I do not see any of these cases as God modding. Instead, I see them as legitimate tools for a good master. \n\nAs a Gm myself (or CM as you like to call it), I often do both these things. I have a written rule about it that my partner knows about, that is RTK and PTK. RTK means Reason to kill, which means I got to find a serious in character reason to kill a character, and more importantly, I got the Permission to Kill, which means I need their approval to make something nasty happen to them. I tend to go overload and things get confusing in case there are too many people in one place, so I guess I could see myself create impossible to dodge mechanisms that are harmless, that thicken the plot a bit, and that give me the possibility to handle a party better. \n\nAs for describing beforehand what may happen in case they stumble over something they may want to investigate? I do that frequently myself. It is easier to nudge players in the right direction instead of making them ask countless questions/investigations trying to get to the solution of the riddles. \n\nI think with a little faith of your player, these are not things that make people go \"ugh another railroading master\". Just give your people a thin safeline, they may stop fearing you and instead have more fun\n\nu/Fahlilla can probably speak for me XD",

If you mean with an rp partner, I personally consider both to be equal and contributing to events or atmosphere unless agreed beforehand. \n\nThat being said as a player in a D&amp;D game, it would be annoying and I'd likely get frustrated and disinterested if I had traps spring in the group with seemingly no chance to detect them beforehand. If you are having them make a check to detect it or they are being reckless like running full tilt down a hallway then that makes sense and I'd deem fair. If someone started DMing actions that forced or railroaded me into their preferences, I'd personally nope out of the rp or D&amp;D session. While it isn't the type of godmoding I typically encounter, I definitely would find it to be putting my character into forced moments without it being based on skill or my actions. \n\nThat's just my personal opinion. If you want to play a DM a certain way I'd discuss and give examples like the one above before you start and make sure they'd be okay with it.

We urge open chat and often have designated banter chats where people actively in an RP can put all their relevant gabber OOC without loading up a casual OOC chat where people are just hanging out. Doing so, we'd hope if there was a truly an issue they've have immediate feedback and communication on whether something was going well or not, but we also can't force anyone to use them.\n\nWe had an issue with that once, where we had a side plot going in involving a sudden storm brewing in an open field (lots of wind and rain, etc) and a child going missing while looking for someone (a PC). We'd hinted at the storm for a while, and gave chances for the player to see the child was going to go looking for their character; we didn't drop it at once, or out of the blue. It was supposed to be a bonding moment that would bring the PC closer to the child (adopted big brother vibes) and the group as a whole, but the owner of the character made no effort to say they were uncomfortable or unprepared.\n\nThey just godmodded half way through and wrapped up the sideline without warning, then bailed. We attempted to apologize and make sure they knew we weren't bullying them, and they should have said they didn't want to go so hard on this plot, buy they didn't. We still feel a mixture of guilt and salt over how it went down and after that, we stopped doing 'random' events outside of our main group unless someone specifically asked to join.",

            "body": "Godmoding, for me, is pretty simple - the other person controls a significant aspect of my character or the scene without asking me first. It also heavily involves communication. I'm probably going to say yes if you ask if your character can land a punch on mine, but I'm not going to be impressed if you write your character randomly WWEing mine through the floor. I don't care if someone says my character followed theirs into another room or took something that was handed to them, because that's inconsequential in the long run, I'm more concerned with things that could have permanent consequences for my character or relate directly to the plot. \n\nRoleplay is meant to be collaborative and deciding what another character does (or doesn't) say or think or do takes away the collaborative aspect. If I'm being told my character has to be a certain way, my interest rapidly drops off. I'm not here to play a glorified NPC, I'm here to play half of a partnership. I could play a video game or watch a movie if I wanted a character's personality and actions dictated to me. \n\nI think it might help to pause a second and put yourself in the other person's shoes for a moment. Would you be angry/upset/annoyed if they did to your character what you're planning to do to theirs? Of course, this isn't a foolproof thing, because different people have different limits, but it may help. You can also google godmoding and powerplaying to see how they're typically described.
