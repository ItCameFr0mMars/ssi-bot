A month without response (or a message to say they'll be AWOL) is normally my limit with these people, though for the newer RPers, i give it three days. 3 days with no OOC, no \"sorry, can't reply today\" or anything, and i'm outie. I always send a message, and I always wish all of my partners a good morning (unless they tell me not to) and i try and make sure I'm friendly with all of my partners, so i know who is a bit flaky and who consistently responds, which also affects my decision on this. TL;DR just do what feels right. if 3 days feels right, then 3 days. if a month or 2 months feels right, then a month or 2. Just do what feels best for you",

            "body": "I've been running a group server for a few years now, and in that time I've been nerding out over tracking RP trends which might help you in this.   \n\n\nFirst, it's not uncommon to find really amazing writers around Autumn. I'd say early Autumn, circa the ending of September until mid November is when you get the long-lasting role players who are used to writing multi-para and capable of carrying scenes. They come out of the wood work in this time, which sounds on brand for this woman.   \n\n\nThese players will usually stick around into, at least, early Summer, but usually they'll stay as long as it takes. Some of the best writers and writing partners I've met have come in during this time, I love Autumn players. BUT they do slump a little from early December into late January. There's two reasons for this. One is that they're students and early December is final exam time followed by travel, followed by holidays, followed by going back to school, followed by them getting settled into their new schedule. The second reason is that they have kids who go through those steps.   \n\n\nPlay for them usually *starts* to pick back up with the same regularity as they had in the beginning around the second week of January but they'll be fully back into the swing by the end of January.   \n\n\nIt's not an absolute, but this is the more common trend I've seen in Autumn players.   \n\n\nWhat you do with that information is up to you. *I* would personally tell you to leave the server open and not pester them until at the earliest, January 2nd. I know from personal experience that Autumn players are some of the best writers I've ever encountered. I don't know what it is about that season, but the players who poke their heads up are some of the most amazing creators I'll ever encounter. I'll bend over backward to make an Autumn player feel welcome because I know they have lasting power and they're loyal to their stories.   \n\n\nBut, for a one on one story, it's different. You don't have a larger group to keep you occupied while they're doing their holiday stuff. If I were in your shoes, I'd post a message in the ooc of the server to tell them you get it if they're dealing with stuff, no rush on posting, reaffirm that you love what's been written so far, and then just leave it open. If it's Discord, you can have hundreds of servers open at a time, so there's really no need to just delete it. That's so final. These are the types of players you want to keep around and inspire loyalty with. You're not under any contract that says you can only write with them, so what's the harm in leaving the server open and then looking for something else in the meantime? If you find something, great, now you'll have TWO outstanding stories to fill your new year with. If not, you didn't shut the door on a phenomenal story and when they're back to writing, you'll be happier'n a pig in shit!",
