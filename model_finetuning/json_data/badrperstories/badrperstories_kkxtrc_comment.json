If he's not enjoying rp because he's feeling uninspired or isn't happy with the quality of his posts, that's on him. I'd tell him that you really enjoy rping with him and your story, but be honest that you can't make him happy with being a part of it or change him. You'll burn out if you constantly have to talk him out of quitting the rp in my opinion. If you're willing to keep the rp in limbo indefinitely that's your choice, but don't \"wait\" for him. Be his friend of you'd like ooc, but go find new partners in the meantime. \ud83d\udc96",

            "body": "As the other commenter said, you really can't \"fix\" his insecurity over his own writing. However, one thing I like to remind both myself and my partners about is that I tend to think of roleplay like the \"rough draft\" of a novel. It's usually waaaay more immersive and detailed than a novel would be, there's often some meandering around while you work out the plot, characters are being figured out as you go, and there's a lot of superfluous stuff that would likely get cut out if it were ever theoretically turned into a novel. So, use that to your advantage, and any time he's nitpicky about his writing, remind him it's \"just the rough draft.\"\n\nIf he's especially critical, he can always go back and tweak. I tend to use GoogleDocs exclusively for RP and I love how easy it is to edit things after the fact. Discord, too, if that's your medium of choice. But maybe that can soothe his perfectionist brain.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that some of his lack of enthusiasm may just be pandemic fatigue. I've noticed that my inspiration for writing has gone *way* down. I was roleplaying hot &amp; heavy all through the first several months of this, but now it's like I've hit a wall and the creativity just isn't quite there. He could be dealing with something similar, especially if he's got some \"mental hurdles\" like you mentioned. It's a rough time all around!",

            "body": "You're certainly right. I once had to prop up a partner who had full blown depression for 2+ years and would use me as a crutch and it only hindered my own mental health. Thankfully I broke free of that toxic RP-relationship. But I also know how insecurities can fester and take over all outside logic. We're so hard on ourselves as writers.\n\nI certainly don't want to burn out trying to lift him up constantly. I did sit on his message for a few hours before saying as much, like you said, that I enjoy writing together but want him to be comfortable and not feel any pressure from me. And if he needs to walk away, I get it. It makes me feel shitty he feels inadequate. I know I can't fix him or get him to change his personal view of himself. I really hope he sees what I see, at some point though.\n\nI have been trying to find another partner in the event this one needs the time away from things. You're right, it's always key to think of your needs and to accept some things can't be controlled or changed as much as we'd like. And I can't 'wait' on him or put my happiness in that singular RP, as easy as it is get to get tunnel vision with that great RP you're in love with haha.\n\nI appreciate your feedback/thoughts. You sound like a really awesome, considerate person!",

I do that from time to time if I feel antsy about a post and I've said as much to him. But it might be good to remind him that if he doesn't like his post, he can tweak as he'd like, I won't mind either way myself. And you're also right about the time of year. I know his work has been a little difficult the past 1-2 weeks, and given holidays it might just make him extra anxious than usual. I hope you're having some good RPs going on yourself and thank you for the thoughts and different perspective on things! :)",
