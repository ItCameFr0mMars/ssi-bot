Add life and responsibilities, work and kids, keeping house, and yeah sometimes things take a while.  Also, somebody can be online 24/7 now thanks to phones and constant connection, but not be in the mindset for writing versus chatting, which really takes no brain power. \n\nIt is up to you to drop them if you want, if you like the roleplay enough to wait a bit for responses, but there are also people out there who can be there 24/7 and like the rapid response thing.  I personally do not, so I do not play with people who want a post or more a day because neither of us would be happy with that arrangement.  But it is very possible they LOVE the roleplay, but are actually busy as they told you and just do not have the time in the moment to get you a post asap.",

Roleplaying is a hobby, not a jobby, and as frustrating as it may be to wait, it is arguably even more frustrating to have someone breathing down your neck and asking you \"are you unmotivated?\", \"are you still enjoying this RP?\", and \"when are you going to respond?\" if you take a little longer than usual. As another user also mentioned, it's the Holiday season, and there's a good chance people are spending more time with their family and less time writing. My advice to you would be to be a bit more patient and to just wait things out until mid-January. You'll eventually find partners you really click with, just give it some time!",
