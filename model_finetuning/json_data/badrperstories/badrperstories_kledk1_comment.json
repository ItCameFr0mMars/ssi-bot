However, this also assumes the staff are competent, fair and well-liked, which these guys appear to NOT be.\n\nSo I'd grab any character info you want to save, and just bail. It won't get better from here and nothing sucks more than to retcon an entire Character because you got really attached to it but the server died out entirely and now they no longer make sense to have anywhere else. Go while the getting is good and find a healthy server for your ninja to exist in.",
