If they gave you a reason that involves what you can control, contemplate it some and see if it's something you can improve or its just personal preference. If they have simply poofed, give them time and send a message. \n\nDon't write off to with others. I treat rp like tv shows... Sometimes they get cancelled for no good reason and you have a bit of a stomp and a pout and then find something else to watch.

I loved that story and writing with that person enough that it was worth the wait to me, but if that's not you there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nSorry either way, because I know how much it sucks to lose something you're really enjoying, as well as the company of someone you like writing with!",

Honestly, it felt good to have vented and it gave me new power to start looking for others to write with. \n\nI met quite an interesting bunch again.\n\nIt's just really sad that I cant seem to find someone who will stay engaged for a while you know? Like... not only a couple of months, maybe even a bit longer. But I get it. Interests shift from A to B in a matter of weeks. Thats how humans work.\n\nSo yeah. I was never really pissed or so, just disappointed, but I hope they are doing better soon. Who knows. Maybe they'll reach out to me again. I'll see. If not, I have met some cool people to write with :)\n\nThank you for listening to me though! And the advice is much appreciated!",
