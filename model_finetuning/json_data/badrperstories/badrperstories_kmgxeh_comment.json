Then I recruited him into my server on Discord after reconnecting and his writing was just awful. Not in an elitist, herp-derp illiterate bad way. It was awful in that there was no substance, nothing interesting about the character or the content. And he *also* made it clear he couldn't or *wouldn't* RP without a love interest.   \n\n\nI felt bad because we had a long history of writing together, but ultimately I kicked him because I had a server to run and I can't be showing favouritism to one player who's not even earned the treatment over another.",
