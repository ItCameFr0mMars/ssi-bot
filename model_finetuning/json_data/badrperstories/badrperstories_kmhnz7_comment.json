It really does such when they just vanish without a warning or a trace.\n\nIt's kinda hard getting over since finding a good role player is like trying to find the world's smallest needle I'm the world's largest haystack.

Some people would genuinely lose notifications there and needed reminders, while others would block you the moment you tagged them after a couple of days, asking what was up. It was super weird..",
