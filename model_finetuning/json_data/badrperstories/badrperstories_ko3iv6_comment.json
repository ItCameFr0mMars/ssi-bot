If you create a Batman you'll be tempted to scale them up to Superman levels, so instead try creating an Iron Man. Really powerful for a lot of reasons, but still mortal with at least one *big* weakness (ie being out of the suit). Then once you get comfortable with that, scale it back a little more, until you're back at that base level you started with.",

If simple power plays back and forth are the type of storytelling you prefer... there's nothing wrong with that.  \n\n\nIf you want to make characters that are actually interesting beyond their superficial powers, however... figure out the **why** of their actions. What do they want, and how far are they willing to go to obtain their goal? Where are their moral guidelines, and how might they differ from the other run of the mill superheroes?  \n\n\n  \nHow is your character's **personality** and **outlook** different from the generic superhero band, and what influenced him/her?  \n\n\nFor me, I'd be far more interested in a superhero that showed up to a crime scene barefoot because he gave away his shoes to someone in need and didn't have time (or possibly money) to get new ones... than in a superhero who just single handedly defeated the super badass ultra villain from the bigdick universe.

            "body": "I'd say it's 100% possible to have a conventionally \"weak\" character and make them badass, so to speak. One of my characters is a regular ol' human baseball player who beats an OP character to death out of pure adrenaline just because they kidnapped his sister, using every weapon she uses and just repeatedly bashing her with it. Normally he would never be able to do that, but in the heat of the moment he flew off the handle. So don't underestimate the weak, you can make some pretty sick characters with fun stories that at first glance seem like a nobody",

            "body": "I understand your concerns in the matter. You may feel insicure and scared that your characters may die while facing ultra-powerful foes or for not being not considered. \n\nI roll with what other replies have said: being overpowered is fine if others allow that and are cool with it, however I suggest you to also create a secondary character, which is something completely a nobody (mark my words, I do not mean a low-effort character, but instead a regular person). \nI once was clueless as you about how to make a good character that wasn't relying on powers, and ultimately I made this underpowered character, which I called Aria. She had her own story, motives and core dives but she hadn't any power, skill in combat, knowledge or wits that could exceed the ones of a normal person while being in a world full of magical creatures and demons. She was simply a fan of my main character which is a powerful mage, but she didn't have any powers awaken in her at all. \n\nIt was fun to play with Aria as everyone attempted to teach her new things instead of ignoring her, they gave her some little powers and such. Overall, they interacted with her as much and perhaps even more than they did with my main character.\n\nUltimately Aria taught me some of those which I consider the most important RP values of them all.\nHaving fun or progress the RP do not require having cool powers or saving the world. Even a small girl with a copy of the notebook of her favourite mage was able to interact with others and give them a hand :D\n\nI suggest you to give a shot to a very underpowered character, without giving up your strong characters if they make you happy",
