That doesn't mean I'm going to change their skin color, but I may assign them to a humanoid race that fits their features. One of my core character's fc was born in the Maldives. If I'm in an apocalyptic scenario she may not even know her ethnicity and I may have her born locally, but I'm certainly not going to change her skin color. \n\nIn the end, I don't sweat about it.
