There were so many thirsty guys on Deviantart back around 2014-15 (there probably still are nowadays) and I had quite a lot of fun with some of them when we weren't inclined to do romance or pair our characters up. \n\nAnd that is a good rule to live by. \n\nThere had been one guy who I had indulged in recent memory (maybe 4 years ago) and it just got to the point where I was no longer comfortable with role-playing with him due to the content and he got rather mad and actually pouted when I told him straight up no. \n\nYou've just got to learn what and where your boundaries are and stand by them.",

It just feels very awkward for me to roleplay mature content with a straight dude like that. Or maybe it's just me. \n\nAt least with other ladies, I feel like there's less of a chance they'll try to come onto *me* if we're doing a hetero couple or anything smutty and raunchy really. Like, NSFW roleplay is one of those things where you're not necessarily attracted to the person you're writing with, but the characters. Which is fine and waaaay less uncomfortable.",
