Overplanning could cause the feeling that you're \"living out the scene\" without actually writing it. And often, that can be enough to trigger something in your head that goes (Oh, I did this already. Boring.) There's no surprise so no motivation to continue on.\n\nSome of your partners will want to overplot. That's absolutely fine because it's personal preference. What I would recommend is to stick to your guns, let them know that overplanning kills your drive to write (if this is your issue). Good partners will respect this.",

You shouldn't ever feel like you're \"stuck\" in a portion of a story - that tells me that there might not be good chemistry between your OC and the other writer's OC to begin with. If your partner's style isn't engaging to you, it doesn't matter how interesting the premise is or how well developed the characters are. It'll read like potato.  \n\n\nAlso, that kind of subtlety on contributing would totally go over my head and I consider myself intuitive XD. I'd reply \"That's a great idea, OP!\" and be none the wiser that you wanted to hear anything else. I know you're trying to be nice about it, but straight out asking, \"What scenario should we put A &amp; B through? What would you like to see?\" will get you the answers you want.",

Group rp allows you to 1v1 with a writer you find interesting and essentially \"go on a first date\" with them to see if you vibe with their style.

The problem I run into is always that I never rp 1 on 1 and usually don't get much RP because I'm not apart of the clique, which is why I tend to keep my distance.\n\nAnd yeah, I usually try and interview, for lack of a better word, my partners. Ask questions about character ideas they had, backstory ideas, post length, etc. It has worked somewhat well for me before, but let some people through the cracks where I feel like I'm dealing with a totally different person than the one who responded to my post.",

No promises to keep writing should be made unless you feel a spark with their writing.  \n\n\nIf you don't wake up excited to respond to their post (especially in the beginning), you know they're not the right fit.

            "body": "I've run into a similar problem. I got back into roleplaying around the end of 2019/beginning of 2020, and then it was the perfect \"escape\" during the pandemic and I just went hog-wild and lucked out by finding a couple really amazing partners right off the bat -- one storyline lasted almost a year and we churned out a collective 600K+ words!\n\nBut I was also like a kid in a candy store and got enmeshed in a bunch of different roleplays on top of that one -- so much so that I burned myself out. I'd do the same thing and find a partner, work out a plotline with them and then roleplay fairly steadily for a few weeks, but then my interest would fizzle out. I think it was also compounded by general malaise and \"pandemic fatigue.\" Just so much of the same routine, day in and day out. It's slowed my creativity down to a trickle, which is a bummer, because I miss the creative \"high\" of roleplaying storylines with a skilled partner. But I bailed on too many people and I'm worried it's not going to change any time soon. Being stuck home so much sounds like the perfect time to write but somehow it's just eventually had the opposite effect.\n\nSo, maybe cut yourself some slack if you're just feeling tapped out. I think a lot of folks are. It's a strange time we live in.",
