Sounds like you handled it as well as could be expected, especially if that was the first time anyone had pulled that on you. Regrettably, I think if anyone spends a fair amount of time online, befriending folks we meet that way, it's bound to happen eventually. I'm glad you were able to move on from that and continue to find fun partners to tell stories with -- keep the drama in the RP, folks, not the OOC conversations!",

Not exactly the same, no people pursuing romantic advances, but I\u2019ve definitely had partners threaten to outright harm or kill themselves to manipulate me.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I\u2019ve dealt with enough toxic individuals that I\u2019ve learned to read the signs pretty quickly now, and I\u2019ve always got my finger hovering over the block button these days.\n\nIf I have any advice for you, it would be this: if you ever get these vibes from someone again, or they start on a crazy rant like this, just block them. Immediately.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them an apology or an explanation or anything else. Just cut off all contact immediately.\n\nYou\u2019re worth more than the time that would be spent trying to argue in vain with the sort of person who would pull this shit.",
