That's asking for betrayal and a quick easy kill because of how easy it is to deceive them and prey on their vulnerabilities, which is unfair, [give this a read, it's a pretty interesting article about pure characters](https://springhole.net/writing/purity-overrated-character-trait.htm). I've experienced this so I know exactly how you feel. \n\nNow I'm curious about something, did the other person know that you were expecting a friendship story? If they did then they didn't respect your desires. And since they threatened to off your character, they were planning this from the start and didn't want you to know about it, if they did, they would've had a mini Inner monologue or scene showing they worked for the bad guys. And if they respected your desires they would've set up a redemption arc. \n\n I can handle dark themes but even reading this story disgusts me.",

No violence, no surprise violence, no killing, no bad endings, ask to make sure a twist is okay with the partner before making it an official post, etc. And during discussion, you can see if they try to push your boundaries just in chat and then you can get a better idea on if they are the type to break your rules or not. \n\nYou said this happened a long time ago and probably know better now, I'm just leaving this here to try to help others to make sure they are less likely to find themselves in the same situation. \n\nI hope you never have to go through something like that again.",
