            "body": "I'm sorry you have to go through all of that. Some partners just can't accept 'no' and just don't like having to cater to other people's boundaries. That's a major issue with RPing/collaborative writing in general and the worst thing is that you can't really do anything about it.  \n\n\nI know precisely how you feel about a partner giving a weak excuse as to why they have to stop RPing yet keep posting ads anyway. (I've literally had someone tell me that they weren't interested in RPing period yet they still continued to post ads on Reddit while also trying to continue to talk to me as if I were their friend.) They probably think that's a polite way to say \"I'm done RPing with *you*\" or \"I'm just not interested in this RP anymore\" without realizing that their excuses are just the same as someone saying \"It's not you, it's me\" when it's so obviously you. Is it nicer than straight-up ghosting? I guess. It still kinda feels dishonest but at least they said *something* rather than just ghosting.   \n\n\nI've been burnt out on RPing in general lately, honestly. It's just so much effort to craft a good prompt/ad, go through everyone who responds, work out things with them, eventually get ghosted by some or even most of those people, find yourself with only like a handful of partners and wanting to find more RPs (and/or you find a new prompt to RP) and then the cycle begins all over again. I used to have so much fun posting ads and everything but it's become effectively a chore for me. Ghosting doesn't bother me as much as it used to, I've accepted it as a part of the hobby. I get that people have their reasons and dislike confrontation, trust me. Doesn't make it any less annoying/irritating to think \"oh cool we're going to get along... oh wait it's been like 2 weeks and they haven't replied\". It's hard to know what's wrong if no one tells you. Right now, I'm just at the point where I honestly don't really see a point in sending myself through that endless cycle over and over. Like you, I'm sticking with the partners I have now for the most part and just trying to enjoy those RPs.",

            "body": "I'm sorry to hear you've had some bad luck with people recently. You unfortunately cannot control the actions of other people, only yourself. I hope this is just a bump in the road for you, but the policy I set for myself? If I'm not having fun role-playing with someone any more, I talk to them about it oocly first to correct the issue- unless it's a brand new partner who I have no issues just ending the roleplay with - in which case I still talk to them but will still end the roleplay.\n\nRoleplaying is a hobby and it's supposed to be fun. If you're not having fun, take a break. The community will always be here and there are always new people getting into it. I have been roleplaying online on and off since around '97 - I was a kid then. I'm about to turn 35 this week. I have come and gone as I have needed a break. Sometimes it's just a couple days, sometimes it's a year or more. \n\nSometimes there are people you don't mesh with. Sometimes there are people who are just really awful and you can't get away from them fast enough. In every aspect of my life, I have encountered people that I have a varying range of emotions towards whether I like them or not. Even the fun stuff- to be honest, I have found that people tend to be more dramatic about the fun stuff than the work stuff, at least in my experience. I don't join clubs in real life or group roleplays any more because the politics and group dynamics have proven time and again to be no fun for me.\n\nYou do you. If you're not having fun with a roleplay, drop it. If you're not having fun, step away from the screen for a bit. Like I said, the community isn't going anywhere and there are always more roleplayers. If it's not fun for you, that is the only reasoning you need to walk away and take a break. Good folks will understand, not so good folks won't, and if they don't understand, why would you want to keep roleplaying with them anyways?\n\nI hope things get better!",

Hope you don't mind me calling that a trigger. \n\nRoleplaying used to be really enjoyable for me too, but the more I delve into it the more horrible experiences I get or watch from afar. There's a really bad ghosting problem in the community and toxicity overall has gotten worse. I've seen so many witchhunts or blatant disregard for their partner's feelings/wants/wishes/triggers. Most of the wonderful people of the community I have met are semi-active and are what binds me to stay roleplaying.\n\nI haven't roleplayed solidly in a couple months now, I had one semi-active roleplay with a wonderful person that's worn pretty thin. It's like whenever I go searching for new roleplays, I end up backing out in fear I'll get ghosted or look for red flags that aren't really there or at the very least visible. Everyone is so afraid of confrontation or just has a complete disregard for their partner's feelings in general. And it's just become the norm. No matter how hard you try to spread positivity and tell people it's okay to take a chance and gain a possible enemy by telling someone you don't want to roleplay anymore or you're having a writer's block, ect, ect..They still keep doing it. Not saying anything at all has become so common that it's a hard cycle to break. I've admittedly ghosted a few people too, I know it's wrong and I feel guilty about it, but I'm more afraid of what the person will say than if I say nothing at all. This is partly why I've stopped roleplaying, I don't want to leave people hanging when I know I won't be able to write on a daily basis or find motivation to write at all.",
