            "body": "Well, roleplay is mainly about having fun. Of course, it is impossible to write a canon character exactly as their author would. But that is not the main goal. It is a bit like reading a book and thinking 'how would my favourite character react? What would they do in this situation?' or thinking 'wow, I wish this character had a love story/their love interest is kind of boring, I wonder how they would interact with a different character?' Just letting your creativity flow and expand the world of your favourite fandom.\n\nOf course, you could just write a fanfiction about this. But this wouldn't be as exciting, because you can only use your own imagination, you can't plot with a partner who shares a similiar vision and there are no surprises. Every roleplay search has the potential to be entitled. It is true that some people who write OC against canon characters are super entitled, but there are also some people with super interesting Ocs who fit the world of the canon character and this can be interesting for people who want to explore writing the canon character with a different love interest.\n\nDoubling is also a thing with non-canon roleplays. For example, many people suggest doubling so that each person can write a female and a male character, even when both people write OCs. It happened to me so many times (including the entitledness, the other person not really wanting to write the male part, and the person expecting that I do all the work while they contribute nothing) and I never wrote roleplays with canon characters.  The same happens in Erps so that each person can write one sub/dom or bottom/top. \n\nIt is always like this: some people like doubling because they genuinely want to write both parts (canon/Oc, male/female, sub/dom, and so on), and a lot of people suggest doubling because they think it easier to find a roleplaypartner if they offer to write the less appealing role as well.",

One being that I will find a favorite character in a fandom and when their series has ended I miss them and I want to keep seeing them put into new stories. \n\nI will write against OCs but have found that the vast majority I have come across are poorly written OP/Mary Sue/terrible self-inserts that are used for primarily NSFW/ERP which is not what I'm here for. There is rarely any nuance or skill used in creating OC's and I become easily bored by the ones who strut in super powerful and wealthy and dominant despite never having existed within the canon before. I personally don't understand the desire to write OC's at all. \n\nI love taking characters I already know and love and putting them in new situations and seeing how those experiences change them. I like to think my portrayals are very accurate but that they grow and change depending on the stories I write with my partners. However while I have favorite canon x canon ships I rarely seek them out and am open on who I play them against. I kind of think of it like cosplay. I wouldn't want to cosplay an original character, I want to cosplay a canon character.",

It\u2019s just your interpretation that you think is somewhat right isn\u2019t it? \n\nOh boy, no one tell this dude about fanfic. \n\nBut to actually address the subject at hand: different people like different things.\n\nI don't often do any sort of fandom RP. But about a month ago, I saw someone on a site I use asking for a very specific pairing of a canon character against their... Well, I don't want to say OC because the player character in this game is a canon character as well... This is too complicated; if you're familiar with FFXIV, the pairing is their WoL against Zenos. In return they were offering to play *any* pairing, and so half as a joke and half as a serious question, I asked them for a ship that is... Pretty controversial in the fandom.\n\nHe said yes. So now we're roleplaying.\n\nIt is going well. It helps that I was already a fan of Zenos to begin with, and the idea of writing him presented a fun challenge for me. I've been roleplaying for half my life at this point, and there is nothing I love quite so much as a fun writing challenge any more-- just the same way that an actor looks forward to a challenging role. And FWIW, my partner says that I'm literally the best writer of this character that he's ever seen. \n\nThat's what it comes down to; if you're not a fan of the canon character to begin with, it's foolish to even entertain the idea of saying yes and starting a roleplay. If you don't want to do it, no one is forcing you, lmao. Just click out of their ad and find someone else to play with!",

            "body": "I exclusively RP canons, have been for almost ten years. I have never written an OC. Everyone else has kinda already said what I would've said, but:\n\nI was introduced to RP through fandom, so writing canons has always been the norm for me. I was drawn to RP for the social aspect, of engaging with other people that liked the same shows as me by writing various canon characters together. I am very particular about what canons I write; they're only ever characters I became really attached to, feel a connection to, or am otherwise very passionate about. I don't know anyone irl that enjoys the same things as me, so RP is sort of my outlet for it. Of course I can't write them exactly like the canon author/writers, but I can try to be as accurate as possible, I love analyzing my favorite characters, getting into their head and further bring them to life in new situations. It's my way of showing love towards these characters and the shows they're in. \n\nI'm also willing to write with OCs, and have written with some great ones, however not if they're only looking to ship or smut. Never done the whole doubling thing though and have no desire to.",

            "body": "&gt; If you\u2019re not the author, how can you accurately portray the character! \n\nFirstly, nobody is on trial here. If you portray your character inaccurately, as they say on the tiktoks, *nobody's gonna know*. Secondly, it's not true that only the author can portray their character accurately. There isn't some special sauce to writing internally-consistent characterizations - any decently competent writer can do it. In professional writing, for example, there's this thing called IP, which is when people are contracted to write stories for franchises (like Star Wars or Star Trek) - and I think a few of those are pretty good. In film writing, it's rare that a script is written by one person, and scripts for shows are usually written by a team of writers. And those can be perfectly consistent. \n\nI personally only play canons in my fandom roleplays. I also write canon-centric fanfiction. I enjoy the challenge of writing a fully-fleshed out character within the confines of a pre-set storyline. I also prefer to play against canons, because I find that people who are willing to make an effort with a canon are more knowledgeable about the fandom and more talented writers. A lot of OCs are Mary Sues tbh, and played by people who, like, watched the first episode of the Witcher series or something.\n\n&gt; \nBut isn\u2019t the whole reason doubling is a thing\n\nI think doubling is fun? It also fleshes out the world more than having just one character. There are probably people who double so they can play a canon for their partner and also RP the character they're actually enthusiastic about, but tbh maybe those people shouldn't participate in RP they're not excited about? I don't think it's inherently a canon RP problem.",

Yes, there\u2019s always a possibility you may not be portraying a character 100% accurately or may do something the author wouldn\u2019t agree with.
