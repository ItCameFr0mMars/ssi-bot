People just love to start plotting shit with you only to grow bored or to lose the attention span because people on tumblr tend to have one the equivalent of a tadpole\u2019s, it\u2019s so fucked up. \n\nFurthermore, whilst we are discussing Tumblr, I wouldn\u2019t take it personally. People on there tend to be shallow and are focused more on the aesthetics of their blogs and what faces they wish to play as opposed to any actual writing. I\u2019ve gotten people who stopped responding to me just because they didn\u2019t like a certain face, god forbid I don\u2019t play a Sydney Sweeney or a god damn Tom Holland or Harry Styles. They\u2019re elitists, for the most part. Most of them want to only play a certain type of character (uwu female), and expect you to come in with your male muse to satisfy their fantasies/desires via ERP. The Tumblr RPC is infuriating.",

I personally RP borderline females only (but not the 'uwu female' stereotype, no thank you). I don't expect male muses to 'satisfy my fantasies/desires via ERP'... That's just... Disturbing. I admit, I love a good ship, but I try not to force my ships on other people. If they want to RP something other than a romance, I'm more than down- it's fun to see what chaos people can concoct!\n\nSide note: I RP as female OCs and mostly male Canons because I like the male Canon characters (and want to portray them) but when it comes to OCs, I want to stick with what I know- or what I can guess accurately upon- which... Is female. *Shrugs.*",
