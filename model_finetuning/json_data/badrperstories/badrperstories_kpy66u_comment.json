            "body": "This. *This.* Everything about this, yes, exactly, you've put everything I feel about this topic into words. Honestly, the anti-face claim elitists are just as horrid as the people who just smack a face of their celebrity crush on their character or ask for their celebrity crush as a face claim without giving a shit about the content of the character being written. I've accidentally started a debate about face claims on here before, for some reason this topic evokes strong emotions one way or the other when it shouldn't. I've always used that film comparison, finding a face claim is very much like finding an actor to play out your character in a film or a show. Roleplaying isn't writing a novel, it's literally just writing for fun so why not add pictures if that's what your heart desires? \n\nI wish I had the artistic ability to draw my characters, or hell, all the funds in the world to commission other artists to bring my vision to life. Someone on here said that they've spent \"thousands of dollars\" on commissions for their characters, and whilst I don't know if that claim is true or not, obviously, most of us aren't that financially blessed to do so, especially not during this time. That would be fantastic, but that's not achievable for most people, especially being as this is a hobby at the end of the day. \n\nDo people misuse face claims? Absolutely. Do lazy writers or people who just want to enact a fantasy use face claims of celeb crushes? Absolutely. But not everyone who uses face claims is like this and I wish the elitists would understand that. Humans are highly visual creatures  so it's only normal that the idea of face claims is appealing.

            "body": "I wholeheartedly agree! It feels like they are two extreme opposites. It's really mindboggling how face claims has become such a sensitive topic to talk about, but if you were to put it into different words like I have here, nobody would be bothered by it. To me, the film comparison is very clear and precise, but some people just don't seem to get it. I think roleplaying might be such a broad term that it's difficult for people to see eye to eye because there are so many types of roleplay\u2014They prefer their version of it and are very adamant on staying that way, even if it comes across as attempting to establish superiority over fellow roleplayers. Not everyone is like this, but quite a few are pushy like that.\n\nI used to draw quite frequently, but I've never been able to draw my characters how I see them. Now that I think about, thanks to to Christmas, I actually have the money to commission an artist if I wanted to, but that's a lengthy process given the art world is independent and there are plenty of styles and scammers out there. That's amazing that someone could spend that much! Assuming they've had multiple commissions, I can see it getting addicting to have art made just for you. Though the artist definitely deserves the financial help!",

It\u2019s very time consuming and sometimes I just wanna be done with it and hop in to rp.\n\n2. I\u2019m not the best artist. I have no idea how to draw digitally and my coloring skills are subpar (I\u2019m a traditional artist). I honestly cringe seeing my own drawings slapped in front of a character sheet, feels like a kid putting their drawing on a fridge. Even my own drawings may fail to capture a character because it\u2019s not the quality I desire it to be. So I just use images of other characters I find on Pinterest. \n\nUsing face claims and pictures helps give people a more direct idea of what a character looks like because some people\u2019s images of characters will be different than what you had in mind. You can do a test with this concept-\n\nDescribe the character intensely to someone. Ask them how they would picture your character wear/ look. Now show them a picture of how you imagined them to look. Ask them was exactly how they imagined them. If they said it was different then that's the purpose of face claims, it's to represent a/your character the best way possible. Also, it saves a lot of time to re-account a character\u2019s features. Instead of having to go back, read and refresh an image of a character, you have a picture that shows you the character which will save a load of time describing them in dialogue. \n\nI consider myself an rp elitist but even I think calling others who use face claims lazy is crazy.",

That\u2019s kind of the point of them, innit? \n\nThe simple truth of the matter is that when you enter a space where people insist upon photographic face claims, you enter a space where the type of character you can play or depict is *intrinsically* limited to the sort of people who are photographed and who have pictures put online. So basically, everyone is playing some variation of \u2018generic beautiful pale-skinned (even if they\u2019re dark-skinned, they\u2019re usually the palest shade) model\u2019\u2014\n\n(Quick caveat here to say: if a person is stealing images from regular peoples\u2019 personal Facebook pages to use as FCs that person is trash and nothing can convince me otherwise)\n\n\u2014 and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m into. I do not like idealized model-pretty characters. Actually, I\u2019m not even that keen about human characters, to be honest. What now? \n\nBut I know from *experience* that that is how it works. On a whim this year I signed up for an especially hilarious-sounding group RP that required photograph face claims. It was *hard* to find a single person who looked even slightly *average*. If I had been looking for someone *unattractive*, or *overweight*, or maybe some combination of those things, perhaps with a disability or distinguishing feature? I\u2019m shit out of luck, without, again, stalking through random peoples\u2019 personal albums, and I\u2019m not trashy, so I can\u2019t do that.\n\nThey say a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words. Just give me the words, you can leave the picture off.",

            "body": "I agree with this COMPLETELY- There's a difference between using a face claim and then straight up just using lazy writing and I'd think there would be an obvious difference between the two, but for some reason, a lot of roleplayers DO consider it to be the same thing  \n\n\nPersonally, I'm not a person who's the biggest fan of faceclaims but that's not in general- I honestly don't mind it at all if my partners use face claims to represent their characters- face claims are a fantastic way to represent your character visually without spending time writing a long description that fits how your character looks, and not only that, is to your liking. There shouldn't be anything wrong with taking a person and using them to represent your character, and many rpers should see that there isn't anything wrong with that even if they aren't the biggest fan of face claims.  \n\n\nBut I feel like people who use faceclaims should absolutely TRY to put effort into their characters- because honestly, I ALSO see a lot of  lazy written characters- you could always tell just by reading the info they have that they're a throwaway or just plain lazy. Now, sure, write as many characters as you want and they don't always have to have intense written backstories or info or all that- but try to make them at least NOT 2D? You don't need to be a master writer to have an interesting character.  \n\n\nBut this situation usually isn't leaning towards one side either-  \n\n\nBut what really gets me is this:   \nLots of roleplayers who prefer using faceclaims literally act as if it's superior to every other form of visual representation, but at the same time, they go around complaining that people \"don't let them use realistic faceclaims\". And of course that's not all roleplayers, but it's absolutely very hypocritical. I get it I get it- oh- you can't \"visualize\" what a character looks like based off of a drawing, or a picsart, or a description- but then I hear people make that excuse and think- then why the hell are you writing? Why are they like- roleplaying with other people? If you can't visualize a character in your head based off of a drawing or a description then how the hell are you going to visualize scenes in the rp? Like that doesn't make any sense to me at all?  \n\n\nLike is it really SO bad to have an OC that is DRAWN? Like I hate to break it to people but it isn't abnormal having a person who's an artist creating original characters and wanting to rp as those characters as well? And just because a character has a stylized image attached to them doesn't make the character poorly written or bad to rp with? Like what kind of double standards is this? I don't understand? Both artists and writers are creative minds so why the hell do they not like- understand that drawings aren't terrible? No matter the level of skill in the drawing you can literally still get an idea for what that character looks like-   \n\n\n And it hurts a lot when you show someone your drawings and the person calls them ugly or unacceptable because they have a drawn face? And it happens more than you think too, because hell- I struggle SO hard trying to get someone who'd wanna rp with me because I sit down and draw ALL of my characters. I wouldn't care originally- like do whatever you want and all- if you are being a bitch over a faceclaim obviously that is a red flag- but the way people go around thinking they're so high and mighty and then insult your art or your character without giving them literally any kind of chance- not even reading their information because you think their looks are that bad- SUCKS- it SUCKS SO MUCH?  \n\n\nI have no damn idea why the hell some roleplayers are so against faceclaims, and I have no idea why some faceclaim users are so against every other kind of visual representation or description. It's like- insanely dumb how there's literally wars between these two groups- they're all writers- they're all creative minds so- why can't they just take whatever their rp partners give them and work with it? People claim they're always so flexible until they're faced with something different from what they wanna do- a drawn out faceclaim doesn't hurt- a realistic faceclaim doesn't hurt either.  \n\n\nOnce again, not all- but a lot of them. Be a good rp partner, y'all- it'll be more enjoyable for you both in the end.",

I'd rather RP without face claims, but if someone wants one, I can provide one. It's not personally useful for me. The only thing that grinds my gears is people who require drawn face claims, because I don't want to steal somebody's art and also there's no way I'm paying someone fifty bucks or whatever to draw a character I'll probably use once. But, whatever- I just don't play with them.\n\nOn a related topic,\n\n&gt; I have noticed more and more people put less effort into their character's form and just slap on a visual image. I know it's difficult to write a lot, sometimes it takes me a month to fully flesh out a character and even then, I'm changing them throughout the year if they still interest me.\n\nWriting these huge character applications (like 5,000+ words) that took like a week to complete was also a thing in jcink fora, and after I got out of that environment, I realized that I'm just *so over it*. Like, of course nobody wants to read your huge-ass infodump about your character, and probably you don't want to read theirs either. For group RPs, character sheets are necessary so that everyone knows who's who, but those overdesigned chat boxes in 9 pt font that ask you to write a fucking novel - I'd rather spend that time on my actual novel. I just have starters now and let my character and my partner's knowledge of my character develop as the RP progresses. There is no reason that somebody needs to know who my character's parents were or what shape their nails are. It's completely solipsistic and doesn't improve the RP experience.",
