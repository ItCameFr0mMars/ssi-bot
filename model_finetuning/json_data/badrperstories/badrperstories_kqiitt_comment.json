I am not saying 'everyone has to see this character as gay or has to consider the possibility of him being gay, or they are homophobic.'\n\nYou can definitely go right ahead and decide for yourself that a character is purely straight in your imagination.\n\nBut if someone theirself (like the examples given in my post) would include stuff that is totally far-fetched or even impossible concerning the information given about the character (for example him completely forgetting about his love who is so important for him and suddenly pursuing a different girl, or even him sexually assaulting someone even though he would never do that and is actively against it in canon), and then turn around and say 'you can't make him gay, that would be an insult and a mockery of the character and totally disgusting, he isn't gay in canon!!!'

            "body": "Yeah...I guess that is right. I think that is why I avoid making certain statements in my own searches. I always think 'Well, it will be enough if I say: I am not interested in writing (topic/pairing)' because:\n\n\\- I do not owe anyone an explanation why I don't want to write something, me not wanting to write it is enough\n\n\\-it will often cause misinterpretations and also attract people who share views I don't share at all\n\nIf I see someone simply mentioning that they don't like 'Zwangsverschwulung', my first thought is not 'clearly, this is a terrible homophobic person I should avoid, probably best to not interact with them at all'. If the person seems nice, I ask them to specify what they mean and then decide if I agree or disagree. But I had so many bad experiences with people who wrote entire paragraphs justifying why they hate writing gay characters and actually, no one should write them at all. \n\nI think my bad experiences are largely due to a chat I was in once. Seriously, almost all people who complained about this did so because:\n\n\\-they were straight dudes and women who really found the simple thought of their favourite male character being gay/bi to be disgusting and an insult of some kind\n\n\\-they were looking for people who would write the male part in mxf roleplay, but almost everyone wanted to write the female part. So they thought that all the mxm writers were really denying them the chance to have a writing partner by writing mxm roleplays and not wanting to write the male role in their mxf roleplays instead. Which honestly was such an entitled mindset.",
