I don't usually have many partners who delve into their personal life, but the few times it has come up I always respect them and tell them it's fine if they can't write much or anything at all for the next few weeks, months, ect. I understand how horrible experiencing a tragedy can be (I've had someone quite close to me slowly pass away) and I'm quite a patient person to begin with, as are most of my partners since I'm part of the slow writer club.\n\nNo normal person (Especially in such hard times) demands a roleplay like that after hearing you're dealing with such tragedies caused by the pandemic. I'm sorry you had to deal with someone so toxic like that. Any sane human being would end the roleplay or tell you it's completely fine if you can't keep writing multi-para posts and would gladly shove aside the roleplay to talk to you human to human.\n\nSome roleplayers need to stop viewing their partners as roleplay machines and should *actually* talk to them outside of roleplay.",
