            "body": "I can sympathize with this post, as myself and several others I knew in undergraduate went through this. The pressure of exams and papers makes you wanna write anything *but* your school papers. People hop from new shiny activity to another, looking for stress relief, new girlfriend/boyfriends consume your former favorite writing buddies time. Fandoms and RP communities that used to excited you start feeling bland, tropish, and flaky. \n\nThe only answer our friend group found was to lean into DnD style RP, just to enforce some semblance of structure. We ultimately ended up going with a home made system and our own lore since DnD was too restrictive (3.5). But! The lived experience of setting a time every week when we could sit down and meet, sometimes in person and sometimes online chat, did wonders.\n\n We had a \"GM\" who we wrote rules of conduct with, everyone agreed to the rules, and the GM enforced the rules. For example, if someone missed a session and didn't let us know ahead of time, we had the right to keep going. It was their responsibility to work with the GM to find a better time, or tell the GM how to bookmark their character. The GM knew our school and work schedules, we kept GM informed. \n\nAll of the original RP friend group came out of a immersion heavy RP background. We had tones of experience in writing backstory, dialogue, scenery, and plentiful side characters, so one of the other rules we worked with the GM was \"no character deaths unless approved\". If you know DnD style RP, you know this can be a problem point. We didn't want to put years and a novels worth of work into a character, then have then die from something petty. This rule meant people had a level of trust with the GM, and each other, to focus on the story and characters and not being murderhobos to survive. \n\nAnyway, sorry for long reply. Think over why you like RP, what parts are most important, and how you may get those parts from new sources. The internet has wonderful roleplayers if you find them, but no accountability. Sometimes adapting and branching out to new RP styles can help.",

They can\u2019t stay the same forever. \n\nI don\u2019t think requiring writing samples is bad, as it\u2019s better to ask someone to copy and paste something instead of getting two turns into a roleplay and realizing \u201cooooh...I messed up...\u201d and that you don\u2019t feel excited to rp with this person. \n\nIn my opinion, not that you can\u2019t have your own, they have every right to ask what they do, and they aren\u2019t responsible for holding up the rp community that once was\u2014rather, it\u2019s the outliers that may not belong. Of course, this is a rant, and you\u2019re free to say what you may. But communities can be vastly different, and yours sounds like it belongs to some very literate writers who spend a lot of time on their roleplays, and are as tired of ditching and being ditched as you are\u2014but this is their way of dealing with that. Perhaps they will learn better ways. Perhaps this is now the new norm, and it\u2019s conform or be crushed\u2014and if it\u2019s a truly dying community, it probably won\u2019t be getting any better from there.\n\nAgain, if a community is getting toxic, unfortunately the best thing to do is to jump ship into a better one, or make your own.",

            "body": "I thought about doing this as this is my second community I've joined, but the shift from my first community was huge. When I first started roleplaying I was very used to roleplaying in groups and responding quickly, not writing 15k words for each reply. \n\nMy second community started off as a bunch of very casual 1x1 fandom roleplays, often the kind with love interests and doubling up and yada yada. So you wouldn't expect it to turn into something with so many amazing writers who write dark themes and crazy worlds. At the time, it really confused me because I had no idea what 1x1 fandom roleplays were lol. However, I grew to really like the style and it really shaped my writing as the community grew more literate and niche, and I matured. Of course, a lot of casual roleplayers still remain, but the literate ones are on a totally different level. I haven't found anywhere else quite like it with both the 1x1 and actual group roleplays. Everywhere else I've seen is a completely different atmosphere and more confusing or just totally lifeless. \n\nIt's also not that I think they're bad, but I don't think they're always an accurate reflection of a rp reply. Aside from the fact I always feel very insecure about sending them lol especially ones with more specific requests like writing large amounts in 3 days, which just isn't feasible for me personally or a lot of the casuals still in the community.\n\nIt really does sadden me to see it get toxic and hear about all the toxicity from some ex-partners who've started getting really fed up with it all, but that might eventually be for the best. :) I probably should've gotten into more DND style roleplaying, but I always figured that was more fantasy-based which just personally isn't my thing. \n\ngonna stop ranting and raving because I could go on forever haha. thanks for all the advice guys!",
