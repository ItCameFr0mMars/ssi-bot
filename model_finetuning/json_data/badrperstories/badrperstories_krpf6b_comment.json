That you feel bad they are going through a rough streak, but that you're not professionally equipped to being their therapist. You don't mind them venting every once in awhile, but that you really need to surround yourself with more positivity and happy conversations right now. \n\nChances they'll get mad and feel attacked rather than be apologetic, but that doesn't mean you're wrong you feel as you do.  I don't mind bad days or even venting door awhile major bad events, but if day in and day out they are miserable than I have very little patience. I'm sad they are having such a rough time and I can feel bad for them and still not want to sucked into a constant diatribe of negativity.",

They will subtly pressure you to stay up later than you normally would to keep them company while they endure [insert emotional problem]. \n\nThey will grow upset if you take too long to respond or talk to other people. This will result in passive-aggressive comments and doubts of your friendship/how much you care about them.\n\nThe final stage of this is them having an aggressive outburst toward you if you ever offer constructive advice, make any mention that you don\u2019t have the time or mental state to listen to them vent, or do anything else that displeases them. They will always apologize and say they\u2019ll \u2018work on not doing that\u2019. They won\u2019t.
