It isn't mean to do that, and you have no need to feel bad.\n\nThere is a lot of societal pressure on women to always be nice and accommodating, and guys like this take advantage of that.\n\nAlso, your English is very good. Only advice I'd say there is add in a few more paragraphs breaks.\n\nIt is an important life skill to learn to set boundaries. And to place value on your comfort, and on your time. Think about what advice you would give to a friend dealing with a creep like this, and then be a friend to yourself.\n\nThe minute a creep ignores your clear 'no' -- and you were clear; there is nothing ambiguous about \"I'm not interested in talking about my sex life with strangers online\" -- he has earned an immediate blocking, and you should not feel guilty about that ever. \n\nIt feels super awkward when you are first learning to set boundaries and stand up for yourself, but it is one of those life skills that get easier with practice.",
