            "body": "This was a *really* bad story and I still think about it from time to time. A friend and I had 2 characters that had 3 kids together, we'd been rping for *sooooooo* long at this point and I guess they didn't want to continue, but they weren't sure how to tell me even though we had other characters/accounts together? \n\nSo, the couple was just hanging out and enjoying some alone time, sweet talking and happy, when someone broke into their home and killed one child but took the other two. Obviously the couple went out and searched, but before I could even say my character found them, my partner said they were dead. We had a bit of a supernatural rp, so I tried to essentially revive the children (it went along with the storyline my character had from a show, so it wasn't just out of the blue) but my partner said it wasn't possible because they were killed by something supernatural.\n\nIt was *so* weird and so upsetting that I stopped talking to that friend for quite some time. I told them it was hurtful that they decided to do that without talking to me, even though I knew the reason after the fact. We literally could have ended that particular story on a very happy note and just moved on and left them in a happy place with a wonderful ending, but instead I felt very bitter and a little betrayed. They weren't just my idea (the children), they were my partner's too so I would have been way more understanding if I had some honesty as opposed to just straight killing three kids out of the blue.",

            "body": "(The end of the prologue of the Second Act of the RP my ex / current best friend wrote together- Raven was previously my character, and her fate was revealed in the final moments of the opening chapter.)  \n\n\n&gt; All around Ruby, her body lead, life is snuffed out.  The most powerful men and women in the Republic are slaughtered in silence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raven screams.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fire envelops the Liberator.  The skies, for miles around, burn.  The true force of the Vylinius, burned out in a single moment, the shadows screeching and fading from her will.  The Watcher, too, fades.  Its green eyes go last, boring into Ruby.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The darkness is gone.  But half of the occupants are already dead, and Raven is on her knees, clutching her chest.  Pain and exhaustion cross her face.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No one seems to move, though they now can.  No one but Marcus, and he simply crawls over to his mother, to her side, whimpering with every movement, broken bones ripping through his body.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She whispers something into his ear, and then he collapses, unconscious.  Ruby\u2019s mother then makes eyes only for her daughter, leaning herself up against a nearby table, just breathing softly.  Blood pours down her chest.  Far too much blood.  Her armor has returned to her, somewhere in those flames, a careless afterthought for a prudish woman.  She smiles, and a droplet of blood runs down the side of her mouth.  As she does, the Liberator falls from the heavens toward the ground.  There are minutes, or seconds left.  Few of the people aboard will survive the impact.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Something makes Ruby stumble over to her mother.  To kneel beside her.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raven touches her daughter\u2019s cheek with a bloody hand, and nothing but love and regret fill her flame.  No anger, no sadness.  Just a wish for things that should have been.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI dreamed a dream, Ruby.\u201d  Her arms weakly pull the Revenant to her, blood pulsing from her wound.  Borne of cold iron, nothing can heal it.  It wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, truth be told.  The Chairwoman was too tired a year ago.  Perhaps she was too tired far before then.  \u201cThere\u2019s too much to say.  Just tell your mother I always loved her.  And I always loved you, Ruby.\u201d  She leans closer, as if it were a secret.  \u201cI always loved you.  And I always knew.  It\u2019s okay.\u201d  A tear brushes down Ruby\u2019s cheek, given by her mother.  A shudder shakes the Chairwoman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cRaven\u2026\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Someone says that.  Maybe Marcus, or Cain.  It didn\u2019t matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Quietly, so very quiet, so that only Ruby could hear, Raven whispers the greatest secret of all.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s not my name.  It never was.  Raven was better than me.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her arms tighten further, even as her body weakens.  Even as blood pours from her wound.  Even as her body begins to fail.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Liberator is so near to the ground that air whistles in through the shattered windows.  Screams start again, from meaningless people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Chairwoman plants her lips on Ruby\u2019s cheek, her last moment, her last choice.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cCall me Lyra, would you?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And then the Liberator slams into the cold, unforgiving ground, fire ripping through it, its broken metal frame collapsing.  The Chairwoman dies with Ruby in her arms, and midnight rules the world above.",

            "body": "Ah good ol' DRRP. Most of my character deaths in DR have been lame and unexpected. \n\nThe worst is one time a character of mine got stabbed multiple times in his sleep. The stupid part was it felt like it was solely because that player did not like me OOC. He also tried to frame the murder on my other character during the trial. And nearly succeeded. This all happened in real time roleplay with zones for each area, so people cant see what happened unless they are in that area. Only the admin can see all logs. So I was really dependent on the vote results. Fortunately the actual killer got main amount of votes. What was sad is that the killer was played by someone who added nothing to the RP (barely even participated) and the character that was killed had a lot of plot going on and caused for a lot of plot within the group. It was a character that really carried the RP.  His death basically made the rest of that run become super dull and go stale. \n\n\nThe most unexpected was how in another run my character got stabbed and then kicked into the swimming pool to drown after, for rejecting a kiss from this female, apparently yandere character. It became quite a funny meme at least amongst the group because it seemed really OOC for her. (Was a canon character.) But people seriously overused stabbing as a means to kill. \n\nLamest death I've caused in a DRRP was having to kill a student for breaking the rules when I was Monokuma. Kept warning them OOC that I'd have to do it if they kept going.  They did. So RIP.",

            "body": "Yeah, haha. It was a bad period where most of the players were pretty mediocre role players and honestly unappreciative assholes. The general IC response was three periods. They were so passive and boring and brought nothing to the table. It was like trying to interact with a wall. The good ones who'd also mod and oversee/run plots and events alongside of me were unavailable during this bad period.  I did have some great murders and trials, especially when I would plan then out with my team. It was very character and plot driven not solely for cases. We'd basically GM some murders at times and stayed quiet for the most part during trials only dropping small hints like posing a new question/discussion point when they seemed to need it. \n\nSadly a lot of awesome plot points for murders also never happened because people were flakey af in that community back then. I dunno about now. This was years ago. I might give it a go again one of these days. But I'm kind of put off from doing/managing group roleplays anymore after so many years when so much effort kept going down the drain time and time again.\n\nThe worst player I've had was one trying to dual meta a trial once. They'd write false thoughts for the sole purpose to try and influence the votes. The thoughts made no sense for the character to have. Nor are other players allowed to do anything with it. But you bet it influenced them. IC thoughts were not a thing for the most part due to characters needing their privacy and to maintain the mystery. It only ever was applied when it was for humor. \n\nI even got shit for banning that player for breaking the rules and not listening to me telling them to stop ruining the trial. It was such a toxic group looking back. I was constantly made to feel like an ass for trying to make something I put so much work in to run smoothly. So it really wasn't the best group of folks at that time. Hopefully if I ever get back to it, I can find more decent folks like you seem to have. Gives me some hope to know they are out there, somewhere!",
