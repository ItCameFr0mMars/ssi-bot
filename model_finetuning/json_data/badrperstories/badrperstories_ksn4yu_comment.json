They could literally change minor small parts about their body over a period of time to blend into their habitat. Like a chameleon but more in-depth. Nothing overpowered at all or even useful in most situations, but it was for lore purposes.\n\nMy friend refused to roleplay with them because according to them this meant they could, and I quote, \"turn into anything at any time like a trex or something\"\n\nlol ok",

            "body": "That's such a bold claim to make, imo. I personally don't think anything is too OP. There are people who don't know how to play powerful characters who get carried away and godmod etc. But I feel like, if handled well, a character can be extremely OP and still be completely playable and interactive. You've just got to be willing to accept that your character isn't as powerful as them, which is the case in real life, every day situations too sometimes. If you were to meet a Navy Seal you would not have the same level of physical or mechanical skills as them, it's just how it shakes out sometimes. Imo it adds diversity to a roleplay to have super \"OP\" characters. People who are put off by that have usually just had very bad experiences with people who don't know how to write OP characters, which kind of ruins the fun for the rest of us (I have a character who is a literal God, people get put off by him.) \n\nIn some rare instances that I've run into, some people are just very salty that your character is more powerful than theirs and they don't like it when things aren't about them all the time. I've only ever had a couple RP partners like that, personally but it does happen.",
