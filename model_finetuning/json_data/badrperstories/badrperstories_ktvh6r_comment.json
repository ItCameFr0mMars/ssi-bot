If you're getting new roleplay offers, don't be afraid to reject them or say \"Sorry, but I got a lot going on already.\" And if you can't handle your current load, don't be afraid to let your partners know! Communicating with your partner can relieve a lot of that anxiety. Especially when you get someone whose on the same wavelength as you. It may make you feel nervous at first, but it really is a huge relief.\n\nI've noticed it's pretty common for some roleplayers to start new roleplays with 40 different people without foreseeing the inevitable outcome of a burnout. This is exactly how ghosting happens and it's just not fair to yourself or the people your roleplaying with. Roleplaying should be fun, but this is one of the ways you can make it feel like a job or a chore rather than a hobby.\n\nI'm not exactly sure why people overextend themselves like this aside from not being able to say no or getting too overenthusiastic, but I think it also has to do with waiting for replies. It's normal to feel impatient and want to start roleplaying ASAP, but man does that lead down a bad road.\n\nHope I could help!",

(if on reddit)  I once had a very interesting reply that was exactly what I wanted, but the person was very active in alt-right communities.  Noped out of that one.\n\nGo through the rest and rank them.  Go with the top 3.  If something doesn't work out, go down to the next one.\n\nClose the ad.  If you forget to do that, you might get a few new replies.   Either toss them or add them to your ranking.",
