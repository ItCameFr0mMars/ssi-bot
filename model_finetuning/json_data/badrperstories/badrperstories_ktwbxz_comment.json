            "body": "I will say that I've found the concept of \"doubling\" a little odd in that it seems so manufactured. That is, I understand if each player wants to play characters of a certain gender or personality, but I usually just look for opportunities to insert them into an ongoing storyline.\n\nFor instance, I started an RP with a partner who was looking for an arranged marriage trope. I ended up playing the male love interest for her, along with a rival love interest who ended up becoming a big part of the plot. \n\nThen, later, through the course of the storyline, I introduced the daughter of one of those love interests, who ended up with a couple of love interests of her own (each played by my partner) so we both ultimately ended up getting to indulge in a lil love triangle fun, but we just let it develop organically in the course of the storyline, rather than insist on it at the outset.\n\nPersonally, I also find it easier to focus on the dynamic between two \"main\" characters at the start of an RP partnership, get them established, and then start introducing other characters to fill out the storyline as we go. Sometimes if too many characters are introduced at once, it can be overwhelming, and I suspect that may be why an insistence on \"doubling\" often fizzles out, since you're both struggling with four characters rather than two, and it's essentially multi-tasking.\n\nJust a lil advice based on my experience. Maybe start small and then pan out. Or, if you just really want to play more than one \"main\" character from the get-go, give them a dynamic where they can play off of each other (siblings, exes, friends), and then they'll already be part of the story in case your partner wants to introduce a love interest for them down the line. Just a thought!",

            "body": "Many people see doubling as some kind of compromise and not a preference of their writing partner, because they connect it to all the times they have been asked if they can do doubling just so that their future writing partner can write a female character in their roleplay.\n\n So if people read 'I can double' or 'doubling preferred', they often think this means 'I can double, if you really, really want me to' or 'We could double, but please go ahead and ask me if it would also be okay to just write one character each, I am happy as long as I can write a female character'  and not 'I really want/would love to double'. Often, when I am planning a roleplay and people ask me about doubling, I say 'I only write male characters, sorry' and nearly everyone reacts very happy that they can write only female characters (until they realize that they did not read my search correctly and that I don't write romance lol)\n\nA lot of people who really enjoy writing multiple characters do not really like doubling, myself included. Doubling often feels like writing two roleplays with one character each, which is not what I am looking for if I want to write multiple characters. Often, the characters are barely connected to each other.  Often, the drama and angst feels a bit forced (for me) because it often relies on outward influence (for example an evil NPC king, or a NPC seductress that wants to seduce one of the 'real' characters), and I like to explore the other side of a conflict as well. It is really hard, in my opinion, to invent four characters that have so important roles that they can include all of this on their own. Because in the beginning of the roleplay, I can't say (yet) which direction the roleplay will take.\n\nThe nice thing about writing multiple characters (for me) is that I can decide 'wow, this npc seems very interesting, I want to tell their story to and include him as a real character' while we are already in the middle of a roleplay. Or that I can write characters who are old grandpas without having someone be like 'I don't want to write this, I only want to write our pairings'. \n\nAnd doubling is hard, at least for people who only write one character most of the time. It is hard for some to focus on two characters AND give them the same treatment and screentime so that their partner will not be dissatisfied. You don't have this problem if you only write one each or two different roleplays.",

            "body": "It *is* manufactured. A manufactured romance. Most instances of \"doubling\" are kind-of self-serving as the intention is to have a love interest tailored to your partner's character and vice versa. This is often unnecessarily cumbersome for some people as they have to essentially write two separate storylines at once and it overall takes more time to write.\n\nThere also a slew of problems with this, as again, it is *inclined* to be quite self-serving: one side might get all the focus while the other teeters into oblivion. \n\nI personally have no problems with doubling up, but it depends on *who* I'm roleplaying with. As I'm someone who prefers not only the two \"main\" characters interacting with their love interests, but the other protagonist and side-characters. Some people seem to really hate having their oc interact with the other oc and want them to be in separate worlds, which I just don't really get? It just makes it feel more phony.",
