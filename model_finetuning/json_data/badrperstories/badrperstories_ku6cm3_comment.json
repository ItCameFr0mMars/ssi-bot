            "body": "It's possible it could have nothing to do with you. I think a lot of folks are feeling the strain of ongoing pandemic fatigue. I know I am, and had lost pretty much all motivation to roleplay. I had several excellent partners but I just couldn't find the enthusiasm to continue our plotlines, so I ended up bailing on all of them (although I did at least give them an explanation). But your partner could have just felt guilty about not feeling that \"oomph\" anymore, or maybe had his/her own depression/anxiety going on. Point is, it may have been nothing personal, just circumstantial.\n\nIf you really want closure of some kind, you could try reaching out, if you still have a way of communicating with them. I know that Discord can sometimes be tricky -- I thought I had gotten blocked by a partner but when I reached out via e-mail (we'd exchanged 'em because we were going to write via GDocs) to ask what was up, he admitted that he hadn't realized he'd blocked me and it was accidental. So, sometimes that happens too.",

I've gotten ghosted before, and it hurts like fucking hell (there is  one partner  that it took me a solid year to get over), but I've also had to **do** the ghosting myself to someone because no matter how much I tried to talk through our issues with them, they kept manipulating and gaslighting me to the point where I had no choice but to just cut them out of my life in an attempt to preserve my own sanity. I also knew that if I told them I wanted to end things, I would just be manipulated further into staying with them. Once all was said and done, they then swore up and down to all our mutual friends that they didn't do anything wrong to me. That everything was fine, and I just ghosted them for no reason which is complete **bullshit**.\n\nMy point is, ghosting can happen for a lot of reasons. It doesn't necessarily mean **you** did anything wrong. Some people are going through a lot irl and can't focus on online things, or maybe you did something unknowingly that they weren't ok with, and they couldn't muster the courage to tell you about it. I'd try to at least get in contact with them once to try to get some closure. However, keep in mind that if they don't respond back LEAVE THEM ALONE. That person I blocked tried to get in contact with me a lot after that and even had her friends message me on her behalf, I had to turn off my DM's and abandon my rp blog for a while until she stopped sending people after me. It was anxiety inducing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you're going through this. It will get better, it just needs time.",
