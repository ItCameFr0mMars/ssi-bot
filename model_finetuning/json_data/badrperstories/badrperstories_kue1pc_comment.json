I really hope you feel better soon and take all the time you need. &lt;3 \n\nMy situation came with a massive burnout, became disinterested with our rps. It was becoming very monotonous ad it felt like it was all about my partner's ideas. He disliked the characters I enjoyed writing and would turn down the ideas for my characters. It was not working out. Used to date my partner as well, didn't help I only roleplayed with him for nearly 2 years. Stopped roleplaying with other people altogether, so now it feels awkward hitting up new people because.. I don't know how to approach them XD\n\nNot sure if that makes sense: I don't like to control other people's characters.. for me it comes a bit with experience (that I've had before and I knew how it upset me, so I don't want to hurt anyone else). I want them to feel freely open and creative with their characters! Idk, sometimes I treat roleplaying like... real life. You don't know what kind of people you meet after all. So I feel the same way with characters. \n\nThat whole situation was very confusing to me. Because everything was moving very nicely, so that response sort of gutted me. It was nicely written, though. I even debated for a moment if they must have thought I will steal their OCs (? though I swear I would never ever do something like this to anyone, but you know!).\n\nAnd I always do that! I am even afraid I might come across annoying to others if I do. And sometimes roleplaying is not even what makes me most happiest. It is brainstorming ideas and headcanons for our characters together and building world together! \n\nTysm! &lt;3",
