All the brainstorming and chatting and plotting is definitely going to be part of the process, and if you don't \"vibe well\" with how they do it, it's probably not going to be a good fit. \n\nHonestly, whenever I started those initial chats with someone after answering an ad (or they'd answer one of mine), it was almost like an informal \"interview\" process to see if we'd mesh well. My own pet peeve was if they gave little to no feedback during our brainstorms; just one-word responses like 'ok' or 'sure.' I need someone to bounce off of, someone who will take one of my ideas and run with it and add their own spin. I want it to feel like a truly collaborative effort.\n\nAnyway, trust your instincts. You're not a bad person if you're just not feeling  it. It just means they're not the right match for you, so keep looking for someone who is!",

Let them explain, read over it, say what you think of it, then explain that you would like to explain your idea and then it's your turn to say your idea or ideas. \n\n\nAnd just an idea, not being mean, but long-term, I think maybe getting some therapy might be a good idea to take care of you getting so much anxiety over seeing a lot of words on one place. Being a good listener is just as important as talking as well. Both online and irl, you need to learn to be okay with some people talking more than you. You would want some one to hear you out on your big ideas when you get them, so it's the polite thing to listen when your partner has big ideas.",

Like the others here, I'm someone who knows this about myself.  Hell, I've even had folks in guild type settings complain about it.  For me, I'm old school.  The mark of a good RPer is someone who gives their partner in that scene a lot to work with.  \n\nIf you're talking about someone who just sends you 5 paragraphs of what their character is thinking, THAT'S a bad RPer.  Or if it's someone who doesn't know how to break up text into manageable paragraphs.  But just someone who types a lot?  That's just a different RPer.  And it's unrealistic to expect someone with a different style to psychically know if you're bothered by it or not.  \n\nPersonally, give me a 5 paragraph person over these 3 lines of nothing to respond to any day.   I'll happily trade.   And if my partner isn't saying much, I'll usually assume it's because I need to give them more to work with and I'll add more in the hopes that I can help them out in that area.  \n\nA lot of what you're typing here seems like you aren't trying to look at this from any lens other than your own.  Or you're looking at like the person on the other side is thinking the same way you are.  Humans don't work that way.  Give them feedback, or be upfront about what your needs are.  If they're still giving you the opposite of what you need after that, THEN they're a bad RPer.",
