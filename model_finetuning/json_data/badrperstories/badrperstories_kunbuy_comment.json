If I got anything wrong, I am sorry.\n\nSo, this jump in logic that you mention seems to be just this person realizing that you two don't really have much to talk about ooc (because you replied to their statements in a manner that implies that you don't share the same interests) so he jumps straight to talking about roleplaying instead. I don't see anything wrong with this, it is basically a  way of saying 'So what do you like when it comes to roleplaying?' and changing the topic so there isn't an awkward silence or forced ooc chatting when in reality, both of you are not interested in that. Really, nothing about that implies that this person might \n\nbe a narcissist.\n\nAnd to be honest, your use of emojis and the phrase  \u201cbecause right now that\u2019s not me, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca6\u201d come across as rather passive aggressive as well. I think that this is just an example of people that really don't share the same way of communicating and therefore, there are a lot of misunderstandings and interpreting stuff the other part never wanted to imply.\n\nStill, just blocking you was a dick move. But if you thought that he was pretentious and passive aggressive, it is probably better this way.",

Did you make it clear that you aren't able to be super active/provide frequent responses? Did you just leave them hanging mid-plotting for 12 hours? Perhaps he perceived your response to him and the prolonged silence as passive-aggressive and thought that you're dicking around with his time. Now was he a dick for blocking? Sure. But this probably could've been avoided to begin with if you didn't click from the jump. Why bother with someone you view as pretentious and narcissistic?",

The emojis don't really explain anything either, I'm not sure why you keep reiterating that and expecting them to interpret it- I've never actually seen those two emojis like that haha. I would've just said 'hey, how active a partner are you looking for? My usual rate is about X replies a week', as opposed to eyes and raindrops. Or sweatdrops, idk.
