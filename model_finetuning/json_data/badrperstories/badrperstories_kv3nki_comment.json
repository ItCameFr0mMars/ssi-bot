            "body": "I can relate. RPing is how I escape from reality and cope with stress. However, much like with every hobby, there are drawbacks you just have to cope with, and with RP, it's ghosting. Whether group or 1x1 it doesn't matter where you look. They're endemic to the community and very common. \n\nWhen you don't do anything wrong and get ghosted over and over by people who can't bring themselves to tell you that they don't feel like playing, yeah, I can understand why some would have a negative opinion of the RP community. I know, because I've been there. I've been painstaking in my efforts to be a pleasant, active, respectful and reliable partner, and often, it's not enough. If people aren't vibing with the RP, it's very likely they will ghost no matter what you do.\n\nThat said, what I can say is that good people are out there. I've met a few partners who've stuck with me long term. They're not around every day (far from it!) but I know with confidence that they will be back eventually, and that's always worth waiting for. Honestly the one thing that floored me the most in 2020 was when an RP partner poofed for two weeks, then contacted me explaining how they weren't in the mood to write with what was going on in real life, but affirmed that they were still interested in the RP. \n\nAnd I appreciated it a lot. More than words can describe. This is extremely rare in my experience, but to me, it's a show of respect and consideration, especially since they did actually keep in touch. \n\nThe question of whether you owe people online your time depends on who you ask, but honestly, I believe we do owe one thing to our partners: BASIC RESPECT. Yes, we've never seen them, never heard their voice and do not know their real names... but they're still human beings and they have feelings.",

It came out of nowhere and I was really shocked so yes, it did feel like a loss each time and I was looking for people to distract me and kinda fill a space so I wouldn't have to grieve. Not saying it was the best thing to do but I clung to the first thing I thought would help. While I agree that you do owe them common courtesy, I also agree that I wouldn't have been able to get far with these people if they think that way. So thank you for saying that.\n\nBut yeah I'm taking me time. It really wasn't something I cared about before so I will get back to that point soon enough.",
