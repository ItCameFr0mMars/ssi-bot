            "body": "This reminds me of something I had happen on tumblr too. I was mutuals with someone who said they wanted to write with me, but then never made any attempt to do so. After a couple weeks they unfollowed, which was fine, I assumed they changed their mind. A few days later I unfollowed them too (I only follow mutuals), and they almost immediately refollowed and messaged me saying their unfollow was an accident, and that they still wanted to write. I said okay and refollowed them.\n\nThey still never tried to write with me. They would post about plots they wanted to do with a certain character (the one I RPed), but would never ask me if I was interested in any of them. Even made passive aggressive \"I guess I'm never going to get to write with this character\" posts *about the character I was writing* instead of just asking to RP with me. Like they were expecting me (or the other people writing that canon) to initiate everything. \n\nEventually they unfollowed again. I kept following them in case it had been another \"accident,\" but after a couple weeks I unfollowed. Within *minutes* they were vague posting about me, upset that I unfollowed them and how they \"knew I'd never want to write with them\" and I just. Dude. You never reached out. You unfollowed me first (twice!) The fact that they were keeping that close of a watch on me *weeks* after they stopped following me was creepy. It felt like they just cared about keeping me around as a number on their follower count.",

Everyone wants to rp with you, follows you, contacts you to plot, and when you respond, they never speak to you again. Then they get annoyed when you unfollow or softblock. They also have a really bad problem with vague posting and 'calling people out' over bullshit reasons.\n\nCase in point: someone once called a person out for sending them too many pictures via DM's. Yup. That's right. His issue was the person sent him too many pictures. Instead of asking the person to stop sending them so many pictures, they made a huge callout about what a 'horrible experience' they were having with the person who runs the blog, posted their blog name, shit talked them, tried to make them out to be a horrible person, then complained about it when other people were sending them anon messages calling them a complete cry baby. Almost everyone is legit trash there.",
