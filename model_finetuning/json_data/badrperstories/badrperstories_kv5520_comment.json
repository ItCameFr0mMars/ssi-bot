Having squicks and limits is an important part of healthy RP partnerships.\n\nHowever\n\n&gt;This is completely unhealthy!  Chloe has told me that both characters should be traumatized by what has  happened, and that **Mary probably shipped them because it was F/F.** \n\nIs a little shitty, IMO. \n\nYes, these relationship dynamics are unhealthy. *In real life.* In fiction, who *cares*? Like, are you gonna stress out about all of the damage that these monster-possessed characters have caused? If they killed someone in the fiction, are you uncomfortable with that as well because killing people IRL is wrong? \n\nShould the characters be traumatized? Maybe? But at the same time, the characters are *imaginary* and you can do whatever you like with them. They're like barbie dolls, who don't care if you cut their hair off because they are not living, sentient people. \n\nIt's fine to be squicked out by it. But you both took it a step farther and started passing judgments about Mary as *a real, living person*, is what it looks like.\n\nAnd that's infinitely more harmful than whatever goes on in the imaginary playspace of RP.",
