            "body": "Honestly, a big rule of thumb I've developed over so much exposure to the \"threats to self\" type of incidents is that 99% of the time it's for manipulation purposes, and only about half of them or less would actually do anything to themselves because the end goal isn't to harm, it's to garner attention and \"win\". If they use self harm to try and get you to do something, it's better to assume they won't and call them out. As horrible as it sounds, you are not responsible for how they handle things or the actions they take, especially over something so mundane and ridiculous as roleplay.\n\nIn cases where they've mentioned self harm outside of the roleplay context, as in they do have a history of it but it's not set off in relation to responsiveness in a chat, I'm much more cautious because it feels more legitimate.\n\nBut in those cases where they DO hurt themselves BECAUSE of the lack of attention and yielding to their demands, I count them as too unstable to be having such activities and recommend they seek help, because I will not cater to that behavior. Hurting themselves will not make me want to reply any faster, it will make me drop the chat entirely to focus on getting them help and if that's not what they want then I begin to doubt they actually hurt themselves and didn't just find a picture on google or something.\n\nIt's a slippery slope of broken glass and tetanus, but that's my observations of situations and anecdotes. As I said, if they threaten to hurt themselves for a roleplay, they're probably full of shit and banking in your sympathy, or should probably be hospitalized for mental problems that have been unaddressed.\n\nNone of it is your fault or responsibility and people like that make those that truly suffer look and feel awful for their own issues.",
