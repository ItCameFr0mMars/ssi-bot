A seventy year old war veteran probably won\u2019t allow himself to become overwhelmed to the point of an attack whereas a soldier who just lost his leg will probs be very vulnerable.\n\nYes, I\u2019m aware how ptsd works and how it\u2019s often over dramatised in media and rping but at the same time, there\u2019s people who don\u2019t want a fight scene to end in death because their character had an attack and the other character didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIrl people hide their problems no matter how obvious. A character with ptsd will probably do the same.\n\nNot only that but unless there\u2019s a purpose in the story for it happening, a ptsd attack may very well just be a couple of scenes in the story.",

Even mainstream information on the internet concerning these illnesses is so often incorrect or has important aspects missing. I think including this just to make a character more 'interesting' and different will backfire in many cases, because the character will end up being more unrealistic than before.\n\nLike, if someone is really interested in portraying a mental illness, that is fine, they will do their research on their own. But like you noticed, even 'common' mental health problems like social anxiety and depression are often written incorrectly or the mental illness only appears in specific situations to cause drama.\n\n A lot of times, pressure, even if it is just people saying that some mental illnesses are overused (honestly, I have rarely encountered a well-written character character with social anxiety or depression, so that alone would be interesting enough for me) or that others have to think outside the box,  will create even more people who only use this as an 'interesting' character trait to make their character more special, and not as a way to correctly explore a mental illness in writing or  by people who really see it as serious thing that has to be handled with care and not just a interesting plotline.",

Nach makes a good point about misinformation. And there's so much diversity even within the same spectrum of an illness which makes accurate portrayal even more tricky. But media could care less if it represents something correctly and you can bet a lot of people who roleplay consume media, a lot of which, can be fairly problematic and that shows through characterization for sure. It's why we have a bunch of people running around wanting to be Insane Anime Boy or a Broken Wearwoof and so on.

            "body": "I have complex feelings on this issue as someone with cptsd... pun intended. \n\nI don\u2019t think most role players do a great job at researching mental Illness or sometimes have a surface level understanding of how symptoms present. I also think mental illness gets glorified a lot in rps as a plot device. I think literarily I agree that it does give characters who have been through traumatic events an element of realism BUT-\n\nWhen I tell you I literally did not know I had cptsd for the majority of my life I mean it. I was extremely high functioning and sometimes that\u2019s how it is for people. It\u2019s not this like... big thing because life doesn\u2019t really stop for your mental Illness. It wasn\u2019t until much later in my life did I even realize how bad off I actually was. \n\nSo yeah I agree people don\u2019t do it well BUT I disagree in that they probably shouldn\u2019t have characters that have these issues because 9/10 they are not portrayed in the way that is very real and impactful for people who have those issues. People who actually have a good understanding of those mental health issues I am entirely fine with and think it can be an invaluable outlet to work through some of the feelings attached to it with a trusted partner.\n\nGuess I\u2019m very back and forth on it!",

            "body": "And in my experience, many people who took pride in writing 'realistic' character with mental health issues just checked every box on some online test, which resulted in characters who would display every single symptom of a mental health problem in the most obvious way, which is rarely the case in real life. \n\nIn a way, I think that people have to keep in mind that the more influence a mental illness in their characters life has the more likely it is that this character deserves a different story that has a focus on this. For a 1x1 roleplay with someone who is interested in exploring this stuff, this can be great! \n\nBut in a group roleplay, it can severly limit the ways in which your character can be integrated in the story. For example, if your character has severe social anxiety and almost everything induces a panic attack, this can be well written when it comes to describing mental illness. \n\nBut I think it is on the writer to realise that this character would be unrealistic in a group roleplay where all characters are supposed to be people who have to deal with their triggers each and every day (for example an action setting where they are supposed to be part of a team), and that most people didn't join that story to comfort someone elses character all the time.",

And not everyone who goes through a traumatic situation experiences ptsd. A lot of people I worked with didn't get it. Some did. And triggers can be super unpredictable and really detrimental to plots, tbh. If your character has a twenty minute panic attack every time they hear paper crinkling, there can't be much forward movement.   \n\n\nNot to mention, many things can be overcome. I used to be super triggered by developmentally disabled people, but through exposure, I can enjoy their company again.

            "body": "I have noticed another issue that may contribute to your issue. People dislike role-playing aside damaged characters. Rather they call it babysitting or just dislike the in ability to reason with the damaged character on occasion, most people will just ghost. \n\nI have a character I like to play in star wars roleplays, his name is J\u00e6 Lynn (pronounced Jay) and he has some aggressive PTSD. I've put in the work to ensure that it isn't just a character with occasional flashbacks. You see, J\u00e6 was a Jedi padawan during the clone wars and fought on Umbara. For those who don't know, Umbara is a planet in perpetual darkness. J\u00e6, on top of intense flashbacks, always has at least one light on to avoid the dark and he even sleeps, well when he can, with a night light. Heck, the guy let's his eyes dry out simply to avoid blinking. \n\nDepending on the era, these symptoms range in intensity. During the clone wars, they are at their worst and J\u00e6 can't even hold a lightsaber and has joined the Agricultural Corp. so he'll never see combat again. Post order 66, he was seduced into becoming an inquisitor with promises of being able to reclaim his life and begins to fall into self destructive habits. Around the time of A New Hope, he is recovering and simply wishes to tend to his plants but is eventually pushed into the rebellion and actually confronts his trauma learning to manage it and live a fulfilling life. In the grossness that is the sequel trilogy, he has his farm and even passes on his knowledge and techniques to a gray padawan of his own. \n\nI probably go extreme with it by making the character's personal arc about dealing with his PTSD but I find it as a good source of story in smal details. Typically, I get ghosted or I am told to make a new character with him and I find that others have similar results with similar characters. At first, I tried to change how I ran him and I've done everything I know how to have others like him but no matter what, he is in my short list of characters that people don't like. I've been told by many people that they don't want to \"babysit\" him despite his independent nature so I think the issue has something to do with what people want out of roleplay. Rarely, am I told to stop playing one of my imperial characters, some of which are extremely evil and, in servers where it's allowed, kill other characters yet they have scored me compliments and are generally welcomed.\n\nI figure it's one of two things. Either I'm just better at making compelling villains than heros, or J\u00e6 is held back by how others view a character with trauma. Perhaps, if I could find a server that is free of the oppression of fun and instead is geared toward entertainment, he could find a home but for now his bio is in stasis.",

It's when people use it for comic relief that annoys me... The quirky guy who talks to himself or the person who uses bipolar as an excuse to do whatever they want. \n\nMy favorite character Chani grew up in a highly abusive environment, further complicated by a brother who tried to save her only to fall prey to the cyclic abusive and the lure and power of control. The stress of trying to care for two sisters with a history of abusive and a new coping mechanism of alcoholism like his father leads to worsening treatment of his sister. He has rare moments of clarity which only spirals his self-loathing further and transferring that anger onto his sister. She's a sweetheart, but her mannerisms are from a conditioned environment of trying to please her brother, chasing after the elusive affection she was deprived of as a child. She's glaringly apologetic with an anxiety that was born from fear of mistakes and disapproval. Everything is her fault, even when it isn't. Rules are comfort and freedom of choice terrifying. I recognize she isn't everyone's cup of tea and I absolutely am transparent in ads and her profile just how brainwashed she is and how compete the control her brother has. He is her God. I adore her and the transformation over long rps I've seen. So many wonderful directions that I love to see where the next one takes her.",
