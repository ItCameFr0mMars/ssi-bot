            "body": "I talked about this recently with on long term RP partner. I am so afraid to lose her (due to freak accidents or something) because with relatives, they are just a part of your life, you know? Sometimes big important parts, but still largely an outside thing. But a long term partner is someone you can explore the worlds inside your head with. They say that there are universes inside us all, and in the real world, you can bond with someone without ever really seeing or exploring that. But your RP partner sees them and even shares them. It's a source of validation that's really like no other. I'm happily married and all and still think it really is a special bond.\n\nSo I get it. I don't know how to fix it for you, but I'm here to say that it's valid and real and okay to mourn.",

            "body": "I've been there. It sucks. But it does get easier. And perspective helps. A couple months into the pandemic, I was going at the RP pretty hot and heavy. Found an amazing partner and all we did was write our COVID anxieties away and delve into our fantasy world. Back then, I would've been devastated if she bailed. She disappeared for about a week (got sick -- not COVID, thankfully) and it was rough, and I remember feeling exactly like you feel now -- like this wonderful shared world we had created was just gone. Like I was one of the kids who couldn't go to Narnia anymore!\n\nBut now, about a year in, *I'm* the one who ended up bailing. This ongoing pandemic isolation has just left me feeling burned out, creatively, so we put our story on hold for a bit. Thankfully, she's very patient about it. So, like I said, perspective changes.\n\nAlso, take heart in the fact that, if you found *one* amazing partner, there's a chance you'll find another. I've been lucky enough to find several outstanding writers to craft stories with. I know it's hard to find them, but they're out there, lurking. It just takes time and patience (and answering or posting lots of ads!)\n\nYou might also consider a totally different RP. Something light and casual. Maybe a group RP on Discord or something. It can be tough when you're grieving the loss of a very specific thing, and nothing else will quite compare, so don't try to replace it -- just look for something totally different. Maybe stretch your comfort zone a bit.\n\nGood luck! It'll get better, though.",
