            "body": "I agree. I'm not comfortable telling people I roleplay as a hobby because I feel like there's such a negative stigma around it. I usually just say 'I'm in writing communities'. In most of my entire storylines, there may be just a couple NSFW scenes- I tend to write 90% plot and 10% smut.   \nThat's not to say there's anything wrong with anyone that likes ERP- I've done that too. I usually have a few roleplays going at one time, and maybe one of them is a bit heavy on the ERP, because I do enjoy it when done right. But I think the expectation that rp=nsfw is really unfortunate. I have some great rp friends that don't write nsfw at all, and they find it difficult to find partners for that reason.   \n\n\nI'm fine with people that like extravagant erotica, ERP, rping fantasties, furries, absolutely whatever. That's fine, you do you as long as it's not hurting anyone. But...yeah, that's not what roleplay is as a whole, for sure.",

            "body": "I was actually relatively recently on the adult side of the problem. A kid, the same age you were when you did it, lied about his age when asking me to rp with him. I did it, and rped with him for an extended period of time. There was no hints of the lie, and in fact he asked for very specific things I wouldn't have expected a kid to even know let alone ask for. We stopped our rps after a little over a month, some other drama happening in a public rp we were in that had no adult content caused us to drift apart. No big deal. It wasn't until about 3 months later I found out his real age and was disgusted. I was still in contact with him, we shared a friend group, so I just chalked it up to childish stupidity and didn't interact much with him. Until a couple months after that he banned me from a rp server, but changed his mind and let me back. Less than a month later he did it again and told our entire friendgroup that I'm a pedophile. I'm still really messed up over this, I wonder if when I'm talking to people if I'm being manipulative, I have a lot of friends younger than me (but still adults) and I wonder if I'm somehow grooming them or abusing them. I keep telling myself I can't be these things because people engaging in that stuff do it on purpose, but I've always had self esteem issues so I don't always believe myself. I may have psychologically damaged this kid on accident and that kills me. But this kid also psychologically damaged me. We aren't allowed to say that or think that as adults, though, because they are just kids and don't know any better. But am I just supposed to ignore what it has done to my mental health? File it under \"boys will be boys\"? It's not like I can talk to a professional about it without risking a visit by the cops. I'm handling it, sort of, and the kid supposedly \"forgave me\". I'm still in limited contact because of the places I hang out (this is all online, I do not know them irl) and things seem ok but I sometimes get upset thinking about it again. I wasn't willing to lose my friendgroup over it so we have a truce. But sometimes I think I am a terrible person for allowing it to happen. \n\nThe thing is, though, how can we verify? Ask for ID? There's no way in heck I would show that. I don't even show my face online outside one single old photo, let alone something so identifying. One site I was on once tried to verify people by asking questions about old school pop culture things that younger kids wouldn't know, but they can just Google it. Heck they can even fake the ID if they really wanted, it's a no win.\n\nAs a note, it is possible people familiar with who I am will see this and they will know this story. So if one of you do, I'm sorry. I've wanted to get this off my chest for awhile but didn't know how to say it. Maybe I should let it go and just rugsweep it, especially since most people would call me the villain, but it isn't as easy as all that.",

Hell, even on SFW sites, it's pretty easy to find NSFW RP if you know how to phrase your request. \n\nIt's really a shame that sites have had to change the way they operate because of a few bad acting teenagers, though. Yeah, I know we all *did* it, but when I was growing up the #1 rule was to NEVER drop the facade and let people know any personal details about yourself. Nowadays, teenagers online will come into any space (this is especially prevalent in fandoms IME) with the *expectation* that every adult there is responsible for their safety.

            "body": "This post is right on so many levels. As an adult in the fourth decade of living, I've followed online roleplay from almost the very beginning. Yes, when I was 14, it was cringeworthy and leaned much more (like absolutely everything when you're a teenager) on posturing and trying to attain some thrill. Pretty quickly though I moved into a more \"literate\" and novella style of one on one, and that dropped off a cliff. Now, of the five stories I have active, all are 1x1 and feature male/female leads (I myself being male and playing the same when it comes to my MCs) but only one has ever led to a sex scene. That's over well over a year playing with that partner, and definitely not where the story focused or stuck for too long. The times I've specifically sought something NSFW are extremely few and far between. For me, this is for several reasons. None are because I am personally put off by the practice.   \n\n\nI get it completely and don't judge on principal. Everyone does (or at least a solid majority of people) enjoy *some* sort of pornographic content, so who am I to say? In my personal life kink is totally welcomed and I get that there are different strokes. For some people, it might act as an outlet for things they could never experience safely in life that is relatively harmless.   \n\n\nWhere it gets problematic for me starts with the quality of writing. It makes absolute sense that someone trying to quickly get off isn't going to put the effort in that someone who gets off on the prose itself. That's not to say there aren't good smutty writers out there, but they definitely haven't popped up in my experience as being on offer. Mostly, when someone is pushy and insistent this be a certain percentage of play time (weird), it's a clear enough red flag and it is quickly followed by a long list of others that include maturity and behavioral issues.  \n\n\nI actually enjoy *writing*, not DnD, not a better, hotter avatar for myself. The creative exercise of what is in essence writing a book together with another person. In that way, if a story (an actual story, not a loose excuse for two characters to meet and have a one night stand) circled around a NSFW topic and examined it, I could see the appeal in even that.   \n\n\nGraphic depictions that we spend 50% or more of writing time though? When is the last time you read a book aside from a harlequin romance that goes like that? It's disruptive and can be strangely out of pace, or simply not make a lot of sense for characters to be doing while going through whatever other emotional upheaval, drama, or horrors. Maybe I'm a judgey a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*e, but I can only go by what I see, which is a good deal.  \n\n\nThen you come to the obvious issue with doing something that maintains a degree of anonymity. There's no way to know the person on the other side of the screen isn't a kid, another dude, or even someone with nefarious intent you'd rather not interact with. I think right back to myself as a teenager, all the stupid, dangerous things I did or ever lied about because I was trying to impress someone. It's a skin crawling thought to imagine having what you presume is an adult exchange with another adult, and finding out it isn't. No. Thanks.  \n\n\nAgree that it is unfortunate that grown adults have to be denied adult spaces or otherwise need to be in the mindset of watching their backs, but that seems to be the cost of doing business online with any sense of basic internet safety.",
