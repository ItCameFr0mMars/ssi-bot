            "body": "It's just a natural part of writing, honestly. I've never met a roleplayer who hasn't struggled with burnout or writer's block at some point. There's no one-size-fits-all way to deal with it because people are motivated to write by a bunch of different things depending on the individual. You might find something that helps you push through it and write something you like, or you might just have to let your partner know it'll take you a little bit to reply to them because you're dealing with writer's block. Good partners will understand!\n\nFor me, what helps most of the time is media. Whether that means finding a song that really helps me focus, or watching a movie with the canon/playby in it, or just something entirely new that's in the same vein (like watching a Western movie if I'm stuck on a post for an rp set in 1800s Montana). Coffee also helps a lot because ADHD brain focuses with caffeine. Occasionally I might get into writing one-shots or adding to Pinterest boards, dev stuff that will get me into the mindset of that specific character, plus writing anything can help get me to the next step of a post.\n\nHopefully one of those things might help you figure things out! Even if they don't, seriously, there's nothing wrong with letting a post sit for a little bit as long as you let your partner know you're taking a break. Sooner or later, a lightbulb moment usually shows up - and if not you can always make it up to your partner with your next post!",
