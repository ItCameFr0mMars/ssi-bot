Start setting up interaction in your starter if you want to prevent that. Have your character peek behind a bush and discover someone behind it or have them run into each other or a twig snaps and they think there's an enemy and draw their weapon only to realize it's just another person.

They need to do it on their own or they will ALWAYS do it in interactions. Also, that \u201crunning into them\u201d thing only works when they do a starter that doesn\u2019t involve sleeping or being in an obscure place. The twig snap thing only works if I watch their character in an obscure place, not when they watch mine. I can't just force them to break a twig and have my character hear it when they haven't done it in their starter, that's considered god-modding, which is not good rp etiquette.\n\nFor example, my character walks into a forest. It's a fantasy, she speaks to an angel girl (a npc I play), out loud she's with about finding demons to talk with on information about their world and another demon she was trying to find who messed with her. A former demon guy, I say former because the person got stripped away from their demon powers so now they're a regular \u201chuman\u201d. Instead of coming out to talk to them, he watches them in a bush for about 5 interactions before coming out when I had my character \u201cpractice\u201d out her magic in the same place he was hiding to force them out. I just hate having to force them to come out.\n\n(Fun fact, in this same rp scene, another person wanted to join but had their character up on a tree and sleeping, not caring about the talking and the loud sounds of magic exploding throughout the place. So they were ignored.)\n\nAnother time I have both of us meet a family member of my character who gets mad she goes off without telling them. When asked who she was with she mentions the former demon guy. Instead of him coming out...HE STILL WATCHES MY CHARACTER IN A HIDDEN PLACE. Since I played both her and her family member I was practically solo rping..until I forced them out by having the angel character say the former demon is with them right now.",

If you want to RP, then you need a character that can *interact* with others. It always annoyed me when there'd be the same dude lurking in the background of other RPs, just like eating a sandwich on a bench or doing pull ups in a tree, cause he \"isn't social\". And same dude would often complain that people weren't RPing with him. Well, you know what, that's because given the choice between Chatty Cathy and Antisocial Andy, we're all going to gravitate to Cathy because it's easier and more fun than it is trying to extract more than two words from Andy, who very clearly doesn't want anyone to talk to him ever.",

            "body": "I've noticed that there's often a tendency to start off scenes where folks' respective characters aren't even in the same room, or vicinity! This confused me at first, since I always thought the whole point of interactive writing was to, well, *interact*. But I've gotten starters where folks will just have some long, detailed description of what their character's up to, off on their own, with no way for mine to easily turn up. Like they'll be off in their house, planning out their day or whatever, so I can't just have my character lurking there like an intruder or something! I guess it's just to establish some back-story and sketch out the character, which is all well and good, but it took some getting used to. \n\nI think one of the most frustrating examples was a scenario I did where this young bride marries this rich, mysterious baron and arrives at the manor for the first time, and dude's not even home. I had her interact with servants, eat dinner, have a bath, then go exploring the house, and we were about 14 pages in before the hubby even comes home! And *then* what does he do? Greet the servants, eat dinner, then decide to go off to his room, and only happened to pass her in a hallway. So, 17 pages in before they even interacted. That's gotta be some kinda record!\n\nI've noticed that my focus on the interaction between characters has even colored my perception of books, and I'll get bored if I have to read too much solo/inner monologue stuff before another character shows up. It's so much more interesting to see characters talk and banter back and forth to get a feel for them -- both in roleplay and reading.",
