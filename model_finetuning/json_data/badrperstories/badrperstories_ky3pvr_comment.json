            "body": "I think it's mostly people's preference really, sort of like irl. It probably also has to do with the ability to write as the \"role\" they're not used to. As someone who plays as dominant characters most of the time, I've become accustomed to the role and I thoroughly enjoy writing it as well, but I will say it is always a pleasant surprise to find someone who doesn't expect my character to be a dom and for once be the squishy switch they can be as well. \n\nThe more mature the roleplayer, I believe the more willing they are about being flexible. If they just think a bottom is supposed to fit all into these neat categories...they are very wrong and probably very inexperienced.",

            "body": "I personally don't see an issue with it. I could imagine if it was a situation where people were writing a book to be published together and all their characters seemed to be one-trick-ponies; but RP is meant to be an escape, so I don't feel like it's my place to get upset over if their escape or their muse involves one specific trope. If I want to play with another type of trope, I just find another writing partner. I can keep both stories going without any issue.   \n\n\nI think that as long as the other person is upfront with me saying \"I like playing these specific character types and dynamics\" and \"I don't like playing characters that are like this,\" then I have no right or reason to complain. There's so many other great writers out there, I don't feel a need to force one to play every possible dynamic or trope with me. Similarly, I know what I like to write and what I don't. If that doesn't work for my partner, that's fine and we can part ways.   \n\n\nIt's great that you're so versatile, but that doesn't mean everyone else needs to be or that there's anything inherently wrong with people who are not.",

Since I make no attempt to seek out people who prefer one dynamic entirely, I typically don\u2019t have these issues. Although I\u2019ve come to notice that when I meet someone who doesn\u2019t state what they like, and I tell them what I prefer, and they say they\u2019re alright with it and THEN get upset down the road when I ask if we could change things up, that\u2019s what really boggles my mind.\n\nUsually I just... thank them for their time and say I\u2019m not interested anymore. I had someone who, upon me asking to play the opposite role, got so upset that they blocked me and made a call out post on twt saying I was manipulative into making them believe they could play the same role repeatedly. Luckily, it gained no traction because they had 2 or 3 followers lmao, but it really rubbed me the wrong way because they had agreed previously that the switch dynamics were okay then backtracked on their word.\n\nI think I get myself tangled up with people who aren\u2019t very upfront with me and tend to just agree to my own conditions, then get offended later on despite them not telling me what they truly wanted. x:",

I'm a girl who plays mostly submissive characters, but that doesn't mean it isn't my responsibility to give creative story tangents.

For example for me, I wouldn't feel comfortable playing a dominant kind cause that's not something I personally feel okay with with. There are plenty of reasons as to not, even if I've tried before.

I used to be like you, a people pleaser who tried to switch so I could get what I wanted half the time, but then I came to a realization after getting burned out on that:\n\nLife\u2019s too short, and I\u2019m not going to waste my time writing something that\u2019s a chore for me, when I could use that same time for one of my other hobbies in between writing for RPs I do enjoy. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been hard-set in my preference.\n\nDoes this turn people off? Yeah. Is it marginally harder to find RP partners? Yeah. Have a few dipshits gotten really passive-aggressive with me before with no intent to even roleplay because seeing me advertise my preference in my thread made them so mad? Yes, and I now have a wall of shame for these exact interactions in my threads. \n\nIf someone is doing a bait and switch with you after you\u2019ve already started the RP, that\u2019s shitty; I won\u2019t argue that. But aside from that, people are just going to always have preferences. Not much you can do about it.",
