Her character ended up being clingy and always tried to save my character, so I said no. She got annoyed and kept saying how her character belongs with mine, which made me super uncomfortable. My character ended up being shipped with another girl character, making her jealous as hell. Bonus points for her character being a Mary Sue. \n\nHappier story... I made another teen male character. Another writer had just made a girl character, and we agreed that the two have been friends for years. They had some good interactions, then we decided that they should be a couple.

I had one  just recently who kept attempting to manipulate my character into being in a deep, timeless, soulmate relationship with them and I only knew the writer for *two months*. I had to keep reminding her that my character had deep psychological issues with love and affection that stemmed from childhood all the way through his adult life (canon, too) and that things like cuddling, holding hands, and PDA made him highly uncomfortable.\n\nHer response?\n\nGet angry and cry when he wouldn't cuddle her, get angry and cry when he wouldn't hold her hand in public, get angry and cry when he wasn't always showing PDA. Then get into arguments with him and when he'd have no choice but to tell her the truth about how selfish she was for forcing him to do things he couldn't physically do, she'd have her character attempt suicide or pass out on him so he'd have to take her to the hospital and be forced to stay with her.",

Nobody wrote very long or good but it was okay for what it was (I was a bit surprised that they were all my age tho, because they had some serious grammatically mistakes going on in our first language. But that is another story). \nSo I join the rp and make an OC. I used a dress up game to create my character, photoshopped it a little so she would look more...like characters from the show. Someone immediatelly comments that they like my character and I think nothing of it but that it is really nice of them to say so.\nThe roleplay starts and my character meets the character of the other person. They have a little talk and decide to hang out. I should have realised where this was going but I didn't for some reason. \nSo they got some tea and suddenly his character insists to pay for my character, my character says no many times and after he still does it without her being okay with it she just leaves and continues to hang out with other characters. \nSo far, so bad...I talked OOC to a few people and was like \u201cHey, nothing is happening. I could set up some drama and sidecharacters your OCs could fight\u201c and they all agree. They weren't really evil, but some rude thiefes, that also happened to have some bending powers. So they fought them. Nothing could go wrong here, right? \nThe person from earlier decides that his OC should brutally murder everyone of them after the fight is allready over. My OC sees it and of course she wouldn't like people that are like this. \nHe on the other hand is really surprised about her negative reaction and continues to try to win her heart during the roleplay even when she makes it very clear that she doesn't like his. Also we spoke about this OOC and I told him there that his character has no chance to come together with her.\nThe worst part was that the other characters of the other people started to ship us, so I also disappointed them by not letting his character end up with mine.\nI only got out of it when another girl character became part of the roleplay and he was busy trying to win her heart.",

There are people who genuinely forget, and they just apologize and carry on with the rp as originally agreed upon.  I know you're lying because you try to get me to do it anyway.  Note: It's worse when you think you're being subtle about it.  You're not.\n\nPartners who seem great and normal until you start getting into the romance.  That's the moment they want to know more about you ooc and you can tell that they're kind of hitting on you through rping romance with your character.  Again, they're not as subtle as they think.\n\nPeople agreeing to keep romance as just one small aspect of the roleplay, but then completely shift focus to it once it's established.  A small honeymoon period is understandable, but we still need to go stab some monsters.\n\nMy current problem is a little different.

If we discuss a plot-line and we also discuss that it's **ALL AU**, I don't want to hear about why Bob isn't reacting to Susan in our canon plot-line like how he did in the AU. \n2. People who get weird OOC when writing romance in general. I mean, I get that emotions are involved etc, but homie, me writing the guy or girl or whoever does *NOT* make me your irl romantic partner, and if you're feeling that way, you need to take a few night classes on the differences between IC and OOC. \n3. People who blatantly make their characters do things in the hopes that it will appeal to your character more. Miniature story time. Me and an ex-writing partner was doing this and i hoped that she would stop with a bit of light 'hey, can you not be this person'  We were discussing an argument our characters were in because lolol 'my guy was crushing on some other girl at a table they were all at and writing partners character started doing the whole weird jealousy out of nowhere, glaring at my guy, storming off thing etc. Context of convo was You know, why they're mad, how it's generally going to go etc. She asks what calms mine down and I say 'oh you know, he's not real good with tears in certain situations' for example. We go to write the thread and suddenly her character is weeping and suddenly so sorry about the thing that blew up the situation to begin with, but she, ooc is confused as to why my guy is still pissed and not wanting to deal with her character anymore. \n4. People who seemingly can't come up with stuff on their own and completely mirror your entire post as a reply to you, but are doubly confused/disappointed when the thread falls off or people decline to write with them based on this. If you want to write romance, lets write it. Don't say 'oh yeah, I want to write romance' but then leave it to the other party to advance the storyline. HATE. THIS SHIT. Read fic if you're looking for a specific storyline you don't plan on contributing to. \n5. People who take IC actions as OOC slights. My guy character isn't impressed with yours? Oh that MUST mean I personally don't like you etc etc. My character is crushing on a character that isn't written by you, this is the perfect opportunity to act like a lunatic about it OOCly because that's definitely a way to get me to keep writing with you. \n6. The 'Rules for thee but not for me' crowd. My guy can cheat all over the place and it should be fine because partner doesn't know about it, but partner better not even have the silent thought of doing so otherwise, we're going to lose our minds. \n7. Stop presenting me with the coffee shop au of slow burn goodness when you know it's only going to turn into smut hour. we can write that, but don't present it as some other fucking thing. gd.",

            "body": "I think my biggest pet peeve is when the other person starts blurring the lines between rp and rl once your characters get into a romantic relationship or are close to it in the story. I've had one instance where someone began taking things that happened in the roleplay too personally and would get offended at the stupidest things after we both considered hooking our characters up. Another person started treating me as if I were the character and became dependent on me being online whenever they were. When I wasn't, like when I had to step away for a few days every once in a while, they got easily depressed and complained to our friends about how much they missed me and needed me and how I was their whole world. Another time I had someone start nitpicking every time I sent a post because my character had no (current) interest in hooking up with theirs.\n\nI'm also a fan of slow burn and letting a romantic relationship develop gradually through the story. I roleplayed with an individual for over a year before we finally let our characters hook up and that was because they had spent so much time together, been through so much together, and our story had progressed so far. We didn't even have to talk about it, it just happened, and I would love to find another writing partner like that again someday. But many people either go into a roleplay expecting the characters to hook up or think they should after spending a short amount of time together. And then either blow you off or get upset because your characters aren't getting together when THEY want.\n\nBecause of these two things, I've become a stickler and highly picky for who my characters get into relationships with.",
