My advice to learn new turns of phrases and descriptive techniques is to read erotica. Fanfiction works! Archive of Our Own has a lot of it you can obviously read for free. This way you\u2019re not borrowing from your partners, so it feels fresh not just for you but for them.",

            "body": "First of all, I'd like to commend you for writing this post better than most native English speakers.\n\nI've been in the same position as you, in the sense I was focused more on erotica than plot-based roleplays for a while and I did get tired of the whole process for some time. My writing eventually evolved, focusing how each of my characters went about these scenes. Of course there's the physical aspect to these types of roleplays, but adding a metal perspective could really lure your partner in and it gives an opportunity for you to learn about your character's thought process through these moments. \n\nWhat type of character is being used can play a part of how to go about it as well. Are they the shy personality who actually likes to take control in these instances, a switch who likes to give and receive, a dom who has a knack of using toys? That being said, a change of pace may help make you appreciate the roleplay. Of course, if you go this route COMMUNICATION is absolutely important. Just like in real life, consent is the most important part. \n\nI know SFW isn't your cup of tea, but that doesn't mean mixing in different genres can deter it away from erotica. The environment, the characters, and maybe the situation may build up to could add a bit of flair. Personally, a build-up to that moment makes the scene that much sweeter and worth it.\n\nHope this helps!",
