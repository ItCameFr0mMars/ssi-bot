            "body": "It's hard to make anything 100% original anymore. Many writers borrow from each other. Even irl, a lot of people look alike and have similar histories. I've known people who've made OCs that look and act exactly like a character from a fandom they've never heard of before or even made an OC before the canon look-alike came around. Every character is made up of tropes and sometimes the same set of tropes gets reused. Color pallets get reused, names aren't always as unique as we think they are, a combo of tropes, looks and backstory you thought of could have been made by someone else on the other side of the world years ago. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there is a TON of character plagiarism around the world, but not every single character that seems similar was done so purposefully. When it is done on purpose, it's usually just idiotic laziness and trying to get fame off other peoples' work. Not much else to it.\n\nAlso sometimes recolors are made or faceclaims used because the person can't draw and can't afford a good artist that has open slots. It's hard to tell nowadays and as much as I'd love to destroy copycats and plagiarizers, we don't know 100% what's going on inside their heads. I don't usually give the benefit of the doubt, but at the same time, I know we shouldn't just condemn someone right off the bat for something that could be coincidence. I usually just ignore the person or talk about it with my friends. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to not give them attention if you believe they are a thief because attention is what the thieves want. Most of the time, it's just a dumb kid trying to figure out how to create characters and will eventually learn to do better. Not all of them, but some will eventually learn as they grow.",

His name is Oliver (Ollie) Constantine, he's John Constantine's son.  He's pretty similar to John, mostly in looks. He has blonde hair naturally, but he does dye it later (mostly a teenage rebellion thing but) and his eyes are blue. He wears a black trenchcoat, plus he smokes too. Though his personality is a good bit different, he's a lot more open and compassionate openly to others. He is a little naive, he just wants to help everyone he can. Currently, in a roleplay, he's trying to help the persons' OC who's in a crime organization, though he doesn't know much about this organization. I know I could develop him more, which is what I'm trying to do, but I adore him so much-",
