Could be completely unrelated to RP, even, and have nothing to do with you. \n\nOne of the things I struggle with RPing is that I deal with a lot of burn out in my daily life due to struggles related to work, mental health, etc. Sometimes I have a lot of enthusiasm for writing, other times just coming up with a paragraph is difficult, sometimes I have to take a few days off an RP because I'm just not feeling any creative juices. If one of my pals sent me a 16 paragraph document, I'd try to read it, but mustering up a great deal of enthusiasm about *anything* gets hard sometimes, you know? \n\nI'd suggest you branch out and find other RP partners to help you scratch the writing and RPing itch. Someone with the time and energy to squee with you over large paragraphs of writing, discuss detailed concepts for characters, and engage in the occasional flurries of back and forth RP. Let your slower long-time RP continue to simmer in the background if that makes you happy, but make new connections and let them take up the bulk of your time.",
