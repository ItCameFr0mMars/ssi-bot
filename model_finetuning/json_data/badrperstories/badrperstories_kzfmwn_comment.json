This honestly has bothered me sinc ei started your post. I understand that it's background lore and in the background and that nobody has to act upon it, but isn't the sole job of background lore to set the scene and help players decide on their character and develop some.plans for an arc? \nFrom my experience the background lore is the spine of an rp, even if it's open world and kind of necessary to be known to eveey player in basic terms.",

The \"friends\" did that. They expected you to be an all knowledge god of fantasy of a special brew they made up themselves and nominated sectorial coinnesseurs of. For instance Fox was all about magic, Snake was about vampires and hybrids, Falcon Demons. \n\nYou had to do some weird ass \"tutorage\" of shooting in the dark without being able to write your own stuff, despite there was no rule about magic or stuff but if you didn't conform their view, well, you're wrong and they would totally tell you. Like. A lot. Without telling you the whole deal. Or their lore source.\n\nAnd the fact everyone gets to be a god beside you is still a box fitted by friends. You are unable to have humans, they can have the egyptian gods heritage because access to lore and cool.\nIt creates a situation totally dreadful for anyone who is an everyman as character because you know from that point on that you are under superman's rule. At some point one may want to accomplish something or evolve? Or even interact? Well. Nope. You are not superman because you don't get to play with the big guys.\n\nSo either I am a gummy bear, either you are cool. I think you are cool and that's not your fault at all",

There are archmages out there, that fight with super sayans and metal mech. You can't consider them fine while trying to balance a crew of time travelers, that's just hypocrisy.\n\nHonestly I am iffy ehen someone gangs up a tons of characters together to create bigger forces of power. In magic fantasy usually it turns out very bad as there are no other forces able to fend the badass team off most of the times, and the characters in this badass group turn out to be the worst munchkins in existance making the team unbeatable... And ruling the RP. One of the most dreadful tropes I ever seen, I hate when a rp server becomes a game of Civilization (basically one group sets to control the whole world of game. It's not cool. Seriously do not try. Please)\n\nHowever what you speak about is a group of timetravelers stranded and trying to survive, not rule the world or the universe or whatever. They should have allowed that. Perhaps it could have been a good story, the owner could have just played along and create multiple dangerous odds for this group of humans with tools. Perhaps emp stuff, or whatever one can think of. That server wasn't balanced but broken. It's not that one simple person makes the whole to unbalanced.",

When the setting is dreadful and dead, it kills motivation.\n\nI always prefer quality over quantity of places, as it is better to settle down a few inspiring place and shove inside them some lore and quest to do and wait for the players to take one of the baits you placed and start a quest...\n\nBesides that, even in magic there's a lot to research if one wants to do that and spend time besides flick hands and make stuff happen magically. Try to fiddle between natural laws and magic was a big topic in 1500. Alchemy and mages were a thing, they were scientists who figured out weird stuff. \nOne could try to give a look at elementals, science, or try to find cool tricks one could do with an element.",
