They left saying it was because they had IRL stuff going on, then they came back when they finally turned 18, and we found out. Even though by the time we found out, they were over 18, they had still lied and wrecked the trust of everyone they'd played with. We had to issue a ban.   \n\n\nI get that there are some amazing writers who are still minors, and they want to write in servers with adults because they want to write with mature people who match them. But I can't see it as anything other than entitlement. They're putting entire servers at risk, they're putting individual writers - people they consider their friends - at risk for a lie. And I can't get behind that. It's for everyone's safety. I don't and will never agree with people who lie and ignore someone else's boundaries just because they feel entitled to write with them.",
