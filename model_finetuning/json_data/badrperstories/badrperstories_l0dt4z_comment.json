That\u2019s not even a day, and messaging every 6 hours is a lot.  It\u2019s overwhelming and, honestly to me at least, it\u2019s worrisome.  Again, roleplay is FUN, it shouldn\u2019t feel like a job or a hassle.

A simple check in once every few days is fine if you haven't heard from them, but I would advise against pestering them numerous times throughout the day.

It might be \"I'm not interested\", but I will send a response. \n\nI get the frustration of feeling like 'why they are looking for more rp with an advertisement when they are drowning in rp and RL?'. I keep my partners low to make sure I am not stretched to my limits. I get that it feels like a waste of time and you're likely upset from the ghosting in rp or lack of replies to your inquiries. It's okay to be frustrated, but you're upset over someone who is clearly not a match for your preferred level of availability. \n\nPeople make the effort for things they want. Don't chase someone who doesn't. When someone stops communicating, I don't bother them. I move on and look for someone new. If they message again and I'm still interested, great. If they don't, I'm not wasting time waiting.",
