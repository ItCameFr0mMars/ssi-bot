I\u2019ve ended up doing 1x1 with the same partner for a few years now, and have found that to be the only thing that\u2019s kept me writing. But over the last 18 months my partner has slowly dropped the frequency in which they will respond, or even just communicate at all. Shit happens and we all have lives outside of writing in these beautiful worlds we make together, but fuck if it doesn\u2019t feel like little pieces of my soul are dying the further I get from my characters. If/when my partnership ends, I think that will be it for me and rping. I might try and follow your example, taking the world, plots, and characters and continuing on my own.
