IMO, first person feels icky, like a person who can't separate themselves from their character. \n\n&gt;I'm not gonna go on and on about my characters feelings about a dang pebble or trees, because yes while they're very neat, I don't wanna go on about it. \n\nUnless your partner's character is a mind reader, those thoughts and feelings aren't something they can reasonably respond to. So why include them? One of my top RP peeves is when people responding to character thoughts/feelings that aren't explicitly articulated with highly specific remarks. \n\n&gt;I love rping but I hate when it feels forced just to fill up to a paragraph.\n\nYah. I hate people who go on about how important *quantity* is to RP. IMO the real mark to hit is that every post you make gives your partner something they can respond to. Sometimes you need lots of description for a room or new scene or something. But you can have very engaging and interactive RPs with just a few lines of back and forth between each other.",

            "body": "I think I'm being nitpicky here, perhaps, but this complaint absolutely drives me bonkers. First-person writing does not absolve the writer from adding detail to their world. Writing about rocks, as you put it, is part of a good roleplay experience. Some of those little details help not only move the story along but also give it depth and quality.\n\nYou're right that quantity is meaningless, but once you start adding details, it no longer really matters how long your post is, I think. \n\nHere's an example from an RP I did a few years ago that stuck in my mind.\n\nThe other person wrote something like: \"I went to the park with &lt;My Character&gt; and we looked at the birds in the pond.\" It was basically something of this nature. It was a perfectly valid post and there was nothing *wrong* with it. But, it was so lacking in details that there was nothing for me to say beyond: yep, nice ducks.\n\nIt's the details that flesh out the world and make for good roleplay. Did you stumble on any rocks? What did the birds sound like? Did you smell the grass? Did you fiddle with your sweater? Are you even wearing clothes? (1st person writers tend to forget that their characters are dressed, for some reason, and often fail to mention attire.) Did you look at your partner? What was that like? Did you think anything? Did anything draw your attention? What existed in your world that you experienced? What thoughts came to mind?\n\nWhen writers answer some of those questions, and they totally can in first person view, they often construct much better posts than those that focus on action only. \n\nWriting in the first person puts you in the *head* of a character. By default, that is a very narrow perspective (often skewed because it's a single viewpoint) and it can be extremely effective when that character has a teeming internal life. I also find that first-person writing is slower paced. Less happens. The focus is not necessarily on progressing a plot, so much as developing and maintaining a character.\n\nThird person writing can go both ways. Omniscient narrators can know everything (and usually this isn't a much used thing in RP since the two writers can't generally read each other's mind). But even then, third person means access to the thoughts and minds of more characters, and it allows for quicker paced action. For some writers, this comes at the cost of character depth.\n\nGood writing in any perspective (first, third, second even if you've ever read Harrow the Ninth) is about the details. It's about the rocks!",

My issues are more so in the sense that the people I rped it with didn't like how I'd do it, or didn't like my characters reactions despite it being in their head. But the rps that involved the first person honestly didn't get much detail, Nor did the people who would do first person added much detail -besides how certain features on my characters looked-. I seen it used well and find it entertaining to read. But in rps for me I just can't work well with it I guess.

I have no issues with anyone using it with me as long as I can do third person. -In fact I have an rp where I'm using third and they're using first and I enjoy it- I suppose it just depends on the person and the fact I've had too many bad experiences with it.",

I don't plan on forcing anyone to write how they're uncomfortable writing. As long as they don't have an issue with me doing third person, they're more than welcome to write however they prefer. The whole point of rp is for you to enjoyment, its not really enjoyable if you have to write in a certain style that you generally have issues with.  \n\n\nBut I guess my whole view on rp is that both sides enjoy it I suppose. I remember I use to be terrible at it when I first started on it.",
