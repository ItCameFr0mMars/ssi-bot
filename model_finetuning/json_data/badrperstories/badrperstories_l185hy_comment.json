I'm personally not a fan of characters just meeting without some kind of excuse. I hate the typical, boring \"meeting\" where one character just stumbles across the other and strikes up a random conversation without any real excuse or substance. For me there needs to be a driving force or some incident that brings them together. Have you tried talking to the other guy about it? Communication is important when problems pop up in roleplay, especially early on. Now if he refuses to talk or try and work with you, then I'd say walk away from it.",

There's a thing in HP where you can actually look back at recent spells cast on the wand (in the books, idk about the movies it's been a hot minute, but it's how they condemned Sirius) so they'd be able to confirm the curse was cast. So OF COURSE if you have a psychopath trying to kill students and using highly illegal spells you'd immediately go to a teacher??? That's mainly what baffles me. That, and how the fuck is she up and walking? Or coherent? Cruciatus is what made Neville's parents go bonkers, so there's a lot of bullshit leaking off this girl",
