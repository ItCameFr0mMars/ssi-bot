Some will expect you to match in length, whereas others will want whatever feels best as a response.\n\nI usually try to give a reaction to what they wrote, along with a little more for them to react to. Any big ideas I throw out out of character so we can brainstorm it together or just get a thumbs up to continue with it. If you feel your scenes are lacking, try using characters senses to describe their surroundings, or something that triggers something from their memories. Those are always great ways to fill the space and develop your characters personality.",
