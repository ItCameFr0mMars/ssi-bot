Using a non-professional model's/normal person's pictures of themselves without their permission and pretty much impersonating them? He might get away with worse next time. These things need to be reported so they don't get worse. You might want to talk to the girl about pressing charges as it could possibly count as some sort of identity theft. If he had done something illegal online using that image, it could possibly be traced back to her and she could potentially get in trouble for his actions. \n\nOf course more would have to be looked into.\n\nI highly recommend looking into the laws (mostly the girl who's pictures were used) and seeing if any charges could be pressed before anything gets worse or he does it again with the same or another girl. \n\nThis is why you need to be so careful when posting pictures of yourself online.",

Personal details just aren't something worth giving out. It's incredibly dangerous. I even have felt nervous telling people the state I live in because you just never know.
