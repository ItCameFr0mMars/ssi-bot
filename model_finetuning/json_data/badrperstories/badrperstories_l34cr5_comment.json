You always get one person playing a self insert pretending to be a canon, or they completely rebrand them and take away any anything original, or turn them into a can-do-no-wrong overpowered Mary Sue. I'm lax about own character interpretations, but there's a line if it starts affecting how the roleplay is told and becomes all about them.\n\nSteve is a favorite of mine to play, so it hurt my heart to imagine him as a bully.
