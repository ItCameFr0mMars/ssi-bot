I have just gotten onto reddit in terms of looking for partners and already some I have started RPs with and politely had to decline further writing.

But maybe unexpected death is a greater fear during a pandemic?\n\nAnyway, yes, I totally agree. It's actually a bit mystifying to me that there's such an emphasis put on long-term roleplay, for all the reasons you cited. It *is* a lot like dating, and it takes a while to find a partner that you really mesh with -- not just in terms of the writing, but all the OOC chatting, brainstorming, plotting, steering the story, and so on. It's rare to find that perfect combo of qualities that make a good writing partner. \n\nAnd so often, I'm aghast by the BS folks will put up with as described here on BadRPerStories -- almost as though they feel like, if they'd committed to an RP, they *have* to stick with all sorts of bad behavior, guilt-tripping, catfishing, or just woefully inept writing. Like, dude, move on! If this were a dating scenario, there would *not* be a second date! But, nope, I answered an ad, so now we're locked together in an unholy matrimony of roleplay!\n\nI really wish short-term roleplay scenarios were more of a thing... outside of erotic encounters. Every time I do a search for short-term RP, it seems like all the ads are on DirtyPenPals. Which is fine -- not knocking that, but sometimes I just wanna give folks a \"test drive\" without having to go to pound town! ;) \n\nI feel like there should be some unspoken rule with new roleplay attempts. Like, we'll give each other 2 or 3 posts apiece, but if it doesn't quite click, let's just agree to go our separate ways: no muss, no fuss, no guilt. Who's with me?",

            "body": "I can see how intimidating those longterm rper posts can be. Its definitely a lot like dating when it comes to searching for someone you click with, I tend to accept most will end up being short-term or ghosting. The ones that make it past that are always appreciated, no matter how long an rp lasts.\n\nI have one writing partner who I've been role-playing with for about 6 years now. She's a church-goer and I'm the opposite of that, so our combination shouldn't have really worked by all accounts, but she's basically my online wife at this point.  She knows me better than most my family do. I game online with her husband sometimes.\n\nOur main ship has been with us since the beginning. It's been through multiple timelines, fandoms, and scenarios. Recently, our characters went through a separation. My character had an arranged marriage in a fantasy setting which sent her character into a destructive spiral. We had them go and try to get their memories of each other wiped, only for it to backfire and have new memories from all these other stories that we've done. It's been a wild ride but it always feels like home going back to writing a post with her. \n\nWe we can go weeks without replying to a post, but it's rare we go a day without talking or sending memes. Like any relationship created, the heartbreak will always be there if we stopped. Its always a risk we take when we get invested in something. I really can't imagine what it would take for our friendship to break down. Life comes first, so it's a relief to have someone who gets that and I feel reassured she will to be there when I get back from being busy. I do the same for her.\n\nI'm sorry you haven't had as much luck with long term partners. Having that comfortable connection with someone has been one of the reasons I continue this hobby. It reminds me its possible for writing partners to become real friends, and makes up for the slew of negative encounters that come up. I don't need to be close to someone or know the life of a person to write with them. Best part about writing for me is the stories we get to tell and all the different personalities we come across. Having it go long term is just a nice bonus.",

I myself have been writing with someone for about a year and a half now. But like you said, it is a little like dating. I actually have a rule on my RP blog that I highly prefer to do a couple smaller, casual RPs with someone first to see how we mesh before jumping into something big or long-term. I've had people who wanted a big, complex plot where every reply was like five+ paragraphs long as their very first RP with me and I couldn't do it. It's too much for a first thread when I don't know someone.\n\nI do feel there's a difference between someone hoping to find a long-term partner, and someone that requires a person commit to something long-term with them right off the bat (I'm not sure how common the latter is, but I've seen it a few times.) I had one experience where someone wanted to write with me, but they had a rule that anyone that wrote with them *had* to be exclusive to their character. Meaning if I agreed to RP, I wouldn't be \"allowed\" to RP with or follow anyone else that wrote that canon character. Which was such a huge red flag to me because how could I possibly know if I wanted to write with only their interpretation, without writing with them first? Similar feeling, though the exclusivity thing was much more extreme lol.",

I'm someone who really likes to develop stories and world's, and having all that potential thrown out just feels bad to me. Is it bad to think that way?\n\nMaybe I feel this way because me and my friend of 4 years ended up going seperate ways and ending our roleplay. I don't really know.
