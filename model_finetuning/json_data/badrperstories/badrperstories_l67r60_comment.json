            "body": "While it may have been a bit rough, if they had no indicators initially that they'd take a while then it's natural you would worry. Ghosting is not a rare occurrence nor is it a secret, so frankly if they think someone is just going to sit around and wait on them when they've made no effort to communicate the issue, then you probably dodged a bullet.\n\nIf they had initially said \"btw I have the xxxxxx and I might blink in and out\" or right away indicated \"because of something irl I can only answer once a day or every few days for a little while, sorry\" then I'd say yes, you may have overreacted.\n\nBut if they did none of that, it feels like they expected someone to be courteous when that courtesy hadn't been earned. Now, it's possible they agreed and THEN got sick or hurt right after and didn't get a chance to explain, but if that's the case then you still had every right to ask what was up, even if it was a bit aggro, it not like ghosting is rare. They should be aware of that if they've been partner hunting for any length of time, unless they're just super lucky or something.\n\nIf anything, at least explain the grievance again and that you thought they were ghosting and had already been ghosted numerous times. Apologize for any aggressive tone and ask if they do want to continue at this point or not. You either get a yes or a no and go from there.\n\nIf they're still fixated on \"it's only been two days\" then that's a flag to me because it shows they're hyper defensive and one of those people who operate on \"their time\" so if your ability to respond and reply doesn't match theirs you end up annoying them they'll probably drop you for it. Yes, it was only two days, but it was two days of what I assume is radio silence. That's grounds for ghosting and they should understand that because it could affect their partner searches in the future if they think they can go silent for days and still have someone they don't know waiting on them like a lonely puppy.",

            "body": "I am honest: I always get a bit weirded out if someone replies to questions about if they are available with something like that. Not because I question that they are sick. But because it always feels a little guilt-trippy if it is worded in a way that makes it seem that someone is an idiot or an asshole for simply asking about availability.\n\nI was often sick in the past, and if someone asked about it, I never used it against them in a 'shame on you, I was in the hospital' kind of way. Because there is no way they could know that if I never told them. I just apologized that there was no way to contact them and added something like 'I don't know when I will be available again, if you are still interested in writing with me regardless, I will contact you when I feel better.' \n\nI mean yes, if their illness just started for the first time, there are probably other things on their mind than roleplaying. But why mentioning the two days as if it was somehow your fault for not waiting longer? I guess I would have just written that I need time for myself and am unfortunately unable to start a new roleplay right now. They seem super defensive for some reason.\n\nEven if the problem had been that they are slower in planning (for example, some people only reply to their messages once a day and that is completely normal for them, while others expect you reply multiple times especially in the planning phase), it would have been way nicer if they just said 'Hey, I guess our post frequence does not match, I am more slow when it comes to planning and two days does not feel like a lot of time for me. Are you sure that this will work out regardless?'\n\nSo I don't see why you should be the asshole. A simple question if they are still available is not an asshole move in my opinion, unless they specified beforehand that they need more time to reply. And you couldn't know about their illness.",
