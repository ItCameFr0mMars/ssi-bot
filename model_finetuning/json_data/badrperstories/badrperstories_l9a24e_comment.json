Almost never will they actually input ideas of their own. Bonus points if they ghost right after the RP begins, implying that there was something that they wanted that they just didn't tell you about.\n\nA variant of this is the 'confusing/self-entitled brainstormer', who seems to play a game of \"guess who\" but for plots. These are more common if you're the one reaching out to them. \"Would you like this?\" \"No, it's not quite x enough\" \"What about this then?\" \"No, it's not quite Y enough.\" \"Hmm... What do you think would help make this work?\" \"You really aren't creative.\" (This is a paraphrasing of something that happened to me, legit)\n\n**The pleaser**\n\nThese people, while engaging in brainstorming and the creation of ideas, will agree to almost anything, even if they'll vocalize mild preferences. \"I would prefer X, but we can do Y too\". However, the truth is that these mild preferences are actually *major* deal breakers to them. If you don't catch on to this early on, this will lead to quick and inevitable ghosting. These people can be good partners, but they are hard to figure out.\n\n**The cold caller**\n\nThis person will PM you with an idea that suggests that they haven't even looked at your preferences or your ideas. They're likely sending the same mass request out to everyone, hoping that inevitably someone will agree to their idea.\n\n**The self-indulgent**\n\n\"Can you play multiple characters, use a dice system and generally control everything and set up everything and then have my relatively idle character play in your world?\"\n\nI'm self-indulgent, but these people are next level. It's of course something else if you're offering the above, but yeah. Bonus points if they aren't good writers.",

They send you an anonymous ask asking if you'd roleplay with them. Or they might say things like, \"I want to RP with you but I'm too shy to come off anon/am afraid you won't like me/don't think I'm any good,\" usually in hopes of you saying *I'm sure you're great, come off anon and we can plot!* Basically they hope you'll agree to RP with them before even knowing who they are or what character they play. Sometimes they turn out to be someone you've already turned down, haven't read your rules, or *have* read them but are planning to try making you compromise once they reveal themselves (speaking from personal experience.)\n\n**2. The one that's okay with not knowing the canon, and/or they expect you to fill them in.** When someone approaches you for fandom RP, but haven't consumed the source material and don't seem to have any plans to. Maybe they like the basic premise, or maybe they don't care about the canon at all, but they want to RP without putting in any effort to learn the story on their own. Often they expect you to handhold them the whole way and tell them everything yourself. You often end up having to do most of the work in the RP too, because they don't know that world well enough to write much detail outside of their own character's actions.\n\nIn one particular fandom, I keep getting people wanting to RP that either stopped watching the show seasons before my canon character showed up, or they never watched the show at all, but still want to RP with me without watching or researching any of it.",

So you tell your partner this plan and they agree.\n\nBut then, you create your character profiles, they say that they are finished, you take a look, and suddenly, the mother of their character was a great healer, too, and their character has inherited their power, on top of being a skilled sword fighter, fluent in six languages, and being the best magician in the land.\n\nAnd you asked yourself...why did your character want to travel with mine again?
