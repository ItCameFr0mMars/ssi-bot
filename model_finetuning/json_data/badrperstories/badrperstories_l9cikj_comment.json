            "body": "To me it sounds like you might not just be into rp anymore. It doesn't mean that you won't be in the future, but right now it just isn't your jam. \n\nIf you're feeling apathetic in all aspects of your life, it might be a spot of depression. If you aren't then maybe writing now that you're doing more of it with college is more akin to work than fun. I think breaks are fine, but to me it sounds like the break didn't help. \n\nI'd be completely honest with your partners. Tell them you've been struggling to be invested in the stories, but you can't find it and the last break didn't help. Reassure them it isn't them or anything they are doing. If you want to remain friends, suggest it only if you have the drive to be proactive of being social engaged with them. Like messaging them first, having the energy to talk about what is going on in their life, etc. \n\nThis needs to not be another break as it feels like without a reason or ends it just comes across as unintentionally stringing them along. I feel you need to stop the rp this time and let them go. If they are like me, they aren't finding new partners because they keep a partner limit so they don't spread themselves thin. If in the future, you get the urge, perhaps try less partners and maybe rp with a scenario rather than long-term with no specific end. Only get one and see how it goes.\n\nPeople change and sometimes so do their hobbies. You aren't a bad person for that, but how you handle it is where you can be. Don't ghost even if its uncomfortable. You said that they are great partners so they deserve the reassurance this isn't something they did and to hear they are.",
