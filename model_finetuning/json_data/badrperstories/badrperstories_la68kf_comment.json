            "body": "I can relate. I'm \"recovering\" from being dropped from a roleplay that seemed very promising and it's a plot I've been trying to have happen for about two or three years. Unfortunately, while the RP was interesting for them, it didn't quite vibe. Typically, I bounce back, no issue, but it was on top of a fairly bad week so it hit differently. Long story short, I said much of the same thing to a few other people: it's so mentally and emotionally exhausting.\n\nIf you go the group RP route, I'd suggest vetting people based on their post history, if possible. Are they someone who endlessly complains about everyone, no matter how petty, or are they someone who tries to offer advice/support? For example, I saw someone complain about some other person who'd evidently changed their pfp and name to reference a character, something that was incredibly common back in the AOL days where one screenname = one character.\n\nThe person in my example really isn't someone I'd be keen on writing with, just out of the wonder of \"gee. Am I going to be the next person on their list of complaints because I accidentally swapped my words around one too many times?\"\n\nI think some of the issue is it's common, now, to \"complain for the sake of complaining\". It nets attention, regardless of it's positive or negative. Either that or it's an inability to move on. I won't try to claim I'm innocent of complaining, but I don't sweat the small stuff.\n\nAnyhoo. I'm rambling. I definitely hope that you find someone to write with who you absolutely hit it off with.",

Less people will go out of their way to compliment than they will to complain, unless they have an incentive such as faux points, status or ego. Just because it's typical doesn't mean that people shouldn't strive to change.  However most who have worked in retail or service industry have seen this. Those \"How am I driving stickers?\" on the backs of business cars and trucks? How often do you think they get someone calling because they wanted to tell how the driver was going the speed limit and using turn signals? I'm guessing not much. \n\nAll that aside, it is frustrating when something happens with rp that makes it not work out. Rp writing is a bit like dating. There are thousand and one reasons why people don't go on future dates or break up. The reasons could be something you can change like chewing with your mouth open or talking about your ex. It could be something that you shouldn't have to change like your faith or whether you want kids. \n\nThe point is that it can be frustrating when you meet 50 people and don't even make it to the fourth date. That doesn't mean you stop dating. It means you change something. Maybe it's your ad and communicating things that were deal breakers in the past or posting in a new area. Perhaps it's changing behavior or improving yourself. Sometimes it is recognizing that humans can be fickle creatures and not every rejection is about you. \n\nStick with it. Practice making the tower stronger and then enjoy the time playing. You'll get there. \u2764",

This results in needing a combination of a knee brace, the cane, and multiple meds to help with both muscle and nerve pain.\n\nI don't mind changes during the course of the roleplay. It can make things interesting and I find it fun to see how the characters react to major changes. I tend to be chill and roll with things and I've thrown my characters under the bus countless times.\n\nThat's something I've always found funny in a sort of \"hmm\" way: the surprisingly bad reading comprehension.
