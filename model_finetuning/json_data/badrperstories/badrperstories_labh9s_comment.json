And what I mean is that half server wanted her character dead.\n\nApparently she has to be considered pure and a cute lady, and that shielded from... Everything. Even legal punishment. This girl poisons a king (apparently not being aware of it) and kills him, but since she's \"cute and innocent\" she gets teleported away by someone else and gets saved from my characters who wanted to 1 shank her and 2 interrogate her.\n\nJust because she's cute and a child so she has to be morally irreprensive regardless of what she does. That made my blood fuming \n\nOn a positive and different note I play a pacifist character, which could easily cover a support role but also be a damn one woman army due to the power she wields. And for that, she restrains herself following her moral code (let's say it's a bit of ooc nerf for her powers). \nBut if she needs to, she'll bitch slap anyone who attempt to cause harm to someone else.\n\nPeople have the tendency to think pacifism means \"uwu flowers hippie and stop war pwease\", but in reality it's just an overused trope. Pacifism means actually settle down violence without shredding blood. Most of the pacifists are actually active people, not passive. \n\nSitting in a corner of a fight crying won't help your friend or your foe from not getting gutted. \nIt is about taking a position and end the fight with less harm caused as possible. Will someone feel pain? Well\u2026 I am sorry, but at least no one got killed.\n\nThat's how my pacifist character thinks and acts. She will try to settle scores and stop people from bashing each others head.",

            "body": "I guess it depends on what you mean by pure/innocent characters vs naive characters. A lot of what you're describing sounds like just bad character design and execution and not really anything specific to a pure/innocent character.  \n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable to play a rookie or newbie, for example a new adventurer with little practical experience. The problem then comes when you start layering on unrealistic character traits, like extreme pacifism. Reasonable would be someone who balks or refuses to kill sapient humanoids (i.e. humans, elves, etc) but having qualms over killing a hostile animal/monster begs the question of - why did you even leave your home?? \n\n&gt;Their character might not even know they\u2019re in danger if a monster comes rushing at them.\n\n&gt;they're airheads\n\n&gt;knowledge comparable to a 5th grader\n\nThis sort of thing isn't acceptable by any standards, no matter what character type you're going for. \n\n&gt;they would be the last person you go to for strategies.\n\nThere are ways to be naive/innocent and not be completely useless or idiotic. I would say innocent =/= stupid, but if people are playing as such that's a problem. Similarly, if people are just playing stupid and hindering others, that's a problem regardless of whether or not their intent is to be innocent/pure/naive or whatever. A lot of complaints in D&amp;D come back to people playing low int and/or wis characters badly - you are NOT obligated to play them as making dumb choices all the time, or always going for a sub-optimal approach, and in fact doing so is frowned upon and considered bad etiquette as it hinders the party.\n\n&gt;It makes for great scenarios...but not in every single fight.\n\nIf it's happening every single fight, then the character isn't learning/developing. They're being willfully stubborn and obnoxious. \n\n&gt;They\u2019ll likely have support roles or they\u2019ll be defenseless so you\u2019ll need to protect them.\n\nTBH nothing wrong with this on it's own. Support roles can come in clutch, if they're playing well to their strengths, and can be a bit squishy.",

I am fine with writing some of my characters taking care of someone innocent or literal children, I even search for it myself sometimes.\n\nStill, there are plenty of my characters whose storyline I want to explore without them having someone to permanently take care of. \n\nBut some people with innocent/pure characters are like 'Your character has to do this now, forever, or my character will literally die! He would be the worst person in the world if he did not do this'. And so, my character HAS to do this (if I want to continue the roleplay, at least), because my characters are often a bit rude, but I rarely write characters who would let someone else just die, especially if it is a child/childlike character who really can't take care of themself.\n\nPlease, if you write this character type, do not do this. Ask people before you just force your character on them, ESPECIALLY if you want the other character to act as a caretaker for them over a longer period of time.

            "body": "That is the point. Be a pacifist should mean acting like Batman (to make a dumb example). Have a code of rules to follow and never break. \nCrying won't help when someone wants to kill your friends, and non acting is to consider as bad as harming the other person. If you instead manage to capture subdue the enemy and grant them mercy, congrats, because you just shown superiority while being handicapped by the fight (killing is usually easier than subduing) and your character is a fucking role model.\n\nIf you go around mass murdering enemies, whoever they are from minions to npcs to characters, you aren't any better than the people you are fighting against. You only get to subvert the system in your favour but someone else will have to pay for it anyway. \nThe message that transpires is that if you get bullied, you need to bully the bully. If you are hurt, you need to hurt someone back to make it even. And that's not how a supposedly good character should act. \n\nMost pieces of media fail to see this and if they do they attempt to make the villains even more dislikeable and despicable because of the hero's moral fails at being... Good, or make the hero disrupt the cycle of vengeance too late and spare just the villain. Welp, 400 minions you killed attacking the base are saying bruh in hell.",

            "body": "You can make a pure an innocent character who can still take care of themselves and are independent. They just might need the help of someone to gain confidence and come out if their shell, but that should be the most they need. They should be able to grow enough with that help that they will not fall to pieces when that help leaves because they should have already been able to take care of themselves before the help showed up.\n\nOr maybe they physical weaknesses they have are balanced by the help's advantages and vice versa. \n\nGrowth and balance are probably the most important parts of \"pure\" characters. Being completely dependant on others should be avoided unless they will grow out of it or we are talking battle-wise, like a close combat fighter needing a healer/long-range partner and vice versa. \n\nOr the acting pure is part of a trick. The innocent telling everyone not to fight and to trust everyone could be a villain trying to get people to lower their guards.\n\n\nIt all depends on the kind of story you want to tell, genre, and stuff like that.
