They were still really new, and the owner was taking advice from someone whose expertise lay in more DnD style servers. But I saw it had a lot of potential, so I decided to stay a while. This one lady joined shortly after, and she was really cool, but then she started inviting in her whole group which was something like 60 players. They were pulsed in over time, but they were still the majority and in a new group with only 4 members, they took over very quickly. And most of them were... how do I say this... Cunts. They were absolute cunts, yup.   \n\n\nThey wouldn't let anyone else speak in ooc chat. They would belittle other people's play styles or scenes. They would interrupt other people's conversations and then spam until the conversations were lost. Maybe two of them were moderately decent human beings, but those two were constantly getting steamrolled by their friends.   \n\n\nI tried bringing in a few people I knew to try and offset how skewed it was, but they just blocked my friends and their characters at ever turn, and took control of the game from the owner who eventually stepped down so they could run it.   \n\n\nI've had people try to pull the takeover in my own server, where they bring in 5-6 players all at once, give us a burst in activity, and then basically try to hold my server hostage to get me to give their characters special treatment. When I refuse, they all start leaving as if that's going to topple us, and it never does. It's unpleasant, sure, but we always stabilize within a week.   \n\n\nIt's great that some people have these massive groups they can swarm servers with. I wish I had that many friends with that much time on their hands. But I'm not about that clique play life. It's always toxic. It always becomes toxic.",

I was in one rp guild for 3 years and someone brought in a friend who proceeded to ship all her characters with every officer.  Then she invited all her rp friends and her rl friends in.  Then the whole new group left everyone else to make a new guild on another server.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy last rp guild was run by a married couple who 100% fit the passive and aggressive one.  I finally left because of the same drama repeating itself again and again.  The aggressive one would get mad and kick people over dumb stuff or they'd leave on their own.  Then the passive one would talk to the person and convince them to come back.  I wasn't even involved in any of the drama personally, but left because it's annoying when your guild is constantly mad at each other.  I didn't get anything as bad as being called a pedophile, thankfully, but I had to reroll characters because the aggressive one was a big part of the rp community and could not handle the rejection.",

I don't understand why some people are so entitled...\n\nOne time, I was part of such a group, but unknowingly. I was in a forum roleplay group, I was kind of new and never had many group roleplays before, and the people seemed so nice (to me). Then, maybe a week later, they asked me to join a different roleplay together, I was interested. We were maybe about ten people.\n\n But while doing so I noticed that some of them could be really fucking unpleasant, flat out rude, mocked a roleplay that they WANTED to join (why join something when you find the whole concept stupid and want them to change everything?), and acted like they were the Gods of roleplay and everyone had to bow to their will. I was not amused at all, and really taken aback by this behavior, but too shy to say anything at that time. I think I quit both roleplays soon after..",

The reason why I brought them in is because I was having a hard time finding others to rp with. Ping, message, or whatever I did no one noticed my requests.\n\nThe takeover section is most likely a coup raid in disguise. Mods kick a person in the rp didn\u2019t go how they wanted so they probably get on their alts and invite their friends to ruin the roleplay. Might not be all the time but it\u2019s done in spite. Which is why you need to be wary when a group of friends join, it\u2019s a clique and coup ready to happen.",
