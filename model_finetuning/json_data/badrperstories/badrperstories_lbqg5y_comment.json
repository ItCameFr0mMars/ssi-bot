            "body": "I totally feel for you.\n\nMy one thing though is dealing with pre-established relationships. I have a really good partner, and we vibe, and our characters vibe. But we have several AUs with these characters, even the same pairings, and sometimes their relationships are just slightly off the dynamic of another, same pair. For this reason alone, I\u2019m hesitant to simply plot out a past even with a player and a character I know intimately.\n\nI personally would at least do a short one-shot with those two characters forming the initial bond, to which you can base your RP on. That way their relationship is more organic, and feels more real than simply starting with it all pre-planned. \n\nThat way you can even vet if these characters have chemistry to begin with, instead of trying to force to people who don\u2019t like each other into being best friends.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the only thing I have a strong opinion on. Either way, good luck with your searches.",
