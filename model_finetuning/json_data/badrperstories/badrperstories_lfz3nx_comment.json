You can't get more unique than that, and if you can't you can write a description; use a faceclaim to help describe the character without relying solely on the photo if you can. Mix n match features from several!\n\nI guess it helps in my group we play a non-human race so having a drawn reference is kind of necessary but we have quite a few options to get one if you can't make it yourself. We're very accommodating for people, and I don't know why it's hard for others to just let people do what they need and if they struggle with a lacking description or trying to describe them the right way, offer to help.

Mix n match features from several!\n\nI have that conundrum where I can rarely decide on just one \"face\" for a faceclaim, so I'll use several. There are even apps and websites where you can morph those faces together! Sometimes with pretty comedic results. ;) But [MorphThing.com](https://MorphThing.com) seems pretty decent. At least then it's not just one famous face. I'm not sure how good it would be at mixing human and non-human features though. Proceed with caution! Ya never know what you'll end up with. ;)",

            "body": "In a rp community I moderated on a different website, people used faceclaims all the time, and nobody really minded. Someone (person A) posted their character's profile with a faceclaim, and a few days later, someone else (person B) posted an entirely separate character, but with the same faceclaim. \n\nPerson A saw it and flipped out on person B. I intervened, searched \"hot guy with abs\" on google, and found the exact faceclaim that both of them used, and brought it to their attention. I'd hoped that person A would see that person B had no intention of copying them. \n\nPerson B thought it was funny and they were willing to move on, but person A got banned because they called me the n-word. \n\nI then spent about 10 minutes trying to dissuade the owner from just banning faceclaims altogether. \n\nEdit: I'm a bit iffy with faceclaims because of this incident. However, I don't support or oppose them, and it honestly just depends on the person using the faceclaim. Some might say \"this is my character,\" and others will say \"my character looks similar to this person.\" In this case, person A was the \"this is MY character\" kind of guy.",
