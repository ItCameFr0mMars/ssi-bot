The more people in a group, the higher chances of there being drama. The more people in a thread, the higher chances of it dying. It's always harder to keep things running smoothly when you have dozens or hundreds of moving parts. \n\nThat being said, I think a lot of it comes down to the platform. I haven't had any luck with tumblr or Discord group roleplays, and very little luck with sandbox forums. My good experiences have all been with forum roleplays that are dedicated to a 'theme', for lack of a better word - a site with coherent setting and lore and an established core membergroup. I've seen sites last over a decade.",

            "body": "I always try group roleplays, again and again, but you are right, most fail in one way or the other. I think that the main intrigue of them is that you have the possibility of interacting with so many different characters. Even if I and my roleplay partner write multiple characters in a 1x1 roleplay, there is still more variety in a (good) group roleplay, because most writer's do prefer to write certain character types or narratives, and group roleplays attract many different\n\npeople.\n\nUnfortunately, the problems are also often more complicated. For example, many people in group roleplays aren't there because of the story and the lore of the roleplay, but treat them like a dating website for their OCs. \n\nSo, if you are unlucky, people don't really interact with other characters, only with their 'special' love interest, and the story doesn't progress, because 90% of the characters are busy making out with each other and don't care for the story. But if you would have a group roleplay where no romance is allowed...it would be rather unrealistic and maybe only two people would apply.\n\nAnd planning a good group roleplay is always very complicated, you don't want to limit the other writer's possibilities too much, but if you give them too much freedom with creating their characters, the lore of the roleplay will soon make no sense anymore. \n\nA lot of people also don't understand that good writing is very subjective. So you have some troublemakers who basically want to have the same 'power' over the narrative and what other writer's can write, and don't understand that they can't treat a group roleplay like their personal search. And this causes a lot of drama in the ooc chat. \n\nIn general, I believe that most group roleplays are unfortunately not worth the effort.",

            "body": "I got my roleplaying start on MUSHes back in the day, which were an offshoot of MUDs (more D&amp;D/adventure-oriented), and they'd often be based on some popular theme or game or series of books, such as *Vampire: the Masquerade,* Anne McCaffrey's *Pern* series, or The *Chronicles of Amber*  by Zelazny, to name a few. (My very first one was Elfquest-themed!) \n\nAnyway, having a cohesive theme helped, but I'm not sure how well directed some of the more popular ones were. It was more just a means to find folks to roleplay *with*, and everyone kinda had their own little sagas and story-arcs going. Some of the game admins would attempt to drive some over-arching plots, and that was what ultimately inspired me to create my own original-themed world and run it for about four years. \n\nIt was a lot of fun, but also a *serious* juggling act, because of some the reasons you cited. There were players plugged into certain roles like kings/emperors, but then they'd disappear and then it was a matter of either replacing the player or killing off said character. I tried to get ambitious and have an underlying secret group of immortal Illuminati-type characters controlling everything behind the scenes, but I'm not sure how much that impacted things as a whole. Honestly, when it comes down to it, most folks on those games were just playing out their own relationship dramas and hooking up. Probably same as nowadays. ;)\n\nI had way more time on my hands then and really enjoyed putting together all the lore for the game. And even more, allowing other players to add their own input. That was the best part, seeing players take some minor faction or group, flesh it out and add all this detail, and make it better than I ever could have on my own. To me, that's the true beauty of a \"shared world\" -- actually *sharing* it with others and letting them shape and mold it and make it greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nNowadays, I stick to one-on-one roleplays because they're easier to manage, and you still get some of those same perks of a shared world -- only that it's just with one other person. Way easier to direct the plots, though! But I do sometimes miss the energy and enthusiasm of group settings, and the fact that there they were a bit more self-sustaining. If one person dropped out, there were still plenty of others. In a one-on-one, if you lose your partner, there goes that world you created together.",
