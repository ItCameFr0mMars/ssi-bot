Right next to the meth boost that is intense action and drama.\n\nOr at least if you do rapid fire romance, let it be known first that you want it. Hell, I HAD a rapid fire romance where my character got picked up and walked off with caveman style with the declaration he was going to be her mate--mind you, I know the other party and the character is a very sweet guy I adore to hell and back, but without context it's really fucking weird because she'd said no several times before but it was the \"no because I'm stubborn, not an actual no-no\" because of her character and now we're rolling with the awkwardness of whirlwind romance and it's great.\n\nHe gets to re-experience love, and she gets taken out of her comfort zone and can address her issues with someone that will literally kill and probably bury in a shallow grave anyone that dares endanger her (it's a fun concept, I love savage/civil dichotomies), and they get to struggle together with the fact they don't actually know each other or how broken they are.\n\nAlso she might be pregnant simply due a writing detail that got skipped over and that was a total accident...\n\nFast paced can work if you're willing to work with the inevitable consequences, but you have to trust the other person to handle it well too and that seems to be a lot to ask of people these days...",

We HAVE mind reading as a very rare ability in our group, but we only give it to competent gamers that don't power play and it's widely known in meta that this character CAN do that so no one is caught unaware, but he has to hide he can because lore reasons\n\nAs for this it doesn't seem like they have magic to justify their metagaming and that's just giving credit to the idea they probably aren't as good if a roleplayer as they seem",

Just a little. \nI think is mostly about this that ticks off the slow burn: the fact IC time flows usually slower than IRL and drives us nuts.\n\nBut I always think about the opposite, which is people that jump on each other after just meeting and dating one hour long before turn in the average stale rp couple (ugh the cringe. Please give me the possibility of smash a non romantic plot point over these couples)\nThat reassures me and tells me that friendzone the person that just expressed the feelings for my character the day they met is the right plot choice and makes the romance more interesting. Either fasten the pace of day or night, either smash a non-romantic event  in the rp to take a pause from the constant romance, hold the big reveal, as it will twice the greatness when it pops in action.\n\nI feel like you, and I daily scream inside, but I try to fight and hold.",
