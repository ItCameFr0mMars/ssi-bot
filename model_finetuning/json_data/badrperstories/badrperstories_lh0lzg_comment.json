It has so many moving parts and requires a lot of hands on work, that I think many don't understand.\n\nYour points are common among group RPers I hear. I used to GM on forums for group RPs and it was so tough. I kept it modest in size and always got everything in order prior to beginning. Gotta make tough calls when you feel like a bad guy rejecting terrible OCs. \n\nI think with the addition of places like discord, you'd think GMs would be in even better/greater control of their RPs but it's a shame that's not the case for many. I'd say keep looking for a good group, it's almost tougher than finding a good one-on-one partner because groups can change so much due to people dropping/getting complacent/bad leadership and stuff.",

You can write a character in more than one space, just keep track of your own timelines\" rule has been such an ease-of-play thing I'm surprised it isn't more common across RP servers.  \n\n\nAs for having all of the rules posted ahead of time, I can sympathize with fresher GM's. A person can try to cover all the bases as best as they can in advance, but strangers online have a fantastic way of bringing you the strangest things you never would have thought of, much less thought you'd need to write a rule for.",
