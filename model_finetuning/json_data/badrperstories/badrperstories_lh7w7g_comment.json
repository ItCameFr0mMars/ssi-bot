That sounds more like... idk, basic worldbuilding? Unless you absolutely refused to work any other way, you're fine, in my opinion.

This last issue was just the straw that broke the camels back because i was fully done working it out with her.\n\nShe also wanted to kill all my characters off (I had a lot of male supporting characters but they weren't introduced to her char yet.) all the time and rp'd gruesomely beating up some of my characters and threw a fit when I told her that's not cool.\n\nThe characters were in a whole other kingdom but she brought them there in her post just to beat them up and kill them off because in her words \"Girl power\" which was a huge wtf to me.\n\nShe also had a huge issue where her character had to be more powerful than every man and woman in the rp. She also was big on giving her characters serious trauma which were triggers to my own trauma.\n\nWe also had plans for a war in the kingdom like a civil war later on in the rp we hadn't got to. One day she just said \"Well I'll have my character run away and disappear its totally what she'd do in a war, (Insert love interests name) and the prince will come after her to find her lol XDDD\" Her character was going to be the leader of the rebellion something she wanted yet she wanted her character to run and hide and be chased down.\n\nAnother issue was with that, The love interest was the commander of the army, a commander would not / could not just abandon everything to run off after a girl. The prince is cold hearted and ruthless like he was not supposed to be a love interest. So that plan of hers really wouldn't work.\n\nThe other issue I had with her is im Asexual, she kept trying to push things like scenes in dramas where they breathe in incense that makes them...very sexual. She wanted her character to be able to grope all over my character. (I play all my chars as Asexual because I don't want anyone to even force my chars into things i'm uncomfortable with, I've tried for years to get people to respect my boundaries but they don't unless I make my chars sexuality specifically asexual) She went as far as implying her character could fix my chars asexuality, which was highly offensive to me as an ace so I sat down, and talked to her about how that's not okay, and talked to her about what asexuality was in case she was just confused.\n\nShe did understand it or seemed to anyways but then she just started pushing sexual things, more of her char objectifying my own chars.\n\nI'm fully aware I probably should have dropped her quite a long while back but I genuinely thought I could work it out with her, plus she was my friend and I didn't want to hurt or offend her.",

You were kind enough to give her a heads up that you would be unavailable for and told her the extent of time.   \n\n\nIt sounds like she's just toxic and wants it to be all about her character. Even the most perfect people would lie to keep themselves from unnecessary prejudice. The excuse of a character being morally superior that they never lie isn't grounds to protect that character for the sake of the story. I seek for a roleplay partner because I want collaboration of minds. If I just wanted to obsess over a character Id write a fanfic.",
