I mentioned RP would wind down a bit because I had to pick up full time work as opposed to part time. Finances for the month were tight. He then immediately starts calling into question me and my partner\u2019s financial sensibilities because he\u2019s being deprived of RP- one where IM hedging all of the effort. Kid what the fuck? You\u2019ve never even lived on your own.\n\nPeople like this deserve to be left hanging IMO, life comes first and it\u2019s best to treat immaturity with harshness.
