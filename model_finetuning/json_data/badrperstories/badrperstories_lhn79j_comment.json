If it's small this server is in danger and if you care about making it better discuss the mods about advertisement and collage to help grow the server and bring new people in hopes they will help get the story moving.\n\nI would also try and gather a group of the more active rpers and get together in a mini group to discuss a plotline you all can do. If you are unfortunately in a situation where one of your characters are already in an rp with someone who does the above of what you said, create a new character if the server allows more than one character and try to find another rper.\n\nIf people are from different places in the world, ask about their country so you can look up their timezones. It's also possible people\u2019s times can clash and it's difficult to find a time to rp. For example, my rp partner was from UK. I'm from the U.S. And we were about 4-5 hours apart. I have more free time around 11 a.m. As that's when the majority of my classes are done so I take the time to reply to the rp.\n\nI feel you in this situation cause I went through this three times. Ironically this happens mostly in servers with teens as most (not all) have really bad time management and no set schedule which makes them stress out and use the servers to vent or chat to lessen their stress. Same song and dance \u1555( \u141b )\u1557. Stay in the server for a few days, weeks or even a month to see how it goes. If it isn't during that time I would suggest jumping ship before you waste your time.",

I really think it\u2019s irrelevant what people are doing in the ooc - I tend to have all those channels muted. But sometimes you get players who are %90 ooc and just need the urge, whose rp is value. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to peek in on a friendly ooc vibe.

They rejoined a few weeks later like \"where did this server go?\" and then proceeded to do the same thing they had before\u2014nothing!

I'll post before bed.\" Next day... Hey Bob and Sam, when are you posting? \"Oh, I've got school in an hour, I'll post later,\" \"I'll post after Bob,\" etc. and then after Bob posted, Sam would 'forget' and have to be poked again. Meanwhile, Bob and Sam were posting 2-3x daily in some side RP where they were having a drinking contest or something inane. \n\nPeople who were actually interested in the plots got upset about waiting 3-5 days for 1-2 people in their event chan to post.
