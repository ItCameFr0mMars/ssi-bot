If you're the only one putting the effort in it's not that much different then just writing fic on your own.  And if we wanted to write fic that's... what we would do lol.\n\nNext time you rp together maybe just tell them you're feeling a little burnt out and point plant ask them to do some plot planning.  If they still don't want to participate? Maybe time to move on.",

And they basically said they didn't need to watch it first because they'll just follow along with what I write. That they preferred to learn the plot through me instead of watching the material.\n\nSo they came to me with an idea based on something they knew nothing about and expected me to hold their hand and fill in all the details throughout the entire roleplay.",
