If the former, then maybe there is some issue with you not quite getting across what you mean. If not, then I'd say you're in the clear. Either way though,  this person is being an ass, so I'd give serious consideration to whether the good is really worth the grief. \n\nHave you tried talking to her honestly about this? If not, it's a good first step. If she is really the narcissist she sounds, it's unlikely to help but at least you'll know you tried and can move on.

From what it seems, she's hellbent on demeaning your characters, even if they try to reason with her characters in the rp. \n\nIdk what it's actually called when literally every character shares the exact same viewpoints, but I just call it \"same face syndrome.\" She has no conflict between her own characters, therefore, by her logic, there is no development happening. If she is that focused on \"development\" with your characters, then I've got a sneaking suspicion that she's just trying to find an excuse for having her characters act like they did. \n\nI'd say maybe try speak with her about having her characters help resolve conflicts without it devolving into mudslinging and overall having characters be bad people. If she won't have any of it, then I suggest just leaving.",
