I do rp smut, but it's with my husband's blessing and complete transparency. It -never- crosses over to rl beyond friendship.\n\nMy typical age limit is 21. I chose that age because I deal with drugs and alcohol. While nothing stops those under 21 drinking, I prefer to not encourage or romanticize it in those younger. Plus it's nice when someone understands that 1 beer typically isn't going to cause you to blackout. Heh. \n\nI have had ads for 25+ because of maturity concerns like flakiness, trying to cross into rl smut, etc but honestly poor partners come across the age spectrum. I do belong to a 25+ rp search hub on discord. If you'd like the link, shoot me a pm.\n\nFar as where I find partners, reddit and rp search communities. I don't include my age in ads, simply state my are limits. If they ask, I'm fine with sharing it. \n\nHope that helps. It's a patience game like finding rp partners no matter the age!",

I also prefer to RP older characters, which automatically disqualifies a lot of younger RPers. But - there's no reason that somebody younger than 25 couldn't hit all of those metrics. Probably RPing romance with a teen would feel a little weird (also, as somebody who used to be a teenager who RPd smut - it would likely be unintentionally hilarious), but aside from that, yeah.\n\nI'm still in touch with some people that I RPd with 10 years ago, but aside from that, it's hard. ime a lot of people don't RP anymore, and the number gets smaller every year.

But I feel like us older folk (late 20s to late 30s) are struggling. I think it's great RPing is gaining traction. Back in the day (think 15-20 years ago) it was so tough to find partners in general. It felt so niche to me. But I do like writing with people wihin 5-7 years of my own age just due to the fact we're closer in life-stages. In HS and even middle school, I could post often. Come college and the real world (juggling a job and family (be it SO or parents getting older etc) ensures both parties are okay with a slower pace, who might be less prone to drama. Expectations are easier met. I would say the landscape of finding partners has changed.\n\nI used to roam tumblr and other forums but that seems to be drying up and the newer generation seems to be taking over with chat based platforms. I wish I had advice for you OP, but I do think reddit is a decent place. Some of the RP-based subs are a bit strict with rules but if you don't want smut content, I do think you'll still find those partners. Now that I'm older, I do try to double check with new partners who are my age, to ensure we know each other's limits regarding that kind of content. I think the only thing to do is to stress communication and keep at it.\n\nBeing 30, I would like to write with people who are in their mid 20s but I can't fact check someone's age but ideally someone who is an adult (not a young adult mind you) is who I look for, someone who can communicate ideas and respect mine. I think as we get older, it will get harder to find those who keep up with the hobby so I assume some compromises will be needed. It's a double-edged sword, as someone who remembers the RPing rooms on YIM/AIM and those hidden places on even Myspace, Neopets and Gaiaonline.",

            "body": "I'm in my 40s, and I often feel like a dinosaur in the roleplay community. I got into it in college and have done it off and on for the last couple decades. It's such a fun way to flex my creative muscles and keep my writing momentum going, as that's something I struggle with on solo projects. Roleplay sort of \"broke me\" when it comes to sustaining my interest without a partner to brainstorm with and bounce ideas off of, so that's just something I've had to come to accept about myself. But it's so much fun when you find a partner who shares your sensibilities and can create a saga that really comes to life!\n\nOf course, *finding* such partners can be difficult, and the level of maturity and writing ability is definitely a factor. I've tended to have better luck on [Barbermonger.](http://barbermonger.me/) It's a smaller pool but the  ads seem a bit more thoughtful and detailed -- sometimes I get the feeling on Reddit that folks are just throwing  a rock and seeing what it hits. At my age, I've gotten much pickier!\n\nOh, and I'm also married, but still play out NSFW themes. Most of my longer-term partners have been other women like myself, and we share similar sensibilities on romantic/erotic themes, so it's been fun to explore that -- basically co-writing romance novels together! Since I'm a big reader of them, that's been a fun way to delve into my love of such tropes and storylines. Plus it removes any awkwardness with IC feelings bleeding into OOC ones. In general, that's not something I've really encountered much with older roleplayers. It's like we \"get\" that it's just a fun fiction we're weaving.\n\nBut we're a rarer breed, so I mostly just wanted to comment on this post and encourage more older roleplayers to come out of the woodwork! I'm also on the 25+ Discord hub, but I wish there were a group even more geared toward players aged, say 30 and up. It would be smaller, yes, but I'd at least feel comfier among my \"peeps.\" If I had more time/inclination, I'd try and start something up myself, but that's way more responsibility than I want to assume. Mostly I just want to tell fun stories with other creative, middle-aged, aspiring writers like myself, and maybe have a place to talk about the challenges, frustrations, and exciting dynamics and discoveries about this hobby we all love.",
