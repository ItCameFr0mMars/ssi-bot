World-building is an excellent hobby for roleplayers too.  Journaling is creative and can be helpful in recovery too.  Maybe take up another creative hobby like crafting or drawing.\n\nWhen you get to the point where you're able to deal with roleplay again, make all new accounts with a new username then interact with DIFFERENT people.
