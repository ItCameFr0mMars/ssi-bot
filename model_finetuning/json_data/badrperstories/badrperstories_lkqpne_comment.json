I RP a lot of canon stuff and some people I've roleplayed with apparently take this as it being okay to start sending me lewd art of every possible character and pairing in the fandom that **they** are into.\n\nLike, I am okay with it if it is the pairing we RP, our RP has NSFW in it, and it actually matches their characterizarions and how they are together in the RP. It feels fitting. Not weirdly out of place. They're like illustrations to the story we write in a way.\n\nI can overlook when a partner kinda assumed that's okay to do, when it is that way. Even if I think it's definitely proper conduct to actually ask if it's okay to send a partner lewd art first. \n\nBut... I really didn't need to see art of a male character I don't even like and isn't even in the RP,  being feminized and wearing frilly underwear, thanks. Not my thing. \n\nIt's like whenever I do an MxM RP some people seem to assume I just like any gay type of fetish being applied to any male character somehow. I don't. And, it is always girls that do it. Never male partners. I know they say sharing is caring. But oversharing is overbearing! LOL\n\nAlso that 'hey loser' thing is so random and weird.
