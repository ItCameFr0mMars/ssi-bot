There are a bunch of reasons they could have gone offline. If they wanted to not purposefully not rp with you they likely would not said they were going to have more time, but would have made an excuse why they couldn't. And right now, Texas is a perfect excuse.",

            "body": "As someone who does ghost people and has social anxiety, all I can say is, not everything is related to you, and this is said with kindness and not sass. It's a SIMPLE concept for people to give others a notice about their possible unavailability, but it's not an EASY feat. For people like me (and that person in your post), the best way to curb the surfacing of such a mechanism is really just, from the very beginning, \"I don't mind if you want to quit, just let me know so I can start finding new people, no hard feelings.\"\n\nRegarding your preference for active roleplayers, I think it's just something to learn to take in stride, unfortunately. I've had my share of people who take very long to reply even before I became a worn-out roleplayer myself. It's a dual-bladed sword, really, because these very people who are so busy have more robust characters, since they're out there having enriched lives. (But if their roleplaying is sub-par, just abandon the ship, matey. Price and value don't match in such cases, not worth.)\n\nBest bet right now is to make a Note (literally) on their profile so that you never write with them again if they ever approach you in a forgotten future. Or, block them, if your day gets soured by their new ads.\n\nAs for why they didn't tell you if they wanted to roleplay still or not, in my experience, I avoid confrontation with people that give me the impression that they are sensitive and take things personally. Not sure about your Bad; if it bugs you that much, I'd say to point-blank ask them.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you about some things. Let me know when you're free. I'd prefer if I hear your side of the story in the case that you're slapped with an unfair impression.\"\n\nUsually, that serious tone gets anyone to respond me if they aren't already a lost cause.",
