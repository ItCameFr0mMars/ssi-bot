            "body": "I feel like I'm straddling this line.   \n\n\nOn one hand, it feels REALLY invasive when I'm in a scene with one other person, and then the peanut gallery in the OOC chat starts talking about our scene and running a commentary, or telling me how they love reading my character's journal. I know they're doing it to be supportive, but it just feels so weird to me when people are reading my scenes that they're not in and commenting on it.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, I know from an owner's perspective that servers with a ton of lore need new players watched to make sure they're not putting something into canon that is physically impossible or otherwise goes completely against the lore. As an owner, I'll usually just skim for buzz words while generally trying to give as much privacy as I can, because I know how iffy it makes me feel when it's done to me.   \n\n\nIdk I can see both sides, depending on who it is that's doing it, but I also know that the first time it was done to me was really jarring. Given that you're talking about the leader of the server, I have to say I don't agree to calling them a dick. Unless their server has no lore at all, they need to double check your posts to make sure you're not messing up, at least until you have it all down enough that you can fly solo. Corrections aren't issued to call you out for not knowing everything, they're done because something was written that's canonically incorrect and just needs a little sprucing. If that's not for you, okay, don't join that server, but that doesn't make them petty, immature, or a dick just for doing their job.",
