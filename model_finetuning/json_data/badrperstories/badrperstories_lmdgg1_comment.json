They wanted active, as in, a few posts a day. It's fine if we write short lines, except they also wanted a few paragraphs at a time. Instantly, I'm left to wonder if they have no day to seize, no life to tend to, all day everyday. Suddenly, they came off as a plain and boring person to me. And suddenly, I didn't want to write with them anyway and thanked the stars that we haven't started anything.",

You come across as if you're suggesting they don't have a life or are boring. For me personally, on average I need daily responses (yes multi-paragraph) and I want some days it's more than one. I don't mind days off and I take them too, but I want an active partner who is as interested and excited about the world we create as I am. \n\nMany of us have quite allot of stuff going on or that consumes our day. I'm a relatively fast writer and I'm lucky because I can make little pockets in my day to do so. It is like any other hobby or thing you enjoy. I think it is important that people take time to relax and make things they enjoy a part of their lives even if its video games, writing, art, cars, etc. It is okay for you to deem creative writing or rp as not high on that list, but for others it is and there isn't anything wrong with that.",
