God, I had some similar issues with Sawdust and his GF for a while.\n\nHis GF had a character we all liked but he was listed as \"neutral evil\" and for no reason other than he was a bounty hunter that we could glean. It sort of became a meme that he \"wasn't really evil, guys, he's so good with kids\" but she would still sometimes insist he WAS NE but proceed to write him more Chaotic Neutral or thereabouts. Like, there was nothing overtly \"evil\" about him, he didn't enjoy murdering people for the sake of murder, etc etc. That's not so bad tho and no harm came of it\n\nBut Sawdust, ohhhhhhh boy. He wrote murderhobo edgelords til the day turned dusk and proceeded to act out on every occasion, brazenly murdering NPCs for every minor slight against him, and generally being a menace, and then BITCH when we said anything about how he's evil, there will be consequences, hey man maybe don't murder civilians in city limits please, and generally a terrible person--and Sawdust would defend him that he's \"not evil\" and \"we didn't understand\" and trying to justify his actions and cannibalism and theft if property and so much else and some of it actually made his character sound like a serial killer rather than a misunderstood anti-hero.\n\nLike dude, do not write a cannibalistic murderhobo with an edgy++ backstory that violates all the laws and moral codes of the world and then try to tell us he's not evil just because we suddenly don't like him or don't want to bang your reanimated corpse wannabe. Commit to the bit and be a criminal that we can't easily kill off because he's a player character or fucking get your head out of your ass and stop writing him BEING EVIL so we have a reason to believe you.\n\nEvil characters can be redeemed, it's happened twice so far in the same RP group because of \"oops, character development\" so it's not impossible, but he's the kind that's allergic to change. Either you like his character whole cloth and he never changes at all or you don't and you're the asshole because he's stuck in a loop of being annoying and poorly written.\n\nBut yeah\n\nIf you're evil, commit to being evil or stop wasting everyone's time, essentially \ud83d\ude2c",

Sometimes these rpers have trouble separating IC and OOC and sometimes it's just not recognizing their preference. The later just keep just trying to fit a square peg into a round hole rather than play the characters they enjoy. \n\nI have players who like this answer my ad when I'm looking for immoral, \"evil\" characters. I'll confirm in the interview that they understand that a kind, gentle man is not going to work with my character. Then the rp starts and they are essentially playing Mr. Rogers. \n\nOn a rare occasion I'll get someone who treats \"evil\" like hack and slash psychopath. Don't get me wrong, killing npcs in rp is great, but many have no depth, no motivations, no finesse.  It's like two dimensional evil and it's boring as hell to me. \n\nI'm sorry you went through this. It sounds like it was really frustrating.",

I roleplay a lot of villains and it's always bizarre seeing other villain writers getting upset when their partners' characters react appropriately to their villainous actions.

Ooc sure, you can gush over even the most evil character if you want, but that's not realistic for the characters actually experiencing that evil ic.\n\nI weirdly have the opposite happen, too. The hero character hates my villain, understandably, and does all they can to defeat him, as a hero does. But then they expect my villain to like them and never make them face consequences? I had this one character break into my villain's domain and kill a bunch of his henchmen, but got stabbed in the process. Their reaction was to then crawl their way to my villain and beg for help because one of his guys hurt them and they \"were too young to die.\" Like... what? You got yourself stabbed because *you broke into his headquarters and killed his men*, and you want him to give you medical aid?\n\nAt the end of the day, people gotta be able to handle realistic reactions to their character's actions.",

They shoot their own selves in the foot. They don't have many, if any, friends.
