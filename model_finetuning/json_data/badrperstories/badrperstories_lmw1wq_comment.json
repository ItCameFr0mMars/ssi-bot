I was pretty sure it was an unwritten rule that you don't ask about rl unless it pertained to someone's availability to rp, timezones and such? Even then I'm uncomfortable letting someone know which part of the world they could find me. \n\nBut trying to cross the barrier? Really. This is roleplay. Fiction. If they wanted nudes or find a sexting partner, there's plenty of other places for that. \n\nI also get pretty peeved when I get ghosted or not get a response for days. But I also don't hold it against them. More often that not, something came up and they had to duck out of the rp and come back. Great! But sometimes they just lost interest and there's nothing you can really do about that. Like plenty of others said, it takes two to tango and one side isn't interested anymore it was bound to fall apart later anyways. The most I do is ask them, \"Are you still interested? Are you still having fun?\"\n\nGetting mad at about it and letting them know about your displeasure is not the way to go about it.\n\nSorry to hear what you've been dealing with in Texas. Stay safe over there. The best rp partners would understand situation and not be too miffed. I got busy at work for a solid week and didn't get to reply to my ongoing rps. Predictably, some of them dropped me. But the ones that were still with me are the ones I jive within the most anyways.",

Stay safe, OP!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to your rant: I'd retort to the dude. \"It must be a huge shock to you, but apparently powers go out sometimes because of bad weathers. Thank you for the time spent, but I think it's best we call off the roleplay now, because you make me feel uncomfortable.\" He sounds like the kind of dudes who pretend they want to roleplay, but are really baiting people into sending pics (and eventually nudes) to help them \"visualise\". (snort) And that manipulative way of speaking sends me. \"It's not right of you to do that without a reason.\" It's like those dudes who sound charismatic while putting down a girl's sense of self, exploiting on those who are anxious or eager to please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, that last burn is ouch.",
