            "body": "I agree it is not done to rant about something like this in a whole community that likely isn't designed for it (like this sub) and directly calling someone out, likely even blowing it out of proportion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI agree with the *Bad* that, if it **did** happen; it isn't cool to call someone's OC ugly and that is why you wouldn't want to write with them. Still no excuse to publicly call them out though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI agree with the *Bad* that, in the end, looks shouldn't matter, but a character's personality does. A well-rounded interesting character is what makes a good story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also understand, if, as they described what keeps happening to them, does keep happening to them, that they are upset. Again, still no excuse to publicly call someone out, but I do sympathize with them.\n\nHowever, I also agree that everyone should be entitled to decide whether or not they want to RP with a certain OC or not.  RPing is a hobby so no one should have to do something they do not want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, if someone rejects a character based on looks alone, I would wonder what it is they are actually wanting to do. Doesn't instill in me the confidence that they are just looking for a RP, doesn't seem to me like they'd want to just write a legit story with a good plot. Makes me feel they want something more out of it, and likely want to do self-insert and self-indulgence RP. Either in lieu of dating and/or just to get their rocks off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am of the opinion that it is shallow and petty to reject a character based solely on looks. You used the example of how you rejected a drag-character. Wich is not the same in my opinion. A drag-character also encompasses a lifestyle, it will likely be a big aspect of the story you'd wind up writing with such a character. So, that goes beyond the exterior. As a result, your reason to reject the notion to RP with such a character didn't come off as shallow to me, it felt grounded and fair. It was about much more than just not liking how a character looks. But if a character, for example, has a hair color one does not like, that hardly defines the character in any shape or form nor does it have any bearing on the story. Unless there's some type of plot surrounding hair colors and whatnot. But you get the idea. So, to reject a character over something like that when it really is only a visual thing alone that has no effect on anything but a person's own \\*taste\\*, is in my opinion, indeed rather shallow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's also circumstantial though. I think it's fine if two people are indeed looking for something in which character looks matter. Given that they are open and honest beforehand about it. That there is transparency about looking to write smut with a character they find hot. In that case, I think it's fair to reject a character due to not liking their looks. It's not okay if that is not the ad or goal the person they contacted to RP with was looking for and they pretend they're indeed on the same page in what they want as the person they contacted. Secret agendas being pushed on people in the RP community is a big thing. Someone rejecting a character based on looks for what is supposed to be a regular RP with wholesome intentions is definitely a big red flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixing formatting issues.",

            "body": "Like I said, I don't think Bad's Bad said their OC is ugly. iirc, **their OC has a physical affliction, though I can't remember if it's lacking a limb or having vitiligo**. For me personally, I couldn't care less about the looks, but moreso the backstories and lifestyle, personality and other intrinsic attributes of an individual. But referencing back to Bad's rant, I think when one's OC is very different from the majority, rather than to approach someone and engage them in a face-off where they're stuck with bad choices of, or (1) \"Oh shit, do I just ghost them and pretend I didn't see their message?\" (2) \"Sorry, I don't like this. It's just not the look I'm used to.\" because of something they're unfamiliar with, it's best to just put your own ad out there so that people who see and approach you are already OK with it, sparing any of that awkward talk.\n\n*Again, why is everyone talking about smut when I mentioned nothing of the sort in my post. Is that what you think of as soon as people mention gay romance??*\n\n***Maybe*** they were planning to smut and Bad's Bad doesn't like to visualize it, I have no idea. Speaking of visualization, I think it's quite normal when people look for a specific look. It's like how people say when a couple \"look good together\", etc. There are bound to be people who are all about the looks, that's just how it is. ~~COUGH, shallow Netflix shows that are based on bad themes made \"okay\" just because the actors look handsome to the target audience.~~\n\nBut I appreciate your well-thought response.",

If it's something clearly of a fetish, then I would decline.\n\nI find it a frustrating thing when people say they're all about the honesty, and then get angry when someone doesn't like the appearance of their OC. It does make the reviewer shallow, but again, people are entitled to their opinion. I still don't see it valid to call someone out in a huge group like that.\n\nIf it sheds any light on the matter, Bad's OC has an affliction. I just can't recall if it's losing a limb or vitiligo. I feel like, if it's so personal to them, they shouldn't approach people who pose a risk of rejecting their character. It's just like RL. Rather, it's better they just post an ad so that those who respond to them are sincerely interested and not trying to be nice, yanno?",

I don't smut myself, so I'm not sure how people go about the discussions; like your [i]assumption[/i], my [i]assumption[/i] is that people only talk about kinks when it comes to smut roleplays, with the occasional fetishized body parts in exaggeration.\n\nIf it helps you think from Bad's Bad's perspective, their character has an affliction that definitely affects their character's life if you delve into the subtlety of everyday ongoings. I can't remember if it's losing a limb, or having vitiligo, but both does affect how people behave in subtle ways. Or maybe Bad's Bad is shallow and just doesn't like how people have spotty-coloured skin. Beats me.\n\nUnless your previous comments of \"you\" \"you\" you\" are all targeted at [i]me[/i], in which case, drag queens are not just a look, but a lifestyle and I can't trust a rando to portray it as not a fetish unless I trust the author to respectfully play it to not further make my already unpleasant list of experience with RL drag queens worse. (Surprise, bad experiences could be triggers too!)\n\nMaybe if I had written with them before and they proved to be competent, sure. But not off the bat. And if that's the only character types they have, then part ways it is. Like my post mentioned, there are hundreds of people in it. Surely they'll find someone else who is keen to explore their interests with them.",
