Plus the Jareds who don't read your ad \n\nat all.\n\nBut especially with terms like 'advanced', it is really hard to find someone who shares the same definition. Some people call my roleplays advanced because I don't do one-liners and usually write 2-5 paragraphs, but I am just okay when it comes to the 'this roleplay has beautiful, almost novel like descriptions' part. Also with stuff like 'creative'...some people tell me my roleplays are creative, but I have seen roleplays that were much more creative, so I think that this is super subjective and some people might honestly think that they fit your standards, but they don't.\n\nI always find it more helpful if people also included how many words they are approximately looking for in a reply, not only paragraphs, because as you said, only mentioning paragraphs might attract people who write very short paragraphs. \n\nThe thing with the paragraphs seems more like a communication issue to me. If someone tells me they expect 2-3 paragraphs minimum, I will honestly answer that yes, I can write four paragraphs or even five (and I will do so if the situation calls for it). But I would expect that 2-3 are totally fine for them, and not a compromise on their part. So I would probably be a bit confused what their issue is if I fulfill their expectations, but they still feel let down by me.",

            "body": "I don't know what to say here. I get feeling frustrated because you can't find partners to match you and therefore feed your muse, but the wording of this feels vaguely elitist.   \n\n\nAt first, I was confused by what an \"AD\" was, then I realized you meant \"ad\" as in *advertisement.*  \n\n\nFour paragraphs per post isn't advanced though, that's more on the lower side of the multi-para spectrum, which might be why you're getting less than what you're advertising for. Also by definition, a paragraph is 4 sentences, so I'm wondering why you're knocking that.   \n\n\nWhen I think of advanced writers, I'm picturing Novella writers who have no problem with banging out 20 paragraphs per post, all jam packed with actionable content and minimal fluff.  I know many writers who can do that, all of whom came from Reddit.   \n\n\nIf I could guess from looking through your *ads*, I would say that probably the most notable deterrent for other \"advanced\" writers is that your starter is in first person. Every novella writer I have met sticks to 3rd Person, maybe occasionally dipping into 2nd, because 1st Person writing implies your character is the main character and nobody wants to play a side character. We all have characters with valid stories, but when one person is writing in 1st Person, it sets the vibe that the story is entirely about them and their character, their progression. It's a little selfish when RP is about *collaborative* story telling.   \n\n\nI know you said you're just here to vent, but if you're willing to see that the problem might be in how you're tailoring your ads, I would suggest changing your starter into 3rd Person, possibly 3rd Person Omniscient. If you don't want \"just two paragraphs\" then ask someone to match you and make it clear you intend to write 3 paragraphs per post. Again, 1st Person writing in RP tends to be more common with newer role players who haven't figured out RP etiquette yet; so you're saying you want 2-3 paragraphs, which are 4 sentences each to be considered a paragraph, that's only asking for 8 - 12 sentences. You're not actually looking for advanced RP in that case, so the more advanced writers are looking your ads over and noping out. What you're getting, and what you're going to keep getting, are the newer writers who want to grow but aren't quite there yet, finding that they can't match you no matter how interested they are *because* your ads are all over the place.",

Or is it just a wall of clunky text swollen with adjectives and synonyms combed from a thesaurus? We all have our own sorts of standards, too, and what I find readable and engaging, someone else might dismiss as too sparse. \n\nI notice, too, that when I write solo pieces, I tend to throw in more quick, back-and-forth dialogue, and that's harder to do in roleplay -- but I don't think it *has* to be. Maybe sometimes you can get into rapid-fire exchanges, and sometimes you can write reams of descriptive scene-setting. It's all about the context. But insisting on a strict word count bars those possibilities. I've found that my favorite partners had a marvelous flexibility to their output, and allowed me to as well, so it was more freeing to go wherever the muse took us. \n\nAlso, you asked about other spots to find partners. I've had some pretty good luck with [Barbermonger](http://barbermonger.me/). It seems to attract a skilled set of writers who spend time crafting their ads and put a fair amount of detail into them, as you do. Best of luck!",

It lends an immediacy to the writing, and I actually used to roleplay primarily in present tense, which again, gave it that more \"real time\" feel. \n\nI do think the prevalent trend in roleplay is to write in third person, past tense, but I don't think it *has* to be the \"standard,\" and I don't think there's One True Way to do it.

Or, rather, everyone is their *own* main character, which of course can get confusing -- probably particularly in group RP, because everyone's running around thinking they're the sole protagonist of their own story!\n\nBut I think with one-on-one, there could be more flexibility, and I've had ideas about trying to tell the same story (as in, the same sequence of events) but told through two different POVs, and I don't see why it *couldn't* be first person. I haven't tried it yet, but the possibilities are there, and honestly, I think in the hands of a skilled writer, any POV or tense is valid. I suppose I just balk at the idea that there are hard-and-fast \"rules\" one should follow. Trends, standards, etiquette, sure, but if you find the right partner and want to get creative, have at it!\n\nFor instance, with one partner I had, we ended up doing a whole scene solely from my character's POV, where she'd write her character's actions as if he were seeing/experiencing them. We just wanted to experiment a bit and see how it worked, but going back to reread that scene, it was pretty seamless, and I don't think it would have been obvious that two different authors had written it.\n\nMy point -- don't be afraid to experiment and bend the \"rules!\"",

And that's definitely one aspect of roleplay that I find frustrating, where sometimes scenes or dialogue will barrel on without my character getting to react or add his/her input. I've done things in the past where my partners and I will go back and edit each other's posts, to insert little reactions/comments from our characters (I'd suggest it ahead of time, of course, and not just spring it on them). I tend to use GoogleDocs primarily, so it's easy to tweak after the fact. So that's one way of working around it. Or, of course, just shortening your posts to allow for more immediate back-and-forth interactions. I think it's easy to fall into this mindset that more text = better, and everyone's so scornful of one-liners.

A lot of the more experienced role players are going to read a starter in first person and say \"absolutely not\" while newer role players are going to be willing to give it a shot. \n\nThe majority of roleplayers who hit novella or higher multi Para standards are writing in third person. OP doesn't have a writing partner. She's looking for one. She doesn't have that openness with someone to build into bending or tweaking. I think that's why the people she wants to attract are skimming clear over her ads.",
