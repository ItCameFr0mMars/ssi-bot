It sounds like they reached out, you said you weren't sure you could do the part justice, they sent a starter anyway, offered suggestions, then you bailed and, later, changed your profile pic and they ended up reaching out again (as you said, they might not have realized you were the same person). And then when you failed to respond, they... didn't bother you further? Sounds more like just bad communication and them not really listening or \"reading between the lines,\" but overall, well, that happens *all the time.* I just kinda ignore that stuff and move on. \n\nBut I *am* glad that with the second iteration, you just said no and left. Good for you for stating your boundaries! Maybe that's the positive to take out of it all. \n\nAnyway, if that's the worst Amino has to offer, I may check it out!",

After they already politely said no. It's not anything extreme but I think sending someone a starter when they told you no and trying to get them to do it anyway is still a bad RPer thing to do. It being about roleplaying real people makes it a little more uncomfortable too imo.",
