            "body": "I had something very similar happen to me. Started an RP in September. Everything was going well. We even talked OOC too and there was never a hint of dislike or wanting to ghost there.   \n\n\nThen in late October / November they stopped replying and I even messaged them a couple of times (like over the course of a few different days, not spamming them every 30 minutes or something) with no response. I assumed it was because \"oh it's holidays, they're just super busy right now, they'll get back to me later\". So I didn't @ them anymore because I assumed that.   \n\n\nAnd then come February, instead of being like \"oh sorry I've gotten super busy lately, I don't have time / I don't want to RP anymore / \\*insert other rp excuses here\\*\" they deleted the server. Just deleted it. And it's made me sad too, because like I said earlier, I had 0 indicators of them disliking it. But I try not to get too hung up on it although it does suck. I like to imagine that they just got super busy and assumed that I had ghosted as well because I hadn't messaged them since November so they deleted the server thinking it was something we agreed on. I know I'm a champion of the \"ghosting is a part of rping\" thing, but it can still suck and hurt sometimes but you can't obsess over it.",

I loved the rps I was in, but I have bipolar disorder. I'll get into rps, do 5 or 10 of them at a time for the months I'm manic, then suddenly I'll fall out and drop off the face of the planet with the same excuses as you hear before I fully disappear when the mania ends and I wind up depressive or overwhelmed. Lots of people have things going on in their life that they'd rather not burden anyone with saying. Or without me hearing something like \"bipolar is just an excuse\". It avoids guilt tripping to keep the rp going. I know it sucks, I've been on the end of being ghosted, but life sucks irl a lot. RP is an escape and sometimes it stops being that. Some people run. Idk man. Lots of people complain on here, but no one owes anyone anything.",
