            "body": "If someone were to say to me: \"You can tell me if you don't like me and just don't want to write with me. We could make this work, only if you wanted to.\" \n\nI would say something along the lines of this: \"You know what? After this conversation I don't like you. You're a cunt. An arrogant, manipulative and entitled little cunt. I don't like or appreciate cunts. So yeah, you're right. I don't like you. And as far as; 'We could make this work, only if you wanted to.' I would rather watch paint dry because that would be far more entertaining and unlike this conversation it would actually be worth my time. So no thank you. Have a good day and take your proposal elsewhere because I'm not interested.\" \n\nAnd after that I would block them so that they couldn't continue to waste my time. I know what I said isn't nice but I hate it whenever people turn the tables on you and try to make you out to be the bad guy. I can't stand it. It infuriates me. \n\nStop wasting your time with these people. You obviously have the experience to pick up on the red flags. And if someone does try to turn the tables on you or gives you little snide earl's don't take it. Throw it right back at them and let them know you are the wrong person to piss off. I used to take all their shit but now I'm the type to be like, \"Hold on a minute. You're not doing that on me and I'm not fucking taking it.\"\n\nSometimes you have to be the nasty piece of work in the situation so that people don't walk all over you. If you let people treat and talk to you however they like then they will treat you like shit because you're allowing them to treat you like shit. Don't stand for it. You are worth more than that. So please don't take it.",

            "body": "Yeah, I definitely could do that, and I often want to...but it would earn me a negative reputation for being rude and an official warning from the mods of the site. Calling someone cunt in my language would probably even get me banned for a while there.\n Honestly, if it was on reddit, I would probably just tell them 'Nah, I don't like you, I don't even know you and you are entitled as fuck, I am going to block you know.'\nBut unfortunately, you can't really block people on that site. They are still in the joined ooc chat, and they still see all of my searches and can comment. And because the community is rather close, being rude  to certain people (especially if they haven't been obviously rude to you, for example calling you names) is going to earn you a bad reputation. \nThat is the frustating thing about it. I have to stay somewhat civil and polite, or people will think that I am the bad guy (especially if they are just passive aggressive and people in the ooc chat don't get why I 'suddenly' lash out).\nOf course I tell them 'Hey, I am not interested in writing this, please read my search again. I don't know you well enough to lie to you so that I don't have to write with you. I don't think this will work out, good luck with your search.' But anything more than that might have negative consequences for me.",
