But people are fickle and there's *something* as the communications evolve that just doesn't sit right for whatever reason. Maybe you're not willing to indulge their secret kink they want to insert or maybe something about your expectations rubs them the wrong way. Maybe they applied to 10 different ads, got 8 replies, and are sorting through to weed down to their top 1-2 from those. Or maybe they're just lazy and looking for someone to set it all up for them and you're not down for that. Anyway, there's a fresh 20 or 30 or 50 ads posted on multiple sites every day, so they're just going to go back to looking for the \"perfect\" fit among those.",

But they only see roleplaying as tiny aspect of a larger social activity, finding friends, talking about fandoms and ooc chatting. That is why I always specify in my ads that while I don't mind socializing, I am primarly looking for roleplays and I dislike talking about my real life.\n\n\\-some people are more into ooc chatting and the planning phase, fantasizing about possible ships and the fandom than actual writing. But if they would write that on their profile or into their searches, nobody would apply, because most people want to write an actual roleplay and not just socialize.

I took a look at her profile (it was on one of these sites where you can see what people have written before, and how many roleplays they are part of, but it is sorted by new so if you don't look closer you just see the ones that were opened last). So I quickly glanced over it, and there was maybe four roleplays, so I thought great, let's start. Except she always just wanted to talk ooc, and every attempt of me to plot anything or invent a story for our roleplay was met with 'Ok/If you want/Hm.. Anyway, I am currently making pizza, do you like Pizza? What is your favourite' or stuff like that.\n\nAfter a whole months of writing, we hadn't gotten started, we had a summary I made up which barely resembled a plot, and she had contributed nothing to it. I took a closer look at her profile, and...none of the roleplays she started had any replies. Often, they were character profiles and maybe a starter the other person had written, but never any character profiles that she created. So basically, all the roleplays that she had were entirely based on the effort of other people, and she never contributed anything while still applying for new stuff. Never mind that in months, she never actually wrote something there.\n\nBehavior like this can make people  little angry, especially if people apply to your search, you get your hopes up, and they never intend to actually write or plot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also chat ooc with my partners all the time, but people who want to go straight to chatting ooc about their personal life, without even checking if your roleplay preferences are a good match, (for example by asking questions about the plot or characters) are often, at least in my experience either people who overshare a lot and make you uncomfortable or people who are use roleplaying sites primarly to look for new friends. \n\nThat is why I always make it super clear in my ads that I am not  looking for too much personal talk in the beginning, and if I get along great with the person later on, great, than we can think about moving to discord. Including this in my search at least seems to scare of the most notorious offenders when it comes to this.",
