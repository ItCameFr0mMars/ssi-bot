            "body": "22 year old here, you're not too old, I've been experiencing the constant battle of finding smut/romance free roleplays since I turned 18 and face claims are so much of a given nowadays you might as well try to draw/use a creation site of sorts. (I still get some partners that don't care for face claims though so they exist and I merrily keep them close.) There's plenty of 18 year olds that don't want smut and let me tell you plenty of those 21+ places are immature ERP fests; where they scream and HFJFJGHHGGG keyboard mash; over some attractive actor for their \"character\". (Totally not fulfilling a fantasy at all.)\nBeing a few years over 18 doesn't equate to \"You're an adult\" in my experience and I say at least give people who are 18 a chance sometime. The reality is that a lot of roleplayers are lonelier people and turn to roleplay to fill a void. Just so happens smut and stuff like that tends to fall into void filling material a lot of the time. All I can say is just keep searching and you'll find someone eventually, it'll just probably take a bit of reposting, and you're bound to get Flakers/Ghosts until then.",

I'm like you, in my late twenties and I remember vividly how easily it was to find other people who wanted to create stories and who actually wrote years ago. I remember when people only engaged in smut if their characters were in an established relationship. I remember when ghosting didn't happen so often (if rl things came up, people went on hiatus and made sure to let everyone know). I remember when finding partners was easy. However, I also remember when it felt like a shift began to happen. Where people slowly started caring more about being mains, appearances, and popularity over actually creating stories. I remember when people started using excuses and hiatus to avoid writing. I remember when communities would get toxic because of ooc drama. I remember realizing that coming across long term partners got just a little more difficult with each passing year.\n\nI don't think we're ever too old for roleplay because it's a hobby and you're never too old for something you enjoy, but I do think the generation we grew up with has thinned out significantly. So the type of things we look for or want are difficult to find nowadays. Even the people in the generations behind us who want similar things have trouble. And it sucks, because I remember a time it wasn't always like this.\n\nI've come to accept this is just how things are nowadays and finding good partners can be a challenge. But they're out there, even if it's just a few. You'll find them if you keep looking, it's just requires an insane amount of patience and determination.",
