My interest in rp died a very slow death over about four or five months until I finally \u2018retired\u2019 from the community I was in. I was still interested in writing, but it took a total new group and setting to revive my interest after several tries at various groups and moving on because they didn\u2019t engage my interests. Im still on the upswing but very slowly, and finding a new group suits better as I feel no pressure or obligations. I think thats part of the key - ensuring whatever you do is at your own pace and something you are genuinely interested in.",

Which we have no complaints about, obviously, it's be an absurdly stressful time.  \n\n\nSometimes taking a dive into a completely different sort of setting or RP style can help shake the rust loose (normally an advanced lit, poster?

I has to allow myself to just be, let go of this unrealistic aspiration to be productive all the time. You seem to do a lot, both in your internal and external life - certainly more than most. Don't be so hard on yourself. The only truly unforgivable part is ghosting your rp partners, dumping them without any explanation and apologies. Over the last year, I happened to find myself on both sides of this situation, and had to quit a rp with a truly worthy partner because I just couldn't focus. It was frustrating, but didn't leave any hurt feelings for either of us, because we've parted amicably. However, I have also been ghosted twice, and both times were simply devastating, way more than an experiences rper like myself could anticipate. I was left feeling like shit. I'm still struggling to get my confidence back, and it's been months. **We are all raw and vulnerable these days. Be kind to yourself, but also be kind to others.**",
