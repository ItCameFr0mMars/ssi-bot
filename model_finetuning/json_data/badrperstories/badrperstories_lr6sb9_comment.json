I think you have to acknowledge that you did nothing wrong and while he could have perhaps been a bit better about it, he didn't really do anything wrong either, he just removed himself from a space he no longer wanted to be apart of. I think we also have to extend folks a bit of grace at this time. With things more in a virtual environment than ever, we get fatigued by the informal and formal rules of the internet and we also, in turn, have trouble with being social. We misread and forget certain internet social queues because it's no longer a \"fun\" space, it's a necessity for work, school, connecting with family, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sucks to lose a roleplayer, it sucks he didn't say bye or take a hiatus, but you have to give folks a break and ultimately, let it go. Again, you're valid in your feelings of frustration - make no mistake - but it probably wasn't anything you or the group did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: your RP sounds cool!
