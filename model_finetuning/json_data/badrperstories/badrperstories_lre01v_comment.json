I'm sorry, I'm just not interested.\" \n\nWe do all start somewhere, but that doesn't mean that every experienced writer is obligated to take the time to guide a new writer along either. Unfortunately, the original post was very vague, so we have no real way of knowing how harsh they were or if it was justified. It also sounds like OP tried to call it off sooner because their partner begged them to, but then the partner didn't change anything at all. It's entirely possible that OP was manipulated until they reached a breaking point, in which case sure we can apply some fault to OP for not being \"mature\" enough to set their boundary and stick to it, but I would assign more fault to the partner for guilt-tripping OP into feeling like they needed to stick around in the first place.",

            "body": "I would respectfully disagree with this argument, predominantly because it's suggesting that giving ultimatums is a proper form of communication while also absolving Subway of all guilt in the situation.   \n\n\nUltimatums have been proven to be a toxic form of communication. By all means, set *boundaries.* Make your wants and needs known early on, absolutely. But that \"my way or no way\" sets a tone where one person's needs are more important than the other's, when RP is a *collaboration.*   \n\n\nIn addition to this, OP tells us that despite them not loving the one-liners, the biggest red flag here is that Subway was demanding more of their time than they could realistically give and doing so in a very aggressive way. One can argue this is exactly why people ghost, which isn't something I agree with, but when faced with a problematic person like this, it can feel like the only option. Do not twist my words, I'm not saying it is the only option, only that it can feel like that. That doesn't necessarily make someone a poor communicator.   \n\n\nIf you were being told you needed to alert someone any time you needed to go afk for more than a half hour, especially in a longer running story, and then factoring in that people have jobs, people have school, people have lives, people need to eat and shit and sleep. Subway was aggressive, possessive, and showing signs they were entitled to OP's time. All of which is toxic, pure and simple. I'm all for openly communicating a schedule if I'm going to be offline for a day or a week, but needing to check in every time I take a dump? Getting belittled because I got side-tracked and didn't post within 30 minutes? Are you kidding? Please, tell me you're kidding.   \n\n\nI will, however, agree with you on the title. Typically anyone who has to preface anything by saying \"I'm the nicest person until\" or \"I'm not an asshole unless\" or whatever variation where they have to tell you they're a positive thing, it's usually because they aren't actually that nice. Initially, I did come into this post aiming to say that, but then I read the post.  \n\n\nLastly, and once again with feeling, we don't know what OP said to Subway, so we can't actually comment, at all, on their communication style or whether or not they were an asshole.",
