            "body": "That is the reason why I sort of always say, less players=good when it comes to forum.\n\nGhosting is always the catchphrase screamed around this subreddit, but when it comes to group RP, it becomes a desease able to kill a functional group, and not just ruin the fun to one player 1\u00d71. Don't get me wrong. Those who plan or are doing an RP with you and then the next day block you and are asking around someone else are hurtful, but when it comes to groups...? Holy hell the things I have seen over the years. A discord group was once on disboard and the general chat was basically people greeting cars at the side of an highway; \n\nEg: \n\nX player joins! \n\nEveryone: welcome!!\n\nX player leaves after 4 seconds\n\nEveryone: ...\n\nBesides that, you would get tons of people most of which are trolls spamming porn, or people who simply didn't even look at the setting or the rules, so you gotta try to make sense of their characters. Or others just dump a character in some area and they sit there.\n\nThen there's the worst kind, the ones who try out the server for a while, then they start getting into the plot, know your characters, perhaps get into a particular scene and then they petrify. Like. They are never going to reply again, the scene doesn't make any sense without them but you gotta roll with it and use that brainwasher on your character because the guy they made friend with is just disappeared in thin air, and then, good luck making sense with the story you planned to include player ghoster in!\n\nSpeaking of which, two admins of my old roleplay group created two nations, before their account will go into an hybernation state that last to this day apparently. Basically our rp was based on four nations fighting each other and two factions and relative leaders are just... Poof. Disappeared, but staying in the server, in a continue AFK state. \n\nThis also gives the server a bad name, as people who joins snoop around the members they seem a bit, find that the last conversation was something under the lines of \"So dead/quiet/silent/bored\" \"Yeah hope we get new members soon\" and no one ever writes anything anywhere. So they yeet out of the place at the speed of sound wondering \"welp, another dead server! Time to join a new one!\"\n\n100 people is an impressive number, but a community like that is hard to mantain, mod and regulate, and if half of it is just a number, I'd rather have it halved.\nPeople still have it at me for having used rp resources to get rid of over 1 year long afk accounts players, but to be honest, why my RP server needs to be a graveyard for dead accounts?",

There are plenty of other sites to use if they just want social interaction or want to find people who like the same fandoms they enjoy. While it's certainly okay to make friends and chit chat on the side, I don't approve of using roleplay groups and sites for that reason only. People are there to write and roleplay when push comes to shove.",

            "body": "Exactly! And we did have some of those!\n\n1 person used the site to self promote after posting two characters that weren't even the species itself, then every post after was commissions or art of something unrelated\n\n1 had two characters in bios which ended up being sold to someone else in the same group, but the OG never took down the bios so it looked like blatant theft until I checked the dates\n\nAnd 2 people currently are exactly the \"well I'm here but now I'm gone\" ones who were so important to the story and characters in some parts of the group, but they both yeeted themselves into the abyss without so much as the courtesy of closing out the RP! One of which essentially traumatized one of our members into being afraid to roleplay again even when she wants to.\n\nWhich might sound silly, but anyone with long term, close to heart RPs will probably understand the pain of being ghosted after setting up a long term ship with a long term character only for the partner to LEAD UP TO, COMPLETE and ENJOY intercourse and proclaim their feelings and mutual desire for kids only to them immediately afterwards ghost again, leaving their character dead asleep and the other left to pick up the pieces over WEEKS of occasional prodding before finally self-replying the end of the relationship and leaving the area, ruining moment, the ship and essentially, the ghoster's character who looks like a jackass that will say \"I love you\" until he nuts, then ignore you after when that wasn't his character at all.\n\nAnd this person of course doesn't come online fucking once in months and first time we see them for a brief window, they don't even respond to a PSA, of which several have been put up and pushed out to all members since we got ownership, so we have to assume they weren't on the same page of being serious about the roleplay like the rest of the group was.\n\nBut their behavior severely hurt the one partner wanting to keep the ship going and realizing she had wasted weeks and months of time for nothing has her afraid to interact again, and I can understand that. There's less than 10 people active a day and most aren't roleplaying as of yet due to time restrictions, and writing blogs takes a while.\n\nI do prefer the fact we lost so many dead accounts, I prefer my smaller group of loyal players but seeing the mess that old leader left us was already too much, nevermind how they failed to keep their group clean by booting dead accounts.",
