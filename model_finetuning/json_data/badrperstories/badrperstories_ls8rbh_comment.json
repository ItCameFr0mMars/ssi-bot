In saying that, this resonates with me from the other perspective, given I've recently done a prune of servers and could potentially see how what I did might be construed in the above way (and I'm silently hoping I'm not said RP partner!).\n\nIt does all come down to communication, I guess. Most times, there's little to be done, but I guess if you still have any means of contacting them, you could reach out with a last ditch message. Worst case scenario, there's no reply and you're in the same position as now. I know if it was any of the servers I pruned recently and I got a message from one of those partners then I wouldn't mind and would totally negotiate. In saying that, however, I'm also the sort who reached out three times and deleted anything where I'd not had any response in three months (IC or OOC) or no notification of someone saying 'I'm going to be gone for &lt;X&gt; months, but I'm still interested'. Very rule-based pruning! Each individual has their own threshold and expectations of activity. \n\nGhosting is immature and disrespectful, imho, but I suppose there's little that can be done about it. Just move onto finding other partners and establishing the boundaries and expectations as best as you can. It's unfortunately something that we as RPers can't always escape, but it just means there was an incompatibility and not that you were at fault in any manner.",
