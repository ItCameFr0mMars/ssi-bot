I was really hooked up by this story and finally you kicked this guy's ass for good! \n\nIt made me laugh to see that he tried to find every excuse possible to get away from that when it was actually impossible XD. I mean it can be interesting to let something happen to your character when it's not death, such as poisoning or torture, as it makes the RP more interesting! Nope, let's do things that cannot be possible and break the rules just to win lol\n\nJokes aside, like I said the story was amazing so I thank you  for sharing it. It really was addicting :D\n\nPs: the bratwurst part made my day lmao",
