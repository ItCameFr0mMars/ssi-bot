I fill like there should be more freedom to people when they join the server so they have the ability to click more; though I do understand the more \u201ctrusted\u201d people get better roles, sometimes you just need to stay around and prove you have in interest in the story to get to the line you want to be! A lot of servers are like this, so I understand the \u201ctrust lock\u201d. Though do you mean even if you are trusted you don\u2019t get the role?",

I hadn\u2019t had to jump through a million hoops to begin with and B. It looked like there was any hope of progression but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case for anyone.
