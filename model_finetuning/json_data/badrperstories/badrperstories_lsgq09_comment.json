My heart hurt for you haha; It\u2019s very anxiety inducing, but to be honest people can be aholes like that when they show they don\u2019t really care for your feelings. Given, it is very easy to forget someone who isn\u2019t actively in your life in stressful situations, no matter how close. \n\n I\u2019m kinda leaning towards ceasing to rp again because a similar, not as bad, situation happened to me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re out here trying to make friends like I enjoy doing when I rp with people. For me, it kinda just makes me feel like I probably wasn\u2019t a good enough partner that they didn\u2019t have the heart to tell me I was bad, and decided to ghost. I take a lot of pride in my writing, especially when it\u2019s a story I\u2019m into. And this rp, I was REALLY into. So them ghosting me kinda left me feeling a little, empty I guess haha. \n\nI kinda coped with it by just letting time pass. Given, I also have my bf who rps with me regularly and he helps me with my insecurities on such.\n\nI hope you feel better about it soon. I would love to be friends with you!",

That being said, if I've been talking to someone for a long time ooc and I promise to let them know I'm all right? I would. It's crappy not to.\n\nLooking for writing partners who click with you can seem like bobbing for apples in a sea of rotten fruit, but I can't tell you to quit or stay because only you know how something is affecting your mental health. I'd say if it's really getting to you, take a break and take care of yourself first. Then, if you are feeling up to it, try again. It's a hobby. It will wait.\n\nThere is a certain radical acceptance I feel that has to come with socializing online. I have come to just accept that people will ghost me and they don't have to give me their reasons. It's courteous if they do, but some people are flaky and some people get insane anxiety over being direct. The important thing to realize is that we kind of gravitate towards blaming ourselves when we face any kind of rejection. The reality is that sometimes it's not anyones fault. Not everyone meshes.

I know this is 100% going to happen at some point.  It's still disappointing and sad.  There's a little bit of a mourning process, if I'm honest.\n\nI've had to change the way I think about RP in general.  I think of it in terms of characters rather than stories now.\n\nIf I was so attached to a story that RPing that particular character with anyone else wouldn't feel right, the RP serves as a jumping off point for a short story of my own.  I'll continuing writing about it until the story reaches a satisfying conclusion.\n\nIf I still want to RP the character, I take bits and pieces from each roleplay to build and their cannon lore.  Sometimes I'll edit things so that a love interest becomes a mentor or their rival become a sibling.  Things like that.\n\nI feel like making my enthusiasm center around evolving a character rather than whatever story a character is currently in makes it much easier to continue roleplaying after my partners are gone.  It might take me a while to jump back in with the same character, but I have several I cycle through which gives me time to feel better about the last one.",
