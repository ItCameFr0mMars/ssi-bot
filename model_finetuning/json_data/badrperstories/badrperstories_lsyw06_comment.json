Basically, he didn't write with them but kept them as back ups, like replacements. It disgusted me so badly. I also witnessed another person start a group with someone, but when more people came along, the second person started ignoring them in favor of others until they left because they were being ignored by practically everyone despite the character they wrote being popular in the fandom. They didn't do anything wrong, they just got overshadowed by the new crowd and nobody seemed to care when they left. It was heartbreaking to see.\n\nI usually leave/remove people who partake in favoritism behavior. It's toxic and I just don't approve of people treating others like this.",

Which is, I mean, whatever- I wouldn't really care- but the second *I* try to do something that has to do with the character's *I'm* writing, I can't even interest people enough to get them to respond to what's going on sometimes. And this could be with ANYthing, honestly- it could be an event/party I want my characters to host to actually *get people to interact with each other,* it could be some kind of drama, or I can introduce some kind of antagonist- for some reason all I do gets ignored? And I really am not sure why they all seem to pick favorites- and rp with each other and leave me out of it?\n\nLike- it also is hypocritical in a way as well. I've pointed this out with them on multiple occasions and said how I felt but this is what they said- maybe 2-3 out of 6 of the people in my friend group said that they \"don't want to rp with my characters because every time they do one of my characters yells at their characters\". And I just sit there like- \"well my characters yell at your characters because your characters give them reasons to and treat them like shit- duh-\", which is genuinely the truth behind it. But the thing I don't get is that they say it \"makes them uncomfy\", which of course I don't want to do, but at the same time, they write the same shit and shit *ten times worst* than the petty drama I write with my own characters- like literally they call MY characters shitty people when the character that is so highly praised and loved in this rp is literally a murderer- like they've genuinely KILLED innocent people without punishment and they are loved and praised by everyone and my characters are considered \"shitty\" because they yelled at someone's character for literally using/abusing one of their friends. I don't understand why people tell me that my character calling out their character for something their character genuinely did is making them \"uncomfy\" when they're over there literally writing &gt;!murder/abuse/self harm/suicide/rape scenes- !&lt;it just doesn't make any sense?\n\nand they're allowed to do everything but the moment I try to write the same kind of stuff I get told \"don't do that-\". They can write the scenes I've mentioned above- but I can't write a scene that has a dirty joke in it- or a sort of emotional scene where I develop my characters more- or something more violent like a bar fight or some more \"rowdy\" scene because it's \"bad\" when they've done worst?\n\nAnd I'm not sure why it's like this- I'm not sure if it's just because they don't like me that much- or if they hate my characters or whatever- but I of course love them as people even if they frustrate me and I have fun when I *am* doing stuff with them- they're like- my only real friends I have so I *don't* want to leave even though sometimes I really feel like I have to- and it kinda sucks. Some nights im sitting there doing nothing and waiting for anyone to interact with me while they all go off chatting in dms about what they're planning on doing without me- and I hate complaining- but sometimes I can't even write a few paragraphs and have people read what I wrote at least\n\nidk why some people when they rp don't try to include everyone- it sucks to be that person who isn't included- it really does suck so much to try so hard to be included but not even get interactions at all. I know people would feel upset and frustrated if they were in this situation, so I don't get why they want to put others into the situation.\n\nit's a bunch of shit that sucks ass",

We're all doing this for fun, so I don't personally vibe with the whole \"well you're the owner, so you have to\" when I have two other staff members whose muses vibe perfectly with that player.   \n\n\nTo that, I would say it has NOTHING, at all, to do with the player's character being awful, and it doesn't even have much to do with the player's writing capabilities. It's just a matter of personal chemistry, and sometimes there just isn't any.   \n\n\nMy personal writing style is up the ass with introspection, and I didn't realize that was a problem until I was put into a scene with another player that had that same writing style. Our characters were just there, thinking things, and doing nothing. Since then, I've been really working on putting more actionable content into my posts, because, for me, I saw that as a flaw and I wanted to fix it. But there's a lot of role players out there who don't see it as a flaw, they love exploring the shit out of what their character is feeling and sort of taking on a passenger's seat role in the scene.   \n\n\nI've learned that I cannot do scenes with writers like that. It's no shade to them, it just doesn't speak to my muse. Similarly, I've seen writers that do scenes together where both of them are trying to be the \"drivers\" and then the whole scene devolves into a \"no, we did this\" \"actually no we did this instead.\"   \n\n\nI would guess that maybe a good exercise would be to identify your personal writing style and then seeking out servers that have writers in it with styles that compliment yours. It might just be that the people in this server you're in all have writing styles that are similar enough to yours that they know a scene with you won't give them the content they need for their muse to stay inspired. That doesn't mean you're not an inspiring writer, it just means your styles are too similar. Think of it like every muse is a magnet. If your magnetic pole is the same as someone else's, logically you might think \"oh we're so similar, we should get along great,\" but instead you end up struggling to make something work because your muses are pushing you away from one another. It's great to find a story with a lore you vibe with, but if everyone in it has the same pole as you, it's not going to be fun.",

I know if I see someone being left out I\u2019ll approach them. Just know not everyone can see these things and people can\u2019t read minds. I have autism so other people on the spectrum and some people with ADHD have a hard time noticing when someone is being neglected. Just talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be responded to if your open and clear\n\nIf you maybe need assistance you can send your characters to me, or a sample do writing; whatever you seem to think might be the issue and not catching people\u2019s eyes and I can assist you! \n\nAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t appeal to everyone and that\u2019s okay.

That\u2019s a separate reason though. One of which I don\u2019t want to go on about here. \n\nEnd up intimidating the majority of the people in which causes me to solo rping in hopes someone happens to drop by. Eventually, I'll get desperate and just rp with anyone who responds to my ping and that's usually the one-liner everyone avoids or limits rp time with. \n\nGroup rps are catered towards people who can be social and grow with people, writing and personally. Unfortunately, that doesn't work with people who are loners, no friends, and limit ooc interactions as much as possible. This can be said for 1x1 too. If you don't have those qualities then why even bother going out of your way to rp with other people when you could just make your own story?\n\n\nYou'll feel ignored when style and storylines don't match. You can try to solo rp to get a scene going on and hope others will join or invite your other rp friends into the group. But if they don\u2019t wanna join then well maybe it\u2019s time to look for another rp group to join. Would they even be bothered if you left? If they don't want to rp with you for long then probably not.\n\nMaybe it's just me being cynical about this. Roleplaying made me jaded overtime.",

I prefer them over 1x1 because I like the curveballs and twists a plot can be given by multiple people but this is oh, so very common. I hope you can find one you can feel comfortable in! The newly started ones can be a lot of fun as you really can have a chance to see how well you vibe with the other members.\n\nI try to always ask about other's character's too cause I know the feeling of being excited over what you made and then not having someone else to talk to it about. Or when it's only after you join that you get the cold shoulder. Maybe because you're 'locked in' or something but it does feel like they don't like your characters when it happens enough times.",
