The worst part, for me, was that these people considered themselves to be super open-minded, but they only accepted me not writing it when I had a reason they approved of. Like, they seemed to know: Yeah, some people are ace, these people might not want to write it, and I am super tolerant, therefore, I shouldn't force it if people tell me they are ace. But if I did not have a 'good' reason, they were like 'Ah yes, so you are secretly interested, I will know proceed to teach you how to write it, don't worry.' \n\nAnd of course, this definitely happens, even more often I assume. Most people just leave if they finally get that there is really no chance in this world that you maaaybe will write it later on. The worst sentence in this context is 'Well, we will see if we will write it when we get there :P'",

I think people forget characters aren't vehicles for fulfilment to some--there are many writers that see their OCs as people and have respect for them as such, and not having that same vibe from the other person, or if they use the OC as a replacement for themselves, just makes it way too complicated and awkward.\n\nThere will be others! Just because the one YOU are hungry for doesn't jive with your OC doesn't mean you're hated or the OC is bad. I just.... Oof.\n\nAnd excuse me, but if the mask comes off at ALL then that's a BIG FUCKING DEAL so might as well get used to it.

They were just wanting to jump to where they were in a relationship without any of that build up.\n\nThe other example was with a character of mine who's ace, which caused all discussion of plotting to grind to a halt when I mentioned his sexuality. It was also a bit awkward because they assumed my character would be open to a mxf plot. For all they knew, he could have been so gay that the rainbow turned into a perpetual circle of rainbowiness.\n\nExactly my thought! Not to mention, Mando was tasked with the safeguarding and delivering of The Child to his people. Since they were wanting The Child to be in the RP, too, I just couldn't see how romance would even happen since he'd be focused on his task.",
