I am not a 1x1 player but a group player, and it occurs to me to at times write multiple paragraphs, explain romantic inner thoughts, intricate action scenes, magical rituals and yada yada, but at times it occurs to me that I cannot find anything to say, so I just speak as I would in a normal casual conversation with friends, at times kinda one-lining. \n\nTo me the whole deal with matching is indifferent, if I get something to play with or to reply to, or I find the other person is being amusing to read, to me there's no problem regardless how much my fellow player gave me to read. Roleplay is not a minimum-120, maximum-180 words school essay, it's about being able to collaborate and give out a compelling and amusing interaction that turns into a story.\n\nIf you are having fun replying, and feel like you did a good job, just send it if you do not have anything else to add, and forget about the length for a second and just press enter. You'll have other moments you will be inspired to be lengthy and make your writing skills shine, don't let your thoughts restrain you or your fun. I am sure your partner is not using a word counter when they decide to reply to you or not, regardless you write less or much. That's my humble take over it. \n\nI don't find you undesirable, but this is only my opinion.",

            "body": "I wouldn't sweat it if no one has complained. \n\nI say no single paragraph writers in my posts, but it is for those who primarily only write single paragraph or do the majority of the time. There are times in conversation where the words and all the nuances of the character only add up to a heavy paragraph. Nuances meaning for example slight movements, expressions, breathing, the shift eyes or stance. I have no problem with partners doing the same. \n\n\nWhat I -hate- is when people who are clearly only single paragraph writers try to force themselves to do more. There is nothing wrong with being a single paragraph writer in itself, they just aren't the right partner for me. The problem comes when they try to force themselves to write more. \n\nA very rare few will show clear effort in trying to learn how to add length beyond inner monologue and words. Those I actually try to help. I'll casually ask them oocly for added info like what time of day is it, what's the temperature like, expression and body language, atmosphere sounds like birds or insects, etc. Those of they are making a genuine effort to improve and give me detail I will try to stick around. \n\nThe majority I run into unfortunately try to action or passage of time without permission. It is a pet peeve of mine when someone does something major, moves past it and onto something else. An example might be someone doctoring an injury likes cleaning, stitching, bandaging or a scene where they are kidnapping a character and go through a small vacation worth of travel in one post. By passing through so many actions it deprives me of an opportunity to react and change the scene. In a way, I'm forced to accept action 1-4 because they've automatically moved onto 5. So if I accept that \"reality\" then it limits what I can do and handcuffs me. What if my character is scared of needles and royally freaks out? Can't do that if you successfully finished it right? What if my character bites your ear, screams at a passerby, kicks at the door to the cab or even says something that might have given your character pause. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, don't stress so much about it if the content isn't always long. If your partner mentions it just nicely ask for suggestions on how to add length or detail. If they don't and seem happy, keep being awesome. \u2764",

If someone gives me something to work with, and I enjoy the thread, that is all I need.\n\nI'm more upset about the idea that it's only acceptable to match length and I'm taking longer to come up with more detail filler introspective thought. It often leads into too many micro movements and kills it for me.\n\nI know many people will disagree with me. If your rp partner has a problem I'd hope they'd talk to you so that you can work something out. But from my own perspective, I just want a compelling story that I can continue on from, whatever that may be. So four sentences or four paragraphs, it's fine by me.",
