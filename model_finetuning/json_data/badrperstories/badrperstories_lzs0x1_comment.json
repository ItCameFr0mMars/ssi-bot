It would be more of issue with their posting frequency than the other rps. I'm fine with breaks for rl issues (as long as it isn't chronic and excuse after excuse), but if they are taking breaks to write with others... Nope.

To add a layer of a double standard do the situation, their character was in a polyamorous relationship and they'd list all their 'favourites' in their RP bio. So they could write with anyone they wanted, but wanted to have me for themselves exclusively. It ended with them being bitter to see me with someone else and removing me. It was such a relief they were gone without me having to make the step to cut ties, honestly. If I knew how much better it is going to make me feel when they're no longer pestering me, I would've done this myself.",
