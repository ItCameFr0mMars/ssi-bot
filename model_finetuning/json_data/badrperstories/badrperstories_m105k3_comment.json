Lets tell the class the parts you gleefully neglected to mention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. We do in fact have an entire section on the differences made between canon and what we changed for balancing! It is not our fault you did not find it in you to take the time to read this section to where it is noted that Ark was indeed powered down. \n2. You joined the server telling us how you were gathering info from the wiki due to not having seen the show! Whether you meant in its entirety or partially is your personal decision.\n3. If in the aforementioned point that you had not indeed watched, and solely pulled your info from the Wikipedia page, or friends for knowledge, then it is entirely on you for not knowingly pointing out, or adding Ark to your sheet if you knew it was something they inherently had. \n4. The reason this is an issue and can't \"just be added\" to your sheet, is to stop people from metagaming their character to have some specific power that would counteract another role players sheet and messing with their fun in the role play.\n5. If you HAVE watched the anime/read the manga, then it is STILL on you for not pointing it out at the time of making your sheet. Shocker, us staff have a life to live and with the current state of affairs in the world, it is possible we have MISSED something.\n6. We explained this to you and yet you STILL pressed the issue like a child not being allowed to have the ice cream cone after asking for the brownie instead.\n\nIf you are going to write a \"horror story,\" at least give everyone the facts about what happened, not your unbiased opinion. We removed you for violating rules which we had laid out and were easy enough to access in the \"Rules\" channel. If it seemed cliquey to you, that is your personal opinion. We often voice chat to talk about games and our daily lives, like people who are friends/want to make friends do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world isn't about you sweetheart.

Now as a medical professional dealing with covid I am sorry you had to wait a bit for your character to be looked at. I even apologized for it and stayed up the morning I got off work to help deal with anything wrong with your sheet and get you approved. Now, the way you treated my staff was uncalled for and that is why you were banned. I am behind them 100% in my absence which is a majority of the time when I work. The reason our server is set up the way it is, is for ease for the staff as well as the members. We will gladly debate issues that arise or something that you want to put in your sheet, but once disrespect has arises such as telling my staff to \u201cdo better\u201d is an insult. I am sorry that you felt like you had to write such a review and trashing me when I was not even present, but at least put the facts or what happened and you were upset you didn\u2019t get your way. \n\nWe also are all for letting people back in the server of amends want to be made. But it seems that isn\u2019t an option for you at this time based on trashing someone that was nothing but nice. Thanks.",

Is there an issue with gathering info from the wiki? Don't really know why you're making this point. Whether someone sees the show or not, the wiki helps when you're confused about something.\n3. At the time of character creation, would it not be wise to confirm with the roleplayer? Ensure that they have what they want to be written down? \"Hey, you don't have Ark listed on your sheet. Before I accept this, do you want to make sure you have it?\"\n4. Yeah, I understand this. But here's where we can accommodate things. You explain that because you want to mitigate metagaming, you can't just add it to your sheet without any approval. However, **you are a staff member.** There is no reason you cannot explain, \"I will allow you to edit your character to add it if it's that important to the character.\" Which, should be feasible, if they're not too far into the roleplay.\n5. Yeah, staff have lives. I'm all about lives first, roleplay second. but it's possible **both** missed something in that case. It's a two-way street.",
