Now, the person who has newly contacted me and I have not interacted with much outside of borderline begging them to contribute an idea to a plot? The person I got to nearly pull teeth to get to write with no input or context from them? I don't feel nearly as guilty. I'll feel a little guilty, but it's not like we are close (or in that case, even writing for that matter.) \n\nI'm not saying the last scenario makes the ghosting any less avoidant behavior or healthy.
