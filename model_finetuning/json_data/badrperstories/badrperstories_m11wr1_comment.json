Yes, sometimes I\u2019ll write essays if I\u2019m trying to explain some kind of lore point, or giving information that someone\u2019s character may know (so I don\u2019t automatically assume they do or don\u2019t know something). Otherwise, giving too much actionable content in one go just makes things disjointed and awkward.\n\nBut you\u2019re totally right in that some people don\u2019t understand this ideology. And I\u2019m not actually sure how to get that point across in ads, I\u2019ve just been lucky with partners for the most part.",

It's frustrating when someone then consistently writes way, way more anyway, especially when it's things I can't reply to.\n\nAnd sure, there's always the \"you don't have to match my length!\" but I'll be honest, if I'm writing with someone and their replies are always significantly longer than mine, it makes me feel inadequate, or like I'm not doing enough.

I see so many people talk about post length preferences and word count, but I've never had a problem being someone with variable post length and it puts me off that there are people that will snub you because you only write a few sentences at a time, regardless of reason (time, creativity, work, preference, etc), even though you're still interacting with the situation, and providing a chance for a counter action.\n\nIf they're gonna be on my ass about length, I can happily cut my response time in half and pad out my replies with useless fluff to meet the length requirements, but don't expect me keep up with rapid responses or even stick to the roleplay when I have to force writing that doesn't suit the environment or character.\n\nQuality&gt;quantity\n\nEven a one-liner can be good if it's relevant dialogue or it's expected the other player has more to say but gave pause for reaction.",
