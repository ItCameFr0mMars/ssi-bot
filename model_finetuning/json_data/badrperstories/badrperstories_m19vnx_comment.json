He was on a quest to find a way to cure himself (it was a magical, made up disease). That was sort of a side thing, though, because he was also traveling with a small group helping them with *their* goals.\n\nWe ran into a rando who offered to just up and heal my character. I was like, \"Um, no?\" But I had to do so OOC, because my character would have obviously accepted the instant fix. This was a freeform setting, if that matters.\n\nPeople who offer to have their character snap their fingers and fix all your characters' problems for them simply aren't considering what's fun for you. They're not considering that the obstacles and handicaps a character has to overcome or face contribute to who and what they are. Which is wild, because why would you make a character a certain way if you didn't want them to *be* that way? With the exception of growing as a person and overcoming actual fixable flaws or hang-ups, of course.",

When you get into the description of hand movements, it can be a challenge to describe them in physical orientation.\n\nFor communication, she uses signs. Some are ASL based and some aren't. She has a vocabulary list and the signs I use for them. If I make up new ones, I write them down. Consistency in the different words is important for others to understand and grasp what she's trying to communicate. Once they learn what a sign means then they can recognize it and that can be built on. If you aren't consistent then they get easily and understandably frustrated. \n\nIt does take the right partner as it's almost a puzzle. On the more challenging signs to write, I might have a few ASL gifs to share in the rp media channel to give them a visual if they struggle. Hope that helps. \u2764",
