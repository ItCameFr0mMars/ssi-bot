Nothing wrong with that. \n\nBeing female, I don't have a problem playing a small-time plot character that's male. Some of my female characters are even introduced with male side characters. All that said, I have zero desire to play a male as a main character. Zero. Nada. Zilch. \n\nIt doesn't even have anything really to do with sexuality or smut, I just don't do it any justice and being a woman I know how everything works and feels, not just physically but other aspects too. The whole PMS , it's a joke to some, but legit for many it is absolutely accurate. As you get older, you often can tell when things are a more normal reaction and what is hormones. But those \"crazy\" hormones are absolutely legit and it can be like a switch flipping. It can be hard to identify with that. You can imitate it, but experiencing it in yourself helps to realize. The way women communicate, think can be vastly different as well. \n\nPeople might argue that I'm not challenging myself as a writer by being so closed minded... Eh, I'm here to write and enjoy a hobby. I'm not interested in competitive writing.",

Maybe it's because I stick to writing canons, but I always pick my characters based on their personality, what would seem most interesting to write, not what sex they are. The whole point of RP for me is to write someone I'm not, and I tend to thrive with characters that are very different from me; I find it more challenging and rewarding. I'm also a little puzzled as to why you and the other person couldn't both play characters of the same sex (both males or both females)? Unless these are all m/f romance RPs.\n\nI understand people having their preferences though, everyone can write what they like, nothing wrong with that.

I use to only play as females because of the same reasoning that \u201cI can better understand my characters with the same gender.\u201d I started to play as a male when my rp group was just playing females, we needed more males so that\u2019s what happened. And I gotta say it\u2019s really fun. It was fun because I get to create a male oc, give them a personality, look, and backstory. I think the problem is that some people playing characters of the same gender doesn\u2019t want to play the opposite character and portray a male/female character shittily. Especially for men since they get the most backlash for it I.e r/menwritingwomen. \n\nThere's a tip for this and what I give to others who want to try writing characters from their opposite gender: personality. Put two of the same personalities (for example, a happy-go-lucky person) to a male and female, play as them. Does any change between those characters? No, and it shouldn't since they act similar to each other, even if you switch genders nothing much should change. What I'm trying to say is personality matters more than gender unless there's a story/plot you want gender to be an important factor. \n\nBut at the end of the day, people are gonna play who they want. Do you wish that everyone would be willing to play the opposite of their gender, yeah but that's unrealistic to expect that from them. As long as they're a decent person and rper I don't mind their preferences.",

I just don't feel that comfortable playing a male I suppose because I feel like I play them too feminine? if that makes sense. In today's age, this might come across as very backwards but I feel like my male characters are either too stereotypically masculine or they act more like females. There's nothing wrong with a dude that's more feminine, but generally speaking guys minds tend to think differently from  women.\n\n Similarly, I've noticed people who have an aversion to playing anything other than same-sex romances (exclusively mxm, never gxg or gxb. gxg is a little rare unfortunately :( ) And often times, it's played by females heavily stereotyping gay relationships. Not sure if that's died down or not, but I don't think the yaoi seme uke thing will ever disappear. So it's kinda understandable in that regard why someone wouldn't want to do the same to the opposite gender.",

So if someone applies and lets you write M, they should better be ready to write a female main character and multiple female side characters. And they should provide a well-thought out story as well. That is nothing for someone who has no experience with writing women and wants to try it for the first time.\n\nSorry, but it in that case, it is simply impossible to find someone who usually would write a M character to write all these female roles, especially if they would get nothing out of it. So they should provide a good story, write multiple characters and write multiple characters of the opposite sex even if it does nothing for them, make their character fulfill your characters sexual needs all the time...and what should they get out of it? To become better at writing, by writing smut roleplays?",

However, I\u2019m not about to ask someone to apply to my role play just for experience or to become a better writer as that makes little to no sense and they wouldn\u2019t get anything out of it. The point of my post, was that even when I can find a writing partner and we discuss certain plots, I have a hard time playing as M because of the above reasonings. I\u2019m not about to force someone to write someone they won\u2019t enjoy. I put out less ads and answer to even less because I want to play a myriad of characters, and not just a woman who looks like myself.
