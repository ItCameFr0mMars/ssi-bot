They will always lean on you if they're enjoying themselves while letting you do all the work. Humans just like what is comfortable for them, and it takes a LOT of introspection and work to change. If you've seen the player that likes to sit and complain that there's no rp, yet doesn't actually make moves to engage, they're similar. Those people tend to always be stuck in the same rut as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNowadays if I find a partner who is annoying me like that (and one of my friends is atm, actually), I just move on. It can be hard, esp if I like the person, but the rp in the end just isn't what I'm enjoying. Everyone deserves to hope for mutual enjoyment. Sometimes if I dont want to let go, it helps just to have a few different partners around so I can go to xyz for whatever else I want.",

Every once in a while they will piss and moan that they can't get any \"good RP\", but then put zero effort into actually getting it.\n\nWhat I'll often do in this situation is ask, prior to the scene starting, for suggestions *from them.* On plot, on characters, on world building, etc. If they just shrug and say \"idk\" or \"I have no ideas\", then I know they aren't going to suddenly start doing so during the scene. If that's what I'm looking for from the scene, then I know they won't be a good partner.\n\nOn the flip side, though, I've also been in situations where my partner cares way, *way* more about the setting than I do. They'll talk for literal *hours* about shit like the sociopolitical climate of a fictional country, while I'm sitting there just thinking \"dude we're doing a one shot fetish scene. Who cares?\" so it definitely goes both ways. Really depends on the specific situation.",

She just couldn't drive story on her own? So I was her xbox really, and all about her convenience. She even just shrugged and said she didn't drive plot when I tried to bring up to her why I had lost interest in playing with her.",

They may even have their own plans for once your story arc is finished.  These people are usually pretty good about stepping up once you talk to them because they felt they were *letting* you take control of the story.  However, they're rare so I wouldn't count on it.\n\nBut, also, I think it's worth noting that this seems more like a difference in style than in contribution.  I think you're just looking for two different types of RP where one of you is more interested in character dynamics and the other is more focused on storytelling.  There's a good chance your partner would have preferred that you also stuck to inner dialogue mixed with more conversation.\n\nIf you're not already, I think it might help if you lay out your expectations for your partners up front.  It's never good to assume your partners will have the same perspective as you.  You've got to really spell it out for people.",

I feel like people bend over backwards to sympathize with people who are ghosted (usually without the full context) while no one considers that maybe the person on the other side is just as emotionally drained from always having to be the adult in the writing partnership  -  because yes, it is a partnership. And yes, it gets tiring to pull teeth to get your partner to take any initiative.  \n\nThat's not me defending all ghosts either. Some people are just jerks. Totally deserve the bad rap.
