The owner stated that she didn't care and it \"wasn't an excuse to hold up scenes\").\n\nIn what world is illness/mourning not an excuse for needing to take some time off RP? JFC\n\nAlso, in what RP is it that someone is banned for not posting, instead of just having their character backgrounded/ignored while the scene proceeds otherwise? \n\n&gt;-The owner getting upset about...\n\nSounds like the owner was looking for a personal fanclub, not an RP group.\n\n&gt;-A departures channel where everyone was free and often encouraged to make fun of players who left (this is where I witnessed a mod calling a player autistic for joining and leaving a few times).\n\nThis reminds me of a shitty D&amp;D group where the mods would ban anyone who left \"without giving a reason\". Literally one of their rules was you couldn't leave the server without saying why. So people would pop on, take a look around and then decide it wasn't for them and leave. The mods would then ban them and deride them in a channel dedicated especially to bans. Hope they enjoyed that petty power trip. \n\n&gt;removing around 99% of her entire player base due to one of these reasons and more that I can't even recall off of the top of my head. This lead to her having open temper tantrums in the out of character chat room about inactivity and\n\nlol the irony",

I believe some players DID request that they be skipped in order to let the scenes move forward, but they were banned for inactivity anyway despite that and posting a leave of absence notice.\n\nI do believe the owner was 100% in it for all the wrong reasons, including having a fan base not an RP group. It was pretty clear that all of the mods played shameless self inserts and a lot of their own self esteem in real life was centered around their roleplay, which is very sad to me.

Sometimes the Owners who make people into mods are people who share a similar mindset because no sane mod would last in there without getting bullied out. But it\u2019s most likely those mods are her friends and that leads to bias and circle jerk behavior.\n\nShe can\u2019t realize that her actions have consequences. Lack of empathy and patience for people in unfortunate circumstances, insulting members and badmouthing them when they leave, forcing others to erp and interact with you and they wonder why the server is dead as fuck. If she\u2019s so concerned about nobody rping with her she should just rp with her circle jerk mods or herself. Or better yet, she should just write a book.
