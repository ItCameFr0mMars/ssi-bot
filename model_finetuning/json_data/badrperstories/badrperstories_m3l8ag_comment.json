I can't RP with someone who only provides one line dialogue, doesn't contribute to the story, and is too over powered to work with. I won't find it fun, and I don't want to end up dropping the roleplay if you're enjoying it, so I'm not going to make one to begin with. If you want to RP, I suggest you ask someone else that is okay with your style. Thank you.\"\n\nPublic or private, depending on how he approaches you first.

When you put effort in to write a detailed, well-written post, but your partner can't be assed to do more than give a single line in response, it's extremely disappointing. Nobody could fault you for that.\n\nIt's perfectly normal and healthy to have minimum rules in place to prevent exactly this issue -- nobody but other one-liners want to roleplay with one-liners, and I myself will actively disengage from scenes/servers in which I'm expected to play with them.\n\nIf he asks to join you and your friend again in the future, be firm. Insist he give longer and more detailed posts on par with the rest of the group. If he refuses, then turn him down. It sucks to exclude people, but it also isn't fair to you that your fun time should be harmed by someone's lazy desire to write tiny, tiny posts.",
