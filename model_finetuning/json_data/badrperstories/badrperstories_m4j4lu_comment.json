It may have started as rp, but then that threshold to RL was crossed. \n\nThat being said, I'm sorry that happened to you. Dating online is very risky and you can never be sure of what is the truth. It is a very common story that people online will lie, Just be glad you didn't lose a bunch of RL money to it. I hope you blocked her and cut ties, don't waste another second on it and use it as a teaching experience for the future.",
