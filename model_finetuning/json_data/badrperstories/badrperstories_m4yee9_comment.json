            "body": "I would definitely advise against adding meaningless fluff, ever. It's not fun to write, and it's not fun to read.\n\nYou say you don't have the enthusiasm for the RPs you're in. Do they feel like a chore? Is that the reason you prefer 1-2 liner posts -- to quickly get posting out of the way so you can move on and do something else? If this is the case, the problem is that you don't care enough about the RPs you have right now. Writing multiple paragraphs for something you're not interested in is a complete drag.\n\nIf you find you generally just have a better time when everyone is writing shorter posts, then that's just it: shorter posts are your thing. There's nothing in the world wrong with that; it's just a personal preference. The answer is to find partners and RPs that are into the same posting style.\n\nIt sounds like you're not incapable of writing longer posts, and to be frank, I don't usually advise people to write bigger (read: fluffier) posts just to keep up with others. When you're adding crap to a post just to add it, it shows. So does the lack of enthusiasm. There's a ton of advice I and other people could give you to be more descriptive, but it doesn't sound like that's the issue. It sounds like either a) you just like to write short posts (which is fine!) or b) you're not into the RPs you're currently doing.\n\nFor a lot of people, length comes with enthusiasm, so you might have to start there. What's killing your enthusiasm for the RPs? Do you wish something was different? Don't care about your character(s)? Just not into it? If there is something you wish you could do, add, or write about, bring it up with your partner. Just say something like, \"Hey, do you think we could have this happen next in our plot?\" Or, \"Do you think we could summarize/speed through this afternoon tea scene?\"\n\nIf writing the longer posts is what's killing your enthusiasm, you can try asking, \"Hey, I hope my shorter posts aren't bugging you. I've found it's my preference to keep it short and sweet.\" For a lot of partners who prefer longform, this is gonna be a dealbreaker. And that's fine! Part of RP is finding the people you mesh with as a writer. Just be civil and upfront about it.",
