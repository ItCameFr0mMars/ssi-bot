Take some time to seek other ways that you can get your writing fix and if the mood strikes again then continue the hunt for new partners!

I'm currently struggling with the fact my group of RPers I mainly do stuff with just.... don't include me in other stuff they want to do.\n\nThat's not to say I demand to be included in every big thing they're involved in. But if I say I'm always down for a Star Wars RP, then I find out that they went and joined one behind my back and never invited me, it kinda hurts. And its not 1x1 things either its always groups so I know for sure I could have gotten an invite if someone had given a shit. Nothing quite like the feeling of \"If you quit RP then I'd quit too!!!\" and then finding out that person took a friend of yours and went to a bunch of RP servers that you would have wanted to go too and is posting with people in all kinds of RPs every other day and then you've been stuck waiting two months for a post.\n\nAnyway. Sorry for the ramble. Just wanted to rant about dishonest RP friends.\n\nSome days I've felt like quitting this hobby of ours as well. I've been at this for 15 years now. So I definitely feel the desire to just quit and walk away. Do something else that's productive with my time. I recommend taking a break of a few months to recharge your batteries if you're still uncertain on if you want to fully quit. That's the best advice I can give before you officially quit this hobby.",
