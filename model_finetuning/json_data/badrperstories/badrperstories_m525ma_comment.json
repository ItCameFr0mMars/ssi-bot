I'm a woman and honestly about 95% of my bad rp experiences were with other women. \n\nMy one distinct bad experience with a guy roleplayer though was a couple years ago when I found out this guy I'd been writing with was stalking some of my other social media accounts, and had been sharing screenshots of my personal posts with his friends. That same guy had, at an earlier time, been convinced he was in a relationship with this other female RPer, announced it to the whole community that she was his girlfriend, and then became very aggressive and obsessive when she said that wasn't the case. Guess I should've seen that as a red flag lol.\n\nI'm sorry you guys get a bad rap. Unfortunately I don't know what can be done about it at this point, except don't be one of those guys (which it seems you aren't.) But if someone says they're not comfortable writing with men, you have to respect that, and I'd also stop pretending to be a girl if you haven't already, as that won't help matters at all.",

Don\u2019t know the difference between IC and OOC. Push for smut, or push fetishes in even what should be a SFW theme. Many try to god mode in a variety of ways, much more than I\u2019ve seen woman do so. They\u2019ll bully other guys in an attempt to get the ship they want in group settings. Many try to date their RP partner. \n\nI could honestly go on. And I\u2019m not saying woman aren\u2019t free from their own problems. Many try to push ships too, but its rarely an OOC line blur, just simply character wish fulfillment. \n\nBasically, an unknown female is safer than an unknown male, and for those who\u2019ve been burned so may times before, it\u2019s an unnecessary risk trying to take on a male partner.",

I think, unless you've experienced it yourself, it's hard to imagine just how widespread and common issues are.  Guys wanting pics, guys sending you unsolicited pics, trying to get trick you into indulging their fetishes both ic and ooc, using rp as a cover to try to date you, \"falling in love\" with you after a week of writing, asking inappropriate questions, even stalking people.\n\nHonestly, presenting yourself as a girl in order to bypass someone's boundaries for your own gain is something that falls into creepy behavior men do.  You might think it's ok because your intention isn't to be a creep and you just want to rp, but it's not.  The entitlement you're showing by doing this is exactly why they don't rp with men.  You're actively being part of the problem you want to solve by doing this.  This isn't an attack on you.  I understand that it's hard to see from the other side.  It's just something you need to be aware of and maybe reflect on.\n\nHere's all you can really do: Find partners who are ok with playing alongside men.  You might need to branch out and find your rp somewhere else than you're used to.  It might be a different sort of server, a different platform, or even just different places to post your ads.  Alternately, do more roleplay with other men.  And then call out other guys on the bad behavior you see.\n\nAlso, I don't actually know the irl gender of some of my rp partners.  There's nothing stating that you have to disclose that information.  If someone says they don't rp with men, you still have to respect it.  But if that's not mentioned anywhere, you don't have to offer up your personal information.  It's ok to stay anonymous online.",

So my experiences are that I have a lot more horror stories with female role players than I do male role players. Especially on the site I often use for searches, which also tends to be more women than men.\n\nIf you search for things that tend to have more men interested in it or get more men messaging you, you would have more horror stories that way and vice versa.\n\nI had a woman straight block me not too terribly long ago as soon as I said I didn't write beastiality and underage characters. Where as most men I come across never question those limits. Or my general idea on I'm not writing pure smut. I've only had one guy I had to stop roleplaying with because where he accepted my no underage limit but didn't seem super pleased with it. Not aggressively so, but it still made me very uncomfortable knowing that limit wasn't one we shared.\n\nI think it's just some people running into one gender with more issues than the other. Personally, I don't tell anyone I don't role play with a certain gender and if I cut women out I wouldn't have anyone to role play with.",

Somebody is grieving their dead mother? Yep, sex should help!

I personally find a lot of the most popular rp plots very boring in my area, but they rarely agree to anything else and if they do they do the very bare minimum as if they'd rather be anywhere else rn. And the way I'd see it, enthusiasm is necessary for my rping-disinterested partners are a huge buzzkill.\n\n\nBesides that, I am in rp spaces that are often low on male characters (think animal rps like warriors) so I often just play the masculine characters myself as I have no problem doing so. So combine that with men irl rpers being really obnoxious most of the time, and me just replacing the need for male ocs in an rp, and most of the time there's no real reason to actively include men instead of excluding them, sadly to say.",
