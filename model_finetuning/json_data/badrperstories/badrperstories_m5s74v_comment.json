            "body": "You know some partners take and take and never have any interest in cutting someone else any slack. Dude sounds like a total dud or a diva. He's playing games and it's funny because he's rather shoot you both in the foot than move on after (IMO a minor) break in your RP. I'm sorry you found out who you're writing with is a dick though. \n\nCut your losses. A good RP partner (and person IMO) isn't going to play mind games or get passive-aggressive when things aren't perfect. We are all people with lives outside of the internet. I love chatting with my partners and I'm at the age where I don't even bother asking for a post. If someone wants to and has time, they will. Otherwise I am happy to assume life is busy for them. I'm not here to mother someone to post. I do worry and I do like an active OOC but I also don't force it if they're not taking the conversation bait.\n\nI don't know what MH means. Mental health? Well the majority of us have that in some scope so unless he's taking active steps to get over what's going on in his head, it's not your job to give yourself to him as a therapist or mother or whatever. It sounds tough but I was with an emotionally abusive RPer for years and I gave up so much of myself to make him happy. He always wanted me to post to him before anyone else (we were on a public forum back in the day) and he'd creep to see what I was doing with other people. Don't let your partner drag you down. Give as much as you feel you can but then no more. I walked away from the guy after I had a huge loss in my life and couldn't be around for 2-3 weeks, I told him in advance I needed time offline. He lost his mind and I decided if he was a friend, he would have comforted me instead of whining about not being able to write together. So I ghosted him happily and have since then, stuck up for myself and my needs while also understanding that people are complicated, selfish, pretty creatures and you don't always get what you give.\n\nI say move on, OP. You don't need the stress and the doubts from some guy who doesn't care enough to communicate, rather than act like a spoiled baby. It's total BS he says you should reach out to him. No. No way. That's not gonna fall on just you. He's gotta meet you halfway and not just absorb the OOC focus and expect you to cater to him. I have a partner who does have moments where he can't write or he has lots of self-doubt. But you know what? He still pushes himself to log on, say hello in the OOC and let me know he's alive, kicking and trying to sort himself out. I'm happy to wait and am as supportive as I can be without it draining my own mental health. Boundaries are important and taking care of yourself matters more than RPing.\n\nDon't feel bad about this OP, you didn't lose out on a good person and you'll find someone who you better click with!\n\nThis isn't your fault, OP. His MH is not your monster to slay. If he wants to be a good partner, he'll work on himself and hold himself accountable and talk to a counselor, get on meds, find ways to cope. Do not light yourself on fire to keep this baby warm. Sending love your way, OP!",

Either way, having mental or physical (or both) health issues of any nature, or any other IRL crisis, isn't an excuse to be shitty to someone or for him to flip his shit on you or anyone else. \n\n&gt;Apparently I should have been checking up on him... Why would I do that?\n\nReally not your responsibility. \n\nThis person sounds like they're not worth your time or energy tbh. There are plenty of other RPers out there, I'm sure you can find someone more respectful and rewarding to interact with.",
