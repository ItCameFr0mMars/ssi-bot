            "body": "The first bit advice I'd give to you is pretty clear cut: be prepared to never truly be satisfied with your work. Every writer who truly enjoys writing, that wants to improve suffers from harsh self-reflection. You will most likely always assume you can do better, that you will tear your words apart and envy that of another. As bothersome as it is, it's a sign of a *good* writer. To be content is indicates you feel you have reached your peak.\n\nI have done writing for 10+ years and still feel a modest insecurity, even though I type relatively fast and can give a plethora of words, sentences, and paragraphs of confident detail. I still feel intimidated even with people that take far more time then myself and post less; it is our desire to impress and to awe, and most importantly to make our partner's time worth it.\n\nYou need to remember this is a hobby, one that should inherently inspire you to relax and to be creative. It is the same desire of your partner(s) as well. Some of my favored partners have taken ages for small posts and I have had to be in the shoes of B and C ( your example ) and explain despite their disdain and anxiety that I truly enjoyed their work.\n\nAssuming things is dangerous, it's a path of paranoia that gives very little benefit. If someone is replying to you consistently, assume they are interested until they blatantly tell you they aren't ( or vanish as this hobby includes ). Confidence of any caliber comes with practice, exposure, and certain degrees of acceptance. \n\nI know you wrote you have begun reading and you've got considerable time under your belt, but have you attempted seeking consistent critique? Letting these people you envy help you refine posts and *see* their method? Books are good for improving writing but I feel the way RP is done it will only help with options but not so much structure.\n\nAnd also, RP and ERP I'd argue are two entirely different games despite sharing similar objectives. Unless you're reading straight smut novels ( which range from trashy to tasteful ) other literature will only help so much in that regard.",

            "body": "I totally understand how you feel since I have experienced insecurity many times, and I still have setbacks. \n\nI have being RPing for two years I think, and I feel I am still at the same point, despite reading books, articles and study English vocabulary (English is not my first language) while the people I have been rping with write novels out of nowhere about topics I am totally ignorant about. It even happened that I refused to reply or send my characters away because I knew I had nothing to do with their conversations and was intimidated by their replies and feared that I wasn't interesting to roleplay with. \n\nI have witnessed people changing writing style whenever someone had written a text wall, and I tried to do that too, and honestly I *hated* it, because I felt forced to write a textwall when it wasn't needed but mostly when I didn't want to. Only because I tried to show them then I can write more. \n\nSo the advice I am going to give you is that you shouldn't be forced to write long paragraphs when you don't want to and write how you most feel comfortable with. Remember it is a hobby where the purpose is to relax and have fun. It is not a job where you have to please people with your replies in my opinion. \n\nI have realised that I don't upset anyone if my replies are shorter than theirs. As long as you can work out with that reply, it is fine to write shorter ones too in my opinion. \n\nIf you are afraid that your partners don't like your replies, try to ask them for some advice. I don't know how long you have rpied with them, but perhaps they felt or even still feel insecure too despite their long paragraphs, and they can help you out. I am sure they will understand. \n\nI am not that great at giving advice, so I really hope this has helped you out a bit. I know how hard it can be, but try not to worry too much about it. I am sure that with practice you will be able to write long paragraphs without even noticing. \n\nLike I said, I hope this has helped out. Have a good day! :D",

            "body": "&gt;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\n\n\\- Ira Glass.",

            "body": "I would echo what others have said here: read more, ask for advice/feedback, maybe even try out some different styles. \n\nIn terms of read more, there are sooooo many authors out there, all with a wide range of styles. Maybe nothing's quite sticking with you because you haven't found one you really vibe with? If you're more accustomed to writing shorter, more impactful sentences and struggle with \"fluffing it up\" to match your partners' length, then maybe you're just not that flowery of a writer. That's fine. You don't have to be. I get annoyed by this trend among RPers to feel like longer posts = \"better\" posts. Length is not necessarily an indicator of quality. \n\nOne thing you might find is that the style of writing may change depending on the genre. So if you prefer less flowery language, maybe try some novels in the thriller/action genre. The prose tends to be more straightforward and action-focused. Romance novels, on the other hand, tend to be more immersive, lots of adjectives and ambiance, more focus on internal thoughts/feelings. These are over-generalizations, of course, and you'll find exceptions in any field, but try dipping into some different genres of books to see if something strikes your fancy. Amazon has this great 'Look Inside' feature so you can read the first few pages of any book for free. Just go through, say, the top few bestsellers in any genre and see if anything jumps out at you.\n\nAnd yeah, you can also try asking advice from RPers whose styles you admire. Just tell them you're looking to improve yours and if they have any advice for you, you'd really appreciate it.\n\nYou may also want to experiment with POV and tense. I know the trend in RP is largely geared toward third person, past tense. But nowadays with novels, I've seen more and more written in present tense. Back when I first started RPing (many, many moons ago!) this was the trend -- writing in present tense lent a feeling of immediacy that I enjoyed. There are also folks who prefer first person over third, and that, too, can feel immersive, where you really get into that character's head. One thing I like to do in my RP is include letters or journal entries where possible, so it gives me an excuse to write in first person as that character. Great way to get into their headspace!\n\nPoint is, don't be afraid to play around and experiment. You only learn by doing, really! Good luck.",

I can expand on my thoughts a bit.\n\nI do, constantly, ask the people that I RP with if there's anything wrong with my writing, or if they see anything that I could improve or change. And this is where part of the issue lies. Everyone tells me that my writing is \"fine\" or that my writing is \"good\". But these aren't words you use to describe something that you really enjoy reading. These are, simply, words that you use to describe something that's adequate, something that you're simply using to pass the time. **I don't think people are being honest when they tell me that they can't see anything wrong with my writing.** \n\nThey don't have any criticisms to offer. But I **know** my writing is not fine. And I can't improve it without knowing what's wrong. **Everyone tells me they think I'm a \"good writer\", but I know that's far from the truth,** and the only reason why they're not telling me is because they don't have anything better to fill their time with.\n\nThis is what I, honestly, believe. I'm very scatterbrained, and the quality of my writing ebbs and flows. I have a friend that's been writing for 10+ years, coincidentally the same person who introduced me to RP. And every time I send my writing to her, she goes line by line and picks apart the errors, and tells me that it's \"painful to read\". I wish more people would do this. If everyone was that brutally honest, I wouldn't have these insecurities, because I'd know exactly where I stand as a writer. \n\nInstead, I'm left wondering if everyone is lying or not. And, because I'm on edge and I don't truly know if I'm performing well or not, I can't relax, at least not around people who are better writers than I am.",
