By saying \"what's the big deal?\" it's the equivalent of saying \"lol, it's fine to ghost whenever you want\". \n\nYes, this is a hobby. Yes, we all have rl issues and things that pop up. Yes, no one owes anyone an excuse, but it's honestly not difficult to pop in and send your partner(s) a brief message that you're either busy, just don't have muse for the roleplay, or you want to drop the roleplay. You don't need to send them some long beautifully thought out message or anything, but letting them know is a common courtesy to show that you respect them as a person and enjoyed whatever time you spent with them, even if it's coming to an end.\n\nI've come to accept ghosting as the norm nowadays, however, that doesn't mean I can agree here with the \"who cares?\" bit, because it gets mentally exhausting when you think you've found someone, only for them to vanish after getting something started. It does drain our muse and creativity when 90% of the people ghost because they think it's okay to do and its seen as the \"norm\". I personally don't like putting effort and time into something for roleplay that won't ever see a reply and will be left hanging. The only time I approve of ghosting someone is when they're toxic and/or causing you mental stress, in which is perfectly understandable and a reasonable excuse for doing it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally understand where you're coming from here. You're right in saying we shouldn't let these people get under our skin and kill our muse, but that's a lot easier said than done when it's something you've poured time and effort into.\n\nHopefully, I don't come off as rude here (I apologize if I do).

I also try not to take it personally when it does happen, cuz chances are it has far more to do with what's going on in their lives than anything about me. The roleplay is one small slice of what's going on for them -- they've got lives, jobs, relationships, etc outside of that, so if they suddenly don't have the energy/creativity for it anymore, then it's more likely due to some external force than 'oh, you just suck so much as a person I can't RP with you anymore.' \n\nI used to get way more invested and upset about the whole ghosting thing, but once I got into a serious creative lull myself and just didn't have the energy to put toward roleplay, I could understand the ghosting thing a lot better. \n\nOne analogy I like to use is that roleplay is like planting seeds. *Most* of them won't sprout -- when you go through the rigmarole of finding a partner, you have to make sure your writing styles mesh well, your brainstorming sessions are fruitful and inspiring, your OOC personalities jive, and hope that no external forces interrupt (new job situations, illness, etc). With so many factors involved, it's no wonder most partnerships don't last long. Just like growing veggies from seeds is really tough! So just move on, plant more seeds, and see what sprouts!",

I do not consider people who are inactive all the way around to be ghosts, I consider them the be 'placeholders'. I'll explain why in a bit.\n\nSome people have anxiety and will internalize the act of ghosting as something they did wrong. For others, it's a plot idea they've been trying to get off the ground for ages and it can be disheartening to find a partner who seemed interesting, but suddenly decides to ditch. \n\nThere's a lot of reasons people are upset over ghosting.\n\nMe, personally? I think it's a sign of someone immature, even if they're in their thirties. If someone talks about how they habitually ditch people, I mentally mark them as someone not to write with. I'm not interested in putting forth the effort for someone who likely won't stick around.\n\nIn the same vein, you can't assume that the person who placeholds has ditched. In many instances, there's something that happened in real life. I had a friend who placeholded for close to a year due to their life turning into an absolute mess, which included health problems. They've since returned and while we don't write, I'm just happy they're okay.\n\nI always tell people when I lose interest in a role play, and the number of times I've been thanked is both amazing and sad.",

You don't need to send them some long beautifully thought out message or anything, but letting them know is a common courtesy to show that you respect them as a person and enjoyed whatever time you spent with them, even if it's coming to an end.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou are absolutely right in what you're saying and in an ideal world that would be the appropriate thing to do. In fact, it should be that way. There's no doubt about it and it's a shame that we\u00a0 (( people like myself )) have adapted the attitude to just say fuck it and leave without saying anything.\u00a0\n\nThat we've become accustomed to our partner(s) leaving without as much as a heads up. To the point it's become the \"norm\" and not only has it become the norm, but to also expect it as well as accept it for what it is in this hobby.\n\nHowever, real life is more complicated and morally fucked up than that. I used to let my partner(s) know that I lost the inspiration to roleplay, I needed a break or we just weren't compatible but sometimes it's better to just walk away without saying anything than to potentially get bombarded with spam, verbal abuse, guilt trips and the whole shebang.\u00a0\n\nI had to adapt the attitude of shrugging it off, letting it go and moving on to roleplay with someone else because if I allowed myself to become upset and take it personally then it would only make it worse for me. It can be very emotionally draining and taxing to ruminate why they didn't do or say X/ Y or Z so that's why I embraced this part of the hobby because it happens.\u00a0\n\nRealistically speaking it shouldn't happen but it does. So that's why I accept it because it's one of those things that does happen and it's out of my control. So I have two choices. Either I let it get to me and I become depressed over it or I can say to myself: \"For whatever reason this didn't work out and that's ok. I'll give myself a break and then I'll come back to it when I'm ready and I'll roleplay with someone else.\"\u00a0\n\nIf I didn't do this I wouldn't be able to participate in this hobby. As much as I adore roleplaying nothing is more important than my mental health and well-being. So when I see people posting here about being ghosted and how upset and crushed they are over it I always ask myself why they let it get to them? Ya'know?",

            "body": "For me, it's just about respect. It's not just the person ghosting who has a life and stuff going on: both sides invest time and effort, so it's frustrating. As has been said here, I don't expect a long letter as to why things didn't pan out, even just a 'I'm no longer going to be continuing this roleplay' at least helps me to know where I stand with something so I know to go out and look for something else rather than wait for another reply that's never going to come; I like to have 7-10 active roleplays on the go, so one being inactive and not knowing means I'm not likely to pick another up as I don't want to over-commit. Equally, if I'm enjoying an RP, think I've been ghosted and then they come back, it puts me in a bind if I feel I have too many commitments. And these are commitments to me, because I also appreciate and respect the time and effort of my roleplay partners too as well as wanting to continuously develop my writing abilities.\n\nI don't take it personally and it would never singularly make me quit this hobby, but, as has been mentioned, I see it as immature and also cowardly. In saying that, a part of me is also sympathetic to the side where it could be a symptom of someone's anxiety of informing a partner, but that's the thing: if it's not communicated, I won't know either way and I'm just going to think the worst of someone for it. \n\nI also don't think it's right just to accept negative behaviour and adopt it because 'that's the done thing' in any life context, this included. At the end of the day, why would you want to make someone feel like that? Even if it's something like you not clicking with someone's writing or not liking their ideas, you don't have to express that specifically if you think it will hurt them. The roleplays I've ended from my side have only been met with polite responses, and if people sling abuse for it then that's on them. Anyone who has communicated with me they need time off, I would 100% be willing to roleplay with again--I have a partner who has been gone almost a year and counting, and that's fine. But I would never RP again with someone who has ghosted and already wasted my time once.\n\nSo I think you have hit the nail on the head that it is indeed heartening, but I'm definitely someone with a hectic schedule most of the time, so when I do invest myself in something, I do like to know that it's not going to be time squandered and therefore find it much harder to brush off such irritation. Especially when it's on Discord and servers are deleted before I can even salvage anything. But that's all just me!",
