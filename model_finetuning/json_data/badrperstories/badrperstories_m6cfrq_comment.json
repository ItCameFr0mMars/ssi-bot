They're an incredibly useful tool so you keep your details strait and consistent throughout writing and don't contradict yourself.\n\nThe reason you don't see these profiles when reading a story is because it's a reference for the author and the author only.  When you're roleplaying there are two authors, and you should know at least a little about the character you're playing with.\n\nYou say I don't know need to know about your character's hobbies.  If our two characters know each other mine SHOULD know a little about yours.  If I know your character likes watching football it can help build or start a conversation.  My character wouldn't know otherwise to ask if yours watched the game last night.\n\nEven in instances where the characters are total strangers, knowing about each other's character can help build your scene and setting.  If we're playing two strangers in a survival horror setting in like a spooky woods and OOCly I know your character is afraid of spiders then I might be able to set up an encounter with a giant spider.\n\nYou don't have to write a novel length profile, but you should have a few important bullet points for your partner to reference.  This is a writing hobby, you should be able to write a little.",

But in terms of a writerly tool, they can be very helpful, and I've always been pleased with mine whenever I was inspired to make one -- just to have a repository to put all the details about my character as I write them.

A GM requires a sheet in order to make sure a character fits the RP universe and check if is plausible.\nOf course, things like weight or favourite hobbies can be glossed over a little, but when it comes to powers and occasionally backstories I personally want to know as much as humanly possible in order not to have powergamers and Mary Sues slip by with superpowers no one can contrast and find out that the new character is a god who solves problems with the clap of their hands.\n\nBesides, as the other replies stated I find that perhaps have another bullet point in the sheet may help you build a more fleshed out character and do not forget certain details. A medium long sheet with the bare essentials are the best sheets to me.",

I play a lot of kinder characters so I have to know what they'd be up against and being able to read into other characters helps set up relations and such. I've been in plenty of freeform roleplays where there was no character sheets and everyone just tried to one up each other constantly, play ridiculously overpowered characters, you name it. It's only fun for two seconds then it becomes mundane and meaningless. \nIf you want an organized roleplay and make sure people follow the SL, The Lore, etc, it's best to use sheets. Lest you get YAMAMOTO OF THE SEVEN SCARS, SON OF ODIN, WHO CAN TRAVERSE EVERY IMAGINABLE REALM AND KILL ALL. And that's not going to fit into your slice of life roleplay based in Los Angeles will it? I will agree though, I do not like those amino tier sheets, where they have slots like \"Meaning of name\" or \"Blood type\" like why do we need that? Too often do sheets like that take too long to fill out and people who come in my servers with all those details just ghost after their art project in the form of a sheet is approved.
