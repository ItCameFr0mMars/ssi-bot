It's not as if you're asking for a ban or he's done anything wrong, but it would be good to have an admin up to date in case anything turns sour and he attempts to twist the narrative.\n\nBring up how his desire to be everywhere and fix everything is making it hard to have character growth and arcs (especially valid if you have others to back up the issue) because he's insta-fixing things or trying to place himself where he isn't wanted or needed, which is like and equal but opposite issue to instant killing. There's always a chance to retcon or make new issues for characters to counter the ones he already fixed, but you'd like someone, yourself or admin, to ask him to chill out and maybe pm or discuss \"fixes\" with people or storylines before just waltzing in.\n\nIt's a small annoyance, there's nothing to get worked up over, you just worry about styles not meshing inna group setting and don't want the group to become tense because of this, nor do you want to stop rping in it because you aren't enjoying yourself due to him.\n\nSimple, professional.\n\nIf he turns into a baby afterwards though, then that says a lot about his personality and maybe he shouldn't be in the group.",
