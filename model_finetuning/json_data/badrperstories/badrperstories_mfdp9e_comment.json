            "body": "Tl;dr : It's a gamble trying to find good partners on discord servers since there is always another potential partner to try out. People often want something new and exciting rather than what they know, especially when infinite options are lined up just a click away. Taking a slower pace trying to find someone might be just what you need, even if it means taking a breather from Roleplaying. \n\nThis really could just be a me thing, especially since most of my best experiences have been with one on one RP's, but I find that jumbling too many RP's at once causes the joy to dwindle for each one over time. It's so very easy to get caught up in the fantastic thrill that comes from finding new partners that seem promising, often to the point where you take on too many at once. The important thing to note about this is that not only can it happen to you, but it can just as easily happen to others. \n\nYou may be perfectly able to balance your time spent replying to one partner after the next, but not everyone has the time or ability to do that. When their next \"fling\" of a partner comes along, it's not too uncommon to get left behind, no matter how great of a job you've done. Sometimes people just end up wanting something new and fresh, other times they just get tired and move on. When you find like minded people who use a variety of servers, or at least those who seem like minded, it's sadly also safe to assume they're probably in several other servers. There's always the lingering threat of someone else, for lack of a better word, *stealing* your partner. \n\nAgain, this is largely based off my own personal experiences, so do take it all with a grain of salt, but I've never had a good long term experience with someone I've met on a discord server. They do usually end to have a very rushed mentality of \"Now, now, now!\" for their Rps, and if you're just a little lacking in whatever they're after, they just jump ship and move onto the next available person. With servers, especially larger ones, there's an almost never ending supply of potential candidates that people are looking for. Even if you host your own server, there's a fair chance that those who join are already on the prowl in other servers. \n\nI've had an awful time finding a good long-term RP partner, and the few times I've found someone that I ended up RP'ing with for several years was always by chance. Normally I find that the best people to RP with come from those who aren't constantly on the prowl to RP, but are open to one if the chance arises. The type who tend to be less hasty to jump into a new RP are often the ones that stick around since they're doing it less to just kill the time and more out of a raw passion for the art. This is also, of course, not always the case, but it's been the vast majority of my experiences across different sites. \n\nIt's really hard to find people who share similar interests when it comes to Roleplaying, and harder still to find people who can match whatever level you're at or looking for when it comes to literary skill. If you're even slightly picky, it gets a hell of a lot harder. I don't think it's worth dropping standards just to find someone to fill that void left by others though, as if can mean losing a bit of what makes *you* so special in your own way. \n\nSorry if this all seemed a bit jumbled, but to finally conclude all this...just keep at it. Plain and simple. Sometimes taking a step back from something is necessary to fully realize what you actually want. Maybe you do need multiple RP partners at a time to feel fully satisfied, or perhaps you just need that *one* really good partner that never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat with each reply. Finding a good RP partner isn't all too dissimilar from finding yourself a great friend, even if the ideals held can be fundamentally different. There has to be an inherent respect for one another, a mutual understanding that disagreements in direction may happen (and that you shouldn't just up and leave at the first sign of trouble), and that real life events can sometimes pull you away for days on end. Maybe you'll find that exact person on a discord server, especially if you find someone who doesn't lie about truly wanting to setup some in depth lore. Maybe you'll realize that it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to use that time you've got from a lack of roleplaying partners to write a book! If you can't always rely on others to light that spark in your heart, perhaps it's time to get a matchbook yourself. \n\nGood luck finding the passion again, stranger.",
