Everyone responded exactly as would be expected except for his Buddy. It was a location where guards were present, so staff was summoned to NPC them and carry out the jailing of Dude. Dude went through to edit every single one of his posts to rewrite the scene as Dude was just *licking* his knife. Meanwhile, Buddy was trying to call everyone out for overreacting. Then they tried to stir up OOC drama related to the event and submitted complaints against the staff and PCs involved. They didn't have much luck with any of it. Buddy ended up extra sour when he faced penalties for defending a criminal.",
