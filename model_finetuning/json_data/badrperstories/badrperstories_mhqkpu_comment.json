I talk to my RP partners a lot too but that doesn't mean I'm in love with them.  \n\n\nI think you need to re-evaluate whether this is the right hobby for you if someone enforcing a boundary makes you so upset you chase them down on other channels after they've made it clear they no longer wish to communicate.",

            "body": "It's always tough to lose a friend, so I'm sorry you're going through that. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this but move on and take this as an opportunity to learn and better yourself. First, I think it's important to try and beat yourself up less. Guilt and remorse can be motivators for change but if you're stuck on calling yourself an idiot, moron, etc. that is not productive or constructive. You will be stuck wallowing in self-pity that does not help you.\n\nRecognize and accept that you made mistakes. Reflect on your actions and feelings to understand why you did those things. And think about what you can do to prevent yourself from repeating them in the future. You can't control what other people do or what life throws at you, but you can control your actions and reactions. If how you act when you're angry, hurt, betrayed, etc. \"always happens\", it is up to you to change that behaviour. This is important for all relationships and interactions you have, online and off.\n\nIt's a good start that you were able to communicate that you needed time and that you recognize that what you did was immature. Now you have to think about why you made these mistakes. If you were angry, fine. You can't stop the emotions that you feel, but you can express them in healthier ways. \n\nI think you also need to reflect on what your expectations were. I can't speak for her obviously but I bet she was just looking for a RP partner she could be on friendly terms with. I'd wager that a good number of female RPers are not looking for anything else unless they explicitly say so. Regardless, it seems like you wanted more and I think if you find yourself in this sort of scenario where you're catching feelings, you have to take a step back. Reframe the situation and assess where you're at. If she was looking for a real-life relationship, she'd be on a dating site.\n\nIt seems like a lot of women seem to encounter male RPers who don't respect boundaries. You may want to consider taking some time away from RPing for self-reflection and betterment before you try and find another partner.",

I wont lie in a messed up person so yeah I have my issues.we all have them but I in no way was reading into nothing. I am not a fool nor do I go out of my way to be one.
