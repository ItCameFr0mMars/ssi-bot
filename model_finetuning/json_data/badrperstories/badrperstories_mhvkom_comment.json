            "body": "Honestly i dont 100% agree. Roleplaying is strange, you can roleplay with one partner for 6 months, talk every day (although often not about very personal things, but small talk). \n\nNormally, a person you willingly talk to every day, would become a friend. More than strangers at least. In order to roleplay for a longer period of time there needs to be some kind of chemistry, respect towards the other person. During (long term) roleplay there are often more sensitive themes that come up that might be personal. (I think most of you guys get what I mean when I say that you put a part of your own experiences in roleplays). \n\nAnd then they ghost. Or send a message \"hey I am not feeling it anymore.\"\n\nAnd in that moment you have no right to ask them to continue or explain themselves. You have to accept them leaving. \n\nWhen a colleague you've been working with for several months, daily, that you have a decent bond with, you can tell them that you'll miss them. Doing so to a partner is not appropriate.\n\nIt's very unnatural. You get to know a person, you spend time with a person - in a positive way, personally roleplaying for me helps me relax and is an outlet for creativity. And then they go and that's it. \n\nThe worst part is that the entire roleplay community acts as if it is bad to feel sad when someone leaves. (Read that again: it's bad to feel upset when someone leaves that you've been spending time with for a longer period of time). I ain't a therapist, but feeling upset is perfectly normal in those situations. You are definitely allowed to miss them, maybe cry a little. \n\nThis whole take that we should be some kind of emotionless robots that don't give a fuck about being ghosted is just not the way human emotions work.",

I felt like we had become relatively involved with the roleplay and had a pretty good communication thing going on. I\u2019m distressed because I felt like I was suddenly left, but I have to keep reminding myself that I\u2019m not necessarily owed an explanation. It is hard, though, when you talk to someone every day for ~2 months and write a lot with them, and to have them suddenly vanish. I think it\u2019s normal to feel sad and bummed. But I\u2019d definitely not stalk them or harass them on other platforms. I left him a few messages and I\u2019m just going to allow them to reach back out if they so need to. I just hope they\u2019re okay!",

And you'd be happy to hear from them and pick things back up if they ever messaged you back, whenever that may be. But you're going to deal with your totally valid emotions of being bummed or sad as an adult and leave them be and hope for the best.\n\nPersonally, I've had partners go quiet for weeks or months for various reasons, and then when things settle back down for them, we pick our story back up or start a new one. And I'm currently in a quiet period with a couple partners who I write longer posts with because I'm in the process of selling my house and buying a new one. It's been a long and exhausting few weeks, and will be for a few more. I can handle shorter SOL posts right now with some amount of back and forth, but I don't have the creative capacity or mental bandwidth to write 6+ paragraphs at a time and drive the narrative in a non-SOL setting. Unfortunately, one of my partners was dealing with their own thing for a while, then as they were ready to come back, I started dealing with my stuff. But we check in with one another every few days or so, so I'm hopeful on that one :)",

Cry if you need to or journal about it (even just typing up a doc you don't save can be incredibly therapeutic).\n\nAnd I don't think anyone would feel like you're nagging or harassing them if you drop a short \"just checking in\" message after a couple of weeks. It's nice to know someone is thinking about you, even a relative stranger, when you're having a hard or busy time. Just make sure the message doesn't imply you're only sending it because you want to RP again or that you're expecting a response. You're just keeping the lines of communication open. And who knows, maybe by then you'll have found another partner who is working out just as well!",
