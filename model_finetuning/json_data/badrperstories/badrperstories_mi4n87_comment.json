            "body": "I feel like most people who ghost don't want to ***admit*** that they've done ghosted. It's kind of like admitting that you eat grapes out of the bag at the grocery store. Everyone does it but doesn't really want to get caught.   \n\n\nOne reason people don't want to admit it is because some people really take it *way* too personally when someone ghosts and will say a great big \"NOPE\" to someone who's even been *rumored* to ghost. It causes some people anxiety to find out that someone's been known for ghosting. Try admitting to all of your current/new RP partners that you've ghosted before and they'll most likely ghost you first. Why waste your time building an RP for someone who's gonna ghost? I've gotten somewhat good at finding some small red flags on who will/won't ghost but I still get surprised by who ghosts me and who doesn't. \n\nGhosting is gonna happen in RP and all of us have done it at *some* point. Heck, I've done it. Unless you just started RP like yesterday, you've ghosted before. I know I'm going to come off as a jackass here, but: if you can't handle it when someone ghosts you, RPing isn't for you. Sorry, not sorry. If you're going to get hung up on every. single. time. someone. ghosts. you. ever. then you're better off writing your own book or finding a new hobby.   \n\n\nGhosting happens for a reason. And I bet you everyone on this subreddit has ghosted before. Whether or not it was for \"good\" reasons.   \n\n\nAs a side note, I can't think of a better way to encapsulate the whole \"taking ghosting too personally\" than this:  Anyone else remember that debacle a while back where person A posted a vent about how person C spread a rumor about them ghosting and person B promptly blocked person A before they had a chance to explain themselves or ghost? Then person B proceeded to white knight themselves about believing said rumor because it caused them great mental anguish whenever *anyone* ghosted and tried to make person A out to be the big bad guy. And person A didn't put *any* doxxing info in their post, as per this subreddit's rules. So person B outed themselves just so they could go \"but they *could've* ghosted!! that's why I had to block them and stop talking to them without hearing their side of the story first\". I know that sounds confusing but that's the best way I can explain it lol. It was kinda a hot mess on all sides if you ask me.",

            "body": "It is also very interesting what people see as ghosting. Like, it is not ghosting if someone tells you that they want to leave and the roleplay isn't for them and immediately block you. They explained their reasoning. You know why they left. They are NOT obligated to find something else they can write with you or 'work it out'.\n\nAnother reason why it seems so prevalent is probably because 'negative' experiences stick more with people than positive ones. I myself am guilty of this. Let's say, for example, I post a roleplay search. I get five replies. One person doesn't answer anymore after my first message, I immediately forget about them. One person writes a couple of messages, we agree that for certain reasons it won't work out, they apologize and I tell them 'Good luck with your search'. I also forget about them. Three persons agree to start a roleplay with me. Cool. One roleplay is working out extremely well and we write for months, another one ends after some weeks because my partner is rather inactive and they tell me. The least one seems to go extremely well for some weeks, I am excited and maybe even feel a personal connection to the roleplayer because we chat so much ooc. One day, I come online, and their account is deleted. \n\nIn the end, only one of those experiences was really ghosting for me, but it will be the thing I think about the most, because it makes me question my perception in a way. Did the roleplay not go as well as I thought it would, are my ideas very stupid or do I come of as someone who can't handle the truth? I am being honest here, it took a little bit of time for me to be able to handle this better, and not get very sad lol\n\nAnd sometimes, people have bad luck. One time, I posted a roleplay ad on a different forum, and seven people messaged me. Out of them, four did not reply to my messages in the planning phase, and three ghosted me. Although my experience on other sites were largely positive, this really made me question whether I was doing something wrong and so on. Later, several people told me that ghosting is just a very common problem on that site. \n\nAnd they also said (and I had the same problem) that this made them see red flags everywhere, and they themselves did not care so much about replying to messages in the planning phase, because they always thought 'this won't go anywhere anyway, why put much effort into this?' One of these people also just deleted their account some day, no doubt that he ghosted some people doing that. It was like a vicious circle of ghosting in a way.",

            "body": "Personally, I think there's a bit of a grey area on what constitutes \"ghosting.\" Like, if I've just chatted a bit with someone, brainstormed some but nothing really took off and we never got around to the actual RP, then I don't consider that \"ghosting.\" It's just a seed that didn't sprout. And honestly, most of them don't. Plus, if that person never reaches out to me again, then I feel like it was kind of mutual. We chatted, the \"oomph\" wasn't quite there, and we moved on. No harm no foul.\n\nI feel like true \"ghosting\" is when you've brainstormed pretty extensively, perhaps even started roleplaying and gotten a story underway, and then all of a sudden they just drop off with no warning, and don't respond to messages, or inexplicably block you. With no explanation, that can be bewildering or hurtful, but I've taken the initiative to reach out a couple of times and just ask why. In one case it was apparently accidental because they thought they were just X-ing out of messages and not unfriending me. In the other case, they were having some anxiety/mental health issues and didn't want to \"burden\" me with them. So in neither case was it really malicious, and I don't think there's anything wrong with reaching out to ask. Just once, though. I mean, don't pester the person. Respect their boundaries. They don't respond, they don't respond, and that's your answer. \n\nBut I think sometimes folks are so afraid that someone has \"ghosted\" them that they never even think to reach out, when sometimes the explanation is totally reasonable, like someone getting sick or doing something by accident. Or life just got busy and it's not even about the roleplay. It's easy to assume, when all we have is that one tenuous link with this person, that their reasons must be specific and personal to us, when in reality they probably got overwhelmed with a whole host of other things and something had to give. \n\nAlso, honestly, ghosting isn't the worst thing. I think it's pretty common. Everyone wants that perfect long-term partner who matches all their needs and criteria and has the same tastes and is a skilled writer, but really, how easy is that to find? It's about like dating, and you're gonna have to go on a *lot* of bad or mediocre or just \"meh\" dates before you strike gold. But you keep doing it cuz it's so worth it when you do!\n\nSo, yeah, back to the OP, I've ghosted before (although I always try to offer some explanation when asked, but if no one ever asks, I assume it was mutual, and if we *did* get to the RP, then I do offer a heads up beforehand), and I've been ghosted on. It hurt the first couple times but now I just roll with it and try not to take it personally. It probably isn't.",

            "body": "Ghosting is absolutely prevalent. Plenty of people lie, especially when it comes to that one partner that was so strange/weird/concerning that trying to shut down things traditionally would only cause more harm then good. Everyone has their own reason why they do it and ironically I'd argue the the most staunch banner wavers of 'I HATE GHOSTERS' don't for a moment try to think or understand why they have been ghosted. It is a part of role-playing culture just as much as fandoms and smut; it's something you don't have to do or partake in but it absolutely will happen. As someone who's ghosted before and has been roleplaying for years, here's a bunch of reasons why.\n\n* They approach with the classic 'Do you want to RP?' without any context or suggestion or detail as an answer to an ad.\n* They are one of those role-players who make every scene/post only about themselves with little regard to the other person's character.\n* They do not contribute at all to world-building or plot creation despite asking them multiple times their thoughts, often summarized with 'sounds good'.\n* They are excessively creepy OOC.\n* They try to push their fetishes/cravings without consent where it doesn't belong.\n* They take several days to reply to an RP with only one line.\n* They treat their partner like a therapist despite knowing them for at most two days ( a rant about it being too cold is fine, unloading their entire life story without welcome is another thing ).\n* They type like a cat walking across a keyboard ( Dyslexic and English-second/third language writers are still better then lazy writers ).\n* They clearly show multiple times they are paying zero attention to the things you say.\n* They harass constantly for posts as if your life revolves around them.\n\nThese are personal and why I've done it. I also know for a fact a few people I've dealt with in the past do it for way less picky/bothersome reasons. \n\n* They're too busy with life and more important things come up that occupy their headspace.\n* They're so anxious and shy that completely removing themselves from the situation is their most comfortable.\n* They simply do not mesh with the partner and are afraid of informing them they wish to end it.\n\nTo the original point, most people have ghosted once or twice at the very least due to some reasons above or their very own. Sometimes it's annoyance, sometimes it's comfort-related, and sometimes it's because as a hobby it is not as important as the ongoing in their RL. For a long time now I've been ghost friendly: if you dip I won't harbor ill will or get angry. Sure there is a level of 'ah well damn', but that's it. I'm even the type that I welcome those who return to the fold of role-playing. I realize that when I'm ghosted it's either because we didn't mesh as writers, somehow I made them uncomfortable (  unfortunate but little I can do with them disappearing ), or it's something else entirely.\n\nPersonally, I feel that people need to stop complaining and accept it as is. Does it suck to be ghosted? Yes, but it's not the end of the world nor should it be treated like they just pissed on your ancestor's grave. The human reaction should be to move on, to continue one's life, and try again with someone new. If you expect to be ghosted, life in role-playing goes so much smoother. Every exercise in writing, even if ultimately leads to nothing, is never wasted.\n\nAs one final note and my own hot take\u2014people who complain horrendously and venomously about ghosting/get ghosted incredibly often don't realize it's their own fault for having so many red flags it looks like a full-scale Soviet Union invasion. On the other side of the coin one too needs to be careful and realize, simply enough, you can't and won't stop ghosting and you kind of need to accept it and move on or you'll drive yourself crazy.\n\nOne final, final note: Putting in your ad 'Please don't ghost/I hate ghosters' will do nothing but create red flags regarding why you're ghosted most of the time.",

Ghosting makes you question whether you did a good job or did something wrong, and especially if you're a rather unlucky rper, you don't get a lot of posts so you tend to invest a bit in what you have.

            "body": "It would be reasonable. While I have been ghosted and have ghosted, there are quite a few I've told of issues and a quite a few that have told me issues they have with me. I wish I could say most of them turned out good. I would rather in a perfect world people communicate and everything ends well, but the issue is this hobby is so vast with so many people, you get tired. You get tired of getting yelled at for an opinion and you get exhausted when it's the synergy that is the problem and they desperately try to correct it when it's just not a good 'fit'. You especially get worn out when people clearly show they don't give a damn about anything you've written, proposed, or put in your ad. \n\nIf people were more receptive to things they were doing wrong and it was as simple as something done wrong, the problem wouldn't be as vast as it is. The times I've hard ghosted and someone asked me what was wrong, that they genuinely cared why, I told them. I don't block people unless they're rude and obnoxious. \n\nOne can argue that it's better to be part of the solution then the problem, but unfortunately too many people don't care and too many people just want to write and not start a social revolution in the role-play community. I'm part of the latter, I just want to write so I adapted to taking ghosting with a grain of salt.\n\nIf someone genuinely feels they're a good role-player, that they communicate, that they give passion and enthusiasm, then nine times out of ten it's not anything wrong with the person ghosted as much as it is the ghoster which in itself could be mood, getting busy, having the memory of an Elephant, or just plan not interested anymore. \n\nEspecially in ERP, ghosting is SUPER prevalent given that a lot do it more for the 'Smut' then creating enticing erotic stories. Especially people that try to be shameless but have a lot of shame; it's often easier ( albeit rude yeah ) to remove themselves from the play and person. That's a talk that uh, usually doesn't give people answers that are ways to improve or communicate better given the circumstances. Especially when anonymity is very key given the fact so many people wiggle their eyebrows at it.",
