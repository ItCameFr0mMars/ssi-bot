Yeck.\n\nI'm not sure what historical situation this was or what counts for ahistorical characters, but you're right. If there weren't decent people in old times then we'd still have systemic slavery and no women's rights and child labor. Does it explain some people being garbage for reasons we'd shun today? Yes. I'm not against historically accurate mentalities, especially if they provide growth of character or plot drama at some point.\n\nBut it's not a reason to be absolutely garbage and justify dehumanizing someone or their character if the other party isn't game for it. Roll back to the stone age if you want that, for fucks sake.\n\nSorry you had to deal with that, OP. History is cool enough on it's own without the non-con, racism and other shit mixed in.",

There's a big difference there.\n\nAnd while a master might slap a slave for messing up, I'm pretty sure they had things about slave etiquette?? Don't quote me there, it's been a while since I researched Rome for any reason, but I'm fairly certain there were some laws because slaves could be expensive so harming one excessively was a no-go? I'll check back with that.\n\nEither way, there's just as many reasons not to beat a slave so yeah I'd think that's pretty ahistorical?\n\nIf they're looking for full tilt BDSM non-con with a historical setting then they should make that in their own ad.
