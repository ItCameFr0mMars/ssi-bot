And, personally, I don't consider that \"ghosting\" so much as just part of that initial exploratory phase where you want to see how well you vibe with someone. You exchange a few messages, maybe chat on Discord or via e-mail, and the \"oomph\" or chemistry isn't there. It's an uphill slog to hammer out a plot or characters. Their responses are lackluster, offering just yes or no responses to questions, or they simply say yes to anything you suggest and there's no sense that you're \"in it together.\" \n\nMaybe they just want to appease you so you'll RP with them? But I want to know they're excited about a plotline or characters, and willing to help drive it forward. If I'm gonna be steering this ship by myself, I might as well just *write* by myself. The beauty of collaborative storytelling is the collaboration factor, so I want to find a partner I vibe well with, where we can bounce ideas back and forth, get excited about the possibilities, roll with the curveballs the writing sometimes throws at you, and truly craft a story together. If I don't feel that potential chemistry off the bat, then chances are it's not there, and the storyline will eventually founder and go nowhere. It's sometimes an elusive thing, but well worth waiting for!",

This is why I avoid people who when I try to brainstorm, the only thing they ever say is: \"yeah\", \"sounds good\", or any other variation of yes without offering any kind of opinion of their own at all at any point. This is supposed to be a team project, not just me doing everything (even when I act like a GM, I still like to brainstorm about future plot(s) with my partner). Because if that chemistry isn't there, the RP is gonna be really dull. My heart isn't going to break just because you don't think cowboy alien squirrels aren't cool. Maybe I'll like your idea of pirate alien squirrels with bionic arms better! \n\nAnd usually from my experience those yes-people only want 1 thing out of an RP but that's a whole other discussion.",

And do I want to *keep* reading this, post after post, endlessly? Sometimes, sadly, no). So, yeah, usually there's some other factor at work, but I will sometimes get that giddy \"new RP\" feeling before it's truly warranted.\n\nIn a similar vein, sometimes I'll get all excited about a new storyline idea and post an ad for it, but by the time I've waded through the replies and responses, my enthusiasm will have waned (mostly because none of them really pan out) and by then I'm just like, enh, screw it.\n\nIn both cases, I'm excited about the *possibility* of the RP before I ever get to the RP itself.",

            "body": "Or, the person is just terrible.\n\nA few weeks ago, the topic of ghosting came up on a site I'm on. A lot of the reasons were valid, and then there were the red flags. A few people said they'd ghost if the person didn't post daily. One person was *bragging* about how often they ghost people.  They mentioned how they'd pick up multiple partners each week and end up ghosting them because of \\[insert petty reasons here\\]. Seriously, one of the reasons was because the person couldn't post multiple times a day everyday, but in the same breath they gushed over the RP.\n\nI've honestly stopped asking for writing samples. I've had too many times where I've asked for one, gotten something *fantastic*, and then got what amounted to something entirely different that wasn't of the same quality. I'm meaning things like one or two sentences with metagaming opposite of my behemoth of an intro.\n\nI will forever maintain that ghosting is incredibly immature in a large amount of cases (harassment, rudeness, creepiness are all valid reasons). For a hobby that's based nearly entirely on writing with other people, there is an **incredible** inability to communicate.\n\nBy RP standards, I'm old. I started young and ran the whole gauntlet of the different IM services all the way to many defunct hosting services. This idea of ghosting at the slightest thing is relatively new, maybe in the past 5 or so years. While it's been absolutely a blast to watch the hobby evolve, I can't say that it's for the better.\n\nI don't ghost people. If I choose to end a RP, I let them know. Have I gotten negative responses? Of course. The neutral ones have always outweighed the negative and I'll always let someone know instead of up and vanishing. They've taken time out of their schedule to plot/attempt to write with me, and I owe them that much. All bets are off if they start trying to give me shit, though.\n\nThis is a hobby built on collaboration, working with someone else or multiple someone elses, the merging of ideas. All of this is based of that nasty C word that the RP community seems to be allergic to, say it with me now: *communication*. Talk with your writing partner, bring up concerns. In most cases, they'll be happy you brought it up. If they get hostile over it, well, they just showed their true colors and by all means, give them the boot at that point.\n\nMaybe I'm just an old ass relic from RPs of years past who refuses to adapt to new RP norms, but this is one stance that I'll *happily* refuse to budge on.\n\nClarification: I consider ghosting to be abruptly vanishing once a RP has begun. Typically by no long responding to posts/ignoring attempts at OOC communication, deleting account, leaving a server, or deleting the server. Doing this prior to starting a RP isn't ghosting, a bit rude, but not ghosting.\n\n*Footnote: This post was sponsored by coffee and four hours of sleep.*",
