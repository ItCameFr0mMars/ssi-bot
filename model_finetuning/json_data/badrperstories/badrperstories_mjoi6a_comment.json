That's a bit scummy to stop replying and just keep on ignoring confront until you nod at their requests and claim you have thoughts into matter. Tbh most of the times the RP I planned turns out to take an unexpected turn due to the actions of the other person/people and that's what fun about it. Well, again, unless the other people are going to crash the RP into the sand of stalling by solving problems instantly, in that case I can accept a sprinkle of godmodding that pushes another issue into play or give the villain a way out of trouble so it can be fought again (I am into adventure roleplay so I kind of desire my players/partner to feel the threat or adventure real and dangerous and not pass the whole week sitting idly in front of their house).",

His character was this mighty OP guy, able to kill a God, to win every confrontation, this absolute charmer whom nobody can resist, etc. While my character was actually in idle because ''he hasn't trained her enough yet''. \n\nThen in the new setting I created my OC as a true techie. She came up with a new invention and I kid you not, he wouldn't stop annoying me OOC that she would need his help to create said invention because ''she doesn't know how xyz works''. So to create her own invention, she had to rely on the help of his character. And after that he wanted to decide how her invention looks and behaves. I literally had to dumb down for him and his ego. Now that I write about these things with others and I'm getting feedback from a third party, I'm actually getting pretty upset about his behavior. I'm going to stop the RP with him for good.\n\nThank you &lt;3",

My chips are on your character tbh.\nI like underdogs and side characters who are a bit more weak than the usual MC. \n\nRely on another character is usually fun as it incentivates collaboration and sparks up quests to strengthen bonds between characters. I like doing things like that once in a while, and rely on someone more expert is not necessarily a bad thing as they could also give more ideas.\n\nHowever I fully respect whatever decision you are going to make. I would personally look for someone different. Unfortunately some people, even self called expert ones are able of being bad. \nI probably do bad rp stuff myself but I try to come here and listen to some advice that may mirror some of my bad behaviours in order to change them.",

Best containment techniques require immediate dismissal of contact (with or without an explanation given to him based on your own preference) and blocking of the specimen on all accounts. While these type don\u2019t tend to be too harmful, they often mimic a similar species, the Predatorus Assholicus. The Predatorus is far more dangerous than the Protagonistus but considering it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell the two specimens apart until it\u2019s far too late, it\u2019s much safer to treat all Assholicus as the Predatorus.",
