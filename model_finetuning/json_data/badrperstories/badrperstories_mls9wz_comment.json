Aww honey let\u2019s just bang and forget about it.\n\nMy character had an episode of aggression that caused his to leave for seven months until he heard my character became a father and decided to come back? Let\u2019s fuck and forget that ever happened.\n\nHis character was about to have life threatening brain surgery and a secondary character was bullying the fuck outta mine? Lemme tap that ass and make it all better.\n\nMy character got diagnosed with a debilitating disease that would eventually leave him in need of constant care plus worry that his child and lover would be forced to watch him deteriorate as time went by? Why don\u2019t we just let them have mind blowing passionate sex to forget about it?\n\nHe eventually ghosted me outta the blue but Damn did it take me a while to realise what he was doing wasn\u2019t really the most okay thing to do given he sorta just used my character as his stand in Jack off material whenever the actual need for solving the problem between the characters arose but he was a really good writer so I guess I was conflicted at the time as to whether or not it was a bad thing.",
