The moderator told me to \u201cgoogle it.\u201d And that was it. It felt very uncomfortable with how rude and short they were so I requested to be talked to by one of the other two mods if something else happened since this mod clearly had it out for me. Long story short, she banned me and then her mean girl mods defended the rude actions. 2 years without an issue and I got banned over that.

I hope this sorts things out, and we're sorry if we've made you feel unwelcome as it was not our intent, nor was any of this done with the intention of being anti-LGBTQ (as I am LGBTQ myself), and was instead done with the intent of having a clear line for people to follow rather than vague rules on smut vs not smut which allows for loopholes.

Like many things in queer culture, it can be taken into a bedroom or smut setting, but that's not always or strictly the case. People fetishize trans women, that doesn't invalidate the fact that they exist or that people may want to write trans women. People want to explore third gender scenario's or intersex, that doesn't mean it's strictly a fetish. I've met many afab trans masculine people that loved a/b/o because it gave them a genre to write someone with a similar biology to their own. I'm sorry, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea - but if it's not simply don't partake in it. It's really that simple. By banning it, it does feel quite personal and like an attack against genders outside of the binary and people's ability to explore them in a safe, fictional setting.",

After being ridiculed and spoke to with a condescending tone through their mod mail I just gave up. I have debilitating and sometimes crippling anxiety and it stirred up a lot of that. Like I said, I was already anxious and asking for help because I didn\u2019t want to ACCIDENTALLY break another rule (since I thought the only way to tag an already published post would be to delete and repost and deleting posts is against the rules. I didn\u2019t want to get banned.. how ironic.) and asked for help. \n\nIt\u2019s neither here nor there though. I spoke privately in Reddit chat with one of them and she said the behavior was fine. That\u2019s how they want that subreddit to be run, it\u2019s theirs and they can do it. Proof is in the pudding that they got together to downvote comments.\n\nI agree with you though, that it should\u2019ve been an opportunity to educate your staff on how to properly respond and be helpful. There\u2019s one particular mod that used to go around, before being a moderator, and harass people on every post. Then she got moderator. I suppose with a subreddit large enough you\u2019d rather have rude moderators that are active instead of helpful and friendly ones that are easy to approach if they aren\u2019t continuously inhaling and exhaling Reddit. \n\nIt\u2019s Wednesday though and we are halfway through this week! That\u2019s a nice thing. Friday is just a skip away and then another weekend will be upon us. Praise to the weekend and I hope you have a wonderful journey to the weekend before enjoying yourself all weekend WetWhiskers00! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
