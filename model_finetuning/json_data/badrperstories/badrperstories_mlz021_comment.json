            "body": "I'm assuming given the context of it being a WoW RP and what other little details that you and possibly her are in the desire of something long-term with development between characters. I'll admit a lot of my experience from MMORPG role-playing ( and it's culture ) is from second-hand tales, but I can give you a bit of thought on it. \n\nFirst is the 'perpetually single' thing. That's a clear red flag for a variety of reasons, the main one is that it begs the question: why are they and why was that necessary to state? Character wise ( I'm assuming it's strictly RP-wise ) this can allude to a strong incompatibility she has had possibly with most of her partners. Be that an issue of the partners themselves or her lack of satisfaction with them\u2014it's irrelevant why as much as it will tell you that there is some kind of hiccup that occurs in the process and your likely to deal with it... possibly a foreshadowing of now.\n\nRomance in itself is a journey, it is not the end ( I.E. coupled characters ). She may or may not be pursuing the journey but not desiring a continuance there after; she may like role-playing the chase but not so much the resolution. That said it'd make sense she would have multiple partners for the same desire BUT I'll for the sake of this assume they are just in reality seeking the 'perfect' match. She's probably trying to see, if desiring a committed character story, which one would fit the best. I'd arguably say this is understandable in my own opinion but others could differ with me on that.\n\nIt's common for people to explore multiple paths that lead to the same destination. Her definition of something being 'serious' could vastly differ between yours especially at what point something becomes serious. That's not even covering what 'serious' actually means in this context. Even role-playing with the other person in lieu of her telling you she wasn't doing much and about to retire\u2014either she does not view doing such a thing as 'rude' one can interpret it as so OR she is saying to you that the other person she is just humoring and isn't worth mentioning. I've heard tales and talked with people who have a habit of just role-playing with someone because they really want it despite lacking in their own enthusiasm; a routine and mundane task that is done simply to be done. \n\nAll this said, there is a lot you can't find answers to because you're not in her head. My advice to keep your sanity is to just treat it as she does. Enjoy the writing when it comes but don't overcommit yourself, don't be afraid to also pursue the same intent with others. We'd love partners to be dedicated and 100% onboard with our desires but that is rarely the case. Especially when writing is essentially harmless and each person develops their own thoughts and feelings towards it, discrepancy is bound to happen. If you absolutely need to discuss your thoughts then do so, but know it may create friction where friction may not already exist.\n\n**Nutshell:** Give what you get and adapt to what happens or outline your desires and expectations coherently and concisely\u2014departing if you don't match or continuing if you believe their understanding and agreement to be convincing.",

            "body": "She's perfectly entitled to rp with others. While she should be more honest about going offline, it it's likely an effort to not upset you by telling you she's going to rp with others.\n\nThe reason she offered the alt is likely because she doesn't feel your character is a match for the active one. Another reason, she already has someone she wants to pair with them.\n\nI'd personally just back off and start finding new rp partners. If she's serious about going with your character and the alt (and you're interested), then she should contact you. If she only messages you for attention when she's bored, tell her you're busy. No matter what it doesn't sound like you are having fun and a game is about enjoyment. Go have fun!",
