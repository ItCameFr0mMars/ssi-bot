You're aware that a lot of these things have to do with your mental illnesses, so while this is obvious to say, naturally my advice is to work on taking care of your mental health first. I know this is much easier said than done, but if your habits bother you and you'd like to change them, it's most effective to get to the root of the problem. And of course, that's best for your overall health and well-being (which matters way more than RPing). I recognize this makes assumptions about you, which I apologize for, but if your mental illnesses are interfering with your functioning (e.g., your full enjoyment of your hobbies) then perhaps there's some tweaking to your care that can be done.\n\nAside from that, I do think many of these things can be mitigated by a forthcoming ad and good communication, like you realize. I've seen many others that mention they have a mental illness and may poof now and then, which is fine. You can definitely say 'no anime face claims' as well. You also can specify that you prefer a literate partner who posts less than, say, 6 paragraphs or whatever. For your #6 point - it may feel like someone who fulfills your quality + length criteria is perfect and you want to hang onto it, but if they have kinks/plots/ideas you're not into, they're not so perfect right?\n\nIn my opinion, someone is only a \"bad\" RPer if they know their bad habits and don't want to change.",

It is not bad to be 'picky'. I always find it really cool when I read an ad and people state all their preferences and dislikes, because I can realistically tell if we would be a good match. \n\nIf you go longer periods of time without talking to someone, state in your search that your post frequency is not going to be daily and that sometimes, you don't have time to reply to ooc chats.
