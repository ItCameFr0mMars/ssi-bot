If they had 'broken their promise' immediately, that would be something different.

For me, this is something different from 'No ERP in our roleplay' because it affects all roleplay they can ever do.\n\nHe should have communicated it better. He kind of owed you an explanation, at least.\n\nBut writing multiple messages, stalking them online, 'confronting' about something that is basically not your business...I can understand why they decided not to bother with it any longer.

The main issue I had was, the character he had partnered with mine, and friend's character would outright flirt with each other ICly even in my presence. I honestly trusted that he, as a person wouldn't have his RP character cheat on mine with no prior conversation. Like I said, one day I logged on and bam the two are ERPing.\n\nI've RP'd on WoW where I was perfectly fine if the person I was RPing with had multiple characters/partners because that game is more alt friendly then the game I was playing at the time.",
