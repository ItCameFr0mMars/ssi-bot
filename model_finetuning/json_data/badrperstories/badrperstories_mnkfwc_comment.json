Their characters are almost always blatant Chadified Versions of themselves and they consistently fail roleplay. (Or just barge in, don't read rules, etc.) I wouldn't mind this if they weren't aggressive gun/weapon nuts to the point where they make everyone ooc uncomfortable, especially if they're throwing around violent \"jokes\" and whatnot. And this is outside of military sim roleplays, I CANNOT FATHOM how they act in them. But this post is giving me some ideas.",

I was kinda the techy person since I knew a little bit of what I was talking about, which became frustrating amidst the spam of incredibly OP body armor or mechs\n\nThe problem though solved itself somewhat inadvertently. Since those people just kept losing every fight, they either learned to actually rp or just left. Same thing happened in a sci fi server I became a mod of. We had certain high stakes events where characters could die, so the people that ran forward into machine guns got capped after we gave them fair warning",
