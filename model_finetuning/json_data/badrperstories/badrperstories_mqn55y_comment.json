There was a post I had commented on not too long ago about someone going so far to deal with a partner who was being incredibly abusive and I pointed as to why they still followed through if there were so many red flags. I immediately got downvoted because I was \"blaming\" the victim. I get confrontation can be hard, but letting people step all over you is SO much more unhealthy and the fact it's over a simple roleplay is not worth getting worked up over.\n\nEven as an experienced roleplayer, I still managed to realize some of communication skills are lacking based on what you've written. Thank you OP for putting so much effort in this! I hope people really take it to heart as it can encourage them to keep their standards and find healthy rp partners.",

Sometimes, there are a lot of tiny red flags that are more easy to ignore, but if you look back and list every one of them, you think 'wow, that really wasn't very clever of me.'\nI think that on one hand, it is good to have compassion for the person who found themselves in such a toxic situation, because it can be hard to notice all the red flags and it is even harder to leave before their partner gets really toxic. But on the other hand, it is necessary to explore why someone has trouble saying no, and why this person is having trouble to voice their own roleplay preferences. Because if people do not realize this for themselves, they will probably find themselves in situations like this time and time again.\nIt should not be used as a way to shift the blame for abusive roleplay situations away from the toxic roleplayer though.",

This post were I basically try to give advice started as a way for me to compile a lot of small bad roleplayer stories about a topic (for example about group roleplayers or new roleplayers) into one post while also trying to add a little more to it then just a vent.\n\nI just read so many stories on here recently about misunderstandings, people having trouble with communication, or people saying stuff that is obviously a rather negative outlook on roleplaying (for example those posts/comments which act like 'everyone will attack/hate you when you tell them that you have problem in a roleplay, so it is better to just ghost') that I thought it might be necessary to remind people that communication is actually healthy and not something that has to be avoided at all costs. I think especially in a sub for bad roleplayer, the perception can get a bit skeewed and newcomers might get the impression that basically everything is a red flag or that every interaction with their partner will end in a worst case scenario.",

For example, if their grammar and spelling is so bad that you can't even read it (which is one of the more objective ways of determining that their writing is...not that good), they will already know. \n\nA lot of the rest is just personal preference. Yes, there are definitely characters who are Mary Sues, characters who don't have a lot of personality, and so on...but if you don't want to continue the roleplay, why should you tell them how to 'fix' this? Most of the time, it is not appreciated, and this is just the characters they like to write, no matter what some stranger on the internet says.\n\nOne of the only differences for me would be if they are obviously new to roleplaying and really don't seem to understand that the are doing something that is frowned upon by most of the roleplaying community. But even then, no need to be super rude.",
