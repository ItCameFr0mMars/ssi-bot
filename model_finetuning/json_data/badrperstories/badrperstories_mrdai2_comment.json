Eventually they got the message, turned out they were just an oversharer about headcanons and story and I wasn\u2019t really, so they thought they were bridging the gap between us. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to be honest though, sometimes that fixes the problem with people who are passionate about their ocs.",

They're better suited to novel or fanfic writing where their precious character doesn't have to share the spotlight with anyone.

Their plot suggestions are typically centered around their character, with little to no progression for your character, and you're not able to stay interested when the character development and focus of the plot isn't split evenly. Add in a few examples of plots you'd like to see, that are more collaborative, so they have an idea of what you're looking for.",

Hence why I prefer just building something from scratch with my role play partner.\n\nBut when I get an idea and I start to write it down outside of a role play, outside and unrelated to any role play really, of course I write from my side mostly. At the point of writing the plot, the only character I know about is mine. How would they fit, how would they work, what they are, etc. At the end I\u2019m leaving open suggestions about the partner\u2019s potential character, to give them more room to pick one. Furthermore, the time setting a role play up after a dm, is focused entirely on tailoring the plot to specifically match their chosen or made character. \n\nThis is how I work at least. Tho I mostly write them for fun. Not saying there are not things I could do better, but I just like to keep them more open towards the other person, while half-cementing my role in the plot (can change upon more planning).",
