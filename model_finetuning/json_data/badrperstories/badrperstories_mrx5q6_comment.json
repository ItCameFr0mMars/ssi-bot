            "body": "What exactly are they saying to you, could you provide some examples of a situation? Because your interpretation that they are being passive aggressive could also be based in your anxiety issues, and these situations might help people on here understand if your partners are really toxic.\n\nFor example, I often thought that people who were more blunt than me were rude, and their comments had some hidden negative meaning, when in reality, there were just more upfront than me. A lot of people also simply don't realize when they act like a know-it-all, and don't mean it in a negative way towards their partner. Or they defend their character in a playful way (me and a roleplaying friend for example will always say stuff like 'Steve is just a poor baby' about clearly evil/wrong characters as a joke).\n\nIf they really are toxic, talking down to you, or being passive aggressive all the time, my advice would be to stop roleplaying with them, because for me, that would kill all the fun of roleplaying, even if they have good moments or the roleplay itself is okay. Nobody deserves to be treated this way. But this could also be based on communication issues, and we don't know a lot about these situations.",

            "body": "A lot of what I notice is everything starts out alright. I try to show interest in my partner\u2019s characters and keep conversations going. When it gets into topics in and out of rp. I start to see that sometimes it is possible people will find my character thinking differently than their own as a personal attack. So OOC they start to defend their characters actions and personality. When I have only made my character react to the scenario. Not me as the writer judging them. When I try to explain my character\u2019s opinions it seems to get dismissed, or ignored.\n\nOr at times in the post I will notice that it starts to come across as if I am being told I don\u2019t understand it vs it just being the character\u2019s general feelings on the matter. Its almost as if my partner is not writing as their character anymore. Instead writing in a manner that is \u2018telling\u2019 me as a person. They start to give a sense that they aren\u2019t writing in roleplay point of view. Yet if I try to ask about it or check in I feel as though I am getting brushed over.\n\nI do know my anxiety could be a factor. It is hard for me to be upfront about how I feel someone might be coming across to me. I have not always had issues with roleplaying but on some occasions I don\u2019t know how to handle these types of people. I do think discontinuing is probably the best action but have worried I am taking things the wrong way. Usually I don\u2019t have this issue with my closer rp friends, as I know of.\n\nUsually the roleplay is fine until one slight conflict arises and then the behavior repeated and goes away once it ends.",

Some people (especially when they have a special vision for the character in mind, or their character is a self insert) get easily annoyed when not everything goes their way.

No? Then I don't believe you do anything wrong.\nThere is no reason to let that get to your self esteem. Some people are simply always like that, and it gets worse when they 'connect' with you, because now they feel more the secure that you won't point out these issues or at least not end a roleplay because of them.\nIf this happens really often, and you therefore feel uncomfortable with the roleplay as a whole, I would say that even with the possibility of it being a misunderstanding, it is better to end the roleplay.",

            "body": "&gt; Lately it feels like once I connect to my partner is when they start acting up. They will compliment my art, tell me that I am a great rpyer, and that I am creative one minute. (I also of course compliment them profusely and assure them I am happy as well.) Then the next minute they go out of their way to talk down to me, or treat me like I know nothing. \n\nThis resonated with me, but probably not for the reason you'd expect. It may or may not apply to you, but food for thought: \n\nThis sometimes happens to me, and it's a result of constantly looking outward for validation. I feed off of positive feedback, unsolicited * negative feedback can hurt me, and it's the void and the ambiguous feedback that devastate me. Because I interpret those things in the worst possible way. If a player (I'm a DM) doesn't chat with me OOC for a while, I wonder what I did wrong. Why are they mad at me? When they complain about a ruling, it's not a simple complaint or disagreement, but \"surely\" they're saying that I'm too dumb to know what I'm doing. \n\nMy therapist refers to this as \"mind reading\", and it's something I'm working on. Disagreements happen, and it doesn't mean that one of us is a better or worse person. Silence happens, and sometimes it's just because life jumped in for a bit. If something is vague, I'll assume positive intent and ask the person, \"did you really mean xyz?\" and give them a chance to clarify and correct (or dig the hole deeper). This doesn't mean that I'll put up with abusive situations (I have done so in the past because, of course, if it's all my fault, it's *all* my fault, right? So I should be able to fix it?) But it does mean that being aware of my thinking habits can help me put things back into perspective and realize that it's not necessarily what it feels like to my insecure self.\n\nAnyway, some things to consider. \nIt might actually be you, but not in the way you think.\n\n\\* (when I ask for constructive criticism, it's fine)",
