            "body": "Honestly, a lot of this could be helped greatly by just bringing it up politely and talking about it.  But, if you are not ready or willing to do that, I think the best thing you can do is look at your vetting process.  Some of your complaints are genuinely bad rp on their part and some of it just seems like clashing styles.\n\nLike, I can tell just by reading this that we wouldn't be compatible at all and that's fine.  Doesn't make either of us bad rpers.  Just different.  Given that, I think if you were really specific about the types of posts you want, the pacing you want, and the heavy focus on story progression, you'd have better luck finding people.\n\nSome people find asking for writing samples helpful.  If you do go that way, ask them for a specific thing like \"Can you show me a couple old rp replies where you are responding to another person's post?\"  Otherwise, you usually get sent some solo piece.\n\nWhen setting up an rp, don't be afraid to ask the other person questions or to let them know some of the things that annoy you upfront.",

            "body": "Yes, it likely can. I don't deny that to some degree it's my fault for my lack of capability addressing problems I have with the roleplay or etc.    \n\n\nWhilst I do believe you are correct on the aspect of me needing to be more specific, I do believe I'm already really rather intense on what I'm looking for in terms of specificity.  It's mainly just that these things aren't the type of thing I can get unless I see extensive post history or back and forth. A few posts can be short, less descriptive, or in general just not very good in what I'm looking for.   \n\n\nTelling people that I can't enjoy their roleplay from what is only a single fraction of it is pretty hard for me to do, and feels rude.   \n\n\nOn the contrary, it's really  easy to go. \"We've been roleplaying for about five days, made 60+ posts, and not gotten anywhere past the stage where they have first initially met and hung out for the first time. Though that's fine! \" If it's really short posts I can understand that, but it feels really awkward to write 20 or so pages of content with someone to not have it move anywhere.  \n\n\nyour preference is up to you, I respect that.
