            "body": "\nIn my personal experience servers just plummet into the stalling void when there is some drama in OOC that makes people leave. \n\nOtherwise someone vital for the health of the server decides to quit; usually these people are the ones in charge of npcs or to move the plot forward stops narrating, or perhaps they have the lore in their mind.\nWe can speak forever about how much everyone should contribute to the plot however it is normal that some people will like to take a \"DM\" role more than others, and if only those are the ones that know what's going to happen next and then disappear, the whole RP is in a very though pickle.\n\nIt happened to me that two DMs decided to create two regions of roleplay in the group just to go idle for years. Those regions stayed there for ages to collect dust. People had intention to interact with those places, but they couldn't because there was no one to guide them when in there, and other DMs felt like it would be stealing (and a taxating work) to take up another region besides the one they were already mastering from default. We were all friends but suddenly they went out of touch, and I loved that place myself.\n\nThe only solution I found at that time was to animate the rest of the characters left by myself. People kept calling that place dying server, but at least two regions were sort of functioning and we moved the plot forward. It lasted for quite a while. Then [Wolf](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/l589zr/ooc_roleplay_with_a_twist_enemy_within_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) came in with ill intent and things crashed down because of course they do when someone likes to create petty drama and doesn't get kicked but instead elevated to admin for no reason.\n\nWhen a server is getting freezed and no one else in staff seems willing to do anything about it, the only thing you can do is start trying to have fun yourself if you manage to get someone else to join your party. Try to make some players and their characters join the fun by contacting them or make up some scenes between their and your characters. You may start something, and make the server partially return online.\nThat is the only advice I can give when times gets rough like this.",
