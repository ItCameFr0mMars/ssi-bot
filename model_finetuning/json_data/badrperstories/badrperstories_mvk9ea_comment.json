Admittedly, I exclusively write in groups on Discord and only venture into one-on-one play if it's someone I know and have already built trust with through one of those groups. Because of that, I haven't been ghosted in years, and I might well be out of touch with your particular issue.   \n\n\nThat said, if I was to guess, I'd think that if you're looking for 1v1 play on Reddit and then wanting to switch platforms to Discord, that might be part of your issue. It might be that a lot of people want to stay on the platform they're advertising through. I know r/Roleplay in specific is tailored to RP **on Reddit** and they've made no secret out of deleted ads for other platforms. IIRC it's also in their rules that they do that now.   \n\n\nIt might help you to join a hub server on Discord that has a place to post solo ads, because then the people are already on the platform and you don't need to spent time getting their usernames and tracking them down, most of those hubs also have a writing sample channel where people can show off their work - and then you can find people at your writing style much easier.",

I do so much better when I'm able to \"meet\" them IC in a group setting with random character interactions. These also tend to go more smoothly and be less ghosty. \n\nI strongly recommend joining roleplay hubs where you can talk to people in a \"public\" setting, then reach out to the ones you hit it off with to see about planning. Gets you through that icebreaker stage with less pressure, and removes the step of switching platforms (Reddit to Discord).",
