Definitely both parties need to be in agreement with what they are okay with writing/ reading. As long as both rpers are good with it, then there is no issue in writing even the most perverse fiction. The key word is fiction. Writing is a safe way to play out what would otherwise be dangerous fantasies.\n\nPersonally, I do not like writing anything smut related. It isn't something that I am comfortable with. Just because I am not comfortable with it though does not mean others feel the same way. As long as the players are of age, able to consent, and it all stays in the fictional world - then write away.",

            "body": "The only issue I have is w/ the \"excuse of fiction\" because almost any situation or fetish beyond *maybe* lite 50SOG style BDSM will be considered \"taboo\" for any reason. In the grand scheme of things, adultery (taboo kink/fetish) is less fucked up than murder (fucked up situation) but both are considered taboo even if not on the same level. I got told roleplaying DDLG was fucked up by someone who had a vore fetish... which I personally found more fucked up than mine.\n\nIf your partner is trying to *force* you into doing something by saying that it is \"just fiction\" then that is a red flag because they are not being respectful to your boundaries, and *it shouldn't matter* how much or how little something is morally wrong, taboo or fucked up. In my experience, a lot of people often find their boundaries being broken over tiny things because even if it makes them uncomfortable, it isn't a *bad* thing and it's something that is \"okay\" to roleplay so they compromise their own comfort and give in to their rp partner... and then it becomes a snowball effect where it was \"Well, I did this one little thing, I can do this other little thing\". What matters most is the consent of the individuals... if they both feel comfortable writing fucked up shit, then it is mostly a non-issue. \n\nThat said, I do agree with the rest of your points on making a good faith effort to verify the age of your partner and that partners can become abusive and roleplay can become an emotionally draining or dangerous hobby if left unchecked.",
