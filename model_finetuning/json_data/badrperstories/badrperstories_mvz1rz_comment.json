It might sound bad if I don't word it correctly but I'm hoping it doesn't.\n\nThat being said, there is a possibility that the \"bias for MxM and LGBT+ only\" romance might be a deterrent? Not so much in the mentality that the LGBT is bad or anything (I say this as a demisexual so it's not like I'm a cishet coming at this), but more that:\n\n1) a lot of rpers are female and...\n2) some people only play, or prefer to play, as their own gender because...\n3) romance (and smut) are very sought endeavors in some groups...\n4) with some people projecting onto characters even just a giant bit, even if it's as limited gender identity, for gratification purposes, which I'm sure everyone is guilty of at least once\n\nSo that all being accounted for, it feels like a wall to some people saying \"if you play a female don't expect fluff, and if you want fluff I'll only do gay pairings\" and if the person isn't into it or in the mood for that specific take, then they'll pass over it.\n\nI'm not saying it's bad or you need to change your preferences by any means, but it is something to consider from and outside perspective that the limits placed on a popular rp topic might be deterring people who aren't in the mood for those specific limits.\n\nHoping you find partners eventually though",
