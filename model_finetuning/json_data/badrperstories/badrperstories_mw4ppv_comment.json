I felt like he only did that because I asked him to make a minor change and maybe asking him that maybe him feel inadequate or something and that\u2019s why he started listing every single thing he felt was wrong with all my responses. Even though he said I didn\u2019t have to change anything and that we could just continue I just didn\u2019t feel it was worth continuing that plot after the way he acted. He\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m being a bully aren\u2019t I?\u201d so it felt like he somewhat recognized his own toxic behavior so I thought okay maybe I can give this another chance so I told him to come up with a plot this time and do a starter this time thinking maybe something would change, but his responses after that didn\u2019t show that he listened at all and that\u2019s when I concluded I was done. Then it felt like he was trying to guilt me and make me feel bad for just \u2018giving up\u2019. It just felt a bit manipulative to me and then saying take care, but then saying a bunch of things afterwards then asking me why I was still talking to him. Cause you\u2019re still talking to me and making a bunch of comments that\u2019s why.... (I thought this in my head). \n\nI really really need to start seriously listening to my gut feeling on this things.",
