I'm not going to make any assumptions on the why. Some people are able to handle a lot, and sometimes people bite off more than they can chew.

Some respond daily, some weekly, some once a month and I don't really care how long it takes them to reply because this is a hobby not a professional obligation. \n\nBut I keep a running To Do list for RP and every time I receive a reply I write it down in my to do list and when I have time I reply to my scenes in order of receipt, that way everyone gets equal attention and I don't prioritize any storylines over any others. It helps keep me organized and helps my lines stay afloat and I still am sometimes able to get multiple replies out to my writing partners who reply quickly if I am able to get caught up.",

I had plenty partners who'd always welcome me back with open arms fortunately. For me, the reason I took on so many RPs was because in the periods I did I was so inspired that what I had didn't feel like enough. I wanted to write more. So I'd take on more plots that seemed like fun. \n\nI've learned to pace myself these days though. I recognize the mistake I kept making in my eagerness.  Too much is never good.
