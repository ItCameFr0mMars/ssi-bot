            "body": "The thing is that self-inserts to me, just like power fantasy, or anything else can be done well or wrong. They are tropes, so they are inherently neutral in their core. However, the large amount of disastrous stories that went over the extremes of these tropes gave them a bad reputation that almost overthrown the definition of the trope itself, so it is difficult to avoid completely. Even I sometimes fall victim of this generalizations.\n\nFor instance power fantasy could be seen as the santification of a character that steamrolls their way to victory. This doesn't mean that having a balanced empowerment moment makes your story horrible just by having that trope in.\n\nHaving a powerful female lead doesn't inherently mean she's equiparable to that Mary Sue from that Trekkie's Tale where she singlehandedly solved every problem alone with no struggle whatsoever because she is perfect and has a shallow personality that everyone loves. This is a case where the term Mary Sue/Gary Stu apparently merged with the trope of having a powerful main character so much that people now seems willing to cancel it because they find it offensive. I do not want to express myself too much over the topic, however it  seems for me the textbook definition of generalising and misunderstanding a trope. Not every powerful lead is a Mary/Gary Sue when it fits only its partial definition and has redeeming qualities.\n\nAs for self inserts is obviously important to put a little of themselves in their characters, from hobbies to ideals, it is useful and nice to make them relatable to us and make them more realistic. Self-insert is a trope like any other, so unless it  is guilty of something it should be considered innocent.\n\nThink about tropes as a recipe ingredients. When the ingredients aren't balanced and one overwhelms the others, there is probably some going to be some issue that make the dish not as tasty as it could be.\nI hope this helps to clear some doubts!",

So they think about reasons why their writing partner acts like that, and the most common one is that their writing partner's character is a self-insert.\n\nOr stuff like: I know what you look like (exactly like your character), your character has exactly the same name, all the same hobbies, and so.

            "body": "In my opinion, the short answer is connotation, and the long answer is a little more complicated. \n\nAlmost everyone's written at least a bit of a self insert; and if you started young - like myself - the chances of that are much larger. When I started branching out with my characters, I quickly adopted the idea that self-inserts were bad. That they lacked introspective depth and creativity. I associated those writers with being young and un-seasoned. \n\nAs I've gotten older, I've realized they are just like every other character that can be written well or written poorly. That being said, there is a definite correlation between self-inserts and writers that are too close to their characters. I wont break down why that isn't an ideal characteristic in a partner, as we all know what that looks like. \n\nRegardless, because of this, self-inserts have become another one of the red flags we have trained ourselves (sometimes, subconsciously) to look for. This seems to be especially the case in writers who've been at this for a long time. They've done the self-insert thing. They're looking for different dynamics. In the never-ending shuffle to find writers that click with you, you find so very many that do not, and the more criteria you can identify that you have (personal preferences that can take away from the experience for you), the more successful you are. The better your chances are of not wasting your time, or the time of the writers around you. \n\nMy boil-down is similar to other commenters here. While I will be a bit wary if your screen name is the same as your character or if you describe them similarly to the way you describe yourself, I want you to bring me an interesting character. Bring me someone well-rounded, who has flaws and quirks, and their own personality. I don't need to know whether or not this is a projection of yourself. I just need you to be able to look at the character objectively.",

My current OC does share visual qualities of some of the characters of the past (Used to have a real obsession with giving everybody freckles lol although I don't have any) but personality-wise they're nothing like me or them. They actually have a personality lol. \n\nAnother thing that's difficult about writing characters though, is definitely making sure they don't have too many flaws and quirks.
