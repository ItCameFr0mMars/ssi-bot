Something like 'I am not in the mood at the moment to be 'friendly' can sound like you were putting on a facade the whole time, they are annoying and did something very wrong by just contacting you and so on. As if they did something wrong by wanting to write with you.\n\n It can make people wary of contacting you, and that is the last thing I personally would want in a roleplay. Thinking that every time I contact someone I might disturb them or annoy them is not a very pleasant feeling. Yes, it is not really a full blown argument, but it is a real reason not to feel comfortable with writing anymore.\n\nI understand that everyone has bad days, but the way you phrased it was rather...unfortunate, at least in my opinion.",

            "body": "Honestly, I feel like your phrasing was a bit off, like u/Nachtreiher. \"I'm not in the mood to be friendly\" can definitely come across as snappy or as though your previous interactions were disingenuous. In future, I think putting \"Sorry, having a rough time\" or even just \"sorry, can't reply today\" can work if you're having a bad day or are in a bad mood. I'll be honest, I'd probably find that response to be quite bitter and would be drained of desire to continue the RP, especially if the user and I were friendly before. I'm sorry this happened, but I do think your choice of wording definitely didn't portray you well and may have been a red flag.",
