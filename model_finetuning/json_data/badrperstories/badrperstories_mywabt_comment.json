I do one-off scenes as well and see nothing wrong in that. \n\nWhen I specifically seek out long-term, though... then the part where the relationship is established is where the fun lies for me. Having the characters meet. Get to know one another. Become more confident in the other's presence. Form a bond. I would love that to develop organically through the course of the long-term roleplay and watch the relationship blossom into what some of the partners want to be there from the very start of our play.",

But it was taking like 15 - 30 minutes for us to get each response written out... \n\nI absolutely understand the frustration of someone skipping all the \"foreplay\" of an event so to speak, but as equally frustrating is an RP where all the mundane details take *forever* to get through before the actual RP scenario starts.",
