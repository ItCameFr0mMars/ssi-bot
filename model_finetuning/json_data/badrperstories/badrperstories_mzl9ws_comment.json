            "body": "A lot of people are projecting their past experiences on their partner. For example, sometimes many of their partners are busy or ghost them at once, so they get frustrated and lash out, even though that particular partner that tells them 'Hey, I am busy at moment, so sorry' is not at fault that all the others are busy too.\n\nMany people also feel cheated easily, as if someone lied to them. So they might think of themselves as understanding, caring, and so on. But they easily suspect that the other person is not really busy, just lying, the roleplay was doomed from the start, ... and that gives them the justification to react in a cruel way, at least in their mind. They write into their profile 'your real life always comes first! I am very understanding.' but then suspect that you are lying about the real life reasons that keep you from roleplaying.\n\nThat is why they complain about it but also are part of the issue. When they have a problem, they know that it is 'serious' or taxing enough to leave roleplaying for a while, when their partner has a problem, they suspect they just don't really want to write.\n\nThere is also another group: people who want to be polite, think that they don't care if you disappear for a while, but when the roleplay is about to start they notice they have lost interest. But they already said that they are okay with waiting, and feel bad about telling their partner that they can't keep their promise, so they ghost to avoid the confrontation.",

We were both extremely happy we found each other. To keep it short, I just thought I found my new long term roleplay partner.\n\nAt first the responses were being thrown back and forth pretty quickly! Everything was going good! And then all of a sudden it has been taking her a day or two to reply. Which was okay at first but we have been stuck on the same scene for like six days now and it\u2019s a little frustrating. I feel like the story isn\u2019t progressing at all. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard for me to keep my interest on a story that has zero progression. Most of the time people sought out for other partners to fill up the time so when we get a different partner and create and story that has progression, we (or at least I) start losing even more interest in the other story. \n\nI think we should stop expecting partners to be engaged in a story that isn\u2019t moving at all! \n\nhope this helped you see the other perspective!",

But if it takes \"too long\" then they decide they're done. \n\n&gt;highschoolers and young adults. And both complain equally as much about all the above problems while simultaneously being apart of the problem.\n\nI find high schoolers to be so obnoxious in terms of how much free time they have for RP and how easily bored they get. There was one group I was part of many years ago that attracted a number of high schoolers and without fail they would complain about activity all the time. It seemed like they were looking for MMO-levels of activity and entertainment. Young adults can go either way - either they're unemployed and bored or busy with school.",
