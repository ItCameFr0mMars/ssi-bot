            "body": "Channels can be handy for organization if the system is intuitive enough, but I'll admit the number one reason I leave servers is because there's too many channels, or worse, too many Google docs scattered across all the channels. Shit's positively hellacious to navigate.  \n  \nNot all servers are created equal, though, and I've been in multiple servers where at least one of the problems you describe don't apply! But I totally get why you'd get a bad impression of the medium as a whole; most public servers out there are really great examples of Sturgeon's Law, to say the least. I think you might have better luck with private group servers\u2014a lot of RP advertisement hub servers will have group seeking/searching channels where people post about small group RPs they're starting or looking to start with other people, and generally within those you'll have more input on server structure and more organic onboarding/character creation processes.  \n  \nAlso, I don't have much experience with the modern RP scene outside of Discord, but for Discord-free alternatives you could check out RPNation, a forum that hosts user-created group roleplays, among other things, or one of the many advertisement forums for individual forum RPs out there; I'm not too familiar with the latter, though. (FYI, JCINK is just one of many hosting services people use for their forums. It took me a while to figure that one out, too.)",

            "body": "&gt;FYI, JCINK is just one of many hosting services people use for their forums.\n\nAhh, thanks for the clarification!  I think on some level I gathered that, but it's still overwhelming to be wading back into the thick of roleplay and to see how much has changed from what I've been accustomed to. Most of my recent forays (besides the Discord servers) were for one-on-ones played out via Google-docs.  Far easier to manage!\n\n&gt; I think you might have better luck with private group servers\n\nI think you might be right. I guess the trick is finding them/being invited? I actually much prefer smaller groups where there's a more solid storyline. It seems like most of the RP on the public servers is just the usual meet-and-greet kind, and I'm used to collaborating on an unfolding plot with a partner and nudging things along in one direction or other. The aimlessness of public RP is a bit mind-numbing.  I keep thinking surely there's some small group where the characters are all inter-connected in some way, and/or there's a plot/goal/objective they're undertaking, or some juicy intrigue/conflict to drive the story. Regrettably, that does not seem to be the norm. But I keep looking and hoping!",

It is possible to figure it out, but like you, I've also seen more than a few places that just kind of throw whatever, wherever with seemingly no organization. It usually makes sense to the others that have been there a while, but there's the ones who are new and they seldom get more help than a person condescendingly saying \"it's pretty obvious if you just look.\"   \n\n\nThere are some servers that have more organization. And some that are trying their best, which I always appreciate. But, the platform is certainly not for everyone.   \n\n\nIf you're looking for a forum, I'd really recommend Elliquiy. I always personally preferred the speed of a chat room, so Discord suits my personal needs and those of my storyline better; but Elliquiy has a phenomenal staff that genuinely cares about all their thousands of writers. It can be a great place for someone who needs more straight forward organization.",

And, like, general brainstorming and goofiness and such, but there are still things that bug me about it. Like the fact that you have to \"friend\" someone before you can chat with them. That seems so presumptuous! \n\nI also hate the character limit. My posts range all over the place in terms of length and I'm definitely a fan of \"less is more\" when the need calls, but sometimes you just gotta get wordy and it's irksome to have to paste in multiple snippets. \n\nAnd yeah, I've started copying &amp; pasting the scenes I do in Discord into GDocs, cuz, I dunno, I'm a hoarder that way. But it's all digital so it doesn't count, right?",

            "body": "As a Discord RPer, it seems to me like you've just had awful luck. So much of what you list is stuff that's easy for mods to fix.\n\n&gt;And the fact that the roleplay all just happens on channels, but sometimes more than one scene will be going on, so everyone has to keep @ -ing each other to know what segment goes where. Not to mention for a new person, you gotta wade through, like, *every scene that ever happened* in that channel to find the latest.\n\nSeems to me like the mods of these servers need to implement multiple channels for the more popular areas and maintain a strict one-scene-per-channel policy. That way, people can join or leave scenes whenever they want, but they can't just start new ones unrelated to what's already going on. I've seen the consternation that sort of thing can cause, and let me tell ya, only allowing one active scene in one channel at once is a godsend.\n\n&gt;Oh, plus there's the fact that if you just want to check out a server and see what it's like, first you gotta pass some sorta arbitrary test and submit a writing sample, verify your age, sign away your firstborn child (practically), all just to see if you like it well enough to go through the rigmarole of creating a character. So many hoops to jump through, when sometimes I like to get a feel for a place before dipping my toe in.\n\nOut of all the servers I've joined, I've only ever had one do this, but maybe I'm just lucky. All the other servers I've joined? You submit a character, get them approved, and off you go. The mods only intervene if what you're doing is patently awful (godmodding, metagaming and such).\n\n&gt;Not to sound too much like an old fogey (back in MY day!), but I came from a background in MUSHing, which I suppose were vaguely similar to a Discord server. Except that you could build a whole grid, with all sorts of \"rooms\" that players could wander through. The rooms would all have descriptions (and I can attest, having once volunteered to describe a whole forest, that it ain't easy coming up with endless ways to describe dark, sinister woods), and *characters* would have descriptions, and you could check out their profiles and get all the info you needed: full name, history, factions, etc. You could page people, which is like DMing, and you could even have message boards, to post, say, rumors about what was happening in-game, or ads, or whatever you wanted.\n\nSome servers have channels specifically for stuff like this. Lore, character profiles, etc. are all put in their own channels that only mods and GMs can post in, and that makes it easy to get an idea of who you're with, what's happening, etc. Sometimes they'll even have descriptions of areas in the channel descriptions next to the title. Not ideal (not easy to notice channel descriptions), but they're there.\n\nSorry if I sound like some sort of ad bot, but my personal experiences on Discord are all I have to relate to your experiences since I've never seriously RP'd anywhere else.",

The best ones I've been a part of have all had overarching plots allowing people to participate and help shape the story to their hearts' content - though with plenty of room for \"free RP,\" as it were, meaning the small little \"meet-and-greets\" and so on.\n\n&gt; That's the thing, though. I don't really *want* to create a character until I've had a chance to poke around, get a feel for the writing, the types of characters, the plotline, the overall vibe.

Never really had this experience either, but maybe that's just luck lol.\n\nThere are services like [Disboard](https://disboard.org/) out there that basically serve as search engines for Discord servers. In order to be listed on these services, the server typically has to have a bot that admins have to manually use commands on to get the bot to promote their server on these sites. What that means is that the mods of the top servers on sites like Disboard are at least somewhat passionate about their servers, else they wouldn't bother to command the bots to advertise said servers.\n\nI'd advise having a look around Disboard and whatever other server search engines you can find, joining a few of the servers that seem more appealing and having a look around on them.

How to put this: If someone just watched a movie or got into the series, and just wants to go swinging a sword with their best bud canon character, that's fine.  If you go to a Original Character only server and start blasting on max volume \"this isn't right because it doesn't follow the lore!\"  You're in the wrong place. \n\nIf someone makes an OC only server, they want the setting without the soap opera canon rules lawyering that the canon server has.  Sure there's going to be limits, but people are supposed to be free to make what they want as long as it makes sense.  I've seen people who make it into mod positions that think an oc server is about remaking a canon character with a different look and name, then complain when they encounter a true OC character that doesn't follow the freaking lore to a T, which defeats the entire damn purpose of making an OC only Server.",

            "body": "As a server owner of multiple group discord roleplays on discord-\n\n*Yeah, there are some issues.*\n\nI can actually explain why there's a gate- often, when discord roleplays are public, people come in that aren't of quality or wouldn't be a great fit for the server. They may waste their time making a sheet when a one-paragraph writing sample can immediately define their strengths and weaknesses. Personally, I *love* this system. It makes it easier to;\n\n\\- Prevent raids\n\n\\- Prevent a waste of time on both the roleplayer and admin's side, as they know the skill level and quality of the RP before the person wastes time asking a bunch of questions\n\n\\- Prevents people who don't read anything from gaining access to the server \\[ **This is a real problem, and it's ridiculous. I have a full-on guide, handholdy and all, on what to read on my server. People just expect you to waste your time after all that organization on telling them what they want to hear. \\]**\n\nI understand why someone wouldn't like the prompt requirement. However, for me, the gate is necessary and I would recommend it to any server owner promptly. It tells me who actually cares about being in the RP, can put forth the effort, and wants more than to be spoon-fed information they should be able to access themselves easily with the guide I created.\n\nWe do our sheets on google docs, and all of them are held in one channel. We have a one session per channel rule, so it doesn't get too mixed up. We *do* allow most channels to be visible, and we don't limit contact between someone and the rest of the group. It is true that roleplay quality has gone down over the years, but for the most part, I don't expect much from servers regardless unless I know the owner and their ability.\n\nAlso, for the record, *I hate aimlessness.* When someone makes a character and expects a story to be handed to them rather than making their character have goals, hopes and dreams, it's gross. People I know, and myself, don't do this. However, it's more common amongst random people to jump in and expect to have an entire story presented to them and have their character's purpose given to them. There are some who do make their own character have a goal, but they're rather rare. I hope this can be remedied someday. \n\nYou're not wrong in it being confusing to navigate in the beginning. Everyone has a different standard for what looks like a 'good' discord server. I've seen a server that thought it was a good server where there was no organization at all, the admins weren't separate from people and they didn't stick out so nobody knew who ran things, and they liked it 'just as it was'. Lower quality servers tend to settle for less when it comes to organization. \\[ I did not stay in that server long, because channels being all over the place hurts my brain. \\]",

I don't mind smaller servers -- in fact, I think I'd prefer a small but dedicated RP-base who's open to integrating new players into things by posting want ads, suggesting plot threads -- even just answering a simple question of \"what/who do you need more of?\" Like, if it's a supernatural setting and there are tons of vamps and werewolves and such running around, but not enough regular humans, then I'd rather play the regular human since it fills a niche.\n\nBut I think I also tend to come at things from a different mindset. I tailor characters to fit the RP I'm doing, whether it's one-on-one or group-based. I look for a spot to fill and come up with someone to fill it. Whereas I think a lot of players just have characters they want to play and they'll look for a server that vaguely fits the mold.\n\nOh, I was curious, you mentioned:\n\n&gt;Prevent raids\n\nWhat does that mean? Folks will \"raid\" a server? To what end? Just to mess with the admin? Bring in a bunch of players and, what, just spam the channels, cause trouble? I've never encountered that before so I'm curious. Seems like a giant waste of time!",

            "body": "So, the way I have my server set up is simple; everyone is able to see every channel, they just can't speak in every channel. They have a designated introductory channel where they can get to know people and discuss and ask questions. They can see all other discussion channels, and every channel for RP. Only difference is, they can't type in them until they write for a prompt! It's definitely not discouraged- you have the right to see if the crowd and the roleplay are up to your tastes and standards. I'd never want to force someone to stay where they didn't feel like they'd enjoy, and I wouldn't hide the ongoing activity in the server from them. \\[ Sounds a bit counter-intuitive! \\]\n\nI like people who fill niches. Often, my staff is kind and friendly, but there can be a lot of entitled roleplayers who believe our time is theirs. I spend my time full-time in school and there can be a lot of people who are impatient or rude toward staff, but we're all grown adults with jobs and obligations. I think the issue comes from there being a lot of unoccupied children, but I don't usually find myself being rude, just blunt \\[ although sometimes people don't think there's any difference between the two. \\] because it wastes less time to just say it like it is.\n\nWe do have plenty of spots to fill in ours, roles, but it seems like you're right- people want *specific* roles they seek to play in servers. Few are adaptable and many just re-use old characters. That's not a problem- I love re-working entire characters, but they usually pay no mind to the lore or the setting and post the exact same character they used in their last RP down without making any changes.\n\nOf note regarding 1x1 RPs; I tried for the first time about a month ago, and I met someone whose prompt I was really interested in, and they kept saying they'd do things like make a server, make character sheets, but in the end that was relegated to me and they put forth no effort whatsoever/consistently forgot about things and I was the one initiating. After they showed no further effort or consistency, I just kinda gave up. I have difficulties with 1x1 because I'm worried the same will happen again.\n\nAlso, I've experienced multiple raids. The reasons people will raid your server are;\n\n\\- Either you've done something they perceive as wrong that have offended them\n\n\\- To troll\n\n\\- To protest being banned\n\nThere are few cases where I've seen a just raid, as most do it to cause trouble. The only time I've ever seen a raid being used for good is when someone stole all of a server owner's hard work and someone made the server that stole it entirely aware of the theft via a raid. Honestly, the reasoning changes from person to person, but generally; most of the time, it's to cause trouble and to disrupt and inconvenience the server.",

There's definitely more of an uphill battle to find a 1x1 partner you vibe well with, and it can take a lot of trial and error. That being said, when it *does* work out, it's amazing! The two of you have way more control over the story, directing where it goes, what sorts of characters you encounter (since you're each playing them all) and it can be a bit more planned out, like a novel. In fact, I've written the equivalent of a trilogy of novels with two different players, so we got to play out whole sagas with a big cast of characters (some just one-offs, but plenty who were recurring). There's more freedom to jump around in the storyline, include time-skips, summarize chunks of time, figure out what scenes are necessary and what's just extraneous fluff. \n\nI feel like, in the group RPs, since everyone is kind of their own \"main character,\" there's not as much of a directed storyline, so the RP feels more meandering and filled with endless meet-and-greets or who's hooking up with who (which, don't get me wrong, I'm all down for romance in the RP, but if that's *all* there is, it gets old). \n\nAnyway, they each have their pros and cons. My dream is to somehow find a small enough group that you still get the fun group dynamic (and it's not so dependent on one other person), but there's still an over-arching plotline and all the characters and their plotlines sort of feed into it, and everyone can help direct the storyline together. May be a pipe-dream, but one can hope!",
