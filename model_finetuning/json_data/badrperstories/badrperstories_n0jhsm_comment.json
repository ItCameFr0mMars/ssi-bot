It's more to kill any sort of plausible deniability that \"oh maybe x misunderstood somehow\" (Which yeah, an oblivious/'oblivious' stalker is still a fucking pain in the ass and needs to go away).  Me saying I didn't want to be in contact then hitting up the officerteam with \"hey x isn't leaving me alone\" helped keep tabs on it and eventually the dude was banned from two communities because there was no plausible deniability left.",

When did people become so fragile and so entitled? I say that as someone who has been ghosted multiple times. So, it's not like I don' t understand the frustration. But, some of these rpers take it way too personally. This is supposed to be for fun and no one is getting paid for their time. I know it can be exhausting trying to find a partner that clicks with you, but that has always been part of the territory of online anything. \n\nRp is not for everyone. You have to develop some serious people skills, boundary setting skills, and also, just learn to let some things go. No one deserves to be stalked online because they wanted to engage in a *hobby*.",
