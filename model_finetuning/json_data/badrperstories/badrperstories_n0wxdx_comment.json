A toxic person isn't gonna go 'Understandable have a gud day' when the boundaries are set, they extinction-burst hard and eventually discard because a person who calls Rping with somebody else cheating is uh... not gonna get better in the span of that Rp partnership.  They might complain a person was too vague about boundaries but they were absolutely looking for people with that struggle to begin with - because when they come up against someone who goes 'uhh no' from the getgo they tantrum and leave.  They want somebody with no boundaries to steamroll, they also get mad at the normal human emotions that come from being steamrolled by a pusher because then they would have to look at themselves a little too hard and Mr. \"you cheated on me by rpin with somebody else\" isn't gonna do that.\n\nEnd of the day it doesn't help but you're not responsible for someone displaying some of the, frankly, abusive behaviour issues listed in point#1.  It's like spoiling a child and expecting them to behave except not really because... well, they're ideally adults at that point or they're teenagers you're not playing the role of authority figure for.\n\nAnyway yeah agreed on the listings, have been unpacking codependency and I'd lapse into doing the items on category#2 even if the player wasn't toxic because I had them on a weird pedestal and didn't want to lose them by 'fucking up' eg wanting something incompatible with theirs.  You wind up losing them anyway and the cycle continues so welp.",
