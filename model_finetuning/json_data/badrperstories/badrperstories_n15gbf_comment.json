Usually, since this is the only goal, it's always rushed and half assed- then once the characters get together it either 1) becomes sexual and 2) people usually run out of ideas and it gets boring.   \n\n\nLike- I don't get why people dont wanna explore other kinds of relationships that can probably be more interesting in the end- like why not have characters just stay friends? Why not have enemies? why not even have characters be family and explore that kind of relationship? there's so many fun things you can do with rps, like, why stick to one dynamic when there's endless possibilities??  \n\n\nAnd because everyone wants the same thing, it's so hard to find people who wanna rp with you, man, like you say \"No romance please\" and that removes 90 percent of rpers from being interested",

Like no I\u2019m not going to change fundamental traits just so that he can date you Janette.\n\nThis made me laugh because it's so relatable. I play villains, and I've had a couple of fantastic ships develop with them with time and effort, but I keep getting people wanting either 1. the asshole villain, who doesn't care about anyone, to fall in love with their character for no real reason. I have had people fully believe that my murderous, tyrant villain would just be the *perfect* loving boyfriend (because they expect me to write him as the perfect boyfriend despite his canon traits.) Or 2. an enemies-to-lovers type thing, except their hero keeps treating my villain/ex-villain like shit, yet he's supposed to be okay with it and fall in love anyway.

I ended up shipping him with another character, causing this person to get upset and constantly ship her character with mine. It didn't help that her character was an anime Mary Sue. \n\nAnother involves an old toxic group I used to be a part of. These people were constantly talking about their ships and romances, which made me question what the plot even was. The world building was there, but it seems like ships were majority of discussion. I couldn't even figure out what was going on, which made me care less. I did try to get some ships since everyone else was doing so, but they would just be uninterested in my characters or tell me I should give my characters ideas that'll make them interesting.

It tends to be much less interesting for most people to make 1x1\u2019s highly plot driven because there are so few people helping world build or who are able to influence the plot. \n\n1x1\u2019s require your characters to spend a high amount of proximity together, which often brings about romance unless it\u2019s familial based. It also doesn\u2019t work well for villains in my experience, because they don\u2019t stick around for long. \n\nI once did a very small group 5x5/7x7 to cover all bases but at the end of the day, good communication will often fix this, and groups are the best way to find highly plot oriented stories while avoiding romance completely.",
