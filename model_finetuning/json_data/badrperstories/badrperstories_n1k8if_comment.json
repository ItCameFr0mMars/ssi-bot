Even if you spam your activity with \"hey, if anybody I'm rping with still wants to continue pm me.\"\n\nSomeone on here pointed it out to me, how some people who agree to long-term roleplays such as slowburns don't actually stick around long enough to do the actual slowburn part. Some people who say they'll do long-term aren't necessarily going to actually do long-term. Roleplay can be both fun and incredibly frustrating because it's between two or more people. People are bound to ditch you, even if they say they won't. And you might ditch them without even realizing it.\n\nIt's honestly been awhile since I've had a partner whose lasted more than a month. I've had one person who I've connected with and they're on an almost permanent hiatus due to college it seems. Surprisingly, they're the one person whose writing I never get bored of, so what's basically \"ghosting\" doesn't bother me. I'm really hoping they'll come back soon though, they're what's keeping my enjoyment in writing steady.",

As someone who was always thrown into the deep end (with work and with college), it surprises me that some people actually need that poke. I\u2019m naturally forgetful too. If I don\u2019t write something down and it\u2019s not OMG important, I will forget about it. So\u2026I\u2019ve learned to write it down and developed a system where I don\u2019t forget who I need to respond to/who I need to poke. I understand that not everyone is like that but\u2026at the same time get your shiz together. If you\u2019re busy fine, cool. Just give me a heads up or something.\n\nOh yeah. I\u2019ve had that happen before. One of my current RP partners intentionally does slow burns to weed those people out. And I really didn\u2019t blame him for it. Sorry you\u2019ve had these experiences too though. And yeah, you\u2019re right. But that\u2019s also what seems to make it more exciting. Since you have someone to bounce your ideas off of and you don\u2019t 100% know what may be next on the RP. \n\nGlad you could find someone like that. It\u2019s really rare.
