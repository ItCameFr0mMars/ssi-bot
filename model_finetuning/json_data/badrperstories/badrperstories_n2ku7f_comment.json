            "body": "The way you phrased your question was maybe a little misleading. If you had asked me that question, I would probably have answered 'Yeah, sure.' even though I mostly write male characters and would also have wanted to write one in that specific setting, because I don't hate writing female characters and it sounds like such a general question.\n\nThere are some possibilities here:\n\n\\-she really did not read your ad in detail, but was also a annoyed/offended by you overexplaining. You saying stuff like that you find mxf boring might have made her think that now, she has to defend herself in some way by stating that she was not looking for that and you are in the wrong here. It wasn't really a fruitful conversation, she did not want to engage with it anymore but you still wanted to, and so she blocked you. In the end, her commenting 'sure' when it came to almost every part of the planning phase is a big red flag anyway.\n\n\\-the other possibility is that she did understand what you wanted, and assumed that you  would know that the prompts were of course going to be mxm when you already explained to her what you were looking for and it is mentioned in your search (especially when she copied these prompts from another website). When you asked whether she wrote female characters she might have thought that it was a general question and not asking if she wanted to write a female character in this specific roleplay. \n\nSo after you told them 'then maybe u messaged the wrong person', she might have gotten annoyed that you assume she did not read and understand your chat and your search, and was offended because of that.\n\nIn the end, blocking you was probably just done because the conversation was over and she did not want to engage with it any longer. Yeah, most people don't block because of that, but some people do because they don't want to have any message about that anymore when in the end, it leads to nothing.\n\nI would honestly say it was the best that you found out early that you are incompatible.",

Getting one worded responses and vague ones just isn't my thing. \n\nPerhaps I'd gone overboard in explaining, that's just my usual go to when the conversation comes down to this. Perhaps we were on different pages and looking at the situation differently because i was used to this happening. Getting questions for mxf when i stayed I do mxm. Plus they said they were waking up so I again assumed maybe they didn't ask the right person / skimmed / something or other. \n\nAnd yeah, I guess it did sound like a general question, and i could have phrases it better. \n\nand i guess i was going off assumptions a little too much here. Piecing together all the female things. Guess I'd just thought they'd specify somewhere they'd be playing a male, or else i would've asked or said that. But since i was dead set they wanted to do a female I just left it at mxf is boring.\n\nBut yeah i think I was just mostly put off by the blocking part since I've had similar conversations that go into me just being like oh or them going 'oh'.

I quite enjoy chatting abt rp and maybe we could rp eventually? It'd be nice to explore different character dynamics! I mainly play mxm Romance! i write a lot and put a lot into my characters, even side characters!

Because many people just use it as a 'this conversation is over anyway, I don't want to deal with it any longer, bye' sort of thing, and not a 'this person offended me deeply and did something that was unforgivable' thing. I think it is a little bit rude to just block someone, but then again they said good day twice and probably thought there is no roleplay happening anyway, no need to explain myself. \nYeah, the more graceful reaction would probably be 'Oh, this is a misunderstanding, I actually want to write a male character' or 'Sorry, I misread this part, we aren't a match, goodbye.', but yeah...some people in this hobby tend to overreact a little or are simply not that polite.\nOverexplaining is also not a bad thing, but if it is met with someone who easily insulted, it can be taken as patronising/offensive, and people might feel the need to defend themselves. I don't think you necessarily did anything wrong, it was a misunderstanding, I just wanted to shed some light on what could have happened.\n\nBelieve me, I already got my fair share of people who I assumed did not read my searches, sometimes it was true and sometimes not. Sometimes I also asked to much of 'Hey, do you really read that I specified no romance?/You know that I will write a male character, right?' which can come of as annoying, but almost all people are understanding because we all know some people who don't read searches and it is nothing personal.\n This person is a walking red flag, even if they read the search and would be down to write a male character.",
