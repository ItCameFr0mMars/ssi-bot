The inconsistency causes conflicts time and time again. \n\nSome people believe several paragraphs worth of content is the only way to roleplay, and any other method is inferior.\n\nOthers believe writing too much takes away the other partner\u2019s opportunity to respond, and as such is bad roleplay.\n\nAs far as grammatical errors, I\u2019ve heard Grammarly is a decent choice. Otherwise there are books you can read that will detail how sentence structure works, and how to properly punctuate your writing. It\u2019s a skill you will need to develop yourself.",
