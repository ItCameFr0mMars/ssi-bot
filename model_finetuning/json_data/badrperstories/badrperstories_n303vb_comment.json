In fact a lot of the time the character is completely hating their situation, but that may be the exact point of the kink (think non-con, for example). And a lot of people really don't like it when their characters are nicely treated, etc, as they the player find it boring. So it really depends on the person, I guess. In any case though I definitely agree that there needs to be a line drawn between IC and OOC, regardless of what anyone is or isn't turned on by. I think a good way to say it is, \"turn me on with your IC, not your OOC\". Great thread title btw, I lol'd.",

This seems to be the case with a number of female RPers, though there are some male RPers as well. I can't say I fully understand it but I'm guessing it has to do with how easily personal boundaries may be crossed when discussing such things OOC. Just because someone wants to be turned on / turn on their partner doesn't mean they want an actual intimate relationship with their partner, which is sometimes exactly what the other party is looking to do by mentioning such things. And the weirdness created from that overrides the fun of the RP. Something along those lines, perhaps.",
