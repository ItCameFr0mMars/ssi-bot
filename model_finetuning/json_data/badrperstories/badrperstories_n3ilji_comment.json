If you communicate that plus how you truly feel about it (the it's \"like writing a novel with erotic scenes in it\" part, basically), your partner may not have as big of an issue with it compared to if you were to be carrying erotic convos both in and out of character and planning to go meet up with them at a hotel someday or something.

The main difference is that smutty roleplay is sexual back-and-forth that is basically structured like normal cyber sex would be.  It being in 3rd person, done with fictional characters, having a story attached, and not for the purpose of getting off doesn't matter in our case.  It's still two people describing a detailed sexual back-and-forth and therefore cheating in our relationship.\n\nHowever, there are lots of couples who don't see it that way.  There are tons of people who are totally fine with it!  It's not cheating at all!  There's no wrong answer here!  There's only what's right for the individuals involved.\n\nI will say that it's something people absolutely do need to talk to their partner/s about, though.

Is it something you feel you have to hide from your significant other? Does it make them uncomfortable?\n\nCheating in this context is breaking your partners trust when you have to operate in such a way you withhold what you're doing so they won't be the wiser. \n\nEven if you think you're doing to protect them because \"well they don't know the difference between real cybering and just smut writing, its just easier this way!\" \n\nIf they know what you do on the computer is rp with strangers, and they're okay with smut writing and understand what it is, then clearly it's not cheating when you both have a clear understanding of what is going on and can separate reality from fiction. \n\nSince you're asking if this counts as cheating, I'm going to assume you haven't spoken with your real life significant other about this because you would have had the answer for yourself. If they don't know, have a conversation with them about it. \"Hey babe, you know how I pretend to be an elf lord on the internet during my downtime? Well, in her story she finds herself in heated situations with her bodyguard. How comfortable are you with me writing erotic scenes involving her?\"\n\nThen you have that discussion on what is expected, what the understanding is, and if they're cool with it, then its not cheating. If they're not cool with it, but you continue to do it anyway behind their back and have to keep it secret from them by writing smut till 5am, then you're breaking their trust, and that's cheating.",

Maybe if it was canon characters that don\u2019t match the writers\u2019 IRL genders but idk.\n\nI don\u2019t project onto fictional characters but a lot of roleplayers do and I\u2019ve had a lot of ex-RP partners who \u201ctotally didn\u2019t use RP to substitute a lack of an IRL relationship\u201d who then pushed our ooc relationship too far and developed some kind of weird virtual feelings for me. So I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with my SO writing something as intimate as smut with an internet stranger because even if I trust my SO I wouldn\u2019t trust some rando online.\n\nThat\u2019s just my reasoning. I think it\u2019s totally valid to decide that it\u2019s fine in your relationship. A lot of people are comfortable with their SOs doing/buying OnlyFans or interacting with camgirls. Whatever you prefer so long as you respect your SO\u2019s boundaries.\n\nEdit: but I\u2019d kinda consider it cheating if your SO has no idea. Just me. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I mean, otherwise, why *do* people write detailed ERP smut? We *don't* write smut with minors because it could legit be against the law. Well, there's a reason for that, isn't there??? \n\nIt doesn't look to me like RPing smut is as innocent an activity as I have seen people make it out to be... I have always felt weird about RPing smut with an RPer who had an SO or was married. I wouldn't make a stink about it though as they and their partner seemed okay with it. \n\nI honest to god cannot see why it isn't considered cheating on some level... it's great if people don't think so and are not bothered by it, and I suspect there's just some kind of thought process I am not considering but I really... just get confused by it.",
