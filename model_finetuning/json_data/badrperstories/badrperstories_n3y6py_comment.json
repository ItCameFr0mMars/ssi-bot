I know several people could jump to the conclusion of the cat boy being implied alien. and then y'all backed out on that later on even? like being an alien on their side would mess up immersion (after y'all saying it could be an alien) like y'all werent even consistent. this is just bad communication on both parts and if you really think they absorb themselves into the center of the rp when they play then you should talk to them about it.",
