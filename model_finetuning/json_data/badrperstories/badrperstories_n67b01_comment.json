As in both can be toxic, but often the toxicity presents differently. \n\nFor example, a typical toxic man may pressure you for ERP. A typical toxic woman will try to force you to ship with them, but will get jealous if you use the same character to ship with others.\n\nForcing you into a sexual situation you don\u2019t want to be in is by and large a bigger red flag\u2014or at least one that\u2019s easier to recognize, and more difficult to ignore. \n\nPossessiveness may not be so readily apparent until something triggers it. \n\nHence why someone may stay with a toxic woman longer.",

            "body": "I think that the main point when it comes to how long we tolerate a toxic rp partner is how good they are at masking their toxic traits. Some examples:\n\n\\-a person who writes 'Hey, our characters have to sleep with each other, or I will end the roleplay' after I told them that I don't do ERP and when we have only written one reply each in the roleplay is going to get blocked immediately. However, in the past, I had a lot of roleplaypartners who writes the roleplay for a while (let's say 20 replies each), and then were like 'I am soooo sorry to bother you, but could we include a little sex scene? I just want to feel the deep connection between our characters...don't worry if you don't get everything right! A healthy relationship needs a sex life, and your character is not asexual, so..' \n\nSo I basically felt like I was in the 'wrong' for not writing it, and a quick cut like 'Yeah sorry, no way, you are disrespecting my boundaries, goodbye' felt rude and like and overreaction (and I already enjoyed the roleplay and did not want to loose it because of something like that).\n\n\\-The same with post frequency issues. I am against poking for replies, and make it clear in my searches. I had a lot of partners who basically wrote every 10 minutes 'Time to roleplay?'/'Write now or I will leave!' and with behavior like that, it is quite easy to leave the roleplay. But there are also those people who contact you with 'Hey, I am so excited to roleplay! I was wondering if you could reply? Don't feel pressured.' So you read that and think, ah, what a nice message, and you don't say anything negative. Until their behavior becomes pushy, but you feel like you missed the point when it was still okay to have that boundary. It's harder to say something.\n\n\\-personal boundaries feel like a larger problem than roleplay boundaries. If someone gives of the vibe that they are romantically/sexually interested in me as a person, that is the biggest red flag to exist (for me). This is something I mostly experienced with male writers, because most of my writing partners know that I am a woman (and most of my female writing partners are not interested in women and therefore not interested in me)\n\n\\-A lot of people are masters when it comes to making themselves appear as a victim. They are just sooo sad that you seem to have fun with other people, don't you want to reassure them that everything is alright? and then it gets worse...\n\nSome people are very good when it comes to making you question whether you might be in the wrong, and they wait a little to built trust, so that you think 'would this person really do something hurtful like that? Can't be, there must be a good reason for them acting that way.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did experience this more with female partners, but only because I predominately have female partners. I don't feel that female writers are less likely to force you to ERP, I had a lot of experiences like that because I write male characters, I would say that maybe 30% of female writer's who contact me want to ignore that boundary.",

            "body": "I've experienced the same - in how I've tolerated female RPers far more than male ones. But I can rationalize such a behavior with two theories, which however are based on a wild conjecture - that there are more male RPers than female ones.\n\nOn one hand? If you're like me - so, more than happy to play with just about *anyone*, so long as they present the desire to write *creatively -* then doing so with a female RPer is automatically 'higher priority' for no other reason than the *subconscious* making it feel... *rarer*. Scarcity value might be an economic term but I think it can apply here as well.\n\nOn the other? Us human beings are very strange creatures. We tend to remember *bad* experiences far more (longer, with more details) than good ones, a survival mechanism maybe (a caveman will have a much easier time remembering the *one* berry bush that gave him a stomachache, than the nine berry bushes before it that were all fine and dandy). So let's assume that the male/female RPer split is 70/30, that you had 100 RPs and that bad RPers are 10% regardless of gender. Then you'll end up with 7 instances of bad encounters with male writers, and only 3 with female ones.\n\nSo it's easy to see a bias emerging, even if statistically speaking it's all equal across sexes and they can be equally bad.",

            "body": "Edit: well, that ran long.  I guess I needed to get it off my chest.  TL;DR I have definitely had bad female rpers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSure.  I've had a female rper demand I not plot ooc because it would ruin her immersion, and then punish me for misreading her \"signals\" ic when I really couldn't tell what she wanted.  I had a different female partner who kept trying to mind-rape my character and kept having to be talked out of it, just really pushing for these shattering noncon scenes I didn't want.  Both were technically good writers, so I stayed through the early red flags when I shouldn't have.  I did a badrpers post about the latter of these, on an older account that's deleted now, but not the former because it's recent and fresh and she was rude and passive aggressive when I said I wanted to stop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith most partners of either sex, things end because people ghost, or real life just interferes and they're no longer available (this did happen on my end once, where I had to end several rps at once because of family issues needing my time).  I don't post about those because that's not bad rp, it's just life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe other problem that has caused me to end things with female rpers was where they gradually transitioned from mostly rp to mostly telling me about their personal problems ooc.  Women seem to do more of this where men are more likely to get creepy sexually.  The main time I ran into women misbehaving that way is nsfw so, warnings for that on the rest of this post.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe worst experience I've had with just women was on an rp forum that no longer exists now.  I met one of the admins on this very subreddit, and she invited me because she liked a post I did.  If memory serves, there were all women when I joined, and we picked up one or two dudes over time.  I knew the sub was going to be nsfw, but I was not clear that a major portion of the characters would be part of an institutionalized rape culture.  See, they were demons, but there were very few demon women and they were privileged, so male demons stole mortal women as wives or brood mares (since their children would be demons due to convenient genetics).  I rp'd with the one person who was not into rape kink (that friendly admin I mentioned kept calling it \"hard seduction\" because it was rape by a hot guy in luxurious surroundings, with forced climax) for a while, but I could not avoid seeing some things I find very unpleasant.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe admin made it clear I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to do, and nothing had to happen to my characters, and it was my own fault for reading any post marked nsfw, but it was the currency and main theme of the sub and I had to find awkward workarounds, like playing a character whose job was medically treating the victims of all this rape.  It was hard to get real plots going either, because the admins all had god-tier characters who could fix any non-fetishistic problem an ordinary character could reasonably have.  The one time I tried the admin really resented me asking to delay bringing in the god-character.  That, combined with the family circumstances I mentioned before, finally pushed me away from it.  When I said I needed to go, and why, they said they were confiscating my characters and would write them themselves from then on.  The admin also tended to shill her book to try and get forum members to buy it, sometimes she played her book characters in rp, and there was a weird inclusion of definitely marijuana in this high fantasy universe so all the major characters could smoke dope.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe whole thing just left me exhausted and never wanting to do forum rp again.",
