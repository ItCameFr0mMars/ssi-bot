I always put samples in my journal because it gives people insight into my writing and rping style without them having to even ask. It also gives me quick access to my past writing if I decide to join a moderated game that asks for writing samples.\n\nI don't mind P.M. ing you one of my character journals if you want to see what it looks like.

I do enjoy inserting IC journal entries or letters when I can, as it gives me a chance to *really* get into my character's head, although I suppose something like that could also be used to address OOC concerns in a roundabout way.
