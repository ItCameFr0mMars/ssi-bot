A user was very interested to the point they private messaged me and volunteered themselves. Great!\n\nExcept when it came to characters we were going to play, they admit they didn't know anything about Warcraft, the races, or lore. And instead asked if it was acceptable to RP as basically the uh, dragon maid in that one anime with the big tits. (Which was also their discord picture)\n\nAnd I'm like :|\n\nI can understand being so starved for RP that'll jump at anyone offering, but why jump into something you don't know much about, or worse, you're not willing to research the world and lore itself? Like I'd be more than happy to help, but I learned my lesson from a previous rp partner that you don't do all their homework for them.",

Someone contacted me today and we are both canon blind - but we are also willing to plot ooc and learn about each other's fandom lore. It's Critical Role and The Untamed. They both fall under fantasy, both have supernatural elements and undead.  We exchanged wikis, discussed the characters. We're winging it, but it's fun.\n\nThe difference is we are both contributing. \n\nWhen someone just pops up because they think your character looks cool and makes no effort that's when things go downhill quickly.",
