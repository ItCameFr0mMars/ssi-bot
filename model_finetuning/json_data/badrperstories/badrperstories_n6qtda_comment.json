I also don't put too much stock in trying to match each other either. I tend to think more in terms of content and pacing - what do I want to have happen in this reply? What will it contribute to the story, character development, and so on? At the moment, my partners seem to think/operate the same way and so our posts are usually 1000 words at minimum, usually more. In the past I've been comfortable at 400-700 words too. I'd be fine with rapid fire shorter, rapid fire posts but I haven't done much of that lately. It just depends.\n\nThe same thinking goes for how I divide the post too. I don't think about how many words each paragraph is per se, it's more about grouping it into different ideas. Visually though, big paragraphs are an eyesore, so I seem to unconsciously start a new paragraph if it's 150-200 words.",
