As difficult as it might be at the moment I'd recommend trying to think of something else and maybe try to distract yourself with other entertainment until you feel a bit more yourself! Watch a movie, go for a walk... anything!\n\nWhen you're ready you could also start a character workshop or some such to get a second opinion on said OC and how you could maybe market them to catch more partners?",
