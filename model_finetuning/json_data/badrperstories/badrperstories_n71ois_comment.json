            "body": "Sorry to hear you've had bad experiences with doubling! It must be quite frustrating to put in a lot of effort into 'their' story and not have it reciprocated for 'yours'. But I use quotes because... if someone is genuinely interested in doubling, there shouldn't be a theirs/yours dynamic, both stories should be equally valued with shared investment - at least in my opinion. \n\nIn some ads I've seen, I've gotten the impression that the offer of doubling is used more as a bait of sorts in order to get someone to play this character for them. Not to say that there's anything wrong with negotiating \"you play X for me and I'll play Y for you\", or that it can't work, but like you've described... clearly it doesn't always pan out equally as you'd expect. \n\nDoubling can be challenging (I don't do it often for that reason!) so I totally agree, you need a greater degree of commitment and care for it to be fulfilling for everyone involved.",

Gotta know the other writer first, two main characters alone are hard enough to write together, let alone four. \n\nHad bad experience previously where the side characters ended up being more important than the main.
