Knowing this, I accepted that the CHARACTER WITH AMNESIA was going to be the one to point out my character's crimes... which I was actually all for! \n\nBut the BBEG was apparently going to keep reading the mind of the amnesiac character every time a part of his memories came back. So much so that, apparently they were going to CHANGE from awakening naturally to having their mind read. \n\nIt was really dumb. I mean I understood the BBEG's involvement since the character I was testing on had some emotional connection to the BBEG, but that was just ridiculous.",
