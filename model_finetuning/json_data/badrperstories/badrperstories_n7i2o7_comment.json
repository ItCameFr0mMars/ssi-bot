Some people use their first reply to give a general impression of their character/their character's life, expect you to do the same, and then get into the interactions.\n\nBut this depends entirely on the scene. If the scene you agreed on takes place in a coffee shop in the afternoon, and their reply has all that stuff about being chased by crazy fans after a concert that took place in the evening and then they meet your character, this is probably not the reason. If their reply was basically the logical explanation how their character ended up near the coffee shop, I would forgive that there is little basis for an interaction (yet) and assume it was just their introduction to the roleplay.\n\nIn general, I would always be a bit wary when people write something that seems to ignore everything we planned beforehand and portrays their character in a 'everyone thinks they are so cool' light though. And that they did not seem to be interested anymore is another thing that makes me think that they had a very specific expectation how the roleplay should go and bailed when you did not meet their expectations.",

After I read their reply, which was long but left me very little meat to reply to (aside from their famous character being chased around by fans), I just\u2026completely lost interest. \n\nThis is where you could talked in OOC with them, or talk to them after the reply.\n\nDid they not reply after yours? If they were gone for a week without notice then sure, deleting is fine. However, ideally if someone is active and talking in OOC or RP or otherwise, then you can negotiate what's going on. \n\nI like to talk to my RP partners. Sometimes missteps and miscommunications happen, and the more honest you are with them the better. However, if they're not replying within a week with no previous forewarning-- yeah it likely over. \n\nSetting and making sure expectations are on the same page matters. The better you and your partners are at both being honest about and communicating this, the better the relations go...\n\nOf course, some people are dishonest, or people mismatch and so we're here. Still, give the honest ones a chance!",

I wrote the starter out, and said my character bumped into someone (and described their character as they had described him to me). But their reply was about him running around avoiding fans. At the end of it, he was all the way across the festival on the big stage\u2026which is pretty far away from where my character was. I was unsure how to tie that scene they wrote to the plot so my reply was basically my character meeting up with her friends. That\u2019s the reply they didn\u2019t reply to.\n\nYes! That\u2019s exactly the \u201coof\u201d feeling I got. It\u2019s okay for your character to be confident. Some people are so some OCs are. But painting them like EVERYONE thinks they\u2019re cool and likes and knows their music is a red flag for me. I\u2019m glad you brought that point up as I couldn\u2019t really phrase that \u201coof\u201d feeling I got ;;",

            "body": "I think it depends on your writing style and whether you and your partner enjoy reading something like that or not, but also on the story. For example, it makes more sense in an isekai setting where the characters find themselves transported to a magical word.\nIt can be interesting for the other writer to get a short glimpse into the life that your character lived before (especially if it is very different, for example if he was a shut-in but in the fantasy world with new won powers he is much more out-going). Of course you could just say: Yeah my character never left the house much. But some people prefer to really see the character in action, at least in some paragraphs, to get a better feeling of them. \nThese kind of introductionary replies are also great to set the stage and describe the world in vivid terms. Of course, we have already discussed what the world looks like, but a vivid description with maybe a glimpse on how the character relates to this world can be fun and interesting. Even if the characters don't know certain information about the other, doesn't mean it can't be interesting to know for the writer.\nFor example if the writer knows that the character has a lot of evil thoughts and is portrayed as rude to others in the first reply, but then is sickly sweet when they meet your character...can be an interesting contrast and makes you wonder what he is up to. It is much more powerful to show it this way instead of just saying 'yeah he can be kind of an asshole sometimes' in the planning phase.\nOften, this kind of replies do have a little interaction in the end but not much (yet) to give the other writer more space to shortly described what let their own character there without limiting them to much.\nBut if you like that kind of writing or not entirely depends on your writing style and your preferences.",
