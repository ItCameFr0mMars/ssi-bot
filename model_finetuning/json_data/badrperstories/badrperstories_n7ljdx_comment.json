There are plenty of people out there who will RP whilst being considerate of your health issues and boundaries, what makes this guy so special that you\u2019ll put up with this treatment?\n\nIf you wanted to be generous, tell him how it makes you feel when he\u2019s constantly pushing. If he still pushes (and I count backing off for a while and starting to push in a few weeks or whatever in this) then cut him off. Life is too short and RP is too fun to put up with that kind of rubbish.\n\nGood luck!",

But, this person is saying many wrong things and upsetting *you.* To me, that is much more important. It definitely sucks to get back on the partner search, especially if you've been feeling down. But I think it sucks even more to be struck in a disrespectful partnership. I fear this person is the type to keep on pushing your boundaries further and further if there are no repercussions. Still, if you want to give him one more chance you can lay out your boundaries and give a warning before you end things, but you have to be prepared to follow through. \n\nGood luck, take care, and I hope you feel better!",
