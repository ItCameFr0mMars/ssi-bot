            "body": "Well, let me reassure you about something - you're not the only one to feel inspired by good RP! I personally feel that both inspiration *and* excitement are contagious (in a good way), and once they start bouncing between the RPers involved, then you'll quickly end up with a snowball effect of sheer written awesomeness. *That* is what makes for a great RP. It's a two-way street (or uh, a highway I guess if it's beyond 1x1).\n\nAnd in that two-way street, there's *no* room for RPing with someone out of pity or as self-sacrifice. I don't think that's even possible. Getting your imagination engaged, your mind - curious about what will happen next, or curious how the *other* will react to elements you've just introduced/developed - those are the only ingredients, in my mind, that drive someone to not just give a reply for the hell of it (or the reasons you gave), but give you something to *enjoy* replying to.\n\nSo, tell that little voice to take a break and be quiet for a while. :)\n\nI also want to say that while I don't think I have impostor syndrome, I still doubt the quality of my own writing sometimes. But I think this is natural - writing is one of those skills/talents that need to be not just exercised, but perfected over time... but at the same time? This applies to *everyone.*",

But we're also all human. I'm not saying this to you to make you feel like you're not a unique human. I just want to urge you to keep in mind that everyone around you is going through the same thing.   \n\n\nThey might not have the same exact disorder or syndrome, but the baseline feelings of not being enough, of people smiling to your face and laughing behind your back, wishing you would go away but being too polite to say anything - we all go through it. And in knowing that, you can know that your friends are genuinely your friends. You're walking through life, each of you fighting your own battles, and sticking together through them.   \n\n\nNo one would honestly \"sacrifice themselves\" or their time to distract you from someone else. That's not how this hobby works. They're writing with you because they love to. Your over-excitement is a compliment to them. They're going through their own stuff, and your writing is helping them navigate it by giving them a place to escape to, and vice versa. You and all your friends are helping one another process. This is a beautiful thing.   \n\n\nMy disorder isn't IS, but I definitely struggle a lot with anxiety. I am convinced that my whole server hates me most of the time, but I offset that by taking a daily count of what I'm thankful for. I am so powerfully thankful to the players who have stayed in the server, writing stories with me, writing in the world I've made, and messaging me off and on to tell me how much they appreciate me. I could let my anxiety tell me they're just saying that to get something from the Admin, or maybe they're just saying that because they're afraid of me. Those are genuine fears. I just have to trust that the people who call themselves my friends do so with as pure of intentions as I do. I take them at face value, because the fact is they have not given me a reason not to trust them. It helps.   \n\n\nSometimes, you just have to catch yourself feeling this way and go watch a show, read a book, take a nap, take a shower. That noise is a disorder in your head. It's not real. It's not fact. You are genuinely cherished, appreciated, and loved by your friend group. Believe that until they tell you otherwise.",

            "body": "A mix of grumpiness, exhaustion, and apathy that came with age and chronic illness played the biggest part in overcoming those feelings, but there are a few strategies I learned in therapy that helped me through some of those thoughts.  I know it's hard to rationalize with an irrational fear, but the important thing is to keep trying and hope something sticks.\n\nHere are things that helped me.  They might be useless to you, but hopefully one of them helps a bit.  YMMV as everyone is different:\n\n1. Ask myself if I would personally act the way I worry they are acting.  Then consider how would I feel if someone accused me of it.  Would I \"sacrifice myself\" playing and socializing with someone I didn't like just so some hypothetical person didn't have to?   I would not do it and I would feel bad if someone thought I did so why would I accuse another person of it?\n2. Remind myself I am not responsible for peoples choices and feelings.  If they want to interact with someone they don't like because they think the alternative is worse, that is their issue, not mine.  Let them work out their own inability to be honest.\n3. Always try to take people by their words and actions.  If they say one thing, tell my brain to shut up when it starts trying to think up alternate motives and meanings.  Literally think \"STOP IT\" when I catch myself doing it.\n4. Work out the worst case scenario in my head and try to be realistic.  You'll usually end up at a similar spot.  Usually, the worst case for me was they would realize they didn't like me and leave.  That showed what I really needed to do was learn to handle rejection better.  Working on the root of the feelings helps a lot.\n5. Give those thoughts a name/persona separate from myself.  When I have those thoughts, tell myself it's just that person being a jerk again.",

I really should stop postponing it.\n\nI don't think, I actually have a major depression, but it was funny, that I actually discovered my problem accidentally. Basically, googled: \"why people sabotage their own success for no apparent reason?\" The answer was \"Fear of success\". After further researching I learned about Impostor Syndrome, that looked like non-flattering, but realistic portrait of myself. It was a big discovery, since I'm extroverted insufferable optimist and nobody ever thought that I could have THAT out of all things. But even that already made me less scared of my feelings. I'll get there, eventually. Thank you so much!",
