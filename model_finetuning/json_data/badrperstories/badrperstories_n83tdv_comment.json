For example, you could say, \"Hey, my OC hasn't had a story arc in a little bit, and I had an idea for something! Do you think we could do this in our RP?\" Then let them know your idea(s) for your character. You can also start a conversation with, \"Hey, do you have a minute to talk about my OC? I have some thoughts I wanted to brainstorm with you.\"\n\nHopefully making it clear it's time for the spotlight to shine on your character for a second will help. If not, it's definitely worth a conversation, and this might be a good way to segue into that discussion.\n\n\"I love hearing about your character, but do you think we could sort of take turns telling about them? I'm starting to feel like you're not interested in my character/not absorbing what I'm saying/this is somehow a competition, and I should have said something to you about it sooner. I love RPing with you, so I wanted to bring this up so we could talk about it.\"",

            "body": "In response to the first part, I\u2019ll say that someone making everything about themselves/their interests while simultaneously putting themselves down can be pretty toxic behavior, depending on the situation. A fixation on self-hate is still a type of fixation on the self, after all, and sometimes people have learned (often through their being treated in a neglectful way at some point in their lives) that being openly and excessively self-critical is a reasonably effective way of garnering sympathy they might be missing elsewhere or might have missed in the past. It\u2019s an unfortunate cause, but that doesn\u2019t mean the behavior isn\u2019t both an unhealthy coping mechanism and also putting a lot onto somebody else. If their self-degradation is affecting how comfortable you feel addressing issues with the person, that\u2019s an indicator that it\u2019s not really a healthy dynamic they\u2019re creating. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re not a therapist working with a client, you\u2019re a friend/collaborator in a hobby the two of you share. You aren\u2019t really in a position to try and fix it; the best you can do for yourself is to try and learn to ignore it, and not avoid topics for fear of setting them off on some self-criticism spiral (which can build resentment in both of you, even if you don\u2019t believe it will and don\u2019t see that happening). \n\nI\u2019ll also play devil\u2019s advocate for a second and say that I occasionally catch myself focusing too much on my own characters in plotting when I feel like my partner isn\u2019t contributing much to ideas, and this can pretty easily happen in headcanon stuff too. I\u2019ve learned over the years to self-correct and find ways to shift the focus on to my partner\u2019s characters when I notice this happening. My point is, though, that on the off-chance you\u2019re not pitching many new ideas (tho to be clear it sounds like you are based on what you\u2019ve written here, so I\u2019m not sure this is really the case) that might be a contributing factor to feeling like the balance is slightly off. \n\nFinally, when you bring this up with them (and I definitely recommend that you do), focus on positive proactive steps you both can take rather than bringing up any negatives about behaviors you don\u2019t like. This will make it less likely that your partner will take it personally (and less likely that they\u2019ll fall into a session of self-flagellation as a consequence). Talk about your desires, maybe be somewhat self-deprecating about it (\u201cHey, this might be a bit silly of me but I\u2019ve really been wanting to do some big plot for my character, do you think we could work on that?\u201d or something similar.) You don\u2019t *have* to do this if you don\u2019t want to, but it can help make the conversation a bit more disarming so they\u2019re less likely to take it personally.",

            "body": "My first long-term RP partner (I'm talking damn near 10 years) was so, so similar to this-- everything was always about her characters, and said characters all followed a very specific trope of character (all strong women, which is fine, but when they rarely have weaknesses &amp; rocking it in male-dominated job roles *every single time*, well...).. plot lines were all ones she thought of, and if I came up with suggestions, they were usually picked down to a shred of my idea and then a new idea that benefitted her character more... etc, you get it.\n\nIt sucked, because she was the only partner I had that I actually got to really write with, but I was also always shoved into playing the same cookie-cutter style male against her female (and she didn't really care if I wasn't a fan of the face, because I care more about the character)... and it backed me into a corner where I was almost afraid to play females and still shy away from full female OCs instead of coming up with something with someone else because of her.\n\nSince I dropped her and all of that toxicness, my writing has improved tenfold, and I've become more comfortable with writing things I wouldn't have wanted to write with her because of how it would have been handled.\n\nLong, empathetic story to say: drop them.  After being the rp partner of a narcissist for 10 years and the romantic partner of a narcissist for 7 years... my life is immensely better without both of them, lol.  Drop them, and find someone who wants to hear your headcanons and your thoughts on how to make the *collaborative writing you're doing* ***together*** even more fun for the **both** of you. \n\nxo",
