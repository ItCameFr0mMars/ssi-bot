Word for word. She literally joined this character on every site with the name slightly changed, but everything else a literal copy and paste, even if it did not apply to the rp she was joining.  \n\nI only really got involved when she was called out on another site and used me as somebody to vouch for her.  Me, somebody who hardly knew her and had known her story was BS the moment she made it up (her posts definitely did not match the writing in the bio).  \n\nShe was banned, nobody else wanted their characters to be stolen and she brought drama, but she kept trying to rejoin the site a bunch under different names after that, once with another character she'd stolen and another time she'd forgotten she already tried with the first one and rejoined it!\n\nI just do not understand people.   Making a new character is fun, in my opinion!  Stealing somebody's hard work is just wrong. I guess if somebody really loved a character I use and asked me, I might agree, but just taking it and calling me the liar? Ugh. The fact they were so quick to just ban you is so sketchy.\n\nI sometimes wondered if she was still out there joining places with stolen characters. Now I play on private forums to avoid that very thing.",

It'd be different if someone was trying to make money off a character created by someone else, but this is just role playing.  It is about having fun writing with others.

            "body": "I don't think that is similiar to playing a canon character. With canon characters, people know what they sign up for. I realize 'Ah, this isn't their own character, it is Harry Potter.' and I approach them because I am looking for someone who can write Harry Potter. When people pretend that canon characters are their own OCs (for example by slightly changing their name) that is generally frowned upon.\n\nIn my opinion, the behavior this person shows is wrong because:\n\n\\-they are giving their fellow writers an incorrect example of how they write. In general, character creation is one of the first way to tell 'Okay, this person might not fit the group roleplay' and a way of checking if they are able to create a character that fits the setting, if their sentences are well-written, and so on. If you just copy and paste someone elses character, people don't get a sample how you write/create characters and how creative you are. Often, people later realize 'This person's character was so well-thought out, but their replies are completely different.' It is a little bit unfair for all members of the group roleplay.\n\n\\-it can create problems for the original creator. Like in this case, the original creator is called a liar because of someone elses behavior and can't take part in the roleplay. Or maybe some people might think that the original creator always copies characters. It is quite scummy in my  opinion to do something like that. Especially if the person continues to lie even after being called out. If a mod encouraged someone stealing characters, oh lord. I can't imagine being too happy about someone letting dishonesty slide. It is unfair for all the other writers.\n\n\\-for me, it is kind of like taking other people's artwork, copying it and then earning the praise. Now, if you take the Mona Lisa and write 'My master study of DaVincis Mona Lisa', people will realize that it is a master study and they will also notice (in most cases) that this is a copy of a famous painting. It is completely different if you take some more unknown person's art, copy it (or even just post the same picture without drawing anything yourself), and write a caption like 'My new OC uwu, it took me so long to complete and design their outfit.' Even if you don't earn money with it, many people would not be flattered that you earn the praise for something they created, especially if they call you a thief if they are called out.\n\nYour cloning solution is also not very well-thought out. Maybe this magic cloning does not even exist in this world, and even if it does, it creates more problem than it solves. It would force the original creator to interact with the character thief a lot (and see how they have butchered their creation), it would create problems like how would the friends react if the same character exists twice, and it would force both writers into a situation they did not sign up for (exploring how life would be like for their character if a clone exists of them).",

I seriously doubt that a plagiarist so unimaginative that they have to steal someone else's *character* would even notice it, or anyone for that matter, not unless the rightful owner shows up and points it out. I can't think of evidence more solid than this. Think of it like a... watermark, except applicable to text.\n\nI don't think it'd work out for past characters, but it may help for future ones.

I play a really niche fandom and the author actually encourages roleplaying her work and answers questions when they come along, and the few sites I have seen have been set in her world (which is based on our own with a fantasy twist) but never uses her actual characters.  I have only ever played original characters, and besides this fandom, only original settings, so my opinion is really limited there.\n\nIf an author/artist asked not to, I'd definitely respect their wishes.  This girl I speak about had been asked many times to not play this character, or at least alter it a bit, and she refused. It is about fun, you are right, but at the same time, it really isn't fun to watch somebody take your hard work and use it elsewhere and when you want credit for that, get called a liar and then blocked. Inspiration is fine and great, I've had people do that to mine, but word for word?  No different if somebody was copy/pasting your posts, either, I feel.  Yeah, no money is involved, but it still is not right, there is still a lot of work and emotions and one's self put into this, but that is my own opinion.",
