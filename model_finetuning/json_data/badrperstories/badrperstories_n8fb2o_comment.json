            "body": "Depending on how close I feel to a roleplaying partner who complains so much, I'd ask something along the lines of, \"Out of curiosity - if they're so bad/annoying/boring, then why are you still playing with them, then?\"\n\nAlthough the answer to that can be obvious - it feels to me like it's reliance to draw the lucky lottery ticket where the partner either matches her preferences *perfectly*, in which case she'll ditch everyone and everything to play with *them*, or maybe the perfect match was already drawn, and it's just a matter of killing time until they show up. Or find a Jedi master who can read minds through the internets.\n\nBut it can be something else, of course - while you *might* be wondering if she isn't doing the same about you (as others have suggested so far), it *can* be that she's not doing it, and is actually sharing such stuff just with *you.* I don't have RP partners who do this sort of complaining often, just occasionally - and with those, it's people who I feel equal to me in writing *and* I know they're interested in it, due to always approaching me if they spot me around. So it can be that the sharing comes out of a place of... \"*You're as good as me (or better) at RP, you will understand what I'm complaining about. Right?\"*\n\nOr it can be just a case of superiority complex where she just needs to feel better than anyone else. Text communication is hard to interpret like that.\n\nI'd say, the most important thing to ask yourself is this: do you feel like you're walking on eggshells when you're writing your replies back to her? Because I've felt that, too, and it's a *bad* feeling. I don't care if it'd be a red flag or a green flag, the important thing is to have *fun* while writing. You can't have fun when you're constantly doubting yourself with every post you make. It's just not worth it.",

It's saying \"look at this awful thing they did, let's vent and laugh about it together\" with the intention of making you trust her because she shared this with you. In trusting her, you're less likely to abandon your story with her.\n\nWhile generally manipulation is a red flag, the reason I say this is more pinkish is that she clearly isn't leaving any of these allegedly awful other stories. She's just venting to vent because she has shit-tier communication skills. If she's still giving you content that you like though, you know she's not leaving because she's trying to make sure you don't, so if you're happy - maybe just look the other way. If, however, you need your partner to be mature and direct with their communication, then yeah, red flag. Bippity boppity bounce.",
