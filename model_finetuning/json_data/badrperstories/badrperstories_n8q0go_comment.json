            "body": "**Worst Writing Partner**:   \nAt first, I thought he was the most amazing writer I'd ever seen. He was full purple prose, novella, one of those who really felt like he needed to flex to establish dominance, so he flexed in every post. I couldn't even get close to keeping up with him, until I actually took the dazed goggles off to dissect the content of his posts. Then I realized it was two full pages each time of straight fluff. The reason I was having such a hard time responding to him was that less than 5% of those two pages was actual content I could respond to. The rest was either introspection which my very-much-not-a-psychic-character couldn't know or it was some random anecdotal memory that wasn't altogether relevant so he could flesh out his character more. Which meant it was on me, every single time, to drive the scene forward. No wonder I was exhausted, I was pulling two pages out of my ass of actionable content while he was giving me fluff just to be able to \"beat\" me.   \n\n\nBut the reason he's the absolute worst writing partner I've ever had is the boundaries he crossed. I told him up front that I did not like writing smut with people I didn't know, which was him. I intentionally made a character in a position where her \"owners\" were entirely NPC so no PCs in the server could touch her (this was a group game). He made a character that was her owner's son, who therefore had access to her. He assured me he wasn't going to try anything, then beelined right for her in the first scene. After that, I agreed to keep it going but made sure he understood I *do NOT write smut*. After speeding through the server's lore steps to get into bed with my character, we faded the scene to black. I started prepping for my next scene. He opened a DM with his first post for them to hook up. I messaged to say again that I don't write smut. He asked me to \"just try it\" I said no, he kept pushing and then started writing the scene for me in a way that was metagaming to fuck and back and leaving my character getting folded like a pretzel and generally played not how she would be played if I was writing her. He threatened to submit it to canon if I didn't at least try and since he was an Admin of the server, I eventually agreed. We got through it and then he had his characters \"other personality\" wake up to violently r@pe my character before trying to leave her on the balcony and play his character's guards taking turns. He then DM'd me to ask if I was \"hot\" following it up with \"I'm so hard right now.\" I left, and he followed me into my main server. There, he spent about a month posturing to my players as if he was an Admin there too and trying to get me to link my character with his while also telling another Mod of mine he wanted the same with her character. When we found out, we stopped writing with him and casually edged him out of the plot until he left on his own. He came back once or twice, but that bridge was burned to a crisp.   \n\n\n**Best Writing Partner**:  \n I found him on Elliquiy about 2.5 years ago. Amusingly, I didn't like him very much because he had gotten spun around by the guy in the above story. The Worst guy manipulated the Best one into making a completely lore-breaking character, and for a while I thought that was intentional, so I wouldn't give Best the time of day. It happened to be that I found a random server to just have a little vacation place, and I plugged it into my server. He was the only one from mine that joined it. I wasn't expecting to enjoy writing with him because up until then I thought he was kind of an ass. Our characters did end up getting together though, and there was this one scene where they were hiding from cannibals in a closet. His character was keeping mine quiet. The way Best described his character, I was put RIGHT into the scene. I have never in my life had that kind of description. In one paragraph, I was THERE. That was the moment I knew he was a whole other ballpark.  \n\n\n In my main server, we ended up pairing our characters too. We've been writing together since. It's been a lot of ups and downs, I mean, when your relationship is rooted in a hobby that's so passioned-based, there's bound to be fights. But to this day, no one inspires me the way he and his writing do. I have never in my life been able to write the way I can when I'm writing with him or about one of his characters. He just pulls it all out of me, and he did even before we took things OOC. I used to consider myself a very good writer. I realize now that while I wasn't as fluffy a writer as Worst was, I still gave mostly fluff. Best, however, showed me how to put people into my scenes. He's made me a better writer just for knowing him. No matter what happens, that's a skill I can take with me anywhere. The downside is that he's raised my standards so much, I won't even try to find other writing partners. If something happened to him, I'd probably quit. There's no one whose muse will ever match that.",

            "body": "About the worst partner? Sure thing buddy, sit back and listen to this utter Mc'fuckery: \n\nWhen I was about, say 14, I think? I used to RP in ye olde MSN public chat rooms. There was one chatroom that was called something like the Red Tavern Inn where people would just generally RP medieval type characters in a medieval type tavern setting. It was super fun. Often times, friendships were established in these public chat RPs. Once you found a consistent RP partner in those chats, you shared your MSN messenger email/screen name info with them, so now the two of you could chat and RP exclusively together over MSN messenger. \n\nSo I met this dude in this public MSN chat and we did some fun little RPs together, then added each other on MSN messenger. I RP'd and chatted with this dude for the next couple of years, but it was only about a month or so in that he started asking me to send him a picture of myself. Remember, now, I am 14 mf years old. But this goes on for the next couple of years. Every so often, this guy would ask me for a picture of myself and I would never send him any. Because it was feckin' creepy and back in those days, you always heard warnings to *never* send a stranger your photo on the Internet (b/c they'll put your face in a porn photo!!!1!). I never gave this dude my photo, but the next weirdass fuckin' thing he started to do was try to get my character pregnant in RP. In one RP, he wrote that my character woke up from an in-story blackout and suddenly *already had a fucking child*. Very Sleeping Beauty type of shit, I guess, but WOW did that piss me tf off. Granted, I think I was about 16 by this point? Anyway, I had my character abandon the baby like a soulless monster pfffff. \n\nAbout another year goes by, so I'm like... 17 now? And I find out this mf is like in his late goddamn 20s. Which was really fuckin' creepy but the icing on the cake was when I discovered that he was still RPing with other 14 year old girls and trying to ask them what their bra sizes were and trying to get them to send him photos of themself topless. Sooooooo yeaaaaaaah. I confronted him about this and told him that there was a word for that kind of behavior: \"pedophile\". He didn't respond much to that. After that, we lost contact and I haven't heard from him since. \n\n\n\n**So, my best RP partner, though? Good news, I have two!!**\n\nIn that very same MSN chatroom, I met another dude and we exchanged our MSN messenger info, too. He was actually two years younger than me, but we did plenty of fantasy style RPs together and chatted a lot throughout the years. We never had issues with ghosting or things like that because often times, we'd start an RP and then mutually get bored with it and then just start a new one with a different setting. We just bounced around in different RP scenarios whenever we felt like it. Plots were dropped left and right, but our momentum was pretty good. Over the years we RP'd together less and less but stayed friends and chatted. Now its been like 20 years later and I see this dude as like a little brother. A couple of years ago we finally met face to face and hung out. He has a girlfriend, owns a house. The dude's well on his way and I couldn't be more proud of him. \n\nThe other great RP partner I had was super polite and courteous but also really imaginative and a great writer. We worked pretty well together when feeling out who would write starters, when to skip to next scenes, when to fade to black. We RP'd together for a good couple years and our characters had awesome, amazingly strong relationships. Suffice it to say, though, I kind of bowed out of RP about two years ago because I've wanted to focus on other hobbies. But during that time, the RP was pretty good!",

Honestly it\u2019s my favorite roleplay and I\u2019m always excited whenever he answers because he helps make the roleplay exciting. Hopefully that all made sense lol",

His academic reimbursement check was late because he forgot to register. I sent finds down to cover him thinking he would repay me when the check came. Nothing was said so I confronted him. He explained his textbooks were more than he expected. One thing led to another. He was lazy getting a job and told me his clothes were all worn out. I sent him a wardrobe of clothing. He would periodically tell me he was having one-nighters on Recon or Grindr.  We argued and he would go undercover. I mean he went to bed and covered himself over. he is very engaging and personable. Each time he wormed his way back into my life until I had it. I had not kept a record so one day I totaled it up and said I was done with helping him buy drugs, visit friends and go to concerts while not working. He promised to repay me, then when I asked for a schedule he ghosted me.",

            "body": "Worst: This dude and I had been RPing together for maybe a month a combination of adventure, slice of life and ofc smut. Slowly, the last one was becoming more prominent. After an RP session of smut, he started asking me if I wanted to go on VC. When I declined, he started to insist a bit more but I gave an excuse that I was going to be doing something with my FC. He stopped for the time being till our next scheduled RP. Annnnd go figure, it was more smut. Midway through the RP, he again asked me if I wanted to go on VC. Warning bells started ringing in my head considering it was another session of smut that he initiated despite me trying to aim for a adventure. I declined and typed my response only for him to refuse to post unless I got in VC. I told him I wasn't comfortable with the idea and that just post when he can, I was going to do something else. He then proceeded to spam call me on discord. I ended up blocking him and leaving the shared discord. A few days later, I got a friend request from someone claiming to be a friend of the dude and was fishing for why I suddenly ended the RP. Ended up blocking them too. \n\nBest: Current partner and I have been RP partners for around 2-3 years now. We mesh very well, we're good friends OOC and our characters compliment each other. Ironically, when he messaged me I was a bit leery considering his character is a catte boi and in the game we play they're kinda known to be horny mfers. After a few days of RPing things were still good, no warning bells etc and been RPing together ever since.",

Whoa Boy-o-boy Do I have a story!\n\nAlso Trigger Warning.\n\nSo, To set the scene, It's a fantasy role play from Medieval times, My OC is a female mage, that can perform the basic elemental magic, with a high aptitude for these magics, but lower stats in everything else. I asked for a ref, he sent... a dragon with a monster cock, I'm like whoa Jamal, Can you calm down? He says that it's a fine ref, so I just, truck on and ignore it, so we start rping and I type a good 3 paragraphs with a beginning, middle and end, seven sentences. His first response to me is, \"Swoops down in Dragon form and slaps my dick on your face\". So again I say, Ey Bud, Calm down, and so he stops with the sexual, but still just one lines. When our characters finally meet up he says, \"Hey Miss Mage.. Your pretty Cute. \\*Proceeds to pounce on you and fuck you\\*\" I confront him again and he says that this is just how I do things and if you can't handle it then you can go get.. and I quote \"raped in an alleyway and thrown in the gutter.\" I left after that.\n\nTL;DR Dude tried to ERP then insulted me when I wasn't down for that.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nMy best is with my now girlfriend, we met on discord and had a nice, lengthy and passionate JOJO roleplay. I really enjoy it, and we have roleplayed irl. I really love her, and her rp style.",

            "body": "Ugh I had one where we stopped a rp with their character and they made an entirely new one. With the new rp I went ahead and gave it a chance but they just rushed EVERYTHING. I enjoy story and world building but they just kept rushing everything. One post the characters were meeting then the next response they forced a time jump and the characters getting married! I had to cut it off with them.\n\nNow a good one I'm currently still doing is amazing! They make sure to paint the picture with their posts and they have multiple sentences too! It's only been going for a month now but the story building snd the aspect of adventure is just amazing!",

            "body": "The worst? I can't really tell. There were several people who were horrible but for ooc reasons so I'll have to go with that one guy, C, who I met in an mmorpg in high school. He was a year older, and seemed nice and friendly, but he quickly started driving the RP in smut direction. He also was kinda the textbook toxic RP partner who acted like a jealous spouse if I interacted with other people. Ironically, his actions led me to meet a couple good folks and be able to move on from him.\n\nThe best? I don't really think I had a good partner. \n\nI can say that one of the people I met because of C was quite good. We had several long RPs that spanned whole ass stories and he put up with my angsty characters. \n\nSadly we stopped talking cause he caught feelings ooc and I kinda turned him down and it got really awkward afterwards. I hope he's doing okay.\n\nI don't think I can return to that community because I don't think they'll accept my newfound gender identity and a lot of other things.",
