It's a bit like being on a first date or even just having met someone and having them ask you what you like in bed. My first response is \"who cares, we're not fucking. Ever.\" It's just incredibly presumptuous.   \n\n\nThey might be meaning to ask what your hard limits are and just wording it wrong, but if it's happening multiple times then that's unlikely. In terms of how to steer your ads against this though, I'd list my hard limits just to be on the safe side if that is what they're asking for, and then if people keep asking, just don't respond.",
