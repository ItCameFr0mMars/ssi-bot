Roleplay is a collaborative hobby and these all sound like people who aren't actually all that collaborative. I always feel like if people have this sort of reaction to small things then perhaps they should go write fiction by themselves instead of hoping someone will just go along with whatever they say. \n\nI'm sorry you had to deal with people like this but it's safe to say you dodged a handful of bullets. \n\nI do think that there is a right/wrong way to go about critiquing or bringing up issues in the Roleplay and I will say that making a joke about it can come off as passive aggressive sometimes. I find that just being kind, honest, and direct is the best approach to take because sometimes an unintended consequence of just making a joke about it is making the other person feel like you are judging/making fun of them.",

Surely if someone wants to create a long-term partnership with someone who will put effort into a project, they'll realize ahead of time that they'll have to compromise at some point? If it's vitally important that a plot or character remain completely 100% unchanged, then why try to find someone who will be your yes-man NPC instead of writing it alone? \n\nI've been pretty fortunate with this, I think, because nine times out of ten a person will do that during plotting and I've only lost a few hours of my time. But it's always disappointing to think that you've found a good partner only for them to *my way or no way* you. Especially if they act like you're the inflexible one for setting a boundary or not wanting to do something you won't enjoy!",

But, aside from that, some people aren\u2019t used to receiving criticism. I remember when I got my first real criticism (after I asked a friend to give me it as I wanted to improve and was horribly stuck). And even though I asked it of her, I still went and cried in the bathroom for a few minutes. She wasn\u2019t mean about it or anything and what she said did help me get better. So I guess it\u2019s also about mindset AND how the other person processes it? And maybe motivation has a big part to play in it too (like how motivated they are to put that much effort into correcting the plot/character/etc)? There\u2019s just a lot of variables when it comes to why. It\u2019s kinda like a rabbit hole, so the frustration/annoyance is understandable.\n\nI know I have some issues being honest with newer RP partners, and that\u2019s because how my previous attempts at honesty with others didn\u2019t end well. One time the person basically said that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have to respect my boundaries\u201d because we were \u201cfriends\u201d and that I \u201cshould be ashamed to even imply\u201d they \u201ccould make me feel that way.\u201d It still hurts to this day and makes me so anxious being honest about the smallest things.\n\nBUT at least you found out you weren\u2019t compatible with those people before you spent too long RPing with them (or so I hope)? Some people just aren\u2019t compatible with each other. Some aren\u2019t as dedicated/etc to RP as others and some just want some weird fantasy written out/fulfilled. It\u2019s hard to weed those people out.\n\nStill, I want to encourage you to keep being honest. It\u2019s a really good quality to have. I\u2019m not sure how you phrase it but I\u2019ve found putting a question mark at the end of a strong sentence sometimes helps? Or you can try offering a solution to fix whatever the problem is (assuming that\u2019s possible)?",

            "body": "There's the other side of the coin to consider here, too.\n\nOnce I was told that I played my character too unrealistically and it was breaking the other RPer's suspension of disbelief. I took the criticism, of course - maintaining the suspension of disbelief is *crucial*, after all - and adjusted accordingly. The corrections were deemed adequate enough and we carried on.\n\nBut the RP fizzled out later anyway, why? It took some retrospect and analysis of my own posts to figure out the reason, which turned out to be that I ended up playing said character *too* passively, actions described too carefully, overall - too much concern about the other's suspension of disbelief made me feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them, and the entire RP suffered because of it.\n\nI realize this is entirely my problem and a flaw to work on, but wanted to share the different viewpoint regardless. Since RPs where I need to adjust my characters' behavior tend to fall flat anyway, I've decided to just not take criticism about them. I know how much this sounds like a \"my way or the highway\", but I like to think taking that stance saves both mine and another's time. That and the perception of realism varies from person to person, their knowledge and experience. Someone serving in the army who's also a history buff *and* a big fan of fantasy (I've RPed with such a person, it was a bit daunting to be honest) will have a *drastically* different idea of what a war between a civilized nation and a bunch of savages will look like, than someone who, say, just played a bunch of RPG games where the 'barbarian' class is intentionally balanced to be as viable/fun to play as as the 'paladin', for example.\n\nBoth RPers will absolutely have fun RPing it out, but I think it's best if they match up with someone closer to their knowledge (or lack of it) OOC.",
