            "body": "I think saying that you're open to talking would help a lot. I can't think of many times that a roleplay partner has explicitly said up front that they want open and honest communication. Usually I'm assessing their behaviour and guessing how likely they are to be willing to work with me on a problem instead of shutting down or blowing up. Five things come to mind that make me comfortable addressing problems with a writing partner. \n\n**Communication:** Always something that the rpc brings up, right? But in all seriousness, I feel a lot better about bringing up an issue if there's an established conversation. I'd rather have a history of chit-chat and character discussion, and positive interactions, instead of breaking weeks- or months-long silence to say I don't like something and want to change a plot/post. \n\n**Politeness:** Sure, text doesn't always translate tone well, and people can flip on a dime. But the person who displays respect and maturity in day-to-day chitchat is someone that I trust to handle serious issues with the same levelheadedness. If someone always complains about their other partners, makes crude jokes, uses a lot of caps/exclamation points, or just generally seems negative or aggressive, I'm gone long before any problems pop up. \n\n**Transparency:** They tell me that they like or don't like a certain thing. They bring up questions or concerns or ideas. It's not a guarantee that they can take what they give, but generally, someone who initiates this wants it to be a two-way street. \n\n**Options:** I've found that the more flexible someone is in plotting, the more they're likely to be flexible in posting. If someone's asking for my opinions and input in the beginning, it's not a guarantee that they're going to want to hear my thoughts later. But it's definitely more likely than someone who comes in with their mind made up on everything and tries to railroad me into doing everything just like they want it on day one. \n\n**Equal footing:** Someone who insists on their character being stronger and cooler than mine, or who godmods and metagames consistently, is not someone I trust to take even the gentlest critique or request. Once a player starts showing that main character syndrome, I'm a lot more reluctant to address things. That's not the kind of writer who's gonna go \"I'd love to talk about how to make this fun for you and won't take it as a deep personal insult the second you stop fawning over everything I do!\"",

Sometimes we're writing when we're tired, or ill, or having a bad mental health day, so mistakes of some kind are inevitable.\n\nSimilarly, if they respond to something with a wary question (\"So the krellox reproduce by budding asexually?\") I will try to respond in a way that makes it clear I'm flexible on the given point (\"that was my plan, but I'm not married to it, would you rather they had two sexes?\").",
