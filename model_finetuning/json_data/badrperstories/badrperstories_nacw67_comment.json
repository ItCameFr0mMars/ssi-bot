            "body": "It's exactly the sort of behaviour that made me weary of MMO RP. Quite often I noticed that a lot of role-players weren't actually team players and only ever really wanted to interact with one or two other members of their 'clique'. They'd always go through the process of recruiting new members but those individuals would be lucky to get more than an emote of acknowledgement in passing.  \n\n\nI spoke out against it on a number of occasions - especially when the group's leaders expressed puzzlement as to why they were struggling to retain the interest of new recruits. I couldn't get through to them, though - mostly due to gaslighting. It doesn't help that it's hard to prove but I've encountered a lot of players that mysteriously have to go AFK every few minutes when someone they're not familiar with is trying to interact with them but if one of their 'favourite' characters is around they'll sit down for hours with minimal or no absences at all.",

I remember I joined this one roleplay group that didn't end up doing anything. I asked the group leader when they were thinking of planning an event but their reply was just \"when we get more members.\" We never got more members, but we certainly had enough at the time to get *something* going. Anyway the group went silent within a month because the leader flat out refused to do anything with it.",
