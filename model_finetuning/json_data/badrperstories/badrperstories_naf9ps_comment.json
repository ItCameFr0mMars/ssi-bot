Like if something comes up or you just aren't feeling it, it takes 5 seconds to send a message explaining why. I know we are strangers and they owe me nothing but its literally good manners to let a person know you are going to leave. It doesn't even have to be a confrontational thing; send the message, leave, and then block if you feel like you must. During the planning stage I don't care if they just leave but once the rp actually starts... its a bit disheartening.",

TLDR; he went on and on and on about how terrible ghosting was and that he wasn't ever going to do that to anyone ever.\n\nFFW a couple months. I got really bored of the RP we were doing because it became something that was very strictly NSFW and honestly I was sick of writing blowjobs, sex and nothing else. I explained how I felt and asked if we could maybe brainstorm a new idea. He agreed, we discussed, made new characters, and started something new. \n\nAnd almost like clockwork I never heard from him again after I wrote the starting post to the new RP.",
