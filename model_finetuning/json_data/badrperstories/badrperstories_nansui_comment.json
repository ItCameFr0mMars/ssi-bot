Don't lie and claim you want something platonic, but advertise the gender pairing you want and the plot you want first and foremost without mentioning the rest.  The vast majority of rpers also want romance and/or eventual smut of some kind, so it will naturally come up during planning, but you'll get less of the really thirsty ones right out of the gate.",

My experience with RPNation was middling (they really, really don't want you to ask people to roleplay away from their forum and there are an uncomfortable number of underage players there for an old person like me).\n\nRoleplaying online is a bit like dating online.  You have to fire off a bunch of ads and queries to find the golden one or two solid contacts.  You have to tank some personal rejection in the service of finding the good ones.  And you have to develop a thicker skin to get to something worthwhile.\n\nI've been able to find partners to write with.  I've also had some silly ones, some mean ones, and some creepers, and occasionally I talk about them on here (which is how I got my current flair, I've had TWO rpers with characters walking on broken legs).  And then there are people that are perfectly fine, but you aren't really compatible, and I don't go into those here because they're not bad roleplayers.  These actually far outnumber the creeps and the mean ones, but they don't make for an interesting story!",
