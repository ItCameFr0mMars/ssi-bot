            "body": "Yeah, I agree with u/yesimmathrowaway \\-- ERPs in particular are kind of flash-the-pan, short-lived RPs where you may never hear from your partner again. Even if everything went well, I think just the nature of it makes it more \"disposable.\" Like Kleenex! Folks are just looking to play out a certain fantasy, and when that's done, they move on -- either to another fantasy, or a new partner. I wouldn't take it too personally. It probably isn't. \n\nBesides, RP, like anything else, takes practice, so I suppose you could look at these short-lived ERPs as an opportunity for more practice, with a range of partners. I sometimes feel like there's a vast divide between the ERPs and those looking for long-term partners. It's *hard* to find long-term partners that you vibe well with, who match your preferences and tastes, and have a similar/complementary writing style. Perhaps short-term one-offs could be a better way of finding such potential partners, but everyone assumes such scenes are just about the hawt sexin' (and maybe they are), but they don't *have* to be. Just playing out a simple scenario or scene could be an easier way to find out if you mesh well with someone, and if so, maybe *then* you move on to more complex plots &amp; storylines.\n\nAnyway, don't lose heart. It happens. A lot! Just part of the deal.",
