I hate confrontation and was already chainsmoking to calm my nerves, so I didn't really feel like dealing with him and just deleted him. We were friends before but there wasn't really any salvaging it beyond that. I even attempt once but he was still being fucking weird.\n\nSince August, it has been a weekly barrage of him trying to re-add me on stuff. If I block him, he just makes new accounts. So I just let the requests sit there and fester. It's very exhausting. Thankfully recently I haven't seen anything from him in like a month, which has felt like a vacation.",

His response was to try to join the site twice and then harass me on multiple platforms with multiple accounts when he was banned and blocked. \n\nI answered a buddy request on a forum and we exchanged Discord handles. Dude chain-messaged me and repeatedly asked for things I had already said I wouldn't do. To condense the next few hours - he set off just about every red flag I had. I said I wasn't going to write with him and didn't want him to join my site (he'd asked if I was writing on any and I linked him, before he started getting crazy). He asked why and I outlined everything he'd done that I found unacceptable including direct quotes from his messages. \n\nInstead of saying okay and leaving, he joined the server for the site I was staffing. He was removed with a DM saying, in so many words, \"I told you I didn't want you on my site and wouldn't write with you, don't come back\". His response to this was to join again, break several rules, and start spam-tagging members. Which is always behaviour you want to see from someone who joined a site after you said as staff that they weren't welcome there. \n\nAnyway, dude gets banned from the server and site, and immediately flips out in my DMs. I remove him as a friend. He spams me with friend requests. He gets no response whatsoever. He then goes back to the forum I originally found his buddy request on and tells me that I'm a toxic roleplayer and I don't deserve to staff if I kick people for no warning and with no reason. Remember how I explicitly told him not to join my site twice, *after* giving him a detailed list of what he'd done to make me want nothing to do with him? \n\nNo idea how that was a mystery for him. \n\nAfter getting blocked on Discord and several forums, he started harassing me on Discord with half a dozen alts over the next week and a half. Because it's totally innocuous to say hello and then ask if I've had any drama with my site lately and whether I'm the only staffer who decides whether to ban someone \ud83d\ude44 \n\nI ended up disabling the site server's invite link and not accepting any friend requests or DMs from strangers for the next month. It seemed like that was enough to scare him off, because when I reopened the server to new members and started accepting requests again, he was nowhere to be seen. I was lucky enough that the bulk of the story was over in a few hours - dude revealed his true colours fast - but following up on alts was what really made the whole deal annoying.",

            "body": "Twice.\n\nThe first time was technically my fault, since I was young and stupid and back then I gave people my real name and other key details freely. Someone took advantage of that and decided to contact a family member after we had a disagreement over RP and went on a self-righteous rant about how my character had betrayed her own but framing it as though I was the character in question.\n\nThat wasn't fun to explain to my parents at the time, though once they understood we came to look back and laugh it off.\n\nThe second time was a year or so back. Similar circumstances, really, except my online profile has been rightfully a lot more private and subtle so I can't be easily tracked these days. It happened in FFXIV. The leader of our little group of role-players vanished abruptly with no warning along with a handful of her helpers. The regular members, myself included, had no idea where they had all gone and assumed that they had simply quit the game. Some people left to find a more active group. I decided to stick it out with a handful of other players in the hope the leadership returned.\n\nIn their absence, I stepped up and ran some events to keep the people who stayed and logged on entertained. It proved popular. I later learned that the leadership had not actually quit so much as decided to just go and play another MMO together, without telling the people they were supposed to be leading.\n\nAn important point, since mysteriously right around the same time I began getting a reputation as a good event leader, they all returned to the game.\n\nOur system of leadership was meant to be based on voting. If a certain number of regular members spoke up to suggest someone as an officer, then that individual would be considered for promotion. \n\nMy name was put forward, though abruptly the system was put on hold - the official reasoning was that the leader and officers in the guild wished to regain their footing. I took it at face value but in hindsight it should have been a red flag.\n\nRegular members wished for me to continue running events, so I did as much - but then the leadership began organising their own and 'forgot' when mine were scheduled so there would be competing events. They'd pressure people to join theirs instead of mine, or show up to mine partway through and have a character be gravely injured to throw it off course.\n\nIt was around that point that I decided to leave. A few others followed me and I was blamed for 'stealing' group members. Being burned out on role-play in general, I retired from it not long afterwards. I even decided, along with a handful of close friends, to pay to transfer to a different server to get away from all the drama and gossip.\n\nOf course, that wasn't enough - I'd occasionally receive messages from low level characters who continued to blame me for 'stealing' people from the group. Including my partner who was never even in that group in the first place. This carried on for a while, though thankfully after reporting the issue the player responsible was banned. Or at least warned - either way, the messages stopped.\n\nIt pretty much served as the final straw to get me to step away from MMO based role-play for the most part, though. I no longer run events - it's too exhausting, often needlessly dramatic and there's far too many egos to dance around.",
