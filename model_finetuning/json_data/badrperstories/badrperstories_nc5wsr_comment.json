(i bet if that was public info, hardly anyone would play a vampire character.)\n\ni agree with you that it sounds like she made it up for you specifically, especially since she told you not to mention it in the chat. does she play male characters? i wonder if she was worried about her characters being overshadowed/not getting enough attention.",

Literally nothing made me think that vampires are not capable of having sex, and the mod herself also did write Smut scenes in other roleplays, as far as I know. This wasn't one of the roleplays were even thinking about sex scenes was absurd because of plot and setting.\n\nYeah, she wrote male characters, but I don't think that this was the reason. She always seemed to have a very specific image of my characters, their actions and thoughts in mind, and when something did not match her vision, she tried to justify it in her replies. Like interpreting some clearly rude actions of one of my characters in a positive light and acting like this really was his motiviation, trying to give my characters redemptions arcs after three replies, and so on...\nMaybe she just told me that I should not mention it because she knew some people would leave, but I am pretty sure she just made that information up for whatever reason, because it wasn't mentioned anywhere. She seemed to think it was a cool idea, and also told me how that is relevant for her characters.",

            "body": "\"What I say it is is how it's going to be, don't question me!\" &lt;-- I hate this sort of attitude with a passion and while it has thankfully never happened to me before, I'd cut ties with a RPer if it ever does. Even if it's a supernatural RP, it still needs to be bound by rules of logic that are clear and understood by all. Justification of every detail is what makes or breaks a play.\n\nSince this happened a while ago, we can only guess about her rationale at this point. My only theory is that she thinks of vampires as undead, and through playing a little game of associations we can also think about reanimated skeletons and zombies, which are types of undead that we don't usually associate with 'sexy times', or 'romance' for that matter. So I *guess* she played said game of associations, found vampires too comparable to zombies and felt the very idea of it was so repulsive that she didn't even want to talk about it. Not that it excuses her any.\n\nI need to say that to me, the idea of completely asexual vampires, unless they're of completely alien make (like in The Strain), is too strange to me. The vampire myths of old require a vampire to be *invited* into a home. I don't see a reason why it can't be done through seduction, in fact vamps (that and other malignant spirits) are *often* portrayed as being just that - seductive, tempting.",

Even if the server is down on ERP, I'm pretty sure romance makes up, like 80% or so of most plots, and one usually leads to the other. \n\nPlus, having this rule in place and not *telling* anyone seems ridiculous. Vampires, according to *most* lore (minus Anne Rice) are known for being sexy, seductive, etc, so that kinda goes against the norm of what most folks might expect and why they might be drawn to playing those characters in the first place. I suppose she could alienate a bunch of players if she made it more obvious. \n\nBut I guess that judgmental line about how if you \"only wanna join this roleplay to fool around\" says it all.

Probably because of the undead thing like you described. \n\n But the way she acted was also super condescending, which was one of the reason I left the roleplay. The whole roleplay was somewhat medieval (it was on an island that could only be reached by ship and there were only certain people allowed to visit it), and she told me that the common folk therefore had basically no electricity and did not know what smartphones are, only some of the royal characters had more modern stuff.\n\nUntil she allowed her favourite writer to let her character have an electronic piano, and sing 'Evacuate the dancefloor' by Cascada during a formal ball, and suddenly, everything had electricity and even the most sheltered peasant knew what smartphones etc. were, and I was stupid for even daring to ask how that fit into the rest of her worldbuilding.",

            "body": "That attitude toward world building triggered my flight or flight response and now my bones are displeased.\n\nGotta break out my keyboard for this one.\n\nThat response and attitude was absolute trash and she should be ashamed to be a moderator of an RP group if she fails to comprehend such basic grammar and can't deal with character creation requests like an adult? So how do we go about reconciling her desires with the character idea?\n\nAsexual vampires. Okay, neat idea, I see where it might be coming from, but EVEN ASEXUAL HUMANS WILL STILL HAVE SEX FOR VARIOUS REASONS, so that's a stupid assertion with how she presented it, but let's roll with it anyway.\n\nLet's say; vampires are undead beings preserved by some sort of magic and able to regenerate based on blood consumption and age, but have no internal organ functions in terms of lungs, GI tract or sexual organs because they are unnecessary to the vampire species. The brain functions by sheer force of will, allowing them thought, but the curse enhances their survival instincts, and because they require blood to regenerate when harmed, they're naturally more compelled to the hunt and feast than anything else.\n\nOkay, there's that. Neat.\n\nBecause they're undead, though, and lack \"unnecessary\" organ function, they also don't have active nerve endings, thus they physically cannot feel, be it pain, pleasure, or temperature; the sensation of hunger is a mental attribute given by the curse to ensure feeding, but physical hunger is not detected. This is why they are immune to climate and can tank damage, but also means they are not likely to notice when they get hurt accidentally and cannot feel pleasure. Give and take.\n\nBecause of these factors, vampires cannot feel sexual urges and are unable to get physically aroused, as they simply lack the ability to do so at all because penis needs blood and all that, which doesn't pump in their veins, and they do not respond to stimuli such as stroking or grinding.\n\nThere's a plausible reason why they don't feel the urges. Their bodies are no longer programmed for breeding: they spawn through bites or blood, the organs are dead and the hormones are not being produced by the brain.\n\nDoes this eliminate the possibility of sex?\n\nNO.\n\nClaiming they are undead implies they were once alive and human at some point, and depending on how they lived, unless the turning from human to vampire gives them amnesia, they likely REMEMBER how to sex and please, so they can easily compensate for the lack of direct arousal. They don't have to be turned on or motivated by The Big Horny to engage--maybe they keep their posse enthralled with a good time so they have a steady supply of blood, or they use it to mask their vampiric nature around humans, or god knows what.\n\nBecoming a vampire doesn't mean you instantly forget how to give fellatio or fake it for an end goal so any of them with previous experience can grab some lube or strap on a floppy and mime their way through the event. Hell, maybe some even do it just to feel a tiny bit more human again! They may not get off on it themselves, but if their end goal is to keep a blood bucket on demand or blackmail someone or just enjoy the intimacy beyond the sex, they don't have to be horny to do it.\n\nUsing that context, they can still be asexual beings that lack the standard Horny Mode some humans come with, but you can still build a reasonable \"ladies man\" type character out of it without breaking that rule.\n\nHer arguments are dumb but at least my bones are no longer displeased by her transgressions against world building.",
