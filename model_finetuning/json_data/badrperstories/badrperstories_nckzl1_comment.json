            "body": "I guess there are multiple reasons:\n\n\\-some people, like the person I know, want to make their life appear more interesting than it is is by adding a partner or cool siblings. They create this very elaborate narrative, not with the main goal to harm anyone, but with the intention that people find them more interesting. This regularly backfires, because most of them pair this narrative with other lies (in an anime forum they will act like they are half-japanese or speak fluent  japanese, or as if they are great artists but they really just take other people's art and present them as their own). These lies then make people suspicious, and people stop interacting with them.\n\n\\-it is so easy to emotionally manipulate someone when you have another account that can be like 'Hey, Nachtreiher hasn't been home the whole night:( I am so worried'. People will be super worried but also assume that you have already done everything you could, and you can easily just say that you already informed the authorities. When you don't have the fake account, you can only say 'Hey, I run away today' but people already know you are safe and will probably just wonder why the hell you are telling them this. This is why some people go the 'I want to harm/kill myself'-route to emotionally manipulate someone online, but that is far more tricky, because someone could call the police that they are suicidal and demand a wellness check. \n\n\\-You have had an argument with you favourite writing partner and they want nothing more to do with you? The whole forums knows that you are kind of an asshole? Worry not, you can just take the fake partner/sibling account and still interact with everyone like you normally do. If they ask you what the hell your other fake-account did, just stay neutral and say you don't want to take part in that drama because the person involved is your partner (and you know they did not mean it that way, they are going through a rough time) or your sibling and you don't want to talk bad about them.\n\n\\-some people are obsessed with the thought of other people badmouthing them, and they want a way to ensure everyone talks nice about them. \n\n\\-it is super hard to proof that they are the same person, even if they have the same writing style. If they allegedly live together, it is even normal that their IP-adress will be the same. If someone says 'proof it to me by being online at the same time', you can just use your mobile phone for one and the laptop for the other account or ask a friend to help you out. And roleplaying forums are very anonymous, which is good, but therefore you can also not tell them to send a photo of them as a proof, because many people do not want to share personal info and saying 'They did not want to show me a photo/videocall, that proves they are fake' will make other people think that you are the weird one. Therefore many people just start avoiding them altogether when they get suspicious.\n\nI think most of the time, it is a combination of all of these things. If you get found out, you just disappear, maybe come back later with a new identity.",
