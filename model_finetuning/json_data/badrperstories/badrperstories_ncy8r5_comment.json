If she hasn\u2019t interacted again I feel like your stance has gotten through, some RPers can be a little more stubborn about that sort of thing. Usually though when I run into similar scenarios I talk OOC to the other RPer and tell them that they\u2019re flirting or whatever isn\u2019t going to work and such to see if they\u2019re solely trying to get ERP or they just have a flirty character that\u2019s never been rejected and they do want to get some character development from a rejection. You can usually tell which is which by the OOC reaction tbh. \n\nGranted this definitely isn\u2019t me suggesting you go out of your way OOC to talk to her. I think the lack of interaction is a sign your message did reach in the end.",
