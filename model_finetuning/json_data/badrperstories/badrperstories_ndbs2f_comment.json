Normal people wouldn't even think of pulling that kind of shit. \n\nWhy not find places to roleplay that don't have a combat focus, if you have a hard time with fighting roleplays? There's a lot of slice-of-life servers and sites out there. Or even just other combat roleplays where people have basic etiquette and don't murderhobo through your character roster for kicks.",

            "body": "I feel like it's a general rule of thumb that if you're doing something to another person's character you ask them, work out what you'd like to accomplish, and make sure they're okay with it? Like it's horrible etiquette to dictate the actions or experiences of another character. Even as a GM I would never just kill or maim a character without discussing it with them first? \n\nYou may indeed need to learn to stick up for yourself but you should also learn that your creative characters deserve to have the same experiences and fun as anyone elses, and nobody's character is better or entitled to being an all out joy-kill because they're on a powertrip. RP is COOPERATIVE. Don't beat yourself up so much, you're allowed to have fun and not have your characters abused or even killed! How would they like it if you did the same to them? \n\nOn the other hand don't be afraid to engage and try to react back. If someone is strangling you, why not take a step back and ask why, what do they hope to gain or demonstrate with this? I'm a firm believer that RP actions by characters should be done with intent to reveal more about their character. They should have motivation and a scene should establish something about them, their history, a relationship, etc. Try to remember that when you get nervous about reacting. You can add to that character's experience beyond doing nothing and dying. But at the same time don't let people put you into situations that you don't enjoy or that make you uncomfortable.",

Idk if it is one character that gets resurrected or multiple ones being created\u2026 But the reason still stands the same. You're not having fun being playing the Krillin of the server, and that is perfectly normal.\n\nYou are surely entitled to react to someone else's attacks. \n\nAnd also remember that a fight can end in many other ways than just by one side being completely obliterated.\nOne could be captured, as you already stated injured to the point of not being able to fight anymore, people could reason that the fight is simply being pointless and so ally with the other side, otherwise simply flee.\n\nThese are one of the few options I like to use when GMing, and I find it way more interesting rather than just kill off PC's from the board and kick my players back to square one and make another character.\n\nI hope these suggestions are going to inspire you and give you more hope to continue your road of roleplaying!",

So even if you did it sounds like the mod would've been an idiot and would've extinction burst hard at 'guys c'mon'.\n\n&gt;But I'm just not that good at fighting roleplays. So THAT'S why I'm often killed off for fun.\n\nNah, people that kill off for fun like that are fucking obnoxious.  A good Rper won't take advantage of someones' struggle and will talk about it beforehand.  They didn't wantonly kill off each others' characters so they were just taking advantage at that point.",

Same story, they target people who are lacking in fight knowledge~movement, have flaws, weaker, and hold back. But this means you\u2019ll need to build more self respect for yourself. Be sorry for yourself now but promise yourself you\u2019ll leave from those servers ASAP. Nothing Is worse becoming the server\u2019s training dummy..\n\nAlso, I saw another comment from you that the server died out. My story also had the server I was in died out too...huh.",
