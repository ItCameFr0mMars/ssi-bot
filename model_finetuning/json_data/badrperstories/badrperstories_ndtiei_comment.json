            "body": "I think that they might be the person who quickly needs something new in general. \n\n\\-I understand stopping a roleplay for personal reasons, but I wonder why she did not want to pick the old roleplay up again when she came back. Five weeks isn't such a long time.\n\n\\-she probably wasn't so much into the second idea from the beginning, as you also noticed that the chemistry in that roleplay was a bit lacking. That it wasn't interesting enough and too slow for her might point to a deeper roleplaying preference of hers, she might always need a lot of new ideas and drama to keep a roleplay going. Not many people can keep up with that, and in my experience people like that are always quick to end a roleplay. They are super hyped in the beginning, and boom, then they are gone. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't think it was necessarily something you did. For me, she seems like the type that is most intrigued by new roleplays, when the ideas are still fresh and exciting, and then often looses the ambition to keep going altogether. I met many people like that, who often told me (and many of the other people they wrote with) how much they loved the roleplay, and after writing about 15 replies, it was deleted or they never replied again. They came back to start a new roleplay with me, I give them the benefit of the doubt, the same thing happens after a short while.\n\nShe probably thought: 'I can't tell gemingapulsar I am leaving/not interested again, they could feel cheated because I already did that once and might insult me.' Especially after you accepted that they came back, many people don't want to admit that it does not work out again for whatever reason, and therefore just ghost to avoid the confrontation.",
