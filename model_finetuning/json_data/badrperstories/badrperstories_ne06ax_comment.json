            "body": "i don't know that this is a misogyny problem, because i'll bet these guys would do the absolute same thing if there was another male character in the group. when it comes to fantasy rp there's often a heavy emphasis on magic and brute abilities and unfortunately it tends to attract the kind of rper looking for a power... well, fantasy. it is not only male role players who do this, but it does seem at least a little more likely with them. in particular younger men.\n\nit doesn't mean you have to sit down &amp; take it, though. you should absolutely point out things like, 'hey, my character has been training in xyz her entire life and your character just tried it for the first time and was comparable to her ability. do you think we can tone that down? i'd like our characters to complement each other, and that doesn't happen if yours is the best at everything.'\n\nalso advertise seeking players who don't mind playing the underdog. players who aren't afraid to let their characters be bad at something &amp; make mistakes. if you're 18+ or 20+ i would also strongly suggest looking for older players, because you see a little less of this kind of thing with more mature and experienced writers.\n\nyour frustration makes a ton of sense &amp; i hope you find someone fun to write with soon!",

More mature roleplayers are probably less prone to do this. Basically, I'd say it maybe has more to do with the age &amp; gender of your partners than it does the genre. That being said, the guys who are into fantasy may be more drawn to the Conan or Witcher archetypes, who are always the best at what they do. That's the fantasy they may want to play out, as well.\n\nI know the above is a lot of over-generalizing. But I play fantasy storylines all the time and I haven't really encountered this, but my partners are more often middle-aged women like myself, so we just focus on different things.\n\n(Edited because I made assumptions about the OP's gender).",

But the groups I used to hang out with weren't that great in general. \n\nIn 1x1, I think it's more that every RP genre attracts certain people looking for a specific sort of wish fulfillment.  Fantasy attracts a lot of people who want to play out being a big strong hero who protects the damsel.  And that's fine in itself, but it's a problem when they try to apply it to people who clearly aren't into it.\n\nThe only thing you can really do is be very clear on your ads about what you want and to learn how to spot the warning signs of someone who might try to do this.",
