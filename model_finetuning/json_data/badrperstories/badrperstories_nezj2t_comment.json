            "body": "1. I think the only thing you might have been guilty of was not taking the hint that the person wasn't interested sooner, but  that's not your fault.  It's still on them.  I have a feeling that their \"friend\" was them and they were projecting onto you since you didn't ghost and weren't constantly asking.  So, not you here.\n2. I'm a little confused. Were you pretending to be Sherlock's player OOC?  Because that can come off as very sketchy.  I can see why they wouldn't want to write with you after you pretended to be someone else, especially knowing they have trust issues.  It's not that you didn't say that was the problem (though it didn't help).  It's that you lied in the first place (even if it was 100% supposed to be a joke and even if others enjoyed it.)  It was just sort of an insensitive prank on someone with trust issues so I'd consider that your own fault.  Just learn from it and you're golden.\n\nHOWEVER, If your character was pretending to be Sherlock IC then that person overreacted OOC and it's not your fault.\n\nI will say that it does sound like there might be some  IC/OOC boundary crossing going on with this one too so that may be why it turned into such a mess.\n\n3) Totally not your fault.  They were not interested anymore and couldn't admit it.  It might be to spare your feelings.  It might be because they were hoping to get inspired to write again.  In the end, that part doesn't matter because they clearly weren't going to write.  I will say that if it's been a month, you should probably just assume that they're not interested and start looking for something else.  If they do come back, that's great, but trust your gut when it tells you something's up.\n\nOverall, I don't think you fall into the bad rper category.",
