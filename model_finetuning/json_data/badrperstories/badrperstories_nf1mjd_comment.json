But sometimes in DMs she'd start saying things, like telling me to \"bend over\" and calling me \"easy,\" or would be like \"-lays my head on your boobs.-\" And whenever I reacted awkwardly she'd just say she's joking. It's not cute.\n\nAnd... I know you say he's a friend of yours, but if someone gets *mad* at you for being uncomfortable about sexual things being said to you, that's not okay. If you ask him to stop, tell him you don't like it, and he does it anyway, he's ignoring your boundaries and it's creepy. Have you specifically told him you're okay with it in rp but not in DMs?

No one will accept that when they eyes turn away there's horror left behind.\n\nMaybe he is nice. Maybe he's generally a decent person for everything except this one thing.\n\nBut that does not make it alright to do. And I'm willing to bet he's banking on people believing in his good guy facade, because even you accept he is \"good\" meaning it is that much easier for him to twist your perception that his creepy actions aren't bad. Because he's \"good\".\n\nGrooming. Gas lighting. Manipulation.\n\nHe needs called out, blocked, and reported, with evidence of boundaries being crossed, and if they choose to believe him over you then they're a lost cause and you need to leave that situation. You do not owe anyone your loyalty, they deserve none of your second thoughts.\n\nDo not subject yourself to his attitude. Teach him the hard way what happens when you're a creep. Let others learn the hard way too so they can open their eyes and run later, if they wouldn't read the writing you left on the wall.\n\nBe safe.",
