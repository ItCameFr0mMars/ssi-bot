That happens often when people are too hyped.\n\n\\-communication issues. A lot of people just don't voice that there is something wrong with the roleplay, and although their partner thinks everything is going perfectly well, their issues with the roleplay become more and more apparent (because they never mentioned them and therefore they can't be solved), so they just leave one day.\n\n\\-Especially when you move forward fast and write daily in the roleplay, people can sometimes be hesistant to write again when they had to leave a while because of real-life problems, because they feel that their partner will be too disappointed that they left so suddenly anyway.",

That person ended up doing *exactly* what I had been worried about, and they were cold about it when it happened. As far as I know they are *still* out there telling lies about me, I think because they refuse to accept that things went sour because of their choices.\n\nI've also made a few people sad when I would decline to start a roleplay because *I* didn't think I could give the roleplay and the roleplayer the focus and time they'd deserve since my roleplaying energies were already invested elsewhere, but I think it's important to know your limit and to not exceed it. Sometimes grabbing the new shiny is harmful.\n\nIt's funny to apply this to roleplay, but *'the grass is greener where you water it'*. Some people can't help but want to grab every new shiny thing/not say no to anyone, and they end up running out of 'water', and then they either feel terrible about it and have a tangle of people and hurt feelings to deal with, or they just coldly drop the stuff that they got the initial rush from and move forward grabbing new things that still have the new shine and never think to try and stop just reaching for new roleplay after new roleplay.",

Nobody messaged me, so I haven't really bothered to continue or message them except for the one person who came back right before I was going on hiatus. I've completely lost interest in writing and it sucks. \n\nNot everyone that ghosts is like this or this severe, but having motivation be killed isn't as uncommon as you think.
