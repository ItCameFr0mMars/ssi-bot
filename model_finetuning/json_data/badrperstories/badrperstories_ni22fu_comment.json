Now they do sound kind of annoying, but I don't think this person is malicious, they just think you're enjoying it as well. Their \"weird\" ask about the TV show was probably an attempt to connect with you as friends.\n\nYou need to be clear and tell them that they are bothering you. Honestly they don't seem like the type to really take feedback well, but. It sounds like you are just sitting there steaming about it privately to yourself.",

I know they have no ill will, which is why I haven't actually blocked them yet. It's just every time I say no, they come back literally an hour later asking again. \nLast interaction was from an RP. Sent my response an hour ago, currently no response despite the fact they're online, I seem to be being ghosted. Again. Last time I did give feedback, I was like \"No offense, but I don't want to RP all the time.\", then they came back with something like \"You just don't like me\".

            "body": "Yeah, to elaborate further on this, latest interaction this weekend: They asked if I watch a certain YT channel, I tell them no, they ask for an RP. Being at the end of my rope, I tell them no, because I need a few days off from roleplaying all the damn time and that I'd DM them if I wanted an RP, as someone else on this thread suggested. (Thank you for that, by the way.) Just about 12 hours later, they come to me saying \"Hey, sorry about earlier.\" I'm not sure what they need to be sorry about, but okay. I forgive them for... Honestly, I have no clue what, but I forgive them and clarify my point that I need a few days off from RPing. No response for the rest of the day, I go about the rest of my Saturday.\n\nYou'd think that'd be the end of it, wouldn't you? Few days off, I'll DM them if I want to RP, which at this point might be never again, but point still stands, everything's good, right? WRONG! Today, literally just about 24 hours after I'd posted my last message. Them: \"Hey, how are you?\" Me: \"I'm fine.\" Them: \"Great, want to RP?\" Okay, seriously? Fucking SERIOUSLY? I specifically tell them I want a few days off from RP and they hound me 24 fucking hours later asking for one anyway? How does that make any logical sense? ONE DAY DOES NOT CLASSIFY AS \"A FEW\". So I tell them that. I go \"Sorry to sound like a dick, but I'm pretty sure one day does not classify as \"A few\", as I stated yesterday.\" And they get in a right huff for that, going \"Alright jeez sorry\". It's seriously getting to the point where I'm just going to block them if they ask me for another RP within the next 4 days or so.",
