A lot of time they have this mindset 'I am the victim here, this evil person tells me in their search that they won't write with me' and than they either go off to vent somewhere else, or they decide to 'confront' the person by asking them to write with them and then getting mad when obviously, they don't want to.\n\nA lot of people, even people who everyone else in my roleplaying community thought were completely normal, ignore that I don't like to write romance. They approach me for my search, we start talking, I realize that they want romance (and my search clearly mentions that I don't like it and therefore am not looking for it), and when I tell them they are like 'Yeah, I saw that, but you are an adult and this rule seems stupid, soo..'. And then, they just go on talking about the roleplay as if I did not explicitely tell them that our preferences don't match.\n\nA lot of the men you mention probably think 'Well, what kind of stupid rule is that? I am not a creep, obviously, they should be open to write with me, I will just approach and act as if they are unreasonable if they point it out.' A lot of time they also try the guilt-tripping technique of 'Oh my, do you think I am some kind of pervert? I am deeply hurt that you would accuse me of this. Roleplay with me to show me to me that you did not mean it.' or 'I am such a poor guy, no one wants to write with me, I should stop writing roleplay altogether, people like you show me that I have no place in the roleplaying community, you think I am monster.' to get someone to write with them. Eventually, if you act like that, you will find someone who is insecure enough and agrees to roleplay with you even though you don't meet their requirements. It is sad, but it is true.",

I'd stated in my search that I prefer to play female characters and I guess that's all he really looked at because when I told him that I'm a guy, he promptly wrote, \"Oh..

And other times it is an attempt to get someone to feel bad enough to roleplay with them. Another thing to consider is that this is the internet... people can and will be trolls if the rules allow them to. So consider it a mix of all three. \n\nMe personally, I don't really care about the gender of who I'm roleplaying with. For the kinds of roleplay I like to do, I often run into female and NB people that don't my requirements. I'll make a post wanting a certain kind of RP or character dynamic and where my character will fit in, and I'll get inboxed questions and attempts at them getting me to roleplay a role that I don't really want to.

            "body": "Personally, I don\u2019t really care for IRL gender when it comes to text RP since everyone has their own quirks. And that it\u2019s text, you can just easily ignore anything creepy that comes your way.\n\nBut, from my experience, in TTRPG where using audio / video call is usually the preferred medium to play, some people would prefer a more... comfortable space? Especially, when the creepiness can be visibly heard / seen, which, in my opinion, is a bit harder to swallow than just text on a screen. Especially, when it\u2019s a male-dominated hobby and the male to female ratio is usually 4:1. A friend of mine wanted to make an F / NB only group for a campaign but whenever she tries to recruit people, there\u2019s always a group of male players\u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s never one guy but a group and, sometimes, they make up half of the applicants\u2013 applying anyway regardless of the rules / pre-requisite she put down earlier. Which really brings the question that if they can\u2019t even follow a simple request from the start, what makes them think she\u2019ll think they\u2019ll be able to follow the game\u2019s rules or any house rules she decides to implement?\n\nI hope whatever I said makes sense? Basically, it comes down to preference and comfortability and why can\u2019t people respect other people\u2019s wishes. Also, I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking what you meant by your small corner of RP? I\u2019m just curious and kind of wanna understand more from where you\u2019re coming from.",
