This is going to probably be a bit blunt.\n\nI truly think you should take a break from roleplaying until you can figure out how to keep from developing feelings so quickly. You developed an attraction to him in a couple weeks of role playing, or did I misunderstand?\n\nOnline roleplay partners should *not* become romantic partners, in general. You hear a few success stories and such, but that should have have A LOT more build up then you had here. Plus, you are 17. That is not healthy or safe.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of red flags in this story from both sides. I\u2019m sure you see his, so I will not focus on them, but rest assured I see them to. If someone blocks you, it\u2019s best not to chase them down no matter how much it hurts, especially if it\u2019s been a short partnership. You definitely should not be hounding him for answers or manipulating him. You should not be roleplaying with someone in such a clearly compromised situation. He blocked you twice, and at that point it was time to move on.\n\nDon\u2019t contact him. Block his alt. Don\u2019t respond if he contacts you. Move on. Lots of good partners out there that won\u2019t just be a pile of drama.",

            "body": "How old is he on the social media where he has a wife?  I don't think it's worth it re: confronting, he's gonna weasel out of it.  You're 17 and say he's 21 and that you're both turning 18 and 22 respectively within the year, that's a four year gap with a minor.  He's waffling because he's attracted to a kid but telling himself if he awkwardly hovers around without 'really' offending that he's in the clear.  He's not.  \n\n\n&gt;the gap was too big for me and him and we both had to split ways, I guess he felt conflicted because before I blocked him he added me back and asked to see me because \"I wondered if I'd be attracted to you\" I thought it was weird but I did so anyways, he sent one back and a little after he called me pretty and fumbled with his words, he blocked me.\n\nOkay, so the most *generous* interpretation here: he freaked out at the attraction because he has/is having a wife.\n\n* He learns you're a minor, I imagine he suspected that in the first because there's too much \"oh no I'm a baddie\" waffling even with adultery involved.  He 'gets manipulated' back into contact by a child instead of just blocking, nevermind that 'woe is me I am terrible and must \\*leave\\~' smacks of chase-instigation bait to begin with (Funny how he didn't leave, and then didn't leave again).\n* Instead of backing the fuck off and some introspection upon learning you're a minor he plays the I'm-not-touching-you game of 'only' asking you for pictures because \"I wondered if I'd be attracted to you\" (...to the person he knows is a minor), tells the minor he finds their appearance attractive... and then bails again, because no shit he shouldn't have done that.\n* He now knows what you look like.  You don't know what he looks like.  After this uneven disparity he up and vanishes.\n* He now knows you're a minor.  He's had time to digest and go \"I should leave this person alone, I have a serious relationship and waiting until the nanosecond a kid turns 18 is creepy grooming behaviour that only self-serves the groomer's conscience and not the kid who just hits 18 right that second and knew me when they were a kid and I was an adult\"... but hits you up again, ostensibly for 'just' Rp *knowing he still has feelings*.\n* He then backs out again and gives some woe-is-me apology about \"wanting something he can't have\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe *most generous interpretation here* is he's a gross idiot who got attached to an idea of a person, didn't exercise appropriate boundaries when he discovered they were 17 (Why does a 21 year old man proceed to *ask for pictures when he was supposed to leave?*) and is backstabbing his wife with one-sided emotional affair nonsense.  You don't kid yourself with pretending \"hey, even though I caught a case of The Feels we can both still do platonic stuff right?\" when the reason he was reestablishing contact was those feelings.\n\nIf we're going more damning he's a MAP idiot who thinks he's 'non-offending' because he hasn't touched a child yet despite displaying none of the appropriate restraint and waffling hard when the fact he's being a gross pedo idiot weighs a little too heavily on his conscience.\n\nIf this dipshit hits you up again block him, 'I know you have a wife' optional.",
