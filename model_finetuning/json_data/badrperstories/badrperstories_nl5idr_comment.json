You can usually still say \"I'm having a tough time IRL and I need to stop.\"\n\nI have also had situations exactly like yours, including one where someone went poof after 350+ pages on the Google doc and when we had the whole rest of the plot planned out.  She came back months later asking to resume.  I said no, first because I had moved on to a new partner, and second because I knew I would never be able to trust her again and it would ruin my enjoyment of writing with her.",

This happened to me before and I know that is heartbreaking. \n\nBut I also have to say you one thing. \nI once ghosted, and i wasn't able to return to that mate explaining the situation. \nI have some mental issues, that usually are undercontroll, so I have basically no problems. \nBut a couple of years ago i went under a really stressfull period, like, something i wasn't able to handle. \nAnd i ghosted. \nI wasn't able to write, not in discord, nor fb or even wsa. Everything triggered me. \nAnd then, when after a lot i was able again to return, i felt so ashamed that i wasn't able to write my excuses. Someone had wrote to me asking how i was, or to write whenni will be back, and i was able to write to them, but this particular mate asked a couple of time and then didn't write anything, and i wasn't able to write to them.\n\nSo my opinion and my suggestion is, since she didn't block you, write her you will be there. It is not you, clearly but her problems, so, just write her that yiu love her, that you enjoyed your friendship and your role, and that you hope she is good and when she wants to come back, or can, you will be there. \n\nIt is the best you can do. If she is in a burn out, she will appreciate a lot. \nBut then, try to move on, even if it's difficult.",
