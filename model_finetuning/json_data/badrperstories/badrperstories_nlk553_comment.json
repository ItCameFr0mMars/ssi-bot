Not to paint a grim picture but checking out entirely didn't seem like something he'd do if he was enthused to find you again on another MMO.\n\nBut unfortunately that means his other friends also dropped the ball, and that's also something I'm currently dealing with, so I know the frustration you feel, and the lack of closure for never knowing why. Feeling abandoned, and having trust broken.\n\nI'm sorry you had to be on the receiving end of such an empty room of a feeling, left to only hear your own echoes and wonder if you're the last one there or if someone else can even hear you. I hope maybe you find your way back to roleplay when the pain is less, or that you get an answer someday.",

            "body": "I once read an incredible article about online roleplaying. I think it was specifically about MUDs and MUSHes. I've never been able to find it again, but there was someone quoted in it and they said the best and worst part of roleplaying was that it allowed you to have memories of things that had never happened to you. I feel like it's the best description of the power - and horror - of roleplaying.\n\nIt is ridiculous, I think, to think that bleed doesn't happen to people or only happens to bad RPers. Bleed is a key aspect of roleplaying well, of allowing yourself to feel and ride the emotions. But it's something you have to control, something you have to be aware of that you're using as a tool to add some spice. I think the more isolated aspect of online roleplaying - since you're often alone in your room or study or wherever when doing it - also can lead to the emotional experiences being heightened.\n\nIt breeds drama outside of the actual roleplay because it is, in my opinion, basically the same thing as everything outside the roleplay. If you're roleplaying, you can't devote the same amount of time and attention to every single person, and that can be tough to negotiate on either side of the fence. Sometimes it's just that you resonate better with some people than others. Sometimes it comes down to timezones and schedules. It's no different to trying to navigate a social life - but maybe open to being more painful, because roleplaying allows us to expose parts of ourselves to others, making us vulnerable in ways we wouldn't be in real life.",
