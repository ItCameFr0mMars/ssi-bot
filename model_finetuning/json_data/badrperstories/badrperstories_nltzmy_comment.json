You should just be up front and honest about how you do/don't want to write that character. There are plenty of places to compromise in order to have a great roleplaying partnership with someone but some things you shouldn't feel bad about standing your ground on!",

It\u2019s just fiction, not a magical event that takes away that characters importance or significance.\n\nUnless they are openly homophobic and projected that through the character, it\u2019s as harmless as making them gay when they\u2019re canonically not. \n\nAs a pan man, I do understand why you think it\u2019s offensive but the reality is that it\u2019s not. The person didn\u2019t do anything wrong from what I can see.\n\nI think you\u2019re taking a bit too personally but that\u2019s just my opinion. If it bothers you, make it clear that you do not play as or in a straight pairing.",
