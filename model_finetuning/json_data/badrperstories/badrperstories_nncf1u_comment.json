Taking your time is worth it because posts do get better, but if you're in the mood to RP a few posts a day, it can get a little tiresome to wait an hour for each &amp; every post.\n\nMy advice would be to talk things through how many posts you'd like to post a day &amp; if you can compromise on that.\n\nSometimes RL gets in between or other things &amp; partners tend to not play for a few days, or just write one post a day/week. Other times partners would like to do several posts in a day/evening, because they'd like to spend their free time on progressing the story &amp; just having a good time. On days like that I'd recommend doing shorter posts. But only if you guys would be happy with that of course.",

There is nothing wrong with taking your time to get perfect grammar and if thats what you like that is what you like and if they cant understand that then it's their fault. But I personally think you should try to compromise and say \"hi it stress me to write fast\" and work together to meet In the middle. \n\nI like to think in rping you learn abit from each partner and grow.
