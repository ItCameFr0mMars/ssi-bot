            "body": "\nI think if you're not the type to chat much OOC you could possibly solve it without saying anything about it? Where you can just try to only drop an OOC response after you've dropped an RP response? And limit it to that? I dunno. Could work? There's no need to constantly engage in OOC if you don't want to and have already made that clear. But by at least replying in both OOC and IC at the same time he won't feel ignored? I suggest this because some people need to feel at ease to write with someone else, and radio silence in OOC makes them nervous. So it'd be kind of a meet halfway sorta thing. \n\nNow if they are demanding/impatient in OOC for you to chat with them, then I'd definitely bring it up. It's always hard to know how to bring something gently though so there is no foolproof solution. People can get offended or hurt at the slightest of things. \n\nIf I were you I'd simply remind them how you've already made clear in your ad that you aren't much for chatting OOC and that it's nothing to do with them, it's just how you roll. Despite that their lack of posting and only trying to chat in OOC makes it seem as such, I definitely wouldn't throw the 'I'm not interested in a friendship' in the mix because just trying to have friendly chitchat with an RP partner does not necessarily mean they're out for that. Some people just want to at least connect a bit and keep a form of OOC going because it makes them feel more comfortable to write. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "body": "This is one of those cases were there is a solid chance they\u2019ve just forgotten. Personally, I default to being active ooc, I like chatting, I *adore* plotting. It\u2019s enjoyable to me. Sometimes I\u2019m quite active ooc but not at all ic \u2014 that can be for numerous reasons, because it\u2019s a longer post and I\u2019m not at my computer, I\u2019m too busy to focus on that but can handle short messages, I don\u2019t feel up to writing the post but that takes less brainpower, etc.\n\nHowever, I have *no problem* turning down my ooc if my partner does not enjoy it. I still need some \u2014 I\u2019ll come at you with ideas for sure \u2014 but I can cut out everything else. The issue though is that sometimes when roleplaying with multiple people, they forget what they read in your ad, especially \u201cdetails\u201d like that. I do try to take cue from my partner \u2014 at first I\u2019ll probably be chatty but if they don\u2019t respond too much I\u2019ll back off. I tend to send an ooc message after each post, but if they don\u2019t do that, I stop. I know I can be an over chatter so a strive to make sure I don\u2019t overwhelm. It\u2019s possible your partner has not gained those skills yet, or is feeling like they\u2019re getting a different message from you.\n\nSo I can come to this discussion as someone who has *probably* done this to someone once or twice. In my opinion, I would just want you to tell me. A quick message like \u201cHey, I just wanted to see if you remember that I really don\u2019t like ooc chat that much? It seems that you do and I just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page\u201d would probably have me apologizing and then backing off. Maybe also make it clear exactly what you are looking for so they don\u2019t disappear completely for fear of upsetting you \u2014 like, make sure they know you still want them to tell you when they\u2019ll be gone for a bit, and how you feel about plotting and ooc messages directly related to the roleplay.",
