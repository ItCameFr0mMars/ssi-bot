            "body": "You have known this person for ten years. That's a long time and (I imagine) a significant friendship. I know you said you've tried asking if there's anything you can do on the roleplay front to improve things, but I think it's worth opening a very frank conversation. Something like,\n\n\"Hey, I won't keep harping on this, but I've been worried about you. We used to talk so much, but it feels like here lately, you haven't wanted to as often. I just want you to know if you've got a lot going on, you can always talk to me. Or, if you need space, I can back off for a while until you're ready. We can pause our RPs or change them if you need to. I don't want to be a source of stress in your life, and I promise there's no hard feelings if you need time away. I'll be here whenever.\"\n\nIf that's met with more of the same, it's of course time to stop bringing it up. You'd then have to reevaluate how much time and energy you want to invest in the friendship. You don't have to renounce your friend, but if they won't acknowledge their distance or put effort into the friendship, you should not try to carry it on your back. That's a difficult and shitty feeling, and I hope it doesn't come to it.\n\nHopefully, they can at least tell you whether it's you or outside circumstances, and things can resume as normal someday.",

For the sake of your mental health, I would end the RP. Tell the person that you're just going to end the RolePlay. You can decide if you want to tell them how the radio silence made you feel or not, but from my read of what you've told me I assume they have something going on IRL and they're deeply uncomfortable with RolePlaying right now or addressing the issue. \n\nThey may be your friend of 10 years, but you got to take care of yourself first.

            "body": "How old is your partner? People can go through significant changes in terms of free time, motivation, interests, mental energy, and chemistry after 10 years. Not all of these changes are necessarily gradual; some might happen relatively quickly. \n \nSometimes writing with someone else can seem to renew and restore energy; other times, that same writing might drain a person to a point where they can\u2019t keep bringing themselves to continue. This can happen despite the collaboration being wonderful. It\u2019s not necessarily anyone\u2019s fault, or even preventable.\n\nSometimes the other stressors in a person\u2019s life eventually rob them of the ability to enjoy hobbies they used to love. They might not fully realize what\u2019s going on if this happens, and so they might not have any answer when asked about it directly. \n\nYou\u2019ve asked, and she hasn\u2019t answered. Yes, it sucks, but asking one more time isn\u2019t likely to give you additional information. She probably would have told you by now if it was something she was able to talk about. It doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong, or that your writing wasn\u2019t up to par. If your writing hadn\u2019t been compatible with hers, she probably wouldn\u2019t have written with you for so long. \n\nIt might be a good idea for you to simply take a break from the hobby for now, since you\u2019re not feeling motivated toward it. Take care of your own mental health, remember that this likely isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, and give yourself time to mourn the loss of an enjoyable collaboration. You might write with her (or someone else) in the future, or you might end up pursuing other hobbies instead. Either way, try to be gentle with yourself during this time. You were clearly very invested in this partnership, and change can be extremely difficult. Time can sometimes provide perspective.",
