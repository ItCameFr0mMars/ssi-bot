            "body": "Honestly I think this is partly luck.\n\nYou need to find someone you mesh well with, pick a plot you both love and will not grow bored of, AND both have the time and mental energy to get it through the early stages safely.\n\nPast that, to me, the most important thing about a long term partner is *patience*. Everyone has times they can crank out 5 posts a day. Everyone has times they need a week or two, or even more. I have a roleplay partner I have been roleplaying with for over 5 years. We have 6 roleplays together. She is absolutely my favourite partner, no question no contest. The reason we work so well together is that we are patient. There are times that we don\u2019t post for two months because someone needed a break. There are times we post daily with all roleplays. There are times we focus on one or two roleplays and ignore the rest temporarily. The reason it works is because I no longer feel bad if I drop off the planet for a week without warning. I know she\u2019ll be there when I get back, ready to jump into plotting again. And it goes both ways.\n\nOf course, that will not work for everyone. But if someone is not patient and willing to deal with the fact that sometimes life happens, it will not work long term with me. And probably not for anyone, because no matter how many times their ad says they will always respond 10 times a day, sometimes everyone needs a break.",

You just have to keep at it, tank some rejections and ghostings, and unless your wants are very unusual (like the pokemon dungeon fetish guy who pops up on all the subs periodically) you'll definitely find someone in the end.",

I realize how lucky I am to have my real long term rp partner and friend of over 4 years. Funnily enough she was the first person I ever messaged to rp. I had never rp'd in my life and she didn't mind one bit! She's super patient and understanding. Her writing goes above and beyond mine and on top of that she's an artist. We actually send each other parcels at christmas and she sends me drawings of our ocs lol. I think patience and understanding goes a long way and just being a decent human being lol.",

The right person will come and in the mean time just enjoy the shorter term partners. They help you get more experience to be a better writer and partner yourself. Also ask those who drop the roleplay what you could improve on. Don\u2019t take it to heart, but try it out and see if you like it. Everyone\u2019s gonna connect with different people.

A lot of gems on there still, although a younger crowd has slowly weaseled through. It takes a lot of time and advertising to find a partner like that.\n\n Longterm isn't as simple as asking for a partner to do longterm, you've gotta find someone whose willing to stay with you and be honest, even if they're losing interest. Someone who can go on hiatus for a month and you'll be fine with it and vice versa. You've gotta come to some-sort of compromise because you can't have it all. That kind of relationship takes a lot of time to form and writing is a very time-demanding hobby.",

Maybe, a few people can actually post 5 times a day indefinitely or everyday\u2014But the reality is, they don't. There are roleplayers who demand so much from their partners than wonder *why* they can't find anybody. Nobody can continuously reply everyday for months or even years. Things happen, people burnout.\n\nA lot of outsiders think of roleplay quite poorly, but it's a widely-branched hobby entirely based on writing. Writing just isn't that easy, and if it was....Everyone here would be popping out full novels like it's nothing. Writing, even roleplay writing takes time, patience, and motivation. It's difficult to find the motivation to finish a story, roleplay included. Fanfic authors discontinuing their stories isn't that far off from a roleplayer going on hiatus or ending a roleplay due to burnout.\n\nIf you really want a longterm partner, you have to find someone whose willing to be patient. Whose not quick to anger or discouraged when the roleplay suddenly halts for a week or more. Who understands writing is hard and not assume the absolute worst about their partner. And finding that person, even if it takes long, is very much worth it.",
