She should have told you up front that she did not like waiting. So, you two could have either made a plan or either of you could have said \u201cthis isn't working.\u201d I hope you don't feel like you're in the wrong because you weren't. She is the wrong one, especially how she reacted. People don't understand that there are other people behind these screens that you have feelings. She could have been much more mature about this, she is going to have a lot of trouble with future partners.",

            "body": "\"I thought we were friends after a few months.\" Yes, this is unfortunately how it goes....You consider them a friend, but they vanish. This is why I personally consider online friends completely different from IRL now. We might chill and have similar interests for a few months or even a year, but we're far from friends. Friendship, much like roleplay, can be very demanding to maintain. All it takes is not talking to each other for a few weeks and it's pretty much over.\n\nIt also sadly doesn't surprise me she didn't speak her true feelings to you, the Roleplay community has a huge problem with confrontation. None of us like hurting people's feelings or we avoid confronting someone at all costs. It often leads to ghosting or one side getting unnecessarily angry and do irrationally things last minute such as what she did to you. You'd think roleplay would be an outgoing hobby that requires very good communication skills, when ironically a good chunk of us are sensitive introverted writers sucked into our own fantasies of fiction.\n\nIf I could see the statistics of people in specifically one-on-one roleplays, I'd honestly read it in a heartbeat because I'm very curious at just how many of us are aimlessly wandering after one partner to the next. Some people do manage to find amazing long term partners, but it seems infinitely more difficult to find now for multiple reasons. \n\nI bet well over 50% of roleplayers ghost, unintentionally or intentionally. It's just unfortunately how it is.",

I DM a few text games and when my head's not there, I'll let my players know that I'm taking a break, but I'll still pop in to share memes and joke around with them. I only hope that they understand that the part of the brain for writing/DMing is different from the part of the brain for small socializing. Because otherwise, I'm sure they're wondering, \"Hey, DM. If you have time for this, maybe you could move the game on?\" but are too polite to say such things.\n\nThat said, I'm sorry. I was devastated when I lost someone I considered a good friend when I had to exit him from a game because of some personality/play-style mismatches. I thought we could continue to be friends without the game. (Possibly even be better friends without the game causing conflict.) I was wrong, and it was a hard lesson for me to learn. It's difficult to judge tone and meaning through only text. Sometimes we see things that aren't there. Sometimes things are better than they seem (when we read sarcasm into a genuine compliment), sometimes things are worse than they seem, and sometimes things are simply nothing (like the friendly how are you that the person asks out of habit but not really caring about an answer or the small chitchat of someone really just hoping that the writing will resume soon).",

            "body": "I mean, I feel like I definitely see a lot of posts on here about people complaining when others have issue with them having personal lives and being not as active as they'd like, so I can kind of understand why she would have kept saying \"it's fine\" when it wasn't. She probably felt like she wasn't in a place to ask or demand more activity from you, but at the same time, the lack of consistency was draining her muse for your story.   \n\n\nThat said, she didn't ghost you. She told you she wasn't into it anymore and then bowed out. Ghosting is where someone just vanishes off the face of the earth without any explanation. She gave you way more than that. It sounds like she held on as long as she could, but she's a role player who wasn't getting RP from you. Your experiences and your needs are valid, but so are hers.   \n\n\nShe did try to be patient with you, but everyone's patience has an end. It sucks that hers ended at the same time as you had a death in your family. You have my condolences for that, by the way. But I can see why she got frustrated when you'd go almost a month between replies while messaging her every day. That would frustrate me too, and I would probably bow out as well. The every day messages would read to me as if we were more friends who sometimes write together than writing partners who are friends, and if you guys initially linked up to be writing partners, then that was you not upholding your end of the bargain. It sounds callous, and I'm sure to be downvoted for this, I just don't altogether think she was entirely in the wrong here.",

I had a situation where I was in the woman\u2019s position\u2014 I had a partner that I had been writing with for a year or so, we met because of rp and became friends ooc. Eventually they started talking to me exclusively ooc whilst no longer rping because their muse was Low. I also tried to be understanding, telling them it was fine until weeks turned into months and whilst I had high muse, they had none. It was difficult, because as much as I wanted to be understanding and patient it also made me feel quite dejected and I started to harbour resentment towards them. I doubt the woman intentionally lied to you, she probably wanted to be as patient as possible like others said, but it can feel hurtful\u2014 so she took a step back and decided it wasn\u2019t worth it any more. No one is at  fault here, and sometimes life just happens. \n\nMy partner and I have made our peace with it, and we still talk ooc. I\u2019ve had to come to terms with it but it was not easy.",
