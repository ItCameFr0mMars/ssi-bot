In truth, I just really wanted to show people that I am a decent roleplayer, and those things I added felt more like concrete evidence to me that I had it in me. I never even thought to think about coming off as snarky or overconfident: this unfortunately runs in my family and I've had to check myself multiple times to make sure I don't sound so high and mighty. Looking back at things, I will gladly change all of these and take out what you've wrote about. I just need to figure out a way to come off as inviting, and not so intimidating next time. \n\nThank you. I really needed to hear this",

            "body": "There's certainly nothing in your profile that looks like it'd scare anyone off.  \n\nI don't have that many notes on your typical response.   I would highly suggest getting rid of that whole part about your high school AP English class.  Also that part about having had 70+ partners could be turning people off as well.  Simply put that you're proficient with grammar and your style is easily adaptable.\n\nI'd also maybe suggest that instead of sending an example of your writing right off the bat, that you just say that you'd be happy to send a writing example on request.  That way, since you're adaptable, you can send an example that fits in with the particular style they're looking for.  The turtle password can then be stuck somewhere else.\n\nIt's also kind of strange to have a password in a reply to someone else's ad.  Some might be finding that off-putting, especially if their own ad didn't have one.  I don't think it's a big deal to keep it in, but it's just something to be aware of.\n\nI have no way of knowing what ads you've responded to so this next advice might be useless.  Your example is an excellent response to an ad that's looking for a partner in general, but it wouldn't be good for one that's asking for a specific story.  Specific ads need specific replies or it looks like you didn't really read them and just sent a copy-paste reply.  Again, not sure if this applies at all, but I thought I'd mention it just in case.\n\nOverall, I think it's a great reply, though I'd personally tweak it a bit.  You're free to disagree.  Also keep in mind that people can get a lot of replies so it's kind of a numbers game.  It may not be that you're doing anything wrong at all.  You sound like a fun person to write with so I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are interested.",

            "body": "So everyone gave the main advice I was considering (grades, partner count, password should all be gone for me) so I won\u2019t repeat that in detail. One thing I would like to highlight is that things tend to go over WAY better if you show you\u2019ve read their post. Unless you are responding to one of those \u201cno idea, send me whatever\u201d people, I\u2019d recommend you include what you are interested in from their post, and if you have any ideas to go with it (not usually a problem if you don\u2019t have any).\n\nThink of your first message less like a resume, and more like a cover letter. You don\u2019t want to copy and paste the same thing to everyone. It\u2019s a turn off and makes them think you did not read their ad. You want to tailor the response to the person; say why you think you two would be a good match, reference things in their ad, tell them which of their ideas or genres you are interested in. If you are presenting your own idea that is totally fine, just tell them why you think they\u2019ll like it. Even just \u201cyou said you liked medieval fantasy, and I might have an idea up your alley?\u201d.\n\nPersonally, I generally don\u2019t copy and paste anything when I am sending requests. I write a new one for each partner, following their lead. By that I mean, did their ad tell me unrelated interests of theirs? I will do the same. Was it straight to business? I am too. Do I know their age, timezone, roleplaying experience? Then I tell them mine too.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying copying and pasting is bad. That\u2019s fine, especially if you are sending out a number of requests at once. It\u2019s a huge timesaver. But I recommend tailoring at least the first paragraph to their ad, and then follow with the copying and pasted material.",

When you introduce yourself to someone (even in real life) you have to be essential, tell them the fundamental things that identify you and define you, then you can add more as the talk goes on.",
