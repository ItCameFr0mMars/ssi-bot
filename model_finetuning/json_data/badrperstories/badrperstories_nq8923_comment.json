There were a couple examples, but a number of people shared experiences in discord chats where the behavior has been to loudly and overtly protest discussion of \"triggers\" like spiders/bugs. In contrast to that, the general Millennial reaction is to just step back from the chat for a bit and resume later when people are done. Obviously there are generalizations here (and might be less of a generational thing and more of a hyper-woke overly sensitive online culture in some areas), but it does kind of seem like a growing trend across multiple spheres.",

In MMOs the community was far different. More cismale, more combat oriented, lots of het stuff. In discord groups found through reddit it was a mixed bag somewhere between those two, in Conan Exiles, well... it's *something.* And so on, etc.\n\nIt sounds like DeviantArt might be fostering a certain flavor of community that you don't enjoy anymore, so it might be good to branch out and see if you can find one that fits.\n\nI once found myself in a group that had a blacklist so large and extensive I had to laugh at it. The *name* Matthew wasn't allowed, neither were 'frogs' in general (when one of the characters *is froglike, by the way*), an entire possible ship was blacklsited from being mentioned, the list went on and on.

The \u201cevery dad is amazing\u201d shit annoys me, I opt out of company emails for Father\u2019s Day, but I\u2019m not going to demand a trigger warning for the concept of fathers LOL. Also stuff like biting, raising voices (in rp....?), people/characters of a certain age, ghosts, mentions of a political PARTY at all, certain pieces of media (I\u2019ve seen TW requests for Hamilton more than once LOL), etc. Like dude come on.
