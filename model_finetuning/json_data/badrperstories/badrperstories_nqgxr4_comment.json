Real dialogues don't work like that. They're back-and-forth and fast paced. Some people make the mistake of writing lengthy speeches to compensate for post size, I think that does more harm than good - it can break immersion, at least for me.",

            "body": "I honestly think RP\u2019s focus on length has done it more harm than good. Yeah, most of my posts do not fit in one discord message, which means they are 4+ paragraphs usually (although I do have partners I do far less with). But sometimes *you just don\u2019t need that*. And why is that such an issue? Like come on, it\u2019s fine for posts to be shorter, especially when they are talking.\n\nMy personal rule. . . Write what you need. Often my dialogue posts are 3-4 paragraphs at least \u2014 1 is responding to what they said, 1 is simple actions and thoughts, 1 is adding something new \u2014 but not always. Sometimes you simply do not need that.\n\nSo I guess my advice, is don\u2019t bother. Find partners who don\u2019t care.\n\nAlthough I would like to echo what the other person said \u2014 actions make posts come alive, even in dialogue. Don\u2019t just have them speak. Give them small movements, even nervous ticks.  Do they bite their lip when nervous? Do they constantly shift and cross and uncross their legs? Do they lean forward when talking intently?  Do they rub their forehead when they need a second to think about things, or sip on water? All of that makes things feel more alive, and gives your character more personality. And it\u2019s very natural \u2014 people are constantly moving and shifting without even realizing it.\n\nYou can also sprinkle some thoughts in dialogue posts. Tell me what their reaction was to what my character said, through words, yes, but also thoughts and emotions and physical actions (as discussed). Of course you do not want to go too far on this \u2014 3 paragraphs of thoughts in what is supposedly 2 seconds feels overdone. But there\u2019s ways to do smoothly, either just in between the words they are saying, or as it\u2019s own paragraph. I had a post recently where what they said kind of triggered something inside of him, something far bigger then what really fit, but I felt not detailing it, even in the middle of the conversation would be a disservice. So basically they got a partly off topic couple paragraphs which I ended with: \u201cNone of these thoughts showed on his face though, as they were only thought in passing. They bothered him in quieter times, when alone or when trying to fall asleep, but not now.\u201d\n\nPersonally *I* thought it worked well. Although this brings me back to \u201cwrite what you need\u201d. If I had *not* needed that, I would not have forced another 2 paragraphs of fluff into the post.",

Mix it in with the actions to combine them. Like here's an example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"You're off the case, Paxton.\" *The Captain was direct in his demand for Jonathan to drop what he had been putting weeks of investigative work into at the docks and the smuggling operation.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Standing before his commanding officer, Detective Jonathan Paxton's eyes would narrow as he heard what his Captain was saying. Drop the case? But he was so close to catching his perp who was smuggling at the dock! He just needed more time! Jonathan's fingers flex and squeeze to form fists at his sides as his nostrils flare.* ***\"Frankly, Captain, this is bullshit. This is MY case!\"*** *And he yells those words at his superior officer now, anger and irritation oozing from the police detective.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You're done!\" *The Captain can only shout back in an outraged tone as the Detective turns to stomp out, not bothering to respond to the demands that he cease and desist in his investigation. This wasn't over. Not yet, it wasn't.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProbably not my best work but I like to combine actions and feelings along with the dialogue. Really sets the tone and mood for scenes.

Setting up and ending scenes are all well and good, but a combination of scenery, actions, and setting up your characters thoughts and feelings through actions also go a long way as well. Its how I like to mix things up at least.\n\nThank you for the compliments on my posting style.
