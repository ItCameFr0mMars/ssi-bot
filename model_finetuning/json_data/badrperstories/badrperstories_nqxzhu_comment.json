            "body": "You have strong introspection happening here, I admire that. My two cents is this: maybe you don't really want to RP. Maybe you want a collaborative writing partner. I think there is a difference. \n\nA collaborative writing partner that is well matched to you will want to have conversations about world and character building. They may or may not write solely for separate characters. It may be more practical to write in a g-doc for editing and comments. Also for interweaving the writing. It may be helpful to have a separate doc or place to record ideas, details, etc.\n\nMaybe try an ad on r/WriteWithMe instead?\n\n(I could be totally wrong, but I don't think your perfectionism is a problem, I just think you're trying to fit yourself into a slightly adjacent space to where you may better thrive.) \n\nBest wishes!",

And I just jump right in with a vague idea of who they are, and let them tell me. I also think I have a pretty good sense of figuring out what my partner is looking for, and I find it makes romance feel way more natural because I end up tailoring my character to theirs.\n\nLike for instance, I had a roleplay ad up that included a rough plot and the character I wanted to play. I *did* actually have a basic idea in mind for him: young adult, with a twin brother. The two were a pair and he spent most of his life being the submissive one and following his brother and other siblings around, rarely making decisions. Maybe the goody-two-shoes trying to keep his more troublemaking brother out of trouble, but ending up in trouble himself instead.\n\nThis has since started 3 different roleplays (I don\u2019t mind reusing plots when they are basic, because they can be twisted so much so they never end up the same). One of them he\u2019s actually following that pretty well. Another, he\u2019s kept some of the insecurities but he\u2019s far stronger and is honestly just a shrewd tactician. The third, he\u2019s nothing like that at all \u2014 he\u2019s a natural leader, who just *cares* for people. Completely separate characters because I realized they fit better in both the world we built and who I was playing against.",

Not every character works out, and that's okay!\n\nIf you just cannot get through the RPing step until you know your character, write a series of vignettes. Throw them into some intense situations and write their way out of them (or deeper in). It's fun, it's good practice, and it will absolutely help you get to know your characters.",
