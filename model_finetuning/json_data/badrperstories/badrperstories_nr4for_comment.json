It's purely a manipulation tactic meant to make their writing partner feel off balance. Like negging basically, but for RP.

It ended up being a hardcore anime rp which I wasn't prepared for, and the 10-ish people that joined all wrote massive walls of text, 2000 characters a message, up to 3 messages for one response.
