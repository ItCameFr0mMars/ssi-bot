            "body": "It's not wrong to mourn the loss of a friend and writing partner to whatever cause.  Generally in a case like that I would let the character \"rest\" for a while and play with other ones, then reintroduce them to someone else when time has passed, if I really felt attached.  (Usually I don't, though, since I do 1x1s only it's more common for me to invent someone new each time).\n\nI got overly attached to a roleplayer once, who was a little younger (maybe 5 years) and was enthusiastically into me and inexplicably not turned off by pictures (my usual way to head off flirters).  He claimed to be the same religion, called me Boss, teased me about punishing him, generally pushed all my domme buttons.  \n\nAnd then one night he sent me an unsolicited drunken dick pic, then ghosted for months.  That gave me enough distance on it to realize that infatuation isn't the same as love, and just because I was into him physically as well as his compatible kink didn't mean it was meant to be.  When he came back much later asking to rp, I said no.\n\nThat was one of few times I've tried repurposing a character into a new rp.  It didn't really work, the new guy disliked the character so much that he made our first interaction a short story and asked to continue with a different character of mine invented for him on the spot.  At that point I gave up and concluded the original character wasn't suitable for rp.  The next time I did anything in the same setting, I invented someone new that I felt would be more palatable to a partner.",
