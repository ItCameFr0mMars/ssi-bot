This is why it's important for 18+ folks to do everything in their power to check their writing partners' ages, because young teens simply do not realize (usually) that lying about how old they are can have serious consequences.\n\nBack in 1999, I was one of those 11 year old RPers lying about their age and writing sex scenes I didn't even understand. Like you, I didn't really want to write these things, but it absolutely did not occur to my kid brain for whatever reason to stop the RP and say \"I'm not comfortable with this.\" Obviously I regret that, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. You live and you learn, and it sounds like you know now you shouldn't have been writing that stuff at 14.\n\nYou blocked the guy and got yourself out of the situation; that was the right thing to do! Just remember that everything in roleplay is a choice, and you do not have to do anything you don't want to do. As long as you're true to your own boundaries, it won't happen again.",
