And with longterm partners, this shit happened twice (the convention thing, copying my interests and telling me I imagined stuff when I mentioned parts of their stories which they did not like anymore), this was the most hurtful. The other stuff is something which I noticed while group roleplaying (the fake accounts, the guy who said he was an artist an who also lied about playing basketball).\n\nBut to be fair, I am already roleplaying for 14 years, so it is not like this happens every other week. These experiences just seem to have huge impact on me, especially those when I noticed someone I liked basically lied for me for a year. It was so weird too, because I always thought 'Maybe I understood them wrong and they never said this', but when I talked with a friend about it he remembered it as well, and the old chats still showed our conversations.",

It was awful, and makes you paranoid about everyone you have been chatting with, you start thinking anyone could be connected to them and so you have been living your own personal mini Truman show. I guess this person is having troubles or conducts a troubled life and her only relief was roleplaying a dollhouse of fake people who cared about her, however once the first account started to act suspiciously, her whole net of alternates turned out to be fake as well and our relationship was cut shortly after. I agree it is mad hard to understand if people are being fake or not through the web and I know for a fact people will say anything for attention. It is sad and disturbing to hear people still do this, and everyone who goes through the same troubles as I did has my sympathy.",

She always kept marking the fact \"a lot of people contacted her secretly\" because \"they did not trust the admin group\" and bloated the numbers of those people to the point that it exceeded even the people in the server. \n\nBy looking at some other replies you got there are definitely ways of telling if the person you are looking at is a fake account, such as by contacting as many accounts as possible and see if they can withstand a proper conversation without having to \"take turns\", otherwise there are bots or sites made to verify the account legitimacy or the age of it. Of course all these are meaningless against a talented scammer, however, I believe any bit can help.",
