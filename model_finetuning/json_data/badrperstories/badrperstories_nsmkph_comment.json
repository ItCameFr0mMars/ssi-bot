            "body": "I feel like 99% of drama with RP comes from miscommunication. Maybe you should try letting them know that while you're flattered you're noticing some troubling trends that is making you want to limit your contact. If she's unreasonable then you know you need to cut them out.\n\nThis is a hobby. So many people seem to forget that. I spend most of my free time rping, I get that it gets annoying, I have players I would rather avoid but can't because of groups. I love group RP, 1x1 doesn't hit the spot as much for me. Groups require a lot of communication and collaboration. It seems like you're lacking both in this instance.\n\nThat being said, one time an RPer really irritated me was when they tried to coerce me into rping their weird kink by manipulating what the story was and requesting specific actions take place. They had a cleaning fetish turns out and even offered to send me a PDF of directions their \"girlfriend\" wrote to help me \"get into it.\"\n\nYeah my ad said no kinks, no smut. Then they had the audacity to ask me not to kink shame them when they lied about the plot/story to begin with just to get me to write something they could jerk it too. For the record I did not, all I did was ask what the heck was with the obsession with cleaning. Ugh. If I'm writing for your kinks I expect to get paid otherwise what the hell am I even getting out of it?! I'll tell you what\u2014a partner that will annoy you and pressure you because they want to get their rocks off and you're their new type monkey. No thanks.",

I used to but now that I'm getting old, the drama and amount of time/effort doesn't yield a high pay off anymore for me. I think your group needs to boot her or go off on your own if she's really not bringing anything positive to your group. I mean life is too short to be around writers (or anyone for that matter) who create needless drama and negativity. I will say when I did GM groups about 10+ years ago, we never had issues with annoying partners but I was also a pretty strict GM and a good GM makes a world of difference in group settings.",

            "body": "Yeah, I tried that once and while worked back then, she continues making drama and well, being annoying - I can't entirely cut her because we're all part of a community and all characters need to interact, besides that if I try talking to her about it, I just know already the huge drama she's going to make over that and possibly make me look like a bully. I just know her a little by now.   \n\n\nShe's the type of person that she's being so negative over something and you try to reason with her, she won't even analyze the situation and simply tell you that you're a liar and not understanding even though you do - for example when she made the drama over me and the other admin no responding to her rp's, I seriously tried to talk to her about it; Sometimes the muse for a certain character is not high or for the post in general, and trust me, I have nothing against random threads but I feel more inspired for one that it's deep and something interesting is actually happening - with her the rp's are a bit random and doesn't have a depth in it. But if I tell her that? I can already see the drama attacking me.   \n\n\nWhile I don't have a problem with \"he smiled\" and simple description because can actually be interesting too if one adds story in it, develop the rp and actually head somewhere, this roleplayer is really boring and it's hard for me to be active when something doesn't inspire me - I try to keep myself as active as I can be with this person but honestly I just am more inspired and active with our other friend because there is actually stuff going on. And I'm not even that inactive, I reply to the annoying roleplayer a few times a week - it's the love interest that she's making a drama with because I don't hype as much or plot as much with her or reply to as much as with our other friend. For some context, the ship I have with her is just erp or fluff and if we try to add drama, she turns it into a cringy drama while with our other friend out ships have story, slow burn process, feelings, complications, etc.  \n\n\nI know communication is key but, god, try telling this girl that her rp isn't inspiring or that the plot is too shallow and she'll go insane. I tried to tell her something more subtle like it's because my character muse that I wasn't active with her but she attacked me about it calling me a liar. And honestly? She's obsessed over us. Like seriously. She is in other groups and she's the one inactive there when she has a bunch of roleplayers she could interact with THERE - but prefers to whine over us not being that active with her.   \n\n\nShe once told me that she never felt as bad in her other groups and as rejected as she feels in this one, and I just had to stalk the group to see what she was referring about but literally, they don't hype as much with their ships and do the same as me and our other friend - in fact, she's the one who ignores in there. Honestly it just feels like she's obsessed over me and our friend pretty bad; if we don't like/agree with her ideas, she feels bad and becomes bitchy (TO ME, not our friend). If we hype about our ships but not with hers, same. If we have some likings in common, doesn't matter if she has no clue what that liking is about, she pretends to love it as well. Etc. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nOh god, there are seriously so many wrong's in that. If you already had it established, the least they could do was to either discuss it calmly with you and leave if wasn't their cup of tea - sounds to me like a god complex or something as fucked up. And the PDF- sometimes I wonder if some roleplayers actually are aware that roleplay is not a way to satisfy one's kink - having a PDF about it just... sounds like too much and it's cringy. Besides, if your rules were no kink, no smut... what were they even doing wanting to rp with your in first place? Only leave a bitter taste and for one to have a bad moment that wasn't even needed. Honestly I feel they were too deep into Attack On Titan and were obsessed over one of the characters in there that had this sort of cleaning obsession, that's all I can think about - some people really impress me with their type of mindset. Like roleplay is supposed to be fun, to enjoy the time and be something /mutual/, not to make one's fantasy come true or make them the main character. I mean in any case they can write a book by their own.",

That already happened a few years ago in the same group but I came back because I thought that maybe growing up, things would change and while I'm way more happy now than back then, she continues being a bitch. Except that there's this addition that she copies my characters, get obsessed over me and our other friend and generall makes DRAMA if things doesn't happen the way she wants.  \n\n\nI don't think she's getting booted off, she's close friends with the main admin and like I said, she's a complete two faced. She has everyone under this spell and everyone believes her to be an amazing friend but when she textes me? A complete bitchy drama queen and I'm sure she'll know her way to manipulate stuff so she looks like the victim even if I talk to the admins - or even if I send them screenshots. Besides, she covers her shit with 'depression' and sad stories, so she just- she knows how to move on the strings to make me look like the bad guy and honestly if I just stand her is because of the characters I have with this other roleplayer who also is under her spell, so can't really ask her to rp the character elsewhere because they all are part of this group and outside the characters wouldn't entirely make sense.   \n\n\nI know, it's frustrating but I guess I just wanted to get it all out my chest because I just couldn't more - yesterday she straightly copied a character of mine who is really special to me and felt special because no one character in the group was like him but surprise, she copies all and his mannerisms. She didn't even change the way I describe my character in my replies, lol. And if I tell her or mention it to her? DRAMA. She'll deny it all, be bitchy to me, probably tell the admins I'm bullying her, and no thanks. But expressing it does makes me feel a bit better.",
