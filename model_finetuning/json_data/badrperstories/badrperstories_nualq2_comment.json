But the fact he's not upfront with his RP partners that he is, in fact, male, is gross. \n\nAnd if his gf doesn't know he's out there eRPing with random people... Look, my husband knows I eRP. As a pan woman, I love it. But I am ALWAYS up front with my husband about it. Otherwise, it's basically cheating. I can't imagine how his gf would feel about this either. \n\nBut yeah, he's not the kind of person you should put up with in your life. His behavior is not cool.

Does he like being a girl, or feel better acting like a girl, is it a mental tick, does he have a mental/sexual problem that makes him want to be lesbian online but be a strictly straight male IRL. Verdict: He belongs in the Circus for 8 years, forced to watch Jotaro x DIO hentai. Either that or is forced to admit this to his girlfriend, in all seriousness though you should say something to his girl, because it should be known how much of a clown he is.",
