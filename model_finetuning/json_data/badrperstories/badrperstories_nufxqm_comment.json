There are a hundred reasons why your writing styles might not be compatible and they aren't always because your skill levels are mismatched. It doesn't always mean that you think their writing is \"bad\" but if they choose to interpret it that way then that's on them and not on me. As I said further down in that comment, you don't owe anyone an explanation and can always block/unfriend them if they get upset. \n\nI am open to hearing alternate pitches for what to say, though. Your comment further down the page is all about insisting on samples up front so you know what you're getting into (which I completely agree with!) but you don't have any advice on what OP asked for- which is how to reply when someone sends a sample they aren't impressed by. What do you tell someone when you receive what you think of as a subpar sample?",

I don't think that this means that I don't value good grammar and writing in my roleplays. I just think that writing samples are super limited when it comes to determining how compatible I am with someone.\n\nAlso, I think that OPs post is about someone who has already send a sample and how you should handle the situation if you don't like the sample that was provided, so I don't really think that your advice is helpful in that situation. They already ask for samples and consider samples to be important, it is more about how one should handle a 'bad' writing sample in a polite way, or did I get that wrong?",

I (personally) never met someone who was great at all of these things and suddenly their writing style was complete garbage.\nMost of time, when I encountered roleplayers that were incompatible, the problem was more of stuff like: they don't write good interactions (not really reacting to my character, although the grammar etc. was good), people misrepresenting themselves and not keeping their promises (some of them even had writing samples on their profiles but in the roleplay, they suddenly wrote only 50 words and so on).\n I am not saying that writing samples can't help some people, I don't refuse to give one when people ask, and if you mention in your ad that you want one and the other person doesn't provide it or gets angry that is definitely a red flag. I am just saying that not everyone who doesn't ask for samples beforehand/has one in their profile automatically doesn't care for good writing and is bad writer.",
