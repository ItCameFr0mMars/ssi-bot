And, if you have RL happening then there\u2019s really nothing they can do but just be patient enough, but mainly understand that we all need a break to eat, chill, spend time with family ect. But if they spamming every few minutes or so ( at least i hope they werent OP) then that would drive anyone up a wall. Sure reminders on occasion are fine but; Most roleplayers can\u2019t be rping 24/7.",

I get that you\u2019re paraphrasing and making a long story short, but you\u2019re skipping some massively important context here. If they\u2019re complaining that you\u2019re inconsistent, then maybe you are. Idk, this wasn\u2019t very explanatory and you could both be idiots. But IMO, if you\u2019re responding at least twice a week, that\u2019s consistent. Less than twice a week would be hard to wait for, but twice a week or more is perfectly fine. If they\u2019re still calling you inconsistent after meeting that deadline, then you\u2019d be in the right to get upset with them.",
