Start to dislike something because XYZ happened in your play, etc.\n\nBut changing your OC each &amp; every post, without any kind of reason for that just sounds like bad RP for me personally. Unless their OC is known for having multiple personalities, undergone a makeover to change their looks, yada yada. But if none of those things happened, it just seems to me like those RPers haven't fleshed out their OC yet &amp; don't know where to go with them. I'd find it rather annoying ngl, because whenever they change their OC's character, the dynamics of your play will change.",

Lately it has been a more long term partner who has been attached to me.\n\nThe best examples I can think of is their character started out as a fiery tempered girl who as they put \u2018wears her heart on her sleeve\u2019. Only for the character to suddenly become crafty, sly, playful, and good at hiding her emotions. As well as them suddenly being uncaring a out other\u2019s opinions. Despite what they had originally been. This attitude became more apparent when they wanted to ship with a male character of mine who is more confident and classy.\n\nWhile the other character started out as a casual, boyishly cute flirty dude. Only for him to turn into a more feminine, cutesie shy guy. Which happened when they wanted to ship with a character of mine who displayed these traits (except shy).\n\nSo it almost feels as though they are tailoring their characters to be suited for mine, or even plot scenarios out of no where. But this makes them seem very different and confusing for my me and in roleplay because the change is so drastic and sudden every post. So I have not been able to really find myself enjoying it because I become stressed. Also they seem to ignore when I try to hint that things seem different.",

            "body": "Is it possible that your partner thinks that you want that personality change? When I still wrote romance more often, a lot of times when this happened it went like this: they constructed a character with a very distinct personality (for example a shy, quiet girl who was very naive and good hearted). I wrote something with my character like 'She is so quiet' or him thinking about how annoying a certain action she did was because she was so naive and trusted everyone. Suddenly, her character became very self-confident and cunning out of nowhere. This person just did not understand that minor disagreements did not mean that my character did not like hers (in fact, the combination of her character being good-hearted and shy and my character being cunning and extroverted made the relationship-dynamic interesting for me). Acting like this is often annoying/confusing, because suddenly all the interactions your characters already had feel wrong and invalid.\n\nIf I did not like shipping a certain character with one of her characters at all, I would tell her and suddenly she would make up ridiculous excuses why her character is different now / inventing a shared past or other stuff so that my reasons became invalid. This was very annoying, because sometimes I just didn't envision this specific character in a relationship, but when I said that she would be like 'everyone likes something, just tell me what he likes'. It did not feel realistic or organic at all.\n\nSome people are very insecure while roleplaying, and if a character finds a certain action to be 'annoying' or 'a lot of work' in character, they take this personally and think that I as a player want the plot to be different, which is untrue.",
