            "body": "Sure! This is a starter that I wrote up with my original character. She is surfing until she gets toppled over a few waves. She wakes up in an eerie looking cave where she meets a half man- half octopus who saved her life. What happens next? :) Hope you enjoy!   \n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to wait up for you?\u201d   \n\u201cI\u2019m sure! Don\u2019t even worry about me. You know I\u2019ve surfed alone countless times before.\u201d   \nMichael sighed before waving at Aya. \u201cFine, fine. Just please be careful. I\u2019ll see you at the party later then?\u201d   \nAya beamed a smile as she nodded, running to the ocean with her tan surfboard over her head. \u201cYou got it! See you later!\u201d She shouted. Michael rolled his eyes, chuckling before he walked off of the beach, hugging his white board against his hip before disappearing into the wooded parking lot. The sun setting painted the sky with its\u2019 natural red and pinkish hues. Dark clouds casted over the sky, but appeared to not threatened the mood.   \nThe ravenette ran quickly as fast as she could before throwing her board into the rolling waves and soon throwing herself on top of it. She paddled with her hands on her side as her eyes roamed over the beautiful sunset. This was great. A much-needed time to kick back and relax. She slowly steadied herself onto her feet as she started to ride one of a medium sized wave. Her hand dipped as she rode through the rolling tunnel, smiling brightly from ear to ear. She loved the ocean. If she had any power to do so, she wished she could just practically live it in and never leave. Just the thought of it made her heart skip a little. Her eyes suddenly widened as she saw an upcoming array of jagged sharp rocks. She quickly jumped off of her board and dove into the wave.  \n*Five minutes.* She quickly opened her eyes as she scampered through the waves and stuck her head out. She desperately tried to look to see where she was at before another wave toppled over her. She gritted her teeth as she swam furiously, trying to find a break point of the nonstop waves.   \n*Four minutes.* Her body was slammed down by a heavy rush of water, almost pushing her back against the rocks. Her black inky hair whipped through as she continued to hold her breath. Her eyes searched everywhere, but the force of the waves against the sand were so great that it started to fog her visibility.   \n*Three minutes.* Aya started to swim down, feeling her purple wetsuit clinging to her skin. It felt heavier than before, but she hadn\u2019t swum in the ocean for this long. Her cheeks were puffed out as little bubbles escaped the corner of her lips. The same current pushed her back once more before she spotted a dimly lit cave.   \n*Two minutes.* The pressure was starting to push deep in her chest as she swam faster towards the bottom. Her ears popped and she quickly stopped, covering them. No\u2026no..the cave was too far. Was the water starting to make her see things unclear? It was so close\u2026but yet so far.  \n*One minute.* Her body practically screamed for air, but she was so weak. So weak from fighting the waves. So exhausted from spending all day in the water. So cold\u2026the water was making her cold. Her body floated down thanks to the heavy weight of the wetsuit. Her hair veiled her face as her arms stretched out from side to side. Her lips parted as a few bubbles escaped, rising to the surface. Oh\u2026this was it. The welcoming abyss swallowing her open now.  \nHer eyes fluttered open as she stared up at a dark ceiling above her. '*Is this...is this Hell?'* She thought before she slowly turned her to the side, suddenly seeing a giant black tentacle. She immediately sprawled to her feet before being put back down on her knees as she coughed and hacked out the salt water that nearly filled her lungs. The salt water stung her eyes and mouth a bit before she tasted a familiar metallic taste. She winced as she wiped her nose, blood still leaking freely but the salt-water biting back. She glanced over at the half-man, half-octopus, her lips trembling. \u201cW-Who\u2026a-are you? W-Where am I?\u201d She asked.",

            "body": "I personally don't think that it is intimidating. Especially not for a starter. Starters imo should be rather long because it's what is supposed to serve as the intro and set the  first mood for an RP. It's a great engaging to read type of starter to me. I love the attention to detail and the liveliness in it.\n\nI however, do understand it can be intimidating to people who aren't so wordy, or confident in being able to write in the same descriptive manner. I think they tend to feel they are expected and required to meet the same standard. Even it's solely an expectation they put on them selves wanting to deliver. At least; people who are actually seriously wanting to do well-- because those who don't care to put any effort into an RP to begin with don't really matter anyway, as I see it. That's why I'm only talking about actual potential good partners that may get scared off due to feeling intimidated. \n\nMaybe they're afraid to disappoint. It's usually easier for people to write with someone they consider on their level or below. It makes them feel competent. No many want to feel pressure and as though they may fail when partaking in a hobby that's supposed to be relaxing. Not saying you mean to or are actually putting pressure on them by saying they have to match how you write or anything. But such type of feelings can definitely spark within a person as a result when intimidated by a post.\n\nI'm in the same boat as you where people often tend to say they are intimidated by my posts. I'm not happy about it either. It's led to me to often apologize whenever I drop a post that is long when I know it bothers them. Maybe that isn't a good thing but its actually helped. I think I may really feel worse about it than they do at that point. I tend to see plenty of flak going around in regards to people who write long posts too. So I don't feel like how I write is the best way. But it just so happens to be the most fun way for me to write. Regardless, I realise and acknowledge it can be considered not enjoyable by many. And since I'm a people pleaser I always aim for my partners to be happy with me and comfortable. \n\nSo, I tend to relay I feel bad and promise to try to keep my posts shorter when I know someone gets intimidated by it, but that I'm sorry if I can't. Because I just can't most of the time. I just don't enjoy to limit my own creativity. Like you, I simply can't make due with writing just a few lines. I want to paint a proper picture, evoke the atmosphere, emotions, give insight into my character's thoughts, etc. It's nothing to do with their posts being a problem. It's that I get bored if I can't write how I want. When they see I'm genuine they wind up saying it's okay. That it's not that they don't enjoy reading my posts. They just feel bad for not being able to write as much. Which sparks a much needed conversation that's helpful.\n\nThe goal being; If they can just let me write as I do without me feeling bad for it, as they hopefully can feel comfortable with how they write as well, then were good, basically. \n\nI think it's important to reach that mutual understanding. Because due to it, so far, I did not actually scare anyway away with it. I always press on the fact that I dont care about length but substance. As long as what they write makes sense and gives me something to work with, I'm pleased. I think the fact I show how I am genuinely getting where they come from and feeling bad for intimidating them, is what actually helps. It is what helps make them realize I'm not some kind of self-conceited hard ass who's confident that my writing is the best. That I am compassionate, reasonable, and don't have big demands. That, I am basically same as them. Someone humble who doubts their own skill too. Someone who simply wants to have fun. When people realize that, and that I'm very chill and not very demanding at all, they usually start to relax, and then I can relax too. And then we both wind up having a blast. That is definitely an added value about talking in OOC about these things. \n\nSo I don't know if you've tried this yet, but... perhaps making sure people know you're not, like, some elite type of person who demands the same back in return --I mean within reason of course, ya gotta get something worthwhile at least-- it may help a bit?",

It doesn't matter if you don't write as well or as much as someone, it's not a school assignment and the goal isn't to show off. It's to create a story with the added interest of someone else's creative input.

But this is just some food for thought)\n\nSome people I know add drama to every single reply. Nothing against it, really, but sometimes I want to write a simple scene where our characters get to know each other, without having something super surprising and shocking happening in every single reply. I think the plot has to be a little more calm so that the surprising effect when something unexpected happens in the next scene is more striking.\n\nAnd sometimes, I encounter people who write very interesting NPCs, like the character's sister/old school teacher/cool detective friend, which are super interesting to read. But if the whole reply (not talking about a starter, in a starter it's okay) is basically just a conversation between these characters and talking about how important they are for my partner's OC, with my character standing there and the only thing they can add is 'Okay, this plan sounds good' because everything else has already been said by the numerous NPCs, you start to wonder why your character even has to be present. Some people are so in love with writing and their NPCs, that they forget to give the other writer enough room to add something to the story. Sometimes they tell a story, rather than creating this story with their collaborative writing partner.\n\nThis can be very intimidating, and people who have bad experiences where their OC was basically just a secondary character in their partners OC's great story might notice red flags in your writing (even if they are not really there).",

It didn't have the character going off into a three paragraph long mental flashback to a memory long ago that the other person can't reply to but now is expected to match post length for, it didn't take ages talking about things that don't matter to the scene/can't be replied to, nor did it throw out five different dialogue pieces that all need a separate response IC and will end up fragmenting the conversation to an absurd degree that leaves the characters somehow juggling five conversations and four different actions that somehow fold into the other response like shuffling cards in a mobius time loop instead of leaving the scene as a back and forth between partners. (which I think can happen to all of us that write chunky replies sometimes, but god it can be annoying and ruin the flow/action of a scene)\n\nIn my experience the people who get told that their posts are 'intimidating' often enough for it to be a concern often have an inflated view of themselves and they don't realize they are actually just exhausting in a bad way. Their posts almost always are *excessively* long, they will never make a shorter response even when it fits because it doesn't suit the 'image' they are presenting, which means *everything* is just bloated all the time. You try and have a standard 'characters have a conversation' scene and end up needing to somehow fill 1k+ words of internal thoughts and shit in every post and it ends up really absurd really fast. They usually aren't open to criticism of their roleplay in these conversations, and it seems like they want reassurance that actually they are just super excellent and everyone else can't keep up, their posts just have so much more *life* etc. From your posted example I can't say if that ever applies to you, I can just say that your example there seems totally fine to me. \n\nSo honestly my take here, with the information you've given and assuming you're not a blowhard, is that you've either just had bad luck with partners, or you haven't properly expressed expectations and the amount of 'lit' the roleplay will be before you guys get started. Your ads can say 'novella, 2+ paragraphs' but I think that some people see that in a very different way, so with a new partner it helps to establish a baseline first so no one is surprised.",
