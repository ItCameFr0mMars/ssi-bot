            "body": "To me, this isn't really an example of being a bad RPer, assuming your friend approached you after you started this conversation, and you didn't create some false hope with this individual. Like others, I'd also be appreciative of this kind of honest response rather than being ghosted. Yes, it might be a little bit annoying or maybe even hurtful for some people, but I think it's up to the person on the receiving end to manage those feelings and respect your decision. Still, it's within their rights not to want to continue to engage with you after that, as well. \n\nI think I can understand why you wanted to 'keep yourself in check' after your last thread... like how you feel you wasted this person's time after venting about how people were wasting yours. But to me, this just shows that you're (generally) practicing what you preach. Which, again, I think is a good thing. That said though, I don't really see the connection between this example and your tone in your last thread. If you meant, \"I know I complained about people wasting my time, so here's me keeping myself in check by acknowledging I may have wasted someone else's\" - then sure, makes sense. It's good to be self-aware.\n\nHowever, I don't think it does much to rectify the fact that you were being purposefully abrasive and (in your words) a dick, just because you were angry. Of course, there's nothing wrong with how you felt or venting about your feelings - that's what this sub is for, after all. But if there is/was anything for you to keep yourself in check with, it's how you express these emotions, particularly in a public space. I don't think it's appropriate for *anyone* to be intentionally inflammatory just because they're upset. Especially towards people who are unrelated to the reason why that person is angry. \n\nDoes all that make you a bad RPer? Personally I don't think so, but it is an illustration of who you are as a person, which could affect how prospective RP partners see you. Now, it's not my intention to make things overly personal so that's all I'll say, but it's something to reflect upon if you're open to it.",
