I will never forget when my best friend and I started our first roleplay I admitted to her that I had started to cry during a sad bit. She admitted the same. I think the connection we feel through writing is the same way we get connected to a character in a film, television show, game, or book. Roleplay is a nice escape from the real world, for a little while you can experience adventure or whatever story you're writing. I think your problem is that you need a partner who has the same interests as you. If only one partner is interested in a storyline it falls apart. Roleplay is collaborative for a reason.",

You say you're able to separate yourself from your characters, so as long as it's not impacting your mood for the worse (beyond a few minutes when something intense is happening in the RP), you should be fine!\n\nThe key is to find someone to write with who is just as excited as you are. That's where the magic happens. When you say you notice your current partner isn't excited, even though they're participating, it makes me think their lack of enthusiasm is translating into lackluster RP for you. You should seek other partners who have the same passion for your story and characters! It's so worth it.\n\nYou don't have to drop your current partner, but maybe a small break or asking what their dream RP looks like will help out.",
