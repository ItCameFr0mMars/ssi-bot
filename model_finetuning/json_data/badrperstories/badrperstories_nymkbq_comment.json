I just think sometimes when we are in that situation we tend to think of it as 'I wish they would just SAY they don't want to roleplay with me anymore!' when I don't think it's that 'clean' and simple on their end. \n\nIt's very frustrating and I hope you find someone dependable soon.",

I posted some ads in Discord servers, made some reach-outs, done a couple of planning, everything was good and THEN this whole thing turned into a cocktail of events about people losing interest, giving half-hearted replies after leaving me on-read for days and eventually ghosting me.   \n\n\nI can wait for a week without response and I even gave them time before it all went to shit, but sometimes you gotta make the decisions yourself and end the RP. Which I did a couple of times and they got upset at me for not waiting a little longer. Truth is, I'm tired of waiting on people giving me shit replies without much effort input.  \n\n\nFrankly, OP, I can feel your struggle. Although I truly enjoy writing, I start to feel like I need to take a break, or even leave the role-play community as a whole because of how shitty and toxic it is.",

RPers are constantly using mental illnesses as an excuse for rude behavior and ghosting without communication, and that is not okay.  And I say that as a person with depression and anxiety who has had to end rp because of bad patches with my mental health and ability to cope.  Those issues do not stop a person from saying they need to stop.  It makes dealing with an angry response harder, but we are still adults.  Some people just don't accord an internet person the courtesy they would a person in front of them, and they don't want to try.  Maybe that sounds harsh, but I've been roleplaying for years now and I have run across just so many of these people. \n\n I just had a partner who needed to stop for irl health reasons, and he's going through a lot, and he still let me know.  Anyone can let the person know.  People on BadRperStories are like \"but sometimes we don't because they're a psychopath who would hound us forever,\" but we all know that is not what most partners who get ghosted are like.",

I think if someone leaves you dangling, whatever their reason, you should move on. Life happens and you can take it situationally if they come back later and talk to you about things, but too many people get stuck waiting in limbo and it blows. \n\nI was just saying that sometimes people think 'they don't want to roleplay with me' when in my experience at least many of those people probably 'want' to, but still for whatever personal reason or motivations, don't or can't seem to. It's still important to move on regardless, even if it isn't a case of them 'not wanting to', because the end result is the same when you're the one left in the lurch. \n\nIn my opinion it is often (but not always) a case of priorities. The person 'wants' to roleplay with you, but they 'want' other things a little more so those things happen first and you're left waiting and waiting.",

You guys are just functioning on different pace.\n\nFor you it's more thrilling to RP, while ideas are still fresh and interesting. Other people have to resort to very slow, but stable RP. I can and will play very actively, I enjoy it, but if I knew I have to do it all the time or get a boot, I would feel more pressured, than interested.\n\nMy partners not only know and accept that, it happens to be, that our schedules fit together really well, and we are comfortable and happy about our RP. I wouldn't have it any other way. Even if sometimes it's just me dropping by and telling everyone I can't wait to RP with them again. For weeks.\n\nBut what is good for one's mental health is poison for the other's. Have you ever tried to set basic timeframe ground rules in your ad/bio? That way more people with the same pace will gravitate towards you.",
