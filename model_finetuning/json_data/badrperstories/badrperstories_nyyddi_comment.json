            "body": "Writing is so subjective it's really hard to say. I think most people don't want to consider themselves a \"bad\" writer. It's unfortunate, but I don't know if there is any real way to \"fix\" it. In my experiences, I just kept writing as I usually write, and I would notice my partner attempt to try and match me. I could see that they were at least trying to put in the effort. I had one partner who ask if I could help her write out some scenes/give feedback because she wanted to improve and I was perfectly okay with that. \n\nI think it's just the lazy ones who want to essentially read a book, are the ones that are difficult to deal with. One trend that I've noticed is to just reply to ads/posts that people put in a lot of effort into. *Most* times, I've seen that these people put in a little more effort into their writing as well.",

            "body": "I would ... Oof. I'm a stickler for words. English is my third language, but it's the cultural differences that get me, so I take words at their literal meaning more often than not. If someone promised me 3 paragraphs per post but then only gave two sentences as \"paragraphs,\" I would not be gentle with how I deliver the definition of a paragraph, in that it is typically 3 - 5 sentences, therefore their \"paragraphs\" are incomplete. What they've given is 1.5 paragraphs at best, and respectfully, no thank you.\n\nIn that, it's less about the writing standards and more about the lying for me. I also get a little bit of a chuckle when someone describes their writing as \"literate.\" Because the *literal* definition is just \"(of a person) able to read and write.\" Technically, a five year old is literate. That's not the flex people think it is. Yes, I know, context. In RP, literate means they don't believe their farts stink because they can turn a pretty phrase. It's still just very silly to me.\n\nAs of a month ago, I've been role playing for 20 years. I remember the rise of Elitists on AOL. I remember the Guild Trends, Rhy'din, Red Dragon Inn, and the Hufflepuff Hangout. I remember being bullied out of spaces because I wasn't \"literate\" enough for them. I remember practicing writing in the Slytherin Social, so I could fit in with the \"cool kids\" of Vampire City. I've role played across Facebook, Rolepages, Roleplay.me , Yahoo, AoL, fucking Neopets, and Elliquiy. Now I'm on Discord. I've held my own with purple prose heavy-weights, and I've vibed with the one-liners. All of that experience has taught me that everyone who role plays meets the requirement of literacy, and length doesn't mean a cotdamn thing. I've had partners who give me 9 pages of introspective fluff that I can't do a thing other than wipe my ass with. I've had partners who give me 1 paragraph with enough context to ignite my muse. Length is nothing. Content is key.",

They'd send a paragraph of 3-5 sentences at times, but they'd be full of writing or grammar mistakes and missed punctuation, which to me does not say literate.\n\nNever mind the purple prose and fluff phenomenon where people shove needless details into a post to make up for their lack of actual content, so they meet length requirements because that seems to be what matters. I care more about style and quality over length usually--if you send me 3 sentences and they involve action, reaction or something in direct response to my last post then I don't care it was short, at least I'm getting somewhere.\n\nBut if you're going to tell me you write in novella and that novella is lacking in the most basic grammar and writing features such as commas for dialogue, proper tense, cutting down run on sentences and knowing when to break your script, then I'm sorry you are not literate or novella, you're key smash.\n\nMaybe we just need new vocabulary? Literacy literally refers to reading/writing ability on a functional level, not length. If we switch to something like Micro, Short, Medium, Long, Extra Long, Term Paper, etc and keep it separate from style then maybe people could be more specific in what they can do and want. Then do style as Script or Story (asterisks or written prose) and then you have something.",

We have enough divide in this community, why use such absolute statements to divide further?  As you can see, others have had different experiences than you; I cannot say I have ever felt bored writing my responses, and I get excited to read when it sent to me, and when you have the right partner they flow well.

Some writers want to take time with the scene and the setting, others will want to devote more attention to emotional tension or action, and some want the whole package all the time; focusing on post length as a gauge of writing ability only places pressure on everyone without providing an agreed upon structure beyond \u201cdetailed and literate\u201d as if that is a specific request. \n\nPersonally I like to have a solid setting and a good physical understanding of the scene, beyond that, I\u2019m not super picky about what details get added on as long as there is a smattering of dialogue and emotional content thrown in. For some partners, this has worked great, while others have wanted more dialogue and emotion without changing post length. Less is more, absence of extraneous description leaves emphasis on what\u2019s being explored.\n\nYou can throw in every conceivable detail and call it done, but if that overwhelms your partner, leaving them confused about what to respond to in your novella of information, you might as well be writing alone.",
