            "body": "If you're consistently getting the same feedback, it's probably true. It might be better to stick to simpler ideas, with less background and lore. Get a feel for what the average roleplayer/community is looking for and try to match it. Sure, you can keep going with your complicated things, and search solely for partners who can meet you on an equal footing, but that's probably going to be really frustrating for you, imo. \n\nJoining a fleshed-out existing setting can be intimidating, especially when it's been in development for over a year. That's a great accomplishment for you as a worldbuilder, but there's probably too much information to digest at once for the average stranger on the internet. Also, in general, I've seen that people are less interested in a setting where most/all things are settled - they want to be able to contribute and shape the world. That might be another factor.",

            "body": "For many people (like me), it is very important that I can shape the world me and my roleplay partner create together. If a roleplay already has very detailed lore, it can be super overwhelming. Not only that, it also severely limits the characters I can create for the roleplay. I don't know you (personally), but a lot of times when my partner offered me a very detailed world to write in, all my ideas for the world or my characters where met with 'Nah, (detail about world that I couldn't know), therefore this idea for the background/abilities/etc. for your character won't work. You can do (...) instead.' So I ended up with characters which were either very basic or fit an image that my partner had in mind, but not really with characters I found interesting. Or the worldbuilding was really so convoluted and complicated that I felt that I would have to read a whole novel to understand how the world works. Dumping large amounts of info on your roleplaying partner and expecting that they will understand everything you have planned in a year in a very short will probably not work very well, especially if you don't leave enough space for them to add their own\n\nideas.\n\nAlso: the more details a story/world has, the more likely it is that one of these details will be a no-go for your (future) roleplaying partner or just something they don't have much interest in writing. Sometimes, I read a very basic summary of a story and think 'Wow, that is a roleplay I might want to write.' and then I talk about it with the person who wrote the search, and it turns out that they want to include crime story elements, which is not really my thing, or detailed description of slavery (or whatever topic I am not interested in writing). That is just normal, it happens.",
