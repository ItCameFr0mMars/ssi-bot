There was this one guy I would roleplay with who I think was 16 or 17\u2013definitely older than me and wanted to RP romance with one of my female characters. As a very young kid, I didn\u2019t have a lot of interest in romance so I\u2019d occasionally have her brother appear to interact with his character. Well, one day the brother and his OC got into a fight and his character accidentally pushed the girl into some sort of portal with  no exit. Then he was surprised when I decided to go along with his canon that she was gone forever. Like major Pikachu face vibes here\u2014I don\u2019t know what he was expecting!",

Chucking a bunch of preteens/teens into a creative setting like that naturally led to a lot of interesting experiences. I could fill an entire subreddit with every story I remember about people with no grammar or who godmodded/autohit/metagamed like no tomorrow.\n\nGroup started a real-time combat round while I was asleep. I came back to my character having been beaten up and thrown out of the IC faction, and I was expected to play them as a loner in the group's vicinity. I was also expected to have no problem with this. Surprised pikachu all around when I quit instead.\n\nSomeone wanted to play out a romance. Sure! After about 20, maybe 25 posts, they suddenly started referring to our characters as siblings and had edited their character's past flirting out of their posts. They never answered me when I asked them what was going on and why they'd changed the relationship.\n\nOne of my first 1x1s was with a person who wanted their two serial killers to hunt and kill my character, and I think turn her into some kind of ghost or vampire? Both their characters were adults and mine was \\~16, iirc.\n\nYour average everyday medieval roleplay, where a plucky band of adventurers finds a princess in the forest and escorts her back to their town. Until one of the players decided to write that a dragon showed up and started torching characters. The players were not pleased at the sudden barbecue, to say the least, the group's GM least of all. The resulting screaming and drama tanked the rp.",
