            "body": "A better question is who doesn't? At least in terms of *good* RP partners, they overlap quite a bit with good world builders, and anyone that's had to build something from scratch knows good world building isn't just a list of gods and some lore for plot, with a few odd terms thrown in for jargon flavor.\n\nAnd that doesn't even mean a full world build either; even on realistic mechanical level, going message by message, you want to be able to accurately paint a picture and maybe pick up a few new words (I recently replaced 'blood' with 'carotic fluid' and it changed the text flavor a bit) to set the tone. No one wants to have a partner that, without reason, fails to take damage after falling 3 stories onto a truck bed or start losing fingers to paper cuts because they have no grasp on damage or reasonable fragility of a meet sack that thought diving out the window would be a great idea.\n\nWhat are the risks? How fast do they have to go? What type of window was it? How likely are they to nick a vein on shattered glass? Did they just bounce off the window because they didn't go fast enough? Do department stores have bullet proof windows that a human can't break down in their own?\n\nAll those factors can make or break a plan and affect how the story goes. People that skip over those details or complain about realism in real world settings or plots just get tiresome because they want to glory, not the story.\n\nThat lack of detail is why I passed up an RP idea someone posted about being a beloved prince marrying the daughter of the enemy to bring peace, but there's a coup brewing. I asked if there were any ideas on why there was a war or what the coup was about, or if I could offer some and they said it didn't matter and they didn't really care because it wasn't super important to them. I took that as they wanted a glory story where they save the day and not as a court intrigue story with possible magic shenanigans\n\nResearch matters. Especially because it can help you catch people and call their BS when they try to powergame or technobabble to get their way.",
