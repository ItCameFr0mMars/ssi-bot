Most Rpers with that age gap aren't going to want to do one on one for reasons besides nsfw - emotionally leaning on a kid as an adult is bad for them, tmi subject matter etc.  Not to say you're worse than this girl here, just that the \"well its just a liiittle bit underage and what they dont know doesnt hurt them\" doesn't pan out in reality.\n\nAnyway.  Yeah, it sounds like she shot for someone with an eight year age gap for reasons of 'this person will be less familiar with my brand of weird shit' then pulled a cruel discard instead of breaking it off like an adult when pushing and whining didn't get her what she wanted.  I'm in my late twenties and wouldn't shoot for heavy one on one plots with a newly minted 18 year old either, it's a bit too weird.  Sorry this girl was an ass to you, I think you could still talk with your mum in the sense of 'yeah so weirdfriend got weirder and became weird ex-friend, feeling bummed out about it'.",

Although it was a shitty thing I did, there was definitely worst things (I remember one of the people in my old servers doing a sexual rp with a 13 year old who lied about being 18). I did tell my mom about it and just lied about the circumstances but she didn\u2019t really understand. However, I did got help through other online friends so it panned out in the end. I definitely think she took advantage with my naiveness and just discarded me when I pushed back and figured out that I wasn\u2019t going to bend to her every will. I can\u2019t even imagine rping with someone younger than 19 now. Oh",
