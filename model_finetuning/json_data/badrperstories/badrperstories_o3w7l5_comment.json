I'm not saying everyone's inevitably homely, but a lot of us are, or have a disability, or suffer from depression and anxiety,  or some combination.\n\nI'm not saying he absolutely is the one for you, or that you should date him or anything.

            "body": "I find writing to be a personal experience in one on one situations. I hate to admit it but I know over time, I tend to develop strong feelings for my partners (sometimes romantic, sometimes platonic) but I believe it's because writing can be a personal bond for people to connect and develop, that it can happen and there's nothing wrong about it. It's how those feelings are handled, that can have either positive or negative consequences.\n\nI also feel that when writing romance based plots, it's a risk that one might attach feelings from in-character writings (not necessary first person POV either) to that in outside-of-character discussions. For many, RPing is easy to do on the go too, so it's easier to chat during the day and connect at a more personal level than just popping in once in a while to write something. Add the fact you can share pictures, music, and other media with one another, it opens up a gateway to friendships forming quickly, sometimes quicker than offline.\n\nI think if you want to hold onto the roleplay, you need to give yourself time to separate the partner and their character. You've built up an expectation in your head (which is fine!) but him opening up to you about his appearance isn't exactly his fault and you need to accept that before you can move on, at least emotionally. I would focus on sticking to RP-related discussions and keep things more 'formal' for a few weeks. You should still be friendly of course but it may be better if you began to detach from the ideas you've developed and begin to build up a tolerance for these lingering feelings of attraction and subsequent disappointment. He didn't meet what you envisioned. That's okay. But you need to begin to change how you asses your relationship. You can be friends?\n\nI would give it time. You need time to process the new information and to tell yourself your affection can be strictly platonic. You need to respect the story you've both created too, and if you fear you can't, then you need to walk away. But I still think you need to give yourself time and tell yourself, 'He's not what I expected and that's fine. I can now move on emotionally and enjoy our story without any distractions of unmet expectations.' And keep telling yourself this, write it down and in time you'll believe it and you may even get back to a comfortable level without any romantic undertones. \n\nI can see your side and his side easily because I've been in both positions. In your position, I've felt guilty for getting attached too quickly but I've also been able to recover and give myself time to move on while focusing on our RP more than the man behind the screen. If you want, you might be able to confess how you're feeling and ask him to give you space if you want it or an 'out' if he wants it too, as I'm sure his gesture made him feel vulnerable and maybe he knows he's not a common 'type' for some people. I confessed to a RPer (after we swapped pics and had been writing for over a year, even got each other b-day gifts) and he was so sweet and let me down so nicely, I was even more conflicted. But I told him I would on myself and would like to still write if he wanted to, despite knowing my feelings. I don't think I was his type and we've since parted ways, but there was a time after my confession, that things did appear to go back to normal. So it's possible to move on from your current feelings associated with the writer and story. But it's also possible that this could be the end for your partnership, either due to discomfort or interest that can no longer be resuscitated. \n\nI feel for both of you in this situation.\n\nWriting is a way to connect to people and catching feelings isn't out of the ordinary.\n\nBut like writing and plotting together, these feelings can take on a life of their own if left unchecked. \n\nI'm in the school of thought that if you like someone and you've talking/writing for 6+ months and have seen pictures and are somewhat close, then speak up. Life is too short to mute your feelings. For all you know, they feel the same. But it comes with a risk of ruining things.\n\nBut others prefer to swallow their feelings, if they have any, and keep writing and actual emotional connections, separate. That makes sense too, as it might be less complicated.\n\nI kinda rambled a lot but I'm kinda into this guy I'm writing with (and perhaps like your RP partner isn't a common 'type' in the conventional means) so I guess I kind of needed to let some of my own stuff out. But again, I've also been in your shoes and I know it's tough. If this just happened within a few days, give yourselves time and communicate as much as you want to but I would say it's better to be honest and work through the awkwardness, than leave someone in the dark. And if either of you walk away, I hope it's as amicable as possible. :)",
