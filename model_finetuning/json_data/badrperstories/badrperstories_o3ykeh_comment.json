I think it's important to let yourself mourn the loss and come to terms with the roleplay being over.  I personally find it helpful to write out a satisfying ending to the story and then shelve the character.\n\nFinding new partners after losing a wonderful long term one is usually pretty discouraging.  It always takes me months to find a good partner.  It really can be a numbers game out there.  You roll the die and hope to luck out.  You probably will go through a lot of bad partners before finding another good one.\n\nThe hardest, but most important thing is to not compare your new partners and stories to the old one.  Don't try to replicate what you had.  It's never going to be the same and you'll just end up disappointed.  You won't find another partner like them, but you can find a partner you like just as much.  It will be a different experience, not a worse one.",

            "body": "Suggestion: offer a break. Keep each other\u2019s contract info, tell them no pressure to respond, but make it very clear that if they ever change their mind, just to message you and you\u2019ll be back, either to continue or start something new. There is a solid chance this is temporary! But that temporary might be *long*. Like, a year long, or even more. Writing takes a lot of creative energy, and no one feels it always, but many people get the itch to roleplay again after a while. If you leave that door open, it may not be over.\n\nHow do I know this? Experience. I have a roleplay partner I am well past 5 years with. We have *both* done this. Sometimes *you just need a break*. We\u2019ve both poofed (sometimes with notice, sometimes with no notice) for months at a time. The reason we have lasted is the other person does. Not. Care. We know they will be back sometime. I honestly think one of the keys to a long term partnership is making sure the other person does not feel bad and is able to come back after they\u2019ve been gone awhile. It\u2019s the main reason I have ghosted (in the past, I am much better about this then I use to be, I suck it up and send more ooc messages when this happens so I don\u2019t just \u201cghost\u201d). I get busy or have no creative energy and keep telling myself that I\u2019ll do it tomorrow. It\u2019s not on purpose, I don\u2019t sit down and decide to disappear, I just keep pushing it back another day. And then a week or two, or even a month, passes, and even when I have time and energy again \u2014 I feel too bad to message them because I just assume they are upset. I\u2019ve decided that sucking it up and letting *them* tell me is the better plan. I don\u2019t need to make decisions for them because I\u2019m afraid of their reaction.\n\nSo, yeah. Offer a break. Make sure they know you aren\u2019t upset that they\u2019ve been slow (only if you truly aren\u2019t upset about that; don\u2019t lie), and that the door is always open if they change their mind. You two can keep up ooc in the meantime if that is something you both enjoy, or drop that too.\n\nAnd then, like the other person said, search for a new partner but try not to compare everyone to them.",

If you go searching right now, you'll be comparing everyone to this ideal partner, whether you realize it or not - and they'll all be falling short. After some time has passed, start working on an ad and looking for places to put it. \n\nTake it slow once you do share your ad. You probably won't match with the majority of people. This past year has been the worst time I've ever had trying to find partners, and I've been roleplaying eleven years. \n\nWhere were you searching for roleplays before? You might have better luck branching out to different platforms. I've found Discord to be the best place to search. I've tried Reddit and a couple of 1x1 forums but never found anyone I really meshed with.",

My first-ever serious RP (as in, multi-paragraph/literate, consistent responses, that kind of thing) lasted for a year or two and I was so, so invested in it, as was my partner. We had written about 90k words total, would send memes to each other about our characters and share headcanons, etc. Had so many plans for the plot. But then life stuff happened for me and I had to quit for a long time, and by the time I came back, things had pretty much fizzled out. Now she was the one who was too busy for RP. We just weren\u2019t on the same wavelength anymore and eventually drifted away.\n\nI\u2019ve been searching for \u201cThe One\u201d for months now that I\u2019m back into RP, but it\u2019s been pretty unfruitful so far. I have a few partners I enjoy roleplay with, but not one that clicks as well as that specific one did. Just\u2026 nothing is the same. It\u2019s like something is missing. Augh, getting frustrated even as I type this!\n\nHonestly, the only advice I can give is to just keep searching. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll have a chance. Be very specific in your RP ads if you\u2019re looking for a certain thing, don\u2019t be afraid to let people know if it isn\u2019t working out - don\u2019t burn all your energy forcing something that isn\u2019t there.
