            "body": "Honestly, you don't sound like a bad roleplayer to me. Just one with self-esteem issues and a lack of experience in developing characters and dynamics, who's hit burnout. Being slow is nowhere near a bad thing, by the way. It's just part of how you roleplay. I'd venture to say that only sharing when asked is part of your rp 'style' too and not a fault, too, though of course that can depend on whether or not that reluctance makes plotting difficult.\n\nIf creativity isn't happening, there's nothing wrong with taking a break. Or even stopping roleplaying altogether and moving on to other hobbies! Honestly, I think burnout and lack of muse/interest is a much more common thing than most people acknowledge. Trying to force things to happen will just result in a frustrated and demotivated writer, not a surprise new fountain of creativity and ideas.\n\nYou may want to google tips for writing deeper characters and different dynamics, if that's something you're having trouble developing on your own. There are a lot of resources out there. And ones for general fiction/novel writing can be just as valuable as ones for roleplaying. I've never met a roleplay who didn't start with shallow, cringy OCs. Learning how to write better characters can be a lot of work and take a lot of time, it's certainly possible!\n\nAs for your roleplay partner... If I understand your post correctly, she's threatening to end your friendship if you take a break from roleplaying rather than cater to her wants? Nothing's worth that kind of pettiness and manipulation. And saying she's *stuck with you* is just... shitty. This person is not your friend in any meaning of the word. You need to cut things off with her and move on. Sounds like a toxic, one-sided relationship.\n\nHonestly, if your relationship is only continuing because of what you can give to her, she's just using you, and it's bound to fall apart sooner or later. No wonder you're having trouble writing and being excited about roleplay! If someone I considered a friend treated me like this, I wouldn't be able to write a word. End your relationship with this person, take some time away from roleplay to work on fleshing out and developing your characters, and wait to return to posting until you genuinely enjoy it again.",

            "body": "As u/furtivefloofer said, you don't seem to be a bad role player at all. Maybe just a little burnt out, and if role playing has become more of a chore for you than a hobby, then I understand your frustration. When ANYTHING becomes less of something fun to do and more you HAVE to do, then in my opinion, it's time to stop, have a good hard look at it, and take a break. \n\nEveryone has a particular style, and everyone improves one way or another. I know how you feel about self-esteem issues; no matter how much effort I put in a character, I feel satisfied, then I take a second look and I scratch my eyes out. It happens. But at the same time, we all have different styles, pacings, and creativity rushes, and you shouldn't feel bad about it.\n\nAnd because we all have different styles, you shouldn't compare to her, or other role players, because think about it; let's say you start copying her. As in similar ideas, writing length and style... would it work? If you don't feel comfortable writing in a similar manner, it means it just not fits right with you, which means you don't have to change; you can only improve over time. \n\nEven when I don't role play, I constantly tinker with my characters, plots and ideas, to keep my muse from dying out, and at the same time I think of ways to improve myself bit by bit. I also play video games or read books and that gives me all sorts of ideas : backstories, names, meanings, personalities; it does help me a lot, and I hit author blocks pretty often. \n\nAlso regarding your rp partner... even if she's an amazing writer... if she threatens to break off your friendship just because you feel unable to continue anymore and you need a break, I don't think you can call that a friendship anymore, and I don't think you could lose anything for breaking ties with her. If she's that amazing, she should be not only understanding of you, but also helpful. If she's that good, she should help you rise you up, not put you down and burn you out. \n\nThat's my take on it, anyway, if any of my ramblings made sense. If you ever need help with characters, I'm more than happy to brainstorm together; we can all gather and chat about stuff like these with whoever's up for it, two or multiple heads work better than one imo. \n\nThat being said, I hope you'll get better and work things out, either with her or with your lady muse. Either way, I really think you deserve a nice break for yourself to relax and take a big breath of fresh air away from all this stuffiness. ^^",

            "body": "I think there's three things happening here that need to be addressed.   \n\n\nThe first is that your muse needs a break. Pure and simple. It happens to all of us. I can usually power through muse issues, but what I churn out is uninspired and if I do that for too long, it's like I sprain my muse muscle. You can only force it for so long before, like you said, it feels like work and not a hobby. When RP stops being the escapism we seek, then it's not worth doing anymore and you end up doing more harm than good.   \n\n\nThe second issue is that she is not letting you take the break you need. She might well be a fantastic writer, but she sounds like a toxic partner. She's withholding friendship from you based on writing together. That's arguably not a real friend, if her friendship is conditional upon you giving her what she wants, especially when doing so is hurting you and you've expressed that. I'd argue SHE is the bad role player here. Roleplaying isn't JUST writing, it's collaborating. She's not doing that. There's also the fact that she's actively made sure you know that there's people in your group that she has better chemistry with and feels \"stuck\" with you. That is toxic, pure and simple. She's trying to bait you and make you jealous. She's manipulating you into feeling insecure. It's like that expression \"before you diagnose yourself with depression, make sure you're not just surrounded by assholes first.\" She sounds like an asshole.   \n\n\nLastly, it sounds like you've been paired only together for the last 6 years. Part of role playing is experiencing other styles of writing. After 6 years, you should know her muse and her mind pretty well. It might be that the reason you're struggling so much is that she's a bad match for you now and you've outgrown her. I would suggest that before you fully quit RP altogether, you find a different partner and try writing with them a bit. It really sounds like it's not so much RP that you need a break from, it's her. Finding a new mind to mesh with might inspire you. If that doesn't work, then yeah, take a hiatus, or quit altogether if that's what makes you happy.",
