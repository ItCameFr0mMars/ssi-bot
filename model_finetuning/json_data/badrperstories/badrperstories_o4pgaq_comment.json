            "body": "Lots of great advice here already so I'll just add on to it.\n\nIf you really want to keep the story you already have in tact, you can still use the other person's OCs in your character's background so long as you're not playing them as your own.  Figure out a reason why their time together ended and what your character has been doing off-screen since then.   Then RP the next chapter of your character's life.  Change their characters' names and maybe tweak a few things about them.  You can even make a new character based on theirs.  Just don't rp them.  Leave them behind in the backstory when you start your new rp.\n\nFor instance, I had a failed rp with a knight character who was heading towards a romantic relationship with another knight.  I loved the way the relationship influenced her.  So, next time I played her with someone new, I changed it so instead of a romantic interest, he was a platonic mentor that inspired her.  I had another with a mage and her swordsman sister.  The person playing her sister had to stop rping due to RL.  So, then I had my character get accepted into a magic school where her sister couldn't follow and went from there.  \n\nAs other people said, AUs are awesome and can get you to enjoy a character in new ways.  I'd highly suggest trying it.",

            "body": "I've run into this with a few OC's that were basically forged in the fires jointly with another person's OC. I have a hard time writing one of them still due to various issues, sadly, but what helped was taking a long break from the OC to focus on other things while also giving the OC a makeover in both story and looks when I picked them up again.\n\nThere are some OCs I sort of 'retire' from roleplaying, though. I don't know if I will ever pick them up again, but in my mind currently they are too tied to the character I wrote them with so I shelved them and made new OCs. It's sad, and I miss the characters sometimes, but it felt so much better getting a 'fresh start' than it did trying to cling and force a character to work that just wasn't working.\n\nSome people will basically reskin the other person's OC as an 'ex' in the character's past (new name, some details changed etc) as well, but if I was a new roleplayer picking up with a person's OC and I found out that was attached to the OC I would feel uncomfortable, so take that with a grain of salt. Some people wouldn't mind that at all, others would rather not have the baggage. (I am not saying you can't use the OC again here though, just that some people prefer to not have the shadow of past roleplay partner's characters *in* the roleplay itself basically. My current partner has a few characters that she 'recycled' for us to use together, and I have one as well, but they are basically brought into the plot/rp 'fresh'.)\n\nIf I ever lose my current partner it would be a bit of a mess since we have an entire herd of characters that I am attached to and most of them I built *with* her and her characters in mind (with her doing the same towards my characters), but such is the roleplaying life. \n\nBasically my advice would be to salvage what you can, if you can, while separating/cutting out the other person's OCs from their past, and set aside the rest. Take the 'core' of your character and keep that while etch-a-sketch shaking away all plotlines that happened with your past roleplay partner.",
