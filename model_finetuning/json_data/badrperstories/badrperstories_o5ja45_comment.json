            "body": "I'm really sorry to hear that you've had such a string of bad experiences with ghosters. It can be very frustrating, demoralizing, and exhausting - especially when you've gotten invested in the roleplay. Unfortunately, like it's been said, this is problem is just kind of a norm in the community. I'm not sure there's much that any of us can do about it, except leading by example and being good communicators ourselves.\n\nI can't speak for all the reasons why your RP partners decided to ghost, but I can say that you being understanding and respectful is not wrong. I can see how it feels like a downfall to be too kind or too patient, and it truly sucks to feel like people can take advantage of it and walk all over you. And in some certain situations, I think you do need to set boundaries to protect yourself from that. But generally, if someone is telling you they're having a hard time, I feel that being kind and understanding is the better choice. At least, in your response to them - if you don't believe it, like in that example you mentioned, that's valid too in my opinion. In such a case, it's fair to kind of remove/detach yourself from things if someone is that flaky.\n\nSomething I'm finding with age and experience is that, while it's great to be enthusiastic, passionate, and engaged in RP, I feel it's helpful (important, even) to have a certain degree of healthy detachment to offset that. I think it helps to ground yourself in reality and protect your feelings a bit more. This isn't easy, especially since RP is so heavy on the escapism, but I think it helps with getting ghosted, burned, etc. by others.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example - I've been effectively ghosted by someone who was pretty much a perfect partner on paper, both as RPers and as individuals. Our RP was quite promising with a good amount of worldbuilding, a complex and ambitious plot, multiple characters and storylines, etc. It started off pretty well but dwindled because of real life problems. Like you, I always give them the time and space they need and offer support if they want it. Long story short, I've had no replies from them for 2-3 months now so it's pretty safe to say it's done. Sounds kind of devastating on paper to lose someone I was so compatible with, and I was definitely disappointed to a degree. But I just tried to remind myself that this is a hobby and this has no major repercussions on my real life or well-being (which are what's really important). I thought about the time I now have free to do other things instead. And I didn't feel so bad as I thought I would.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if that's helpful at all to you, but I wanted to share in case maybe you got some insights from it. Again, I know it's probably much easier said than done.\n\nRegardless, in terms of quitting - maybe you can just take a break. It sounds like you're pretty burnt out (understandably so) and I think if RP is creating anxiety and stress for you, it's not healthy or beneficial to continue for the time being. Maybe you can do some private writing instead as an outlet for yourself. It's wonderful that writing has done so much for you, and I don't see any reason why you need to quit it altogether. Just take out the collaborative part and see how that goes. I know it's not the same as RPing, but maybe it'll still scratch the itch anyway. You can always come back to RPing down the road if you find yourself in a better headspace.\n\nSorry for the long post. Best of luck to you!",

So when they inevitably burn themselves out and lose interest, they vanish. \n\nI know this happens because I struggle a little with this. And I know a few people I've role-played with in the past who've either experienced this or have done the same thing themselves. It's very common for people to take more on than they can, and that can be said for basically anything.",
