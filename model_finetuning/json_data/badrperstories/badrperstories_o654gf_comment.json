            "body": "What you may need is to try and to create your own RP space, be it a server, a forum, SNS group, chat or something else. It still baffles me tbh, but when you are in charge, it makes bigger difference, than it's logically should.\n\nFor one, it's much easier to make unspoken rules. Like treating your RP team-mates with respect, being open and upfront about your time and plans, discussing mutual wishes and having fun. \n\nThis way RP dies, when you let it to. No earlier. Because people will come and go way more  naturally, and you won't be helpless about it. You will be the one to decide, what people even belong to your team to begin with. It may take a while to create a comfortable and safe atmosphere, but it will be so worth it.\n\nRP is just a hobby, but as any hobby, it can play in important part of your life and a great source of comfort. You are doing it to unwind, to create something beautiful, to interact with people and their characters. \n\nYou are not RPing to feel unhappy and left out. So, in the future it's better not to put yourself in situation, where your happiness and comfort about your favourite thing solely depend on whims of some random strangers.\n\nAnd regarding these three RPs of yours, my advice would be not to lose hope just yet, but still make necessary precautions. \n\n1) Save all the text in a file. All of it;\n\n2) Copy your post and concepts in different file;\n\n3) Fill the blanks other people's characters leave in that text. It may be done in different ways, like changing them to some faceless nameless entity.  For example, make their input bare bones. Like: \"My OC A meets their presumably dead best friend B on top of the mountain and they have a talk about meaning of life. B is not happy to see A. When A [insert your post], B smirks maliciously and says they never were friends to begin with\". And so on.\n\nTrust me, you need to do it, and you need to do it fast, before your frustrations will make you fall out of love with awesome plots you created. Preserve them. Be it for when that RP group starts over, or for a different RP you find/create, or for some sort of story you may want to write/illustrate.\n\nYou can't control, how other people act about things you enjoy. What you can control is whether or not let their actions to ruin your enjoyment.",
