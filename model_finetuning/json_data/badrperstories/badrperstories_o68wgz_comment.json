            "body": " I get it, I would also love for someone to teach me how to write  better roleplays in English. But then again, most people already expect a certain skill level to be able to enjoy a roleplay, and that is also fine. If you approach someone so that they help you, I am afraid that the answer will be no in most cases, because most random roleplayers are not really equipped to answer/help you with that (or they simply don't want to, because teaching someone and having to write a roleplay with not so good grammar and English just isn't fun for them). I am great at writing and talking  in German, but I am not good at helping to write better in that language, for example. Therefore, my answer would probably also be along the lines of 'Maybe read/watch series in that language' and not much more. \n\nMaybe it would be better to write a search yourself, in which you mention that you want to get better at grammar and English, so that only people who are open for helping you/who don't care about these aspects much reply.",

You could spend time reading the scenes other people do together and hopefully get a few of your own without one person needing to always be put in the position of 'teacher' since you could work through various scenes with several different characters. Most groups also have an OOC chat that you can spend time in to work on your conversational English.\n\nSome groups have a fairly strict standard for English skills and grammar (usually meaning you need to send in an application before joining in with the roleplay at all) but many that I've seen don't really hold to that sort of thing strictly, and if you take your time and work through your application and take care with your responses I bet you can find somewhere that works for you. (But it might take a few tries, it can take a few tries to find a server that is a good fit even without grammar/language skills issues)\n\nGood luck!",

Or: \"do this phrase even make sense? How I would say it better?\". Or \"What sentence feels more natural? A or B?\" \"Or, I should use Past Perfect there, shouldn't I?..\"\n\nThat's actual real life help people ask when RP in different languages. Takes five minutes to sort out and is fun for everyone involved, unless you absolutely against it. Why everyone is assuming OP is asking for something as big as free private tutoring or something?",

            "body": "You shouldn't be roleplaying to learn English. That leads to a lot of frustration from a partner that expects you to have enough grasp of the language to make it sound pleasant and fulfilling when they read your response. Of course, some people will be nice to give tips but learning/teaching a language even through roleplay is HARD.\n\nInstead, what I would recommend to improve is to read books in English. Whenever you encounter words you don't understand, look it up in a dictionary or google. And then keep reading. This should expand your vocabulary, show you what the normal writing pace is like while also showing different writing styles, and also guide you to what good proper grammar sounds like. Hopefully. But in order to really have good grammar you also have to study the basics, like nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.\n\nThe other con to roleplaying to learn English is that you don't know how proficient someone is when it comes to English. Even if they are a native speaker, they can't teach you their language. It's actually harder to learn a language from native speakers of that language (if they are not professional teachers of it), because when you're born speaking a language  you don't notice why things are the way they are until other people point them out to you.\n\nEdit: I am Bilingual and English is my second language. I learned a lot more from reading before I learned from talking with other native English speakers.",

            "body": "My experience with this was a bit...different. A lot of times, people were just like 'Yeah, tell me if something is wrong.' and I would be like 'Sure, why not.' But they did not specify how much help they actually wanted, and got either a.) angry/defensive when I pointed out the most glaring mistakes because it was 'too much' or b.) got disappointed if I just let the little stuff slide (I am not that perfect at grammar myself, and I often think 'If I can read and understand your reply, it's fine') because they thought that they were far better at the language than they actually were. It is super tricky. \n\nOne time, I suddenly had a super unpleasant roleplay, because the person always got sad if I mentioned anything although they knew they were a beginner and rambled about quitting roleplaying forever. A lot of people, unfortunately, just use 'I am a beginner/ not good at the language, just tell me if something is wrong/help me with it' as an empty phrase which makes them immune to criticism, because they have just started and they told me that, so how can I complain about anything? \n\nI know someone who got called a nazi because they give advice on how someone could make their (German) reply more readable, which is a very unusual experience but yeah, some people in the community aren't exactly what you would call nice.\n\nI don't think that it is my job to make sure in every one of my searches that I am not looking to help someone improve their German, because most people read 'looking for someone with decent grammar/spelling' and move on. It is also rather rare that a lot of non-native writers apply to my ads looking for help, so I probably wouldn't include a line about that because it is such rare occurrence that it did not cross my mind before (admittedly, that might be different when you roleplay in English).\n\n I always think it goes both ways: If you have a wish that is a bit extraordinary (like wanting a roleplay to improve your English, but also stuff like not including romance at all in roleplay which is something many people take as a given, or wanting to write a character that is a child for example), you ask a person if they don't have specified anything about that in their ad if this is okay with them, and if they say 'Nah sorry, not my thing' you move on. If people would mention everything that they are open for writing or not open for writing in their ads, these ads would be multiple pages long. \n\n I am totally open to help people, but it really depends on the level of skill they already have. If my replies would basically consist of correcting everything they write or their replies are so hard to read that I can't make much sense of them, that is obviously very different from a guy who sometimes makes minor mistakes but has a decent grasp of how my language works, which is something I don't mind at all.\n\n I am not saying anywhere that OP is less worthy as a roleplayer, that they won't ever find anyone to roleplay with, but with something like that, just approaching people and asking will lead to a lot of dissappointment, so it is better to a.) try again but don't let the people who don't want to get to you (what I do when I approach someone for non-romance roleplays) or b.) create their own search so that people already know what they are getting themselves into. The first also creates a bit of...pressure for your roleplaying partner, because they think 'Oh my, what does this person want for me, a lecture, just me pointing out the most obvious mistakes, or it is just a phrase to explain why their English isn'tperfect?' And to be honest, all of these things could very well be the case, and their past experiences will probably shape how they interpret this sentence.",
