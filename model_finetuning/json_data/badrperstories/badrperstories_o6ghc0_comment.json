If you don't feel comfortable starting with a whole conversation about it, try telling him something like, \"Hey, in your most recent post, there's not a lot for me to respond to. Do you think you could add to it and move things a long a little?\"\n\nAfter a few polite requests, he might get the idea and start doing it on his own.\n\nThat's the non-confrontational approach. If at all possible, I *strongly* suggest having an actual conversation about it instead. You can come to him with something like, \"Hey, here lately I've been spread kind of thin and I don't have as much creative energy to keep the plot moving. I love our RP and our characters, so I don't want it to fizzle out! Do you think you could take the reins and drive our plot some, or maybe help me out with some ideas?\"",

Where do you see the story going?\" And surprisingly they had a lot to say. I asked them why they had kept this all to themselves and they thought I had a clear vision for where the story was going and so was letting me play out that vision. I think I have a bit of a dominant personality when I write and do my best to drive the action forward so I could see why they thought that. \n\nNow I know to do more regularly checks with that person and see what their input might be on the story. \n\nI know it can be frustrating and disheartening but it could also be a big misunderstanding.
