            "body": "I personally don't find playing characters of different ethnicities a problem. But I do think it is fetishization when you only play characters from a specific ehtnic group outside your own. I have a very large arsenal of characters that range from Egyption to Japanese and everything in between. The plot and setting decide what character I use. I've currently got a tomb raider-esque rp set in Egypt and my character is an Egyptian archeologist searching for Cleoptara's tomb  and then they get into all sorts of trouble. I don't see a problem with this. However, if someone were to set up RP set in say...ancient greece ans they used a Kpop idol that is a problem. \n\n\nFor me, the issue is when, like you said, they use the same face claims or the same type of face claims (in this case k-pop) with little to no difference between characters.  \n\nI also feel there is nothing wrong with smut, but if it is purely to write about sex with an idol or someone that looks like said idol, it becomes a bit scetch. \n\nAll that being said, you feelings are totally valid. If it is making you, a person of the group being fetishized, uncomfortable then there is probably a good reason you feel uncomfortable.",

You're feeling them, so they are impactful and valid and you're certainly welcome to question people's motives and feel uncomfortable about trends you're seeing. \n\nI will say though - fetishization occurs all over the internet and seems particularly strong in RP and fan works (fanfic, fanart, etc.). So chances are that yes, *someone* out there is fetishizing Kpop stars. Whether a *specific person* is fetishizing that is another question. But if you feel like they are, then that's a fair interpretation and you're not wrong to question their motives/intentions.",

And when the majority of the writers using Kpop faces are, OOC, very \"look at my adorable smol boy uwu\" or go on and on about the face's sexiness and how much they wanna bone him... Y'know. Hard to believe that your one-dimensional stereotype character is a mistake when you take about his face claim in racist, fetishizing terms.\n\nAt this point, I will not roleplay with someone who uses Kpop faces. There's just too many people being too fucked up about it. Korean actors and models, sure, I use several myself. But at this point Kpop's a hard pass and I don't think I'll ever budge on that.
