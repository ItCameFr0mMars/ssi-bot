I started so many 1x1 roleplays where the other part was just constantly quiet/'mysterious' and reserved, but my partner did not want to think about a reason why our characters need to talk to each other (for example they need each other for a mission, they were childhood friends, whatever). So we basically always had scenes like these:\n\n1. their character stands in a coffeeshop/tavern\n2. my character approaches them, tries to have a conversation \n3. their character just shrugs, is totally unresponsive and it does not seem interested in the conversation at all\n4. I have to think about reasons why my character doesn't just respect this and leaves, keep the whole conversation going or even beg this character to help mine with something\n\nBasically, my character would always have to be a bit...annoying and super extroverted, or the conversation died down and our characters would just stare at each other. \n\nBut if I would reply something along the lines of 'Jimmy respected his wishes.' and my character ends the conversation, they got angry/confused, and blamed me because 'How are we going to continue the story now?'\n\nI think the problem is that many people are inspired by games, were the entire world revolves around the main character, and they picture their character as the main character and get confused when it is boring for the other person to just constantly keep the whole thing going.",
