The tl;dr is that it's inherent to any group environment and there are both snobbish and non-snobbish reasons as to why they form. \n\nI will say that **92 members in one group** is entirely too much to try and consolidate into something with everyone having equal time with and for each other. People are going to naturally segregate based so shared interests, RP styles, time zone/work schedule compatibility, other preferences, etc. *and that is completely fine*. \n\nIf you don't find your niche among a subgroup, then leave. There are millions of RP groups ranging from small to large and you're sure to eventually find a good fit for yourself among another.",

You may know most or all of them, but how many do you directly interact with daily? Eat lunch with? Have a study group with? We naturally fragment into smaller groups because it's more manageable for forming friendships. And in RP, it's more manageable to RP with a smaller group than try to include every single person in one scene or plot arc.",

The server breaks into different \"friend\" groups and often exclude others.\n\nOne advice I give is to try to join in on a conversation that interests you. So if they have a QOTD ask something like \"what would you do if so and so.\" It has to be interesting for you and the server as well. You can similar things in other channels as well depending on their purpose.\n\nGeneral really isn't rhe place place make friends ngl, the pace is to fast and often times joining in on a conversation will get you ignored.\n\nDiscord can be a lot like a school at times which sucks since it is often used as an escape.",
