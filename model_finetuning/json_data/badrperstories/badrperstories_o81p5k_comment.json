            "body": "I haven't been ghosted in years, because I almost exclusively write in group stories. \n\nEven if the person my character is shipped with leaves, there's a whole group and story I have with other people and my character. \n\nUsually when ships happen, both characters have met or had the chance to meet othet characters, so by the time you're pairing off, you both already know you like each other's writing style and you also already know each other's general activity. On top of this, if one of you wants to stay in the story, the mods of that group usually enforce some type of activity requirement. Just like it's usually frowned upon to ONLY write with your ship partner, which forces you both to have a story with your character and others.\n\nYou're less likely to be ghosted in a group game. Just look out for the players with single characters that have been with the story a while because those are the ones that are committed to the group. Then you know they're not going to block you or dodge you. If they end up not feeling it, they'll tell you since most mods frown upon players letting that type of drama into their games. \n\nI've been in the same group for years. I've had some failed character relationships. That's life though. No one meets their soul mate on the first try, so I used that to keep growing my character. And none of these failed relationships are from me being ghosted. \n\nConversely, every time I hear or read about people being ghosted, it's someone who only does 1v1 RP. Makes sense, your entire story depends on just two people so if one dips out, you lose the RP. You can keep writing, but then it's just writing and not RP. I'm not saying ghosting doesn't happen in group games, but it's significantly less noticeable or jarring. \n\nAnd as a bonus, because you get to know these people at your own pace, if you decide to pair off with someone you met in a group game and then start writing your own stories 1v1 away from the group, they're way more likely to stick with it or at minimum give you an explanation if they do not. I met my writing partner through my current group game 3 years ago, and we've since had a number of other spin offs and 1v1 stories. It's been marvelous. No ghosting. Not even the worry of ghostig.",
