It was just hard to find someone because almost nobody (except me and a few others, but I don't write romance) wanted to write the male role, so their stories had to be super great and unique to attract partners.\nAnd in the other forum, the one with the 'No sex' and 'only sex' roleplays, graphic ERPs with strange kinks were almost the norm.

I would never try to lure people in with promises of romance when I am not really planning on writing it, because in the end I know they would only be disappointed.\nYeah, she basically wanted a vampire roleplay (with no sex scenes and romance) but also without a story, so just my vampire character sucking her blood, hurting her and holding her captive. And even if it wasn't for the obvious focus on her character being the victim, that just sounded boring as hell to write.",

Send her to me, I'll write her a story with her lame damsel in distress getting tortured of she's willing to cough up the cash xD\n\nI pretty much exclusively due romance RPs. Though I do love adventure and such also. I'm just a stupid hopeless romantic that reads way too many romance novels. \n\nIt's actually hard to find someone willing to write a slow burn romance, actually. That'll play a guy at least. Most people that play make characters that are willing to do romance also want to eRP like immediately cuz sex = romance for some fucked up reason. \n\nMeh. I'd be interested in learning more about your characters. It's be different to do something not romance-centric. What kinds of RPs do you like doing? And I most certainly do not mind writing multiple characters if that suits your fancy as well.",
