            "body": "it kinda sounds like it'd be a good idea to discuss response times before you start rping with people? just add it into the planning conversation, it helps a lot with ghosting. a lot of people will take at least half an hour to even two days to respond, especially if the rp is a literate/long message one. i also have adhd and yes, it is very hard to remember things and it gets harder if there are more things to remember/do, for example, having a busy day.\n\nalso consider that maybe your response to her trying to tell you why she couldn't respond made her feel like you weren't a good rp partner for her. honestly it sounds like you should start being a little more empathetic to your rp partners and realistic in your goals and standards for rp?",
