            "body": "This doesn't sound like a problem with Discord RP, it sounds more like a problem with a very niche type of roleplay that happens on Discord. That being said, I am enjoying this peek into a segment of the roleplaying world that I've never dipped my toes into.\n\nHonestly you may just want to do what I've ended up doing several times when I grew frustrated with roleplay servers not 'doing it right': Start your own.\n\nI will say though that I disagree with your assessment of peoples pronouns and triggers, though maybe it is just your phrasing that makes it sound like you have a problem with even pretty reasonable triggers. Someone wanting to have conversation about certain topics like abuse, suicide, or body horror of various sorts put under spoilers or kept out of the general chat is fine in my opinion, but triggers that are like 'the name Kevin, frogs, bakudeku, the act of photos being taken, waffles' are less reasonable.\n\nAs for pronouns, respect peoples pronouns, that part of your rant doesn't seem to fit in here, really. Also, while you may not have asked for a safe space, if the person *running* the group has decided that it is one, then you have to respect that. Honestly that just points again to it being a good idea for you to go start the sort of server you'd like to see/write in.\n\nThe last bit of your post doesn't make much sense to me, but perhaps I am just not understanding your meaning. How do other roleplay sites make money? As far as I have ever seen almost all are either hosted on free spaces, take place in wider places that cost them nothing like gaia or WoW where people carve out a roleplay nook, or they are a money sink labor of love for people that pay to host them in a private space (like some forums that don't use a free host, or people who rent a Conan Exiles server to roleplay in).",

            "body": "I have actually started my own rp server, its just if I made a server for every type of server I felt had a problem I'd have like **5 running at once**, and I rather not do that. The point is however is about the sociology of the Discord roleplay environment and how over the years I been observing it, it just is overall not the best. I shouldn't HAVE to think **\"if you want to do something right, you gotta do it yourself\"** because in the grand scheme of things, if the mass majority of people are making **square shaped wheels**, and your the only one making a **actual circle**, there is something wrong.  \n\n\nOn the whole safespace thing, again, that doesn't change the fact its a underlying problem of supply vs demand. **\"you gotta respect that\"** is glossing it over rather then actually addressing it. For example, people have alot of complaints about the Education System, and that is the ***exact*** argument people who support it use.  As one man once said: **\"if we asked people want they wanted, we'd still have horse drawn carriages\"**.  We need actual **action**, rather then **complacency.** Letting things be **doesn't change anything**.  \n\n\nPronouns are fine so long as you **don't focus on them too much**. If you want your pronouns to be used correctly, like in most cases like mental illness or otherwise, you are expected to bring it up **yourself**. Otherwise its **your own fault**. You don't need a **whole server** for that. We come to **roleplay**, not to get **politically correct**. Take that ***elsewhere***.  \n\n\nThe same is for triggers. I'll be blunt on that topic: **we didn't need it before, we don't need it now**. If your uncomfortable with a topic, just tell the person to stop. It is literally that easy, we don't need a ***neon sign billboard*** for it. That's just **social etiquette 101**. If you do anything or talking about a uncomfortable topic, and you keep doing it, your an a-hole. We don't need rules and regulations for this above what we had already.   \n\n\nThe last bit is as your last point says: **they are a money sink labor of love for people that pay to host them in a private space**. I am specifically referring to those specific forums that have to pay to stay up, since it is a monetary investment. You want to make that extra bill on top of your other expenses every month actually worth it, which is good motivation.",

            "body": "I don't disagree with the thought that a lot of rp server discord admins are doing it 'wrong', but sometimes it's less that they are making square wheels while you'd make round ones, and more like you really want peach cobbler and they're making bagels. Sometimes you just don't like bagels, doesn't mean bagels are inherently bad. Some discord admins are definitely out there making shit sandwiches and calling it food, but sometimes it's not that they are making bad food and more that you just don't like the food they are serving.\n\nWe just disagree on the 'safe space' thing. If someone wants to go to the effort of making and maintaining a roleplay group that is a safe space sort of environment, there's nothing wrong with that (even if it might not be a space I would enjoy being in). I think your education system comparison there is a bit of a non sequitur.\n\nAlso, normally people *do* bring up their pronouns. Honestly I've been in a lot of servers with a high population of trans members and usually it's something you only hear about if the person tells you, or if you make a note of it from their intro in the intro channel if the server has one. I am not sure what you mean about a 'whole server for pronouns', that isn't something I have ever seen. Maybe you've just been encountering an entirely different sort of thing on that front than I ever have. \n\nAlso, many people do come to be what you frame as 'politically correct' in a roleplay space (though I wouldn't call having a space where someone's pronouns are respected political correctness, just basic decency), so I don't think your stance on that is as unilateral as you're making it out to be. I personally have zero problems with someone being like 'I prefer he/him pronouns' in their intro. I just make a note to use the right pronouns for them, end of. It's not even a politically correct sort of thing, so I am not sure what you mean by that. \n\nAs for the triggers thing, I think maybe you're talking about some spaces that I do think take it too far, but I think a blanket blurb in the server rules that basically addresses the big ones is fine and good for server health. 'Don't post about pedophilia, sexual assault of any kind or self harm on the server IC or OOC, and put any extreme body horror topics under a tagged spoiler' is a fine limit to have if a server chooses to be the sort that doesn't indulge in those topics. Expecting every single member to feel comfortable with confrontation at all times just seems unreasonable to me (as someone who *is* very comfortable with confrontation.) It seems far simpler to just have a simple blanket list of the worst triggers in place. I do think though that for more niche triggers sometimes people need to just know when to step away from the channel until that topic passes. For example if pregnancy makes someone uncomfortable they can't expect that no one will ever talk about pregnancy. \n\nI *personally* find the trigger lists that become extensive with the rule that you can't mention anything on the list to be silly and impossible to keep up with. I saw one that had **the name 'Matthew'** banned along with probably two dozen other topics like 'mentioning cameras', 'frogs', and 'talking about salad', and to my view and tastes that's getting to be out of hand. I found it unreasonable to expect every member to memorize a list of dozens of mostly mundane topics so that they could keep from mentioning, say, *frogs* at any point.\n\nSo there doesn't need to be some neon billboard, but having a small segment for a short list of common PTSD triggers in the rules is fine and as sad as it is, sometimes necessary. It may seem obvious to many people, but when I was running a server I had to ding people *more than once* for things that should have been dead obvious to not post in the general chats.",

            "body": "Your complaint about respecting people's pronouns is frankly...well, transphobic. Why should people *want* to roleplay with you if you're constantly misgendering them or their characters? The vibe I'm getting here is that you don't seem to have much compassion or care for the person on the other side of the computer screen who is writing with you, which is not the sort of person I'd want to roleplay with. In my admittedly completely anecdotal experience, transgender and nonbinary people are disproportionately represented in the online lit RP community compared to their numbers in the general population, so creating servers that are actively hostile to the trans community isn't a great way to attract active membership. \n\nI get that trigger warnings can be annoying if you don't have triggers, and as a roleplayer who  frequently deals with \"dark\" themes, I personally prefer to play on servers where there's a blanket trigger warning for themes that come up frequently (e.g., a dark vampire-based roleplay is going to contain frequent allusions to blood, violence and death, this is a blanket trigger warning for these topics, as at a certain point it's impractical to tag every instance of these themes, and it's probably impractical for someone who is triggered by these topics to carve out a satisfying roleplay experience on *this* specific server, so it's best for all involved to be clear on this), but people with triggers deserve a space to RP in as well, and if you're finding that the RPs that respect triggers are more active than servers without them, it may simply be that these players prefer an environment with trigger warnings. Even if someone doesn't have triggers themselves, they may agree with the philosophy of including them, and prefer such an environment due to what it says about the administrators values. \n\nYou're making a supply and demand argument, but your argument seems to be \"most people don't *need* trigger warnings, so we shouldn't *have* them\" but that's a misapplication of how supply and demand works. I am *not* a child slave, and yet I *prefer* to avoid buying products made by child slaves because I find child slavery offensive. People don't need to *have* triggers to *prefer* a space that is inclusive to people who do have them. You also seem to not understand what triggers are or how they work if your argument is \"people who have been triggered should just tell me to stop if I trigger them without warning.\" \n\nWhile I think some people do mislabel things they simply *dislike* as triggers, if someone is genuinely having, say, a flashback to &gt;!being raped or witnessing a murder!&lt;, they have just experienced a traumatizing psychological harm that, and you can't just put the cat back in the bag. There's also the fact that Discord RP is available to be read by anyone in the server, so even if you have a private conversation with someone about their triggers or lack thereof, if you don't put a trigger warning on the post you can trigger someone who was reading the thread. This is a pretty common practice in Discord RP and I'd argue it helps make a more cohesive group, so disincentivizing people from reading one another's scenes is harmful to the group overall. \n\nJust because *you* prefer a specific type of server or a specific approach to roleplay doesn't mean the majority of your community will. You seem to have this point of view of \"the things I like are correct, and the things I don't like are wrong, and it has to be the way I want it.\" And...sorry, that's just not how it works. If people want something different, they can make it happen. The evidence from the picture you're painting suggests that you're assuming that you dislike x, thus the majority of players *must* dislike x, but when given the option to choose between X and Y, the communities are consistently choosing X. \n\nI get that it sucks if you're in the minority and there just aren't enough people to sustain what you're looking for. I've been there. I'm sure we all have at some point, that's kinda how hobbies that rely on working with other people and building relationships work. It requires compromise. There's a very human element to this hobby, and if you treat it like a gumball machine where you can twist a handle and get a treat dispensed to you whenever you want, you're probably not going to be very successful in the long run, nor are you going to build satisfying partnerships. \n\nThis is a collaborative hobby. If you want everything just-so, write a novel. Or, get into 1x1. I have had much more success at finding that *one* person who will align with exactly what I'm looking for than an entire group that will. It's just a matter of numbers at this point. I can find a handful of people who want to eat the exact same meal. It's a lot easier to find a large group of people who want to order off the same menu, though.",

We may just have rped in different environments, and I may sound old when I say this, but this was just how things were back in the day. And everybody got along fine.  \n\n\n If you wanted a safespace, there are places for you. I am not saying you can't have em. But when it becomes the vast majority, it becomes a issue.   \n\n\nAlso that last bit is like telling an EVO player to stop playing fighting games if or a MOBA player to stop playing League of Legends or something similar. They don't because that's their passion, and they rage because they care. I like to roleplay in grand settings with lots of people for the same reason as you say: it a collaborative experience. I love cooperating with people and making stories together, I like helping others and making fun adventures with my friends. Why would I ever give up this thing I enjoy?",

            "body": "A normal space is one where people can have their pronouns/identities respected and certain topics aren't brought up because it's common sense to not talk about those sorts of things in, say, a skating rink.\n\nIf you don't have a problem with calling someone by the right pronouns, and you don't have a problem with certain triggering topics (kept to a short and honestly common sense list) being kept out of the public channels, then what *is* the problem?\n\n----\n\nIf what you are saying is that people should 'tolerate intolerance', then I just simply disagree. If you tolerate bigoted talk and hateful shit, even if you try and frame it as 'just awkward stuff from our buddy Steve', then what happens is that you end up with a space that caters to bigots. 'Awkward stuff Steve said' should be things like Steve overshared about how he picks his nose and eats it, not things like 'Ah, Steve said a slur again/purposefully misgendered someone. You know how he is~'\n\nIf one \"side\" is saying 'I just want to be myself, my dude' and the other is saying 'I want the freedom to call you and your identity invalid', then you need to not give the two stances equal footing. They are not equal, they do not deserve to be framed as equal things worthy of the same time and 'tolerance'. One 'group' is just trying to exist, and the other is claiming that you need to provide them the space to attack the validity of the first group. \n\nIt is honestly really disingenuous to say that people need to learn to 'be considerate of others around them' when what you are talking about is the bigoted talk of the second group and them being allowed to cause wanton harm.\n\n'Non-LGBT' people and people without trauma, and all of those various sorts of people that you named (the cool kid, weird kid etc) are absolutely welcome to exist in roleplay spaces within the rules that community sets.\n\nYou may find The [Paradox of Intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) to be an interesting read.\n\n&gt;The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.\n\nThis is obviously a broader scope than just in the context of roleplay group dynamics, but boiled down to simple terms I think it is very relevant. If you create a space where intolerance is allowed to thrive, then it *will* push out the other side that is the target of the intolerance. I am so glad that a large part of the roleplay community has decided 'Fuck that. Don't be a shitheel and you're welcome here.'\n\nIt sounds like you need to learn to read the room around you and understand the kinds of people that you are hanging around. The room is saying that certain harmful and bigoted behaviors are no longer widely accepted in a large segment of the roleplay community. You keep speaking as though your views are the majority, when they obviously aren't in the spaces that you are finding yourself in. Read the room.",

            "body": "First of all, I've been roleplaying online in various settings for literally 20 years now. I've been navigating triggers for close to a decade, \"squicks\" for longer than that. New to *you* is not the same as *new*. \n\nNot respecting people's pronouns is a transphobic action. Unambiguously. Arguing that having to respect trans people's pronouns and give them space to be comfortable playing a game in a public space is *too hard* is behaving in a transphobic manner. If you would like to not be perceived transphobic, the best way to do that is to stop being transphobic. There's a pretty simple solution, and it's not opining about the good old days when you were allowed to be casually ignorant of how your actions made trans people feel subhuman. What has changed is not that misgendering people is a problem, but that you are no longer allowed to be blissfully unaware of how your actions impact people. If you don't want to be a transphobe, you have the option to stop being a transphobe. It's that simple. You claim to have compassion. Show some by allowing yourself to be humbled and minorly inconvenienced.\n\nIt is *your opinion* that the vast majority of RP spaces should not be safe spaces. Your entire argument is \"people should cater to my preferences.\" You have provided no demonstrable evidence as to why the inclusion of trigger warnings degrades the RP experience as a whole, nor have you provided evidence that the vast majority of roleplayers would prefer a server that doesn't include trigger warnings, nor have you provided any evidence that the vast majority of servers are strict about triggers. *Why* does it become \"an issue\" when the vast majority of servers cater to people who want triggering content tagged? Because you find it annoying? Why should everything revolve around you? Your argument seems to be \"I feel like these servers are centering the needs of trans people and people with triggers instead of me. I have self-declared my needs and desires as normal, and the needs and desires of people unlike me as aberrant, and therefore, because of my appeal to normality (which is a logical fallacy, for what it's worth), *my* desires should be centered.\" \n\nAnd, to be clear, I do not need a server that is vigilant about trigger warnings to safely roleplay. I prefer to roleplay with people who have few or no limits when I am seeking 1x1 partners. In fact, I would estimate that I roleplay potentially-triggering topics at a greater rate than the average roleplayer. And yet, I still consider it a net good that roleplayers with triggers have options and don't all get shunted into the one server that addresses their needs. At the end of the day, it is far easier for me to use trigger warnings on my posts than it is for someone with triggers to navigate a space where trigger warnings don't exist. With trigger warnings, *everyone* can participate. Without them, the roleplay is inherently exclusionary. In general, I think more people being included is good, actually, and if I want a space where I don't have to worry about trigger warnings, I can still find them. \n\nWhat I'm telling you is: you don't have to give up Group RP, but you have to accept that Group RP doesn't exist to cater to your specific desires. The only way it's going to be exactly how you want it to be is if you make your own server.",

And I won't say it may not be potentially influenced, because saying it does not is just a lie from the stand point of \"every human is selfish in their pursuits in some form or fashion\".

It's a culmination of various experiences and crystalized into a single view point.   \n\n\nIf I wanted to be truly selfish. I am fully capable of being fully selfish.

            "body": "I can only speak to one of these issues, since I've never played in DBZ spaces and every server I've made or joined has been 18+ with ID checks to verify.\n\nAs for the \"Servers, Lack of Commitment and lack of Competition\" idk I'm inclined to think you've come across a bad batch. Yeah, there's definitely Admins and Mods out there with a \"if you don't like it, fuck off,\" and to a degree I can figure out who is in a world I've made because they're there for a story vs who is just there to ponce about. But it's been 3 years of me *actively* improving my main server. If a concern comes up three times from three different people, then I work with my team to fix it. We're not going to change the whole game because **one** person thinks something is a problem, but we do listen to our players and try our best to make it all better.\n\nWe've had competing servers that are in the same genre as us, most of them have gone under. We have not, largely because of our commitment to growth and improvement. The writing we started with when we launched in 2018 was any where from 1-2 lines per post, to what we have now which is predominantly novella if not multi-para in spite of our writing requirement only being 1 paragraph per post.\n\nI know for a fact that my server is not some fluke in how we've lasted. The Broken's lasted for 9 years. My 3.5 year old server is a baby compared to them. Then there's the Crystal Observatory, 2 years old. Avenger's Engame, 2 years old. Legend of the Fair Isle, 4 years old. Gangland Gotham, 4 years old. Heroes United, 4 years old. Flyover, 2 years old.\n\nAll of these servers named don't do any of the things you've named. Yeah, if you're looking in some of the more toxic hubs (which is pretty much all of them) or on Disboard for your RP, you're going to get people who see it as \"my house, my rules, you can go.\" But the 8 I've just mentioned, including mine, are all 18+, nothing at all to do with Dragonballz, and regularly show a commitment toward growth, they all listen to their writers to improve, and they all support their writers - because we know that without our writers, we don't have a story.\n\nAs for activity, I work from home. I'm online in some capacity nearly every waking hour. Any player that wants to write, has someone to write with, and the same is true for the other 7 listed.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I am genuinely sorry you have had such a poor experience with group games on Discord. I can only say that it's not all of them. It might be most of them, sure, it's really easy to throw a server together and then advertise it. But there's Admins out there who actively put in the time to make their stories a great place to write in. It's like dating though, you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find the one that's a prince/princess.",

I think you want to do the 'right' thing and basically treat the people you interact with well. I think you don't fully understand the issues at play though and it's coloring the way you view some of the nuance here.\n\nFor example, what do you even mean about someone 'being a karen' about being trans? If they're being an asshole then what you have is a problem with someone being an asshole, not a problem with pronouns. Can you give an example or two of the behavior you mean?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that you're African American, so maybe this example will hit home a bit better. How would it feel if a non-black person came into a space populated by mostly black people and they told you that they were going to dictate how people could talk in that space and say that they were going to use the soft r when talking about black people, and that you had to just accept that there's all types in a space?\n\nThat sucks, right? Someone with no lived experience of the nuance there, no real sense of the weight of what they are saying they want to do thinks they get into come into a space made by and populated with a good amount of African American people and tell you that you need to deal with them acting however they want. The person may not mean to be hateful, but they are ignorant and they are being harmful anyways. That person sounds so tonedeaf and deluded to think that they get to come into a space that has a certain culture and then tell *you* how you can talk and tell *you* that you need to be cool with them calling you 'friendly-intentioned' slurs.\n\nThat's basically what you're arguing for, but substitute out African American people here for trans people.\n\nI understand what you are trying to say, I just think you are mistaken. I think you don't really hear what I have been saying though and you're skimming over a lot of the points I make and avoiding addressing them. For example, if the way that you want things to be isn't the norm, then shouldn't *you* be 'reading the room', as you say? You're the outlier here now, and the one in a space that has a culture that has developed in a certain way. The 'room' at large isn't vibing with what you want, so by your viewpoint ***you*** should be reading the room around you and adjusting to it.",

I'm sure you've heard \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" It is our actions, and not our intentions, that are to be judged, because it is only our actions, and not our intentions, that create tangible results in the universe. \n\nI am not saying that you have *intended* to hurt trans people, but that, regardless of your intentions, you *are* hurting trans people when you don't respect their pronouns or when you misgender them. Goodness and compassion are not innate qualities someone either does or does not possess. They are practices that someone can choose to partake in or not, which is the best possible scenario. It means we have the power to choose goodness and compassion at any point, regardless of our prior actions. You can *choose* to stop behaving in a transphobic way at any time. If compassion and respect for trans people is what is in your heart, then I would recommend ensuring your future behaviors align with the values in your heart. \n\n\\--\n\nI'm not sure why you think that making the argument that you're not doing this to be selfish, (but for, what, the benefit of other people?) is better, honestly. It comes off as a patronizing \"I know what's best for you\" stance. My argument isn't that you're selfish so much as that you seem to have an overinflated sense of your own position in the universe. You appear to believe that what you think is the best way to RP *must be* the best way to RP for everyone. You claim that your position comes from observations about the world, but you have yet to provide any evidence that your contentions derive from anything other than your own opinions and preferences. \n\nYou have made bold assertions about how your way is the way that things should be done, but when called upon to substantiate them, you default to cryptic generalities. Where is the *evidence?*\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, unless you can provide evidence to your claims, even if you respond, I will be treating this discussion as closed.",

Afraid to say, that's on you, particularly if it's something that happens frequently and you haven't modified your behavior. Something stops being an honest mistake when it is repeated without modification.\n\nYour mention of \"science\" indicates to me this is about more than pronouns, though, given pronouns are concerns of linguistics, not \"science.\"",

I can see that not all trans people are like that, but if that is the case, perhaps I am just seeing a very vocal minority.   \n\n\nIt is this kind of stuff that turns me off from pronouns to begin with, because its associated with bad people. It's like how the furry community is likely a very good bunch, it just got a lot of bad apples and people tend to look at the bad apples as an example of the whole, thus, \"making them look bad.\" This may be one of those situations. There are people making trans people look bad, and that is how my perception of the whole thing is shaped. I didn't start out feeling this way, it was colored by the actions of others.   \n\n\nAlso I think I understand what you are saying, it is just as I said, I don't agree with it,  in the sense of \"your the outlier now\" because I know a bunch of people back from before the Google+ Mass Migration hit that think similarly to I do. I know I am not alone: I know that because I seen it with my own two eyes. And because of that there is no convincing me until it is clear cut all those people either converged or moved on to greener pastures, leaving nothing but the \"modern age\" of people who think this way. If that is the case, I am the last one and honestly I am too stubborn to give up this way of life I find comfortable.   \n\n\nIf the cold reality is \"I am the outlier\", then I am going down fighting.
