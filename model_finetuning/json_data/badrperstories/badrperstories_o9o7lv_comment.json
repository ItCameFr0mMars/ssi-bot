I understand there will be days/periods where you're not going to be up for RP. Whether its mental health problems or other life events that pop up. If a partner can let me know they will be gone for x amount of time, that's great! If they disappear for a while and then come back and explain why they disappeared, equally great!\n\nIf they disappear with no explanation and then post an ad looking for more partners? Huge red flag for me. These ads where someone has a \"blanket\" apology are the biggest red flags. If you had to step away from an RP because of a mental health problem and now you're back and well enough to RP again, why not apologize to your partner? Sure maybe some partners might have gotten fed up and blocked you or something, but what about the rest? \n\nTalk to your partners. It's not that hard.",

But if you're in a better place and then simply abandon your old partners without any explanation, I think that's a bit of a red flag. I replied to another commenter about this, but if you do not feel well enough to even explain you'll be gone, that's understandable. But what about when you're in a better state and you're not going through an episode? When you're feeling better, isn't it the decent thing to do to let your partners know? Maybe give them some assurance that you didn't just ghost them because there was something wrong with their writing. \n\nI know people will block/unfriend once they ghosted, but not everyone will. I think there should be a reasonable effort to apologize to those people or at least explain. Your mental health matters. So does theirs.",

            "body": "Hey, so, mental health issues are very common among rpers.  It turns out that a lot of us are good at writing escapist fiction because we are motivated toward escapism.  And speaking as someone who has been on meds for about 20 years now, and whose father and grandmother also had the same problems, I have no sympathy for people who use this as an excuse for bad behavior.  On a day when it's a heroic struggle to get out of bed, a person can still take 30 seconds on their phone to say, \"Bad mental health week, maybe no rp for a while, sorry.\" Most of us are less tolerant of mental health as a ghosting excuse,  because we know what is meant by it in most cases is, \"I felt bad and didn't feel like dealing with someone else's possible emotional reaction, so I decided to make them suffer for how I feel instead.\"\n\nIs it possible they made a suicide attempt and were Baker Acted and literally weren't allowed internet for a while?  Sure.  But it's not the most likely answer.  That situation is rare, and flaking out and then showing up to look for new partners is common.",

But there was probably a lack of \"oomph\" or pizzazz or whatever that ephemeral quality is whenever RP hits just right, so maybe that's the real reason he never got them back. He wouldn't be the first of the last to do that. ;) I've been guilty of it myself. Sometimes things just fizzle out, and it's no one's fault, really. The oomph is either there or it isn't. You never sought me out after our RP fizzled, and while it stung a bit at the time, I get it now. Sometimes it comes down to something you can't quite quantify.",

If someone ghosts and doesn\u2019t say anything for days\u2026 or months it can leave the other person feeling anxious, like they did something to upset the other person, etc. and all of these thoughts can hurt someone else\u2019s mental health. I can understand how people will see it as a red flag if someone is ghosted, and they only find out their partner is back through an ad. For me it also ties onto a respect thing where if someone ghosts me, I would appreciate it if they at least came directly to me to tell me\u2026 they don\u2019t necessarily have to apologize, but finding out through an ad is kinda\u2026 eh? Ya know. \n\nFor me, I would appreciate it if my partner just said they were having issues with rp and needed a break. They don\u2019t have to elaborate, but it helps me mentally when people don\u2019t randomly ghost or disappear.",
