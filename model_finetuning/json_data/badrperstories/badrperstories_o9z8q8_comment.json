That is a little...uncomfortable. I would not know what to reply without sounding like 'I wouldn't be interested in you anyway, don't worry.' and offend you.\n\nMaybe he just didn't know what to say to that.\n\nIt also would make me question if you are able to seperate real life and roleplay, or if you are one of those types who suddenly thinks that someone is not a good person because that person writes villains, or someone who believes that men shouldn't write female characters, and so on. In my personal experience, many people who I roleplayed with and who always point out that they are married/have a boyfriend had a tendency to mix real life views and roleplaying, which was often a little annoying. Not saying you are like that, but some of them always assumed that harmless questions like 'Do you think that Greg would like Sara?' about our characters was some hidden message that I want a secret romance (and I don't even write romance).",

If someone does not want to write something, no matter the reasoning behind it, I should respect that. The way OP worded it sounded (in my opinion) a bit weird. It is not that being married in itself is a red flag, of course it is not. It would also not be weird to casually mention it along the way, while writing ooc. Sharing it like this, however, sounds like their real life relationship is directly linked to their roleplaying relationship with this person, and that sounds a bit weird even if it wasn't meant that way. Especially if the other person has already said that they don't plan on writing sexual scenes at all, it feels a little...off? Like I said, a bit as if OP wouldn't trust me to respect their boundary without a good reason like being married. \n\nAlso, it reminded me personally of people who conflated 'I don't write smut because I am married and therefore, it makes me uncomfortable to write sexual scenes in roleplays' with their husbands issues with jealousy, and suddenly I had to worry about destroying their real life relationship when our characters got to close in a romantic way, because I was not sure if it might could make their husband/boyfriend jealous even though it was all totally fictional for me. Like, I don't want to be the reason their marriage is in shambles afterwards or their emotional affair lol",
