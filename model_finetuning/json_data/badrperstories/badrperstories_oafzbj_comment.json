All because she was told, \"Stop harassing the PTSD patient.\" Mind you, the reason my oc was traumatized was because her oc convinced the entire group to leave her behind all because my oc didn't let the guy her oc had a crush on in the group because her oc wanted him solely because he was attractive....AFTER 2 HOURS OF KNOWING HIM.",
