            "body": "People who want smut in their roleplay definitely need to put that they only want to find partners that are 18+, but if I was posting a roleplay advert I wouldn't put 'ERP' in the tags or whatnot even though I do prefer to have elements of that in romance roleplay. The reason for that is that I don't want it to be a *focus* of the roleplay, and I don't want to draw in people looking for ERP specifically. If ERP comes up in a roleplay (and it doesn't always) then I want it to happen because it organically makes sense for the characters and the scene, *not* because I am 'seeking out' ERP, if that makes sense?\n\nBaseline though if someone wants to have even the possibility for those sorts of elements in their roleplay then they *need* to put 18+ in their advertisement.\n\nAs for advice on how you can avoid those people, you might consider only answering ads by people who specifically say they don't do any sort of smut RP, and possibly consider seeking out other minors to write with so you're all on the same page.",

            "body": "When I started roleplaying at age 12, tbh, almost all of what I wrote was ERP, though back then it was called smut. I pretty much did that until I was 16, always with others my age (or at least who claimed to be). To that end, I can understand people wanting to ERP with minors if they themselves are minors. What's funny about that is I lived in a very repressed household, so when I look back, most of what I wrote was guess work that made 0 sense.   \n\n\nAmusingly, I've seen other posts on this very subreddit where people specifically say that while they like and are open to ERP, they specifically leave it out of their ads because while their RP will include it, they don't want that to be the main part or the selling point. I can definitely see the logic in that, but you're right that it's a bit misleading for the people who don't want any ERP at all to get their hopes up only to find that the person with the ad does expect for their writing partner to 'put out' in play.   \n\n\nI don't know if there is a way to fully avoid that, but you can cover your ass a bit when replying to ads or rp requests by making it clear you do not and will not write erotic scenes. Then later if they try to take the play there, you have a log you can pin in your chats or screen shot to them to remind them that this is a hard limit.   \n\n\nYou can also, as you see the scene heating up, drop one of those \"\\`\\`\\`Fade to Black\\`\\`\\`\" things to signify that you're acknowledging the characters have had sex, but you're not going to write it out. Then do your next post starting the next scene. One of three things will happen.   \n1) They'll get pissy about it, at which point you remind them that you communicated this at the start. If they stay mad, you've dodged a bullet and you can just tell them \"this isn't working out.\" No ghosting involved, just a parting of ways.   \n2) They'll remember on their own or otherwise take the hint, adapt, and continue with the new scene and story.  \n3) They'll switch to DMs to ask you about it, and you can reiterate the boundary with more clear and open communication.   \n\n\nThere will always be people who think rules and boundaries don't apply to them. Like if they play well enough, it'll make you want to write smut with them. Or the people who think their wants matter more, so when the time comes, they'll just badger you into it. All you can do is be crystal clear at the start and then stick to your boundaries. Whether they want to keep the story going with you or not is up to them and you can't force it.",

            "body": "I have no idea what platform you're RPing on (sounds like Discord?), but I get your frustration. People should always be mindful of the age of their writing partners when things start getting nsfw. As I'm not sure how you're finding these people:\n\n* If you're in a group together, I'd recommend to the admin placing an introduction channel for the members. They could state their ages/age range (or just say, \"I am a minor,\" and maybe even any hard limits (\"no ERP\").\n* If you're just answering ads, I would strongly suggest opening with this information. \"Hey! I saw your ad and thought it looked like a lot of fun. I am a minor and do not do ERP, so if that's a dealbreaker, just let me know.\"\n* If you're the one putting out ads, make it very clear. \"I am a minor and do not ERP.\"\n\nI include the bit about being a minor in every single instance because, as a person over 30, I don't want to write *anything* with minors. It just makes me uncomfortable, even if it's SFW! But I also remember roleplaying as a minor, and back then, I'd lie about my age and try to RP with anyone. So, I appreciate that you're not doing that, but I usually make it \"my responsibility\" to verify partners are as old as they say they are.\n\nI'm willing to bet the majority of the people doing this are minors themselves. Most 18+ RPers want to check ages before they get into NSFW to protect both parties, whereas minors will generally not bring it up. There are definitely (millions of) creeps out there, but I'm willing to bet these are teenagers.\n\nTL;DR: Be upfront from the get-go, and don't feel weird about stating your boundaries right off the bat. You'll save everyone time and frustration.",
