If you guys did not agree on anything concrete, it might be that you have different ideas of \"quickly.\" For me, \"quickly\" is a daily post. For someone else, quickly might be within a few hours. Someone else might think a reply a week is quick. \n\nDecide if posts at this speed are a deal breaker for you. If it is, politely let this person know. \"Hey, when we started, I was expecting posts (at frequency you anticipated). At the speed we're posting now, I'm having a hard time staying interested and invested. Thank you so much for writing with me, but I'm looking for something more rapid-fire and am going to have to drop this RP to pursue that.\"\n\nIf it's not a deal breaker, I'd just let it slide and keep RPing without prodding her again about it; especially if you guys didn't set any actual expectations besides \"rather quickly.\" Not sure if when she said she was free every day if she specified she was free to RP for a certain number of hours, or if she meant she was free to type a post each day. People have all kinds of different measurements for availability, so it's best to be upfront and clear about your expectations from the start.",
