            "body": "The problem with 'just' an ID is even with sections blacked out you're asking a lot from somebody you're presumably just in the 'feeling it out' stages of.  I don't want to show my face early to some rando, some idiot kid might try pawning you off on an image they googled or their parents' ID etc.  I'd be wary of having a scammer nick my personal details or something, doxxing is a thing.  Identity theft is a thing.  I'd be worried even with censoring that \"woah that's my ID\", rationally or not - it'd already give away stuff like geographic location from the getgo.\n\nIt sucks but there's little to no surefire way without privacy violation or knowing the person indepth.  You can try and lay out how damn serious it is to you in the first conversation but some kids are very frustratingly \"im mature and What They Dont Know Wont Hurt Them\" to everyone else's detriment.  It's incredibly selfish on their part but I don't know how you can get it through to them in a way that will stick.\n\nSome tips/red flags I have noticed:\n\n* One guild I saw used 'what was your favourite song at 14?', supposedly caught most of them but a lot of people there were... bizarre lowercase calling-people-mistress-ooc types so not 100% surefire.\n* A person in your friend group who hangs out in the voice or videochats but is never heard, 'too shy', 'mute', 'webcam/mic broke' call it what you like it's suspect when things go on for years and everybody else can manage, see: /r/catfish if it's that kind of friend group.  Mute disability is valid but unfortunately yeah some folk use the pretense of it to fly under the radar.\n* If it feels off your gut feeling is telling you something, go with that even if it feels 'unfair'.\n* They wouldn't be reliably able to fake life stuff/a persona for long, most 'im totes 18 lemme iiin' will have a schedule that lines up with being offline for school, no job experience etc.\n* See what their opinion is on underage people sneaking into 18+ spaces - if they're too blaise about it you don't wanna be playing with them anyway, if they agree with you in a way that feels like 'smile and nod' or trying too hard to suck up to/mirror you go into the actual reasons why it's bad and how it would make you feel if it happened to you.",

I think it's kind of a stretch to ask for an ID, which is a legal document. You don't just randomly send such a thing to a stranger you just met on the Internet.\n\nNot saying that you would do that, but there are softwares that can remove blacked out parts, and I can see why people wouldn't want to risk it.\n\nThese being said, what you could do is ask them leading questions. You say you want your partners to be over 18 (which is a perfectly reasonable request!), so by this age, they should be students. Ask them apparently random questions about student life or questions pertaining to that stage in their life.\n\nAnother thing you can do, is try to reminisce about the past and led them into a conversation about technologies or cartoons or TV series or whatever that existed then and probe to see how familiar they are with them.\n\nFor example, I'm 28 and I like to reminisce about early 2000s cartoons, and things like those 1000 in 1 games (if you know what I mean) and ancient phones and how annoying the dial-up connection was.\n\nTry to talk to them about stuff like that or ask them questions and see how they react to you probing about.\n\nI hope I was of any help explaining the ID problem and what you can do to have your proof!\n\nI really do understand you and why you want to make sure your partners are over 18, but there are other ways to do that, other than straight up asking for their ID.\n\nHope I helped!",

People will always find their ways. It\u2019s kind of hard to find a solution in terms of that for yourself because putting a simple trust in your partner can always go wrong, everything can go wrong. should that take the fun of a rp away for you? no no. I guess what I always do is check out their profiles because some people are not even smart enough to lie appropriate. They will tell me they\u2019re 21 but in other recent posts they claim to be 17 or whatever.",
