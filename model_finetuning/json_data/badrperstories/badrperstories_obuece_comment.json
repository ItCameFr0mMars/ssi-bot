It's always really flattering at first, but I've come to realize that, whether they know it or not, this is something called \"love-bombing\", which is meant to hook you in by excessive flattery. Eventually, these people can get...kind of weird? Very clingy, manipulative, jealous, etc. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. \n\nIt's happened enough now that I get very wary of people who do this right off the bat.",
