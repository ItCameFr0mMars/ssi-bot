It\u2019s normal to change preferences over time. Maybe you need fewer but \u201chigher quality\u201d roleplays these days. (When I say higher quality, I mean they tick your boxes for a good RP.)\n\nBurn out is something I know very well, and I often cause it by running in to something balls blazing. 13 roleplays would achieve that in no time at all. \n\nI think you should see what happens when you take on less. Maybe cut down to about 4 with your very favorite partners if you can and see what happens.",
