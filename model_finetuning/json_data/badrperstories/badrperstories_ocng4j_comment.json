If someone had a conflict with him (for example because he disrespected the rules), he would argue rather normal in the beginning. Then, he would send detailed descriptions how to kill yourself or descriptions of disgusting violence to the other person, also extremely detailed with slicing wrists open and so on.\n\nHe did not care if anyone got triggered, he was also not a troll. In his mind, when someone 'wronged' him, he punished them that way. Because he knew that it is a sensitive topic for many, and it scared people. If you didn't do anything to set him off, he acted like a normal human being. I think that maybe, this person wasn't a troll as well. But you not wanting to write with him made him think you 'wronged' him in a way and wasted his time, so he wanted to get back at you, which is disgusting entitled behavior on his part.",
