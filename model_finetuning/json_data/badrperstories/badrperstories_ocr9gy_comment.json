Sent a friend request, no answer. After about a month, I went on with my life.\n\nAbout a month ago, I responded to an ad.\nWe started chatting and exchanging ideas. Some things he said sounded familiar but I kept quiet about my suspicions.\n\nThe prompt was basically the same. I knew it was him but he didn\u2019t know it was me ( different\nReddit account name). We began the role play again and things were great. When he said I sounded like a old partner he lost touch with, I fessed up. Nothing changed. We caught up OOC and continued the role play.\n\nWe didn\u2019t make it as far in the second story as we did the first when the same thing happened. Server gone and no response when I reached out. I\u2019m done with him but I\u2019d left a bad taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t want to stop rp but much more of this and that\u2019s what I will do.
