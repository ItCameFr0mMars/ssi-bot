Roleplay is a *hobby*. Hobbies aren't supposed to be a source of stress and drama and pain. \n\nYour mention of being ready to start a fight makes me wonder if you're addressing issues in an aggressive way when they come up. That definitely can turn a situation for the worse. Your tone sets, well, the tone of a conversation. \n\nThat being said, everyone deserves to have their boundaries respected and their consent obtained. If that's consistently not happening, then it's time to leave the platform and look for another one.",

If they do something to upset me and I'm the only one hurt by it, I just cut 'em out and walk away. It's not worth acknowledging; it's not worth the time wasted. Just move on.\n\nIf I do care about the person and want to continue to have any kind of relationship with them, I ask myself if this is a one off thing. Is it likely to ever happen again in the future? Is it really a big deal? Am I hungry? Am I tired? Is this still going to feel like a big deal tomorrow, or will I feel better if I step away for 10 minutes?\n\nOnly if I want to continue to know the person, and only if it's something I truly think was a wrong on their part and that I can't get past, or don't want to happen again, will I bring it up. It doesn't need to be a fight from the get go! Just a, \"Hey, can we talk about the other day?\" or, \"Hey, when you do x, it makes me feel y.\"\n\nBe calm and neutral and confident. Listen to what they have to say, but don't let them make excuses, tell you the way you feel isn't valid/warranted, or tell you to grow a thicker skin. Be open, however, to the idea it was a misunderstanding. Give them a chance to understand and to apologize.\n\nHow they respond is everything. If they're shitty about it, you can reconsider if they're one of those people you want to keep in your life.\n\nIf you constantly feel disrespected or wronged by other people, by the way, make sure to step back and try to see it from their perspective. Sometimes people are rude and shitty, but sometimes we're on edge or too defensive or hostile. Sometimes we're looking for trouble where there does not have to be any.",

Might be me not understanding the game, though.\n\nWas it the player speaking to you OOC about breaking rules, or was it their character suggesting it to yours? Because that makes a massive difference. If it's out of character and you don't want to do it, a, \"No, thanks. That's not how I want to write this character,\" should be plenty. If they don't accept that, it's on them.\n\nIf it was in character conflict but you pulled everyone OOC to discuss, I guess I can see how that would irritate them? Sounds like the other player could have handled it more maturely.\n\nThe TL;DR of what I'm saying is to never conflate IC and OOC, but I am not sure that's what's happening here. If you say, \"no thank you, I don't want to do that,\" while OOC, and people react poorly, they're the ones being assholes.",
