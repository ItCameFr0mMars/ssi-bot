But, because I know there are people that need to be mindful of what they see/read, I am going to tuck things neatly behind a spoiler tag. Best compromise I can come up with.\n\n&gt;!If one is going to play a nonconsensual scene, it does not matter if one is in the BDSM community, or any other community for that matter. One has to really, really communicate with a partner about this, whether one is the doer or the do-ee. There are people that say rape has no place in writing or roleplatyng; I disagree. Whether or not one finds such a thing distasteful, the fact remains that a hell of a lot of people have that as part of their kinks, and those people are going to seek like-minded partners.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And that is okay.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The beauty of this hobby is that you control the experience. You don't have to play/interact with anyone you don't want to. If someone is freaking you out by being all weird, you can block them. You can even just turn off the computer and go play with the cat. Cats don't judge you on how well/what you are willing to write. (I may or may not go and play with the cat when something online pisses me off.)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Likewise, you can be vocal about it and just tell the person that you don't want to explore that scenario. If they try being a 'Fetlife Dom', read them the riot act. You do not, do not have to interact with this material if that is not your preference. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Your friend seems to be caught up in something less than healthy. This guy's popping up a lot of red flags and sounds like a sixteen year old fuckboy to me. If a friend of mine were caught up in someone behaving this way, I would probably say 'Rapedude is a fuckboy, you deserve better and you need to run, not walk away. Ain't no e-peen worth the potential trouble this nitwit might create.'!&lt;",
