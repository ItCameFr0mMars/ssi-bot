It was never a problem with the quality of  his writing, he was and is a great writer, it was all ooc stuff that got worse over time.  Some of that was religion-related, too, though; I am and he's not, and it did affect the way we wanted to write fantasy cosmologies.  Some of it was that he was never able to believe anything positive I told him about his writing or himself, and that just gets exhausting.  \n\nEventually I felt he was playing head games with me ooc, including asking for a break so he could go back to school, them later admitting he had lied about that and asking to rp again, then further down the line denying that ever happened and gaslighting me about it.  I hung on longer than I should have because he was so talented at writing and so good at developing setting and characters with me, but in the end I realized writing was stressful and not fun any more.  \n\nI felt hollow inside after that, too.  But I did find other good partners over time who stuck around, some for years, and I always felt it was the right decision.  You will find partners that are better for you, too.  It may take time, and you may and probably will need to take breaks from rp, but it gets better.",

Roleplaying is a hobby, and a hobby should not take an emotional toll on you. It is supposed to make you feel happy.\n\nMy experience with partners being awful or worse, ghosting me, is that it feels like breaking up. You probably made a friend, and it's over now.

            "body": "I've seen and heard of fetishization and fixation issues in people before, both in and out of RP; it seems to follow a trend less related to the age of the person and more about their mentality regarding their own depth as a human being. I don't know this person, but seeing how they latched on to something so random and began to over use it in whatever setting they were given while only doing surface research definitely feels like obsessive weeb behavior, like kids who like anime using that anime as the bible for which to be Japanese by, even if it's totally wrong, but they also make it part of who they are in a way despite this. It's their \"thing\", they're the \"Jewish\" friend, while someone else is the \"Naruto\" friend, or the \"car\" friend, who can't exist or define themselves outside of their \"things\".\n\nI say this because I also notice people that have issues creating depth and interesting characters tend to have that issue with themselves. Perpetually stuck in the middle school mindset of \"who am I if not my things?\" When personalities were developing or breaking apart, people were bullied or included based on likes/dislikes and dishonesty became a ruse in order to not be exiled because people cared more about the \"thing\" than the \"person\" (i.e. \"Nick is a dickhead but he's the gamer friend and has all the new consoles so we out up with his weird jokes so we can try the new Halo game.\" Or in reverse, \"These are the only girls that like the same niche thing I do, I don't like how they're mean gossips that make fun of the freshman kids but if I lose them I'll be by myself...\")\n\nThat's anecdotal personal experience, mind you, but having seen it in my own friends and heard from my bestie about her ex-friends, it's likely they're still in that space mentally because they never chose to self reflect and become a person because it's scary and hard and sometimes people aren't liked so it's better to be a shell with only enough depth to get your feet wet but who has many Things to fill it up instead and appear deeper than it is. Take the things out, though, and the water is suddenly much much lower that it first looked.\n\nA lot of it tends to happen when something \"clicks\" in some way or they derive a sense of false individuality and superiority from it because it makes them \"different\", or they project their own inner journey outward because inner revelation is so rare they latch onto it. Someone only playing a certain anime over and over, or suddenly all of their characters share a plot point/powerset/sexuality/fetish/etc because they like it or just discovered it, they only write one niche genre it topic because it interests them and they try to work it in where it doesn't belong, etc.\n\nThis can roll over to other bad rp habits but in this case, I just feel too strongly that they're projecting their fixation on Things into characters because they're dealing with their own problem of \"who am I without these things?\" and either doesn't realize it or is too afraid to find out, hence the very very stark and systematic bio sheets that are easy to make, familiar and general have easily followed plot progressions.\n\nIf that ends up being the case, I'm sorry you had to struggle with a puddle that wanted to be an ocean so badly they filled themselves with junk just to make it that way. There's nothing you can do for those people, so cutting off was the best option you could make, and I know it's rough leaving anyone you've known that long behind, but I'm hoping soon the fresh cut will heal over and you'll be happier for it.",

Back in about 1996-7 (stop laughing at my age, you young whippersnappers! \u2665), I met a player in one of the old AOL RP rooms, something based on Star Trek. We were adversarial at first, but then they happened to bring in a male character I liked and we became partners. We played from then to the early 00's very frequently. Over the thirteen years we were friends, They slid more and more into 'slash' play. Characters they once would have fought to play off of were suddenly called 'Mary Sues', and they grew increasingly disrespectful. The endgame was them just completely betraying me. We haven't spoken since about 2010. I might write more about this as a post on its own.\n\nThe fetishization of Judaism was pretty cringey. I see that kind of thing a lot, and it's always a big, fat red flag to me. And I hate when I have a partner that leaves me to do all the 'heavy lifting'. Even if I am the one generating the environment, I expect my partners to... y'know... do things.\n\nI am so, so sorry you are going through this.
