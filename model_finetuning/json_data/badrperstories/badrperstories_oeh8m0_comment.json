            "body": "How are you '100% positive' that a 'random person' is someone you've written with before? It sounds like someone joined a server on an account you've never seen before and you're assuming it's this ex-partner. Unless this is the exact same account that you ghosted before, I imagine it might be worth asking something like, \"Hey are you \\[person\\] from \\[server/site\\]? I think we've written before!\" There's no way to be certain otherwise. \n\nIf it's not the same person, well, at least you know. If it is - you need to be honest with him. Building a relationship on a lie (yes, even one of omission) is just going to result in major fallout down the road if he finds out. Even if it's not a guarantee that he will - would you want to find out after months or years that someone you considered a friend has been lying to you the whole time? \n\nIf it is him, then be honest with him that you only recently recognized him, and you'll understand if he doesn't want to continue the roleplay because of your past behaviour. And then you respect whatever his decision is. No whining, no 'but that's not fair', no 'you have to keep roleplaying with me because that's what I want even though you don't'. \n\nI get the idea that he may have said he no longer wanted to write with you, since you mentioned that you were unable to make amends and he ignored your following messages. If you're considering violating that boundary he set, just because it will mean you get the roleplay you want, then you need to take some more time off the internet.",
