Any RPer who can honestly say that writing is a passion and believes they are good at it can and will avoid ever only giving a one line response.\n\nThe overpowered thing is another issue. Firstly they should be respecting the power level of the other characters around them in an OOC manner, hogging the spotlight and throwing around their character's power without intent to provide story and content to their peers is a sign of immaturity and a poor level of creativity. This is why often these characters are and should only allowed use by smart, thoughtful, and trusted players.\n\nYou can either try and suggest some manner of his character being nerfed in a story way ( which can add content and plot ), tell him not to use it, or use a Weight Class system similar to boxing. If he wants to throw around his strength willy-nilly he should only be allowed to do so on situations and with others of the same power level to keep things fair and the gravity of the situations to be fitting for the characters involved.",

            "body": "Oh boy, keyboard time.\n\n1. You are never obligated to RP with someone, even if they claim \"dibs\". This is not a car seat, or a popsicle, its a roleplay. Especially if they cannot match style, length or time, they don't get to \"call\" OCs for shipping and you have every right to tell them to bugger off or put in the effort to earn the ship. RP ships aren't so different to real life if you're invested enough and it says a lot about their views on love if they think having a crush means you get to claim someone who is their own independent factor in the universe.\n\n2. Don't give a flying fuck about how much time is invested in \"developing\" an OC outside of the server they're in. Whatever adventures they went on over the last 5 years are not relevant nor canon to the server if they didn't happen IN the server unless the owner has explicitly stated so. This is why you should always have back up ideas on how to portray or scale an OC and their powers/story to fit the environment to not break the rules or lore, OR make a new OC. If they can't respect the fact their \"development\" outside of the server universe, which for all intents and purposes is an isolated bubble timeline, doesn't count if the owner says it doesn't, then they don't get to play that character. Period. There is nothing wrong with having multiple timelines for an OC, just because they developed a certain way in one or two groups doesn't mean they will in a new world, with a new server with new people. Have an idea and understanding of your OC, but accept the idea of starting over again to try something new. It might be hard but it doesn't invalidate your time or them as a character, if anything it actually makes them more complex and nuanced.\n\n3. I agree with some of the other ideas shared about how to moderate these problem users, but in the end YOU are the owner and YOU have final say. There is a fine line between being in control and being a tyrant but you won't have the respect of your members if you allow people like this to run amok. You owe them nothing and if the server would run better without them, then trim the fat and call it done.",
