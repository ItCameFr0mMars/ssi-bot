Why use a character that already has a scene when you got two more characters? That\u2019s mostly why I was so tilted.

            "body": "I sincerely question the framing that you somehow think you \"own\" a character temporarily if you're in a scene with them. I have been in multiple advanced-lit heavily-storyline-based RPs where there was no rule that a character couldn't be in two scenes at once. The association of this with \"casual\" roleplay baffles me.\n\nTime does not flow \"realistically\" in an RP format. I've written scenes that in-universe occupied a single evening that took literally months to finish in roleplay because the scenes were so dense and sometimes emotionally taxing to write. Alternatively, I can start something in the past and get it up to speed in the present day over years in a matter of weeks or months. \n\nI'm not tying up my character in a group RP in a single scene for months, not when I can easily say \"this event took place on \\[date\\] IC, and this other event took place on \\[later date\\] IC.\" Storyline-based RP isn't always confined to a single set of railroad tracks.\n\nYeah, I suppose my character could \"die\" in one scene and not actually be able to complete the second scene, but I think I'd be pretty aware going in if my character was going to die in the earlier scene, or be abducted for an indefinite period of time, or be so badly injured they were going to be comatose in a hospital. Those things *shouldn't* come as a surprise. And if there's an unforeseen turn, it's entirely possible to break the scene up so these events happen over days or weeks in order to \"loop in\" other scenes and link them up in the timeline. Basically, it's possible to have a singular, complete timeline while also writing multiple scenes at once. And it's how I like my group RPs.\n\n15 minutes is not a long time to wait for a response after pinging. Maybe they were AFK, or working on something else. There's a human behind that screen who doesn't exist to be at your constant beck and call. Discord is dangerous because you can see when someone is \"online,\" but it doesn't mean \"I'm currently paying attention to Discord.\" (Notably, this is also why so many RPers are constantly set to Busy or Invisible, because we don't like our partners becoming time cops.)\n\nIs there a rule in this server that all interactions in this RP take place in a single sit-down session? Is there a rule in this server that players can't have a character in multiple scenes at once? In that case, I can understand your issues, but otherwise, you ought to step back and not take it so personally. Sometimes one scene is easier to write than others, or one character feels easier to write than others. Just because someone doesn't *immediately* respond to you doesn't mean the scene has been abandoned. It may mean they need a break to work on something else so they can come back to your scene with a fresh and excited perspective, rather than grinding through it.\n\nYou sound a little exhausting to RP with, and this is coming from someone who writes novella-length, advanced-lit posts exclusively on heavy storyline-based roleplay servers, so I'm pretty much the opposite of \"casual.\" I think you ought to examine why you're spending so much time in a server that it seems like you're not having much fun in. RP is about having fun, and different folks have fun in different ways, so it might take some time to find your people, and it sounds like these aren't your people. Just because you don't like the way they roleplay doesn't mean they're doing it wrong, it just means it's not right for you.\n\nThat said, you're right that allowing minors in an RP that has NSFW content is messed up. That, we can agree on.",
