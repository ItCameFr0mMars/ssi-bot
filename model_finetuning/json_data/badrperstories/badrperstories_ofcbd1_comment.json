Not sure where the divide stared between \"talking is for now, texting is for later\" being changed to \"no wait, only word\" but it's super annoying for sure.",

I have a few friends that I chat with like this, and it's all chill. I have another friend that I normally chat in 'real time' with, but during daytime hours she and I default to this mode as well (long chunks of time between responses because we're busy).\n\nSometimes though it is absolutely normal to want to basically chat via text online at the same pace and with the same basic amount of focus that you would give to a conversation that is being spoken. In that case, when possible it's nice to give a 'brb' when you're stepping away from the chat, and a 'good night' when you go to bed if your conversation is active at the time, and *basically* keeping up your side of the conversation.\n\nHonestly it's all about reading the engagement of the conversation you're in, and on managing expectations reasonably.\n\nThe person in the OP sounds really annoying though, OP managed the expectations there just fine it seems, they were just being demanding and strange.",

Or at all, really; I dislike texting and I resent people thinking that they can contact me all the time if I have a cell phone, honestly. \n\n*Texting* though, yeah absolutely it implies a staggered time frame pretty much always, at least that was how I saw it. I just figured OP was talking about chatting and not actual phone texting.\n\nMy post was mostly referring to people who will be there on discord, mid-chat, and will sometimes just *poof* without saying an afk/brb or anything. Discord chatting and texting on a cell phone though are very much two different beasts. It's way more common and 'assumed' that both people will be chatting at the same time on discord, though I still often use it for staggered chatting as well since I don't text.",

With some friends we totally have the rhythm where we just drift in and out of a slow conversation with long gaps and no expectation of when a reply might come and it's all good. \n\nOther times with some friends though that conversation is what we are 'doing', so if they just poof off without sending a 'bbl' or whatnot it basically feels like if you were sitting in your room with the person hanging out and they just got up and walked out without a word. Of course this only applies if we are legit 'hanging out' digitally and they expect *me* to be present and not just go absent for long stretches without saying so either. I had to explain to a friend once that it wasn't fair that she would get up and go take her cat to the park for an hour or so without a word when we were full speed plotting out an RP, but then she'd get upset if I would also walk away from our chat to do other stuff without a word. I was willing to accept/adjust our 'normal' for when we'd be chatting, but it had to go both ways. Basically as long as everyone agrees on a 'norm' then it's chill.\n\nSome people don't 'hang out' in IMs with people though, which makes the situations totally different. I'm a big introvert and my best friends live in a different country so I do the bulk of my socializing in chatrooms with them, which is a bit different from just casual chats, I think.",
