While I predominantly deal with more \"modern\" history I know a great deal about ancient history and I know about other countries history as well. Kinda part of the job.\n\nWhile I don't focus on clothing too much, I can't do historical rps. Predominantly because people get events, timelines, and people messed up. It drives me absolutely mad. I've tried several rps before and I just get so disinterested because people who say they know the history don't know it as well as they say. \n\nIn particular, I have trouble with samurai rps. Lots of people fantisize about them and completely ignore the facts that surround them. For example, a lot of samurais were really terrible people. They were not all valiant heroes that protected the weak. In fact, in many places they terrorized the citizens. Also, it wasn't hard to be a samurai nor were they super loyal to their lords. Which can be discovered by a simple googoe search.  It really ruffles my feathers when I get people who don't want to acknowledge that kind of stuff.\n\n If it was purely fantasy rp, whatever. I don't get miffed by Assassin's creed because it just has a historical setting and they state it is only based on those people. It is still fantasy though. But if you explicitly label something as \"historical\" and you state you want accuracy then make it fucking accurate.\n\n\nPlease excuse writing style and spelling. I am on a phone and quite lazy.",

I admit I thought they were bad because I'd seen how people have *abused* some corsets to achieve sizes that aren't healthy to maintain, but my bestie is a corset enthusiast and after a hands on break down of how to wear one correctly I'm fan, even if they're a bit pricey at times.\n\nThat being said, I definitely get the \"accuracy\" issue since I'm prone to over research things for said accuracy, and since I was a fan of the Sengoku Jidan period (feudal Japan) as well as other interspersed eras that have a lot of details that get glossed over, I tend to stay away from historic pieces. The future can be messed with in infinite ways and fantasy elements are always a wild card, but true historical settings can't really be altered much without losing their essence and at that point you're basically roleplaying a larp session or a Ren faire.

The whole point of this post is me talking about how annoying it is when people talk about how corsets are bad without knowing the actual facts. Corsets weren't nearly as restrictive as people think they were, and tbh I'd wear a corset over an underwire bra any day.
