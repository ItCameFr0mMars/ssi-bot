I bet that they were all \"Sure\" and \"That works\" when you laid out the plan during the brainstorming stage (or to use your analogy with the dog, doing the human equivalent of wagging tail and panting with anticipation). Whenever I get that, I *know* I'm not going to have a good time.\n\nThere's another thing, though. I think level of expertise might also play a role in it, *along* with a person's unwillingness to admit not being well-versed in a topic. I can attest to this, having shamefully done it myself - a dear friend and RP partner, who I've known for years now and done various stories with, suggested a RP involving military themes. And I, despite knowing next to *nothing* about ranks, protocol and just about anything related to military and what military people can plausibly be like... agreed. Long story short, I stuck to my character in that story and I myself felt like I wasn't contributing much (not that my character could do their own thing due to being too low-ranked, while I lacked the confidence to introduce new ones of my own). So it fizzled out.\n\nI guess my advice here is this - the first thing to do when scoping people out, is to chat them up about the topics/genres you want to write about in *general*. The more interesting and varied that chat gets, the more of an indicator it might be, at least in my eyes, that they're *genuinely* interested *and* versed in the types of play you want to do.",

For me, having control of a world and a ton of seperate characters of my own making is something I can find comfort in. I usually always have a plot thought out in my head that has a few branching paths and changes as my partner interacts with the world, and I'm always more than willing to work their own ideas in and take suggestions on what they feel would make things more interesting.\n\nHowever I always have problems when it comes to trying to make a longer story WITH someone. Its mostly out of fear that I might fuck with something that they had planned out but wanted to keep hidden as a surprise, or that I may create a situation that derails an rp entirely and makes things awkward between me and my partner.\n\nNot only that, but of I have a \"main\" character that I control I feel awkward having this character talk with some minor character that I have created just for one interaction. \n\nSo in short I am either the GM or just one character.

To hear them wow over the plot twists and share our mutual love of the characters. I get a big kick out of that.\n\nBut I also write specifically WITH people who are okay with that.

            "body": "NGL, I had this problem a lot as I learned how to write, and to this day I sometimes default back into that more passive \"you do the heavy lifting, and I'll respond to it\" writing. I know that while I was learning how to bulk up my writing, the main trick was to break up the other person's post and then respond to each thing, without necessarily adding to it; which made my writing very purple-prose, fluffy. It took writing with people who were more at my level length wise to see what an issue that was, because I'd get stuck in scenes with people who were just like me - only responding and never adding any actionable content. Once I realized what an issue that was, I started practicing a more 60/40 method, where 60% of my posts were the introspection or responses to the previous post and the other 40% was me taking the scene forward.   \n\n\nIt takes a lot of practice though. Especially when it's a writer who has been role playing for years and feels like their writing is already great. People have to want to change before they can change, ya know? I saw that flaw in my writing and have been working on making it better, but I know so many writers who genuinely believe their 9 pages of fluff with 1 sentence of actionable content at the very end if God's gift to humanity.   \n\n\nI use the Tavern-Corner trope as the perfect example of this. Back in old school AOL RP, when Rhy'din was super popular, there were these really big public tavern chats. You'd go in and every night, without fail, there would inexplicably be no less than 10 mysterious strangers sitting alone in a dark corner sipping bloodwyne. Their writers clearly wanted to RP or they wouldn't have gone through the trouble of posting. But they wanted everyone else to approach them and basically seduce them for their time. It got really tedious, really fast, so those writers would end up making a big OOC fuss about how people were bullying them or refusing to write with them. But on the other hand, common sense dictates that when you see someone in public who doesn't want to be engaged with, you leave them alone. It's the same in RP.   \n\n\nI especially hate it when I get asked to start a scene, so I do, and then they post with their character nowhere near mine and not interacting with them at all. So they're basically forcing me to write two starters. By this point, when someone does that, I just start solo writing. We can either end the scene with our characters never interacting, or they can stop being a dick and engage.",

            "body": "This has been the bane of my existence and the reason I've given up on RP for long stretches several times.  There are a few reasons for it that I can think of, but it should **not** be this prevalent.  \n\n1.) People don't realize that plotting is hard work.  They expect compelling stories to form organically, without actually sitting down and thinking about how personalities will interact and how to add solvable conflicts to a story.  I know that fact seems obvious, and it should be, but when I was new to RP I didn't realize this myself.  I'm ashamed that I forced my first long-term partner to carry almost all of the RP.  She stuck with me and I grew, and in time I got a lot better about contributing.  It was something I had to learn how to do.\n\n2.) Plain old laziness.  They want to be entertained.  They want you to dispense that entertainment.\n\n3.) Mismatched expectations.  Some people are fine with \"he smiled.\"  Some people want a lot of detail.  \"He flashed a long-toothed smile at her, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and waved away her concerns with a flick of his wrist.\"  Person A can't, or doesn't want to, write with the level of detail person B is using, and person B does want that detail so they are forced to make up the difference.  In this case these people are just incompatible as partners.\n\nThere's a second problem you touch on in your post, which is that some people don't want any action or conflict, at all, but they don't know how to communicate this to others.  I can't tell you the number of times this has happened to me, even though I was clearly advertising for action-oriented stories.  I really don't understand the thinking behind that one at all.  I could make a whole post about these experiences.",
