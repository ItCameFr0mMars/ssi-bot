When your character finds out he was wrong his apologies \\[sic\\] to my character but as a playful payback my character decides to punish him. He could give him a potion that makes your character horney \\[sic\\] all day.\u201d\n\nThis would irk me as well, by the way. It sounded alright - can have some drama in such situations, maybe even conflict, a necessary step to make interactions between characters multi-layered - until I read the last sentence. ERP might be fun to me and all, but not when it feels *contrived*. Tacked on. \"And then suddenly - aphrodisiacs!\" -- doesn't add anything to the *story*, it's just there to get someone's rocks off. Ugh.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to actually say here, except that I feel your plight. Planning for **five** sex scenes would get awful boring to me as well.

            "body": "I don't understand it when people say they want to write sex scenes \"only if it adds to the plot.\" I have never been reading a work of fiction and thought \"wow, that sex scene really propelled the plot forward.\" In other words, I've never seen a graphic, detailed sex scene accomplish something that a subtle \"fade to black\" with strong enough implications of sex couldn't have accomplished. \n\nI wonder if you wouldn't be better off just saying \"no smut\" and explaining the nuances of your decision later on, once it's become relevant and at a time you think it might add something. It sounds like you tend to err on the side of not wanting to do it in the first place- which is fine. Your roleplay partner also sounds a little bit like me, unfortunately, where you're describing them as having a lot of scenes they want to skip to versus doing something else in the meantime. For me, I attribute that to my ADHD, and it's part of the reason I haven't finished anything that didn't have a deadline. No matter how much you explain to us here, there's always going to be context between you and \"S\" that we don't have. I wonder if they would be receptive to it if you told them you had another idea for something to do, wanted to use time between scenes for character development and world building. I'm not sure what this fandom is or what the original genre of the story was but I'm banking on it not being erotic or romantic fiction so you could say something like you want to write scenes that are more similar to the original content. \nObviously, if that's something you've already tried, it might not help to just do it again.",

            "body": "I couldn't agree more. To me, it comes down to coming correct on what you want and don't want.   \n\n\nThere are \\*tons\\* of people who love and write ERP. Whatever your particular fetish is, there is someone online right now looking for that exact same thing that is perfect for you. It doesn't take long to figure that out if you are paying attention at all.   \n\n\nI'm personally in the advanced lit/novella camp, and don't write many sex scenes. I feel like the kinds of stories I'm aiming for (and I just mean me) are more like R rated movies. Maybe it's a thriller, an adventure, a horror story, whatever, but think of an actual movie. How weird would it be if in the middle of your 90 minutes with A list actor and actor they stop while being chased by zombies to have a \\*long\\*, extremely detailed and graphic sex scene. Not too many movies even do the old 90s style of sex scenes they used to because it comes across as ham fisted and frankly derailing and weird. \\*Much less\\* a full on porno style sex-capade.   \n\n\nThat said there are definitely some serious films and books out there with steamy scenes, but they tend to be stories that are more centrally focused on the subjects of sex and relationships, or the taboo. I'm not talking about \\*porn\\*, but films like Lolita, Secretary, even Cruel Intentions and the like. The sex isn't an interruption there, it's part of the story, and I can wrap my head around why that is interesting to think about and write. Even arousing in that weird mental-physical way that film or books can be.   \n\n\nI'm a kinky and kink-positive person in life, too. So I get why fetishes are powerful and thinking with the down there brain can make us do weird things. I'm not going to faint puritanically or pretend I'm above it. I have witnessed time and again \"advanced\" level writers do just that and find it pretty laughable if not just distasteful.   \n\n\nStill, I feel like if I am going to write about sex it is at least going to be sex I like in a context I find stimulating. It is \\*NEVER\\* going to be because my partner forces me to write some long, winding (honestly usually too vanilla and boring for me anyway) scene. That's not cool, and it isn't interesting or going to hold my attention.   \n\n\nMy bottom line is this - If you're into something and that is what you are in the mood to write, cool. Do you and lie your best life, but ask for that directly. Do not say you want it \"when it makes sense,\" because it \\*barely\\* makes sense in most stories. Just go looking for what you are after and be upfront with your partners.",
