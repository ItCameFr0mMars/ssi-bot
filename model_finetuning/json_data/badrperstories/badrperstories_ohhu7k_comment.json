I would say don't worry about it, don't feel bad, and just file it away as another one of those oh-so-fun internet experiences.\n\nI'm sorry you didn't have a good time with what could have been a really fun line. I hope you find someone you're more compatible with soon. Best of luck, and don't let this discourage you! There's always going to be those people out there!  \n\n\nEdit: Reddit just totally had a moment and effed my entire comment up.",

Some people, especially those who have searches where a lot of people reply to (which is often the case with more simple searches, because there often isn't a lot that could put people off), have an incredibly strict vetting process. Basically, because they encounter so many red flags (people who did not read their ads, people who don't contribute their own ideas, and so on), they get incredibly frustrated and interpret their partners behavior in the worst possible way. For example, you not being totally sure on which ref to pick could be interpreted as you not having strong opinions on the characters/ref=bad, you saying you don't have any ideas at the moment could be interpreted as not really being interested in the roleplay/you being one of the typical roleplayers who let the other partner decide everything, and so on. As they probably wanted something different from the roleplay (more action, more romance, who the hell knows) they had no fun and people like that often don't communicate what they really want (for example, maybe their weird ask about third person was a hint that didn't like something about your writing style and wanted to check if you were only writing that way because you are uncomfortable writing in third person). \n\nIf they had very bad experiences with people, they often do not give other people the benefit of the doubt, and it causes them to be extremely irritable and sometimes outright rude, while they probably thing 'Meh, this person is just like (bad roleplayer they met before), no need to cuddle them'. Often, they don't even notice their own rudeness or that maybe, their suspicions are not justified and instead, they became the bad roleplayer.\n\n2.) Another issue that comes with simple and sweet searches: basically, often even the rudest roleplayers will find someone who will write their stories with them. That causes them to be rude, demanding, and not communicate properly. Because even if your roleplay fails, they can just move on to the next roleplayer who applied for their idea. Often these people are like: when it is not perfect and funny all the time, I will just move on, no need to fix any issues, I will find a good match eventually. They just don't care if they are being rude, because it has zero negative consequences for them, especially on places like reddit if there isn't a real community which calls out such behavior.\n\n3.) There are just an entitled asshole for not deeper reason, they want to have fun, they did not have fun and they did not waste any time on politeness. Sadly, a lot of roleplayers like this exist.",

            "body": "You're not the asshole, you've done absolutely *nothing* wrong *and* you have the *full* right to be irritated, except... Don't do it. Try to be as little irritated as possible, it's not worth it. You'll be wasting brain cells on someone who's an a-hole on *multiple levels*. I've made the mistake of doing it, regretted doing so in the first place, so just... try to forget about this whole fiasco, and the sooner it happens, the better.\n\nBy the way, I *love* the way you think, then again I share the same stances/philosophies when it comes to RP. I also agree with the red flags you've found in BadRPer here.\n\nWere I in your place, though, I would have cut it short the moment I got the first 'whatever'. Call me weird, but I can't stand it when someone gives me replies like *that* OOC, it's both disrespectful and kills any interest. Also, you're absolutely right - sometimes what it takes to arrive to a *great* story is a great OOC chat before it, and you don't need to approach with an idea. I'd also argue that doing simple RPs can inspire to a more complex one and *easily* so, but that's off-topic.\n\nAlso, I'll never understand people who send a bajillion refs and then go, \"Oh, not THAT one!\" (like... *why* link it if it's not of interest, then??) or did like your Bad did - sound like they weren't at all impressed by your choice. I don't know why people do that, is it some sort of next-level 'big brain' test? Like they're able to deduce things about you just from your pick or something... :D\n\nAnd finally, stating *\u201cEh I dunno you aren\u2019t really fun\u201d*  at the *end* of a RP session is just... just, wow... I've had this happen to me once, too. Why do people do *this* as well? Go through *hours* of play that's... not fun for them, and instead of cutting it short, they state so at the *end*? Why?",
