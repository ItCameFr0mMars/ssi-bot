At best it's 3 months, at worse it's 2 weeks or even 2 days. \n\n2. Ran on blind optimism in hopes I would one day find a rp group I\u2019ll love to be in for years. It made me blind to reflect on my feelings and reasons for rping. \n\n3. Came on this sub to post my bad rp stories\u2026quite \u201cfrequently\u201d Idk feels like I have myself a red flag cause I had all these bad rp stories from so many rp sites in almost less than a year. \n\n4. I have to say again, Roleplaying is/should be a fun hobby to do as a pastime. It should not JUST be used to fill in an empty part of your life whether that's social or w/e because at the end of the day it's a hobby involving other people. It's going to promote selfishness and obsessive behavior if people relied on it that.  \n\n5. Others calling out on said obsessive behavior. \n\nThe biggest one is still feeling alone even though you're doing a semi-social hobby.",
