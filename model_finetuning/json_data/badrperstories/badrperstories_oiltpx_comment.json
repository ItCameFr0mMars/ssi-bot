The decent rpers are pretty sparse these days due to the fact they're usually living their life; so the shit people are becoming more obvious as time goes on. \n\nWhile things have certainly gotten worse, the rp community has always had major problems as far as I can remember (I've rped for a little over a decade). When I was a kid, I've actually had two adults (one 18 and one 22) rp rather graphic sexual things with me. This is despite the fact I explicitly TOLD both of them I was an 11 year old. The 22 yr old tried to manipulate me into video calling him naked after the rp. When I couldn't think of anymore excuses to stall him and refused; he actually threatened to kill himself. Luckily I had just enough common sense to not give into that demand \\[as I was in a pretty terrible place at that time and desperate for ANYONE'S approval\\]. Luckily I was also pretty educated in comparison to many other 11 yr olds in regards to what grooming looked like beforehand; so he didn't really get anything from me.\n\nBut to get back on topic; there's honestly a lot of people that pretty much don't read anything you post these days. I've actually had someone refer to one of my characters as a 'doctor' when he is a Nurse (which is a very different position), REPEATEDLY. I politely corrected them both IC and OOC twice before I just dumped them without a word. I've practically had at least maybe 10 since people since the start of this year who pretty much ignore what I write or say. I think it's pretty common nowadays due to the fact that most decent rpers are usually too busy living their lives to really rp anymore. The decent rp partners I've had usually had to dip out due to the fact they end up becoming busier than they expected.",

            "body": "I think that another problem is the anonymity of some communities, especially on reddit. In a forum with like...50 members, people who apply for every search and then do not follow through or even try to force smut often have a bad reputation and after a while don't find any partners anymore, except maybe newbies. But like you said, people don't have any repercussions if nobody knows what they are up to. \n\nI did not notice an increase though, these experiences have plagued my roleplay experience since I started. I don't write romance or smut, so I often noticed straight away that something was off when their ideas all had a focus on that. Especially if you want to write something that most people do not like, it becomes much more blatant that the ideas don't really match and they haven't read your search at all. If I get five messages for a search, I just assume that maybe 1-2 are genuinely interested and don't get my hopes up. If something works out, great! If not, I start searching again. And I don't argue/compromise with people anymore that want to push the roleplay in a completely different direction, because I realized that this just wastes my time and it is better to move on. \n\nI think that there might be multiple reasons why it seems worse: more people got into the hobby, at least I noticed an increase in the popularity anime roleplays since anime also became a lot more popular, and some got into it because of stuff like critical role. And I noticed that a lot of people mistake normal roleplaying for cybersexting, and don't even seem to get that not everyone who is interested in roleplaying is also interested in sexual content. \n\nIt could also be possibly that you are searching for different things now, for example I noticed that people who searched for rather basic fxm love stories with a not very detailed plot often did not notice at first when they encountered the typical 'I did not really read your ad' type of guy, because their search was so basic that even if someone had not read it, it was harder to notice than, let's say with someone who searches for a veeery detailed plot in a specific fandom with highly detailed preferences. A lot of people I know say stuff like 'Well, nobody ever forced ME to write smut!' and then you find out they are always for writing it, so why should anyone feel the need to force them to do it?",
