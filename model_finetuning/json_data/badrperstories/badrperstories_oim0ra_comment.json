We've reclaimed a lot of things that sed to be associated with her, and it's so nice to be able to write without tiptoeing around someone else's feelings and jealousies. I support S in his art in a way that she never could (she was envious of his talent), and he epitomizes what it means to be a true friend. She truly missed out on both of us because of her own insecurities. \n\nWriting this was the final thing I needed to do to close the chapter. There were a lot of revelations we've both had over the course of about three months (since we did NC) - and all I can say is that it's amazing how clear things become when you no longer care about someone or what they think of you.\n\nI've learned only to give myself to people who do not wish me harm. That brings me peace. :) Thank you again.",
