But I do like to do faux-historical flavored post apocs or gaslamp fantasies, so then I like to at least glance at what people did and said during the era we're sort of imitating rather than just have everyone pop up talking like a Joss Whedon character with the \"sort of likes\" and \"okays.\"  And if someone's going to be captured and forced to work on a cane plantation, as in one of my current rps, then I like to look up how historical plantations were run and at least hew somewhat close to that.  (The answers are horrible, but I was expecting that.)  I'll have a character use a buttonhook to get her fanciest dress on and off.  Things like that.  I don't have a ton of partners who will respond by doing research in turn, but I do get one once in a while, and it always tickles me when I do.",

            "body": "Heya! There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing research in your RP\u2019s, whether it\u2019s about a certain time period, or if it\u2019s a historical event that you wanna get the accuracy right on the point. I\u2019ve had my fair shares of doing RP\u2019s whether it\u2019s during World War 2, medieval times, or even sci-fi. \nI definitely understand where you are coming from. I always tend to make sure that not a single detail is left out, and I always make sure to be as accurate as I can be with my writings.\nBefore I even start doing an RP, I always ask my partners what they are craving for; whether it\u2019s a historical drama we wanna do in the Victorian times, a battle during Vietnam War, or a rebel going against the government that\u2019s taken place in the year 3035. \n\nSome helpful tips to have your partner be interested in a topic is maybe showing them a picture of what you had in mind, give them a snippet of what you wanna do. A super easy way is even creating a Pinterest board. Some partners are more of a visual learner, so showing them pictures of what you had in mind with that event would definitely help! Even videos too! Now, if your partner isn\u2019t keen on doing that topic or they wanna do something different, there could be other topics that they thoroughly enjoy that you might find common ground with. \nI hope this wasn\u2019t too much, but I wish you well in your future writings! :)",

            "body": "&gt;...but I try really hard to make sure I get everything mostly right.\n\nI think this is the only thing that seemed a little uppity in your post. Some people don't care about being 'right,' they just want to use their imaginations. Other than that your post is valid.\n\nThe thing about roleplay is everyone has a different reason that they enjoy doing it. Roleplaying is a hobby; people roleplay for the story, for the smut, for the enjoyment of working collaboratively on a piece of fiction, to blow off steam, etc. Some just want to get lost in a story and don't have much interest in doing extensive research; that takes time. It can be exhausting. Considering how much it takes to set up a good story\u2014developing plot, developing interesting characters, etc.\u2014adding on more research can make the task of roleplaying feel like a chore. \n\nWhat I think you're experiencing is just the regular bumps of finding a compatible roleplay partner. Partner compatibility is the biggest factor, imo, in the longevity of a storyline. For some reason, on this sub especially, roleplayers lament on the actual searching it takes to find a compatible partner. Personally, I don't get it. It's **okay not to be compatible with the first person who answers your ad/whose ad you answered.** Move on. Keep searching. Sifting through all the oysters to find the pearl has ALWAYS been worth it in my opinion. I've culled 3 longterm rp partners over the past 5 years and I'm never letting them go. Did I rp with other people in those five years? Yes. Of course. But things didn't vibe, I enjoyed what we did end up writing, and then let it go once I decided I was no longer enjoying it. \n\nPoint being, it's okay to feel this way, it's okay to be enthusiastic, but you can not control your rp partners. If you aren't happy, keep the search up :)",

            "body": "Probably for the best. And I mean... I get where someone that knows this stuff would be annoyed, but it says a lot about their care of subject by comparison.\n\nThough that's not given that fact Shinto doesn't have a very common not accurate portrayal in anime most of the time; even Japan is guilty of exaggerating their religious magic system to confusing degrees and because of the ubiquity of the existence of Shinto and Buddhism, a lot of details are just assumed to be known, which doesn't work in the favor of foreign viewers. But also easily remedied with a good search.\n\nThe eras thing I think doesn't get touched on because it's just not an in demand time period for stories. Everyone wants the warring states and ancient Edo period because it's fanciful and magical. Which is honestly disappointing because some of the better stories have occured when the \"out with the old\" started, but it may only be appreciated by nerds.\n\nAs for the last, I'm even more terrified to ask for those details because even with a cursory look, it shouldn't be hard to be noble lady in an old setting in Japan. At least passably. I've got nothing for that otherwise.\n\nAll points stand though, that a little time on google would fix those issues so I have no idea how to miss them without willful choice to do so. And for that I'm sorry you have to put up with it and I hope it gets better for you, I'm going to go scratch my head at this whole thing for a bit.",

            "body": "Yeah, I haven't done very deep research into Shinto/Buddhist beliefs myself except when it's relevant since I'm more interested in the mythological side of things: the stories of the gods, yokai, other mythological figures, etc. So I don't expect anyone to know all the little details but knowing about the general details certainly makes thing more authentic. Now that I say it though, it falls more under the Japanese mythology umbrella than the Shintoism umbrella but they have some overlap.\n\nThat's very true, and I admit that I do fall under that category at times of mostly going a more Sengoku/Edo Period setting. I do think other eras would be interesting to try out though, like the Taisho Era (but you'll probably only get that from a Kimetsu no Yaiba roleplay honestly).\n\nBack to the point of era names though, I bring it up because I have yokai characters that are from older eras so they may bring up the changing of eras, so it's only really relevant in those cases.\n\nI won't say because I don't want to make it obvious who I'm talking about in case they stumble upon this post somehow. But yes, I agree, I don't know every detail about Japanese princesses and what they do but I know they probably can't do what this person says their character does. I can believe a princess that can wield a sword or a bow, even if it may not have actually been a thing, but I can't believe much more than that without a very clear reason.\n\nI'll keep trying my best to persevere though and perhaps link sources to specific things I mention for my partners but I'll probably just let some storylines go if it feels like I'm the only one who puts in the effort. Thank you for your response though, and I wish you luck with your head scratching because I'm still doing the same.",

            "body": "I think the princess thing is dependant on the story plausibility, circumstances and her family I guess. I would assume archery and kendo would be **available** to a princess should her parents decide it was needed or of no consequences to learn, but I doubt a demure and proper princess would be allowed to if it went against her image. I'm fairly certain at some point, they were expected to be living dolls, sitting in their many kimono and meant to look pretty and well behaved. I might be wrong there but that's generally how they were treated at certain instances so....\n\nHonestly not sure where to go with that. My scratching intensifies.",
