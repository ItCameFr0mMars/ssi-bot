I'm a pretty solid fade to black roleplayer, so I wouldn't even be in any legal danger, I just have no interest in being some kid's 30-something online friend. \n\nI recognize that for folks much closer to either side of the great 18 divide, things can get murky, however. If you're in that age bracket where there's a lot of crossover between writing ability and casual chat styles, my recommendation is to check the experience gap and other telltale signs of someone being a high schooler (schedule, not living on their own, etc.).
