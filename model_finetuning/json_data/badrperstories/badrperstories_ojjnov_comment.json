Are their one liners breaking an agreement you had? If so, then there's obviously an issue. Otherwise, I'd recommend talking to them about what they like in RP and what you're both looking for. \n\nI wouldn't be able to RP with someone who does those sorts of one-liners either (though I will fight with my dying breath that it is possible to write a good one-liner, they just have their place) but I think a lot of roleplayers get hung up on length. \n\nThe problem I see with with \"he nodded his head\" or \"she shrugged\" is *not* the length, it's that it doesn't \"yes-and\" the scene. They're relying on *you* to advance the story because they aren't writing collaboratively. \n\nIf you came at it not from the angle of \"quit writing one liners and instead write the length I want\" and instead \"I'm struggling because your responses are requiring me to do all the leg work of advancing the story\" you may be more successful because you're explaining why the one liners are creating a problem for you, not simply getting into an argument about aesthetic taste and preference. \n\nAfter all, I've seen people write paragraphs and novellas that don't advance the story any more than \"she shrugged\" does, and if you make this an issue of length rather than collaborative forward propulsion of the narrative, you could get a paragraph-long response that amounts to \"she shrugged.\" Similarly, I've seen one liners that cracked the earth open and just left devastation in their wake, because that single sentence shot through the narrative like a bullet, its brevity only enhancing its horrible effectiveness through the contrast to the typical narrative pace.",
