It could lead to one partner being treated unfairly.\n\nFrom OP's post, it sounds like this is the type of roleplayer that gets bored of waiting so they get themselves into a situation where they've already started a roleplay with someone, but they are impatient and decide to go ahead and look for a new partner to roleplay with, but then the old partner comes back. \n\nI'm glad they showed their true colors and didn't lead OP on any further because 9 times out of 10, continuing with them wouldn't have ended well. Many people are guilty of doing this while waiting for their old partner to come back. What often happens is they'll end up ghosting you or everyone because they overwhelm themselves (I've witnessed this on many occasions, and often times they'll chalk it up to \"forgetfulness\" but that still doesn't make it any less inconsiderate.)",
