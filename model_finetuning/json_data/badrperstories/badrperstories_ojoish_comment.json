            "body": "1. Mods need to offer actual weaknesses or some other means by which the humans can fight back because numbers (5 humans to 1 SB for example) means nothing if an SB is powerful enough to take out 3-7 humans in their own with their BS powers.\n\n2. The power scaling is extremely unbalanced just at a glance unless the mods have or will include limits to the powers of the SB (which basically sound like fae) such as tolls for their use of power, reasonable comparable limits or durations, or specific circumstances in which to use them (such as in Bayonetta, witches can only wall walk under the light of the full moon).\n\n3. Having a \"tactic\" for humans to use that is directly mitigated by an SB ability is not a real weakness because it's hard to exploit. A secondary effect? Maybe. But it needs to be tacked on to an actual explained weakness or fault, not left as a half assed only. They need to explain iron and it's effects properly and publicly.\n\n4. Having mods be the only reason one side doesn't nuke the other is a red flag, because \"they wouldn't genocide\" is a moral preference. There is ALWAYS a party willing to go to extremes to get what they want unless they can actually explain properly why the SBs wouldn't, not just that they don't, such as a religious reason or moral hive mind preventing that avenue from being available. \"Just because\" is not a good world building model unless there's reason for it, like \"because magic\" to prevent overthinking magic powers, or if it will be revealed in story or through development letter on. If you have no confidence in this, then it's bad world building to hand wave their own oversights.\n\n5. While underdog stories can be great, like \"Independence Day\" where they were vastly out powered but got really lucky in scoring a lethal blow to the aliens, it only works if the admins at competent enough to have set rules to figure out. If they don't appear to have any or find ways to nerf attempts to figure out the SBs then it's not a good balance and they just want to power trip. If you don't think they're going to do that, then you're better off leaving.\n\nAll that being said, if they had a list of \"human advantages\" or fewer powers for the SBs to make use of (lower it from 12 to 8 or create categories so the SBs are forced to have limits and diversify) that way they're still \"strong\" but can be balanced, as well as I would hope the SBs are in minority so the humans do have a chance in fighting a numbers battle at least? My gut says otherwise though.\n\nIf I were you, I'd cut and run before getting involved.",

Either through numbers limits, powers limits or even the evil Dice Roller effect to make all chances fair.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of to test the staying power is to see if there's a way to subdue an SB and subject them to experiments to determine what they're weak to and see what the admins allow. If they have plans under wraps that need to be \"discovered\" then directly investigating them will show that, but if they keep shrugging off attempt to narratively balance the SBs to the humans then it's basically a confirmed power fantasy.\n\nI get it, humans suck, and playing as humans tends to suck, but they at least deserve a chance at doing what humans do best at fighting back. Now, if it were a prequel to an apocalypse level scenario where humans are pushed to the brink of existence and are meant not to stand a chance, then that would be kind of cool, but that needs to be handled carefully and at least noted in the server somewhere to the players that \"things will go badly so try and focus on survival\" that way they aren't caught off guard if they all suddenly die or something.\n\nSo saying, I hope you find a new server before things go badly, but also that this is all paranoia talking and that it won't go badly at all",

            "body": "This does sound poorly conceived if it's legitimately supposed to be a *war* RP. \n\nAs someone who routinely plays in supernatural roleplays, I typically like when some supernatural beings are overpowered to hell and back, because it makes for a good horror element and a lot of creativity in how to find non-deadly resolutions to scenarios that could be much more easily resolved through death. If you choose to play a human in a world that has demons and vampires and werewolves, you're at a disadvantage. Them's the breaks. That said, I think the reason this ends up working out well is the implicit OOC expectation that these characters *aren't* going to go around killing one another (apart from the occasional planned PC death).\n\nHonestly I don't think it would make sense for humans to have a bunch of special abilities, 'cause that kinda defeats the purpose of a humans vs. supernaturals roleplay, but if it's gonna be a war RP, humans ought to have some sort of significant advantage on their side to keep them from getting obliterated. Even something as simple as how in the Shadowrun lore, human characters are *luckier* than other species. As written, this RP concept would function much better if only one side were made up of PC characters, or as a horror/dystopian RP vs. two presumably equal sides in a war. \n\nAre there any mods who have significant characters (not a throwaway character clearly made in the interest of getting them killed and/or just to appear impartial) on the human side?

            "body": "Tangent, but: I think it takes more than OOC chat (although, planning and collaborating with one's partner OOC is crucial and cannot be understated, particularly in scenes where there are major IC consequences) and actually comes down to creating a character who has a compelling motivation to *not* use their absurd powers to just obliterate a city block of human characters. I like to play overpowered \"evil\" characters in a roleplay (in settings where this type of character is welcome and appropriate) and treat it as a character design puzzle to determine why they aren't going to go murderhobo on everyone who goes up against them, because I can anticipate this will be *an issue* in the storyline and having characters constantly \"barely escape\" just makes the powerful character seem incompetent and is boring for me to RP. But, like, what if the super-powerful \"evil\" character doesn't *want* to kill humans? A character that prefers to avoid killing will find IC alternatives to killing that aren't \"the mods said I couldn't kill other people's characters.\" Since the motive comes from within, it becomes character development vs. a grudging respect for the thinly-veiled rules that make RP functional. Even better, the character can drive plot lines and conflict. Plus, it's more fun for me to write a character who is making proactive choices vs. having their hand forced all the time. An example of this would be \"This character is a demon. They don't want to kill humans, because then that amounts to one less soul they can try to make a deal for.\"\n\n(TL;DR: we can assume most people don't want their character killed, ergo, if you're writing an overpowered and deadly character, give them an in-character motivation to not kill other characters.)\n\nYeah I'm not convinced one character on the human side is a much better position, since this could be a character who is being set up for a tragic death. How many mod/admin characters are on the SB side? If it's super uneven, I think it's fair to conclude the outcome of this war is pre-determined, which is *fine*, provided they're transparent about it, but that doesn't seem to be the case.",
