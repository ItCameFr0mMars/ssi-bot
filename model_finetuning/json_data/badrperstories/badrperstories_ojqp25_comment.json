I know I can not pass a fair judgment. But I do feel if they did know they were going to be busy moving, they shouldn't have been trying to start up an RP with someone who has in their ads they want about 3 posts a day.

You want a partner who is as enthusiastic as you are; not someone you have to constantly \"remind.\" If they're into the RP, they'll remember it.\n\nI suggest looking for other partners in the meantime!
