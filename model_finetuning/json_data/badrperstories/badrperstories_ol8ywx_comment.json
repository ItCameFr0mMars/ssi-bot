They would send me crying emoji or asking what they did wrong after 24 hours of no response from me or if they saw me online when they sent a post. It was really exhausting to constantly worry about this other person's emotions. I understood they had been ghosted before, but I had to constantly 'prove' that I wouldn't. \n\nIt's become the reason why I keep my online status as invisible because I'm not interested in feeling bad about wanting to log into discord to hang out with friends only to be attacked with sad pm's about how I'm about to abandon someone.",
