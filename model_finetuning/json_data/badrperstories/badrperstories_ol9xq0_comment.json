Those people will often undermine what others have or actively resent it, and that's a very unhealthy and toxic way to express jealousy.\n\nThe fact that you can respect someone else's efforts and good characters shows that you are very mature.

I have never in 20+ years of RP had a good roleplay experience with a person who was rudely sarcastic, unenthusiastic, or snarky OOC. Rude folks get dropped in a flash. I see a lot of BadRPerStories where people say, \u201cthey were horribly unpleasant OOC, but I ignored it in hopes the RP would be good.\u201d If you find yourself thinking this, just run away.\n\nThey require photographic proof that you, the player, are the gender you claim to be.\n\nAnother cliche, but generally speaking, if they call women \u201cfemales,\u201d they\u2019re bad news and probably creepy.\n\nTheir ad includes language such as, \u201cif you want to get my attention,\u201d or \u201cif you impress me.\u201d Usually indicates they\u2019re looking to be entertained and it\u2019ll be a one way street.\n\nThey complain about all their past RP partners, or go on an anti-ghosting rant immediately.\n\nTheir characters appear to be good at just about everything and their \u201cweaknesses\u201d are the kind you\u2019d write in a resume. There is no room for your character in the story if theirs can do everything they can (and better) and more.\n\nThey\u2019re weirdly insistent on trying to shoehorn an element into your story (there HAS to be a scene where your character loses her shoes and has to wrestle inflated balloons with her naked feet!) that seems left field to you. 9 times out of 10 they\u2019re trying to slide their fetish past you.

            "body": "An ad that includes some mention of how they have trouble keeping partners, never have luck with people who answer their ads, consistently get ghosted, etc. If it's everyone, it's you. Also why are you trash-talking past partners, even indirectly, as your opening to try to attract new partners...?\n\nAds that refuse to discuss triggers or limits. Please. Please just tell me what topics to avoid. I'm not gonna judge. I'm also not gonna wander blindly through a minefield in the hopes that we don't run into any of them. And I honestly don't trust people to suddenly become capable of communication after they've been squicked/triggered.\n\nConversely, ads that go into detail about how something was ruined by past partners or otherwise unloading emotional trauma. I don't need to read a full paragraph about how you used to do xyz but now you've just had so many bad experiences that you can't any more. Related to the first point, why are you airing your past grievances?\n\nActing surprised about preferences or boundaries I set in my ad or in the carrd linked in my ad. Surely you read it in its entirety before you DMed me. Surely you know about my post length and limits and preferred genres and everything else plainly laid out. Right? *Right?* (Spoiler alert: wrong.) Also, trying to skirt around a boundary. If I say 'no' and you say 'well what if-', our conversation is over.\n\nJumping right into making friends, especially if it means a lot of venting or complaining. I don't mind chatting OOC, but if someone starts acting like we're besties within a week of us starting chatting, I'm immediately leery of clinginess and OOC/IC blurring. I'm also not going to be your shoulder to cry on or your therapist, random internet stranger. Sorry not sorry.\n\nReplying with 'yes' or 'idk' to a question with multiple suggestions. If I ask whether you want to do x or y, and I get back 'sure', that's an immediate enthusiasm-killer. Are you not paying attention to what I'm saying? Are you unwilling or unable to contribute to plotting? Are you unwilling or unable to say you don't like either option?\n\nShowing up with a completely fleshed-out idea and setting with preset details about my character. I don't mind something vague like 'a former childhood friend now in her 20s' but if you already have my character's personality and family life and history decided, I have zero room to make that character my own. And usually zero room to have any influence on the setting or plot in any way. \n\nAnyone who wants to play a character who abuses or manipulates mine is an instant end to things. So is a character described as always being threatening or aggressive - for one thing, it's gonna make character interactions a nightmare, and for another, it's frankly disturbing as shit to hear that your favourite character maims and kills just about everyone they meet.\n\nOr if their character is vastly more powerful than mine. If my character is going to be outshone at every turn, you clearly have no idea how to play well with others, and there's no point to me or my character being involved if your character is ten times better than mine no matter what comes their way.

            "body": "\\-when everything you write ooc evokes an overly enthusiastic response by them. I mean for example, all of your ideas in the planning phase (even if it is rather basic) are the beeest ideas they have ever seen, they basically treat you like a genius and so on.\n\n\\-they try to make you feel weird for not writing certain things even if they don't explicitely tell you to include them. Like not saying that you have to include romance, but always saying stuff like 'Did you know that they are many different kinds of love? Even if your character...' or 'Isn't it normal for EVERYONE to hope for that special someone?' or insinuating that you are childish for not writing it. But when you approach the issue and restate your boundary, they act annoyed and tell you that of course, they have read your search, they know.\n\n\\-people being extremely nice to you, but vilifying their former partners for minor issues. Always calling them bitch, cunt, asshole, describing how they want them to face the consequence of their actions... and then you find out that nothing that serious happened between them, the other person just told them that they are not a good match or something like that. \n\n\\-shaming everyone who has different preferences in their ad. For example, long rants about how they don't write fxm or slice of life because it is boring and only boring people write it, they don't use a certain faceclaim because this faceclaim doesn't look like a 'real man' and nobody else should use it, they don't write any Smut because only incels do, and all that stuff that makes you think that they attach a weird morality/ideology to the stuff they write, and that they think they have the moral high ground and can tell others that their preferences are bullshit. Nothing against boundaries, not at all, but you don't have to act like everyone who writes different stuff than you do is an idiot or automatically a creep.\n\n\\-people who have the perfect ad about a popular topic with a lot of upvotes or comments expressing interest, but still they never seem to find any partners that are up to their standards.",

            "body": "I agree with pretty much all of these comments.\n\nI've also learned to back-search a potential partner's screen name if possible. It's okay to separate an rp account from your others, that's not my issue (and I do it, I'm also SomewhatLessRelevant).  It's that it has sometimes happened that I look at an ad that looks decent, but something strikes a slightly off chord.  Then when I look at their other posts, it's like this person I saw yesterday, where all their ads and writing prompt ideas *seem* original and yet somehow all of them include or facilitate a fetish when taken as a whole.\n\nYesterday it was a prompt that seemed well written, but used its fantasy framework to facilitate a magical male to female transformation.  And I am not talking about the way transpeople usually write.  I'm talking about a character \"feeling lighter\" and looking in the mirror and gasp, they have long hair and boobs, the way it would happen in certain types of anime, rather than the sensation of internal change, or immediately understanding your body isn't your body any more, or any of the difficult implications where you have to relearn to walk in a smaller body without falling constantly and peeing is different and awkward now and you have to deal with menses.  No, you look in the mirror and long hair and boobs.  That's what makes a woman.\n\nSo anyway, that seemed oddly specific.  A lot of their previous ad contents were deleted by them (also suspicious).  The remaining ones and writing prompts all had some kind of anime-style sex and gender transformation theme, like \"you're chosen as a magical girl, but are a boy!\"\n\nI don't respond to overt fetish prompts, because it's never one I share (I'm a freak, what can I say), but at least that incest guy whose posts constantly appear is being honest about what he wants.  Never mentioning you have a fetish but all your stuff is about it is just incredibly creepy.\n\nChecking post history where possible is also a good way to find out if someone is into some weird politics or is just incredibly mean about a group of people they don't like, also things I want to know before committing to a potentially years-long writing partnership.  Once I was asked about a 40k rp by a guy who was a \"historical reenactor\" always playing as a Nazi or doing alt history games and rps where Nazis won.  I asked him about it in my first message and never got an answer, but I've always felt that was a dodged bullet.",
