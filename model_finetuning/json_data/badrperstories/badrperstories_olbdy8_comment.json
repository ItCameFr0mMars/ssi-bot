            "body": "I'm going to respectfully disagree. The \"reluctant protagonist\" or \"refusal of the call\" does not usually work well in roleplay. They work in popular media because the person writing the character and the person who is writing the plot who ensnares the character are typically the same person.\n\nIt is the responsibility of a roleplay plot/setting to have \"hooks\" that characters can integrate themselves into, but I don't agree that this ought to be done with no effort on the player/character's part and that the plot must come and drag the player into it.\n\nNovels, movies and popular media =/= roleplay. Due to the collaborative nature of roleplay, and the fact that, quite literally, every RP character is the hero of their own story on screen (vs. side characters vs. protagonists in most popular media) you can't take your plotting cues from popular media which tends to have a hierarchy of more/less important characters. \n\nRoleplay characters who tend to be successful in my experience *want* something and have goals they actively pursue. I have been wildly successful at inserting myself into group roleplays and their storylines by writing characters who want things, are proactive, have agency and seek out/generate conflict. Wallflowers who wait for the plot to arrive at their doorstep are frequently doomed to fail because their vibe is \"I want you to do all the work, you're lucky I've graced you with my presence.\" I can't tell you the number of times I've had someone roll up into my DMs and basically demand I figure out all the details of a storyline so that the plot my character is embroiled in (and does not *need* more people in it to function) can whisk them away. It's exhausting and I'm not interested in one-sided plotting. \n\nEven if you want the plot to come to your character, vs. your character coming to the plot, it is *your job* to come with an idea as to how that will happen. This is your character, I feel like it should be rather evident that you are exponentially more interested in getting them involved than everyone else is, so why should they be putting in more effort than you are? Other roleplayers do not exist to entertain you at your whim and center your character in their narratives. I have some more shy/reactive characters in my arsenal, and my observations are, as much as I personally adore them: 1) it is exponentially harder to get them involved in a storyline than a character who will go and grab the plot by the reigns and 2) when I do get them involved, it is still because I did the majority of the legwork in figuring out how to get them involved, even if IC another character or circumstance pulled them into it. \n\nI don't think it's talked about much on this forum, but one of the best ways to fail to get integrated into a roleplay is to have an attitude of, \"I'm here, now entertain me.\" Wanna get involved in an RP fast? Come with your own ideas. I've found that, even if those ideas don't get picked up, it shows a spirit of creativity and collaboration which is more attractive to a lot of plot-based RPers than \"anyone want to RP something\" is going to be.",

They won't care about your plot and end up running stuff for their own clique and ignoring yours, further increasing the barrier to entry for any newcomers. \n\nOne time I saw one of those things happening where one player did everything he could **to** get involved but they just kept brushing him aside and ignoring him.

Generally speaking, even \"Active\" protagonists have to have *something* to make them act and want to grab that plot hook. \n\nLike Tintin for example - even when he *is* butting his nose in peoples' business, trouble often comes to him. This is also why in my rant, I mentioned things like \"Give them a puzzle piece - then have something happen because of it\". Ie, Tintin obtains one of the puzzle pieces (The model of the unicorn, more specifically the Parchment inside), immediately some people wnat to buy it off of him for varying reasons. He says no, so one of them breaks into his house and steals it - but when they find the parchment isn't in there, assume he has it and keep on pursuing him. This causes him to wonder \"Why do they want this so badly...?\" so he investigates. \n\nIf the plot hooks seem to go *around* the characters, they're not going to bite - *especially* if they're doing everything they can *to* get involved.",

            "body": "I never said it was a must. I even pointed out that I have written reactive/passive characters. \n\nMy major point, however, is that roleplay is a different form of writing than books or movies. Citing books and movies in your argument complicates the issue, because the narrative mechanics of books and movies are inherently different from the narrative mechanics of roleplay. Books, television shows, pre-scripted RPGs and movies have a singular narrative vision. There is a narrative *hierarchy* of more/less important characters. Roleplay is a *democratic* medium. There are not (or should not be) \"main characters\" or \"protagonists\", and the storylines are developed through collaboration with a great deal of improvisation and random chance. \n\nI don't disagree with you that it's a jerk move to obstruct people who are trying to get involved in a plot. This is not in the spirit of roleplay, and is likely an act of self-sabotage. \n\nWhat I am arguing is that it *is* the responsibility of the player to write a character who can plausibly get involved in the plot, and that, even if the *character* is passive or reactive, the *player* should be actively working to get them hooked in the plot. If they're obstructed from doing so, this is not the player's fault. However, there's nothing stopping the player from presenting their own ideas on how to get involved in a plot (even if their character is reactive) vs. waiting for the plot to come to them. \n\nYes, even active characters need a reason to get hooked in the plot, but what stops the player from coming up with those reasons themselves? I'm just confused by this assumption that these reasons should be *provided* for the player, and that the player is powerless to control their own characters' destiny.",
