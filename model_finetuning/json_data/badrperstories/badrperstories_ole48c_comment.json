For one thing, I don't trust some random internet stranger to only do it when they have a reason. Or to give my character a chance to fight back rather than one-shotting them.\n\nAnd if my character's dead, that's going to end whatever plots I have. I'm gonna be really mad if months or years of hard work is ended with 'and then my character got mad and shot yours in the face' or some such. Plus in group roleplay, that's going to mess up a bunch of other peoples' plots if mine is suddenly dead.\n\nI think it's also just really damn rude to impose consequences on someone against their will. People put immense effort and heart into creating characters. It's only natural that they want to keep those characters alive. Any site or group that takes away a player's ability to veto plots that permanently affect/change their character is one that's going to turn into a clusterfuck.\n\nThere can be plenty of in-game consequences besides character death. Maybe the losing character is mocked for not being able to win, or has expensive medical bills, or has a scholarship or a promotion taken away from them because of their behaviour. There's a lot of steps between 'no consequences for anything' and 'boom your character is dead'.",

What I mean is a lot of the people that I rped with, when they see an enemy they have no self care because they know what ever happens their character will never die if they choose so and that means they can enter on every fight every villain every bad guy and know they \"won't get hurt\".\n\nOf course good rps don't really have this problem, I have a few that know their characters limits and will, run away, maybe surrender. \n\nI do understand your point of view and you are right in some ways, and that's is why having a right to kill is very difficult.",

I played on an RP server where some people with stronger characters would hide how powerful they were until they began the roleplay, only to spend it just curbstomping the other player. (My only post on this sub). Were the \u201cno kill\u201d rule not in place they\u2019d have just killed newbies right away.\n\nHowever, I agree that no characters ever dying makes it so there\u2019s no stakes involved. \n\nLike, is it truly fun to introduce a new villain in a server if even the lowest power characters know they are safe? What I have seen work is having people agree for plot purposes to have a character killed. Gives others motivation to engage the new villain and shows how dangerous they are. However to do that you\u2019d need people mature enough to be able to let go of a character for the sake of a good plot or have characters who exist to show off how strong a new challenger might be (which might make them lame characters). \n\nI think too many people are a little too precious with their characters. I\u2019ve played with too many people where in a fight between supposed equals their character is completely unscathed. No cuts or bruises, no \u201cI blocked that but it hurt.\u201d No, their bishonen character isn\u2019t even breaking a sweat as they duke it out against someone as strong as they are.

Personally I think if the death of my character contributes to the overall story/narrative that\u2019s fine and as long as I can make a new character to continue playing in that world (mainly cause I hate leaving a story unfinished). However if that death just comes out of no where and has no consequence narratively I\u2019ll probably be upset about the random, seemingly pointless death.\n\nNow I also do understand why most people hate it since you are killing their self-insert and they probably spent a lot of time crafting that character. For some it\u2019s hard making a new character and might suck the fun out of it. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is, make the death \u201cearned\u201d and make sure it has substance and proper reasoning. If my character might die early on in the story throw in a lifeline cause that is not fun if all my plans for them are ruined (side note: if the campaign is purposely meant to be hard and it is made clear in the beginning it\u2019s fine to kill them earlier). I hope what I wrote makes sense as I am just writing what comes to mind. Anyway good luck all your future roleplays my fellow nerd!",
