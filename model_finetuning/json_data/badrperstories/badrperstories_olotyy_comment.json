Yeah, facing reasonable consequences to devious and evil actions is not the same as acting out due to powerlessness and trauma and it definitely doesn't sound like Aurora was traumatized so much as dealing with some sort of guilt or more than likely, pretending to have moral pity, for what she did. The killing her route was... Interesting, I don't think that's necessarily bad, but I don't know enough about the prince to say as much or what he would have told the child to make him want to hunt down the equivalent nurse maid that actually raised him as an infant so either there's missing context I need to understand, or those are some plots holey enough to advocate for the position of Pope Nonsensicus the First",

            "body": "I've got a few, actually. One of them I'll try to keep short and sweet. I very clearly wanted to do an action/adventure kingdom roleplay, and the one I have developed for several years is a fantasy kingdom. I made it abundantly clear that I didn't want it to be romance-based, and I wanted absolutely no sexual content involved. For context, they protect humans from supernatural and celestial forces that would either destroy or use them. They are relatively undetected in doing so. The king has a daughter, and I happened to bring her up in the planning stage, but she wasn't supposed to be the main focus of the story. My partner had a human kingdom, which had stirred my kingdom by meddling with their magic to try to draw power from supernatural forces. In short, some higher-ups from my kingdom went to investigate the issue and see how the humans were doing so. This next part lasted for several turns, but they were stopped by the king of the human kingdom. In short, he was lonely because his wife died and now he wants a new wife, so he demands the king of my kingdom gives up his daughter to \"\"\"mate\"\"\" with the king of the human kingdom, or else his royal sorcerers would summon an old demon to conquer other kingdoms. Keep in mind, the only time she was ever brought up was during the planning stages. My response was: \n\n\"As soon as those words left the old man's mouth, there was the distinct screaming of guards outside, followed by pounding on the door. The door burst open, and in the doorway stood a tall, dark figure, cloaked in a dark purple cloth and holding a war scythe in one hand. Before anyone could react, the figure rushed towards the so-called 'royalty' perched on the throne, threw him to the ground, and pinned him down with one foot. Just as swiftly, the being sliced his trousers open and neutered the man in front of his subjects. Admin can't fucking believe how disgusting your suggestion was, for an old wrinkly man to fuck someone with the mind of a 20-year-old. Get a life.\" \n\nI blocked them after that, but I would've loved to see their reaction. I have more stories of rather interesting rp partners, but this one was the most relevant lol",
