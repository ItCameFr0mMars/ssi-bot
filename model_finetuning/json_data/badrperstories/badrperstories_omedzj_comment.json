There are a lot of people who go into RP that tend to have a very all-or-nothing mentality about things and they genuinely never consider that there's a middle ground.\n\nHowever, context is so important.  Someone who says they're quitting forever because they initially took on too many rps at once and burned out might benefit form being told it's ok to take a break.  A person who says they're quitting forever because roleplay isn't enjoyable in general or is super bad for their mental wellbeing is a totally different story.",

Making them feel guilty about it is the worst possible action in my opinion.\n\nHowever, I can understand that some people try to give such advice on subreddits like this. For example, with a lot of posts about quitting here seem a bit like 'Is there really nobody out there who still roleplays (topic)/isn't a ghoster/doesn't do smut?/a group roleplay that isn't cliquey', and of course that will make people think 'I am not like that, I can prove it to this person and maybe that will cheer them up', 'I am having the same problem, we seem to be such a good match, let's contact them and see where it goes' or 'my group roleplay is really friendly, let's see if they want to join'. I don't think that this works most of time, because a lot of the time, people realize that they lost their spark in general and these new roleplays will also fade out. \n\nBut I think most people here know phases when they felt down and frustrated with roleplaying, and later, they found a really good partner or group and continued roleplaying. People think of this experience and think that it might be the same for the other person, especially if they list similiar reasons for feeling down that they did, and so they try to 'solve' the issue. People who quitted roleplaying for good think about the benefits it had for them, or the negative effects some of this contact offers had for them, and see it in a very negative light.\n\nI agree that this can be rather annoying and even feel pressuring, and therefore, I wouldn't contact people with such offers. With some people, especially if they contact people with roleplays that obviously does not really fit their preferences or with offers that ignore everything the person has said about the reasons their leave (for example, if group roleplays in general are very stressful for them because they can't stand interacting with that many people, and they still send an offer for a group roleplay), it can even feel a little bit as if they want to contact that person because they seem vulnerable...yikes.",
