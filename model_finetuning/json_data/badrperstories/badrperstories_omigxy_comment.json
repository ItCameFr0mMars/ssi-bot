That is, is it better to just stay silent and let them wonder, or is it better to offer up some sort of explanation -- even as simple as 'Hey, sorry, I'm struggling with motivation and burnout right now, but I didn't want to leave you hanging.' I think most folks would probably be pretty understanding, and if they're not, well, then I'd say you dodged a bullet and they're not the ideal partner for you anyway.\n\nSometimes we are our own worst enemies, but I can almost guarantee that none of their responses are going to be as bad as whatever's in your head that you *think* they might say. Or maybe they won't say anything and you're right back where you started. But at least you'll have tried.",

That said, I value my (and my partner's) mental health above our RP. But you should communicate when you're having a bad day or week. It's about respect and responsibility. Even just a quick \"Going through a tough time, will try to get to this when I can!\" is enough for me. We all get in our heads but we can't just brush off partners because our silence could be giving them anxiety too, which isn't fair. It's better to be honest or upfront but if it's a frequent issue, it might be better to find slow paced partners. For me, I need an active OOC to keep things moving even if IC is slow (posts once a week for example).",

It's a double edged blade of sorts, because there's the struggle in wanting to communicate with them, but having yourself think the worst as time goes on without you. And the longer it goes on the worst you feel. Sometimes I open old roleplays and feel a sense of guilt because of it. \n\nAn understanding partner or one that doesn't mind a slower pace than most is someone I really appreciate in a roleplay. As of now I only really have one partner that I'm continuing with, I'm grateful that they checked up on me and don't mind my incredibly slow pace or constant apologies. Most I've been with have been understanding which is something I'm grateful for, these recent years have been very unkind to many so it makes an impact to a person's motivation to roleplay. Which is why even though I find myself with a lot of ideas, I don't think I'm able to use them because of how much I struggle with this. I hope that you're able to get through this though, it is a dreadful feeling. Taking time for yourself to recharge is important though and many will understand that or even relate with your struggles.",

            "body": "I\u2019m someone who is experiencing life on the other side of this and currently going though this. I love this man. Unconditional Love! I worry if he is even still alive. What you are going through shouldn\u2019t be discounted either. Its absolutely self-sabotage not just for you but for the other person too. They may also be self-sabotaging from anxiety (I know this because I started cutting/picking). If they love you, they are probably scouring every place possible to find out if you are at least safe and alive. I know I went to the ER because my nerves have been so shot that I wanted to end my own life. It\u2019s like having to mourn someone that you don\u2019t know is dead or alive. While at the same time having thoughts if they are going behind your back and feeling guilty about it because they could really be needing help. I know in my case, all I want is to hear from them. It\u2019s been a week of the most hellacious mind fuck a person can go through. You need to reach out to them and at least let them know you are alive. If they are still with you after this happening more than a couple times\u2026..they genuinely love you. I\u2019ve been with this person for two years and block people for judging him. Don\u2019t punish yourself because you are also punishing those who love you. I wish the best for you and hope it all works out.",
