            "body": "I can't speak to literal-god characters, but I know in my server we have a system where your dice can get elevated through events, where you earn points and then put them into stats. I've had newer people come into my server and tell me they think my main character, as the owner, is OP and I've tilted the game. *But* the fact is my server's been active for over 3 years and we do these events fairly often. Even when I actively skip every few events to keep my character from becoming OP, 3+ years is a lot of events and those points need to go somewhere. There's other players in the server who have similarly been in it for as many years and have the same level of dice as my characters do. No one ever calls them out.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are certain character classes that we don't fully allow to just be made, but we'll post a concept for them up and if a player shows us they can be trusted with that type of class, we let them adopt it. It just ends up being that these players, because they've gained staff trust, often end up being elevated to the staff after they've gotten these characters. Then new people come in and they don't know what's happened, they're not going to read through 3+ years of scenes to figure out how everything shook out. They just see the three most powerful characters' muns are on the staff team. And without asking why that is, they make assumptions.   \n\n\nShort of stopping writing altogether and only acting as a GM without a character, which isn't fun for me, I don't know how to fix the first issue. As for the second, I have tried putting my friends in the staff team and it turns toxic, so now I exclusively promote players, most of whom I only know through their writing, after they've shown a respect and appreciation for the world built. And once they're on the staff team, we actively cap what they can earn so it *doesn't* get so tilted in their favour. But it's also not fair of me to ask them not to write in a story they obviously love just because people want to make assumptions. So it's kind of a rock and a hard place.",
