That said, it's a reality of Discord RP that many people will pop in and head right back out.\n\nMake sure you have an attention grabbing advertisement. Discord servers are dime a dozen, so you want to stand out in some way. Especially if the fandom is a popular one!\n\nOnce people do join, things need to move rather quickly to hold their interest. Make sure you're not letting the OOC areas die while waiting for characters to be picked up. Have game nights, VC discussions, questions of the day, etc. if possible.",

            "body": "I know you listed this as a vent and not looking for advice, but I'm going to give you some advice as someone who runs a public RP server that's been active and thriving for almost 4 years now.   \n\n\nThe first thing to consider is the timing. It's mid-July, you are smack in the centre of something called the Summer Slump. Logically, you'd think that the summer time means people have more time for RP. What happens is that without as strict of a schedule, people's muses grow lethargic and they write less. It's not an absolute, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. This isn't something you did.   \n\n\nThe second thing is that starting a server is a lot like opening a restaurant. People romanticize running their own thing a lot without any idea of the commitment it actually takes. In the last nearly 4 years of my server, I've learned that activity is on me when it dips. If I can't be actively engaged, I can't ask anyone else to be. With the exception of some extreme circumstances where I've needed to take a small break, I've been online putting time into it every single day, sometimes all day, even when I'm at work or out doing other things. It's a lot. Even with an amazing staff team, it's a lot. That's not at all to say it can't be done, just prepare to WORK.   \n\n\nThird, be patient. In the same way that 1/5 restaurant will shut down within 3 years, a lot of servers will shut down in 3 months. Say you have 10 servers launching today: half will fizzle out in a month. Two more will be dead in three. The last two will hit a bump at six months, where they'll decide if they want to keep at it. And every single one of these servers will probably tell you it was the lack of activity, but I'd bet money that if you looked into them, most of them had a staff member who sat and waited for activity instead of constantly initiating. You need more than that first spark. You need to constantly fan the flames. Any time I see a server that's dying, the first thing I do is look to see how active the staff is.   \n\n\nAll of this means that your success or your failure is going to depend on what you put into it. It's going to be hard, but if you're passionate, you can absolutely do this. It won't get easier over time, but you'll get used to how busy it makes you and you won't really notice.   \n\n\nI will say though that Disboard is not a place I'd recommend advertising on. You'll get some good players from it, but most of the demographic aren't going to be the writers you want with the patience you need to get it rolling.   \n\n\nLastly, set your expectation for what Success and Failure look like to you and make that your mission statement. If to you, Success is 100+ people who sometimes post and you have that popularity, I'd say you've already failed. If, however, Success to you is people enjoying your story, coming out of their shell, and writing something beautiful with you - even if it's just one person - then you'll succeed. Servers for RP Groups cannot be a numbers game. These are people, artists usually, and they want you to lead them. So do that. Do your best at that. And you'll be fine.",

I'm not a fandom RP player, but it seems ill-advised to wait for roles that may never be filled (and if your RP is dying, *will* never be filled). Figure out how to make do without them in the mean time, and people may be more inclined to participate. People are here to RP, it doesn't seem that surprising to me that interest is dying off in an RP that is in a holding pattern and no one knows how long it will take before you move forward.\n\nWhat does needing all these roles filled mean if someone playing a role has to drop out? Does the RP come to a screeching halt? I'm sure you'd figure out a way to keep things going until the role gets filled again, so you ought to treat this the same.",

It's just simply impossible to start the RP with only one character, especially one that won't really affect the plot at all. We have had people drop out of important roles before in other servers, though when that happened we just had someone temporarily use that character... though the only reason that worked is because we already had a lot of the other characters claimed beforehand and we had someone willing to temporarily use that character.",

So, get them in a story. \n\nMaybe the main plot kicks off later when you've filled out more roles, maybe the canon characters become NPCs. Etc. But don't just sit around twiddling your thumbs and hoping your current player base won't abandon a server that was DoA.\n\nA server that relies on the random whims of people to fill out a roster of canon roles is doomed not to last, because you're reliant on factors outside of your control, and have no Plan B. \n\nAt this point I'd poll your current players: do they want to wait for the canon roles to fill, or do you want to start working with the players you've got? Who knows, by letting these OCs carve out their own stories, you may generate something wonderful and unique.",

            "body": "&gt; Well, the thing about that is that the server is entirely fandom-based. Although OCs are allowed, the main plot revolves around the canon characters. At this point in time, only one canon character has actually been claimed, excluding the ones I've claimed. It's just simply impossible to start the RP with only one character,\n\nWell see, there's your problem. Even a fandom rp can very much be about OCs. In fact, if you have only the canon characters as the main characters, and relegate OCs to the sidelines, the people who play those OCs are going to feel left out and leave. You've already encountered the issue of OCs just not getting picked up. If you want to write a specific story about specific characters, write fanfics. RP is collaborative, and subject to the whims of many writers. You can't really plan for everything to go perfectly. \n\nPeople come to rps to, well, rp. If they don't get any, they're just going to get bored and wander off and you'll be left with nothing. As they say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.",
