            "body": "I think you should be direct and honest with Alex about your interest. Appeasing her isn't fair to either of you. It might hurt her feelings, but it's worse to prolong it. Chances are, she already knows that you aren't as into it as she is. That's okay. Stringing her along isn't. \n\nI've been in this situation and trust me, it's so much better if someone tells the truth from the start. Maybe there's something different you and Alex could try. That is what I would suggest first. Give her advice or suggest a more interesting plot/character to see if that sparks her interest. Pin down what it is about her writing/characterization that's stifling the excitement. There has to be something. Are her characters too passive? Too predictable? I've sometimes gotten frustrated with partners when all of their characters take the submissive role and it's up to mine to drive the plot forward. It might be more helpful if you could give her advice and try and improve things before cutting it off. She would probably appreciate that more than just ending things without giving her a chance to improve.",
