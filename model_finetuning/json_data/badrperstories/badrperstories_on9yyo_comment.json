You don't have to sever contact with them, but you should reach out for other writers. Make new connections. I know it's hard to imagine finding new people who interest you just as much as they did, but there are so many writers out there who are potential partners for you. Cutting yourself off from an endless supply of talented, interested people isn't the answer.\n\nYou can't change how they are or control how/when they respond. The only thing you can do is make changes to your own behavior. Put your valuable attention elsewhere - because yes, it is valuable, and there are so many reasons why people drift that have nothing to do with you. There are people out there who would cherish your time and attention. It's hard to find a stable rp partner who matches you exactly, but you aren't going to find them unless you look for them. \n\nDefinitely do not continue this pattern. It's making you unhealthy, sad, and taking away all the joy you get from writing in the first place.",
