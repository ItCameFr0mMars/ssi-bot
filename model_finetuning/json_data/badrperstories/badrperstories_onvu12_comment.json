You're right, finding partners is difficult and frustrating.\n\nIt's not clear if you wanted advice or are just venting. In case you don't mind some advice, I'll say that what helped me cope is that ultimately, all that writing was for *me*, not anyone else. All those 1000+ hours of shit? It has improved my craft. It helped become better at plotting and expressing myself.  It has let me vicariously experience things I've never done myself.\n\nIf you go into a RP expecting to find a \"perfect\" partner, 99 times out of 100 you'll end up disappointed. But, unperfect partners are ok too. They still help, contributing some inspiration here, some enthusiasm there, for a time. And when that time ends, think more of their contributions to your growth as a writer and a person, and less of their shortcomings.\n\nHope you find a good balance OP. It's great that you still find joy in writing.",

Fuck the RPs, as long as you have your own characters and story building and all that good stuff, that\u2019s all you need. If you\u2019re only a writer, then write fan fiction of your own OCs. If you\u2019re an artist too, draw them. If not, commission stuff, if you can afford it. Create content for yourself. Maybe even just chat with your friends about your OCs; they don\u2019t have to be into RP at all, just a person who is willing to hear you ramble about your characters! That\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s far too exhausting to have to find a partner who won\u2019t ghost AND is a quality roleplayer nowadays\u2026 please take a break if all this is doing for you is stressing you out.
