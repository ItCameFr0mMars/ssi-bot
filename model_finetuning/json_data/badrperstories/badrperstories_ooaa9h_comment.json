That kind of thing is high school bullshit. It shouldn't be tolerated. \n\nAnd yes, mods are human, they're not going to see everything. This is basically how I ran my discord group servers and my forums before that. \n\nAdults should behave like adults or go elsewhere. \n\nI also agree on the triggers thing. There's a big difference between something you don't like and something that is just oughtright triggering (which can cause flashbacks, intense emotions, etc other than a small fear as in with most people with arachnophobia). I think it's great that they're disuading people that feel strongly about darker themes in rp to not join or people that have specific triggers like that, because it's not going to be a place that's fun for them. And while some of those darker themes are just oughtright taboo, they're trying to foster a place where these things can be explored safely, without judgement, and with full consent.\n\nSo, honestly, I see no problem with any of this.",

I took that to mean that they don't get to get away with anything extra. I've run servers too and my favored way to admin a server is to act as a normal member until some tidying up/mod work is needed. I've always found servers that 'elevate' their mod team to be problematic and end up with people on power trips. I'm a bigger fan of 'admins/mods as janitors and event organizers more than elevated personages.'\n\nOf course if they repeatedly act up and break the rules they shouldn't have the mod spot and should receive the same consequences as any other member.\n\n&gt;\u201cMembers need to know that problems might not be dealt with in the way the member may want.\u201d - No shit but when someone comes to a mod to tell them something is racist, offensive, or otherwise do not act like it\u2019s such an inconvenience and that maybe they need a thicker skin as it is just roleplay.\n\nThis one I would need to see examples of, honestly, because this can go either way. When I was running a server I had people coming to me sometimes with the *pettiest* of things that they felt were Dire (\"So and so didn't say hello to me in the OOC chat, that means they hate people with disabilities\" etc), and other times they would come to me with an issue that I would resolve in a way that they didn't foresee/want, but that doesn't mean it was wrong. \n\nI remember a few times someone would come to me saying something was offensive, but actually they were just a bit sensitive on that topic but whatever was said was fine. I don't say that to dismiss actual toxic shit, but sometimes people don't see the situation clearly and they have worked themselves up and any response other than the one they have pictured as being the ideal is seen as a failure.\n\nIf the mods are letting OOC bigotry slide though that's obviously terrible and unacceptable and something else entirely. You should leave the server if that is going on.\n\n&gt;\u201cMuses may also have negative attitudes and relate misogynistic, biased, or bigoted behaviour\u201d - Yes they may but it can be done in a way that does not make people uncomfortable OOC.\n\nThis one it would depend on the type of server and the extent things are done. Some people don't want to see *any* of that in their roleplay and that is absolutely valid, but it's okay if there are servers where IC bad behavior or darker themes are allowed. I think if servers that allow dark themes/bad behavior IC make you uncomfortable, you should definitely not be in that server and there's no shame in knowing that a space is not the one for you.",

            "body": "For the first point about mods. They had a mod post stuff multiple times that someone blacklisted. They are just trying to cover their ass for that. I think breaking server rules is not something a mod should be doing. A mod making a mistake fine but when it\u2019s violating a rule that\u2019s a bigger issue to me. \n\nYes there will always be someone with a petty issue and sorting through that is never fun because people will get pissy from time to time. I run a server. The issue is I know how they handle legitimate issues and they try to invalidate the person making a complaint. They made a former member feel like they had to explain their trauma for their trigger to be taken seriously because someone had crossed their blacklist item twice.\n\nI often write darker subjects. It is allowed in my server but there has to be some accountability for how it may affect people ooc. They had a muse say something racist and a mun brought it to the mods. The mun got told that the mod team didn\u2019t see it as racist. They asked if anyone on the mod team was POC and got told it was offensive for them to ask that. This mod team is almost all cis white women with one white trans guy. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they didn\u2019t act like a POC shouldn\u2019t be offended by something racist because it was in character. \n\nOver all if I saw this in another server I might squint and go okay then but give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately I know the server this is from and it is not a good place to rp. The mods change the rules any time they want to be allowed to do something or want to stop a member from doing something. They literally policed a way a canon character was being written then got mad when someone pointed out one of them was writing a canon character inaccurately, something one of the mods does constantly as she picks up muses from fandoms she is not in and does no actual research on them.",
