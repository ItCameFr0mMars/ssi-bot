It's often hard to stomach your own reading or works because you as the writer know how to find the flaws better than most. But it's also because of that it'll help you become a better writer.\n\nI used to try this sort of exercise back when I wrote fan fiction: write a short fic of anything for yourself. Sleep on it then read it carefully. Edit where you see mistakes or needs for improvement. Then if you're comfortable with it, ask someone you trust to give you feedback. Save the original and the edited version. It's good to have some form of proof that you as a writer are improving and this can help you desensitize yourself to that feeling of \"Crap, I wrote this?\".",
