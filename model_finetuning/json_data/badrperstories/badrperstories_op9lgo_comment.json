Or, if it would help you, we could focus on fewer characters in our story and revisit the rest when you have more time.\"\n\nIt sounds like this good RP partner is also a good friend, but since they won't tell you what's up exactly, I think this is the best way to be supportive. It does suck, and it's always possible they've lost RP motivation for whatever reason. Depending on how they respond to the options above, it might segue into a dialogue about whether the slowness is due to IRL issues (like they said) or a lack of interest for whatever reason.\n\nI hope they're able to return to RPing with you soon!",

I say just give them a break for a while, feel free to ask if they are doing okay as well if you genuinely mean it.",

The point is\u2026have a conversation FIRST, rather than assume you know what\u2019s going on, then assign value to your own time.
