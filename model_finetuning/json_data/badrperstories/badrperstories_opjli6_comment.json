This guy was adamant on making his character have a Wendigo form, which for one didn't make sense for the character, two was the pop culture DEER SKULL DEMON THING, and three he was some random ass white guy with no ties at all to Great Lake where the folkloric creature originates. It's tiring to see how bad NA ideas are butchered and twisted by somebody just adding it to their character to seem cool. This is why I'm happy my people's mythos aren't known because this would drive me wild.",

You get attached to certain features and getting rid of it is hard, but as you said, when it's such an important change, you almost just need to suck it up.\n\nIf the names genuienly have a meaning or alot of importance, I think they should've either studied so beforehand so this wouldn't have happened, or just..accept that it's wrong. Some cultures have really important aspects of it, and making an oc where you flat out ignore that can easily turn offensive or feel \"off\".",
