Chatting about someone\u2019s dog, or harmless topics, is friendly without being any kind of big commitment or in depth look at you or anyone else.

It helps boost morale and sustain the RP.\n\nThat being said, I spend most of my time in an RP scene where people regularly meet each other IRL for fun and get in romantic relationships with each other.
