Now, before you click the downvote button, I only do it to people who deserve it. \n\nA 'justified' bully who purposefully toes the line in seeking out people that are bad enough to 'deserve it' is still a bully.  You're doing that to seek approval for it and to avoid getting told off for bullying.  Make your beware post if need be, don't raid shit.  There's a reason callout posts go 'do not harass the person involved', it's to keep their hands clean of nonsense and to avoid chucking gasoline on a fire, because most people will just see the lunatic smugly throwing gasoline and tune out.  It hurts your case and can redflag for 'this person is talking a load of shit to try and get others to join in'.\n\nI'm old enough to remember the thick of the CWC nonsense and how ultimately it was never about \"they're a creepy person\" or \"you're just weenies for wanting to help\" when people should have just *walked.  Away*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;8. Literal Child making an ERP server: FBI plant.\n\nFile a report to discord with relevant server and message IDs instead of hurrdurrtrolling so they can actually shut the thing down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;7. \"You're an admin now, make server work, pls\": An easy way to get trolled.\n\nOkay so maybe they're a daft kid and it's babby's first server, chuck 'em a guide.  You don't owe them the emotional labour, that doesn't mean you need to get involved or punish them for spamming 'help pls'.  Walk away.",

Is there any reason why she should have trusted you over 'that guy', was he ever rude to her or the other players? Did he have a certain kind of reputation?\n\nIn all honesty OP isn't trustworthy themselves and probably gave off vibes that they're the kind of person who would 'mess with' a server when they don't get their way or think because their target 'deserves' it anything goes.\n\nI've seen edgyboy types go \"I knew x was a creep and no one listened!!\" and it was because they had their own open, obvious behavioural issues.\n\nI feel like part of getting older is the awareness that friendships end and how a person treats their enemies or ugly splits can just as easily happen to you - most will bitch but ultimately part ways and leave you alone, and that's fine.  When people chase and hound their targets or pull weird up-ending revenge stunts on an entire server that spill over to affect everybody I pull away because \"Yeah, you've got issues and someday the person on the receiving end could be me\".",

            "body": "Reminds me of a thing that happened in one of my group roleplays. Someone informed me that they had trouble with another member, a guy that was known to be a little rude and with whom I had a not very nice encounter before. The person who informed me had a weird vibe as well, fake friendly and always praising me but sometimes passive aggressive and seemed easily angered. I confronted the person he had an issue with, and this person basically told me that they would not change anything and they have the right to invent backstories for the other players characters...yikes. After a lot of arguing, they got removed, the person who informed us was happy. But the person who got removed warned us that the other player was a terrible person and so on. Turns out they were right, the other player was an absolute nightmare to deal with later on.\nBut in the end, there was no way I could have known that and no way that I would just side with a person just because of a little weird gut feeling, and I was still glad that the other problem player was removed even though it turned out that the other writer was also 'that guy'.\n\nAnd your last paragraph is spot on. If people talk about others like they are their 'enemies', are openly hostile when it comes to their previous partners, or talk about haven taken revenge on someone who 'deserved it' , that is basically the biggest red flag I can think of.",
