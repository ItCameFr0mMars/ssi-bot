What *I* think happens most of the time can be broken down into categories:\n\nA)The initial enthusiasm fades as they wait for bites to their post, and that in turn, makes them hesitant to reply.\nB)They don't really want to RP, but show off their skills in putting posts together/worldbuilding/OC creation.\nC)RL issues keep them away for extended periods at a time, and that can lead to burnout (see A). \nD)They aren't sure how to turn someone down after they have been contacted. I have been in this spot, and the best way is to politely decline, as most users I have spoken to (on and offsite) are chill and won't go from 0 to 100 unless they're **incredibly** shitty people.\nE)They forget about even being messaged in the first place/receiving a notification and go on with their business without realizing.\n\nIn all seriousness however, I wish more of these users would realize that being ignored (as that is what it boils down to when you see them bumping their ads) hurts even more than a \"No thank you, I feel like we may not be like a good match.\" which gives closure at least.",

It could also be possible that you missed something that was implied about their search and you did not notice, so that they thought 'Meh, if maruruu can't even get that right, it is obvious that they have not really read my search, I won't waste my time on this.' Or that your replies are not up to their standards, and they want someone with better grammar/more descriptive (this is really just speculation because again, we don't know what exactly you write in these replies).

The reason? Because I've been called every name you can think of when denying potential partners: I'm a picky bitch, a snob, the RP police, too good for them (this was sarcastic), and anything else you can think of. I'm sorry to anyone whom I've ghosted after asking me if I wanna RP, but I don't know who you are and I genuinely don't know how you'll react if I turn you down. \n\nI'm not the only person in the world who RPs. If my preferences are super picky, then the only person I'm hurting is myself. I don't need someone to tell me I'm picky - I fucking know I am.",

I agree someone who doesn't put the slightest amount of effort in it doesn't deserve the reply, but if someone did put together a PM and doesn't just come in by trying to push their own ideas even a copy &amp; pasted \"No thanks, I believe we are not a good match due to x\" works (at least, that's what most of my partners have admitted to doing).
