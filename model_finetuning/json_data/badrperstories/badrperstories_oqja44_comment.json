            "body": "After someone broke it off with you (for whatever reason), it is best to not be the first to contact them again. Often, the reason people tell you why they want to stop are not (fully) honest. If they don't contact you for another roleplay, it is safe to say that they did not want to write it with you/or at least did not think about you as a possible roleplaying partner. \n\nI guess that they felt pressured because turning you down after they were 'back into roleplaying' would make question their motive for leaving the first time, so they thought that they would give the roleplay another chance. But it turned out that they still did not feel comfortable, which is quite unfortunate. Sometimes people are just not a good match, and I suspect that if you had a largely positive encounter with them (in a way that you did not even notice something was wrong and you thought everything was going great until they blocked you) but they think that you don't go together well at all, there might have been some hints that you did not recognize or some differences in preferences and writing style that were obvious to them but you did not notice. By no means I want to say that this was your fault, but it seems obvious that your perception of how well you match was quite different. \n\nSaying to someone 'Hey, I am not comfortable with you.' will sometimes lead to them saying that you accuse them of being a predator or being a creep, and that will offend many people. I get that you would prefer them to be upfront. But especially with people who obviously fear confrontation (and blocking is an obvious sign of that), it is very uncommon that they will tell you their true reasons upfront. I am honestly surprised that they did when they decided to break things off for the second time.",
