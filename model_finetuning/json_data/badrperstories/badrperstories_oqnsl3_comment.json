They should thank you for even trying.\n\nAnd then, they have the nerve to make it seem like you are somehow a coward for not going through with it? \n\nThis like the people who basically shoehorn others into a very specific plot that is against their preferences, and if their partner is nice enough to try it they complain endlessly that they are not good enough and should do more research, knowing fully well that the subject is not something their partner is experienced with. And if the other person rightfully gets fed up with that, they throw another fit. \n\nDefinitely a good riddance.",

People like that are exactly the reason many other people are uncomfortable writing canon characters, they have certain fantasy in their head and if people can't live up to their expectations, they get rude.\n\nAs long as you did not write something super wrong, I always find it a bit icky if people critique it too much. Like, if their image and your image of the character are too far apart, it should be them who realizes 'Whelp, we seem to have very different interpretation of that character, we might not be a match'. Asking you to change some little things is fine in my opinion, but it sounds like nothing was good enough for them. Especially with the whole 'describe her body in detail' message...asking you to describe that so much sounds like those terrible books where all the female characters get an extra paragraph about the exact size of their breasts and nipples.",

Now after I've read a couple of her POV chapters and re-watched her first scene, I see that I was actually pretty accurate. This guy wanted to start with the very first scene where the characters I'm playing would be passive (Dany canonically being extremely subdued in both the show and book version) to narrowly avoid Viserys' wrath, stretched it out much longer than needed, and then complained about the passivity. It didn't help that while the quality of his writing was good, his roleplaying style mirrored how he spoke to me OOC. Just absolutely bombarding me with text. That paired with how overbearing the character was contributed to him dominating the scene.   \n\n\nAnd I also don't think he's aware of the psychology of an abuse victim after kind of implying my character was nearly a Mary Sue for enduring it. The whole \"no breaking point\" thing was also another odd complaint considering it was established that the roles were going to be reversed early in our planning (it was going to happen while they were with the Dothraki, where he'd have been less of a threatening figure).   \n\n\n(Oof, sorry to be coming back to this once again, but the more I think about it, the more shit I'm realizing. Also, I've stopped referring to the person as they/them because I'm about 90% they're male)",
