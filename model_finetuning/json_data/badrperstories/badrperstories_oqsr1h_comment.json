It was a Mecha RP where the plot would have revolved around two up-and-coming pilots that were soon to be drafted in their nation's army to curb a civil war.\n\nWell, turns out my partner only planned on sticking to a single OC instead of splitting the creative effort by taking the helm of NPCs, as well as romancing every single girl despite there being multiple pairings. The dramatic war story we were supposed to write was turned into a low-quality soap opera where every single lady would have swooned over his OC. \n\nNever got someone else to do an RP like that ever again, but honestly? I was happy to get out of it.",

Usually it's something the other person will bring up in plotting, and they'll ghost when I tell them that I'm not interested in xyz and won't do it. Every so often, we move forward without it happening again, but I've noticed that those roleplays never last long. I imagine they tried to convince themselves that they were still interested but weren't able to keep it up. It's always been a baffling thing to me, because surely it would be easier and faster to put up their own ad or just message people whose interests lie in that direction in the first place?\n\nI had a particularly baffling encounter recently where my partner helped me worldbuild a low fantasy medieval setting and then... their first post had their character texting someone on a cell phone. I reached out to them asking why a phone existed in a medieval setting and they never replied, in or out of character. We spent several days of rapidfire messages plotting out a framework of castles and knights and dragons and all that typical stuff, referencing specific real life historical periods, so I'd assumed we were on the same page.
