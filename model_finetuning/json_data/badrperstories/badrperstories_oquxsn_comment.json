Also made clear in the story that MaSB lived in a modern time as he went to high school and college. Making a timeline through many years is difficult. And it's also difficult to justify why a +500-year-old SB would be willing to join a union cause of centuries of tension between humans and SB. That's the point I was trying to make. Why would he decide to do it steaming from *one* person out of all the years he lived in his life now? What made him not do it centuries back? Also, his family is sorta well known in the human world so it would raise suspicious that they were SBs. So I would have to change almost everything. \n\nEven all of this doesn't change the fact of how I feel about it.",
