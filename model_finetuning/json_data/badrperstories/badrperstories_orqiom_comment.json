But it's still a bit galling being painted with the same brush as those who truly deserve to be blocked, for exhibiting stalkery, aggressive behavior. Heck, my day job involves helping survivors recover from abuse at the hands of horrible, horrible people, so maybe that's also why I'm sensitive to being lumped in with them. But I also get why it's a tool of defense, and really, at the end of the day, no one *really* needs to justify why they do what they do, if it makes them feel safer. \n\nAlso, maybe it's not just the roleplay community. Online communities in general can be pretty vicious, what with the unprecedented personal attacks, doxxing and whatnot. You never know who's lurking on the other side of the screen, after all.",

            "body": "I think most people don't completely loose their shit when you tell them that you aren't a match. But even if they don't harass you or get stalkery, people who would rather avoid confrontation aren't a fan of 'Couldn't you have thought about this sooner, thanks for nothing.'  or pressuring 'Please, can we make it work, I would do anything' messages either, and they are much more common. And it much harder to see the signs if someone will do that  later in conversations. Basically, it happens quite often that they work up the courage to leave, just to be hit with multiple reasons why they have to stay. Especially stuff like 'trying to make it work' or 'try to compromise' can make people feel extremely guilty and pressured to continue if they try to end (or not start) a roleplay, but is something that many other people might see as good roleplaying behavior. \n\nYes, it is definitely a little rude. But basically, after sharing their reasons and saying that they will leave, I think they see the conversation as 'over' and as something where nothing good can come from anymore. At best, people will reply with polite 'Good luck with your search'. At worst, they start to insult them. And I think most of the replies they get are somewhat in the middle of that. So if this happens to you, you shouldn't think that they are lumping you in with the worst of the worst (stalkers, predators, people who actively harass others). They are just more sensitive and have another 'use' for ghosting than you do (to avoid any interaction that could become even a little unpleasant).",

My own requirements for blocking are way more dire, but clearly, not everyone thinks of it the same way I do! That was partly the impetus for this post, just to see if blocking is way more universal than I ever realized. Sounds like it is. I'm a lot less butthurt by it now. ;)",

You are not teaching them anything by coming to their inbox and telling them 'Hey, you asshole, that you ghosted me was shitty as hell.'\n1.) they know that it is not good behavior, there are multiple threads in this subreddit alone about how shitty it is. Everyone already knows that it is impolite and considered bad roleplaying behavior. \n2.) you writing a rude message confronting them is not actually that much of a negative consequence. They can just block you again or simply ignore you (like they already do). In the end, nothing happens, you are not stopping them in any way, or teaching them any thing except 'Damn, I wish I had blocked this person on reddit as well'.\n3.) Hate to say it like that, but ghosting is allowed whenever they feel like it. You have no real power to forbid them to do that, it is a hobby and nobody owes you anything. Yes, you can be angry, you can warn people about them so that they don't write with them in the future, maybe if it your own group server you can block them, you can confront them if you want to waste your time...and that is it. It is still, at large, perfectly allowed to ghost people. You can only control your own behavior and how you deal with stuff like that, your influence about the behaviors of others is very limited.",

Like, I noticed that you even replied to at least one other comment of mine with a rant about ghosting, completely missing the point of the original comment.\nThe problem is precisely this: you can be the nicest person on the planet, and still get ghosted, and that is not your fault. But it will continue to happen, it is just a fact of roleplaying. No matter what you do, it can't be avoided. No matter how much you confront ghosters, they (most of the time) won't answer and already know that this behavior is shitty, they won't change their behavior, and nothing is gained. The only thing that happens is that you obsess even more about it, and it begins to frustrate you even more.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is: Realize that it is most likely not your fault you got ghosted, be happy when you find a partner that is not like that, and move on. If you concentrate too much on the bad thing that happened to you that you can't change (because like I said, you can only control your own behavior, you can't change the behavior of the ghosters), that is not healthy.",
