            "body": "So first off thank you for your answer ( as the updoot proclaimed ) but secondly I really do appreciate the elaboration. While I've toyed with the organized crime route in many settings, I've personally found a lot of people mostly interested in playing an innocent role versus the criminal one and not so much the criminal itself. It's one I find too which any sell that often has it as a plot revolves around a predetermined 'bad to good' outline with then falling for someone outside the life. \n\nMost of the time any desire to do competing criminals or a reverse ( good average Joe to bad Joe through the criminal influence) is met in my experience with only a bundle of chirping crickets.\n\nI certainly do though see the appeal of storylines and concepts revolving around an underground that operates on it's own system compared to the rest of society. It's a very scholarly interest I feel, a hook to undercover and discover the inner workings of something totally different from one's day to day that for all intents and purposes is not only foreign but taboo and dangerous.",

That generally goes with a power imbalance (I always enjoy something like king X knight). Other than this I really, really enjoy darker themes that are somehow woven into the roleplay.\nBefore my bestest partner ghosted me, I had a very cool mafia/crime themed roleplay and I honestly enjoyed that. When I was younger I was a sucker for WW2 and WW1 roleplay. So Generally anything that is somehow dramatic and leaves a lot of space for character development. I usually played Germans there who blindly followed Nazi ideology but due to them meeting the other character they somehow realized that none of that was something good (that happened after like 300 A4 pages).\n\nBut what I need to say \"yeah I'm going to write with you\" (or rather write your plot with you) is seriously a solid plot that doesn't just aim at romance and the lack of forcing me. Recently somebody PMed me about a WW2 roleplay and say they want me to play a very dominant and cruel SS-Officer (it might sound contrary to what I have written above but it's not because playing absolutely heartless assholes isn't my cup of tea) and all this because they wanted to have their sassy girl put into place (I swear if she had bothered the guy, he would have shot her on sight) and spark a romance between them (and I just wondered how, but okay)",

            "body": "It's definitely not a problem, as it's an interesting question!\n\nI know many people definitely have a hard time rping criminals due to the simple fact it's pretty hard to humanize them (without accidentally woobifying them or romanticizing their actions). It's also why I imagine the 'bad-to-good' plots are pretty popular, as it allows for the criminal to also become more palatable and human. \n\nI've otherwise have gotten a similar response when I've tried to propose things like that. I think at best the only thing I've gotten is bad boy/girl meets good boy/girl in a sort of high-school scenario [or the cops/criminals scenario]; but even then it still falls under the 'bad to good' dynamic a majority of the time. I just think it's due to the fact a lot of people have a hard time playing a 'bad' person in general. \n\nBut otherwise that's why I enjoy a lot of organized crime/underground scenarios, as it practically has it's own culture; it just depends on where you're at and what group is involved. I already enjoy learning about normal cultures (that aren't criminally based) and reading about organized crime groups is like learning about another type of culture for me.",

            "body": "I generally aim to create an actual story-line instead of just having a loose set of events happen, something that actually I was made aware of somewhat recently. (Like 5 months ago? Hail to you, great roleplaying partner.) It is important for me for stuff to actually like happen.  \n\n\nAs for the setting: urban fucking fantasy, though I mean the approach to it like in Final Fantasy or Fullmetal Alchemist rather than in Twilight or Harry Potter. I like mixing the common fantasy tropes (especially if said tropes are from anime/manga and jrpgs) with a more modern setting. i don't know why exactly, but I (perhaps unfortunately) have acquired a bias for the Medieval European Fantasy settings. There are still some tropes from the genre I utilize, but in general while I still can enjoy a game set in such setting (a bit less so when it comes to watching anime), I no longer enjoy writing pieces in these time periods. And anime tropes in general... though used in moderation, some of them translate to text awfully unfortunately.  \n\n\nAnd aside from drama, actual stakes and such I like the emphasis on action. I suppose the teenager within me is yet to die still.  \n\n\nRomance I enjoy, so do I enjoy NFSW scenes (so long they're used in moderation), but I dislike either to be the focus. Also it's good if the two characters don't have conflicting personalities and it's hard to make a pairing work out if our two characters hate each other's guts.",

While many of my plots usually have a pseudo-endgame, I had often relied on character dynamics and role-play rhythm which, yeah, often was a loose set of events. I'm hesitant when it comes to the formula in general since either I feel I'm railroading things too much or giving way too much liberty and not enough order to move things along.\n\nI figure though that's the point of communication though, yeah? But also I feel you on having certain biases, strict modern has always been difficult for me given that it feels too, predictable? As for urban fantasy, I honestly haven't considered that as much as I feel I've should. Typically though for me I think of Shadowrun on one extreme ( which is pretty cash money in my opinion ) or asd you said, Twilight. \n\nThe conflicting part is a good point as well, I think. I've always enjoyed conflict on personal levels with characters and I think emphasizing that too much might also be one of my issues. At the very least leaving more compatibility open would be a good step forward. Thank you for your reply!",

            "body": "The requester states what kind of plot or character they're looking for without having all the details set in stone. They have some description of the character they want, like an age range and gender, but aren't providing me with a history and personality to conform to. They name a setting, such as medieval fantasy, but don't have an intricate world prewritten. They also specify a character type they want to play, or say that they're open to play either role in their prompt. \n\nI also look for plots where my character has an active impact on the plot. It's no fun for me to basically play an NPC because my character will never be as important or strong or intelligent as my partner's. Or to be halfway through writing a starter before they mention that their character is an antisocial hermit who would attack my character on sight. It's not always easy to tell from the ad, but I can usually figure it out pretty early on in the plotting stage, at least. \n\nSometimes this means that there's a prompt with a specific role requested. \"I want to write a plot where my 25 y.o. prince runs away from home to avoid an arranged marriage and finds out that there's still magic in other kingdoms. I'm looking for someone to play for a knight in his thirties from one of the other kingdoms to be the prince's mentor and teach him how to use his own magic that he didn't know he had.\" \n\nThis tells me the character they're playing, the character they want me to play, how our characters meet, what kind of relationship they want between the characters, and the setting. It also establishes some worldbuilding. Some kingdoms have magic, some kingdoms think magic no longer exists, royals have arranged marriages, and magic has to be learned. That gives a framework of what the person wants to do while leaving plenty of room for me to come up with ideas for things like the culture of the knight's kingdom and the rules of magic. It also gives me control over my character beyond the fact that he's a knight in his thirties who has magic. \n\nSometimes it's more vague. \"Looking for enemies-to-lovers T4T bounty hunters in space, any pairing, willing to play either. Let's build a story full of action and danger!\" This tells me the characters they want, the desired dynamic between our characters, and that they're looking for an action-adventure plot in space. I don't know what kind of setting they have in mind beyond 'in space' but I can reasonably assume it's a futuristic sci-fi setting. I can create whatever personality and history I want, and help brainstorm why they're enemies, as well as details of the setting overall. It's not detailed, but it gives me a starting point. \n\nVery open ads are an automatic pass for me. \"I want to write a MxF apocalyptic plot\" doesn't tell me anything besides the desired pairing and a vague description of the setting. What ages do they want the characters to be? Which role are they playing? Zombie apocalypse? Alien invasion? Modern day? Future? Past, even? Often as not, these requests are from the kind of people who want me to come up with a character, plot, and setting while they answer all my questions with \"idk\" or \"sure\". \n\nAnd then there's the super-detailed requests. \"You play a shy, sensitive, compassionate twenty-nine-year-old who has two cats and a bird. She's the third of five daughters and has lived all her life in this small town in Texas. She works as a cashier at Walmart and shares a two-bedroom apartment with her friend Marina who's twenty-seven, works at McDonald's, and hates her.\" There's no room for me to create a character of my own. Her age, gender, personality, family structure, living situation, and job are all already decided for me. She's basically a canon for a fandom I don't know about.",

            "body": "I pretty much only do medieval or historical inspired fantasies, but it can be more modern if the world is different enough from our own.  I do tend to lean towards dark high fantasy, but not enough that anything else is a deal-breaker.\n\nMy ads don't really have much of a story to them.  They talk about the specific character I'd like to play.  I'll list a bit of their history, where they're at in life now, and what their overall hopes/goals are.  Sometimes it's vague like wanting to go out and see the world.  Sometimes it's a little more specific like a mage wanting to take on an apprentice.  Rarely, I'll have a few things I want to RP out before transitioning to something more ambiguous like a rogue spying on a royal, genuinely befriending them,  helping them flee when there's a revolution of some sort, but then leaving what they do next next open-ended.\n\nI might put in a variety of loose scenarios on how our characters could be introduced.  I'm very much a 'build the plot as it goes' roleplayer so the more intricate, long-term storylines usually come to light after the characters and world have had some development.\n\nAs for pairings, I usually just go with that I'm fine with or without romance involved, but I don't do smut at all.  When romance is involved, I make sure that it's just one of many elements to the story and not the main focus.\n\nWhen looking at someone else's ad, ooc compatibility is first and foremost.  There are obvious things like length, frequency, or nsfw requirements.  However, I also look for more subtle clues.  Does it feel like they're really just looking for a friend rather than an rp partner?  Do they come off as being pretentious to the point of exhaustion?  Are they actually into world-building or is that a lie?  Is this one story element they're keen on actually a fetish on which this whole story is built?\n\nIC, I look for the same flexibility I have in my own ads and I look for interesting, well-made characters.  I'm very much a character-focused roleplayer, so I'm less concerned about the plot itself and more concerned about how the plot would influence the characters.  It's cool that we're fighting bandits, but I'm more interested in how our characters feel about fighting bandits.  I look for ads that imply the other person has the same view.\n\nThough, to be honest, I almost never look at or answer other people's ads anymore since I have better luck with putting up my own.",

            "body": "I really enjoy darker, thriller/psychological terror horror-esque type stories. The darker, the better. Sometimes I throw supernatural themes in for the hell of it or others themes. A lot of my characters are morally gray or just really, really *fucked up*. Couple morally \u201cgood\u201d ones but they are few and far between (although I typically main one). I draw the line on most things ERP, but not with gore/murder or anything along those lines. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea and that\u2019s totally fine, but damn is it fucking hard to find good partners. Especially ones that don\u2019t turn it into a fetish/kink thing. \n\nThey are usually original stories that I create and usually I\u2019m the \u201cstoryteller\u201d but I definitely once in a blue moon do fandom-based or am just the participant in someone else\u2019s creation. I honestly tried doing happy Slice of Lives or happier themes but they can never keep me drawn in for long. Sure, some of my stories may initially incorporate these or seem to be happy or even pure lovey-dovey romance but BAM. Someone fucking dies (Miss Keisha\u2026?). I\u2019m all for suspense and red-herrings. Plot-twists or tying seemingly insignificant things into the plot line? Hell yeah.",
