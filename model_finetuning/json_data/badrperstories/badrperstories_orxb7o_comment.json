            "body": "So after writing paragraphs explaining how this person's behaviour is exhausting and negatively affects you, they have to be chased down for answers to simple questions, and they haven't changed in nearly a decade... you don't know if you should give them another chance? This is exhausting and annoying just to read about, I genuinely cannot imagine actually dealing with this person. They've had, and wasted, more chances than they deserve. It's time to set a boundary that you'll no longer roleplay with them. \n\nJust because you've roleplayed with someone for a long time doesn't mean that you have to keep writing with them. One person's bullshit destroyed your interest in *the entire hobby for seven months*. That's not normal, healthy, or sustainable. It's time you stop this cycle for your own good. Sure, they might have every intention of following through this time, but it's just not fair to you to go through this all over again. \n\nIf this person contributes nothing to your life besides a couple months of roleplay before they disappear for a year or longer, then what are you truly losing? It might be worth some self-reflection to examine why you're willing to let them keep treating you this way. Finding partners that you click with is hard, yeah, but this is bullshit that you shouldn't have to put up with. It's time to move on to better partners, and set boundaries that don't allow people to mistreat you like this in the future.",

I am fortunate enough to have a mutual understanding with my partner, and we're also very patient towards one another. On-and-off should not be at all like what you've described with your partner. It sounds like they're basically using you for their own entertainment and ditching you when they get bored.

The more rational side of me knows that the odds of them genuinely changing within the span of these last 7-8ish months are pretty low; especially since they happened to pull this behavior again around the same time someone I loved was actively DYING \\[and who ended up dying\\].

Like I'm just genuinely confused due to the simple fact I've had a way worse partner than them before I met them to name just one thing. I've originally thought of them as the best partner I've ever had and I was able to ignore their behavior for quite a while; under the justification 'at least they didn't do X to me like my old partner did'. Especially since my partner before them actually drove me to harm myself physically due to the stress they put me under. I've just learned to swallow the frustration for quite a while due to the fact they haven't drove me to harm myself like my previous partner before them.\n\nBut due to the circumstances of the last time they've ghosted me really cut me deeply this time; as someone I loved was actively dying/dead at the time. They knew someone I loved was dying/dead, but still made me end up chasing them down once again due to the fact they couldn't be bothered to tell me they were getting bored until I directly asked them. I've only started questioning things recently due to that, but admittedly I'm having trouble getting past the whole 'they didn't drive me to harm myself' justification. \n\nBut considering the comments I've gotten are basically giving me reassurance that my frustrations are valid \\[and that I should at least have a talk with them, if not outright dump them\\]; I'm probably going to try to have a talk with them here.",
