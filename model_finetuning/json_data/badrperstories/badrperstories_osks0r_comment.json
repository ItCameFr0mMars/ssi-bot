            "body": "ohhh, this message looks oddly familiar. I think the same person wrote to me a few days ago. \n\nAnyway, I'll probably get downvoted out of existence for this.  \nAbout this nazi stuff: yes. I used to do that a lot when I was younger. The thing was that I tried not to romanticize the things they did. It was suffering, armageddon and disaster everywhere when I wrote these roleplays, as my partner and I mostly went for action on the battlefield, rather than 'I want your terribly evil Nazi lad fall in love with my naive, sassy French girl who his bothering him all the time and this will cause change of heart'. If I were to play such a person, he would have killed that girl without thinking twice about it, just because he could.  \nAs somebody who enjoys historical roleplays, in my opinion it heavily depends on how you play it out. I once had somebody who wanted to play somebody from the resistance getting caught while revolting and make a romance out of it. Bruh, they would have been executed in the next possible moment. But I think it is okay (in the context of this being historically inspired fiction), if you enjoy and do it the most correct way possible: not romanticizing stuff, writing out the horros of warfare/occupation and similar things. I honestly don't really see a difference between writing out fiction like this and watching films like this. These things exist. In my country, the film Suite fran\u00e7aise is very popular for example and is not based off of a real event (at least not more than the war itself) but a novel somebody wrote, which is, again, not based on any specific event, than the war itself if I got that right.   \n\u00a0This, of course, does not and will never excuse anything any Nazi has ever done, you have to be extremely careful when writing such things. But when I was younger writing this stuff taught me a lot about the times, and also about the horrors people had to face back then. I dug deep and deep into German history and ww2 in general.",

There is no need to equate fiction with reality at every turn. Many of us enjoy varied subject matter that would never in a million years make it into how we live our real lives. It's part of what I enjoy about fiction, exploring action and emotion and what drives a character.\nYou didn't want to play, that's fine.\n\nThey are not a bad role player because they asked.\n\nEta: a word to complete a sentence.",

Not, Hey I read your ad and how do you feel about this instead. \\*shrug\\* So perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nHowever, I still don't consider a polite inquiry like this to be bad behaviour.

Even Nazi characters can be interesting because in real history - there were many who were pressured to join the Nazi party. They didn't do it because they believed in the cause. They did it because they didn't want to be targeted themselves.  With the Nazi Youth - they had no choice and all German children had to join.  \n\nThere was a book I read many years ago called, \"The Nazi Officer's Wife.\"  It is the true story of a Jewish woman who went into hiding and a Nazi man fell in love with her.  He eventually married her, even though she confessed that she was Jewish.  In the end, they had protected each other.  He protected her during the war and then her relationship with him protected him after the war.  \n\nI don't think then that writing rps about Nazis is wrong.  Of course if people don't like the subject, then they should not write about it.  But there is a lot of real history that is so interesting that it makes for compelling historical fiction.",

Both are an evil being that potentially turns good through the love of the innocent they want to corrupt, *or* an evil being corrupting the innocent that tries to love them. Essentially a power play dynamic.   \n\n\nIt's arguably the same trope that we see in 50Shades, in Twilight, in every YA with a Vampire/Demon/Werewolf, in Phantom of the Opera, in Star Wars Episode 3. We objectively know that Nazi = Bad. Big Bad. No question. But we apply a sense of hypothetical compassion to literal monsters in the fantasy we consume and it's arguably the same thing. The reason we know Nazis were bad is because what they did was an evil act. A demon or the devil himself even are evil incarnate. The difference is that we can confirm one existed, whereas depending on who you talk to, most of us will say the others don't.   \n\n\nBut I know I had to read Summer of My German Soldier in middle school which, for maybe a week, had my whole class thinking that somehow maybe those guys weren't such ass. Then there was the 2019 movie Aftermath which had at least two Nazis played by regulation-hotties. Combined these with knowing that a lot of Nazi soldiers, certainly not all or even most, were people who didn't believe in what they were doing but were forced to with either themselves or their families threatened if they did not.  \n\n\n Then you take all of that, put it into a pot with the InnocentX vs CorruptingY trope and stir it using a \"The Holocaust Never Happened\" narrative-ladle, into a pot that's the brain of a likely very young ~~and incredibly stupid~~ amateur writer, you get stories and requests like this.   \n\n\nI'm, again, not saying I agree with this. I most certainly would never write that type of story. I'm just saying that yes, it does still happen and here's why.",
