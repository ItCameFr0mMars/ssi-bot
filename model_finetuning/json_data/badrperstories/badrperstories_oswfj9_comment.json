It definitely sucks to be bluntly told off like that, but I'd try not to take it to heart (as much as possible) since it doesn't seem like super valid criticism.",

Sounds like an untimely coincidence? \n\nWhile I've definitely had writing partners that we just did not mesh at all, despite our posts matching in size. I feel like in any of those instances however, I would have immediately come to the conclusion that I wasn't a fan of their writing if only I had requested samples before hand. So it's very strange to me either of these people would have a problem with your writing after seeing samples. \n\nCould it be they just weren't a fan of the type of character you were portraying? I know that's often a deal breaker for some. Although the way you've made it sound is like they had an issue with your writing style in particular...\n\nSorry you had to deal with that! If you aren't having similar issues with other partners, maybe it isn't so bad. Or, if it's really something you want to try and 'correct' (if there is even a problem at all) things would be to find some type of unbias source for a writing critic?\n\nHonestly, it's hard to say.

The structure, your word, choice, etc. All excellent. \n\nI find myself to be a pretty good writer (not to toot my own horn) but I\u2019ve had someone just demolish my writing skills but to be honest it left me more confused than anything. \n\nThey were making a big deal of out of two or three of the same mistakes I made previously made (I think it was grammar mistakes or something pretty small) and other vague statements that I didn\u2019t really see pertain to my writing. Do I make mistakes and are there some aspects of my writing that I need to improve? Definitely. I maybe worry more than I should with most of my replies.\n\nHowever, this was an onslaught that really came out of basically nowhere and I for the life of me (other than the same couple of mistakes) could not see how it related to my writing. They previously tried forcing me into a Nazi-related side plot that I absolutely refused and they were pissed. The relationship ended shortly after all of this (onslaught and criticism came like days later). I\u2019m happy to hear criticism but damn just insulting my writing just makes me sad. \n\nAnyways sorry for the mini-story. Back to my point. I really think they wanted to end it for whatever reason or maybe they had other stuff going on (that probably pissed them off). They wanted to take the asshole route and criticize your writing rather than actually discussing their actual problems and making solutions, ending it peacefully, etc. It\u2019s rude and it makes you doubt your writing skills. It\u2019s good that they ended it because I definitely think they would of taken it out on you longer down the line. It\u2019s manipulative and not helpful at all. If you ever need to DM me if you want to discuss this further I would be happy to! This fucked me up for a while and I want to make sure you know this isn\u2019t your fault at all.",
