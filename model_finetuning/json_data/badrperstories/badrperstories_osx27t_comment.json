I\u2019m so ready.\n\nAm I correct in reading that this is a fandom prompt where you wish to play an OC against a canon character?\n\nI can't say I do that sort of RP, well... Ever, but I have on occasion and in extremely limited circumstances been the canon character against the OC, and remain in contact with friends who like doing that content. It seems to be a common thread that people who like to play the OC in these pairings really have sort of an uphill battle in finding people to play with.",

I love Warhammer 40k, for instance, but I also want good grammar, and post lengths that are long enough to describe this elaborate, baroque setting, and a partner willing to go along on this journey of discovering these atmospheres and places with me.  With that, I want to tell a story other than just the story of two people having romance and sex.  That cuts my potential partner base waaaay down.  I do find 40k partners, but they're spread out over time, and it can only happen by reposting my ad for it consistently (in accordance with the rules of the subreddits, always).  It's the same for my love of roleplaying in non-Skyrim Elder Scrolls.  \n\nYou have to be persistent and patient, and I recommend that in between looking for these roles that are most special to you, you also do some original stories or other rps you can still enjoy that aren't this one very specific thing.  It will help avoid frustration, and you will still be having fun while you wait for that perfect partner for your prompt.",
