It's kind of hard to do it at your own leisure if you're getting pestered into doing it \\[as this person definitely sounds young, if not immature and impatient\\]. \n\nYou handled it better than how most rpers are usually able to, as a lot of rpers just either give in and become unhappy/resentful or quietly ghost the person that's doing the sort of thing. Sometimes conflict's just unavoidable, as you need to set firm boundaries \\[and the way you said it honestly isn't rude in my opinion\\] or else people will walk all over you. Not wanting to rp every single breathing moment of your life is a pretty reasonable boundary to enforce. \n\nBut some people in the RP community just don't like hearing the word 'no' basically and become cranky and hostile when you dare to enforce any boundaries you have.",

That's why my post on looking for rp partners says friends. \n\nBecause I wanna make friends OUTSIDE of just rping. I haven't been on reddit long but I actually like making friends off here.
