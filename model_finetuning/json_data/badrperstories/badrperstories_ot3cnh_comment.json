I've had a similar situation to yours, except the partner outright called my character boring rip. I mean unless if I agree to rp some kind of toxic relationship scenario, I just immediately get annoyed if someone tries to paint my character in an abusive light \\[especially when the said character either isn't abusive by nature or is trying to improve themselves\\].\n\nBut basically the whole deal was that they presented with this 'weak' character that was hurt and the like, seeking treatment at the hospital... My character was pretty much one of those characters those sort of soft-spoken, kind of grumpy but incredibly big-hearted dudes. And he was the nurse that took care of their character.  He even offer to let their character stay at their place \\[as this character was also homeless\\] and the character offered to repay him by sleeping with him \\[and my character refused\\]. They're the ones that ended the rp and basically called my character boring as they wanted a hyper-masculine macho man that would just use and abuse their character. I wish I could say I dumped them but since I was desperate I rped with them for a little bit more until I got bored of playing the abusive dick of their dreams lol. \n\nI mean I just think that your partner is looking for something different and they're just not being outright about their wants. So I think it's totally fair to be upset, as it's not like the rp was getting any better \\[and in fact it sounded like it was getting worse, so when is it supposed to 'get better????\\]. It just sounds like to me that they want you to play the abusive dick of their dreams while their character is the victim that gets used and abused by yours imo.",

The bad part is, it's kind of hard for partners to know how to respond. You could try stuff like:\n\nV can see reluctance written all over H's face, despite their agreement. \"What's the matter H? I thought you wanted this?\"\n\nThen maybe H verbalizes the abusive mother history and V and H can have a character growth moment. Or not.\n\nOne other point I'd like to make, is that a vampire kidnapping a human is an inherently abusive situation. I don't really see how you can play the vampire without being a little abusive. Maybe H doesn't want to go on a vampire quest, and really just wants V to retire to a farm with them. Maybe what you're missing is a plot reason for H to want to do this.

            "body": "/Posting from throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nA lot of people tend to want things like this in their RP but don't really want to admit it. I replied to an ad once that was looking for a villain to match their character with, which was fine. But they were very, *VERY* insistent that they wanted no abuse happening at *all.* They stated this very blatantly and repeatedly, making an entire point of it. So, like a normal person, I was respectful and made sure that even though my character was a terrible person, that he was always careful to treat their character kindly.\n\nAnyway, apparently my character's puppy love was a problem for them and as the RP went on they kept trying, both ic and ooc, to goad me into doing that exact thing. Their character would be constantly terrified and would say completely unprompted; \"You aren't planning to do [x] to me, are you?\" And they themselves would nudge me occasionally with advice like \"maybe my character would be a bit easier to deal with if you roughed him up a little.\" What really cinched it for me though was them telling me that most of their (online) friends would cut them off completely if they knew they wrote stuff like this. It gave such mixed messages that in the end, I got uncomfortable and had to leave.\n\nI've also had abusive characters develop into very caring and considerate people after falling in love, only to have that be very blatantly ignored by the other person. Sometimes to the point of them even hitting my character in order to finally provoke an violent reaction out of him, and then acting like it was him who started the fight when he very vocally tried to de-escalate beforehand by saying \"I'm trying to be a better person, so please let me just step away.\" So, same hat, basically.\n\nMost of my characters tend to be villains so this kind of thing actually happens to me a lot. Some people have a nasty view of abusive pairings and the people who write them and as a result they want to view themselves as \"not like that\" and put the expectation on you to steadily dive into that territory for them. I'd even be fine with writing something like that if they just asked, but they won't and because of that it makes for a really awkward dynamic. Eventually I learned to just leave when this happens, since partners who do this can be pretty toxic and it's just not worth it imo. \n\nIf I were you, I'd try to figure out what kind of dynamic your partner is *actually* looking for and if it's not abusive, then ask how much time their character needs to come around and what it would take to make that happen. Communication is key to making an RP work so if they really do want a healthy relationship, there's nothing wrong with asking directly and clearing the details up ahead of time.",

            "body": "No. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re oversensitive. At first reading it I was going to say maybe you\u2019re were overreacting just a bit if you didn\u2019t discussed it with said partner (they can\u2019t be a mind-reader after all). You didn\u2019t implicitly say it, but after reaching the end I\u2019m pretty sure you did (I could be wrong or I\u2019m just stupid). It does hurt when your partner tries forcing your character in roles you don\u2019t want them to be in. \n \nI\u2019ve had something super similar happen (yes if anyone has seen my early post or comments this is with old partner who tried forcing me into Nazi plot). I had a female character (F) who was extremely manipulative and abusive towards her character (M). We discussed it before hand and we were going for a psychological horror story (based on the manga/anime Tokyo Ghoul) that involved a lot of betrayal, manipulation, murder, gore, etc. It was dark. Extremely dark. She was okay with it, and I was too. \n\nAlthough my character was certainly abusive and manipulative in many ways, she had some good to her as well. Granted, none of that good ever pertained to M, but she still had some good. What got me super irritated was that old partner insistently try to arm-charm psychoanalysis her all the fricking time. I\u2019m all for character discussions and analyses but old partner would insistently label her as a narcissist and later psychopath. Not just like \u201coh I personally find her to have this mental disorder(s) but that\u2019s my interpretation!!\u201d Cool! I love discussing things like that. \n\nHowever, for old partner it was more like \u201cI think she has this and I\u2019m going to repeatedly insist you must think this too and I want you to change her bio etc.\u201d Like dude. It\u2019s my character. You can interrupt her like that and you can certainly hold that opinion don\u2019t force me to change my beliefs about my own fricking character. \n\nHonestly I think that\u2019s why she wanted the whole Nazi plot with F as Nazi scientist/experimenter and M as the prisoner. It was because of her so-called interpretation and thought F would be perfect for such a situation. Or she just wanted me to do this plot from the get-go and thought trying to label my character with such disorders so I would be more willing to do it. I don\u2019t know. Not sure. \n\nUnlucky for her I wanted no such thing and it was way too fucked up for so many reasons. Not to mention F would of never done such a thing. She would also go ballistic if I made minor character suggestions so that was also a bonus. \n\nIt really sucks when people force your characters to take on roles or force them to behave uncharacteristically, even if they might of done similar things in the past. It our characters are your characters. It\u2019s as simple as that.",

            "body": "You're not being overly sensitive, I've been in a similar situation and it's not fun.\n\nA few years ago I was writing a villain: powerful, manipulative, violent, etc. But I had this plot going with someone where my villain's team came across their OC, saved them from a dangerous situation and brought them into his group and under his wing. Because of this, the OC got comfortable and wasn't as afraid of him as most others were. In fact they even developed feelings for him. This is the specific idea the person came to me with and I agreed to it. It was something different when most plots I got involved a typical hero vs villain sort of thing.\n\nMonths later, out of the blue, the OC brings up the time that my character tortured them. Except... we never discussed my character doing this to them. While he *has* tortured people, it was rare and he only ever did so when he had reason to, and he's had no reason to hurt her. Not only this, but later my partner started writing about how their OC was emotionally traumatized by him. Again, we had never discussed this, nor ever written anything happening between them that would cause trauma. But then, the OC was supposedly still in love with him, essentially making the whole dynamic into something toxic and abusive when that was never the plan from my point of view. It kind of ruined the whole thing for me.",
