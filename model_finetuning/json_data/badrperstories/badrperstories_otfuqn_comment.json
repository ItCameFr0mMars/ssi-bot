            "body": "Speaking as someone who honestly used to idealize Elitists in RP, once I was able to easily and comfortably hit their golden standards, what I found is that most of them honestly are terrible. Don't get me wrong, on a technical level, they have the perfect grammar, never a typo, perfect punctuation, and I get pages of content to potentially work with.   \n\n\nBut when I read the actual content? I don't know how anyone can derive entertainment from it. Most of it is just fluff. It's them describing what their character is feeling or thinking without any physical cues to let my character know either. Or my personal favourite, it's them using their character plus a handful of NPCs to pad their post - to the point that if you take out the NPCs, their character's post would just be the four sentences they complain about getting from others. I get so **profoundly bored** when I write with people like this. I end up pulling teeth to get anything from my muse, because I'm so uninspired by what I've been given and I refuse to devolve into introspective fluff just to flex. At this point, I don't feel like I have anything to prove to anyone. I always strive to be a better writer, but I also am comfortable with what I give.  \n\n\nA friend of mine once told me that when she sees writing sample requirements as gates in group servers, she leaves because it's essentially telling all new players that the server doesn't give a shit about who they are as people, all they care about is the prose which usually indicates a server full of assholes. I apply that same context to individual players. If writing length is their metric for a \"good writer\" much less a \"good writing partner,\" then that tells me all I need to know about where their values are and it's not the story, so I'm not interested.",

No one's grammar is perfect all the time, so someone claiming that is likely a victim of the inability to perceive their own flaws and errors, an absolutely fatal thing in a writing partner.  I see a fair number of ads from people who sound pompous and forego contractions, but still make basic comma and spelling errors, and they use words out of their proper definition or context as if they're plucked from a thesaurus without the writer ever seeing them used in a sentence.

Like, yeah, you can do dialogue via one liners and descriptions of the world via novella, but does doing that tend to make for better RP? I don't think so.\n\nAnd snobbery is anti-thetical to the idea of a living language. The marks of very skilled writers are things like being able to portray an accent, manner of speaking, or complicated emotions in dialogue, all things that could be interpreted as errors by someone with a stiffer metric of determining what's \"right\".

Finally, moving down from the extreme \"perfect\" writers we start to get the best kind of roleplay writers, who care about the story but have figured out that sometimes condensing your writing so it flows better is just as important as cramming it with details. This is the best kind of roleplaying you can find these days imo, and it's way more valuable than finding someone with the strictest requirements for writing with them while lacking all creativity and fun.",

            "body": "I'll admit, I'm a picky partner. I don't need perfection from a partner, but I want to make sure they have a grasp on grammar and punctuation. (typos totally happen!) I think it's totally reasonable for people to have preferences in who they write with. I would be super overwhelmed if I accepted every roleplay inquiry without a vetting process.\r  \n\r  \nI understand that not everyone operates like that... And that's totally fine! No hard feelings if we're not compatible. That being said, I can definitely see where you're coming from if people are bitching about not finding partners due to strict guidelines. Meanwhile, I'll take one or two partners, then scuttle back into the dark hole I crawled out of to just roleplay with those one or two people for the next few months (or years!).\r  \n\r  \nI've definitely have had experiences with advanced-lit \"elitism\" kind of turn into roleplays dying out real quick. Where people are more concerned with meeting a 2000-5000 word minimum, and it becomes a chore, and just fizzles out before going anywhere. Being able to conjure up long winded, beautifully worded replies does not mean a person is creative (because creativity is most important!)\r  \n\r  \nI see where you're coming from. I think acting all elite is kinda bullshit, but I don't think there is anything wrong with being picky. I've only become picky myself after establishing what I do, and do not enjoy in roleplays. Then again, I'm not bitching about not finding roleplays either.",
