It\u2019s either because we get uninspired quickly, not really sure what to do next, can\u2019t fill in the gaps, burnout in the first few pages, terrible at climaxes, characters development, etc. I genuinely write at my best with another person. \n\nI think some people might want to consider the option of writing by themselves. However, publishing such stories is a long and exhausting road. The publishing industry is tough and you have to make connections to even get semi-recognized (couple of my mom\u2019s friends are authors). Self-publishing is also an option, but it takes a hell of a lot of work. \n\nTo be honest this really just feels weirdly like a callout post or you\u2019re trying to police people\u2019s who might tend to fall in these categories from not roleplaying. People roleplay for various different reasons, and some people might be looking to fulfill a role in someone\u2019s else stories. I\u2019m not really sure why you posted this in an roleplay-based subreddit. You seem to think that publishing your own story is a quick, easy solution. \n\nRoleplaying is easier, often times a lot more fun, and you make a lot of friends from doing this.

It can definitely be fun when I'm able to keyboard slam out a plot I'm excited to do, but stringing things together from Fun Plot A to Fun Plot B and making it coherent isn't easy.\n\nIn the time it takes me to write a chapter, usually a couple thousand words, I can have easily written double that in RPs. The interactivity makes a massive difference.\n\nDefinitely agreeing with you on how this feel callouty/gatekeeping.",

I totally forgot to mention the character thing too. I legit get so sick of interacting with only myself it drives me insane.\n\nThe plot contingency (from fun Plot A to Plot B like you said lol) is also huge for me too. I write the cool climaxes, but I can\u2019t for the life of me find anything to fill in the gaps.  I have done some solo writing and have finished a couple of my own short stories. However, like you, when I roleplay I turn out double if not triple the content I would when solo writing. I love interacting with my partners. \n\nI can\u2019t disagree you about the way this post feels as well. Gatekeeping is a good way to describe it.",

For some it might be a decent sized post, but for others that amount comes super super easily to where it's a very obtainable goal. I don't require word minimums of my partners, however I rarely write below 300 words unless I'm specifically in a rut, or it's \"snap snap snap\" keeping the scene moving. \n\nIf your standard is a minimum of 300 words, but someone else struggles, or it's a chore to reach that amount... Well, then you just might not be compatible writers, and that's not a big deal. Not everyone is meant to be compatible with everyone.\n\nNow, if you pair the \"300 word minimum\" with \"rapid fast replies\", then I'd see your point. But I don't require rapid fast replies no matter the post size. \n\nMost of your other points, I kind of get your point. But all in all, I don't think I'll personally get into solo writing. It's not my jam. Half of the fun of roleplaying is the collaborative effort, and going back and forth with a partner with plotting, or creating characters together, etc. But I suppose other than maybe that point bullet point I've disagreed with you on, I'm not (likely) your target audience for this post.",

If you're the type that needs to feel like everything has to cater to you and your tastes, you're going to have a bad time.   \n\n\nThe main point I wanted to touch on though, was number three.   \n\"Your view on roleplaying and usage has morphed into something unhealthy (IE. Coping mechanism) or you don't treat it like a fun hobby and instead it's a 9-5 job to you and you expect \u201cprofessionalism\u201d in roleplay interactions.\"  \n\n\nMinus the bits about a job where players are expected to be online multiple times a day, churning out content; I do think that being professional to a degree is valid, especially if you're the game runner. You're leading a game and people are trusting you with their characters and their stories. Not being professional is a recipe for disaster. I'm not saying not to joke around and make friends, but there is a line.   \n\n\nBut my biggest disagreement to number three is that RP has to exclusively be this fun, light-hearted thing. It's actually really common for RP to be used as a tool in therapy to cope and help work through trauma in a safe way, in a safe place, at your own pace. If people are healing and working through their trauma through the proxy of a character, then, respectfully, *who the actual fuck do you think you are telling them they're in any way wrong?*   \n\n\nDon't like it? Leave. It's as simple as that. But fuck all this gate-keeping.",

When I was younger, between 9-15, I did a LOT of script RPing because I was intimidated by the more in depth RPing. \n\nNow I've really found a fondness for para-style, and I just want the same from my partners. Being 30 years old, I expect that same level of RPing skill mostly due to AGE. Most people my age have done things like go to college or work some sort of job that requires a level of writing that is on par with mine.\n\nThat doesn't make me an elitist - that makes me someone who expects a level of writing skill for their age. It's also why I make my age cap 24+. I even spell this out in every single one of my ads. If my ad intimidates someone or even makes them disinterested in RPing with me, then it's their choice to move on.\n\nI feel like a lot of the people who make 'elistist' rants are people who want to RP with people like you and I, but they want us to be on THEIR level. That's...not how that works. You can't want to play Basketball and asked Lebrone James to play 'at their level' so you can play with him. That's not how that works...",

My first thoughts were \u201cwhy does this pertain to the sub like at all\u201d and \u201cwhere the *hell* are the mods.\u201d Seriously not everyone roleplays in the same specific way. I have know plenty of people who also just roleplay to fulfill someone else\u2019s character or role. Is it my type of thing? Nope. However I don\u2019t make a callout post like this on a bad rp sub. Also what\u2019s with OP listing off pretty generic things and telling people to get into solo writing? Like a good chunk of people roleplay because they hate solo writing among other things. Probably the first thing they tried before getting roleplaying. Again. No clue why this post is here. Has some good points, but this is more for r/writing.",

I've been roleplaying for 20 years now, and some elitist prick on the internet wants to tell me I'm doing it wrong because it's not their preferred way to play? Like who made them judge and jury?
