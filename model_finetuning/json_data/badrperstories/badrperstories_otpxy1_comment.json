Thankfully it seems this style is still alive and well over Discord, but it seems many here would think poorly of these places, even though one of the best rps I have played was in this format and only ended last year. I'm literate and I get my point across, I feel like I have good characterization and the stories flow well, but most importantly I and my partners have fun. I think that should be enough.",

Even though I like writing long responses (which can easily go into the novella range) I sometimes do actually get frustrated since I know what I want to write, and yet it is still taking a fucking hour out of my day. Yeah.  \n\n\nSorry you've had to deal with this, OP. Some people simply like to be mean, and there is a lot of elitism going on within the community. (And frankly, throughout my \"roleplaying career\" I've been no saint.)  \nI only don't know what to say to the labels regarding the lengths of the post and the amount of detail you put into them. I can see why using the labels such as \"literate\" or \"advanced literate\" can be hurtful, but... does anyone have any idea how to replace them?",

I am flexible to a degree though, but only to a degree - I think that the word count of around 350 is the lowest I would be willing to agree.  \n\n\nBut before I digress further, shorter responses just don't do it to some people.

And terms like \"advanced-lit\" just upping that scale... Or \"semi-literate\" to describe still paragraph form, but just less dedicated to long form? If that makes sense? lol\n\nI wouldn't call someone who doesn't consider themselves in the writing category of \"literate\" as \"illiterate\" (again, that just sounds rude)... I'd just assume they either write script, or short form replies. \\*shrugs\\*\n\nThat being said, I don't use those terms often to describe my writing, personally. Not whenever I'm advertising myself, anyway. I prefer stating I write para-posts and I give me usual post size averages. I do think the terms are a bit silly to get super into, but I do see where they are coming from. And maybe new terms should be used in place of \"literate\".

When in started years ago, literate meant you would write using quotes for dialogue, decent grammar/punctuation, and  your best concrete detail. Now literate means writing posts a 5000 miles long, unecessarily advanced grammar/punctuation, etc. \n\nI tend to gravitate toward the people who request semi-lit/lit.

I was matching someone who really wanted to write with me, but her writing was largely introspective so I grew bored very fast. I mentioned it multiple times that I wasn't feeling the RP, nothing really changed. Finally I told her I would not be continuing. She pushed me for an answer as to why, as if I hadn't already told her multiple times, and when I finally said \"I am bored,\" she kicked me from the server and then reported me to the forum we met on saying she wanted a DNC. People with egos like that will always pitch a fit at the first sign that their writing isn't someone else's preference. It's not your problem though, just like it wasn't mine. \n\nIn that situation, I gave 3 soft warnings that I wasn't enjoying the RP. She tried to correct things, but ultimately it was just her style of writing that I found I couldn't collaborate with. Finally, I told her I would not continue. She asked a few times before the \"I am bored\" comment, where I was as polite as possible. She kept pushing because she really wanted to write with me, which I was flattered by, but there's only so many times I can say \"no\" before I'm going to shout in their face. \n\nAll any of us ca do is try to be good people, because this is a passion-driven hobby for all of us. RP is writing, writing is art, art is passion. Passion always has ego attached, just at different levels. There's still never a reason to, at a first attempt, be mean. Try it the nice way first to express your boundaries, and if they don't respect them - block the person and move on. Anything else is inviting unnecessary drama into your life.",
