You get people wanting fandoms, state you don\u2019t do them. You getting people pushing erp only ideas? State that you\u2019ll ignore/block them. Give an example of what you like (you state you like fantasy yet are willing to do anything, what sort of things won\u2019t you do?).\n\nThat way you\u2019re still saying \u201cgive me yer plots\u201d but culling the amount of people who\u2019ll send you the first thing that pops into their heads.\n\nI understand your frustration but there\u2019s a solution to it.",

They reply with things that are good high-fantasy ideas with a solid plotline, but something ethereal about it just isn't appealing and I can't even put my finger on what it is and therefore could not possibly put it in an ad.\n\nAgain, I don't know how this is confusing for you. It's not possible for me to list in minute detail every single thing I could possibly be interested in RPing. I list my own ideas and get people not interested in helping to drive the plot back, so I did this instead, and got better results.\n\nI'm going to say it again: posting an ad does not obligate me to RP with ANYONE\n\nI'm also going to say this again: I have had no trouble at all finding partners, I've just also found a few assholes.

I think that the problem with your search is that it will lead to nearly everyone sending you their plots, as it is so broad.\n\n\\-you say that people shouldn't contact you if they just do ERP and with BDSM plots, but how much ERP is really wanted? Is 50 % ERP and 50 % story okay? Do you only do limited ERP scenes after a few pages of writing? Would you be okay with zero ERP, or is that even what you want? That isn't clear at all. \n\n\\-you say that fantasy is your wheelhouse, but you like modern day stuff, too. That is a bit confusing, as Urban fantasy is modern day fantasy. I would suspect you mean that you like medieval fantasy and stuff like that the most, but are also open for that? Or does this mean you write fantasy but also slice of life without fantasy?\n\nThe fact that your ad is so open is a bit...unfortunate. Because instead of attracting 8 people that are open to roleplay plots that you are really open to write (and then saying 'no sorry' to four of them plus an additional two who did not read your search), you get 20+ ads and most of them are not your cup of tea anyway.\n\nI get the allure of posting an ad like that, but for me (and I am someone who loves to contribute to the plot), ads like this seem a little bit like 'You do all the work, I will not even tell you what I like the most or answer some little questions of yours beforehand so that you can tailor a plot that fits my interest, and then ditch you the moment someone better comes along, good luck', and it feels a bit like a job interview and not fun planning with a partner who sees me as an equal writing partner.\n\nBy no means you have to write with everyone, and expecting that would be idiotic. But with ads like that, I think people have to be careful that they do not seem like 'Entertain me and maybe I will spend some of my precious time on the plot that your wasted your evening on creating'.",
