But this requires the *right* person...\n\nThe type of person you're describing is unfortunately the more common outcome. And OF COURSE, they just want smut lmao. Whenever it comes to actually trying to break things down interesting from super simple pairings/roles, they send a plot that seems loosely based from bad porn attempting a 'story', or just scenarios that will lead to the quickest outcome of characters boning.",

Oh man, it dies fast.\n\nAnd then, if say I have a \"smut heavy\" plot with an actually really engaging writer, things will start off pretty smutty as the characters are kind of developing that sort of bond-- Buuuut it does not stay the focus for long. We'll either just no longer feel the need to even mention acts of smut, because it can be assumed these characters have a sexual relationship so no more need to include it constantly, OR, it's like, \"Oh hey, a smut scene is coming up, you wanna just skip along to after?\" lol. Because. Yeah. There is only so many ways to write out smut before it's like, alright lets move on.\n\nSometimes steamy plots can be fun. As in, it's great for building a characters relationship dynamic... But after that, it's time to focus on plot. The people who want to jump into smut right away for the sake of jumping into smut; more than likely, it's not going to last very long.",
