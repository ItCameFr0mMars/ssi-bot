But it's totally not okay to just shame people for enjoying writing out posts.\n\nAnd then people assume that long posts = filler and fluff. Uhhh, if you feel the need to fluff up your post for length, then you're writing for the wrong reason. \n\nI've said it about a million times already, but I'll say it again because I'm still seeing people getting hate for having preferences: If a persons post size requirement does not fit what you enjoy writing... Don't shame them. Just **MOVE ON.** Just like I'm not going to message someone who does short form writing or script, and except them to meet my preferences. And I am most definitely not going to shame them about it.",

Long posts can have a lot of content in them and if they're just being overbloated for the sake of it then they are indeed a poor writer.  \nAnd like: i understand. You might feel excluded from people because you don't do long posting, and I agree that some who do long posting are elitists, but the preference itself is fine. If you see that you don't match with someone when it comes to posting length just move the fuck on. Would you argue about any other preference in an ad? ... well, many people would, but that is off the point.  \nI know for a fact I would not enjoy exchanging back and forth replies whose length would be consistently below 350 words, not to mention if it was below 200 words, but I also don't go out of my way to shame people who don't write as much as I do. I will shame short responses if they're laughable for other reasons that just the fact that they're short, but I would just as gladly laugh at nonsensical responses that'd match my usual length in roleplaying.  \n\n\nAnyhow: no, criticizing advanced and novella writers is not the way to defend short posting.

I hold to my very strict standards on minimum post length and the quality of my partners has improved pretty significantly.  \n\nPeople say what you're saying but honestly where in an adv lit or novella rp would there be a time in a story when all there was to write was just a few lines?  Nowhere tbh.  I can't remember the last time there was for me since I moved into adv lit.  And damn if it wouldn't be hard as hell to regain momentum after something like that.",

If the writing is good, I don\u2019t see why I should set some arbitrary requirement. If I send a substantial post, they\u2019ll probably reply similarly. If they send me a one-liner, there\u2019s probably a good reason for it. Pacing is another important part of RP, but it falls by the wayside because of people who got it stuck in their heads that length = quality, who think one-liners are some cardinal sin.",

None of those things are told by a post length requirement but usually I get a good idea when talking to them before we start something.  \n\n\nI've personally used very short posts knowingly as a way to add a full stop or emphasis in a scene. This requires knowing how to use literary tools like rhythm and structure flow in the course of a collaborative roleplay and having partners you communicate well enough with to know that it is a deliberate choice.  \n\n\nFor a direct example, many years ago, I was roleplaying as a neonate vampire. She'd just managed to royally fuck up. Her sire gave her a full on 5 or 6 paragraph lecture detailing exactly how she'd fucked up and at the end of it my response was a single word, \"Oh.\" it was absolutely perfect for the situation, it derailed the lecture and put us back on course to get back to the action going on in the story which had to do with trying to keep an antediluvian torpored and only indirectly affecting events around us.",

So I don't think that everyone is going to \"pad the post out\" even without realizing it. I write what I want to write, not because I'm meeting a limit.\n\nI think the \"requirements\" of post sizes are less so people \"obsessed with length\", and more so people just trying to find others that write in the same ballpark as them.\n\nLength does not equal quality, and I've had poor writers who write a lot. But, my partners that I do stick around with and happen to write a lot with are fucking awesome. I don't have to think \"oh shit, I need to make this longer\". If that's happening, then maybe writing longer posts just doesn't come naturally for a person.\n\nI actually have some partners who prefer short form, and I enjoy their writing enough that I'm chill with it. But those are people I know are very good at their craft, even if they only pop out 200 words a post.\n\nAll in all, I'm not picky about size. Sometimes I gotta throw a short ball in there to keep things moving because I'm stuck. It just comes down to what comes naturally for some and may be difficult for others. I'm not going to have a fit if I'm given an occasional 200 word post.\n\nI'm pretty flexible personally... And agree quantity does not equal quality. That being said: Absolutely, never send me a one-liner lmao. I'd rather hear that you don't know what to write and we can work something out. But there is never ever an instance that I think \"well I'm stuck. One line!\" If that's the case, shit might be dead. (speaking as a para-poster. If you're writing script, go ham with one-liners. I will never get into script personally.)",

I don't prefer one over the other, or have anything against either. \n\nThe only thing I've had had a problem with had nothing to do with length, but length could sometimes be a factor in these types of replies:\n\nWhen rp partners have a whole scene with an NPC, or a flashback (often including dialogue), and at the very end of the scene will barely acknowledge your character even exists in their sphere at all. It never feels like we're writing together. It feels like I'm just reading a fanfiction and my character happens to be present but uninvolved.\n\nIf I'm writing with someone who doesn't acknowledge or interact with my character (aloud OR in their head) and just seems to be performing or writing long monologues that in no way involve our story, character relationship, mutual circumstances, events, or anything that my character could respond to or relate to, I get frustrated.",

They're not necessarily directly attacking someone's style, just sharing what is on their mind. People feel relieved to know they're not alone.  \n\n I think everyone wants a rich story with vivid details. Long posting isn't a necessity to get there, but it's easier to write all that in 500+ words than it is to limit yourself at 200. On the other hand short posting isn't automatically a bad thing and neither is long posting. Both have pros and cons, and it's all up to preferences. Sometimes those preferences change, and that's up to a roleplayer and their partner to decide.",
