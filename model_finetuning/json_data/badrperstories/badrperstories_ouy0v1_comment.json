            "body": "I'm not even sure what to say, OP, other than a sincere and heartfelt apology in solidarity, because I've also had RP used to abuse me.\n\nUnfortunately, though, mine was irl. We would do \"acting\" roleplay, jumping into character and improving in real time together, like we were on stage or larping. It got so frequent and deep that we'd often lose ourselves in the characters and blur our own selves into the characters.\n\nBut where I had some limits to when and how much I could tolerate, I never stated them because I didn't want to lose her or the thing that made her happy. I also didn't notice the other signs of abuse and manipulation until much later that led into the roleplay abuse, but she did in fact use it to twist my emotions and condition me into thinking the OC's desires were totally okay to express and if I tried to \"trade back\" myself to be \"me\" for too long she'd get distressed and insist we switch back again because it was fun or whatever to be \"another person\". It eventually led to some... Questionable and regrettable choices on my part.\n\nI would be gaslit and guilted whenever I wanted to enjoy something as \"me\", as she painted it as \"selfish\".\n\nI vastly regret letting her convince me to \"roleplay\" through a very special vacation we took that is tainted in my memory because I spent 2 out of 7 days as \"me\" doing what \"I\" wanted, and the other 5 sliding in and out of character for long periods because \"they\" should be allowed to experience a new country and setting. It would be \"fun\" to see them react. If I fell out of character I was met with guilt. If I referred to myself in 3rd person to try and break immersion, I was met with guilt.\n\nI was expected to trade my life and goals for an OC because she wanted to live their life instead of her own and I went with it because I was being isolated from my friends and family and had no emotional stability of my own to see what was happening, no witnesses to call her out.\n\nSo yes. RP can absolutely be used as emotional and sexual abuse, and it will haunt you for a long time.\n\nBut your feelings are valid and your experience is real.\n\nIt should not have happened. But it's not your fault it did.\n\nAnd if you need to talk any more about it because it's such a niche thing to have happen, you can DM me. I'll listen, I'll rant with you, or you can just scream into a void about your feelings on it to someone who won't judge you for it.\n\nI'm truly, very, immensely glad you got away from her and found someone who really cares for you, and hope that the experience will deflate and become a haze that doesn't hurt anymore so much as simply annoy in time.",

Although it\u2019s taken a while, I think one of my old partners abused me emotionally and in some ways groomed me. Thankfully not sexually or physically like yours, and I didn\u2019t know her in irl so I also dodged a bullet with that. She was emotionally manipulative for sure, and it got to the point I was so dependent on her I was willing to actually *pay* her to reply and not ghost me. I was also a minor, and she was a lot older (however she was under the pretenses I was a fresh adult. Like a couple of days of turning 18 which was kinda weird that she was okay with that). \n\nI\u2019m not going to go into explicit details of everything she did, I did explain some of it with earlier posts. However, for like the longest time I was like \u201cwhy *did* I feel this way? I could of ended it at any time. Besides, you can\u2019t abuse someone online/rping, right?\u201d I\u2019ve never really heard of anyone else talk about it other than a couple of brief mentions or some were just in denial (which is okay and I was in for a long time). \n\nGlad you got out and I hope you know you\u2019d not the only one. It\u2019s not discussed at all or hardly at all and I sometimes feel like I\u2019m crazy for even suggesting that she was abusive in any way possible. She had her problems for sure, and I certainly had mine. However, I\u2019ve realized what she did was not okay and I\u2019m glad you did too. Have a nice day!",

It will still process, but it will be much slower... So I would suggest finding someone or somewhere that you can feel secure and try to go into it head on to burn hot and fast, but that's completely up to you if you think you can handle the emotions and hurt. Otherwise, bits and pieces.\n\nThere's no wrong way for it, save for pushing it away entirely for the rest of your life. But no matter what, it is the past, and going forward at all is better than staying put. Good feelings to you",

It doesn't get talked about, so it doesn't get recognized, and no one will stop it, so it stays quiet.\n\nMaybe with the door opened now, we as a community can address the fact that RP can absolutely be used for severe harm and a tool in manipulation and abuse so we can make the community safer.",
