            "body": "It's not wrong to feel upset by an assumption that you didn't act on, which is a normal but mature avenue to take. Yes, accidents happen with similarities cropping up at times, and certain things being all incidentally and coincidentally linked together and repeating across certain designs does happen though it's very iffy to blow off as only coincidence in some circumstances.\n\nPeople do derive inspiration from things they like, and less skilled artists and writers don't always have the ability to mask it well as inslir so it seems like a rip off.\n\nOther times, it definitely IS a rip off, especially when things such as very small details are being copied, like a niche clothing style (such as a tribal two piece with red and off white patterns that are very distinct in concept) or a hair pattern or tattoo pattern that's a little too odd to be a coincidence (a hair color set that directly comes from a bird of paradise or specific Maori tattoos across the nose and chin).\n\nThat's unfortunately the thing about being good at anything from concept to design: someone is going to like it, want it, and copy it. It's not always malicious either, but it is hard to ignore when it's a small group. I had it happen to me in one where I put out a character design that was very specifically white and gray with dark leopard spots across the back and very fluffy. The OC was popular and someone who had a character but no design commissioned a sheet for them that was very strikingly similar to mine in terms of white and gray with leopard spots on the back and long fur, in a group where mine was the only other one with that specific aesthetic, so it was very much thought to be a copy, as their OC had no public description available to check against.\n\nYour comfort with this occurence is up to you, but I'd be more concerned about them copying both the design AND the OC's meta elements such as name, backstory, abilities, etc. One is a coincidence, two is a cause for concern, because at that point that same person could either:\n\nA) be intentionally taking bits to apply to their own OCs for attention in terms of them taking aesthetic for one OC and info for another but it both happening with one specific user, generating a behavior pattern of copying you\n\nOr B) they're actually trying to duplicate your OC entirely for god only knows what reason and it's definitely them being uncreative or lazy by taking and mildly editing a pre-existing character, which is easy to spot as well because it's unlikely that two OCs will look almost the same and have the same meta info by accident.\n\nHow you handle this is up to your comfort, but I can at least advise bringing it up to a mod so they can either judge the copy merit or keep an eye open for more possible copies of future OCs.\n\nIf you don't think you can handle the possibility of younger or less experienced people taking inspiration and not being able to hide it well (not take criticism of said inspiration if confronted) then I wouldn't pursue the hobby, or at least seek more mature or smaller groups who are less likely to do this without at least asking.\n\nIt's how I resolved my duplicate at least, though it wasn't actually taken down. I told the then-owner and she made note that she didn't realize how similar the designs were but we couldn't prove it was an actual copy at the time, and the OC never got used once thereafter so we dropped it, leaving a pin in there for future \"oops dupes\" from that person (who also dipped out of the group eventually due to reasons).\n\nThis is all up to you, but whatever you feel, as long as you aren't starting a war over it without objective reason then you aren't wrong in feeling it. OCs are precious and personal ones always hit harder than small side doodles when someone infringes on them, even by accident, so I don't fault you at all for being upset and uncomfortable, but I can't give you a direct yes or no solution.\n\nI do hope my spiel helps though, and it doesn't result in being an actual ripoff situation.",

You put a lot of time and effort into creating your characters, which isn't even taking into account the emotional attachment that I think everyone has to their creations. Investment is normal - you just need to ensure that you handle and address it in a healthy way. \n\nAre all these characters from the same person or different people? And is it only the appearance being copied or personality/history/abilities too? Either way, if it's bothering you, and if multiple other people think there's something going on, then personally I would recommend bringing it up to staff hat you feel there's some copying going on. \n\nSure, sometimes newer roleplayers try to copy your plots or characters because they admire what you're doing and they want to do it too. But imitation hardly feels like flattery when it's your stuff being imitated. Especially when it's bordering copying or theft.",

The only reason it was a bit uncomfortable for me as an artist was.\n\nTo give an example, each had the same hair/eye color as my oc. While also using exact color schemes. They copied facial features as well. They had the same likes and dislikes. Clothing style, and interest. Someone even took my characters personality and it was written almost exactly the same as how I wrote mine. It just seemed like they changed some words to seem less obvious (this was minimal one sentence was exactly written like mine.) . Another had the same exact occupation as my OC, similar backstory. Interest. And a beauty mark in the same location. Even the earrings were the same shape as my OC, The only huge difference was a skin tone readjustment. Another even had the hair covering over the eye like mine. While I had a specific design for their makeup with speckles under the eye. They imitated the design exactly. Which another artist had spoken up about but no one really responded something like. So I knew I was not the only one seeing it. (These are all just things I noticed but unfortunately I think its hard to be extremely forthright in a crowd of rpyers.)  \n\n\nI think unfortunately its not exact copying but heavy influence that makes me a bit uncomfortable in the community. I have decided to step away from it because from what I learned recently this has been an ongoing problem in this particular rp community so I think it might be best to find a better avenue.",
