I remember every day before school I would go to the library to use the computers before class and I would respond to a neomail roleplay and read manga til school started. I was doing a sonic rp and a friend read aloud over my shoulder and I still remember what the line was even if I don't remember the context: Shadow was aghast, \"You mean, it's true?\"\n\nAnd yes the edgy characters. I had a digimon character whose dad was yakuza and forced her to work for him so her brother didn't have to. She was a murderer and hated it so she cut herself every time she had to kill someone and she was just sooooo tragic. Plus I totally gave her my own name.

            "body": "Most of mine are the standard, some of the tropes you have there as well; primarily the I-was-12-and-awful-at-this. I was never on neopets but had very similar experiences on Gaia online. My posts were awful. I recall remaking roleplays all the time because people were offline and it was easier to make a new one. \n\nI remember, in particular, my real life best friend and I deciding to make a guild. (If you\u2019re not familiar with Gaia they are basically private forums you have to join to post on.) This began with a lengthy period of saving up gold to afford to buy one, because to us they were a fortune at that time. Finally we made it. It was a roleplaying guild because that was like all we did. We wrote a \u201cguide\u201d on what we expecting of literacy, starting at awful posts and then step by step showing people how they could improve \u2014 my god was it cringy thinking back, we had no idea what the hell we were doing! Someone should probably have taught us.\n\nThe WORST. Thing though was actually in one of  our highschool years. we were probably 16-17 at this point, and it boggles my mind we thought this was okay? Like seriously I don\u2019t understand. We made a roleplay about a 10 year high school reunion. We made the characters as they were in high school, their basic personalities, what they planned to do with their lives, etc. And then the people playing the characters had to basically make them 10 years down the road, what had changed, etc. Which honestly, that was fine, in fact I still think that was interesting. It\u2019s nice to see where people take your characters.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. They WEREN\u2019T characters. We based them all ON OUR HIGH SCHOOL CLASS. Like, we changed the names obviously, we weren\u2019t that bad, and we didn\u2019t tell anyone they were based on real people. I know I won\u2019t be able to find it anymore, but I\u2019m pretty sure that we stole their pictures from their Facebook pages so it was really, truly, their faces, with our condescending versions of their personalities attached on a public forum.\n\nAnd like. Wow. That is so *not* okay. Luckily it really didn\u2019t take off or last long but I have no idea how we thought that was fine. It was mostly my best friend\u2019s idea and she was driving it, but I definitely helped and that\u2019s. . . Bad.",

And the girl I was roleplaying with, let's call her Rachel, was a demon that was Antisepticeye's sister/lover that cheated on him with Darkiplier but it was abusive and crazy and she became this god modded character. And grew cat ears and a tail. And somehow our characters meet and interact and immediately canoodle. Then she like killed my other characters that interacted with me because she loved Phil so much, ya know, so he can't speak to anyone else and he was like \"I mean pussy soo... Okay.\" And this roleplay went on for months and I can't stop thinking about it. We became mermaids at one point. Plot was nonexistent. Thinking back makes me not miss who I used to be. \n\nAlso, keep in mind, I started as a 13 y/o introvert who stumbled into it tryna troll my friend as a fictional character on social media. Then more added me and I just dove right in and ended up not trolling my friend (I wasn't gonna be mean, I was just wanting to comment weird stuff like \"show me dem feet and shit).\n\nI hate 13 y/o me.",

            "body": "Regarding OP's first one, I have a kinda funny story.   \n\n\nI got banned from neopets because of the RP forums. At one point, the forums just devolved so all the RPs available were \"Wolf RP M8ing Season\" and \"Lion RP M8ing Season.\" It was all that wolfaboo stuff, very furry centric.   \n  At the time, I was one of those little girls who was *obsessed* with unicorns. Like, I would call it something almost like a religion, the way I researched them and read about them and decorated my room with them. I was one of those types, yup. The thing I loved about unicorns was that they were the epitome of purity and innocence.   \n\n\nOne day, I saw someone had made a \"Unicorn RP **M8ing Season**\" and I just saw red. I went in there and filled 10 post boxes to the character limit ranting about how not only physically impossible it was to have a mating season with unicorns because ...they don't mate? Idk they are born from loveliness and child laughter. I was young, don't ask me to explain that logic. The point is I went off. Once I was done explaining how a mating season wouldn't happen with the embodiment of innocence, I started on the \"how dare you,\" calling them all perverts, saying they all deserved to die for the mortal sin they had just committed.   \n\n\nAnd as I was typing up my 11th box, I was met with an account ban. Thus ending the reign of my 10-year-old, had-it-since-beta-neopets account. To probably no surprise whatsoever, my username was **UnicWarrior**, and yes, when I transitioned to AOL, I did get shit on a lot and called a Eunuch. ~~An eunuch? Feel weird.~~",

            "body": "I love this post. I started in '99 on a board called Nothing But Neopets, so it sounds like we were roleplaying during the same era and making a lot of similar mistakes. (Also, obv a Monster Rancher fan here, too!)\n\n**01. I introduced myself as a furry.**\n\nI had no idea what a furry was, or an anthro. But I was playing anthros, because I loved animals and had seen other bipedal (but suspiciously sexy) animals wandering around. Eventually I saw people calling them furries, so I started to introduce myself as a furry because I wrote them. I was not a furry.\n\n(No hate toward furries, btw; I am cool with them. This bad is just a kid being ignorant.)\n\n**02. Constantly interrupted other people's RPs.**\n\nI guess at age 11 I could not understand how other people's ERP or heavily romantic scenes were *fun*, so I was always trying to \"spice them up\" with my weird furry characters. They'd just appear nearby and start investigating, and I was always left scratching my head over why I was kicked out of the channel/room after. \n\n**03. Lied about my age.**\n\nOnce I was 12-13, I could write just well enough to pass for someone a little older. All my RP friends were in their mid to late teens, so I was 17. This led to a lot of ERP I did ***not*** want to do, but played along with because I didn't want anyone to know I was a little kid.\n\nI deeply regret this one, because now that I'm over 30, I would be furious to learn someone I was writing with had lied about their age to me (and was under 21).\n\n**04. His left poot.**\n\nWhen I was 15/16, I was obsessed with writing beautiful male characters. (I still write 99.9% dudes as mains, but they're allowed to be icky, now.) I tried to write that a character snuffed his cigarette under his left boot, but typed \"poot,\" and was so deeply chagrined I wiped said character from the face of the Internet and never wrote him again. Sorry, dude.\n\n**05. The purple prose.**\n\nAround 16/17, I thought longer words = smarter posts. I would write with the thesaurus open in the other tab -- which, hey. I still use it a lot to find words that work better -- and would substitute every common word with something long and eloquent that no one ever says anymore. And if I could have said \"on,\" it was \"upon,\" etc. This is the biggest cringe for me, personally, because I still have some of this writing saved, and it is *atrocious*.\n\n**06. Selfish RPer.**\n\nThis is more recent, and I think about it a lot. In my early 20s, my writing had significantly improved. I enjoy looking back at it! What makes me cringe is how little regard I had for my fellow RPers. (Group RPs.) I've never been one to play the main character type, but I clearly cared more about showing off my characters' personalities than giving others something to respond to. I didn't facilitate dynamics that were fun, either, and one person in the group was too nice and timid to say anything about it. I bet she was not having as good a time as I assumed she was back then.\n\n**07. Bad communicator.**\n\nI can think of two scenarios where my shitty conflict resolution skills lost me RP partners. One was someone I really enjoyed writing with. Instead of being flexible, I stood my ground, and now I see that I all I had to do was be able to back down and compromise, and retcon something I had decided (mutually with a few others) in her unannounced absence/hiatus.",

To be honest I\u2019d totally forgot about that roleplay (it\u2019s been over 10 years, I am 28 now). I might make a post about it now that I am thinking about it, because yeah, it\u2019s bad. \n\nOh, and on the demands front. . . It was a thing for a while that you included something in the rules that people had to tell you when they messaged you so you know they read them. \n\n(Side note: that\u2019s one of my pet peeves now. I get it, you want to know people read things, but I find with 1 on 1s that you can usually tell based on what someone bothers to message you. I understand if the person is a teenager but when they\u2019re a grown adult expecting me, another grown adult, to message them something specific hidden in the middle of their post like an Easter egg it just slightly annoys me. Not enough to not message someone I think is a good match, though.)\n\nAnyway. When I was a teenager I took this to the extreme. Hidden in the rules of one of my roleplays were rules like \u201crule 3: title your message the word \u2018purple\u2019\u201d and then \u201crule 6: don\u2019t follow rule 3, follow rule 7 instead\u201d and then \u201crule 7: go back 3 rules and title the message the fourth word of that rule\u201d.\n\nIt was a god-damn logic puzzle to enter my roleplay. I thought it was clever. It was not.",

From what I can recall, I started roleplaying on Roblox (5-ish years ago, was around 12/13) with a few online friends I made in this \"roleplay\" game. Then I transition into this weirdass dragon game (still on roblox), this was the progression from 2 liners + dialogue, to a long paragraph. I think I was a decent writer then since no one ever complained about me doing or saying weird shit in the group chat we had (on discord). But I'll never really know. Oh, also experienced dragon ERP then, it wasn't necessarily bad since I already knew about it but it was kinda gross thinking back on it.",

Elfquest involved a bunch of elves riding around on wolves, living in little tribes in the woods, so I created this loner elf character and her wolf-pup who happened to wander across a tribe. On MUSHes, you could create \"puppets,\" like other characters that you could operate, so I made one for my wolf-pup, and I seemed to have way more fun just making him wander around, sniffing things and peeing on them. But at one point, I forgot to include the command to operate my puppet, so suddenly my elf-character, in the middle of a scene, \"squats on the ground and makes a puddle.\"\n\nI was mortified at the time, but it still makes me laugh.",

It's also great that you obliviously labelled yourself a furry xD\n\nAbout the more recent ones like selfish rp and communication, I think with these it just takes so much more time to get good at them. Negotiation, compromise vs firmness, confrontation vs passivity...you need to be interacting with different people over time to work out a decent way to handle all the different situations than more obvious stuff like \"don't photobomb someone's smut with your furry\". \n\nIt's something I try to keep in mind when I occasionally read posts that make me go \"???\", but then I have to think, *yeeeeah I remember doing stuff just like that, and worse...*",

            "body": "My first couple years of RP were a mess. I also just sucked at writing when I first started. Some memorable things:\n\n1. One-liner RPs where I would sometimes only reply with \"...\" or even just an emoticon like T_T or xD as my character's response. I also went through that phase where I heavily overused ellipses.\n\n2. You know that roleplayer whose character is always depressed and edgy and does nothing but whine for attention and talk about how horrible and lonely their life is, but also always pulls away when a character actually approaches them, thus making any interaction a pain? Yup, that was me for a while. I'd also do things like write my character sitting alone in their locked bedroom and then get upset when no one replied. I was a very insecure RPer at the time and I made it everyone's business. I cringe every time I think back on it.\n\n3. Wrote m/m smut while having no idea how anal sex worked. Thought a little spit would be enough. Sometimes the characters wouldn't use anything at all. Ouch. **To make this infinitely worse:** because I didn't know what m/m sex looked like, I would save gay porn gifs I found on tumblr *onto my family's computer* for inspiration. All of my family members had separate accounts and document folders, but everything was visible to everyone and to this day I have no idea if anyone ever snooped and found these gifs or not. I also had some of my smut RP saved on a Word document.\n\n4. Ooc bleeding into ic. I definitely had times where I let how I was feeling ooc influence how my character behaved. The worst was when I made my character cheat on their significant other, because I just found out my partner planned to kill off their character (my character's S.O.) and leave the group, and that they had it planned for weeks but lied about it. Another character had been fancying mine a while but they never reciprocated because they were happily taken, but when I got this news I was so upset I just let my character sleep with them because their S.O. was going to be dead the very next day anyway.\n\n5. Bad communication. I'm better at it now but I used to suck at communicating. So many times I let my frustration fester instead of letting my partners know something was bothering me. I once had a partner who was also like this, and it ended in a huge falling out after like four years of roleplaying together. Just years of crap we were mad about all coming out at once. It was a mess and I vowed to never let that happen again.",

            "body": "oh jesus, I started out roleplaying in a game called FeralHeart, which is probably bad enough already. Things spiraled from there. \n\n\\----\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nMy first few characters were unkillable, god-modding demons that would go around public areas and \"\\*kills, no dodge\\*\" random people just trying to have a good time. These characters of mine also cried tears of blood.\n\n**Yikes**\n\nUhhhh, man, there's so much more. \n\nI vividly remember my first 'mapped' RP in FeralHeart, which is more private with a custom map built by the RP's admins. I'd learned how to RP using full sentences around this time, which meant I was suddenly 'literate' by the community's standards. \n\nMy wolf OC was named Dagger (LMAO), and for some reason she was able to become one of the alphas in this group. No clue why. Got into a lot of weird political debates with other children in that group, too. Mind you, I was on the wrong side of those debates. We're talking about my edgy years.\n\n**Furry Subterfuge** [(fitting tune)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLp_Hh6DKWc&amp;ab_channel=DarwinsLilGirl)\n\nGradually I moved on to making my own maps, publishing my own Wix websites for my RP groups, all decked out with strict rules, guides, forums, and teams of mods. \n\nIt all started when I was getting more and more confident in my writing, then thought I could do things WAY better than the admins running groups I was currently part of.\n\nThere was this post-apocalyptic zombie dog RP with a custom map (I avoided public maps by this point) and I guess I just thought my ideas about murderous Scandinavian wolves were way better. I rounded up all the friends I'd made in that group, created my OWN group along with a fresh snowy mountain map, promoted those friends to become my new moderators, and basically stole the zombie dog RP's entire roster over the next few weeks.\n\nThe zombie dog RP admins retaliated, and we had a month-long feud because of my crimes.\n\nBut I grew the group anyway, made more friends and enemies, and developed a ridiculous god complex from it all. Things turned very elitist. I became an unhinged 13 y.o. who abused \"xD\" and was addicted to FeralHeart wolf pack RPs until the game itself became irrelevant.\n\n...\n\nIt's been almost 10 years since then and sometimes I wish I was still in contact with the people I met during that time, just to talk about how batshit insane that whole era of our childhood was.\n\nOverall, FeralHeart drama ate up about 4 to 5 years of my teenage years.\n\nAfter that, I discovered the magic of 1v1 Google Docs RP with someone I'd been on really good terms with throughout my manic FeralHeart wolf dictatorships, and stuck with them for 6 years. That's a whole other story. The shit we wrote deserves to be locked away and forgotten. \n\nBeen into the 1v1 format ever since.",

It's insane how the tiniest amount of power goes straight to the head of a kid with nothing else to do lol. \n\nHigh five for the teenage god complex and associated drama.\n\nTBH I didn't include it all in my post because it's almost its own entire post, but as a very brief summary:  \nGetting into arguments with the players when I had misunderstood them, doubling down when I knew I was wrong, attempting to save face, failing.\n\nGoing through an incredibly /r/im14andthisisdeep atheism-realisation phase and getting into some very ill-advised \"debates\" in the forum chat. I was messy and rude AF. \n\nHad an associated i'M jUsT hOnEsT aNd sArCaStIc period of time. I definitely felt like the baddest bitch, until I realised I was just being a bitch because I was sad at that time, lol.\n\nThat's not to say there wasn't a lot of awesome stuff happening as well; we deeply loved our lore and talking with each other every day despite the occasional blowout. The good news is, much like with your situation, that all passed and we all remain friends. Thankfully they accepted my apologies. \n\nIt's kind of cool to have lived through it together, and as a group to look back occasionally and go \"oh that was...something.\"",
