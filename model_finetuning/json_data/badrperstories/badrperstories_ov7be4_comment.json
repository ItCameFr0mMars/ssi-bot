            "body": "I leave a community for one of two reasons. One, I'm no longer enjoying my plots or I couldn't get the ball rolling in the first place. Two, I don't think the memberbase (staff or not) are treating people fairly. I can overlook a lot, but those are the two most important things for me. \n\nNot everyone needs to be friends in a group. There will always be people that don't interact much or don't like each other. It's a normal part of any group dynamic, imo. But it takes very little effort to handle those situations like a mature adult instead of what's happening here. \n\nStaff being this petty and passive-aggressive isn't a good look regardless of whether you're personally affected by it. If they can't address whatever problem they have with a member, then the right course of action is to ask them to leave, not to act like a high school mean girl. Or at the very least, just not interact with that member outside official staff matters. \n\nMove on. It's what's best for you, even if the leaving itself might be painful. I'd recommend reaching out to the players of the plots you're enjoying and asking if they'd like to continue them elsewhere, maybe on a private forum or a 1x1 Discord server.",

I've been an admin in a group rp. I was an admin for an rp that ran on Tumblr/discord for 5+ years. We recently closed it at a high point.
