But in retrospect (this screenshot is pretty old), I kinda wish I did report.  \n(also I might be outing myself if I reported this PM in particular, since in my own reply I said I didn't have any limits, which that wording is against ToS as well unfortunately)\n\nAnd yeahhhh, no, not fitting for her at all. Although it just seems like this guys views on young women is that they are all \"awe\" induced by the thought of dick. All of them are just these young women (or girls actually), just like \"omg how to get dick???\" smh\n\nAlso a side note: he also ignored my segment in my ad that I know for sure said: \"I will not play canon characters.\" Including Disney themes. For Disney I was pretty straight forward about using Disney plots as an outline for Fairytales and OC interpretations of the characters. Clearly, he ignored that.",

I'm actually always shocked at this point when I see a teenager advertising and that's only been once or twice.\n\nLegit, I think a lot of people just don't know where else to go. Haha. I've had this discussion with partners before and a lot of them say they aren't sure how to find other sites or they're all sites that seem to be more for ERP so they just keep heading back home, which same. I only advertise on there and Reddit. Writing on the site above is legit hell at this point, so I always move over to Gdocs and Discord too.\n\nI have written minors in legacy type role plays and it's always fine but there's never anything sexual with those characters because they're MINORS.\n\nI have come across one but I didn't realize what it was. They said they wanted darker plots and taboo stuff like age gaps. I'm a huge fan of adult age gaps and darker plots so I messaged them and then found out she wanted underage characters (and some other unsavory shit) and when I said I didn't do that she got annoyed with me and blocked me on discord like I wasted her time or something. Haha. I haven't seen her on the site since so I think someone else reported her because I know a lot of people aren't down with that, just by discussing limits and bad role player stories with other partners.\n\nAre there even still admins actively watching posts at this point? I know they'll still delete reported posts because it happened to someone I know recently. I think most people just skirt it with \"My limits are your limits. :) We can discuss on Discord.\" Which could fall under violence and things that are allowed on the site so they don't touch them.",

Legit a few weeks ago. I think I even went on there one time asking if anyone had any suggestions; nope! Which was disappointing, because the site has definitely lost its traffic over the years.\n\nActually I only discovered there being an RP scene on reddit like... Super recently. And that's only because I hoped onto reddit recently for other reasons, and was curious so did a search for roleplay options. I've yet to start up anything with anyone here yet, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I've got another option once I'm ready to partner hunt again.\n\nAaaaand yeah, whenever you're advertising that you like dark, or taboo topics, you can get some fucking unsavory people hitting you up. Which sucks. But, then it works out whenever I find people that *aren't* creeps, but aren't afraid to dive into dark subject matter. And thankfully whenever MOST people want to get into subject or plots involving 'teens', they're usually pretty set on it being \"18-19\" if we're going into certain territories. \n\nI can't say I know how active the admins even are on the site these days. I bounce on just long enough to find a few long term partners, then I'm gone lol. But that's 100% on \"My limits on your limits, onward to discord\" lmao",
