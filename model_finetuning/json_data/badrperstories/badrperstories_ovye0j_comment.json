I already read multiple stories about people who tried to contact their partner on other plattforms after they were blocked on one, for example on whatsapp when they were already blocked on discord and so on. \n\n\\-don't let anyone tell you that leaving without providing a detailed list of what exactly they did wrong is 'ghosting'. It is not ghosting if you tell them that you leave and end the roleplay, and it is not bad roleplaying behavior even if you don't describe why you leave in great detail. A simple explanation is totally fine, don't feel bad about it.\n\n\\-If they are very rude to you in their messages, take a screenshot of this and safe it somewhere on your computer. It might become relevant when you notice that they talk behind your back, as you can use it as proof that you did nothing wrong and they mistreated you.\n\n\\-try to stay polite even if they are rude to you. I know that this can be hard, but don't call them a bitch and so on, as this could be used as proof by them that you were the bad roleplayer.",

It's just a chance for them to renegotiate or make a point or \"you can't fire me I quit\".",
