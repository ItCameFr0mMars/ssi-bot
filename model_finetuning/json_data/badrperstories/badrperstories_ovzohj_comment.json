Or maybe ask about where this came from?\n\n\"Hey, I didn't think that this was the type of setting that would call for something like this?\" \n\nI would *definitely* think that the inclusion of superhero abilities without any prior acknowledgement of such would need to be discussed. Because I'd be thrown off too. \n\nOr maybe something along the lines of, \"I'm not sure I'm a fan of the direction of bringing in superhuman abilities into this.\" \n\nHopefully you can work it out. I can't say I've had something close to this exact scenario happening with myself, but I've had long term partners that we discussed and fixed discrepancies in the story whenever they pop up. Hopefully your partner will be understanding.",
