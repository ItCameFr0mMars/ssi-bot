It happens a bit with people that are less than stellar or have things they're working through and don't want to acknowledge as negative traits; it manifests as jealousy and annoyance because you are what they aren't and want to be but can't, so they grow uncomfortable and try to run away. Like a shadow fleeing the light of a campfire.\n\nI don't think you didn't anything wrong, you just weren't compatible with them in terms of personality in the long term. If anything, I'd say they're ungrateful, but more likely they're used to everyone being negative in some way and eventually weighing them down so they left before the happy balloon popped and sent them falling further than they anticipated",

Because either they didn't have the guts to just say they aren't interested any more (I know this is hard, it costs me a lot to overcome this 'and what if...' kind of thinking as well) OR they are not mature enough to understand that all people have and experience all kinds of emotions. You even offered to cut the OOC to a minimum (I guess planning would still be involved) what is, if somebody tells you that they 'can't handle you' (like wtf?) in my opinion is very generous, I would just have said \"okay, bye then \\[insert insult\\]\". Anyway I am sorry you have to experience this because this is worse than most other reasons I have seen people quitting. Like this is a personal attack on a lowest level and super pathetic. I hope you find another great partner who treats you the with the respect you deserve. Remember, you are just as valid and wrth of love like all of us are. Take this digital hug if you want to.",

That was in the context of stuff like parting ways not so amicably though, not the day to day.\n\nHonestly?  I don't think those even apply, I think they're just extremely poor at saying 'this isnt a personality fit'.  \"i dont think i can handle you as a person anymore lol\" = yikes, also they couldn't communicate an issue before it got to this point.  I will say that \"oh but I could stop talking ooc to Make It Work\" doesn't work because this person had already made their decision to leave so no amount of patch-up was gonna make that work.\n\nI dunno, like you could look into toxic positivity to see if that was in play here in retrospect but I doubt it.  They reneged from 'not that youre annoying to anything' to 'its driving me crazy' then 'please stop' when they were already leaving in the first place, I think this was just a dumb kid who can't communicate or navigate grey areas like \"nobody is the bad guy but this isn't working for me\".",
