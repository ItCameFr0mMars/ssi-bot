            "body": "If someone is accusing someone of ghosting after 2 days, that sounds like a *them* problem. Jeez. \n\nFor me, I assume ghosting after anywhere from... 2 weeks to a month. Somewhere in that time I *may* do a check up. But even if I am ghosted, I won't call them out on it. My order of operations is usually:\n\n\\-Wait around. If after a few weeks to a month, I get no update, I MAY ask for an interest check. If I send out an inquiry and get no response from that -&gt; After 48 hours, I'll solidly assume I'm ghosted, then I'll delete or leave the server I'm in.\n\n\\-If I never send an interest check, I may just let the server sit around for months and months. Eventually I may leave a server after several months.\n\nI try not to be an ass, honestly. Even if I'm clearly being ghosted. Actually, recently I've had TWO partners who have ghosted me get in contact with me asking if I wanted to pick up the roleplay again. I'm like, sure, yeah. Why not? Sometimes life happens. \n\nI honestly think sometimes people don't *mean* to ghost, even after long periods of time. Sometimes life just gets crazy, but that interest in the roleplay is still there. Hence the people who have wanted to continue after a year of silence. Of the two people who contacted me recently, one has since ghosted me again (I'm not mad at all), and the other we've got the roleplay going stronger than it had a year ago.",

Each day, after posting the starter they would spam me with messages like \u201cAre we going to rp?\u201d \u201cAre you finished yet?\u201d and so on, I kept telling them yes. But this behaviour was steadily turning me off from writing with them. Especially when I tell people from the jump if you're looking for someone who can reply at warp speed please don't contact me. I am not the fastest writer due to my health and other responsibilities. They didn't care. By the third day, they started going off on me, prompting me to say I didn't think we were compatible due to their constant poking which they said was warranted. Even when I told them I was going through a flare-up with my health, they didn't care and acted pretty cold. Safe to say we\u2019re no longer partners, but I have been in this situation numerous times where I was accused of ghosting when in reality I was either working on the reply, got sick, or real-life got the better of me.

            "body": "I agree with so many sentiments in this post except for the expectation that your writing partner should be the one to remind you to reply. It's your responsibility to keep up your side of the roleplay, asking your writing partner for reminders because you forgot is really crappy and I've ended roleplays when people have asked me to do this because to me. It signals a lack of investment.\u00a0\n\nThere's obviously a difference between extenuating circumstances making you forget and then routinely forgetting and having to be reminded. There's also a difference between checking in (after a reasonable time) and being asked to remind someone to reply to you.\u00a0\n\nI'm a working professional with a career and a full life outside of writing and I also happen to have 10 writing partners. I don't do rapid-fire style roleplay and can take up to a week to reply, but I never forget and I usually give my writing partners a head's up before they even have to check in. I'm not some super human with a crazy memory, I am just organized. I keep a running list of the replies I receive and the date I received it in a gmail draft and that way when I have time to sit down and write I can look at all of the replies I owe and get to work on them.\u00a0\n\nPeople seem to forget that any sort of relationship takes good communication to work, including writing partners. I try to lead by example and be super up front with what my writing partner can expect from me and just ask, not for the same in return, but to let me know what I can expect from them. If the expectation is that I need to remind you to reply because you will forget, then I'll politely pass on the roleplay and find someone else to write with.\u00a0\n\nAll that being said... You don't owe anyone anything. This is a mostly anonymous hobby and it's up to you to decide how you want to treat people in it. Just don't be surprised or upset if you're an uncommunicative writing partner and get ghosted or someone ends your roleplay. And on the other side if you're a needy, pushy, obsessive writing partner who can't be patient or understanding then don't be surprised or upset when you get ghosted or someone ends your roleplay.\u00a0",

But as an adult, I expect my scene partners to be able to keep track of their own posts and stories. It shouldn't be my job to nudge or poke or remind someone else to write, and honestly I feel like a bother if I do that. Conversely, I'd be really annoyed if someone was poking me for that because it *is* a hobby and as an adult, I *do* keep tabs on what I owe and respond in a consistent fashion. If they forget, that's on them. I'm not here to be someone's manager.   \n\n\nSimilarly, as an adult, I always communicate if I'm going to be a while. If I'm online pinging posts back and forth, but I need to go for an extended period of time, I feel like it's rude to just suddenly walk away. It's like being in a conversation with someone and then just suddenly turning and leaving. A quick \"g2g\" or \"ttyl\" takes half a second for me to type and hit enter. If my partners usually know they get a post from me a few times a day or even once a day, but I see that I'm just too busy, or too exhausted, or just not in the mood to write for more than that, then it takes nothing - literally nothing - for me to open up the discord app the next time I go to take a morning dump and send a quick \"hey it's going to be a few days for me, sorry about the hold up, I'll be in touch\" so my partners *don't* think I've just lost interest or I'm ignoring them.   \n\n\nDo I owe them that? Not technically. Do they appreciate it? Yes.   \n\n\nYou're here preaching empathy, but are you giving it? Yes it's a hobby, but a little communication, literally the tiniest bit of communication, goes a long way and will save you from all of this.   \n\n\nConsideration goes both ways. Yeah, giving up and scrapping a story after two days is excessive, but by the time we reach adulthood, we should all be pretty aware of at least a baseline of communicating.",

Well it\u2019s not very nice, you never know the situation another person is in with their IRL. So if someone ghosts me I don\u2019t hold it against them, no one should be obligated to tell someone anything. So I support ghosting.",

We all have lives and roleplay is a hobby, indeed... but it's not supposed to feel like taking attendance, either.\n\nI personally never nudge. My philosophy is that if I'm forgotten, then the RP that was had with the other was *forgettable* \\- I mean, doesn't it logically follow? Inspiration, on the other hand, is one hell of a drug. So is excitement. Some books/TV shows, you'd reach the middle then forget about them. Others, you'd binge watch/read them from start to finish, or count the days until the next episode, etc.\n\nSame with RPs. Some are, \"not what I expected, but eh, whatever.\" Others are, \"oh *wow,* I can't wait until I have more of this/see what happens next!\"\n\nBtw I read your other replies and I get forgetfulness/imperfection completely. I definitely have my own flaws. But it sounds like a neat idea (in general, actually, hopefully it becomes a standard during introductions prior to RP) to request to be nudged if X days have passed + ask when it's okay to nudge the other.",
