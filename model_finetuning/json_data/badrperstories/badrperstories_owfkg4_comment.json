I think ghosting is unfavorable, but I don't think it's always \"bad\", or at the very least, not the worst thing ever.\n\nI've got a writing partner that I've had for three years now, and we OOC chat daily. If she ghosted me, I'd admittedly be very hurt and upset by it. But, we've got a long going thing going, and a legitimate friendship.\n\nBut say, if someone I've been corresponding with for just a week or two decides to ditch... Then I probably personally wouldn't be all too upset. Maybe their interest died out after the discussion phase, or maybe life happened. If it was a plot I was really excited for, I'd probably ask them what was up. Otherwise, I'll just move on and not worry about it.\n\nNow, if someone ghosts and *blocks* you with no warning... That is definitely super annoying. I've only ever done this to people who have given me legitimate reasons to be uncomfortable with them, so an auto-block with no warning is super uncalled for imo.\n\nA lot of the time, from personal experience, if I ghost it's unintentional. It's typically a matter of: life is being hectic, or I don't have the energy to write, and before I know it 1 week of no replies turns to 3. And, then I'm like \"Oh shit, well, it's been ages now so...\"   \nJust really depends. If I've built up a friendship with a person, I'll be much more likely to check in and be like, \"Hey sorry, it's been crazy\", or I'd give them updates as I go. Like I said, I've got partners I talk to on the daily, so if I'm unable to reply for some time, they already know about it.\n\nI don't think it's all black and white. I think the worst offender is the ghost n' block. Or if it's over discord, they just delete the server with no warning.",

            "body": "Maybe an unpopular opinion, but...\n\nAdmittedly, I have already accidently 'ghosted' people. Now you might think, how is that even possible? For example if I carry the whole weight in the planning phase, and all their answers are 'Yeah/ok/I guess' and never their own ideas or any follow up questions. When this happens, it can be hard for me to feel a connection to the roleplay or get really involved. Sometimes, these partners did not respond for weeks, and when I remembered that we were planning something together and clicked on the chat, I realized that I was the one who did not reply anything when they last wrote me 'ok'...whoops. But they always had the chance to contact me or add their own ideas/ask questions, and there seemed to very little interest in the roleplay on their part. So in the end, I don't think that this ghosting was that bad, they were probably relieved because they did not  have to continue or at least did not really care.\n\nI think one of the important parts that makes some forms of ghosting so bad is the lack of closure. If there was a very heated discussion beforehand, during the planning phase they constantly say stuff like 'let's do (things you have listed in your dislikes)' or they say something like 'hey, can we include (graphic scene voyeuristic scene of sexual assault, weird kink in a non-ERP)', ghosting might not be the most polite choice, but almost every roleplayer will get the reason why they got ghosted in that situation after thinking about it. The lack of closure isn't really there. In my opinion, it would be wrong to paint the ghoster as some kind of monster in that situation, and the other person as an angel who got wronged in a horrible way. It maybe wasn't the most polite way to handle it, but merely a reaction to having your dislikes constantly disregarded. In that situation, I would say 'The person knew why it happened, you weren't compatible any way, it was not the nicest way to go but nothing that would lead my to never roleplay with you because you are ghoster'.\n\nBut there is one thing that bothers me a little about your post, and because you asked for feedback, I will tell you. It can always happen that someone looses interest. Sadly, it is something that is very hard to predict. Sometimes, people really are super hyped and then realize, oh, I am not sure why, but my interest isn't there any more/this roleplay isn't what I expected it to be, I don't have many ideas. They might try to write regardless, but as you noticed, it won't work out. I totally get that this frustrating, but you shouldn't get mad at the person or see it as a personal insult. At least they told you what was wrong. Reacting with being angry will make it incredibly hard for your partners to communicate their issues.",

Trigger warning below!\n\nAn old partner of mine would go in depth about how she lost her virginity to herself and how no one would ever love her or willingly \u201ctake it\u201d away themselves. I was super uncomfortable. She would also force me into a situation where I would give her compliments and was also extremely clingy. Real incel vibes. I straight up ghosted her. \n\nAnother one gave me weird vibes. I sent her a couple of songs in the OOC chat and she flipped out (pretty sure there weren\u2019t even any explicits). She went off at me for like ten minutes straight how I was violating her privacy and other stuff that made me really confused and uncomfortable. She was also clingy and forced me into reply when I was busy etc. I \u201cweaned\u201d her off and just stopped replying after a while. \n\nI think there\u2019s a line. If you\u2019re simply uninterested and decide to \u201cghost\u201d people especially long time partners you\u2019re kinda a dick. When they reach creepy, toxic, or simply feel \u201coff\u201d I think it\u2019s fine to ghost them. I\u2019ve had people contact on me on other accounts when I\u2019ve tried ending it amiably before or get bombarded with threats or insults. It\u2019s kinda like dating, I guess lol.",

So, I feel like it'd be hypocritical of me not to be more lenient towards it. Especially if it's a reason such as loss of motivation or burnout (Which I have plenty of experience with). I'm a pretty patient person, and if I know they'll return at some point, it doesn't bother me. Plus I have my own ways to counteract burnout or disinterest to keep a roleplay afloat.\n\nThere are types of ghosters I'm admittedly more wary of such as those who get overly excited for a specific genre or fandom and overwhelm themselves with so many roleplays to the point they forget half of them. They'll do it repeatedly until they lose interest so there's no point in continuing with them from the way I see it.  \n\nI feel like most people *have* ghosted at some point in their roleplay careers, but they justify it by calling it something else like \"soft blocking\" or \"forgetting\" etc. Nobody wants to be a ghoster, but everybody loves to complain about how everybody else is ghosting.",

            "body": "I would argue that the first example isn't actually ghosting.   \n\n\nGhosting is when someone just deletes, blocks, vanishes without a trace and without an explanation. In example one, they gave an explanation that justified you leaving. They saw you do it. That's leaving, not ghosting.   \n\n\nExample two, however, where they left while you were asleep and deleted everything, said nothing to you (I'm assuming that was a typo, but they might have said mother to you, no judgement) - that is ghosting.   \n\n\nAnd no, in general, I don't think ghosting is ever ok. You can tell someone straight up, \"I'm not interested anymore,\" and then block them and leave. It's shitty, but you gave a reason, told them you wouldn't be continuing, and then left. Not ghosting.   \n\n\nThe reason *ghosting*, genuine ghosting, is bad is that it leaves the other person not knowing what went wrong. Did you die? Did your account get hacked? Did they do something to piss you off? Did they cross a boundary without meaning to? All they're left with are questions, and because RP is such a personal hobby, those questions can often get internalized into a narrative of \"They didn't like me. My writing is awful. I should give up. I'm a terrible person.\"   \n\n\nFor me, I assume that every role player I meet has BPD, Depression, Anxiety, or any other mental health disorder. It's a hobby about escapism. That's the main thing most people want to escape. Knowing that, I would never even consider just leaving without a trace to make people wonder why, and my reason for leaving will be as constructive and diplomatic as possible, because there's no need for me to be mean or cruel to someone else. We're all writers trying to find our stories. It takes me maybe twenty seconds for me to type out a quick \"I'm sorry, I just don't feel like this is the story for me, but I genuinely wish you all the best.\"   \n\n\nSo the issue overall is that most people don't understand what \"ghosting\" actually is and they just assume it means ending a story prematurely. That on its own is no big deal. Plenty of other fish in the sea. It's when someone just disappears without a trace or a clue as to what happened that it becomes toxic, and really the only reason I could see behind it is cowardice and poor communication.",

            "body": "I think that there is another reason why ghosting is bad. Not only do you not know if maybe something happened to them, or wonder if your writing was bad...it also robs you of the possibility to explain yourself. \n\nSometimes, you can somewhat guess which problem might have lead to them ghosting. For example, let's say we have roleplayed for multiple month now, and are having plenty of nice chats OOC. We had a discussion about post frequency, I said sometimes I am away for one week, you agree and say it doesn't bother you. After a while, I write you a message saying 'Heyah, I will be away because of (reason) for two weeks.' When I come back, I am blocked, the server is deleted, and my message has never been replied to. Of course I deep down know that this was because of my absence, and you probably left because you couldn't handle the roleplay progressing so slowly. I know that you are not dead, it was most likely not due to my writing in general, etc.\n\nBut this can still can produce very negative thoughts, for example 'Was all the being nice just an act? They did not even feel the need to inform me.' or 'Did they get the impression that I am a horrible, unreasonable person who would go off on them when they tell me that they want to leave, is that the impression other people get when they write with me?' and so on. \n\nOf course, this only applies to roleplays which have lasted a longer period of time, not when for example in the planning phase, we talk about post frequencies, I tell you how often I write and you block me.",

            "body": "&gt;The reason ghosting, genuine ghosting, is bad is that it leaves the other person not knowing what went wrong. Did you die? Did your account get hacked? Did they do something to piss you off? Did they cross a boundary without meaning to? All they're left with are questions, and because RP is such a personal hobby, those questions can often get internalized into a narrative of \"They didn't like me. My writing is awful. I should give up. I'm a terrible person.\"  \n\n\nI often wonder what i did wrong too when someone ghosts me, then when i figure out they blocked me or just instantly ghosted and left, i then quickly realize its not my fault and that it is instead either their fault, or they just ghosted cuz they felt like it or i wouldn't do their fantasies or whatever they wanted, leaves me feeling annoyed and quite often my rp mood gets soured in the process.",

I haven't roleplayed much at all with people of reddit of yet, so maybe it's more frequent here. But it's definitely not a nice feeling. \n\nI can't comment much on the canon x oc thing though, because I've never engaged in canon characters in roleplay. But I guess all I can say is, if they only want you to play a canon character and you don't want to... Just politely tell them you're not interested. If they block you for it, then I guess whatever at that point, because it's obvious you're not going to be a match anyway.\n\nIf you're blocked and have absolutely NO CLUE why... Then, yeah, that sucks. And you can't even ask what's up because you're blocked.",
