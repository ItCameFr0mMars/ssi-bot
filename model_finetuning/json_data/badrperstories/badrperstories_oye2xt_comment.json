I'm autistic, I don't buy this, it also feels like they brought up their issues to make you feel bad so that you'd stop asking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And here's the rub for me, they also mentioned that this time they decided to ghost me due to the fact I'm a private person.\n\n...yeah, were they expecting a person they yo-yo'ed, neglected and dropped when it was convenient to not be 'private'?  What effort did they put in to net the intimacy?  They want to be casual and dip whenever but want you to be more personal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Oof so I feel like an massive dick for that part too, as maybe I should've taken a different approach\n\nNah I think you feel bad because calling someone on it who goes \"oh sorry I had Mental Issues, also I ghosted because of a thing *you* did towards the end\" is mindfuckery.\n\n&gt;But I'm still going to feel like a massive asshole for dumping someone who seems to have genuinely changed for the better\n\nI don't buy it personally.  At its most generous, eight *years* is a long time to establish a sustained habit and even after doing the work they're kind of just... \"oh yeah I did the thing because I was oblivious and/or sad\" in a way that made you feel too guilty to hold them accountable.  Those issues are still there so what happens the next time they're sad and don't feel like it?  Are they going to do the work or relapse into eight friggin' years of patterns?  What has their interpersonal work looked like beyond 'oh i know there is an issue igues'?  If you didn't bring up you were tired of the ghosting what would they have done?  Do your breakup letter if only to set the example then block is where I'm at with it personally, they need to learn neglect has tangible consequences.\n\nEven if they did everything right in the aftermath you get to decide that eight years of on/off neglect was the last straw, years ago even.  They're not owed forgiveness or your time and personally I feel you'd struggle to hold them accountable, not saying that to be mean but it's been eight years of struggling to do that and them just checking out.",

            "body": "Nope. I don't buy that someone pulled this for eight years and had no idea that it wasn't okay. When they've done something for that long, it's become an established part of their behaviour. Ghosting is probably the peeve that I see the most complaining about in the roleplay community, so I highly doubt they were unaware that it's frowned upon. Even if they're completely isolated from other roleplayers, it's a no-brainer to realize that that kind of on-and-off behaviour is a dick move.\n\nOr if you really do want to believe they had no idea... then that's what you're going to deal with going forward. Someone who is completely 100% oblivious to what is and isn't acceptable and needs to be guided into acting with basic decency and consideration. That's an unreasonable burden on you unless you're getting paid for it. A change like that is going to take months if not years.\n\nFrom here, I can only see this situation getting worse. They've treated you like shit and it sounds like they didn't even apologize or say it wouldn't happen again, just put the blame on their mental health. That's an explanation, not an excuse. You don't just go 'oh well I have autism, so whoops'. You say you're sorry and you were wrong. Because you hurt someone, extensively and repeatedly in this case, and you need to own up to that in no uncertain terms.\n\nSo it's time to leave. Ghosting is a dick move, especially considering how much their ghosting hurt you. I don't know if I'd go with a whole 'breakup letter' like you said. Sure, you guys have known each other for a long time (I hesitate to use the word 'friends' given their treatment of you). That doesn't mean you owe them anything. They certainly haven't felt that way! \n\nI would write something short and succinct explaining that you appreciate their explanation but you feel it's best to part ways. You already confronted them about the issues you had and presumably explained how their behaviour affected you. They know what you had a problem with. At this point I think it's best to give them a goodbye message but spend as little time as possible on this person.\n\nI would also preemptively block them on all platforms you share after you send it. They've decisively shown that they don't give a shit about your feelings. They've also stated themselves that they either were or are in a hyperaggressive state. That's a recipe for disaster and frankly you've dealt with too much from them already.\n\n(Edit: typo)",

In fact, I still struggle to hold my previous rp partner before them accountable and they've even done much more severe things to me than this rp partner (and it's been almost 10 yrs since I last said a word to that person). I mean I feel like you're stating pretty much a fact that's pretty obvious, so I can tell you're not coming from a harsh or mean place.\n\nThe mindfuckery doesn't exactly help, as I already don't trust my view on the entire situation. My own brain already messes with me on the daily for nearly everything, so I can't always tell; maybe I'm being a humongous dick, maybe my feelings are reasonable. I mean I didn't expect them to provide me with anything beyond some rp fun or a goodbye if they needed to dip out again; but maybe I did something wrong by expecting that.\n\nI only knew juuuuust enough to know something was wrong with the situation. Was it me causing the problems? Was it them? I literally and honestly couldn't tell what was wrong until I posted about it here and had multiple people tell me this person's been the massive dick.\n\nThen there's the fact their behavior is starting to remind me of my past rp partner I've had a violent relationship with, now that I've actually called them out. I'm already seeing red flags and I don't feel like repeating those violent experiences; regardless of my tendency to set myself on fire to keep others warm. I've already dealt with a past rp partner who claimed to be medicated, yet absolutely acted like an asshole; I don't feel like repeating that episode.\n\nSo regardless of what my nagging heart says, I'm still going to dump them after I say my final piece.",

It's taken a lot of people I've seen a lot of time to change that greatly.\n\nAnd considering they mentioned that they supposedly improved in even less time than I thought? After 8 years of the same thing happening over and over again, I'm just too tired to try again on the off chance maybe they've truly changed in roughly 4 months. I was already reluctant when I thought they've improved themselves around the same time they ditched me about 8 months ago. I just don't feel like 4 months is enough time for someone to change 8 years worth of the same behavior. If they came back a few years later and told me they've been working on improving themselves and fixing their mistakes since they last left? Then I'd probably be more inclined to really believe they've changed.\n\nBut otherwise have no doubts, I do plan on dumping them despite my excessive guilt complex over the situation. Especially since I'm not interested in actually becoming more friendly with them and being subjected to what happens when something goes wrong in their life. It's already taken me a long time to get to the point where I am and I'm lucky if I can still keep my shit together most days; the last thing I need is to purposely invite someone who will undo everything I've worked towards for years. \n\nOtherwise I just figured on the 'breakup letter' as I do have quite a few more grievances I would like to nip in the bud; especially as their 'apology' does bug me quite a lot for quite a lot of reasons.
