After looking at his post history on Reddit... let's just say it was obvious prose this good didn't come from a person who spammed \"hey wanna rp\" on every prompt he came across.  So I googled a chunk of the text and immediately found it on the Destiny 2 wiki.\n\nI had this conversation with him purely because I was curious what his end goal was, but as you can see he refused to break character and wouldn't answer me.\n\nThe most hilarious thing though?  This guy is a frequent poster on this sub.  I see him here bitching all the time about being ghosted/having people end RPs with him.  Since I know you're reading this, hi friend! :)  Maybe some self reflection will help you understand why no one wants to RP with you.",

Busted!\n\nOne time on a roleplay forum, someone had their samples posted on their search thread, and one of the samples was word for word just the opening to The Last Unicorn (the novel). Like I read it was like... Wait? I *know* this. I've read this before, many times...\n\nSure enough, I copied and pasted their sample into google, and the opening chapter for The Last Unicorn came up.\n\nI wish so so bad I called them out on it, but since they hadn't messaged me directly and it was just their open samples, I opted not to. But damn, I wish I did. One of my favorite books. It'd be one thing if they advertised they wanted to do a roleplay involving the book itself, but they legit just had it listed as a writing sample. I wonder how many of her other samples were plagiarized.",

It ain't hard to believe, yo.\n\nThe quality on this sub has taken a nosedive in recent months.  Half the time when I read between the lines its apparent that the situations people are complaining about are their own fault, at least in part.  Looking at their post history usually confirms that.\n\nThe other half of the posts here are from wet blankets saying things like \"This guy asked for my real photo and then forced me to voice chat every night.  Do you think I should end the RP?\"  \n\nI suspect this is due to an influx of younger people getting into the hobby, but it's getting ridiculous.",

Maybe I'm just a crotchety old person lol but I definitely get the vibe that there are a lot of younger people about. Younger than what I'm used to.
