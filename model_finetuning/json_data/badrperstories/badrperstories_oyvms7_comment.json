But with age also comes things like jobs/responsibilities/adulty things. \n\nMy assumption as an almost 30 year old who with age, does not have the same posting stamina as I used to, and most of my partners are close to my age (or older than me), and also are not able to post as much?\n\nAnother factor goes into length, but I don't think length = skilled, or vise versa... But majority of my more skilled partners are long form writers, which takes more time to write and get down a nice reply? While typically whenever I delve into things with partners who reply shorter, yet quicker replies, I typically feel in these experiences these partners aren't as skilled? &lt;--- Take this one with a big ol' heaping grain of salt, because this is not a golden rule at all. I've had great partners who were awesome writers who were short form writers, and then I've had duds that are long form. It's just been a general experience I've had. \n\nI dunno. These are my wild guesses, because I know I've experienced similar. *Usually* anyway. I've had a few partners that were really skilled writers who were super frequent in posting, but usually responsibilities of life just kind of get in the way.",

            "body": "This just happened to me today! For the record, I absolutely adore the player and they are my friend. We've had a lot of great times in campaigns/plots, even if they're quite basic from my point of view. English is not their first language and they have some self-confidence issues when it comes to RPing, so I understand. All of the more \"verbose\" and \"involved\" players weren't available due to life. I gave a fairly descriptive midform and got a one-liner in response. Today, I just didn't have the heart nor the energy to carry the story and entertain someone who was not in the mood to add to the story after that, unfortunately.\n\nMy other players have busy lives, don't spend their days completely online, and our schedules are different. The one-liner player seems to have a lot of free time and is much younger. In my experience, it usually comes down to:\n\n1) inexperience\n\n2) language barriers\n\n3) confidence issues\n\n4) age (not always)\n\n5) laziness (luckily, not the most common reason for me)\n\n6) scheduling conflicts\n\n7) longform requires energy+work+time+experience+a lot of OOC communication\n\nThis is coming from the perspective of a GM/DM, mainly. But even in my co-writing/partner/longform experiences, the missing gratification of an *actual* co-writer (instead of someone you're entertaining, basically) is due to a lack of confidence or fear of being \"too pushy\" in their replies. Laziness has happened a couple times, usually from those that write on mobile. I get that. But it is a bummer when you're in the mood for something to move forward but you have to carry the story on your own!",

Some are much longer. The less experienced are skilled in writing but not given enough chances. There is some ridiculous hierarchy going on in RP since the pandemic where more people wanted to try out due to being bored at home but only the experienced got a chance at playing out. Skill will only come from experience. I always accept a try out so long as my boundaries are respected. New writers can be great. The increase in NSFW obsessions and 'cravings' on a great long list may also put an rper off. Time allowances need to be utilised wisely and the difference between a roleplayer and a smut seeker will immediately become apparent, usually in the writers introduction convo if there is one. If that does not happen then that can indicate lack of experience and skill. I hope this helps. My apologies if it does not... Best Wishes  \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f",

            "body": "There's also the issue of vanity and ego. People who think they're good writers already won't look at their own work with any kinda critical eye or seek feedback on how to improve.\n\nHere's a story from personal experience. I started RP when I was 18, (context; I turn 30 next spring...) I was brought into RP circles by a former acquaintance who I parted ways with years ago for too many reasons to get into.\n\nI don't write nearly as much anymore. Once or twice a week at most, even then just a couple paragraphs. But I take my time and think them through, and overall am very happy with the quality of what I put out rather than the quantity. I even took long breaks to focus on improving my personal life, education and eventually, career.\n\nBut the guy who I used to associate with? He still churns out novel-length diatribes about his OCs and fictional worlds, and they're all garbage. As in, he wasn't great at first, but time has made him get worse.\n\nThe reason why I know he's never gonna improve (besides lived experience of course) is because he's so goddamn smug. He thinks what he writes is god's gift to the 'net. \n\nThis guy literally labelled himself \"Professional Writer\" when he hasn't been paid for a single bit of publication in his life, nor does he have any professional experience or credibility. \n\nI guess the only time he was technically meeting the criteria of  *'being paid to write'* was when he used a company computer at his job, in a shared office, to write RP posts while on his shift- *and Smut-RP* no less.... \n\n....which he got caught doing, and as a result, was *fired*, by the way. Remember kids, impulse control is important! Prioritise your job over RP, especially if it's just you *trying to get your OC cyber-laid!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn so few words, prolific writers think *\"I write a lot, I know what I'm doing\"*, when in fact they don't. They don't seek feedback, they don't improve. They build and burn more bridges more quickly rather than maintaining and improving the ones they have. \n\nSo when someone stops interacting with them, on account of bad writing, bad personality, bad... anything really, they'll blame the other party rather than self-reflect, then leap into the next short-term thing.\n\nAs others have said, age and maturity is a factor. People who are good at writing probably put the time in to learn that skill, meaning they're motivated and will probably be going places IRL, which keeps them away from their keyboards and hobbies like this. \n\n*(Which isn't a shot at anyone by the way. I understand that now more than ever, a lot of people are jobless and stuck at home behind a keyboard. I've been there, it sucks)*\n\nBut on the other side of that coin? The person I mentioned above was an incredibly overbearing, possessive and toxic influence in my life. When I was RP'ing in the circles he was in and being forced to meet all these demands for frequent responses, new characters, etc, my college grades averaged D's to high-C's. \n\nAfter I cut ties and blocked him out of everything, put it all down and applied myself? Within a *single* semester, my grades went from that, to getting consistently high B's, and even an A here or there. Which helped get me a degree, which helped get me a foot in the door at a tech company which got me my job that I've had for a few years now. Because I prioritised the important stuff. \n\nWhereas *that* guy?\n\nHis resume for job-seeking (which I only saw because even *after* I cut ties, he tried to 'add me as a contact' on LinkedIn) hasn't been updated in 4 years, and lists \"Microsoft Word\" as a *skill.*",

Last week I got a response to an ongoing story-focussed RP. I wrote a reply within the same *day* as getting one, and felt proud of myself for that. \n\nShows where my energy / commitment levels are at these days, huh?\n\nUsually I'd 'put it off until the next day' at the earliest, due to a mix of 'long work hours' followed by 'now that work's done, I'm too tired to focus'.",
