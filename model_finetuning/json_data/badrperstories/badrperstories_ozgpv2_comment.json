I can go a long period of time without a steady partner, just bouncing roleplays that don't last too long... Then all of a sudden get a hit and I'm writing with a person for years. Never know whenever that spark is gonna hit, honestly.\n\nMy current longest running roleplay is about to hit 3 years, and it was legit the most random thing. I just sent her a starter with the minimal amount of pre-planning. Basically asked: \"You cool with playing a drug dealer? Drug use okay? Ok, cool, I'm sending a starter\". (the deal whenever she contacted me WAS to receive a starter with little pre-planning, so I didn't just bombard a random person with bullshit lol). Honestly, I just had an itch to scratch for a certain kind of plot, and was hoping sending a random starter would scratch that itch until the roleplay ultimately died off like every other roleplay... Except, nope. Totally just randomly worked out. And me and that partner have like 5 roleplays going, that first still going as well.\n\nThat was kind of my unicorn moment, as I haven't found another steady partner since haha. I've got one hopeful going on right now, but as it is, just gotta see how it goes.\n\nI definitely knows it's a frustrating process. Maybe start asking for samples? I might have what people call \"high standards\" as well. Idgaf though. I like what I like, and if I don't find that in a partner, I definitely don't blame you for throwing in the towel.\n\nBest of luck!",

I've got an amazing RPer that began very strong and now it's barely one reply a day...

I've been roleplaying for over a decade and I've never had as much trouble finding partners as I have in the past year, whether for group or 1x1 roleplay. Fortunately my problems haven't been nearly as drastic as yours, but it's definitely been noticeable. \n\nWhy, I have no idea. I'd guess that more people have tried to get into online hobbies during the pandemic and there's a lot of roleplayers who are new to the hobby (and writing as a whole). The people who have little to offer keep losing partners, so they keep putting their ad out, and the cycle continues.",

They'll seem extremely excited at the start and might even do all this planning, but something happens along the way and they plummet off the face of the earth. I think this happens a lot because they rush into it. They'll already be feeling a little burnt, but they go ahead and start a new role-play anyway thinking the same thing won't happen again. Completely inconsiderate of the other person mind you. \n\nBad Roleplayers aren't as much of a phenomenon as you think. There are many reasons as to why bad role-players seem more readily available than high quality writers. We all start from somewhere, we aren't magically good writers. Generally speaking, the more experience you gain in roleplaying, the more selective and picky you get of others writing and your own writing. Nobody can consistently write high quality multiple lengthy replies everyday, it's simply unrealistic because we're all bound to have our ups and downs, and as we get older we gain more real life responsibilities such as work, family, friends etc. \n\nSometimes we just don't feel inspired to write anything good at all and it's frustrating. However, to reply with obviously lacking short replies *knowing* the other person asked for matched lengths is still extremely uncalled for. Communication could've easily solved this with a simple \"Hey, I'm feeling bummed out. idk if I can match your length.\" but they chose not to :/. And that's sadly something that happens a lot.",

            "body": "Wow. Idk, every roleplayer I know or have met in the last 4 years has been hitting the 5 - 8 paragraph bracket. 3 - 4 paragraphs isn't asking for much, it's 12 sentences at minimum, I feel like most people with above an 8th grade reading level can type that out with minimal thought. That's not at all to say you're giving minimal content, I'm just agreeing that you're not at all asking for the moon here.   \n\n\nThat said, if you're clear about what your expectations are and they're agreeing to them, then you're also not at all wrong for blocking the moment they give less. It's dishonest of them. I can understand that sometimes the muse just isn't there, and some of us don't want to just fluff our way through the paragraphs for the sake of space, happening now and then - it's natural. But if they're consistently posting below the standard you set clearly in your ads, then I have to wonder how they thought it was going to end any differently than a block?   \n\n\nYour standards are not at all too high. I'd say they're about average. You're also not forcing anyone to write with you. Saying \"I write this much, I need someone who can match\" is as straightforward as it gets.   \n\n\nWhile I don't think the RP community is any more or less saturated with writers of any particular kind this year than it was 10 years ago, I do think it's a lot more spaced out across different platforms with very little cross-over, which makes it difficult for writers to find one another. There's no singular platform where all the roleplayers are. We're scattered around. Even on Reddit, we're scattered.  \n\n\n I personally prefer to find partners in the group stories I'm in, because they're vetted for activity by a staff and usually have needed to provide a writing sample to get in. On top of that, I can see how they interact and write with others before putting one of my characters into a scene with them. It minimizes the likelihood of me putting a bunch of time into posting up ads, finding someone who has read them, brainstorming a whole new story, possibly crafting an entirely new character - just to find out they're missing a quality I feel I need in a potential writing partner. You don't need to stay in the group long term if it's not for you, but it gives you a chance to find vetted writing partners that have a similar genre interest.",

I'm sure when I started back in the early 2000s, my writing was abysmal (sometimes it still is) and I couldn't imagine starting out now as an adult, I'm sure I would cry. Maybe taking another break but still solo writing might be good or possibly asking for writing samples.

That's my ideal length and I impart that idea as much as possible when I meet someone. I'm pretty up-front and I'm guessing you are too.\n\nI don't think it's necessarily your standards being too high, because someone is way more likely to just ghost you, not contact you to begin with or tell you that things won't work rather than reply to your starter with crap. Then again, I get the impression that some people intentionally wear their lack of experience or poor writing on their sleeve rather than confess it to our faces out of pride and anxiety.\n\nI don't think you're being unreasonable, tbh. Either you're looking in the wrong places or there are just a lot of morons out there nowadays. There will always be more bad roleplayers than good ones just due to demographics- younger people (more stupid, more immature, worse writers) have more time and more potential to be internet users, whilst older people (less stupid, less immature, better writers) have real lives, niche RP communities or simply don't RP as much anymore.\n\nThen again. Don't know enough about the situation you're in, what RP you're doing or where you're looking, because I don't run into this problem on the RP subs on Reddit. I post writing samples with my threads to scare off bad writers before they even message me.",

I'm finding myself getting more and more jaded with each RP and a little more hesitant about fully giving in and letting my creativity run wild. It's so, so disheartening to spend hours of your time coming up with stories and plots \u2014 stories that take up most of your thoughts and imagination while you're still hopeful that the story will actually be finished \u2014 only to have it all disappear and turn into a ghost.",

It's so hellishly difficult to find people these days who actually put effort into their characters, who actually can write well and come up with content and keep it up. I've became so cynical I will not leave anything to \"chance\" again - I will ask people for writing examples. I will ask them about their characters, what do they want to do with them and what kind of pairings they want to involve if it's romantic, if they can communicate if something's wrong with the RP and all that. Most people drop off during the cross-examination. \n\nSo, my advice: Ask for writing examples. Make sure everything plays well together - your style, your characters, your ideas and hopes and dreams. If anything seems off, drop it. You know when it's not right.",
