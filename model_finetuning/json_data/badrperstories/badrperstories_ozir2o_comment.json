You'd be surprised how many people in a group RP will try to sweep in and \"steal\" a ship. Girls who write guys open for romance plots are kind of rare, especially if they write quality guys; they end up in competition. I've been the person with a secured ship who watched other girls try to slip in and get between our characters so often that my current ship partner goes out of her way to note things like \"he is madly in love with \\[atomicsnark\\]'s character and always will be\" in her plotter and STILL ends up having to aggressively fend off thirsty girls.\n\nI don't think direct confrontation is going to get you anywhere, as Apple is very unlikely to admit to being overwhelmingly insecure and jealous. I would set some clear boundaries about how your character feels about Peach's character, politely phase out the friendship with Apple's secondary character, and just try to be easy to get along with. Worst case \"confrontation\" might be helpful to get actively enthusiastic with Apple about her ship with Peach, to help her understand that you support the dynamic and are not here to bust it up -- but really, with people who get so passive-aggressive and immature, you're probably best off just avoiding involvement altogether.\n\nQuick edit to add: if you handle this politely and maturely, you are likely to end up keeping Peach's friendship while Apple frightens them off with the possessiveness. If you try to confront Apple, it's likely she'll pull Peach into it and turn Peach against you as well. It just seems in the RPC it's always best to back away from ugly situations than it is to try to mediate, because a frightening majority of people here aren't actually down for handling things like adults lol.",

She did not care about me and I could feel that she didn't care about me, but I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt and ignored the red flags. The two times I truly needed someone to be there for me, she found a reason to ghost me. One of the times was when I was in the hospital with COVID and absolutely terrified out of my mind, she decided that she was mad at me for asking about whether or not she was still interested in our rp the week before. She used this as an excuse not to speak to me for days. She would complain about our mutual friend and solicit my advice, sympathy and help, having me run interference. One time she literally cried on the phone to me for hours. When I would try to ask for one word of reassurance, she would outright refuse.\n\nBasically, she used me completely and totally and had no consideration for how I felt. She one time told a mutual friend she \"didn't agree\" with my hurt feelings. I was always confused because I couldn't understand why this person who claimed to be my friend acted like they gave absolutely not one fuck about me. It made me question my worth constantly. \n\nI was an idiot and didn't realize that she was just jealous of me the whole time and wanted me gone. When I severed contact and left the group, she instantly went to our mutual friend and offered to take my place, completely disparaging me as a person and claiming I'd severed contact for superficial reasons. We had a good laugh at that. He blocked her. I never asked him or expected him to. She was just a horrendous person toward the end, even to him. She couldn't even compliment his art because all she could focus on was that he was better than her, and had a complete raging meltdown - I'm talking full out hateful ranting - when he changed his character's fc without consulting her first.\n\nShe got very controlling of all of our plots and inserted herself in them. She was jealous of not only our ships, but platonic relationships between characters, and was quick to equate them to how we were in real life. Whenever my best friend would bring in a new character, she'd immediately interrogate me on whether or not I intended on having a ship with this character. \n\nSo yeah. It was awful. Don't be me.
