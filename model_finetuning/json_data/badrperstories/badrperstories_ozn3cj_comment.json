            "body": "I do get the frustration regarding POC writers still being partial to white skin, but I also feel uncomfortable dictating the color skin of a character I'm not even writing. If the person understands the culture and avoids insulting stereotypes, does it... matter? Skin color doesn't make someone more or less legitimate as a POC. White passing grants them certain privileges, but it can also cause them to be ostracized within their own culture. The sense of not belonging ANYWHERE is a common issue in POCs who are white passing.\n\nWhile I understand not wanting to glorify white skin, acting as if certain shades of skin makes anyone \"more POC\" is really unfair and not a healthy attitude to promote.",
