But it made me confused, like, how am I supposed to respond to that???\n\nFinding a common starting point for conversations, sometimes called icebreakers or 'breaking the ice' , is a common thing. Either taking a fact they both could talk about or a common situation they are both in (like going to the same college) and making it something they could use as a springboard into other conversations is fine. There are a bunch of reasons he could make mention of it, easiest of which being 'Haven't I seen you around campus?' \n\nAs for this? \n&gt;like, how am I supposed to respond to that???\n\nConfusion seems like a good start. Perhaps concern. Your character never has seen them before, so why not tap into the confusion your feeling and write a response asking them to clarify who they are and what they want in the way your character would?",

I think that's a \"Well I don't know how else to get the characters to strike up a conversation, so......\" thing lol\n\nI'd say if they didn't have anything else to go off of, I'd just go with a \"Hey, you're from \\_(school name)\\_\\_, right?\" Or, some shit. Or, \"Hey, I recognize you from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". Which, I mean, that wouldn't be a route I'd personally go for either haha, but it seems more natural than them previously had known y/c name without reason, unless their character had motivation to SEEK OUT y/c's name for whatever reason before hand. But that's a lot of speculating without knowing your writing partner's actual motivation.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that's a western thing. I'd imagine it's either a matter of poor writing choice because they didn't know how else to break the ice, OR their character had some undiscussed motivation where they learned of y/c before hand.",
