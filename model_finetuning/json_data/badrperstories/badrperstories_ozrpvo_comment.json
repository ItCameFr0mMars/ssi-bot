They have a specific idea of how the character works or a reason why said character thinks they way they do and melded it (knowingly or not) into the actual canon. In this case, they clearly want said character and they want the fantasy of their character being the one who is going to fix them or the one who is going to stand among the rest of the settings stance on women and thrive.",

            "body": "Oh nicee, my first instinct was right. Ah Dead Sea, the easy to trigger guy.\n\nNow, if I remember well, I read quite a bit into the lore, and some reddit posts too, because I was considering a Legion playthrough with my female courier, and I wanted to find a justification role-play-wise. \n\nWhile I could not possibly see Caesar in any position of romance (bite me, I just can't, no offense to anybody), I can see him respect outsider women if they prove their resourcefulness. Kinda like the female courier. Someone made a nice observation, that Caesar is more utilitarian than anything, but it's the rest of the Legionnaires that are raised with this doctrine that are more sexist (considering they badmouth Caesar's chosen guest + check out Siri's dialogue as well). \n\nI just can't see Caesar overall settling for a relationship. Have offsprings? Yes. Having someone treat as an equal partner while he's the ultimate tyrant? Nope. You saw what happened to his Malpais Legate after one (big) failure, but it was the guy that helped him set the Legion on its feet. The closest to an equal he had. \n\nDead Sea tho? Circumstances COULD have him grow out of the Legion's teachings eventually. Slowly and with great effort, but it wouldn't be impossible. (Since it was also about leaders) Lanius? Maybe?? I mean even a female courier can talk a warmonger Legate out of fighting to his last breath. Even if he knew he wouldn't win, I wouldn't wonder if he took one last chance to take the Courier down, or to simply not ...retreat like let's say a coward. \n\nAlso wanted to note that Silus would have been a great legion follower too. Mostly loyal to the Legion but not to Caesar, since he knows the failure was due to Caesar's pain. Also his refusal to die and prove his actual worth. The Legion wants him dead, his leader wants him dead, and so does the rest of the world; joining a 3rd party person (some other faction, some oc, whatever), could potentially expand his horizons (for the good or the worse, it doesn't matter). \n\nKinda long, sorry. I just lowkey enjoyed speculating on their characters.",

            "body": "Seriously don't apologize because this is literally the sort of discussion on characters I always hope for when I do Legion role plays (or Canon x OC role plays in general tbh. I did one with Arnbjorn from Skyrim, my partner and I spent so much time discussing him as a character, his world, etc. and the story was amazing because of it).\n\nHonestly, I do think Caesar could respect a woman. The thing with Caesar isn't just \"women useless\", he has women in the Legion (not slaves because those aren't people apparently) because in his mind wants people in the position he thinks they are most useful. Women can continue the Legion onward by giving birth and if they're fighting that isn't as possible. Of course, we know this not to be the case as there are plenty of female soldiers who have families. But Caesar isn't nearly as forward thinking as he should be considering his position and the power he wields.\n\nBut I think that's the problem with a lot of younger Legionaries is that they aren't privvy to that line of thought and just think \"women useless\".\n\nI have a hard time seeing Caesar with a wife as well. He's so easily disappointed and often doesn't see his own failures. A wife is expected to be able to fulfill certain duties. With his age, sickness and stress levels I think someone being able to have children with him being far harder and instead of realizing that is more on him than her it would fall solely on her. People are clearly disposable to him and I doubt that he would see a wife much differently.\n\nDead Sea would have to go through a lot of change, I could see him learning to accept a wife, but not fully as an equal since she wouldn't be allowed to prove herself in the ways he wants to see someone prove themselves. In the role play I wasn't looking for a love story, which I made clear because if we were sticking to characters (and unless they wanted to see the role play last for a very long time with a lot of change through it) he wouldn't change over night. Also the fact that Dead Sea really only seems to care about battle as a whole. Not much else. He is constantly in a position if wanting and desperately needing to prove himself. Which I wonder if that stems from the fact that he was snatched as an infant and isn't born into the Legion, which most people aren't but doesn't register for him. He wants to prove he's more than where he's from, I think.\n\nThough, someone more clever than I am at the moment may be able to work out a story of him angry at being snatched away from his own and being forced into a constant feeling of needing to press forward. Through breakdown or something along those lines but I would have to put a lot of thought into how that would work and it would take a bit.\n\nLanius is who I go for more often now because tastes change and he's very interesting to play around with. But I definitely agree that Lanius would have a better chance of valuing his wife in some form. He respects ability and wit, having someone like that could gain his respect. And despite how violent he is, even with his lack of respect toward the Legion he isn't constantly slaughtering his own men so he clearly has restraint which I notice a lot of people don't seem to take into account.\n\nSilus would have been a great follower and it always made me sad we didn't get any Legion followers. We have followers who are able to accept working with the Legion (Raul and Cass for example). But to have someone tied to the Legion in some way or to have come from them would have been great and I would have loved to see what they could have come up with for his personal missions. It's a shame we never got anything like that.",

But we can sort of gage by how they treat their citizens that it probably isn't awful awful. They have their jobs and the soldiers have theirs sort of deal. They aren't slaves but they do buy wives.\n\nI guess it probably depends on who it is, honestly. Though I would imagine since the Legion loves their laws they have something in place for how they like to see things done.\n\nI wish we got more Legion lore. There's a good bit but I want more of day to day life lore, haha.\n\nYou're honestly probably right. Most people don't see it as something they are definitely doing because they already see their character as special or have their path laid out.\n\nOh yeah. I find adding OCs to Fallout or Skyrim and things of that nature the easiest. Since it's already set up for you to insert your character to some degree anyways. In particular with Fallout as you have options of how you want to see your character be as a person.",
