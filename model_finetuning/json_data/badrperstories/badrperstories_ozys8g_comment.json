            "body": "I've never done group RPs, but I'd think it'd be common courtesy for the host to at least give a warning before deleting entire threads that involved other people. No matter if the RP was just starting out or if it's been going on a while.\n\nI don't really do discord RP (I'm assuming this was on discord) because of this though. I had an experience with someone a while back. Someone I used to RP with would also just delete RPs we were in the middle of without a word. We'd have a few going on at the same time and sometimes I'd log in to find some gone. When asked they either told me they weren't feeling the RP anymore (which is fine, but I still would've preferred a heads up instead of deleting all that writing while I was asleep) or that they assumed *I* wasn't into it anymore and so deleted it... without asking me to confirm first. \n\nEven more frustrating is they'd delete these threads, and then complain that the one we still have are too similar, that there's no variety. Thing is, we *did* have variety, but *they* kept deleting all the more unique RPs, leaving us with a bunch of similar ones instead. They'd say they wanted an RP with a certain plot and then delete the RP we start with that plot. I gave up after a while. I felt like I was wasting my time doing all that writing only for someone else to just... get rid of it on a whim.",
