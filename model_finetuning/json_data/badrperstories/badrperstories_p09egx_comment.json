Inspiration is okay in my mind, as long as it does not interfere with the story too much. If, for example your character should be the only one with a animal guardian and it should be something special in that world, I would communicate that clearly to your roleplaying partner beforehand. And if they also do this with less superficial stuff (for example creating characters with the exact same personalities, backstories), I see how this can be annoying, as it is really boring if all of the characters act the same.\n\nI would talk to them about it make it explicitely clear if a trait should be unique to one of your characters.",
