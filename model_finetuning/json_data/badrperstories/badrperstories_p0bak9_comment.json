            "body": "&gt;but if you can talk to me, you can write a reply.\n\nI get where you're coming from, I really do, but this is just not true.\n\nThere are people who seem to be able to write amazingly no matter what's going on, whether they have to write on their phones, whether their surroundings are a distracting chaos or they're exhausted, etc. (Shoutout to my RP partner if you're reading this!)\n\nBut that's not the case for everyone, sadly. The planets have to align just so for me. The tiniest inconvenience stomps all over my muse. If I'm sleepy, I doze in the middle of writing my post. Sometimes I'm good and situated with a cup of coffee and ready to go to town on my post and I open up the document and ...nothing.\n\nBut in all the situations I list above, I can OOC for days. I love to be friends with my RP partners and they understand how I am. I'm sure sometimes they'd like me to go ahead and post but no one's ever said that to me.\n\nAll that said! **You are not just being impatient.** It sounds like the OOC would not bother you if the posting was more timely, and for some people it's difficult to stay immersed in the story if the time between posts drags on too long. That's fine, and I have been there, and it's simply a discrepancy of your posting style with your partner.\n\n**TL;DR, finally, the advice:** I wouldn't bring it up in the context of \"If you're online to talk with me, could you work on your post?\" Maybe steer the conversation politely toward RP to try and focus them (maybe you're just too fun to talk to!). But be honest and ask yourself if these slow posts are a deal-breaker. It might be that you guys aren't compatible in the posting speed department.\n\nFinally, a hint: sometimes a little compliment can get their muse moving. For example, \"I love \\[Character\\] so much. I can't wait to see what he/she will do in your next post!\"\n\nIt can get them excited to write their reply for you because you've shown investment and love for their writing. I suggest this because it sounds like you do have that! It can be a great thing to express it.",
