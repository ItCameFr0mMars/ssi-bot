Role play is collaborative writing. You gotta make sure everything is in order before role playing. That your partner agrees, or that your partner is comfortable. Even if they say 'yes', it's nice to be considerate and ask truthfully, to show that you really care. \n\nNow, I really hope something like this won't happen again to you. Or shouldn't let it happen. I mean role play is a hobby meant for two (or more) people. If you don't enjoy something, then don't do it. If you're too uncomfortable with something, then halt it immediately. Tell the other person what's up; and if they're anything like this guy, then he's not worth your time. If they're considerate of your feelings, you can find a common ground, because it has to be enjoyable for everybody involved.\n\nAnd even if you don't manage to find any common ground, it's not the end of the world to find an incompatible partner. It happens. There were times that I did not role play with someone, but ended up chatting and brainstorming together. Having a fresh pair of eyes go over your piece and vice versa. Can be super helpful.\n\nAt least that's my take on it.",
