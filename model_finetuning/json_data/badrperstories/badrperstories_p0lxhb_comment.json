I ask a lot of questions in the roleplay partner search process, so to me this sounds pretty normal. \n\nPersonally I'd recommend against bringing up vc interviews as an option... But this is a 100% me thing, and I don't know how others would feel about it. I'd be super uncomfortable with a voice chat, and I'd actually be pretty uncomfortable if someone proposed it to me as well. Again, this might just be a me thing, and I don't come form any sort of D&amp;D background; which I would assume is a lot more voice oriented? \n\nIdk. Sounds like they were just being over sensitive. If a question being asked bothers them, then I could only assume they wouldn't be a good fit anyway.",

Since it didn't get very far, I can't call them a stank egg but the comment about grilling too hard over seemingly basic questions and a small \"oops all my stuff\" makes me think they were on the verge of going sour anyway.\n\nKeep digging OP.

            "body": "Hey! I don't think \"interviews\" (asking questions and chatting) are necessarily bad, in fact, I think it's a good way to see if we and the rp partner mesh well together + to communicate important things like boundaries, plot, expectations, etc.! \n\nThat said, I think there could be ways to make the process smoother. One is mentioning in the ad that you'd like to discuss things further in DMs or saying that in your first message back, so potential partners are aware you want to talk (some people just want to jump right into things!). Another thing is perhaps asking the questions all at once (or at least a few at a time), especially in cases where one might take a while to get back at them. This just makes things easier in my opinion, and the person doesn't have to wait for periods at a time. They can answer all your questions, and you can get all your answers! \n\nAsking one by one, and getting back to them much later, might be a source of frustration? (Unless it was stated that you were busy! In that case, I think they'd understand.) \n\nI was wondering, could you give us samples of how you asked the questions? Sometimes, wording can be a big factor, especially in text, as tone is hard to read! (And on the internet, not everyone's first language is English, so things may become misconstrued at times!) My other question was, were you merely curious (and not accepting any more partners), or were you open to the idea of accepting more partners if you two clicked well? \n\nIf you were not going to accept more partners, no matter their answer, then that may also be a source of frustration. \n\nVC: I personally would not be comfortable chatting in VC. If that's something you'd like to do, adding it in the ad may help, so people are aware and not taken by surprise! \n\nAll in all, good luck! Sometimes things fall through, and most times it's not personal, sometimes it's us, sometimes it's them! (Also sorry, my first Reddit post! Still getting the hang of things.)",

I mean, maybe you would have given them a chance if they were a good fit? But if it was really just out of curiosity with no intention to move further, it is not the best roleplaying behavior, because you are really wasting someone's time.\n\nHm...could it be possible that you phrased your questions in a somewhat accusatory way? Some people, especially when they do 'interviews' like that always ask 'Are you REALLY sure that you have read this part in the ad?/ Are you really certain that you can write this much? / You did read the part where it said (...), right? / I am not someone who looks for quick sex plays, if you are looking for that, leave. / I guess you don't have an OC that fits a setting like that, do you? /dark fantasy isn't for the faint of heart, are you sure you can handle that?' \n\nNow don't get me wrong, these questions are okay in itself, but if they are a lot of them it comes across as if you are just waiting for them to do something wrong or as if you are constantly questioning if they are even able to read. I am not saying that you do this, but it is really easy to come across as accusatory even if the questions are not meant that way. I sometimes met people who ask all of these questions, but if I reply something like 'Yeah, I love dark fantasy and dark topics! My favourite books are (series), and I am sure we will find something we both like.' they just reply with 'Okay/Okay I guess.' and immediately move on to the next questions, and it makes one wonder if they even care about my preferences.\n\nAnd it can make people feel like you have to constantly prove your worth to them, while you don't extend the same courtesy to them. As if they are constantly saying 'I know you didn't read my ad, sweetheart, admit it/ I know you are too childish for an advanced dark fantasy setting like that, and I am going to show it to you by trying to find your flaws'. Something that a lot of people who GMed before forget is that with roleplaying, it is not that much like an interview, it more like an activity where both writers are checking if they are a good match. If the other writer seems like they are only making sure that they will have fun, while the other person has to prove themselves to them, that can give people the impression that they are rude. I think they got the impression that this was the case, especially if they claim that you ignored their own question.\n\nMy advice is (although it is hard to say whether you do this or not) that you should really build upon what they write you, not only be like 'okay/alright' and then immediately move on to the next question.",

I will say they did rush me onto Discord, I use reddit to handle the standard interview questions before I commit to any planning phase because once you get on discord things can get nasty unfortunately (as it did in this situation). I should have held my ground and clarified my intentions better but, as they say, hindsight 20/20.\n\nYou are right about it not being best roleplay behavior. I'm a terribly curious person and when they reached out to me, I was definitely open to role-playing as well with them. My intentions were not to toy with them like a cat but I can definitely see now how my wording could be seen as such. \n\nI will definitely keep what you said about interviewing in mind for the future, it sounds like best practices to continuing building upon the conversation rather than treating it like a interview. I think going into the conversation from my end on like it was a standard TTRPG interview instead of a conversation between two people definitely led to problems. In the future I'll make sure that I mention that there is a bit of an interview so that people have a better idea about the conversation they are getting into.",

            "body": "Yeah, it isn't necessarily a commitment, you don't owe them to move further if you aren't a good match. I just meant that it would be rather rude to do an interview which takes a lot of time if there is absolutely no chance that you would actually roleplay with them. Your post made it sound a little like you were just curious and toying with them. But if you say that you were open to roleplaying with them if they are a good match, there is no problem of course.\n\nAlso, I don't think that you are necessarily a bad roleplayer or anything, I just wanted to explain why behavior like asking many question might appear rude to some people, even though that wasn't your intention and even though it isn't bad roleplaying behavior to ask a lot of question. And their behavior is definitely a red flag. Like, even if I think that someone sounds a little rude, as long as they don't use slurs or insult me, I would probably just assume that our chat styles aren't a match and politely decline roleplaying with them, not try to write comment calling them out or getting mad. That was definitely a huge overreaction on their part.",
