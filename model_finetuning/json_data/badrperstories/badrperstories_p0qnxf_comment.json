Don't just say that (for example) your character can use Ki, can do this that a character can, or have personalities that resemble a character. Spin it so they can  use the, but not proficiently or such. \n\nThe best thing to do, is to take an idea, spin it, shape it so it's not cookie cuttered in and try and make it your own. Hope this helps!",

            "body": "\\-remember to make sure that your character's backstory/personality/other traits truly fit the story of the roleplay you are writing. Just because both characters are vampires doesn't mean that the lore about vampires in the world of the roleplay is the same and that the character will be a good fit. For example, it is super frustrating when people  for example write stuff like 'his parents were killed by the evil vampire hunter Sven', but in the world of the roleplay, there are no real vampire hunters and vampires can't have children. Try to change your character to fit the world, and your character will most of the time be already different from the original.\n\n\\-don't expect other writer's characters to react to your character in the same way the other characters react to this character in the anime. Seriously, that is one of the worst problems people who do this tend to have. That they limit their interactions/get mad or obviously disappointed when someone isn't suddenly their character's best friend like it was in the anime. If you are roleplaying, remember that your character and their relationship can take a completely different direction and that is okay\n\n\\-try to identify how much of a character is copied, and when it is basically the whole character/over 50% try to change some stuff.",
