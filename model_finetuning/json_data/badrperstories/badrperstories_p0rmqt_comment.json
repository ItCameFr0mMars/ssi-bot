Do not let anybody tell you otherwise. If you're not having fun, there is no point -- and I don't see how tweaking an older character to fit the setting hurts anybody else.\n\nThe more you write your characters and expose them to new situations, settings, and other characters, the better and more developed they become.

They can adapt the parent's job or identity, or the nature of what and how they steal, things like that.\n\nThe incompatible partner has OCs that are all werewolves or fairies, or their backstories require that the setting's magic system work a certain way, or they have to be addicted to the tears of an alien mentioned only on Dr. Who.

It's because they're new, unfamiliar, and I'd rather go back to my old tried and true friends I can write at the drop of a hat. And sometimes you find that you don't even care for the new character you made even after all that effort.\n\nStill, it's worth trying to flex that writing muscle and make new characters you can fall in love with. I like to throw old characters into settings as strong NPCs if I find myself getting bored or can't get into my new character, which helps. \n\nAs for new people with next to no effort into their characters outside a name and a photo? It's annoying sure but sometimes you need a little time with a player character to get a feel for them. New characters should at least have a few backstory beats to them, sure totally. I just like finding out who a character is as I play alongside them. Reading a massive backstory about someone ruins some of the \"mystery\" associated with figuring them out. Where's the fun in reading their entire backstory and then having to ask for it all over again in character? Not to bash templates or long backstories, just how I see it when someone sends me pages on pages and expects me to read it all. I'll skim but that's just me, I like to have characters get to know each other organically.",

Also sometimes people who port an OC like that don't make sure to have the OC be flexible in fitting in with the new character they are being written with. They seem to assume that the new character will do all the bending to fit them instead since they're more 'established'.",

They spent a lot of time talking about characters and events I wasn't there for, and even in all of our AUs, many interactions were predetermined between them as a result.  \n\nOh, and their most-played characters had ascended to literal godhood sometime previously, and would remain that way throughout the time I spent with them.  \n\nThey were nice people, and friendly, but they are still one of the reasons I both am wary of preexisting OCs and warn in advance that I don't like surprises (they sprung the god thing on me well into our acquaintance, when I was too committed to easily quit).  And asking people to tell in advance if their character is a secret angel, god, demon or vampire or has a  bullshit anime Ascended Form has saved me a *lot* of neck pain, because that has come up repeatedly and that's a *hard* no for me.",
