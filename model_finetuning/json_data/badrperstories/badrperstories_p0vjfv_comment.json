Because idk what it is, but it feels like now, compared to say... 10 years ago? People who demand faceclaims is WAY higher. Back in the day, it feels like more times then not, no one asked for a fc and we just did the roleplay. Now it feels like they're expected? Which, sometimes I don't mind. Sometimes I can find one that suits my character, but 9/10 I develop my character out and picture them a specific way, so it's frustrating whenever I feel pressured to have to un-do what I had in mind in order to find a face that fits. &gt;.&gt;;\n\n/a rant lol.

I am not sure he genuinely meant any harm, maybe he thought he was being helpful.... I don't want to be mean. I'm trying to be a better person. Ugh this feels shitty.\n\nI think going through and systematically pointing out every counterpoint would be giving him exactly the attention he wants. Then he'll turn about and call you defensive. No lessons learned here, you'll stay feeling miffed because he learned nothing and he'll go on his merry feeling justified that the problem is you while he was \"just trying to help.\" \n\nYou can respond with something small like \"respectfully, this is how I have fun with this hobby, and I don't mind waiting for the right partner,\" thereby implying it's not him and you didn't ask. Or just nothing at all. \n\nI think if I was in your shoes, I wouldn't altogether consider it mean to give him the one line play he wants while casually playing keep away with a very difficult character. It reads to me like he wants smut and thinks that's all any roleplayer writes for, so by playing a character that's just not interested but you're still actively engaging socially - that's not mean, it's just a little asinine. Then when he inevitably calls you out on it, you can turn it around on him to point out that cyber sex and RP aren't the same thing. Gaslight and neg him right back. Really just depends on the time you have available, but if your intention is to be the better person, just remember no one can make you feel like anything if you don't give them the power to. \n\nAll the reasons you gave for why you do everything you do, they're all valid. He's not wrong that if you have a one-line profile with real people as PBs, you'll get more partners. There's more of them. More people who start learning about this hobby because they come from fandoms, so they use actors or models and they aim for the instant gratification. Some of us grow as writers and our needs to derive entertainment grow with us. As we grow, our pool just gets smaller. That doesn't mean you're wrong. You grew out of something that he hasn't yet, maybe he never will. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with telling him his RP demographic isn't the same as yours, wishing him a good life, and moving on. Humans are not built to get along and agree with every other human.",

But even getting past the creepiness factor... Models and celebrities are just too... 'perfect'. My characters usually aren't picture perfect models. They're usually grimy, or worn down, etc. \n\nI think the closest compromise I've found that helps is going the route of actors and think of it as, \"well this the who I'd picture playing the role if I was writing a script\"... Which saying outloud, sounds weird haha. It just helps whenever I'm pushing myself towards it. Plus, if you can find a character that kind of fits that's in a TV or movie, you're more likely to find some 'candid' shots where they look closer to 'people' versus their picture perfect glamor shots. &lt;- Or y'know, that's the mindset I go with to making it easier whenever I have to find one haha \n\nOverall, it seems silly to require them. I don't require novels that I read to have attached photos for characters after all.",
