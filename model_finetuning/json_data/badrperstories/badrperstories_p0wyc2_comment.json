Sometimes people avoid confrontation, and some people are afraid to straight up tell people that \"hey, I am no longer interested in the RP, I'm sorry!\". Anyhow, I suggest moving on since unless something has happened to them it is likely they could've at least said they don't have the mood to discuss a roleplay right now but would be happy to do so later. And if you don't want to keep waiting and waiting, then maybe block them pre-emptively - I'm hesitant to suggest it and some here would eat me alive for suggesting so, but hey.  \n\n\nThis said, i'm kind of baffled that people are willing to wait up to 2 weeks for one person. if I got no reply for 3 days I'd immediately assume ghosting and move on.",

You just never know the other person's mindset or what's going on. Although, the fact that they couldn't give you some kind of response and let you know they lost interest or were busy after your check in is kind of shitty.\n\nThat being said! I'd give it some time. Maybe they fully intend to get back to you. I'd wait like a week or so before jumping to conclusions. For example, during the weekends, my activity on discord and for roleplaying is pretty much null and void. I try and let people know before hand, but I just really don't do much roleplay activity on the weekends. I've also experienced in the past a partner where I *thought* I was being ghosted because I hadn't heard anything OOC or otherwise from a person of that weekend stretch, only for them to jump right back into things as soon as they were available again. It could just be this person is preoccupied at the moment. &lt;- A hopeful assumption, so take with a grain of salt. I'd just give it a little bit more time before concluding they ghosted.",
