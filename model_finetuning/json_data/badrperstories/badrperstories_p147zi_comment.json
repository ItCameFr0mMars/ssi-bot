I've got characters who drop slurs, and who say super shitty things. Things I don't agree with at all, but I'm not my character. In that realm of things, it would be up to my partner's *character* to step up and say,\n\n\"Hey, that's fucked up. Maybe don't say that.\" &lt;- If it would be in the character's nature to do so. \n\nAlthough I suppose in this case, it seems like a blur of the writer not realizing it was an off color thing to say, so it came out of their character's mouth with little regard. So, maybe maybe your decision to point it out and have it corrected might have been best. Otherwise I'd just say, have your character say something to correct the behavior, unless you believe that would be a 'negative' route that you don't want your characters to take.\n\nI can see where it'd bother you. Usually if something fucked up is about to come out of my characters mouth, I'd OOC to my partner, \"Hey, they're gonna say something kinda fucked, and that ain't on me.\". But typically in the context of the roleplays and what's going on... Partner usually understands without the disclaimer.",
