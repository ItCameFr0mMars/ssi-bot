Ghosting still happened, but it felt like less back then. When we're kids, role-play doesn't seem like a time-consuming hobby because we have all the time in the world. However, when we're adults... it's a different story. Ghosting hurts a lot more when you are an adult than when you are a kid.\n\nYou don't have the same time like you used to and you probably put a lot more care and effort into your replies than when you were younger. It's like why even bother putting all that work in if they're just never going to even acknowledge it? \n\nIf you do quit, don't think of it as being permanent. Some people just need to be on hiatus for a long time, or you may never write again and that's fine. It's up to you and what makes you happy. Sometimes our old favorite hobbies don't hold up in the future. So, now is a great time to do explore other things you like to do.\\^\\^",
