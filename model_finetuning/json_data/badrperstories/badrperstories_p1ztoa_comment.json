Aaaaaaaand it usually is pretty mediocre smut at best, and then the RP dies. (or I realize, yeah, this blows, I'm out of here lol)\n\nAlthough sometimes smut or sex between characters quickly isn't always a bad thing. Really depends on the scenario. So I can definitely see how your story it would be especially frustrating to deal with.\n\nFor fun, I've got two examples of me attempting the same plot with two different people. It was more or less a situation where a woman is an emotionally abusive, yet dependent relationship, so seeks out 'affections' elsewhere. It wasn't deliberately meant to be 'sex' as that affection, but it was implied that it would turn into a cheating plot. \n\nPartner #1 was pushing for that smut real quick, even though like I said, her ventures were at first meant to be a seek for emotional affection. It wasn't like she was cheating out to seek. But partner #1 was pushing real hard for smut, so... It happened. It wasn't great, and felt super forced. And I bailed because it was just not turning into a fun plot, and the guy wasn't good at writing decent smut anyway.\n\nPartner #2, I attempted the same scenario again. The sex between the two characters happened pretty quickly, BUT, I didn't feel like my partner (or their character) was pushing for it. It happened quickly due to circumstances of how the story was going, but then from there, it turned from a quick, accidental one night stand, and then developed into that much needed affectionate romance from there. Everything that happened felt natural, even if it was quick. While with the first partner, it was just obvious he wanted the characters to bang for the sake of banging.",
