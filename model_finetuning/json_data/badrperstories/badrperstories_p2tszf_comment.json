It sucks that they aren't living up to what the expectations you both set was, but there is no need for any sort of attacks or confrontations. This isn't a movie, those sorts of talks won't get a result you'd be satisfied with. There was no contract they are violating here, even if it hurts and it sucks and it is beyond frustrating while you wish they would just come *do the thing that you both enjoy*. \n\nAt most you could try to have a *calm* and kind conversation about it, but honestly I wouldn't even bother with that unless you feel you can have a productive conversation without snapping at them or losing your temper. They know where you are, they know you want to roleplay; if they wanted to be writing more with you then they would. Maybe they do want to but they are busy. Maybe they will pick up interest on their own given some time. It's hard to say, but coming at them hard and being an asshole about it is *not* the way, my dude. Guilt tripping or brow beating someone into engaging with you is a bad time, believe me.\n\nMy advice to you would be to seek out some roleplay groups. Roleplay groups can be great because you can do scenes with several people in the group and not just the one person, so the 'weight' is spread around and there's more roleplay to be had. It's a different vibe than a 1 on 1, true, but it can help to scratch that itch. Also, nearly every successful longterm roleplay partner I have ever had, I found in a roleplay group. The one that I didn't, I met through roleplay friends I made *in* a roleplay group.",

So, I'm just gonna piggyback:\n\nLike /u/Mindelan said, ignore your urge to get hostile about this. The fact you say that is your \"kneejerk instinct\" makes me think the answer to your last question is yes; if you are feeling compelled to tell (otherwise apparently nice) people off because of your frustration, it might be time to take a break.  \nIt's totally frustrating when someone doesn't post as much as they promise in their ad, and there's a ton of reasons it could happen. My best guesses are:  \n\\- They were overzealous about their own availability when they wrote the ad (easily happens on a slow/boring day)  \n\\- They found something else to occupy their time (video game, another RP, schoolwork)  \n\\- They're running out of muse for the RP  \nWhatever it is, it's most likely not your fault, even if they're not feeling the RP. It sounds like things were going well and you were invested. Sometimes it just happens.  \nI would simply stop nudging them. See if they ever post without being reminded, and that will be your answer as to whether they still enjoy the RP. If they do respond to it, you can explain politely that you thought it would be quicker paced, and you just can't stay immersed when the time between replies is so long (if that's the case). Wish them well, and continue the search for a more compatible partner in terms of reply speed.  \nIf you don't want to stop RPing, I would also suggest drop-in/drop-out style RP. This entails a group and is usually real-time, so it's not for everyone. It would give you a change of pace, however, and definitely more frequent replies.",

If you actually value the roleplay and don't want to kill it off just because you're not getting the amount of replies you want. If it's THAT much of a joy-killer, I'd maybe ask them if everything is going smoothly on their end? Make sure they're still vibing with the roleplay. Or maybe they're just busy. Or have shit going on with their life. I'm sure if they have something negative going on, the last thing they want is for someone to hound them and act like an asshole (your choice word there). \n\nIdk, I get it. It sucks whenever you've found a pretty active partner, but things start slowing down. Sometimes a slow down is a bad sign for things to come... But sometimes, it's really not. I've got a partner currently who we used to get back 3-5 replies a day back and forth, but with life, those slowed to about 1 reply a day... Now they're at once a week. But, I'm not worried, because we've been roleplaying for three years, and that slowed pace is because life happens. So if all they can do is a reply a week, that's fine. I'm just happy to roleplay with them. The roleplay is showing no signs of dying.\n\nAs far as hiatuses go, I've been there a few times. My longest was 3-4 years. I only came to the conclusion that it was time for a break because things had just finally come to a stop with my then partner at the time, I just wasn't having as much inspiration... And mainly due to the fact that life was happening, so I was putting my focus to other places. That's just my experience though. Basically, I wasn't really having that same itch so found other things to preoccupy my time, so I let writing go to the wayside for awhile.",

I'm very lucky in that I have had a writing partner for years now that is as fixated as I am, but I know that can be rare to find.\n\nI will say though that while yes, often rp groups can have drama, I've overall had good luck with them and you may have just had some bad luck. If I hadn't joined a group I would have never met my current writing partner of 5+ years. \n\nAlso if you did try OC group roleplay again I'd suggest making a fresh OC for the group and not altering a current one if that had been a problem for you.\n\nIn your shoes currently what I would do is likely stop messaging the other person first for a couple weeks and see if they reach out. If they don't I might try for a calm heart-to-heart conversation one time, then I would stop depending on them for roleplay and I would go looking for roleplay groups to try out, knowing that sometimes it takes a few groups before you find one that clicks. Best of luck with whatever you end up doing, though.",
