            "body": "How old was Kevin? Sounds a bit like he was a human kid as well, although I could be wrong.  It sounds like the typical character a total beginner would create and be proud of, and then be sad that their character is denied and lash out.\n\nWhich brings me to a problem I have with your story telling...you give us so much detail about every 'side character', people who in the end don't play a bigger role than that they also found the character sheet weird, but we don't get any information about Kevin. I don't want to sound rude but...this story could have been much more easy to understand if I didn't have to get through a lot of information that was rather unnecessary. It made it a little bit hard to follow at times.\n\nThere is a lot of criticism in your post that I totally agree with, because this character sounds terrible, but with some I can't completely agree, or at least I don't see them as as unlikely as you do:\n\n\\-it is not always easy for everyone to simply have more children. I mean, take for example all the royal houses who treated their children and heirs like shit, abused them, forced them into a leading role although they had terrible mental health issues or couldn't stand the pressure and so on. I could imagine that in most families, it wasn't so easy as noticing after like five or even thirteen years 'Meh, this kid will not work out, I will kill him and later bang my husband so we can start again', especially when the only reason the child isn't fit for the role is that he does not want to, not that they are unable because of a disability or anything. That would be a lot of time wasted. Has nothing to do with love.\n\n\\-it is rather normal that some victims of abuse have conflicting feelings towards their abusers, especially if it happened in their own family. I know multiple people who have been physically and emotionally abused and their parents did things to them where I, as someone who has loving parents think 'Wow, why do they still love or are even in contact with them, I would never love someone who did something like this to me'...but if this are the people who raised you, unfortunately it often isn't that easy and feelings are often conflicting. I could imagine that killing them in such a situation would bring along some feelings of intense guilt. Not saying that all people are like that, some people rightfully hate their abuser and would be glad if they died.",

The way the other admins treated Zan's character's ability as OP without a proper explanation also seems a little bit like a red flag to me. Why is Cecy an admin now if she can't deal well with new people? I don't know...could be the language barrier or a misunderstanding, but a lot of behaviors in this group don't sound the best.",

            "body": "Hi there! And thanks for giving your comment!\n\nI tend so much in giving details when storytelling, more because is a thing of insecurity when writing about it, \"they can understand it? Is my way to writing in English a problem?\" And also, was a recent event, it happened yesterday afternoon, so I had (and still in some way) some of the negative emotions because I'm not someone who is easily angered.\n\nAnd with the 2 points I agree with that actually and I must admit that everybody can think and process things different, even when living the same experience or not, maybe it would be better writing it like 2 days or a week after to not let interfere the emotions.\n\nAlso, sorry if the lecture made you uncomfortable in some way, and I admit that I had problems when talking in English because can be understanded in other way. I would write the story (and maybe even better) in Spanish, but the Facebook pages I know about posting stories were more about \"This guy is the worst person here and no one should roleplay with that person and I'm giving that person's profile without taking in consideration that hundreds of people could harass them\", and honestly, they win more when giving the profile than when not.\n\nOh! And about Cecy being admin was because she is one of the members who stayed longer in the group, maybe more than I am and she helped about the lore and honestly, I don't see a problem when the role rarely has recruitment. I admit that in the 2 years of the role only had 2 recruitments, the first one was a failure and the second one is the where was Zan and Kevin. We tend more in inviting friends so, that's why I couldn't give so much Kevin's info, because I don't know him and was very absent, not even talking (except when Cecy wanted help him), and I wouldn't check his profile because it would be rude of my part, even after being blocked and have the chance to ask someone to check their profile.",

            "body": "Honestly, I slightly disagree that the character's story is horrible. If this overall plot is held in medieval times, it isn't really out of the ordinary that the family wouldn't just kill their child and have another one, since back then, it was a bit difficult to successfully have and raise children. However, if this person focused more on his overwhelming amount of abilities than his story, then its likely that he just wanted his character to have a sad and depressing backstory. \n\nIn my opinion, the biggest red flag overall here is the fact that he had more abilities than actual backstory in a roleplay that appears to have a lot of action/combat involved. I've seen that before, even roleplayed with someone like that, and it didn't go very well. Roleplaying with someone like that is like trying to bake a cake with a small child. While you want your cake to be fluffy, light, and with just the right amount of sweetness, they're dumping all the sugar, candy, decorations, and frosting into one bowl because they think the end product is gonna impress everyone. I'm sorry if this isn't a good analogy, I'm not great at analogies lol",

Especially if Cecy is rather anxious, you should be mindful that being an admin might become too much pressure for her.
