            "body": "I feel like Flakers actually *want* to roleplay, but their mood fluctuates and they usually aren't self-aware of their behavior. If they were, they'd at least be apologetic and open about the fact they're easily unmotivated or extremely forgetful, or whatever the case might be. \n\nFlakers can be terrific writers, but they're far too inconsistent. A roleplay should be  two-sided, where both parties agree to something. Problem is flaking is often one-sided and unexpected. Some of them do it so often... It really makes you wonder why they even Roleplay anymore. However, I think they're just that unaware.",
