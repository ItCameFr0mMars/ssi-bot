            "body": "I had a former partner who tried to push NSFW too often. Our characters were out shopping on what was meant to be a meaningful meet the parents adventure of sorts and their character kept trying to make things sexual where it didn't make any sense. I expressed concern both as my character and OOC. The RP ended up fizzling because they couldn't stop making scenes sexual even in an underlying tone. It made me feel gross. They never listened or valued my comfort and I felt more like an outlet for their personal erm needs, than our story mattering to them as it once had. Honestly, I know how hard it is to walk away from a fandom or pairing you crave and is hard to come by. But save yourself the mental fatigue and walk away if they can't shape up. You can spend your time better, trust me. :)",

            "body": "The fact they keep reiterating they're IRL ace bugs me in the sense that, \"yes, I know, you don't have to keep telling\" because anyone that is ace or knows an ace or has done any research on being ace knows there's a variety of types and not all are completely 100% no sex or pleasure. You can be ace and play a sexual character without infringing on your ace identity.\n\nSo that makes me feel like they're trying really hard to keep a line between themselves and their character because there's some bleed over they don't want to admit to, confirmed by the way their personality changed IC and OOC.\n\nWhich then says to me, they may or may not actually be ace but they might be using the \"I'm ace, I promise\" card and the stereotype of all aces being completely disinterested or replaced by sex, as a a kind of fallback when pushing ERP because a partner may be more willing to do the do if they think it's for character purposes and not because they IRL are horny or want it because \"no, it's not for me, I'm ace\" is a good excuse to them.\n\nI get struggling with sexuality and I'm on the ace spectrum myself, so it's not like I'm pulling this out of my ass, but these days it feel like calling Ace is as broad a term as being \"queer\" in general. There's a myriad of ways the ace can be expressed or understood that plain vanilla ace doesn't cover, and if they're having issues with that that they want to explore with their character that's fine, but they own it to themselves and you to be honest about it.\n\n\"Hey, I'm having a hard time knowing if I like this. Would it be weird to play a character that shares this with me so I can safely explore this preference and see what happens?\"\n\nThat being said, again, I feel like there's a level (intentional or otherwise) of manipulation here where they want ERP but won't admit to it and think forcing a separation that assures the partner they \"aren't into it for THOSE reasons\" will win them the smut prize because everyone gets weirded out if they find out their partner is horny for the smut writing.\n\nThat could be me over analyzing, but my track record here of breaking down weird partner behaviors has been pretty spot on so I figured I'd share, at least as a warning in case things get worse.",

She would ask for/instigate the scenes the majority of the time, but I was always up for the scenes and never felt uncomfortable.\n\n\u2026that is, until she made a sudden hard 180. Suddenly she was \u201csex-repulsed\u201d and criticized me for making our character\u2019s relationship purely sexual. I was puzzled by this because, while we did write smut, I\u2019d always emphasized other aspects of their ship and never asked for these scenes. She was the one who even requested that I fill out a very thorough kink survey and bragged about being a sex worker. I\u2019d always believed she was an open minded and sex positive person, so her sudden accusations and aggressive sex-shaming was\u2026 bizarre, not to mention hypocritical. It made me extremely uncomfortable to write with her. I never knew what mood she was in. One day she wanted to write ERP and the next day she would make me feel guilty for engaging in a scene she asked to write. Not only that, but she\u2019d tell a friend she was horny and suddenly turn our serious, nonsexual scene into smut. \n\nIt seemed like she was just using me to experiment with her sexuality and then would blame me for any shame she felt afterward. It was very, very upsetting, and I felt very used and gross toward the end of that partnership.",
