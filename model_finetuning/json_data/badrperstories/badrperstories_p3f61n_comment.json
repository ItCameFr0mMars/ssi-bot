            "body": "I've been in your shoes before when it comes to not being able to stand up for yourself. The problem is that it opens doors to things that makes role-playing just... Not fun anymore.\n\nI think the dude you were talking to became upset because it was interpreted as you finding someone more interesting to rp with. But the thing is, you were already in an rp that was not within your comfort zone. Roleplaying shouldn't be one-sided fun and it's far better when both sides are having a good time and putting their full effort into making it fun. \n\n\nI think you should have been straightforward about your boundaries, but that can be hard at times when you don't want to upset people. But if you don't want to upset people, then why do they get to hurt you? Setting your boundaries and saying \"Hey, I'm not really comfortable with this\" is not an attack on your rp partner; it's an opening to a conversation in which both you and your partner can discuss what you guys are okay and not okay with Roleplaying. If someone gets upset from that, you can either clarify its not an attack on them or cut your losses. Sometimes people just don't click together and that's okay.\n\nRoleplaying takes communication otherwise, no one really comes out happy. You shouldn't have to force yourself to toe your own boundaries. A good rp partner will be open to that conversation.",

For example, let's say we are creating a roleplay, I say 'Let's include witches', and you answer 'Nah, not really my thing, but we could include (...) as a compromise', I am not offended at all. Even if we don't find any common topics, at least I know that we aren't a match before I get invested in a roleplay that will not really happen. If I say 'Let's include witches' and you say 'Sounds great!' but are not really fond of the idea, I will notice that we are not really vibing/ that you get a bit reserved after that, but I can't exactly pinpoint what is wrong, as I assume you liked the idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you later tell me that you basically found someone better to roleplay with, I would be much more annoyed/hurt, because I would think that I respected all your boundaries, created a roleplay which fit your preferences, and suddenly you tell me that you would rather brainstorm with someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat would be the point were I personally would assume that we are done talking, that you are neither interested in the roleplay with me nor talking ooc. I admit that I also don't understand that part of your text, were you still interested in roleplaying the next day, or did you end the whole roleplay? If the first thing is the case, they might have misunderstood that you still wanted to continue, just not at the moment. If you wanted to end it, that would basically be the end of the discussion for almost everyone, I mean why keep ooc chatting with someone who does not want to roleplay with me, when the whole point of the chat was the roleplay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, many people find it a little rude in general if someone makes plans with multiple people, just to drop half of them and keep the most entertaining, and I guess your partner thought that was what you were doing. I mean think about it, you never said anything was wrong, they probably thought the whole planning phase was going great, just so that you could hit them with 'Sorry, I found someone more entertaining, bye.' out of the blue. \n\nVoicing it like that is something that is considered rude by most people, in my experience, so they probably thought that you wanting a conversation about it was just you desperately trying to justify something you know was rude. Like someone saying 'Pfff, I don't even know why you would be mad about something trivial like that.' and not like you did truly not understand what was wrong.\n\nIt is a bit like with any relationship: If the person you roleplay with already got a lot of hints that you might not be a got match, for example because you already told them that multiple topics they proposed do not interest you, it is often a lot easier for them to realize 'Ah, that was the problem, it was not that I am such a boring person in general.'",

You don't need to explain why you want to drop an RP, and saying that you found someone else who you would rather play with is... Incredibly rude, lmao. \n\nNext time just say 'I'm having trouble getting into this RP so I think I'd like to call it quits, but thank you for your time' or something. It's not a lie, but it's also not giving the implication that you're ditching them because you found someone better\u2013 especially since your refusal to speak up during the planning stages isn't really your partner's fault at all.",
