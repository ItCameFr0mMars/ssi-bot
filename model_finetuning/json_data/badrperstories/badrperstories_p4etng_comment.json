            "body": "There will probably be plenty of advice to come, but in my eyes if Tim wants a low-magic historical shoot out he needs his own chat or his own world for it. Teleport the city into a pocket dimension or something so he can freely develop his own cities apart from yours, without the overlap. It's a bit of retconning but it prevents totally erasing the ideas.\n\nOtherwise, if there are going to be more people, Tim needs to get his head out of his ass and operate as a group, not a single entity. His city needs to be paused until he can write out proper lore for how and why they advanced like they did and he needs to start communicating additions and changes.\n\nThe short point is if he can't or won't share ideas and progress with a group that he isn't even in charge of then he doesn't get to play with the other kids. It sucks, but if he's being a wrench then it will only cause hell for others. It sets a precedent for how they'll think they act or make Tim appear as the group \"Do No Wrong\" admin buddy that gets away with everything. Think of it from the perspective of the potential writers. If it looks bad or might cause issues, then it needs to be fixed.\n\nTim needs to get on the same page and you have every right to protect your creations. He was invited in, not the other way around. You don't owe him anything if he won't give you the minimum amount of respect for your world and if he ends a friendship over a roleplay then that says more about him than you.\n\nIf he continues to sneak things in and won't shape up, then he gets strikes. X number before he gets booted and his cities wiped from the history books. If he cared to learn then he won't burn through them, if he cared about the world and playing fair and respected you then he wouldn't burn through them. Only people that know they're at risk for losing fear the consequences of loss.\n\nProtect your RP and your dignity and set firm boundaries, otherwise more footprints will come and trample it down, and after them will be more. Obviously you don't want to give up the roleplay, so you need to protect it, especially from friends that will try to weasel in preferences and ideas you don't want but play on your willingness to accommodate them in order to get their way.\n\nIf he is your friend and cares about the rp, he will work with you.\n\nIf he pitches a fit about being too strict or more of what he's been doing where he won't adapt to the world he's in and won't retcon his cities into his own world, then he doesn't need to be the RP.",

            "body": "Sounds like you and Dan need to figure out what you want your setting to look like, what's acceptable and what isn't, and send that information over to Tim with a timeframe for him to bring his things into compliance (or have them removed). He was invited into your setting. He needs to play by your rules. You don't come into a pre-established world and railroad through your own ideas and wants. You adapt your ideas to what's already there.\n\nIt's not always a bad thing to dictate what people can do. That's going to be a part of staffing if you and Dan do open this up to more people. What if a guest popped in and went \"Hi everyone, I'm here to write a steampunk kingdom with invincible robot dragons!\" I imagine you'd tell them it wouldn't fly.\n\nTim may or may not be happy about the restrictions placed on his ideas, but there's nothing stopping him from going off and making his own server and world if they're really that important to him. And if he's going to throw a shit fit over not being given carte blanche for everything he wants, boot him. He'll be more trouble down the road.\n\nYou put a lot of work into this. There's no reason to let anyone trample all over your vision, even if they are your friend. I say this every so often to new staffers, but: build the world you want and stick to your guns. The group will survive members flaking out and losing interest. It won't survive the staff's enthusiasm dying. Make something you love and people will see and appreciate your passion. Let everyone do what you want, and sooner or later you won't even recognize the place.",
