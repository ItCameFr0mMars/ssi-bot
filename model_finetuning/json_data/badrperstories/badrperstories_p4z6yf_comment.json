            "body": "Speaking as someone who was like this as a kid, everyone wants to be 'cool'. You either want to play as the most brilliant, shining hero, or the most dastardly, batshit insane antagonist. However, younger people and newer writers in general don't yet understand what works and what doesn't work most of the time. So they see, say, a particularly dangerous villain from their favorite show with a lot of 'cool' factor. Maybe they're stylish, or maybe they're an outcast (which is relatable to some kids!), or maybe they have memorable scenes and lines. In any case, kid goes 'woah, cool! I want to play this!'\n\nAnd so, especially if they're an edgelord, they try to recreate what makes a character like, say, Nagito Komaeda, work, without taking into account what *actually* makes a character like that work. Things like the setting, the characters surrounding them, the tone, the themes that the original writer was going for, and so on. In Nagito's case, his schtick isn't just 'crazy guy', but extremely weird and complex ideas about hope and luck that fit with the things that SDR2 is trying to accomplish. To someone who is not yet versed in story or character analysis, though, they might see 'oh crazy dude who does crazy shit', and try to recreate it without understanding why it worked in the first place. This is especially true in RP, as the story is essentially a form of improv, so the themes and characters are variable and hard to predict sometimes. So Nagito Komaeda and his traits might not work if the cast is generally more on the downplayed side, and the setting tends more towards grittiness rather than... how you'd describe Dangan Ronpa, I'm guessing.",
