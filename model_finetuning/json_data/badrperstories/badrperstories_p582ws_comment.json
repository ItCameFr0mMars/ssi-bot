There probably *are* good OCs out there looking for a canon partner, but I think sifting through them will be a rough job. A good portion of the canon x oc roleplay I have seen was very self-insert wish fulfillment on the OC's side and whenever I'd see the canon characters interacting with those characters it was all very ooc and jarring. Obviously that's not going to be *all* canon x oc roleplay and I bet there is decent stuff out there, but I have yet to see any personally and I have seen enough bad examples to have me steering clear of it.\n\nAnd yeah, your assessment of doubling there sounds right on the money.",

            "body": "I think your particular problem could be just that you have very high expectations, or it could really be possible that a lot of OCs you got are not that well thought out.\n\n1. It's much harder than people think to create an OC that fits the lore AND doesn't seem a bit flat. If you add to much creativity, sometimes the character seems a bit off and writing partner's will criticize that nothing similiar happened to anyone in the series. If you only concentrate on the lore given in the book/TV series, it can be very frustrating if you don't find a lot of information to build onto for the character you have in mind. So a lot of people go the safer route 'She is just a normal girl/He is just a normal guy' or the 'Basically they have the same backstory/personality like (canon character) with some details changed'.\n2. In my experience, many of the OCs I see when it comes to this are self-inserts/ very blatant wish fullfillment, basically just reliving the romance the canon character has with their OC/self insert. Which is totally okay, I get why people have fun doing that. But some people forget to make their character appealing for the writing partner or the character they are writing against. So suddenly, you have 300 year old monster hunter (the canon character) writing against a 18 year old, and the only basis for the relationship is 'I guess she smiled at him once and although he is very cold-hearted, that touched his heart because no one has ever been this kind to him and as special as (OC)', which can seem a bit cheesy or not enough to built a functioning relationship between to characters. Or it is just 'Here, my OC that does not fit the preferences of canon character at all, make it work and them fall in love in three replies'. \n\nNow, I don't know what you are looking for in an OC, and maybe you also need to be more specific. A lot of times, when I see these searches, it is just 'Heyah, I want to try writing canonx OC' without any specification what the person is looking for, so every OC people have get send their way (especially if the canon character is popular) because people don't know what you are expecting. Maybe describe, at least in a few sentences how you envision the perfect OC for your canon character to be like?",

All that you've said as well and Nachtreiher's comment accurately describes why I was put off it early on in roleplaying. But to be fair, I started roleplaying as a teenager and my OCs were likely just as boring then.  \n\n\nI guess I'd just suggest not looking for Canon x OC specifically because, besides boring OCs, there'll be a lot of people that either want a sanitized version of the canon or only want them in name and appearance. If you wanna still be open to writing against OCs, give them a chance without promising romance just in case.",

I never considered that they might've been afraid to step on any toes and mess up lore, but it's definitely a reasonable fear. The great Mary Sue scare of the early 2000s probably put that fear in a lot of us lol  \n\n\nThe second I got much more with female OCs. The whole \"he's a jerk to everyone else except for her\" seemed pretty popular whether I was playing a canon or OC male, but it's never really elaborated *why* she's the exception. I really wished they were more open about what they expect from the pairing, scene ideas between them, and info about their character to help me out. Then again, 99% of roleplayers probably don't give much of a crap about OCs enough to wanna listen to all that so maybe they're trying to KISS (keep it simple, stupid).",
