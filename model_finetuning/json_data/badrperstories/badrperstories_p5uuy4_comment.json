            "body": "I didn't read your prior post but it sounds like she's keeping you on the hook for some reason. I don't sense her being outright cruel or malicious in her actions but a partner who can't be upfront about issues and then dance around them, isn't someone I want to write with. I like being friendly with my partners and it's clear something happened to make her pull away. You pulling away makes sense and I would have probably done the same thing. Like, why would she give up one RP without explaining why? And then joke about it? That's kind of insensitive. \n\nIt's so tough to gauge how people feel online because there's no inflection or tone. You have to take what people type/say at the value they're given. If she says she's fine, that's all the concrete info you can go off of. I tell my partners this, don't play games and if you omit information, it isn't my fault I can't fix a problem unknown to begin with.\n\nYou can always open up and tell her what you said in your last paragraph but even voicing concerns doesn't always make the other person open up and they can reassure you but honestly, actions speak louder than words. If your gut is telling you something is up, I would believe it. Writing together isn't going to work if you're on edge. My advice is to not panic and ghost but just tell her you don't feel like you click/vibe/connect like you used to and you'd like to part ways. Try to be cordial if you can and then don't block her, instead keep the door open. Or not. If you need a clean break, I get that.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you're going through this. It can be a huge emotional drain but it just sounds as though you're not really happy and if your partner is pulling away and maybe losing interest in you as a partner and the RP(s), you're almost just going along with her calling the shots. That's not a good partnership to me. I would try talking it out one more time but follow your gut and protect yourself.\n\nI'm anxious from just reading your post :/",

The times when I have left before (even for like a day), she always made sure to check up on me.  I would do the same with her. When I logged back in, she had responded to my last conversation only the day I left. Was I being super fucking selfish? Absolutely. I really don\u2019t know what I even except her to say. However, she had been growing distant for a good month, so I was clouded by my emotions too. \n\nI definitely wasn\u2019t expecting an onslaught, but I was expecting something other than a reply to our last conversation.

She seems disinterested, but at the same time she doesn\u2019t? Why ask me to come back when I left? Why do all those touching things when I did return?\n\nI just had to reply to this, because the partner I had (and eventually broke off contact with) did this too. She didn't want to be the one to break things off, even though she gave every indication by her actions that she did not care about me. It was the strangest thing, but I wanted to believe it so badly that I put up with it for nearly a year. All the while, she was talking badly about me behind my back and lying to my face.\n\nI'm not saying your friend is doing the same thing, but some people just can't be straightforward about what they're feeling. They try to convince themselves that this is for your benefit somehow, but it's cruel to string someone along. I think my rp partner kept me around as a \"just in case.\" I was never important. She outright dismissed how I felt when I tried to talk to her about it. She never saw the problem or cared to know how I felt/anything about my life. It was a very draining dynamic that had me doubting my self worth every day.\n\nPlease be careful. If you ever want to chat, feel free to send me a message. I do know what this is like and I'm so sorry you're experiencing it. :-/",

It's fine if she isn't as enthused for you as you are for her but she can't go chafing when she gets rejected by somebody she deemed a side person.  That's just an ego sting and her thinking it would be 'mean' to break it off so she turns it into panic about being rejected, because that's 'mean'.  If she can't identify/admit her own feelings it won't go anywhere, she has to learn how to do that on her own... because these types will \"Oh No It's Fine! :)\" their way out of anything.  They might well believe that.  Doesn't make it true and the more they try to bury it to Be Nice the more of a mess they make.\n\nI don't think chasing proved she 'really cared', just that she's like a dog with an old bone who isn't mature enough to admit what she's feeling because she thinks what she's feeling is \"mean\".  Maybe she's burnt out with her real life and can't fake it to make it like she did or she's like this with all her other Rps at the moment, you're not obligated to stay in a friendship because they're 'nice' though.",

            "body": "So to summarize what I've read here: Your partner communicated that she is going through a lot of things irl. She's not around as much OOC even though she still posts IC with the same frequency. This lack of chit-chat started to annoy you and it snowballed to the point that you basically ragequit your roleplay servers without ever telling her that you had a problem with her OOC frequency. \n\nI have no idea what's going on with Paige. Maybe she's losing interest or maybe she's having trouble dealing with what's going on in her life and that's affecting her availability and energy. You said that she still talks about your plots OOC, just at different times than you. I'd wager a guess that the timing is because of time zone differences and a general real-life-sucks-induced brain fog. \n\nRegardless of what's happening, it's time to cut this off. You're letting your problems fester instead of talking about them. You didn't inform her that you set a deadline for a behavioural change and then ditched her when she didn't magically read your mind and act like you wanted. You expect her to be active and invested in your roleplays even though she's dealing with a considerable amount of real life problems. \n\nBow out of the roleplay and figure out what's going on with yourself. You need to pinpoint why you reacted in the way you did instead of talking things out, and whether you're going to treat other roleplayers like this. Your reaction strikes me as wildly inappropriate and it might be time for you to take a break from roleplay. Especially with the frustration, resentment, and negativity you expressed in [your former post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/onvu12/update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Which leads me to... \n\n[Your other former post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/on9yyo/another_dilemma/) where you said \"communication was sparse on my end with Paige due to a growing attention on Emma and I\u2019s rp\" and \"We did slow communication our first month in but it was more on my side and was much more gradually since I lost interest.\" So when you started this roleplay, you didn't communicate with Paige because you weren't interested, and now a month down the line, you're bitching because Paige isn't communicating as much as you want and you think she's lost interest. Would you prefer I call you Pot, or do you like the sound of Kettle more? \n\n(You also admitted that \"I feel nothing more than a hopeless stalker at this point although I\u2019m probably just irrational at best.\" Which should have been the point where you realized that it was time to stop writing with Paige because you were getting unhealthy about it. And your complaints seem all the more insensitive to Paige since she'd apparently specified she was having \"a hard time with mental health and other schooling and work issues\".) \n\nYou sound upset that she chose to talk to other people rather than you, which is vaguely concerning to me. She doesn't owe you her time and has every right to choose not to speak with you, even if it is for 'hours at a time'. And you claim you're consistently checking whether she's online or not, which isn't great either. I'm confused because you said that she was taking a break, but then later said that she talks OOC at times and is consistently replying to your roleplay? \n\nOverall, my impression is that you got mad at someone for doing exactly what you already did to them, made mountains out of molehills with her other behaviour, and then weren't capable of addressing any of it. You admitted that you've behaved in a childish and petty manner, and described how you've lashed out at Paige because she no longer meets your standards. Frankly I don't think she deserves this kind of treatment.",

            "body": "Okay. You make a couple of good points, but at the same time you\u2019re definitely wrong about a couple of things. Of course, I didn\u2019t elaborate on a couple of things, so it\u2019s definitely not your fault. I really should of been clearer. I apologize for that. \n\nPaige and I have been talking for almost a year at this point. Our relationship hasn\u2019t just been a couple of month type deal. Although I\u2019ll confess that I was definitely not as interested initially as I was now, that was for like a couple of weeks to a month of our relationship when it first started. It\u2019s not like I ghosted her or anything. Did I not talk to her as often in that brief period in our relationship? Of course. However, at the same time I still made sure to reply a couple of times a day and I didn\u2019t try to neglect our rp. I still replied etc. I was still pretty active. \n\nThe time difference didn\u2019t actively help as well. I think part of the reason why I wasn\u2019t as interested was because of the huge difference. Emma and I lived in the same country, so I didn\u2019t have a problem with time difference. Again, I would still try to at least reply to her a couple of times a day when she was online. I still was trying getting to know her and get a feel. \n\nHowever, I grew to really like Paige as a person and our conversations soon turned into hours at a time at some points. Of course we would take breaks and etc. I don\u2019t expect hour long conversations everyday. That\u2019s ridiculous. However we actively communicated our schedules and etc. I even started staying up super late just to talk to her. And I\u2019m talking late. She started staying up later for me as well. It was a two-sided relationship. If someone was busy, we would give each other a heads up. \n\nThen suddenly, the communication dwindled. It become one-sided all of a sudden. She wouldn\u2019t reply for days. I was blinded side, and she gave me no indication anything changed. I would still stay up late just for her (if she was online, hence why I checked). Still, nothing. I was frustrated, but I knew something must of been happening behind the scenes. I asked her a couple of questions similar to this: \u201chey, is everything okay? If you need a break, just let me know! I totally get it.\u201d But she would assure me everything was. Yet no communication on her end, and in our group chat with others she was still talking with the others. Even then minimal replies if I replied to something she said in the group chat or to someone else. \n\nSo I started getting upset. Even when we did talk, she would be the one ranting. When I tried getting a word in, she would often stop talking to me or completely ignore anything I said. I talked to a mutual friend, and he told me to take a couple of days off from Discord. This was when I was on vacation. So I did, expecting her to at least check up on me (again, no idea why I expected her to do anything). When she didn\u2019t, I got mad but waited before I eventually left our servers. It was a fuck it moment. I was being childish, but at the same time I would of never done this if this wasn\u2019t an ongoing problem. I often am the one who stays too long in toxic role play relationships. When we reconciled, she finally told me about her problems and I felt bad. \n\nAt the same time, I had a lot of things going on myself. Paige is going through shit, I understand, but I was too. It wasn\u2019t like my life was perfect either. However, I made sure to at least actively communicate this with her and others. So would usually of done the same before this whole thing happened. I get if she didn\u2019t want to worry me, and took a couple of days to herself, even without a heads up. I get it. However, this was weeks of her disappearing without me knowing nothing. It could of taken her a couple of seconds to let me know before it got to this point. \n\nWas I perfect throughout this entire ordeal? No. However, I don\u2019t think you can say Paige \u201cdeserved better\u201d either. I try to be understanding, and I\u2019m usually super laid back. The rant was just that, a rant. I don\u2019t think those are usually super positive. Sorry this is so long.",

            "body": "I get that. Roleplay is just a hobby after all. Again, I apologize, since I didn\u2019t make this clear at all, but Paige\u2019s problems were more speculation before I left. I had a vague idea what was going on, but I actively asked if she was okay and needed a break, etc. She always told me no, she was fine. Yet for days she would go without contact (this happened for around two months), and I never got a heads up. Even if it was an once or twice type deal, I would of understood. Not super cool to do that, but I get it. Sometimes you just need to take a break without giving anyone a heads up. \n\nHowever, I never got any true indication and she assured me everything was fine when before she would of given me a heads up. It was more speculation on my behalf. I go more in depth with this with my previous comment above yours, so I\u2019m not going to repeat everything I just said lol. \n\nI had shit going on as well. My uncle cut off contact with my family and was threatening harm to himself. My roommates were bickering among themselves. I went on vacation. I had issues with my family. However, I made to to start least let everyone know I was going to take some time off. It doesn\u2019t take much to do that. \n\nOnce I did leave, it started coming to light. That\u2019s when I found out. She told me more about it, and I finally got more insight. Then again, she assures me everything is fine but she\u2019s regressing back to the same behavior. Again, no communication and it\u2019s becoming more and more one-sided. \n\nI am invested in our story, but I care more about her. There\u2019s was no way I would of made this post if I only cared about her replying. Paige doesn\u2019t owe me her time. I get that. It\u2019s a hobby. Not a job. However, I\u2019m not going to continue being in a one-sided relationship. I was ready to make a clean break. I thought that\u2019s what she wanted. I don\u2019t understand why she wants to keep me around if she has been ignoring me for months. Even if her issues are really bothering her, why not let me know she wants a break or wants to stop communication for a while? \n\nI\u2019m just lacking communication from her end, when before I would of gotten it.",
