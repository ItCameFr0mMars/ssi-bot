Instead, this sends the message 'I know what I said in my preferences, but I am actually totally fine with short replies'. I even know people who would get annoyed if their partner only pointed out an ongoing problem later on, because it creates the illusion that there is no problem/everything is perfect, just so that the other person would say 'Sorry, actually I had a problem with your replies all along.' \n\nI would probably write something like 'Hey (their name), I really enjoy writing with you and I hope we continue writing this roleplay. But I prefer replies that are a bit longer and match my length, so about four paragraphs. Is it possible that you could write a little longer replies?'\n\nIf they get angry, they are not the right partner for you. I mean think about it: if they don't want to write more, and you don't enjoy short replies, there is really no way to compromise. It is better if the issue is resolved now than waiting and getting even more attached to a roleplay that might not work.",

Just to piggyback off that, OP, I suggest that you request a writing sample in your ads just so you can ensure they have the quality of writing you are looking for, especially if you are a novella or literate writer. I've done it because not only do I want partners with longer responses, but I also want to make sure they don't get overwhelmed by my own long response.\n\nMost people make the effort to match their partners but it is also dependent on what is happening in the scene because if they believe they can fully portray how to respond to a longer post with something significantly shorter, that may be better than having them add in bland fillers just to match your length.",

            "body": "I used to ask about samples (I do offer mine even if not requested) and I'm pretty clear about how much I like to post. I think for this ad I made it so quickly, I had left out 1-2 important things and I'm blaming myself for leading this person on. But I've never had a partner who enjoys such a difference in posts sizes before. I guess it was wrong of me to assume stating my style, meant others would reach out with a similar mindset. For all I know, this partner is happy with short posts and doesn't see it as a problem the way I do, I will say something. I just hate feeling like a shrewd person. But this partner is beginning to hassle me for a post after only a day even when I sent them 2 paragraphs OOC saying I don't want to be hassled to post unless it's been over a week but that chatting OOC is cool. I just had being pushed to post, I have stuff going on and it's why I strive to make my posts lengthy. I get the feeling my partner might be young, with more time for quick posts. Def not my thing these days. :/\n\nThanks for the advice, I should push writing samples more, I have been lax these past few months. It just sucks, this was a fandom I have only done twice and have been fighting to fill the void but so far, I guess no luck. I",
