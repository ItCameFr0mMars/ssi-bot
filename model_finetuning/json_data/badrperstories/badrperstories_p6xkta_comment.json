Not sure how good a ban would work out but honestly I do think reddit maybe needs some visible age policies or something or the accounts have the age info hidden but subs can set age limits that quietly prevent kids from seeing or accessing those subs because the age is stored in their profile data or something. Changing it means going through the hassle of an age/ID check it making a brand new account from scratch, which is tedious. Idk I'm not a programmer.",

I started getting big into RPing shortly after turning 18, but had written one way or the other before then, and had 2 or so years of D&amp;D under my belt. Obviously I know I'm not perfect, but I have found to vibe better with people who are in their early-to-mid 20s as I can relate to their life situations. (19 at the moment) I wouldn't RP with anyone underaged, but I do understand people who want SFW stuff and may be above their fellow writer's age group finding requirements to be a big roadblock...perhaps a board tailored to that would be a good way to group skilled, teen writers that don't fit the criteria but do have the passion needed for it. Sounds idealistic, but that is honestly the only way I see people like those breaking the mold of edgelord OCs that are the norm at that age where you don't have much experience with handling complex characters. \n\nNow NSFW? That's different and I do agree people who seek that out with adults should be at the very least booted from the community as a way to prevent actual predators from reaching out to them instead of people who mistakenly believe them. Not that it will stop them, but it can save them from being manipulated or worse.",

You might want to write with better writers than yourself (or you might perceive yourself to be a better roleplayer than you really are), or you might simply want to write NFSW with someone  who seems to be an adult (and you know that revealing your age has a good chance of forfeiting it. I mean, I know it's unwise and all now but when you are in your teens it might not occur to you why that might be a stupid action to do.  \nSo, uh, yeah, it's essentially the idea of not being \"one of the kids\" and such. In some cases said minor might be 17 and hate the fact that he is a year too young for many roleplayers, with which I can actually sympathize to a degree  as I've got the same situation with those that place 21 as their age requirement.  \n\n\nGenerally, those are the thought processes those who lie about their age have, and some are good enough to not get caught, though that's just a few.",
