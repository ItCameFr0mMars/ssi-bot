            "body": "Ehh, it's tough to say if you were being a dick or not entirely, as it depends on how much you communicated \\[or at least tried to\\].\n\nDid you ever communicate with your friend to try to find a compromise? Like did you actually *tell* her that you were going to compromise by not making her character die \\[but instead making them intensely hated by people\\]? I mean you really *really* have to communicate about stuff like this, as you're messing with an aspect of their character still \\[in this case you're messing with their reputation\\]. It's better to be cautious and make sure you're communicating your ideas than to say piss off a friend.\n\nOf course I would say it sounds like an everyone sucks here situation based off of first impressions, because your friend also needs to talk to you too \\[especially if they're not happy about her character being chased or being unable to join the Death Eaters\\]. She needs to pitch her own ideas if she hates the idea of her character being chased \\[or not being allowed to join the death eaters\\]. RPing is a two-way street here \\[and it's very annoying to be the partner that's left to think of everything without a little help from your partner\\].\n\nAs for the advice, if you want to try to salvage everything and make your friend feel better it boils down to three things: apologize, hand over the reigns at least a little bit and COMMUNICAAAATE \\[in this order\\]. You can tell you hurt your friend's feelings at least, so apologize for not communicating your idea with the Death Eaters thing \\[and maybe the notebook thing, but tbh I think the bigger deal would be the Death Eaters thing\\]. Then maybe try to hand over the reigns to some degree? I don't know how roleplaying works between you two, but maybe she feels like she can't try out certain ideas of hers with you, resulting in her feeling stifled and frustrated. And lastly, you do need to communicate with her. It'll help make it clear if you two could actually work as rp partners or if you two just need to stay friends \\[that don't rp\\]. Especially since some people just don't work well together as rp partners. You'll be able to tell, especially if they're not willing to compromise and work with you \\[by pitching in their own suggestions if say, they hated their character being hated/used as a front for the Death Eaters\\].",

Besides communicating more [and directly saying if you're not crazy about an idea], I would also still say at least try to work on handing over the reigns a little bit; because with the additional context it sounds like you may be being a little bit rigid when it comes to the AUs [I imagine not intentionally]. If it's not taking place in your \"canon\" verse, then I'd say it's an opportunity to do explore things that would likely never happen if your \"canon\" verse. Rules and various things can change in AUs [such as your friend's character's chances of being able to join the Death Eaters going up]. Of course it's still an everyone sucks situation as it sounds like everyone needs to communicate a little better here. Like if she's unwilling to budge about the issue with the Death Eaters in some way [that don't include holding a plot-important wand hostage unless if her character's able to join the Death Eaters], then you guys would probably be just better off just dumping the idea. Especially since it is also rude for her to just hold a plot-important item hostage in discussion [and annoying]; without at least attempting to find a middle ground where you're both happy.",
