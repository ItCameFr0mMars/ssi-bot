Let feelings (or lack thereof) develop organically with these characters -- but also leave your Bruce open to meeting other characters in this RP.\n\nWhat's happening now feels like Selina/Rachel's author is handing over a character she has secondary muse for because she likes Bruce, but is shipping more enthusiastically with Harvey right now. Since it sounds like you really enjoy writing Bruce, I think pairing him up with Selina might bring you into a situation in which you have higher motivation than Selina's player for the ship, and it's likely to lead to resentment if she's more excited about her Harvey/Rachel ship.\n\nMaybe having Bruce encounter a new potential romantic interest will increase her interest in the plot -- or maybe he'll meet someone whose player wants to ship with him as much as Rachel wants to ship with Harvey.\n\nEither way, it's a sucky feeling to feel like second fiddle, so I would not bank too much of your character's story and development on this ship. (Hope I got the names/situations correct!)",

Harvey and Rachel clicking is a thing that just happens sometimes, but I'd lose all trust for the Rachel roleplayer due to how she handled all of this so carelessly. Honestly it sounds like she may just like the 'power' of having her character with the hot new shiny leader-man of action.\n\nI wouldn't ship with her other character, but that's just me. It would feel like pity and I don't vibe with that. I'd probably leave the group but I would do it without causing drama or any problems. There's nothing productive to be gained by talking to them about any of it since you can't force the ship on Rachel of course, that would be terrible, and there's no other 'fix' to be had here. What's done there is done, and for me at least, seeing the reminder of that whole thing staring at me would sour my love for roleplay with that group entirely.",
