Although my partner is usually aware of my pacing, and usually I kind of match pacing.\n\nOOC also just... various on how much I feel like talking to a person? And it's no slight against them. I have one partner where we OOC every day, because we've become friends. So we chat daily. Roleplay responses are every few days to every week or so.\n\nAnother partner of mine, we get replies to each other every one or two weeks, and we OOC pretty much ONLY whenever there is a new reply, because we only talk about the roleplay rather than our personal lives. The roleplay seems to be going just fine like this, and I sense no tension. And if one of us is quieter a little longer than usual, there is usually little concern unless like a month has passed.\n\nI dunno. Maybe I'm just real patient with people, or maybe I'm a problem in other people's eyes and just don't know it. But as I see it, we're all adults, close to, or in our 30s, and roleplaying and communicating OOC just isn't a daily priority. I enjoy roleplaying, but I also want to respect my partner's time-- Regardless if I see them online or not and not replying. Also I disagree that just because someone seems to be online and on discord does not mean they are automatically available to respond. I'm probably ALWAYS online in one form or the other, and that most definitely does not mean I'm always available for replies.",

You've communicated with him, gave him months to do things differently, (again, just me) I'd accept that that's the kind of partner he is, remind myself that's not the partnership that I want, and value myself enough to cut him loose so I can find the partner that works for me.",

Being alive and/or on the computer doesn't make one available and/or obligated to respond to RP.\n\nI and a ton of other RPers I know are constantly set to Do Not Disturb on Discord for the *exact* reason that some people get it in their heads that \"online\" = \"online and able to pay attention to me.\" They're not the same thing.\n\nFor the sake of everyone involved, including yourself, I suggest you don't read things into people's status on an app.",

I have a partner who\u2019s pretty consistent with replying to the RP itself, but OOC chat has been non-existence when before we would be pretty active. She disappears for days (I know she\u2019s online most of these days), but like no heads up. At all. Like you, I don\u2019t care if this happens if she gives me a heads up. Life happens. However, she gives me nothing. Lmaooo she even accused me of ghosting (weird the same thing happened to you) when I left the servers when I got fed up of this same behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if she is going through shit, but she has been doing this on loop for two months. She at least let me know more about her problems after I left, but it\u2019s happening again. I feel bad because she is replying pretty consistently, but without the OOC chat it feels worthless. Glad I\u2019m not the only one experiencing this, but it also sucks because you feel as fed up as I do. \n\nI wish I could help you, but I also have no clue what to do. I hope things turn out well for the both of us. I know the genders are different, but it seems like we have the same partner lol.",

However, I feel like OP\u2019s partner must of been at least pretty active in the OOCs chats before otherwise they probably would of not of asked for advice. Of course, I could be wrong, but I\u2019m having a super similar situation I can\u2019t help but think OP and I\u2019s partners are the same person lol. \n\nOOC chat certainly isn\u2019t required, and it even varies from each of my partners (a really good point you made). Like you, I only chat with one partner when we eventually reply around once every two weeks. Even though it\u2019s minimal, we established this dynamic since she communicated her busy work schedule with me and keeps me in the loop. I reply with her less than my one partner I\u2019m having conflicting feelings for. This is because she at least lets me know what was going on in her life and didn\u2019t keep me in the dark. \n\nI think OP is just lacking communication from other partner and has no idea why it\u2019s become so minimum. I\u2019m guessing the OOC chats were a lot more active before and OP can\u2019t help but feel like they messed up when the communication was cut off. \n\nI honestly feel like OP should try telling their partner about their concerns, and if they continue the behavior, to cut them off tbh. Communication is key.",
