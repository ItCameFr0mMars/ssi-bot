We don't see how people get along and how they're treated. And there are so many ways to run a server. It's YOUR server, so ultimately you get to say how you run it. It would just be rude of us to give all sorts of advice on what to do about that when we know so little.\n\nI'm lucky enough that I run a pretty small easy-going server, but i've definitely had my fair share of people calling me names and taking advantage of me giving them the benefit of the doubt.

            "body": "Yeah, that's definitely a thing. We're everyone's favourite punching bag. I think a lot of players assume that all Admins are automatically going to be tyrants, and admittedly it's easy to slip into that when you feel so disrespected constantly. I've had many conversations one on one with players where I just have to be human with them like:\"You see all that I do. You see that I'm here every day, online for players most of the time, despite also working. You see that I'm active. I'm trying my best, but I am human. Would you be okay with someone treating you like this?\"\n\nMost of the time, they get it. It helps that my server is all 18+, so we can expect a certain level of maturity. You can make your personal settings so that you don't see the pings until you're in the server.\n\nAnother thing that helps me is that I don't equate the number of players in my servers to success. Success, for me, is the stories we create and the character development we get. I can do that with 5 people. I can do that with 30. I don't think I could do that with 100+ people because I want to know *every* player. I want everyone to feel like they matter when they're with us. Sometimes I miss the mark, but I'll always try my best. And because the numbers don't matter as much to me, if someone's being disrespectful, I'm very quick to show them my boundary and remove them if they cross it again.\n\nIt's not tyranny to do that, though I'm sure others might disagree. Stories are not public access. They are not businesses. No one is entitled to every story. A Discord RP Server is usually like a private club. You need to be a halfway decent human being to stay and collaborate in them. And you, as a staff member, are not paid to run your server. In that, no, I don't think it's bad that you're disinclined to take shit from people. You're there to write, same as them. You're a role player too. But there does need to be a balance. Only you can define what you'll give to achieve that balance, but it is necessary.\n\nIn the example you listed specifically, I'd tell the players that it's very simple. The rules regarding the No Ping policy were outlined when they joined. By applying, they consented to following all your rules, all your policies, as well as your lore. They can either respect your boundary as well as following the rule, or they can get the actual fuck out of your life and out of your server.",

            "body": "&gt;i just usually pick apart their sheet in bullet form?\n\nI used to do something like this. Not pick it apart, but when I gave notes for revisions needed to approve their applications, they came in bullet form. What I found is that doing that makes people feel like their passion and intellectual properties are being insulted. So now, I approach them as a conversation.   \n\"I have your notes ready whenever you are. Please be aware that all applications typically require 2-3 edits. This is, by no means, a commentary on you or your abilities as a writer. It is simply that we have a lot of lore, and it's very easy to forget things when you first join.\"  \nThen they confirm that they're ready, I send them in two parts usually, depending on what needs sprucing. If it's the entire concept though, I'll approach it like   \n\"Tell me what it is that drew you to this particular concept.\" Then I'll ask \"what are the basic bones of this concept that you 100% need to keep.\" And we'll brainstorm, together, to find something that fits both their muse as well as my lore.   \n\n\nCursing, I don't think is much of a problem, but it helps to use emojis so people don't think you're mad at them or otherwise passive aggressively belittling them.   \n\n\nThen with the common situation you listed, I can only hope you're not actually calling their ideas stupid. No matter how coherent your paragraph, it is incredibly rude. You're going to know your lore better than others. You wrote it. You know your mind better than they do. It's easier for them to forget things. You can be honest without being \"brutally\" so. That was a really hard lesson for me to learn too.   \n\n\nI'd link them to the channels with the information that would explain why their idea wasn't feasible. Or, if I know the player is shyer, I'll usually take it to DMs because I don't want anyone to feel publicly called out if I can avoid it (which was another lesson I learned the hard way). But, you see that the person has an interest in this thing, right? This is a great chance for you to help them feel heard. Ask them what they like about the idea, why they want it for their character, what sort of development are they hoping to gain from it, and then you can help them find a way that works with your lore while still allowing their muse to have a version of their idea. Being open to collaboration is the majority of this hobby, and Admins need to be open to it too.",

His personal special thing that was OP as fuck didn't get approved? Cue weeks of ranting and bitching about the mods being biased. A friend of his committed a serious rule break and got banned? Cue bitching about how it wasn't serious at all, the people affected weren't worth protecting, and having the rule in the first place was dumb. And so on...\n\nHowever, he clearly had problems with authority figures IRL too. He was arrested and convicted for drug possession and put on probation. He had frequent drug tests and meetings with his probation officer and sometimes court appearances to make. He constantly bitched about all the people involved with this and his bad attitude landed him a few days in jail here and there. It shined some interesting light on his OOC and in-game behaviors.",
