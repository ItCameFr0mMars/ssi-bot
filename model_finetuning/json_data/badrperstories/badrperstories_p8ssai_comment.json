            "body": "I don't altogether agree with most of this, save the definition of \"OP.\"   \n\n\nIt's not really an issue I have though, since I exclusively play in groups. The only server I'm in with special abilities has a very clearly defined ceiling, so the only way for someone to get over-powered is through the story and *pRoGrEsSiOn,* but that's my preference, you're entitled to your own. Everyone starts out with the same level of magic, and we use dice to determine what's done and how big the explosions are. You'd hate it, honestly.   \n\n\nBut that's okay, because again, everyone's got their preference. You're right when you said \"I don't know about you guys, but the best RPs only last a couple years at max, and those are super, super rare to come by.\" You're right in that you *don't* know about me. My main server, the one with the clearly defined ceiling, has been running for over 3.5 years. Doesn't look like it's slowing down either. I'm not a unique enough person to claim I was just that great to have created a concept that's lasted this long. Off the top of my head, I can name (and provide links to) at least 10 other servers that have all lasted 4 years or longer.   \n\n\nYou probably wouldn't like any of them, because the one thing they all have in common, including mine, is their lore, which inherently restricts against characters that break the ceiling. That's not a knock at you. It's just support to say that you've proposed this entire post as if it's fact, and it's not. It is entirely based on your personal preferences. You think someone playing a character that builds up through their life to get to a place of power is \"lazy writing.\" Conversely, I think that playing a character that's already fully developed in their strength is \"lazy writing.\" The stories that make it to theatres, usually, are the stories that show growth, and there's a reason for that. From my perspective, you're touting the sequels as if they hold a candle to the originals.   \n\n\nI could not physically make myself give less of a shit about your omniscient pseudo-god character with the way you've described them, *but* if you spun it with him being alone for the first time in his life, not knowing how to control his abilities, killing innocent people by accident and thinking he's a monster? I could get on board. Show me his progression. It's not the dirty word you think it is. Stories need progression to \ud83c\udf87*progress*\ud83c\udf87. If you're not willing to put in the work for your own character's story, beyond a bio, then it's a little ironic for you to think you have a leg to stand on when calling anyone else a *lazy.* And before you go saying \"this is why you get ghosted,\" I haven't been ghosted in over a decade. None of what you're complaining about applies to me, but I'm not going to sit here and let you insult half the community, with such blatant falsehoods, just because they have a different preference than you, guy.   \n\n\nJust take the L and move on. If they don't like your character because it's too OP for the 'verse of their character, who gives a shit?",

Your character very obviously *is*, but if you don't think it is a problem and you're getting all the RP you want because your roleplay is just full of all the sick and dope action, *and* with a lack of ghosting because you're 'getting it right', then why are you bothered if people say your character is OP? Sounds like you have things on lock for the way you like them to be.\n\nI have a setting with my writing partner where we both have characters that run the full spectrum of 'OP' down to normal humans with no special abilities at all. We choose what works for that particular character/plot, it's a great time, and you know what? The roleplays with the mega-powerful characters aren't somehow better than the ones with a normal human in the mix. Being able to fold another person into a pretzel or throw a car through a building doesn't somehow make the roleplay better, at least not in my experience.\n\nI think maybe you're feeling self-conscious that people don't enjoy what you enjoy, and you're not realizing that you are disproving your own final point. If your roleplays are only lasting a few weeks then obviously your secret sauce of adding higher power levels isn't working the way you want to pretend it does.",

Yeah, no wonder you have complaints, then, because I can't think of many rpers that would want to rp with you at this headspace.

            "body": "I have twenty years of RP under my belt and in that time have discovered that writing rants about how my preferred way of RPing is the *objective correct way* on public forums makes me sound like a bit of a blowhard. \n\nYou seem to think roleplay is just about getting to a certain power level/evolving the character in terms of their abilities. That's a pretty bold assumption to make, honestly, even within the 'super' subgenre. I have certain characters who will always be \"weak\" or \"low level\", because the story I'm looking to RP isn't a superhero origin story, I'm more interested in the deeply existential horror of someone contending with their own inhumanity. Superpowers can be about fighting battles and saving the world, but they don't have to be. When I dabble in the 'super' subgenre, I personally like to write horror stories, origins gone wrong, etc., and those aren't stories about making my characters powerful. \n\nIf you want to write stories about people with godlike powers walking the earth, that's fine, but it's incumbent on you to seek out other people who are interested in the same thing instead of browbeating other people for not acting out the plots you want. It may be shocking, but not everyone is interested in roleplaying the stories you want to RP. If someone wants to write a zero to hero story, that's fine. They aren't a good partner for you, but they're doing nothing wrong. For the life of me I can't understand why anyone wants to RP coffeeshop AUs, but I don't rant bout how their choice of RP sucks and I hate it, I just don't RP with them. \n\nYou're having a communication problem. That's on *you* to fix. When you put up and ad or join a server, make sure that everyone else involved is planning to start their characters at \"legendary\" mode, and the problem is solved.",

Oh, and as most people have said here, RP isn't necessarily defined by high-octane action and overpowered characters. It's defined, as most stories are, by the characters evolving and growing. You know, that progression you railed on? Zero-to-hero trope is used so often because it's simple and because it's worked so well over the years in the storytelling medium. Doesn't make it bad, it just makes it a trope.\n\nOh, and I should point out that your tone is in no way effective in getting your point across. It's patronizing, rude, and elitist as all hell. I'd say more, but then I'd just be repeating what others have said",

            "body": "So if this is the style of RP that works for you, great!  Go for it!  But you don't get to tell other people what should or should not be fun for them.\n\n&gt;The term \u201coverpowered\u201d (OP) implies that there\u2019s a base standard of power in the universe you want to RP in.\n\nYes... this is true.  *Every* setting comes with an expectation about how powerful the characters can be.  Even in superhero settings, like X-Men for example, while there are characters who have insanely powerful abilities, those exist at one end of the bell curve.  Most characters have a single, relatively modest power with clear limitations. For example, Nightcrawler can only teleport if he knows where he's going to avoid getting stuck in objects.\n\nLimitations like this exist not for the sake of progression - Nightcrawler is never going to gain extra powers - but for the sake of dramatic tension.  If a mission requires him to risk his life teleporting into a room he's never seen before, that's a scary, tense situation and we have no idea how it'll play out.  When he succeeds the reader breathes a sigh of relief.  If your character knows that nothing can hurt them, ever, most people would find that boring.  Maybe not you, and that's fine, but the fact that a lack of danger is boring to everyone else is why complaints about OP characters exist.\n\n&gt;Plus, I have a rule that prevents me from landing attacks on my partner\u2019s character, even if I\u2019m just playing as a side villain along with my main character. No touchy. Ever.\n\nWhat is the point of making a super powerful character if they can never hurt anyone?  This brings me to the second reason a lot of roleplayers don't like superpowered characters: it breaks immersion.  If you've got a guy who can punch through walls and mind control other characters but he never succeeds at anything for plot reasons, that kills immersion for everyone else.\n\n&gt;If we\u2019re playing against each other, I cannot kill your character.\n\nYou should try it some time.  Character deaths can add so much drama to the story.  It can make the world seem truly dangerous.  But you're not looking for story-driven RP I guess, just characters smashing each other through walls, which again, is totally fine, but it's also fine that some of us prefer other types of RPs.",
