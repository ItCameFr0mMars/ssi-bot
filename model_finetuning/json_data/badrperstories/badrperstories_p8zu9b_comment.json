            "body": "I hate to say it, but if you're having people repeatedly leave an RP after one day (like, it happens over and over and over again), there's probably something going on on your end. Not sure how much you're being hyperbolic; I'm not sure it's time to do deep self-examination if it's just...two people or something, since people can be flakey, and it seems to me that particularly right now there's a lot of false starts/stops going on due to the summer slump.\n\n*But* if it's really a recurring issue, then consider the following:\n\n\\-Is there something deceptive in your ad? Are you presenting yourself as an extremely advanced writer, but your posts don't live up to this? Are you presenting yourself as relaxed and laid back but are actually very intense and passionate? Are you downplaying the amount of ERP you actually want, or being coy about kinks, only to spring it on them later? Did you forget to mention the part in your ad where you expect 5 replies a day or some other requirement that might put most people off?\n\n\\-You said you have a \"set\" RP. Are you leaving room for collaboration with your partner, or are you calling all the shots? How much of this is just you trying to find a random person to slot into this story you have completely filled out in your head? Are you open to their ideas, or is this concept something you're extremely protective over? Allowing someone modifications around the edges might not be enough. (I get that some folks like jumping into set RPs, but depending on how you present it, it could be that you're more restrictive than your ad initially suggests.)\n\n\\-Are you  badgering people for responses or demanding their time and availability in an excessive manner? Do you get aggressive, whiny or otherwise manipulative when someone doesn't send you replies?\n\n\\-Are you too forward/friendly/creepy/clingy/intense in OOC? Especially after just a day or two, it can be easy to \"come on too strong\" in OOC and it can put some people off if they feel like you're trying to get too close too fast.\n\n\\-How quickly are you pushing into ERP elements? Someone who wants a slow burn or story-first approach might get uncomfortable if your character is immediately coming on to theirs.\n\n\\-Temperature check: is the quality of your characterization and writing at the same \"level\" as the people you're roleplaying with? I don't necessarily agree with the idea that people should only roleplay with people \"at their level,\" as I think that's elitist and condescending (and also it's not like writing is a staircase where people just move up and down on a sliding scale, someone can be a great writer and crap at characterization, etc.), but you could be in a situation where you're mostly agreeing to write with people who are much better than you are, and they have figured out after a few posts that you don't have the requisite skill/experience to keep their interest, or they think you're a lot better than *they* are, and they get intimidated.\n\n\\-Post quality: Is it the length you've both agreed upon? Is grammar and syntax handled at the level you've both agreed upon? Are you moving the action forward/making room for the other player's character in your posts?\n\n\\-Character quality: is your character well-rounded and engaging? Is your character occupying the roles and tropes agreed upon OOC? Do you allow your characters to ever be genuinely wrong about something?\n\n\\-Partner choice: I hope you're only playing with adults (and are an adult yourself) since you're looking for ERP, but if you're consistently playing with very young adults, many of them have not learned the skills to talk to someone when it's not working out, and may just opt to ghost instead.\n\nHonestly, if you're being ghosted on a mass scale after the RP has already been initiated, you may need to critically examine if it's possible you've done something to make your partners feel unsafe or like you've wasted their time by deceiving them in some way (and therefore aren't worth the time to explain what's wrong.)",

Not the plot or anything like that. Just the genre. I\u2019m open to any and all ideas in the RP.\n\n-Are you  badgering people for responses or demanding their time and availability in an excessive manner? Do you get aggressive, whiny or otherwise manipulative when someone doesn't send you replies? \u2014 I\u2019ve never whined. Going from bottom to top because this is such a long post. The next point might give the answer better, but never whiny.\n\n-Are you too forward/friendly/creepy/clingy/intense in OOC? Especially after just a day or two, it can be easy to \"come on too strong\" in OOC and it can put some people off if they feel like you're trying to get too close too fast. \u2014 Admittedly, probably. But it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t advertise that to begin with that I\u2019m looking to do a long term RP and try to post daily. I greet them in the morning and let them know when I\u2019m free at work, because I do deliveries and have time out of the office and can be more active once on the road.\n\n-How quickly are you pushing into ERP elements? Someone who wants a slow burn or story-first approach might get uncomfortable if your character is immediately coming on to theirs. \u2014 Depends on the person. I\u2019ve done slow builds, I\u2019ve done it on the spot. I ask anyone I encounter what they want to do first, as to not just force things on to them and let them have some control in what we do. When they don\u2019t have an idea, I\u2019ll pitch ideas from there, but I always give them first crack.\n\n-Temperature check: is the quality of your characterization and writing at the same \"level\" as the people you're roleplaying with? I don't necessarily agree with the idea that people should only roleplay with people \"at their level,\" as I think that's elitist and condescending (and also it's not like writing is a staircase where people just move up and down on a sliding scale, someone can be a great writer and crap at characterization, etc.), but you could be in a situation where you're mostly agreeing to write with people who are much better than you are, and they have figured out after a few posts that you don't have the requisite skill/experience to keep their interest, or they think you're a lot better than they are, and they get intimidated. \u2014 I\u2019ve been RPing superhero stuff since 2012. I had a partner for 8+ years doing this until she needed to move on from it in her life. I\u2019m open to anyone really and do what I can to work with them. I don\u2019t care about their characterization and what not and if they\u2019re a good writer or not. I just want to find someone who is active and won\u2019t leave. \n\n-Post quality: Is it the length you've both agreed upon? Is grammar and syntax handled at the level you've both agreed upon? Are you moving the action forward/making room for the other player's character in your posts? \u2014 I\u2019ll admit, not the novel guy. Never advertised that I was. Never let someone like that either. My post size really isn\u2019t an issue because I can do one line of content to a paragraph or two depending on who I\u2019m working with and what their writing style is.\n\n-Character quality: is your character well-rounded and engaging? Is your character occupying the roles and tropes agreed upon OOC? Do you allow your characters to ever be genuinely wrong about something? \u2014 The RP deals with superheroes (marvel &amp; dc. Never have met anyone to ask about any other comic companies). The characters have sorta set archetypes already and I\u2019ve always been open to feedback and communication when asked on character direction. I have a general channel that fills that role and we talk about plot and lore there and RP in the other \u201clocation\u201d channels in the server.\n\n-Partner choice: I hope you're only playing with adults (and are an adult yourself) since you're looking for ERP, but if you're consistently playing with very young adults, many of them have not learned the skills to talk to someone when it's not working out, and may just opt to ghost instead. \u2014 Thats possible. I\u2019m +21 myself and try to work with the same, regardless of country.",

These are things for you to keep in mind as you move forward, something to reflect/introspect on. No one here can tell you what you're actually doing wrong. \n\nAlthough, I'll add another a few more to the list: \n\n\\-do you come across as too accommodating or desperate? It seems like you're looking to RP with pretty much anyone, and will do anything they want, and that can be a turn off in its own way, since I at least would prefer to get the sense that my RP partner wants to roleplay with *me*, not that they'll roleplay with *anyone* and I just happen to be around. \n\nIt's kinda like dating, yanno? That person who will take anyone on a date, so when they take you on a date, you don't actually feel that special, and like they just want a warm body in the room? \n\nOr, on the other hand, if you keep talking about how everyone ghosts you and you can't ever finish an RP and you're so super duper happy to find someone to RP with, like, that can be a little too much expectation to put on someone after 24-48 hours. They're still figuring out if they want to roleplay with you, so if you're doing that, tone it down. \n\n\\-are you the type of roleplayer who says you're \"up for anything\" and becomes the partner who is so non-restrictive that in your effort to do anything the other player wants, you make them do all the work by asking them to make all the decisions and you're just along for the ride? It's a balance, the balance is different for everyone, but make sure you're playing an active role in negotiating the story.\n\n\\-If you're playing canon characters, it could be a disagreement about IC characterization.\n\n\\-If you're playing OCs in a canon verse, make sure that they're, well, good OCs. There's a lot of \"wish fulfillment\" style characters that crop up in these settings, and those can be off-putting. \n\nLike I said, it's impossible for any of us to say what's going on, but if it's happening again and again it could be there's something going on on your end, and you'll need to do some critical self-examination to determine what that might be. We can't tell you. If you ask people to tell you what's wrong and they don't, we can't be a substitute for that.",
