I definitely agree with the gist there.\n\nMy general rule is \"does your character *make* problems, or do they *fix* them\" and any character that fixes problems need to be binned immediately. If your character always knows who/who not to trust, can see through any disguise, always makes the right moral choice or the proper choice to get out of a bind, etc., they are anathema to driving plot and conflict. But I think a lot of folks just are way too concerned with their character not looking *cool*.\n\nAnd like, the funny thing is, if you write a character well, they can be straight garbage, an actual trash can of a human being made of terrible decisions, and I'm still going to love them to death and think they're the coolest because I'm having fun in the RP! The mistakes make the story happen. And if a character gives me a good story time, I'm gonna think they're super cool! And if they're boring and difficult to work with, I'm gonna think they're awful and not cool at all, no matter what cool things they do.\n\nAnyway, rant over, but mistakes are good.

For example, I state twice in my ad what I'm looking for in terms of post length and speed! And yet I consistently get replies from people who either state up front that they can't meet the requirements in my ad, or who don't mention anything but give me a post that's half or even a third of the length I said I wanted. \n\nAnother is people who get angry when I tell them a roleplay isn't working out. Insulting or begging me isn't going to change my mind about whether or not we're compatible, it's just going to make me think I made the right choice because you don't know how to accept being told no \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",
