Sometimes, I am having trouble understanding who said what.\n\n\"...maybe I can be your roleplay partner lol I just don't feel comfortable with you doing ERP with random people \"-&gt; weren't you already roleplay partners at that time, when you say you far along in your friendship/relationship? You say that you met him on an app, for what? For talking, looking for a relationship/friendship, for roleplaying? Sorry but the context of this is a bit hard to get for me.\n\n\"Yeah, I kinda ERP with different people but that's because I don't have a roleplay partner \"-&gt; how can you roleplay ERP when you don't have a roleplay partner? Wouldn't these people be your (temporary) roleplay partners? \n\nAs a general advice: People who mix real relationships (friendship or romantic relationships) with roleplaying and get jealous because you roleplay with others are not to be trusted. In my opinion, it is one of the worst red flags to exist. Of course, that does not mean that you can't become friends with a roleplaying partner. But if everything is going super fast, they seem possessive or can't draw the line between roleplaying and real life feelings like this person (and to be honest, I also get these vibes from yourself), that is a big no.",

            "body": "My writing is always sparratic because I kinda suck at keeping things nice and simple and fail to include certain points due to my attention span being that of a house fly so really I was typing this while also being distracted by other things. \n\nSo one of the things I failed to put in was around the time this occurred I was around the age of 16 and the person I was communicating with at the time was 22\n\nThe reason why i called it a relationship/ friendship was due the fact that although they were mildly flirtatious they also would specify me as a friend which is mildly confusing; making comments about how cute to how sexy I was to wishing I could ship there characters with mine then turning around and saying stuff like \" yeah your a really good friend \" \n\nAnd no we were not rp partners and anyone I did erp with were not roleplay partners; most of the people who I did erp with were temporary and only stuck around for the erp then like diggity dipped and ghosted me afterwards. At the time me and mr.loyal were talking we were not roleplay partners. The topic of roleplay came often but we wouldn't roleplay together 1x1 it was always with in a group and majority of the time there character interactions with mine were always short and *nonexistent* .\n\nMy terms of having a roleplay partner is different; if I specify that I'm looking for one then whoever responds is a temporary roleplay partner and I take more seriously until they deem that I'm not a fit or vanish. However if I'm just looking for roleplay then I take it less seriously and automatically assume they are going leave and consider them a roleplay partner if they stick around for a while. \n\nAt the time this was happening I was not looking for a roleplay partner, infact the reason i was even on the weird bootleg tinder on kik was because a friend of mine told me that you can find people to roleplay with on there and so I looked there because im stoopid and thought I would find someone cool to roleplay with ( because 16 y/o me thought looking for roleplay partners on kik tinder made so much sense )\n\nBut otherwise than that around the time this occurred I was extremely immature and was dealing with my own issues which is why I would just allow it to happen. \n\n(I dont know how to end this comment because I keep drifting off so I'm just gonna leave it like this until further context is needed)",
