Maybe they like you as a person so they don't want to ghost you. \n\nIn the end, it depends on what you're looking for, an rp partner or someone who wants to get to know you beyond that. If you don't want that sort of relationship, you need to state that openly to them otherwise they will assume you are okay with it. Otherwise, you may have to leave which will probably suck since it seemed you really landed a good writer.",
