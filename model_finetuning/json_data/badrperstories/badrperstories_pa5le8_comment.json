This said, I kind of not understand them? After all, it is the whole point to use your very imagination, and overreliance on face claims stunts that in my personal opinion.  \nAlso it sometimes feels that someone wants to use a roleplay to fuel their fantasy about a certain actor, which i won't say is a bad thing necessarily, but is far from my cup of tea.  \n\n\nOh, something some may hate me hate for saying, but mainstream actors look way too alike in my opinion and this is partly the reason I refuse to use live faceclaims.

Not sure what the typical group standard is.\n\nI have noticed that faceclaims are WAY more popular than they were like 15 years ago. Back in the old days, it felt like the request for faceclaims just didn't come up? At least, not the onexone scene.\n\nIt seems like its been kind of recent that I've been seeing more people wanting faceclaims. But, other than a lot of focus on people wanting rl claims (with the occasional anime/drawn preference), I haven't seen anyone \\*requiring\\* A-List actors. But then again, I don't do groups.\n\nMy personal stance is... I think they shouldn't be required. I don't require a picture book if I'm reading. I just expect the offer to give me a good description of the character. That said, I don't mind if people use claims... But I want to have the decision if I'm going to use them or not. Sometimes I have one in mind. Sometimes I don't. Sometimes I draw my own, but first and foremost, I want the option to use a description.\n\nIf I \\*have\\* to use a rl faceclaim, I aim towards actors, but I steer clear of A-list actors. The idea of using someone else's face is a little weird for me, but if it's like an actor then I try to pretend it way to say that's who I would want to play the role if it were something written for like a tv-show or something. At least, thats how I make it seem less weird personally lol. But I don't wanna use A-list actors, either.\n\nEdit to add: Using a rando selfie online is SUPER super creepy to me. lol I'd never do this, and would feel very much uncomfortable if someone came to me with someone else's selfie.",

There have always been places where people only want to use famous actors. There have always been places where using one at all is optional. In my experience, groups with a cohesive setting and storyline require some kind of playby, whereas sandbox and 1x1 roleplays are more lenient.\n\nI much prefer that face claims are required to be public figures of some sort. Whether they're an actor or singer or model doesn't matter to me, but it creeps me out that a random person off Facebook could be used as a face claim. Requiring face claims to only be American and European actors sounds too restrictive for me to join, though. I'd just put it down to a difference in preferences, rather than them doing something wrong.\n\nThe most common face claim rule I see allows actors, singers, or signed models. I'd say that roughly a quarter of the places I look at also allow athletes and social media figures (with the latter typically required to be verified on their platform or have a certain number of followers). This is on Jcink sites, I'm not sure what your platform of choice is.",

Needless to say, this gets tricky if I need to find a face claim, and there isn't anything that fits with what I have in mind. For example, I once had difficulty finding a face claim for a young woman of a specific ethnicity (Aboriginal Australian), due to the site using celebrity face claims, and I was having a hard time finding any public figures that fit what I was going for. I think that's one issue in general: if you're like me and come up with visual designs *before* face claims, it can be difficult sometimes to find something. Not to mention it gets extra difficult if your character is not conventionally attractive, is not white, or has some notable physical features that are not commonplace among celebrities (or anime characters, while we're at it). So, that's one thing that makes face claims a little hard to deal with.",

Needless to say I found it very creepy and just noped out of that one very fast. I have also, however, RPed with people who use realistic claims and are very good, respectful writers. \n\nWhat I can't stand is people valuing other writers in the community based on the way they want to portray their character (someone on a board I frequent, for example, equated using drawn refs as the player being \"childish\" and \"playing their character in an unrealistic manner\" when there were multiple accounts of them being quite a good writer), but I guess that is a problem that will plague the scene like many others that have summed up over the years.",

            "body": "In my personal experience, face claims are more so to help me than my partner. Being able to visualize the character when creating them is very important to me, so I tend to put A LOT of effort into looking for face claims. This is the first thing I ever do, because from there, I can see them embody the story I have for them.\n\nIt should be noted a lot of my rps are fantasy, supernatural, historical themed, so finding an elf, a mercenary, or whatnot to be represented by someone in the modern world seems strange to me. Not to mention a lot of the typical face-claims are too \"pretty\" for me. That's not to say my characters are ugly or anything, it is just something about art that has a way of being beautiful...just not by our society's standards. And it usually goes beyond that because when you think elf, you already know they are slender, long-eared beauties which would pale in comparison to a real person posing as an elf. In the end, roleplays are fictional so using fictional fcs makes the most sense to me. Using face claims also saves me some writing in a sense but also helps me accentuate specific details about the way they express themselves. I don't mind if others use real life face-claims, but it's also dependent on the theme.\n\nThe only exception I've made to using a real life face claim was because of origins and knowing that particular actor has literally played in a similiar role. I saw it more of casting him as my character than the man himself...if that makes sense.\n\nI understand why some servers (especially if they revolve a certain theme) require a face claim since they may be aiming for a specific aesthetic. I can only imagine how disorienting it would be to have a mix of real life and anime face claims in the same setting. Of course as writers, some are capable of painting the exact look of their character without having to rely on visuals.",

Having nothing but art is okay, imo, but it's the mixing of the two that really bother me. It makes me think of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, or Space Jam, maybe Who Framed Roger Rabbit, you know? Could be that I lack the imagination to blend the two, I don't see why I should need to adapt my preference when there's literally thousands of servers per genre out there. Not everything is going to be a hit with me.   \n\n\nIn my primary server, we don't say they need to use an actor only, but we do recommend that people use someone marginally famous because there's channels where you can spam character photos and outfits and we've seen that people who can only find one image tend to ask to change their PB to someone more well-known later on anyway.   \n\n\nIn general though, I just think that RP servers and stories in general are up to the people running it and their preference. If you don't like being forced to use a famous PB, it's no big deal, just don't join that particular story. It's sort of like wanting to keep your shoes on but going to someone's house for a party and being told you need to leave your shoes at the door.

I mean, I started out with just playing characters with no refs at all (just description), and that eventually grew into drawing the characters because I liked drawing, and even then I'd still play the \"who would play my character in a movie\" game, so, it just never seemed that difficult to transition to using real person FCs. \n\nIt's all fun to me, the only thing that really annoys me is how narrow the FC options out there tend to be because most people seem to choose Marvel characters and underwear models and I'm just kinda over it.\n\nThat said, as someone who was on the Tumblr RP scene back in the day, that site has always been weird about FCs (and pretty much everything else, because of how inextricable anything on Tumblr is from *the discourse*), and it's not a surprise to me that it's become more so. I'd say this is a Tumblr thing and not an RP in general thing.",
