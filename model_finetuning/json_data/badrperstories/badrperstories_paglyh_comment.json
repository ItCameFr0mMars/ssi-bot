            "body": "I think your hunch may be correct judging by at least what you mentioned. The cherry on top sounds suspicious as hell and would make me suspect this person may be copying you. What reason could they possibly have to copy what your character said nearly word for word to their lover? I could probably easily shrug off characters having similar physical traits/personality traits; but it would be very hard for me to try shrugging off someone copying my character's backstory AND copying almost what I said word-for-word in a rp. It just reeks of being purposefully copied. \n\nI am just curious though \\[as I did peruse your reddit profile a little bit\\] and I'm wondering if she's the \"Annoying Roleplayer\" from your previous post in BadRPerStories? If she is, then I would at least recommend getting away from this person by any means necessary, even if it means leaving this group and blocking them \\[as I saw you mentioned you don't believe anything can/or will be done if you ask for help or send in screenshots/proof\\]. It's up to you on how you deal with the aggressive copying, though.\n\nI only say this as I've had a toxic rp partner that I didn't realize I needed to cut off until they drove me to physically harm myself \\[which was not a great point to reach\\]. As much as you may enjoy rping/talking with your mutual friend; you may need to even stop rping with them and just get some space here.",

            "body": "Yeah, they simply changed one word or two but the concept, the scene was basically the same I got absolutely gobsmacked at how 'similar' it was to the scene I wrote a couple of months ago - 'similar' as in basically the very same. When I first read it I felt so frustrated because my character was special because of his backstory, it was what stood him out from the rest of characters, and now she made her character (she already had him but never gave him THIS backstory until now) have the same story basically. Then I asked myself, if I was over exaggerating or if it's fair to feel like this for being copied. (Also they had the audacity to say they had no idea my character had this same backstory when I mentioned something about it)  \n\n\nShe is, but at this point I don't know how to get away because she's a ticking bomb about to explode - I'm trying to ignore her the most I can OOC. My other friend is, in the other side, our roleplay, just worth staying hence why I haven't left, her characters are too special to me to leave - bright side, slowly we've been giving this other roleplayer less attention and focus mostly in our rp, so cross fingers everything stays calm.   \n\n\nThanks for your advise, though! In the current day I don't roleplay as much as I used (with her) and try to not pay her much attention, if only just once a week, and I really really like to rp with my other friend - I just needed another opinion about the matter because I had no idea if I already felt sour towards her and was seeing her addition to the character with red rage or if in another's viewpoint, this also rings to them as a straight copycat.",
