What say for instance we\u2019re doing - scene where, maybe my character eats some food that has gone bad. Maybe we will roll to see how sick I get or if I do it all. Then we just do the typical emoting from there. But dice is not even close to being used as in a game of dnd. But it is fun when applied in little ways.",

Roleplays are just not fun if you're the most powerful person in the room. There's only so much you can do with that. Vulnerability is such an important thing for character development, and for forming real connections with other characters. If a character never fails, never loses they're just hollow. A real person would experience self doubt, or fear, or failure. It's so much more fun.",
