Their attempts are flat and unequal and if it's not something you're okay with, then it's time to either leave, or offer to start a new RP you can run side by side so Ana can keeping doing whatever in one chat and you can get some attention in the other, but I'd still recommend cutting losses, leaving a concise note about the unequal effort, and leaving.",

No guilt tripping or passive-aggressiveness. It doesn't mean you never write with these people again, but a story that makes you feel left out and like folks don't appreciate your character is not a good time. You can find something that's fun for everyone involved.",
