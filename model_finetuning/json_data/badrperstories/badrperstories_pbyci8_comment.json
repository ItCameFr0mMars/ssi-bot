I have it stated in my RP rules to not contact me if you're only looking to write romance or smut, and yet I can't tell you how often I get people messaging me for exactly that anyway and ghosting once I say we'd have to develop things first. That I require chemistry between them and am not willing to jump right into a sex scene before our characters even say hello.\n\nWhat makes me uncomfortable too, which I mentioned in another reply, is when they already have feelings for mine right away when it doesn't make sense. When I'm writing a villain who they would naturally hate, for example, or fandom RP where theirs shows no signs of having feelings for mine in the source material, yet they write them as if they're already deeply in love before we start to write anything. It makes everything feel unnatural and unearned.",

            "body": "Here is my experience with this, the reply to my profile I recently got. I specified in my profile that I have no interest in romance at all. In the rare cases I do write it, I prefer mxm and it must not be the center of the whole plot and happen organically. If the whole story is basically this person has to fall in love with that person, I am not interested. I even gave an example, when the main point of your story is 'xy falls in love with yx' it isn't for me. Finished with a sentence about how in the moment, I would like to do a non-romance roleplay.\n\nSo, a person wrote me, and the first thing they wrote was 'Hey, I read in your profile that you write mxm?' So I told them that sorry if that was unclear, but my preference is a non-romance roleplay, or if we write multiple characters, maybe one of them could be a love interest. But if they are looking for romance or ERP, I am not be the best writing partner and not really interested.\n\nThey immediately assured me that they would understand, that they are also interested in writing friendship, enemies, it does not have to be the center of the plot. Asked them if they could add things (like themes, genres, whatever) to their profile, so I could see what we both like. The added basically nothing except that they like to write bottoms in mxm roleplays. \n\nSo at this point, I feel like this is going in the wrong direction, so I clarify that I would prefer only very little romance, and no erotic or ERP at all (as it was already written in my ad). Again, they assure me that they are totally fine with that. Okay. I asked them if they have any ideas (because they was basically nothing to built on in their profile), and they write me that they have a great idea.\n\nThey send it to me, and it was basically steamy erotic vampire fiction. About some strong warrior who finds his first love, completely with all the standard 'He is the first person that made his heart beat so fast'. I tell them that I am sorry, but I have already clarified multiple times that I am not interested in a story like that. I get an 'ok.' and that was the end of it lol",
