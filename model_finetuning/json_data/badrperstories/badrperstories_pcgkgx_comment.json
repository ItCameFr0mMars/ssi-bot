It can also disrupt the flow too given that most people are not frequent email checkers or don\u2019t have a mobile app to send them notifications about receiving an email, which can make response times infrequent which, in turn, can cause rper\u2019s who rely on rapid fire responses to lose their mojo pretty quickly. At least that\u2019s been my experience with email rp\u2019s.\n\nDiscord is the best platform for rping, almost everyone has a discord used for something whereas very few people have an email they don\u2019t just use for work purposes.\n\nAll in all, it may be worth investing some time in looking for other apps that most people would use for rping/chatting if email happens to be one of the bigger deal breakers. Telegram has shown some great potential for being a suitable rping platform given you can type twice the amount  characters than you can on discord before reaching a limit It doesn\u2019t have servers though, so it can be hard to seperate ooc with the rp chat (something many rpers like being able to do).\n\nIt\u2019d also be worth taking some time to narrow down your ad. Don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m willing to try X, please be patient.\u201d, say \u201cI\u2019m only comfortable/capable of doing X.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019d be very much worth your time to also include the genres you do and the ones you don\u2019t do.\n\nSometimes you gotta be very specific with how you word an ad in order to get people who are interested and to weed out the ghosters.",

            "body": "I think another thing that turns them away might be the reply pace. A lot of people prefer 1 to a few posts a day, not 1 every 2 or 3 days. People will get bored fast if they have to wait for a reply. Not to mention doing the rp via email. Discord is a great place to rp. Sure, you have the word limit, but that never stopped me. I would simply type what I wanted, then when I reach the limit I delete just enough to put \u201c-continued-\u201c submit that part, then continue on with my post until I have it all in. I have had some replies of mine that I had to submit my word limit 3 times before I finished it all. Plus with Discord you can have separate channels. One channel for out of character discussion, one channel for pictures or visual aids if you use those, a channel for plot development and brainstorming, and finally a channel for the actual role play. This keeps everything neat and tidy, and easy to go back to. \n\nAnother thing that may have turned people away is the length of your ad. To be blunt, it started to sound like rambling. I myself lost interest about midway through your ad. Basically tell people what you are looking for, what you are willing to play, what you are not, the style of play, and the platform. Keep out a lot of the opinions or feelings you have about specific platforms or styles. Also maybe leave out the personal information such as why you took a hiatus, and about wanting to find someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind you stretching your neglected writing muscles\u201d. Save that for a more private chat when you find someone. Same with the other opinions and feelings that were suggested to leave out. Half of the ad was things that should have been saved for the initial conversation with whomever responds to your ad and decides to stick around.",

            "body": "I'll do an edit/commentary of your post to make it suit *my* particular tastes with some commentary on how people in general might take a few things you mention, but also please note I am not saying that things *need* to be the way I'd want them, just saying what I believe would make for an ad that *I, personally* would find more appealing and in some cases that I believe people in general prefer.\n\n\n-----\n&gt;[F4A] [Email] ~~Veteran RPer~~ looking to get back into roleplay after long hiatus.\n\n(I'd leave out the Veteran RPer bit. It's not necessary. Also most people won't be interested in email roleplay, Discord is the standard now and will get you the most interest.)\n\n&gt;Hello all! I'm Lily. I'm 27 years old. I'm looking for a 21+ literate partner ~~who doesn't mind me stretching my neglected writing muscles as we play.~~ I've been roleplaying for the better part of a decade, but ~~had~~ took a break the past few years ~~(3 to be exact) due to mental health issues and life changes~~.\n\n(I would leave out the part about your neglected writing muscles, and the part about mental health issues. This will sound cold, and I honestly have so much empathy for that sort of thing, I've been there, but remember these are **strangers**. When presented with two options and one is talking about mental health issues and possibly poor quality writing before you've even met, most people will go with another ad. People may deny this so that they don't sound unkind, but in my experience that is just the way it is for a lot of people.)\n\n&gt;My Credentials: I had been role-playing semi-literate to literate roleplays for about 8 years before I went on hiatus. I tend to write multiple paragraphs (3+), so I don't like to do one-liners. However, I realize that the flow of the story can change the length of the posts. Quality over quantity and all that.\n\n&gt;I prefer to plan out my roleplays, so please be ok with that. ~~I have a bad habit of getting off track, so~~ Having guidelines set in place helps me to stay focused and keeps the story rolling. I write in third person only, and it would be nice if you did too.  My time zone is PST, but I keep odd hours.\n\n(Not much to say here other than I would leave out the part describing your flaws.)\n\n&gt;Partner Credentials: ~~I'll be honest with you; I don't have many requirements. As I've stated,~~ I'm looking for a long-term literate partner. I would prefer it if you would be able to write multiple paragraphs. Please be 21+. I would like someone closer to my age. Please be ok with rping on either email or gdocs That's pretty much it.\n\n(That first sentence is just not necessary, I'd leave it off to cut down on fluff since your ad is a bit long. Also limiting yourself to email or gdocs will mean about 90% or more of current roleplayers won't consider your ad even if they fit every other criteria. Discord roleplay for 1 on 1's is *that* favored from what I have seen.)\n\n&gt;Roleplay Stats: I only play female characters, but can play side characters of (almost) any gender. I only have experience in FxM, but am happy to play FxA if you don't mind my learning curve. I'd like to include a little bit of NSFW, but I'd like it if the story came first, and it happens (relatively) naturally\n\n&gt;The genre I'm looking for is romance, beauty and the beast style. It doesn't have to be traditional beauty and the beast, let me hear your takes on the story! Lets get creative with it!\n\n&gt;I also had this cute slice of life idea for an FxF roleplay based around wearing Japanese fashion in western countries.\n\n&gt;I also would like to play a size inclusive roleplay. I think a cute chubby girl would be fun to play for a change.\n\n(As sad as it is, saying you want to write a chubby character is probably going to turn away a good few roleplayers. I don't think that means you should take it out, but just so you know.)\n\n&gt;I am open to other plot ideas though, if those don't strike your fancy. Please feel free to suggest your own plots. The only plots I won't play are fandoms. I like to make my characters my own, and I feel like I can't do that in a fandom roleplay.\n\n&gt;Please be willing to play on email. I like it because there's no character limit, and it's easy to see past posts even while writing. I've never played on gdocs, but would be happy to learn if you'd rather to there. I have tried discord, and did not like it. It's fine for chatting, but I always hit the character limit. Please don't ask me to rp on discord.\n\n(Again, this is totally your choice and some people do still roleplay on email and gdocs, but it is a much smaller pool of people. It *will* limit the responses you get.)\n\n&gt;I tend to put a lot of effort into my posts, and as such they take me longer to write. ~~I can get a little carried away with my writing and sometimes it needs some extra editing to whip it into shape.~~ I'm looking to have a reply pace of 1 post every 2-3 days. ~~That will give me enough time to write, edit and produce a quality post.~~\n\n(I'd just take out some of the fluff here.)\n\n&gt;Please be willing to play some side characters. I can do a bunch of them, but it would be nice to share that burden instead of carrying it all. Plus, side characters can give a plot a healthy dose of reality.\n\n&gt;~~I'm afraid I don't currently have a writing sample, but if you'd like to see something before commiting I'd be happy to whip something up. Just shoot me a message, and we can chat about it.~~\n\n(I'd suggest getting a writing sample ready, though I wouldn't say that you need to post one in your ad.)\n\n&gt;Well, I think that's about it. ~~I tried to keep it short and to the point so I don't waste anybody's time. Sorry if I come off grouchy, that was an unintended side effect. I'm really friendly when I'm not trying to trim the fat lol.~~ If I missed anything, or you have some questions for me, please feel free to ask! I'd be happy to answer! I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks for reading and have a lovely day!\n\n(Would just take out some extra unnecessary fluff here.)",

Well, this is only my personal opinion; it's the email that does it for me. Almost everyone I know uses discord, some use google docs, but I don't know anyone that's up for emailing rp these days, tbh.  \n\n\n Personally, I will *only* use discord because I love how organized I can be with a server. I really love having a channel for characters, one for plotting, another for chit chat. To top it off, I use google docs for my job and it's really hard for me to stay organized if I have google docs for rp and for work scripts. Seriously, you sound like a fantastic rper and if you were willing to use discord, I'd be DMing you right now!",

As someone who's been searching for rps for years, I don't care to read a lot of extra info before I even see what the interests are. Group *everything* you want in your rp partner in one paragraph. You don't want someone who missed that one sentence at the end that is a deal breaker. Your interests could be a little more specific and the lack of ideas could also be an issue. Having something to deal with fashion in a different part of the world can mean a ton of things and also mean not much to many people. You could do a word bank, where you just list specific ideas that can grab someone's attention (like for example, princesses, sailors, fashion designer). You don't have to put a lot of detail into why you won't do fandoms, but they can be made to have your own character that fits that world. A lot of people do it but it seems to be rare every so often. \n\nAlso, sometimes it's just luck whether or not you get replies to your posts or not. I've had times where I got no replies and times where I got way more than I expected.",
