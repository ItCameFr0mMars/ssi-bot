            "body": "This is fairly common, sadly. You already spoke to them once, so they know you want to write. You might be slowly getting ghosted, and it sucks. Chances are the person isn't doing it maliciously, and if *asked* they might say they are totally interested, but the important thing here is what they do, not what they say they want to do. Those are two different things, and you're here to roleplay, not to dream.\n\nMy advice to you would be to not depend on that person for roleplay, and to stop being the one to reach out first, at least until they show some initiative in reaching out first to you. Sadly, chances are that they won't. So you should go and look for some new roleplay/roleplay partners, and not pin your emotions on that person, and not be invested in that roleplay.\n\nThere's always a chance that they might come back around, and if they do you can decide if you want to continue with them and the roleplay or not (knowing that they are flakey. You have to decide in that moment if you're okay with someone so sporadic), but you can save yourself a lot of emotional turmoil if you stop waiting around for people that don't make you a priority.",

            "body": "It honestly can suck so much. I had a person some years back that I was really attached to. The roleplay dynamic, while we had it, was *pristine*. It was fandom roleplay and our muses clicked together perfectly.\n\nI spent honestly far, *far* too long first pining after them after they lost interest (but if I asked they would always have a reason, or say they were going to etc), and then once I accepted that they had moved on to other things I spent far too long wondering what was wrong with 'me', that they walked away so easily from what was an amazing dynamic and roleplay, but honestly? There was nothing wrong with me or with what we had created together. Their interest just shifted to something else, sometimes that's the way it is. It sucks. If I could go back in time I would shake myself and make myself follow the advice that I gave you.\n\nHonestly I think the best way to get over it is to first take a moment to just sorta, mentally sit and accept that it's done, and then go find something new to be excited about. Join a new roleplay group or something like that, meet people, build a new character if you're doing OC roleplay, all that fun stuff. It's easy to let your roleplay 'world' narrow down and focus on a specific thing so that you lose sight of what else is happening, but there's *so* much fun and compelling roleplay to be had out there. It's happening all the time, and if you let yourself go find it and invest in it you can have a blast and meet some really fun people and tell some really cool stories.",

It's possible they are ghosting but if so, you can't do much about it if they're mentally checked out and going through the motions. But it's also possible that they're busy and have to cut back in their activity. But they do need to communicate if they're not interested or if they're busy. That's on them and by not telling you, it's hurting your mental health. I'd say have a check in regarding where the RP is and how stuff offline is going. Maybe this pace is more permanent?
