            "body": "Pretty much you can't do anything about your rp partners dipping out, no matter how hard you try. I speak as another person whos practically contorted myself into a pretzel with how hard I've tried to be absolutely accommodating; and the only thing that's happened is that I'm quite burnt-out and resentful as a result. Now I actually have to be incredibly careful and make sure I'm not to be a massive asshole to innocent people.  Im still literally looking for a new hobby now due to the sheer fact I'm so burnt-out now. \n\nYou probably aren't doing anything actually seriously wrong unless if you are projecting some of your abandonment issues and insecurities onto your partners. Of course that one would require some introspection on your part, as it's not like I can say for sure where you're going wrong.\n\nAt best the only other thing I can really caution against is being so accommodating. If you're overly accommodating, it may come off as a red flag/turn off for some people. Of course you don't want to be an entitled jerk that only does what you want, but you can't be a welcome mat either. \n\nBut unfortunately rping these days is almost like online dating these days. It's definitely hard to find an rp partner that is going to stick around in the long term. There's practically a million things that are going to be working against you; and you're bound to end up running into quite a few 'frogs'. No matter what you do or how hard you try, you really can't avoid the proverbial frogs.\n\nOf course to end things on a less dour note, if you're patient and figure out a healthy/constructive way to cope with people dipping out constantly; you'll eventually bump into someone that'll likely be almost perfect for you. Things will eventually line up just right. I know despite being super burnt-out I managed to even find someone I enjoy writing with (when I least expected it too). For the first time in literally years, I'm actually incredibly excited to rp and write with someone. I'm practically chomping at the bit waiting for their next reply. I've been writing with them for almost 3 to 4 months so far. This was after at least going through 20+ people. \n\nIt just depends on how absolutely stubborn you are and if you can figure out how to cope with people dipping out on you; you'll eventually find an awesome partner.",

            "body": "Thanks for commenting, I didn\u2019t expect a long reply. First I\u2019d like to say that I never tell my partners that I got abandonment issues or things like that. I find it unfair to just force someone to write with me. It\u2019s supposed to be enjoyable for everyone and I\u2019d hate to guilt trip someone like that.\n\nAnd the accommodating thing, I could definitely see that. Though I did have a partner in the past say that I \u201ccontrolled everything\u201d and overall was really rude and disgusting to me even though I was listening to their ideas. So that kinda made me just let people tell me their ideas from the plots I\u2019d give (if they answered my ad) and go from there. But I know some people would see it as a read flag because they\u2019d think I\u2019m too lazy to come up with my own ideas. A post for another day but I gotta learn to find a middle ground. But it\u2019s also my bad for assuming just because we\u2019re doing everything my partner wanted they\u2019d want to stay.\n\nAfter doing this for years I\u2019ve met people that made me feel like that, and surprisingly stayed for a few years and became my best friends before they ended up leaving. I\u2019m really glad you found the right person for you, going through 20+ people must of been real tiring. But that part reminded me that even though I\u2019ll probably have to wait for a while I could find another person that makes me feel like that. So again, thanks for commenting. :)",

The only thing that kept me from messaging you was our differences in fandoms :) \n\nI know this feeling all too well, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been struggling with for the past year or so. It\u2019s difficult to find long term partners that you click with that stay. I had a really close partner (talking outside of rp too) just ghost. It\u2019s been exactly a year which is wild to me. It\u2019s okay to let things sting! Feel hurt! I think when people tell you to just \u201cget over it\u201d and invalidate emotions because it\u2019s behind a screen, it makes you feel lower and doesn\u2019t solve anything. \n\nAs others stated, taking a break does seem like a good option! Easier said than done I know, but it\u2019s fine to start small! Try three days without searching, or four or a week. Just some amount of time you can build on :) \n\nI hope this helps, and I genuinely hope you find a partner and happiness in general! \u2764\ufe0f",
