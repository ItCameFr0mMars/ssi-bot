The whole point is that he doesn't play himself so why would you judge him for it? \n\nOtherwise you can't solve problems which might be deeper rooted for him but maybe it becomes easier if you reassure that he can trust you and you really won't judge. \nYou RP to have fun together and if you get a feeling that he doesn't enjoy it as much, I might question if you two really want to continue when it slowly becomes a bigger problem.",

            "body": "I also grew up with someone who always judged my interests (just not in a toxic masculinity way), and it definitely influenced the way I roleplayed for a long time. What helped me tremendously was viewing my characters like I would view characters in a novel. Did the author of Game of Thrones (or any other popular book series) only write manly male characters? No, he wrote weak and strong characters, male and female characters, all age groups, sometimes there were perverts and sometimes really good guys, murderers, and so on. Different kind of characters spice up a narrative, and authors often broaden their own horizon to make it more interesting. Your partner's characters should not be viewed as an extension of himself, maybe it would be better if he viewed himself as an author. It is not shameful for an author to write sexy novels, there is an audience for that, and if he wants to try ERP it is not shameful. I bet the people who told him to be ashamed of this also consume such content and pornos and whatnot.\n\n Sometimes, you write stuff that might not be that good, but it is just training. Training=getting better. Not everyone will like what you write, but there will almost always be someone who says 'Yep, that is for me.' I always feared that my characters would be viewed as strange and unappealing, and sometimes, that really happened. But there are also a lot of people who praise my characters for exactly that reason, that they are something new. Show him how many normal people in the hobby write all kinds of different characters.\n\nThere was one problem that often showed up when I talked about my issues with someone, and I think that it is something you should also keep in mind. Sometimes, I was really just not interested in a specific role or plot line because I found it boring to write for example, but when I said 'I don't think that this role will suit me, sorry' my writing partner (with no bad intentions, of course, they were really nice and considerate) would assume that it was because of my past experiences. And that they would show me how it is done and everything would be great. Often, I was too shy and it was very uncomfortable to adress this misunderstanding and tell them that no, I just find it really boring, it has nothing to do with my self esteem issues.",
