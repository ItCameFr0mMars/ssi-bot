Expressions like \u201cI prefer romance but if there isn\u2019t any then that\u2019s okay and the rp doesn\u2019t have to be romance exclusive\u201d or 'I prefer romance but only if it happens naturally, if it doesn't that is fine' are often used to scare away people who are only interested in shipping/romance, not to attract non-romance roleplayers.\n\nAnd if you straight up say that there is no possibility of any romance between the characters, that is not really what these people are expecting (most of the time). It is more of a way of saying 'I want romance, but it should not be the main focus of the story and if our characters aren't a good romantic match I won't force it or end the roleplay'.

            "body": "Yeah, and I think that it also can be quite hard to get it right.  On the one hand, you don't want to scare people away who could potentially be a great roleplaying partner. On the other hand, you have to be clear enough so that you don't get dozen of messages which have absolutely nothing to do with what you are interested in. This balance can sometimes be quite tricky, and there is a lot of room for misunderstandings.\n\n I am the type of roleplayer who can absolutely enjoy writing romance...but only with like, 5% of the characters I write. Therefore, I rarely mention it in my searches at all. Because if I write something like 'I prefer non-romance, but if there is truly a connection between our characters, romance might be possible', people get their hopes up for something that is just too unlikely to actually occur. Some people might truly enjoy non-romance, but only very specific settings and characters, and 95% of their stories are romance based. Still, they think 'Well, I include it in my ad because there might be a rare chance their idea catches my interest despite being non-romance'. In the end, it is almost misleading, so I don't include it at all anymore.\n\nAlso, there is always the possibility that they disliked something unrelated about OP's preferences. For example, I love non-romance roleplays...but if the first message makes it seems like my partner thinks that I am now only interested in fantasy battle roleplays which are only about fighting, with no real (non-romantic) connections between the characters, I might think that we are not a good match because of that.",
