The replies she was correcting weren\u2019t for her (it was Tumblr, so every thread was public) and %96 of them were simple typos. Whoops, I-HIt-The-Wrong-Button typos, nothing major. I do my best to edit and proofread my replies, but a typo of two is bound to slip under my radar every now and then. She was condescending and tried to present herself as a spiritual guide (?); it was a pretty terrible introduction to this hobby. I eventually dropped her.\n\nI also met a significant amount of people who\u2019d shit on ESL writers while parading embarrassing writing skills.

And also, it is rich of native English speakers to criticize ESL people as for the most part they're freaking monolinguals. Sure, buddy, you might be better at your own native language but that's all you know.  \n(To make it clear, I am not bashing all anglophone monolinguals, only those who are dicks to ESL people.)  \nBut then again, it's better to simply ignore these \"elitists\" (elitism from people about their language whilst they can't speak any other language is pretty laughable to me.) since, well, I doubt it'd be easy to get them to see the errors in their ways.  \n\n\nOkay, mini-rant over, but people like this really piss me off lmao, especially since it's not like native English speakers aren't pretty lax about their English in normal circumstances.",

I've definitely met some people who try to say \"sorry, English isn't my first language\" and then proceed to make seemingly 0 effort, but I also know some phenomenal writers who aren't native to the language. It's not inherently indicative that someone will have an issue with grammar or spelling.   \n\n\nI think the only times it comes up, at least for me, is in the cultural barriers where Americans have a different speech pattern and vernacular. I find they sort of seem to circle their points before landing on them, so a more direct person will often come across as angry or even aggressive when they're just communicating differently without any of the malicious intent. I tend to exclusively play characters who are from other countries specifically so that my characters can get confused or misunderstand someone else the way I would and then it really doesn't come up at all because it's part of the character. If I misunderstand something because of a difference in culture, then so can my character, and then those around them can either explain or they fight. Either way, we get character development. Hooray!  \n\n\nAnd again, that's only with Americans. I've yet to have that trouble with someone from the UK.",

There's a racist stereotype where I live about ESL speakers being considered \"less than\" because they don't know English as well as a native speaker. My partner's mom speaks English as a second language and you wouldn't ever know unless she told you. (Fun fact: she taught herself English by reading Tolkien.) It's an archaic way of thinking. \n\nI agree with most sentiments that have been posted thus far; this requirement makes no sense. English is my only language and I still suck at some of the nuances from it. Good thing they're posting this \"requirement\" so you can avoid these people. If they wanted advanced literate, they should have just said that. I've met my fair share of people who have English as their primary language and it seems like they forget that spellcheck exists for even the most simple of words.",

Interestingly enough though, I've RPed with an English teacher who maintains pretty much the *opposite* view - that people learning English as a secondary/tertiary language tend to write it *better* than the average English speaker (outside of English majors, of course). Why? The reason he gave me was due to the conscientious effort thrown into learning grammar, memorizing the spelling of trickier words (they're/their/there, for one), rules, exceptions, etc.\n\nOne of his main cues to me being ESL was my usage of the semicolon, for example.\n\nSo no, being ESL doesn't really matter as far as writing *quality* is concerned. I can think of only two cases where being a native English speaker can begin to somewhat matter: a) when you're looking for RPs with characters adhering to a specific vernacular (which admittedly is much harder for a non-native English speaker to learn than English itself) and b) you want to do voice chat in addition to the RP (not like I'm impossible to understand when speaking English, but my accent is very obvious).",
