For some roleplays, if it's faster pace, I'll consistently respond right away.\n\nI never think poorly of getting a fast response back, even if I'm most accustomed to slower replies... UNLESS it feels rushed, or feels like they've missed details. Basically if it feels like someone was speeding to reply that they didn't read over my own response adequately, then it's a potential issue.\n\nSo, if you wanna do quick responses, in my opinion that's great! Just make sure you're pacing yourself and not too urgent to get a reply out that you're potentially missing details in your partners own post.",
