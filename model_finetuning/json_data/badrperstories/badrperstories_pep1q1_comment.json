            "body": "On one hand, it's great to have a great writing partner who can inspire you to be better. The way I personally grew as a writer was by putting myself around better ones and adapting their style to my own. I would, therefore, recommend you do the same with this guy. Practice copying his format just with new content and see what comes of it.\n\nOn the other hand, I have to say I'm concerned about how you said \"he will frequently rephrase something I said in my post in a prettier way.\" I knew a writer years ago who at first I *thought* he was a better writer. He would do almost this same thing. If I'm not trying very hard, I'll average at 5-8 paragraphs. He would always double that, and I found it very hard to keep up. I thought maybe I was just a really bad writer, when before that the thought hadn't occurred to me in years. It made no sense that I was given such beautifully written length from him, and then when it was my turn, I wouldn't know what to write.\n\nIt took me a month to figure out what the problem was. He was just reiterating what I was saying, but stretching it out with a shit ton of introspection and then maybe two lines at the bottom that I could actually respond to. There were times when it was more like two words. Then I started to read back and saw how much it had happened. Every time I thought the issue was me, it was that he didn't actually have an original thought in his head. It was *his* story, but I was doing every last bit of the heavy lifting, and then I was being gaslit over my length because he made a point to always give *exactly* double what I gave.\n\nMy point is that it *might* be that he's just an amazing writer, but you need actionable content to run the scenes too. If he's just reiterating everything you've said just with more flowery language, then you might as well just buy yourself a thesaurus and write the story yourself.\n\nRegardless, every single one of us started somewhere. No one begins writing and is already magically great at it. You won't change over night. But you can get better, if that's what you want. It just takes a lot of practice. The best way to get practice is by widening your pool and experiences a lot of different writing styles.",

Often a certain amount of length is required to accomplish the first one as best you can, but there's nothing *inherently* good about a really long post. Now if you actually like his posts, my advice is to work on shifting to a new mindset. Because it sounds like he enjoys writing with you, so you're already halfway to meeting all the goals for being a good writing partner at worst. That's not bad at all. The better way to look at this would be an opportunity to learn as others have mentioned. If you like his posts, search yourself and identify what specifically you like about them. (Hint: Length is general, not specific) Then try to emulate that quality in your own writing. If you can't, ask yourself what's holding you back.",
