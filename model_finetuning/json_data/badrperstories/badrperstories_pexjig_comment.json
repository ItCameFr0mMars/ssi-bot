Its never Rea facing the consequences to her actions &amp; actually admitting she was wrong, it was more so my rp buddy like, \"Oh so this is what you want? Fine, but when it all goes wrong its your fault. Rea didn't do anything wrong. This is all your doing.\" I'd always call them out on scape goating Ann. It was creepy since they had Rea become a sort of copy of Ann all while being loved for those stolen traits, while the original source (Ann) was shit on by the whole plot.\n\nAs for saying it might've been their fantasy, what do you mean?

Now it's really Not A Good Time to approach her about all this\" with bonus c) \"well she's basically clinically insane now so she literally can't be held responsible because now I've went and made her not lucid, neener neener I pulled a bigger gun out in cops and robbers\".  It's stuff so the character can get some woe-is-me milked and keep doing what she's doing.\n\nAs for power fantasy, yeah, the I'm Always Right thing is a big one, full-blown narcissists aren't fun to Rp with.  With kids I see it as an impulse they grow out of, with adult Rpers I steer clear because \"yeah they probably aren't going to be great at admitting to being In The Wrong either\".  The scapegoating plus simultaneous copying is creepy as fuck tbh, like it'd be whatever if you both agreed to it going in but it wasn't fun and she just kept on doing it like she wanted to enact some \"my character Good and I'll paint this other character Bad to prove it\" fantasy.  bleh",
