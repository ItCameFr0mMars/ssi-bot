I don't know if it's like this on every forum/site, but that meant:\n\n\\-they could pick the 'best' writing partner. For some people, that meant 'If we don't write everything the way I like and your character isn't exactly the way I want, I will just leave and pick one of the dozens of other people who want to roleplay with me'. \n\n\\-they often had a lot of conversations going on at the same time, only replying very briefly to each one\n\n\\-they ghost? no problem, even if the site was kind of small, there would always be at least one or three people who would roleplay with them. Sometimes even the same people they ghosted, because these people were so desperate for someone who writes the top/dom role\n\n\\-if you get so many people that are interested, there are always a lot of people who write...really bad bottom roles, and some people get fed up with that. So the react a lot more harshly if they think that your character might fall into this categorie, because they don't want to waste their time.\n\nIn conclusion, some people are like 'there is no need to be friendly if you get what you want anyway'. If you always have a lot of people replying to your ads (for whatever reason, sometimes it is the same for writers who offer to write the man in fxm roleplays), some people don't develop a 'I have to compromise and be at least a little bit friendly if I want to find roleplaying partners' attitude.",

Although I am by no way an exclusively dom writer. Not by a long shot. I actually typically write F roles for F/M, but if I'm playing males in F/M or M/M, I typically lean towards more dominant men; rough around the edges, and usually assholes. Although in the cause of M/M, despite the more 'dominant' role, I more or less always keep things on 'switch' mode to leave opportunities open. But their still heavily dominant in nature until the lights go off and *whatever* happens, happens as far as top/bottom/whatever goes\n\nThat being said, I most certainly do not godmod with these characters. Not by any means. And if for some reason I think my character is at a much heavier physical advantage to my partner's, and I'm under the assumption that my character has the ability to physically manipulate theirs no problem... I'm still going to \\*ask\\* my partner before I make any such assumptions. \n\nI dunno. Just seems so bizarre that dom writers are getting into god mod territory. o.o But maybe I just haven't written exclusively m/m in absolute ages, so I'm not totally sure how that dynamic is going.",
