I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI did, at one point, have a boyfriend who was incredibly upset that I wrote a few romance scenes. He equated it to cheating on him and I was extremely confused. Long story short: He was an emotionally abusive jackhole and he made me feel bad about my own hobby to the point where it was hard to really enjoy it anymore. \n\nI want to get back into RP, but I haven't figured out a good place. Plus, I don't want to write with 12-year-olds. I want to write sophisticated and/or complicated things with adults who won't act like I'm murdering them when my character is an asshole. It's hard to do that anymore.",

            "body": "I've always skirted around telling people about this hobby for one reason or another. When I was 10, back in 1999, it was because I didn't know how to describe it. When I was 16 in 2005, it was because it was too nerdy. When I was 28 in 2017, it was because \"roleplaying\" sounds like a sex life detail and not a hobby.\n\nI've never stopped doing it in these 20+ years, but I've definitely avoided talking about it with most people. It's not something that's easy to explain to teachers, coworkers, etc., but you can always call it \"collaborative writing\" if you want to talk about it with someone who doesn't play DnD or write fanfiction. \"I write stories with other people on the Internet.\"\n\nThat's not embarrassing, right?\n\nYou share this hobby with a huge number of writers and nerds and cool kids and parents and grandparents and professionals and kids. You should consider what about it is embarrassing to you. Is it writing romance? Are authors who write romance or people who watch romantic movies embarrassing? It's a hobby like any other. I hope you're able to confront these feelings and be proud of your writing/characters/portrayals again. It's a great feeling!",

It made me feel like weirdo. Then I met the local DnD group and, suddenly, it didn't feel like I was alone anymore. I joined roleplay sites and made friends with people who shared my hobby. My boyfriend roleplays too and, turns out, we were both embarrassed to admit we did one on one roleplays with people. I promise you that people really don't care as much as you think they do. Sure, some are gonna think it's geeky or weird, but that goes for any hobby I think. I still have some embarrassment about it (I think because I'm 20, almost 21, and it just feels like I'm a little kid playing pretend) but I also know I love doing it and I'm happy to be part of a creative community-- dissenters be damned.",

(Sorry, that's quite personal to ask, I'm just confused with your comment.) \n\nAnyways, Either YOUR boyfriend or ex boyfriend, he is possessive of you, little too possessive. And him being jealous of you writing romance genre with others, is just stupid. It is just a writing, it is not as if you were gonna fall in love and date them and get in committed relationship. This is a really stupid thing to be jealous of, and I hope you dumped him in the trash where he belongs. \n\nI think the best place for you to roleplay is Discord. And I don't recommend you to go in Amino, role-players over there... Are not in their right mind. Many roleplayers over only do incest, child abuse (Sexual, I know DISGUSTING.), and everything that is taboo and illegal.",

            "body": "I started rping when I was a young adult so I'm not sure if that made a difference on how I perceived it. The only people I really told were my siblings, who thankfully took it...tactfully. I regret telling them now, mostly because I didn't realize roleplaying was also seen as a purely sexual act in some circles. Now I just see it as a hobby or even an art form. \n\nWhat I've realized throughout my experience is that real emotion and feeling can come into rping, in fact I feel like you're doing it wrong if you DON'T feel something. When your character is in love, you may feel a symptom of that. Same with sexual acts, you can get turned on by what characters are doing. It sort of makes the writing more authentic because you're going through what your character is feeling as well. Maybe you felt guilty because the emotions you felt from you character towards someone elses character was \"real\". It would make sense why it would result in you feeling like you've been disloyal to your real partner. \n\nI think the key here is to draw the line between this hobby and reality. The character you are roleplaying is not you, they may be an extension of you but they aren't you in writing, if that makes sense. For example, I have only ever roleplayed as men even if I am a woman, however, there are bits of pieces of my personality or my morales reflected in each one. They're completely different from me though and I realize that enough to know when I'm writing, it's more so the character speaking than inserting myself. Now, if you're actually self inserting yourself into roleplays...that's a whole other can of worms. In the end, roleplaying should be seen as purely fiction.",

I totally agree with you and I have drawn the line for years and never mixed it up, when I was younger, a lot younger I mixed it up once or twice but for the last 5 or 6 years to me ooc was one thing and ic another. I never really got myself confused on that matter. I have created great friends from rp partners and when muses were shipping, ooc me and other muns were friendly and didn't cross any boundaries because there was never the need to, we just liked commenting 'THEY'RE SO CUTE' about our ship.\n\nI Just wondered one day if my bf would be upset or considered it cheating because I had chats of texting too between muses and even blogs where I would have pictures for musings. I really poured my imagination to figure everything about this muse but I also explored their sexuality so I just felt guilty on that one day though it was never me personally. To me I love him and am only into him, never felt anything ic wise. But I felt that maybe had he read my characters thoughts or musings he'd consider cheating. I talked to him a lot about this and for now I think I should stop cause my anxiety can be a bummer but he always said its fine cause its fiction, and it has ALWAYS been fiction to me but I just felt anxious.\n\nThough reading your comment has helped a lot, thank you! ;-;",

I've mentioned to a few friends that I'm writing collaborative fiction with a partner, but then they'll ask if they can read it or when I'll \"put it out there,\" and it's hard to explain that it's just really for us, a story we're telling for our own amusement.\n\nBut it IS still writing. It's creative. There's a lot of brainstorming involved, figuring out character motivations, driving the plot, digging your way out of thorny areas when you fall into them (and thank god partners can help with that!), finding the right balance between directing things and letting them unfold as they will. All sorts of things that \"regular\" writers do, except that you have a partner to share the load! I've always loved writing but it was tough to keep the momentum going on my own, but ever since the pandemic, I've gotten back into roleplaying as a nice distraction, and I've realized how much I love this little hobby.\n\nAnd, for what it's worth, I'm married, in my 40s, work in the social work field, so, y'know, I'm \"adulting.\" But I still enjoy this hobby, and my hubby's fully supportive of it (and yes, he knows that there are often romance and sexual themes, just as there would be with any other book/movie/series). No need for shame or embarrassment for indulging in this pastime! And please, don't let anyone deter you from it, or make you feel bad for your love of it. There are far worse \"addictions\" out there, and at least this one is creative and helps you hone your writing skills!",
