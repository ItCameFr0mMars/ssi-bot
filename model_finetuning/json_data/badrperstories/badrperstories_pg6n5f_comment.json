I'm not sure how long your break since your last reply had been, so maybe he was just an impatient person. I doubt the Lopunny was the cause for the ditch; if I had to guess, it was more so, maybe it seemed like you were more interested in engaging in ooc than the roleplay itself, and happened to be jumping into a discussion of something he might not have had interest in (pokemon). \n\nLots of assumptions. I doubt the pokemon itself was the end all of things lol. \n\nKind of rude of him to just bounce and unfriend and all that without warning, but some people just aren't as interested in ooc chatter if the roleplay is being pushed on a standstill. I'm kind of the same way, unless I've really gotten particularly friendly with a partner.",

And I'm not really is in the zone for looking for internet pen-pals unless we've got the context of roleplay as the glue. So... Yeah. I dunno. Can't blame homeboy too much on this one. I guess if anything, he could have just been like, \"Hey sorry, I don't think this is going to work\"...

I'd rather a server hanging out on standby silently until someone's ready to come back to the RP, then try and engage in chit chat that I'm not really invested in.

No server activity for me just equals no want to roleplay (unless I know my partner is having troubles irl, I'll give them all the time they need). I do leave servers (with a headsup) if there 'was' active ooc, but lack of response from the other person with no talk of rp (because ooc for me is mainly trying to talk about the roleplay // but this depends on the person) so, it really depends on the situation.

It was because of what came after.\n\nSo the OP sends me this random picture, after putting the RP on hiatus because they are not feeling well. I understand completely! I have moments when I feel like shit and don't want to write - yes, mental problems as well.\n\nThis message accompanies that picture \"What are your feelings towards it?\"\n\nI responded by saying I had no feelings towards it as I did not know what it was. I was very polite. Played it off. Waited for OP to let me know what the picture was of.\n\nOP continued with \"no feelings at all? Usually people have feelings towards things they don't know. Confusion lol?\"\n\nThat.\n\nI am sorry but that made me feel very uncomfortable. The OP puts the RP on \"sporadic to none existent posting\" because of their issues (which is completely fine, again), is not active OOC and then sends me a random picture, trying to make me describe what I feel towards it and also say what I SHOULD feel towards it.\n\nWas me ghosting good? Absolutely not. Should I have at least written something that I was leaving? Of course.\n\nFinal bullet points:\n\n- we are here to RP, most of all. I am fine and happy with OOC chatting until I feel comfortable\n- putting an RP on hiatus is not a deal breaker for me - I would have happily continued the story. A deal breaker for me is sending me random pictures and expecting I will pour out my feelings towards them. To a complete stranger. On the internet.\n- never at any point did the OP express they were \"so in love with the character\" or \"wanted to see where the RP goes\". The only clear communication was the one about going on hiatus. Nothing more. Even during the RP itself there was little OOC chatter.\n\nI just wish I made screenshots of that conversation.",
