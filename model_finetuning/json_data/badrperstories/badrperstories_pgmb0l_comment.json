She did the same thing: would rant to me for hours on end but would get weird when I suddenly decided to speak about my troubles. She didn\u2019t out right block me, but would get weirdly aggressive sometimes and ask me why I wouldn\u2019t just kill/cut off my family members I had troubles with. \n\nI agree with the other commenters. I feel there\u2019s a good chance that she was lying about her age because of how childish she was acting. Even though your partner\u2019s  Facebook may of been super convincing, you would be surprised the amount of shit people have made up. Apparently my one old partner literally lied about a lot of things, including her name??? I would of never have guessed because of how convincing she was and there really was no good reason why she did it. \n\nIdk your old partner seems super sketch. You don\u2019t just block partners like that. I really just think she was using you as a free child \u201ctherapist.\u201d",
