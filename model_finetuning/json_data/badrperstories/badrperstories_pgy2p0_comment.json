They were too busy IRL to RP and I gave them all the space they needed, never asked for a reply just told them \"take your time\" and occasionally I'd send memes and stuff and we'd talk about the same show we were watching. We even did \"watch with mes\" or whatever you call it now.   \nThen just one day I go to check on the server and they left &amp; blocked me. The last thing I had sent to them was wishing them a good christmas and them wishing me the same. \n\nAFIAK I never did anything wrong as we had stayed on good terms but that shit hurts.   \n\n\nNow I'm always wary of being too friendly with RP partners. Was it something I'm doing wrong? Or if I become friends with them will they just ghost? It's one thing to lose a RP partner but it's another to feel like your fiend ditched you and valued you so little.",

Were any irl photos besides cats exchanged?  Someone else suggested irl interference, if she had a significant other and was flirting then yeah, that would've came across poorly.  Deleting the entire character is odd, reminds me of the erp exposure youtube nonsense but that's not as prevalent in WoW.\n\nHonestly a lot of ghosting is people trying to passively Oh No It's Fine :) their way out of not feeling something because 'saying no is mean' who proceed to make a *huge* mess because surprise, they can't make yourself like something to be 'nice' and they can't communicate so they bounce.

            "body": "I don't know if this is more like exceptions to the rules, but it was fairly common with the people I knew IRL that roleplayed growing up. I had this friend when I was 15 who roleplayed too. I was on AoL, she was on Yahoo. One day, her mom found something she had been writing, so she logged into my friend's accounts, blew all her friends off, blocked them all, and then deleted her accounts everywhere. A few of her friends were at our school, and they were pissed at her for \"ghosting,\" only to find out it was her mom. When I was 17, it happened to two more friends.   \n\n\nI thought I was out of the woods when I was 21 and living with my ex-husband. But he got weirdly jealous about pretty much everything (which is why he is now my ex). He went through my phone and told all my friends to stop texting me, then deleted their numbers. He did that on my Myspace. And then he pulled the same shit on my AOL buddylist. Thankfully, it was my mother's account, so he couldn't delete my username, but he did send out \"I can't write with you anymore\" messages to everyone, block all my friends, and get me banned from a few SLs I was in by spamming the GMs with hateful messages. I basically got black-listed from the AOL RP community because of him.   \n\n\nYears later, I found some of my old friends on Discord who reacted with anger because I'd allegedly ghosted them all and I was able to explain what had happened. So, I don't know, like I said, it might just be that I and the people I know IRL have rotten luck, or maybe there's a slight chance something like that happened with your partner?",
