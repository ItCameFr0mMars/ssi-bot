            "body": "I have yet to find OCs that aren't self-insert in some way. It's why I prefer all canons in my fandom RPs. It's also why when I try to offer feedback about issues I have with someone's OC, they tend to take it too personally when I just don't want to deal with a character that has a dozen clich\u00e9s and tropes.\n\nI feel you on wanting to be friends with someone OOC but there is a fine line between being friendly and flirty. That said, these days I find most of my RPs have a very quiet OOC feel to them and it leaves me feeling isolated in a way. I think an active OOC (talking plot or talking about personal stuff, whatever) ensures a RP itself doesn't die out. And as petty as it might sound, the more I learn about my writing partner, the more effort I will make to reply in a timely manner. If the OOC is slow or dead, I'll still post but it feels a bit more hollow or lonely, in a way.\n\nAnd lastly, it does feel like the pool for writers is drying up but keep in mind school is starting for those in high school or college. I find activity and free time tends to shrink as school season kicks back up or midterms/finals get closer.",

For example, it's got soul bonded animal companions, highly lgbtq supportive (usually), and a niche of its own it sort of settled into over the years.\n\nBasically I found my partners on specific boards for genres I was interested in.

The catch? Most of my partners have ghosted me at least once due to RL problems, and all of them will go on months-to-*years*\\-long hiatuses, etc. I know a lot of RPers who would *never* RP with someone who ghosts, with someone who has inconsistent availability, etc., but I've just decided I'd rather write great RP sometimes than mediocre RP a lot. I take the good with the bad. \n\nYou're not going to find perfection, so figure out what you absolutely need to be happy with a roleplay, and forget about the rest. And be patient.

I have to be EXTRA careful when venturing out of fanon roleplay, because when I put down \u2018original rp\u2019 in any way, shape or form in my ads, I\u2019ll get dms from people sending in entire 45 slide PPTs about a singulr oc that they\u2019re clearly VERY attached to, and seems like it\u2019s the only character they can roleplay, which leaves no room for versatility. I don\u2019t know how to say this nicely, but I avoid anyone who seems overtly attached to their OCs like the plague. I understand that OCs are indulgent for everyone, but I don\u2019t want to roleplay with people who likely can\u2019t make the distinction in between where their ocs begin and where their escapism ends. \n\nI absolutely agree that there is a fine line between friendly and flirting, but frankly that is precisely why I would like to be friends ooc, so that we can establish our boundaries beforehand. We may be playing two characters who have feelings for each other, but I think the distinction between fiction and reality needs to be clear. I want to build a story together and that\u2019s all that I\u2019m looking for, if I wanted someone to date, I would just hop on Bumble. I think roleplaying with someone you\u2019re interested in is murky waters, and while I\u2019m not entirely against the notion, I don\u2019t necessarily advocate for it. \n\nI think the well is over-saturated, and it\u2019s just difficult to find someone you vibe with, who you can trust, and is interested in whatever your particular niche/or interests are.",

(One outlier that almost counts I met through roleplay friends that I *made* in a roleplay group.) \n\nFirst few were from a closed tumblr rp group. Next one was from an offshoot group *from* that group that mostly took place in a chatroom. Another one was from a roleplay guild in an mmo. Next one was a friend of some friends that I met *in* that same guild. A few after that I met in a discord roleplay group, then my current and longest lasting main writing partner I met in a roleplay group based on the russian version of facebook.\n\nI've tried finding partners through a few other means when I was between partners and at loose ends, but the most consistent and best success I've had by far was when I found another roleplayer who was engaged and active in a group.\n\nI have found that it is the best way for me to know that a person is more likely to stick around, and usually we do 1 on 1 RPs after finding out that we click on a personality and writing level *in* the group itself. When it's fandom roleplay then we know we share a passion for the same fandom, and when it is OC roleplay then we know that we share similar tastes in several other ways (a certain type of fantasy world, character types that work together etc). \n\nI know a lot of people are resistant to joining groups and I totally get that, believe me. Groups can have some of the highest drama content out there at times and it can be hard to find the right group for you, but the vast majority of my time and experience in roleplay groups was immensely engaging and it's led to meeting some amazing friends that I kept with me long after the group was done.",
