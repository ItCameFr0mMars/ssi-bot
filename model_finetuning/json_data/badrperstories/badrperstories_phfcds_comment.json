You are allowed to be disappointed that a story may not go the way you wanted it but don't let it change a real life friendship. I've had oc's hurt other characters in many ways but my friends and I joke about it. In group settings ships were constantly changing because, just like real life, characters can click with one character more than others. I had a ship planned once that seemed great but the characters just didn't work, we both scrapped it, no point in forcing it. I'd just forget about your character shipping with theirs and do something different.",

            "body": "Jen sounds really young or immature. I don't partake in group RPs for this reason because it increases drama and adds more moving parts than I feel I can commit myself to (I used to GM for small groups on RP forums before the days of discord). Some people want to be the center of attention and hops from one muse/interest to the next. I would just cut your losses and move on and find another group or dynamic. I feel like this writer is just using people to pump up her ego and stir the pot which to me is not worth my time or effort.\n\nThis hobby attracts its share of jerks (of all ages, genders, interests, one on one writers or group writers, etc) and you do need to develop a tough skin and not break easily. I've been doing this for 17 years or so and I'll be honest, the majority of RPs will not conclude naturally, they die because one (or more if you're in a group setting) person loses interest. It's not something to take personal and the people who want to get personal and manipulate people (like what Jen is doing IMO), you need to have enough courage to walk away. \n\nNO STORY IS WORTH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.\n\nThat is a lesson I still have to remind myself, even nowadays.\n\nMy advice, walk away. You don't need the drama and Jen is someone who is going to bring the drama because she seems to feed off of it. I've seen people like her create chaos for no real reason. I also think one on ones might be more your speed. Groups can get so competitive and petty if you don't have a good GM/rules in place for shipping/plotting. This Jen person bad mouthing someone else's character is so crass and I would bet she does it to you and everyone else because she's insecure and needs to put others down to make herself feel better about her manic interests.",
