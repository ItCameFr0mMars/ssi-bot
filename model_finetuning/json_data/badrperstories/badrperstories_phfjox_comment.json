I'll probably just reply and skip ahead since it's evident he's not going to tweak his post for any interaction and hope the next scene is less rushed. Do you think the following would get my point across without sounding picky?\n\n\"So for our next scene with our characters hanging out again and continuing to get a feel for the other, how about we aim for 2-3 paragraphs? That way the scene stays more in the moment for us to have some back and forth and once we feel like we've given them some interaction, we can touch base about wrapping the scene up? Given our characters are still getting to know each other, I want us to make sure they have a strong foundation and the 'getting to know you stage' is such a fun one to explore and savor.\"",

But from the scene you're describing, especially if the characters still need to get to know each other... Nah, that ain't cool.\n\nI'd say he sounds like he doesn't have a good grasp of balancing longer length posts with actual conversations between characters. Either he needs to not be so focused on size, and not work on shorter posts, or just needs to get some practice in... If that makes sense.  \nIf he feels he NEEDS to fill in for length by bringing things to the end of the interaction, it sounds like he's forcing out post length for the sake of post length, and that's not really... Fun. \n\nI dunno. Sounds very frustrating to deal with, especially if he won't even bother to correct it. Plus, just \"oh make up a conversation\" makes no sense to me. Not if the characters don't even have a strong connection yet. Honestly, it sounds lazy to me. Straight up.\n\nI've dealt with something like this maybe once before? A guy who would SPEED THROUGH just about everything. And honestly, this guys pacing just sucked, so I ended things. I feel sometimes people write a lot just to write a lot without understanding balancing out the pacing of the posts.

            "body": "Yes, I do think skipping should be discussed just in case someone has anything else to add. I honestly thought the guy would skip us to the next day and end his post there but it just kept going!\n\nI did get the impression he was trying to prove how much he could write or that he was digging his heels in because I may have dinged his ego by asking him to cut back the length even just by a few paragraphs that he could reuse later after some back and forth. But that's not really my problem I suppose...\n\nA concern is that he might be skipping through the development to say, 'Oh they're friends now.' so we can skip to something romantic in flavor. I emphasized in my ad, that romance need to be gradual and slow-paced. I'm not looking to take shortcuts but I also know there can be times where a story is too much of a slow-burn where someone loses interest because it takes months to make progress. But given we just started writing, I don't know why we should gloss over a basic and enlightening exchange we can both contribute to with our characters having a nice afternoon together.\n\n&gt; I feel sometimes people write a lot just to write a lot without understanding balancing out the pacing of the posts. Like they are just writing a lot because it's expected of them, not because it makes for a decent post.\n\nThis could very well be it. As much as I love lengthy posts, there's no reason to stick to them if one partner gives the other the 'go ahead' to trim a post to suit the moment/scene. I find it easier to add content if my partner finds my post lacking in things to reply to, than to remove some things but either way, both people should steer the ship, so to speak. Hopefully if it's related to his ego somehow, he can adjust his pace but if it happens again, I'm def going to say something and draw my line in the sand. If I wanted to write with myself, I would. \n\nThanks for your insight!",
