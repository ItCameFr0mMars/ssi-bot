I think they used that excuse because they knew it would garner sympathy and forgiveness, that you probably wouldn't try to poke holes into it. \n\nThey should have been upfront about just wanting to walk away but then to try and use your same plot with a new partner is tacky and at best, they should divulge in their ad that it was created with someone else too IMO. They weren't smart in covering their tracks and to me they deserve to get called out for it so others know that person is a flake who is a coward, hiding behind a real issue that many struggle with.\n\nHere's to hoping you can find a better partner!",

I just think it'd be fun to HAVE a story to tell about the ghosting instead of just... \"Oh one day they stopped replying and left the thread.\" \n\nI find it strangely perverse that someone would rather make up a lie instead of buggering off without an answer. What in their mind made them think that was acceptable vs just being honest or failing that running without saying anything? It's strange and sick in and of itself if you ask me.",
