However, I find in general that finding people for canon stuff that fill all the little intricate niches you want is hard. Especially with Fandoms.  \nIt doesn't matter if it's a popular one or not I feel. Most people largely want to write original things because they feel doing a fandom is stressful because of what you have to live up to. There are a lot of Fandoms I've given up on because I never could find someone for it. There have been times however when my (sometimes year) of searching paid off. Maybe i don't find the perfect person for it but I manage to find someone who can fit my needs and who I'll have fun with. \n\n  \nSomeone's out there for everyone! However, you have to kiss a lot of frogs or stand in the rain sometimes to find them. Even if the canon is a pretty popular one.",

            "body": "I remember seeing One Piece when I was growing up, in the JUMP magazines and I see it pop up on the front page of reddit from time to time when a new chapter releases. That said, I have no idea if it's a niche fandom and that's the issue itself, or if it's just that Canon/OC dynamics can be tricky to perfect. It sounds like you're putting in the effort but your partners aren't or it's fizzling out. I know how tough that can be and I feel your pain. I have some thoughts below, they may not apply to you though.\n\nOn the OC Front: Personally Canon/OC never works for me because my partner is way more invested in their OC and sometimes half-asses their canon for my OC. And at that point, it's not worth my time to offer my partner fanservice when they don't return the favor. I'm also super picky about OCs in general too. I will say that this might just be me but seeing an OC with pages of info is a turn off. I either feel like OCs are overdeveloped or underdeveloped. I'm not looking to nitpick you or your OCs! But that's my personal view on them. An OC that has pages of info (like music, different outfits, a complicated background and family tree, favorite animal, other 'stuff' like that) makes me feel like the writer of that OC might be difficult to please if they have their OC too detailed and might not be open to tweaks or have a set concept in mind that is set in stone.\n\nWhen I must do Canon/OC, I like to make an OC from scratch while discussing it with my partner through every step of its creation (we talk backstory ideas, personality ideas, etc) and begin to settle on something we're both happy with. This process happens for both my OC and theirs so we're both comfortable with them and their dynamic. These days, I find it hard to enjoy an OC (mine or someone else's) if things are already set in stone and I can't provide feedback without upsetting someone. Like I said, I'm picky with OCs (mine or someone else's) so I'm only offering my thoughts on the matter. And people are often more keen towards their OCs I've found (which is why I don't really do anything with OCs if possible) and a RP can become skewed over time if say, plots tend to center around one OC or pair rather than it being balanced.\n\nAgain, not trying to say this is an issue with you, in fact it might be an issue you find with your own partners. I'm just sharing my own struggles and hoping it might shed light on that area. If you want me to take a look at an OC or post of yours and provide thoughts (I won't be nitpicky or critical!) I can. But without concrete examples, it's hard for us to offer insight. But if the issue stems from say a singular OC you've crafted and developed, it might be time to make a new one or a variety for someone to select from maybe?\n\nHave you tried any groups or creating a group RP? It's work but it might garner interest.\n\nOn the Fandom Front: If the fandom is the issue then there's little you can do, sadly.\n\nI have a lot of niche fandoms I very rarely find folks for and the list is sadly growing as I get older. I feel like if you asked the mods over at the One Piece sub, they might let you inquire about a roleplay partner, some fans there might be open to learning to RP if they don't know how. Tumblr isn't much use to me these days and I've yet to find anyone there in years, I think I've just outgrown it. Reddit, discord and old fashioned forums are your best bet. But like I said, I don't know if many in the West (if you're in the West that is) keep up with the series as much as in the olden days. I don't keep up with it myself so I'm only speculating on this, I trust you know the fanbase better than myself. :)\n\nIf the fandom is more important than the characters, you might need to consider doing something with all canon or OCs, rather than a mix. I would suggest as a last ditch effort of sorts, to do something akin to One Piece (the pirate setting) with all OCs maybe? Sadly, if this is the problem, it's out of your hands and you just have to keep throwing the bait out there and hope you can find someone to click with. I know it can be draining to have a craving that can't be met. At worst, you might want to write fanfiction and scratch that itch yourself. I admit, it's more lonesome writing solo but it's something right?\n\nI hope you can find a partner you click with and just know it might not be your OC or you, and it's just bad luck. At the end of the day, RPing (or any hobby) involves a lot of luck in partners staying together for the long haul. Sadly, it's very common for RPs to fizzle out and for it to be unrelated to the RP. I wouldn't give up, just alternate your fandoms, be flexible and try to get partners to communicate any issues. In an ideal world, people would speak up before ghosting but without someone voicing an issue, it can't be fixed. And in my mind, if you do get ghosted, let yourself mourn the loss of the story and then try again. If you give up, you'll never find your partner.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

            "body": "I wouldn't say fandoms are *hard*, but just another beast than original RPs. It gets complicated when you have the issue of canons or OCs or a mix, when it does come to a fandom. Or doing something AU/or a crossover and that requires more effort and sometimes people change their mind during discussions and bail before they're in too deep. And then you have to consider fandom RPers have different preferences regarding characters, direction and setting and that you both agree on the setting but have conflicting views on the characters and direction. \n\nWhen doing an original RP, everyone is starting at square one when it comes to world building and character development. Something original feels a little more flexible for folks to suggest ideas and concepts without interests clashing the way they can with fandoms. That said, I personally find original concepts where things are already planned out (like a longwinded prompt with characters, setting all figured out), to be boring because the person who wrote it clearly has a vision and it almost feels like I'd be taking on a role to suit their needs. And that I might not meet whatever expectations they have.\n\nFandom or original has its share of pitfalls and while I don't agree that most people prefer original, it is probably more approachable than a fandom RP. Sadly some fandoms are so niche that it's next to impossible to find someone and when you do, you have to consider how much you want to compromise if they don't check all the boxes. Maybe they're not as literate as you'd like, do you put up with that for your craving? But the same can be said for original RPs I'd say, where you still need to mesh as partners and have good communication, but I think there are *slightly* fewer pitfalls compared to fandoms.",
