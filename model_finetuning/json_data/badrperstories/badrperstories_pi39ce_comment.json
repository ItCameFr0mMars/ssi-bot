            "body": "I\u2019ve had this happen to me twice.  I have been RPing with this guy for a couple weeks and then all the sudden he said he was busy with work so replies would be slow. I understand real life comes first and people get busy.  I would check in with him every so often to see how he\u2019s doing and if he still wanted to continue the RP. He said he did but was still super busy so I gave him some space. Well, about 5 months went by and he kept saying he would reply when he had time, yet he was always active online. His Discord status would often say he was playing games with people. Like you, I was holding out hope he would continue but it looked like he just didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings. I just blocked him.\n\nJust recently another RPer did the same thing. I was in love with our RP story and was hoping he would continue it but after 3 months, I gave up and blocked him too. I hate being lied to. If someone doesn\u2019t want to continue, I\u2019d rather they just tell me so I can look for a new partner. \n\nMy advice to you is to just look for a new partner. It\u2019s very unlikely your partner will return to the RP.",

            "body": "I am someone who likes to give others the benefit of the doubt. I do believe people can maintain a legitimate intent to getting back to an RP again eventually, regardless of it actually happening or not. Maybe the RP is one they do love, but it's just currently not doing it for them. Maybe they are just hyped about some other plot currently that all their inspiration is going towards, so them posting new ads does not necessarily mean they're just trying to lead you on. But it's hard to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say that because I've experienced this type of similar situation several times, with different partners in the past, all with different outcomes.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, it does depend on whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, or not.\n\n  \nIf you value what you had with them, you could just leave the door open. It may get new life blown back into it at some point. But I do recommend not relying on it, and to start trying to fill the timeslot you saved for RPing with them, with a new partner that you can have fun writing adventures with. If I was your partner who'd I'd put an RP on hold with/couldn't post back to a lot due to circumstances, I know I would want you to have fun, too, instead of just waiting on my ass.   \n\n\nSo my advice is to just put the ball in your own court and don't count on it. If they do return to the RP at some point, it's up to you to decide then if you're still in for it or not, but at least you hopefully had fun RPing in the meantime, rather than waiting on an RP to happen. You'll also spare yourself a possible blow of finding out even more of your time was wasted.",

It's always writers block and they need a chance to focus on something else for a bit. I've done it myself too.\n\nThough I have a sort of open door policy as in come and go as you please. Some of the stories I absolutely love and would love to see them active all the time, but I also want someone who is also fully into the story at the moment as the posts are better and don't fuck up what we have going because they're forcing it.\n\nEither way, OOP, if you're looking for a partner that won't come and go at will or like a specific posting timeline then you aren't wrong for stepping back and ending it. You can end a role play for any reason you like.",

I think they truly are just bored of the RP and simply won't tell me, because it appears like they get briefly invested in a piece of media and wants to create OCs for the story that has their fancy. But once their initial interest in said media falls off so does their desire to continue the RP, especially if another piece of media has caught their attention.\n\nHonestly, it's fine if they don't want to continue. I'll never hold it against someone if they feel they can't continue. But the fact this person keeps telling me they will get back into it \"soon\" or in a \"couple of days\" then goes radio silent again says a lot. Especially since they're telling me that they don't have energy to write at all, but as recently as a couple of days ago had written another ad for a new roleplay. At this point, they're not being nice, especially since I've given them an out. They're being selfish. I've given given way too many chances, but I despise feeling lied to so I'm cutting it off in a couple of days (still have that stupid slither of hope)\n\nI appreciate you trying to see it from their side but the amount of times I've blatantly been lied to for what seems like no good reason is ridiculous. Thank you for your input, really! But I don't see myself continuing anything with this particular person. It stings but it is what it is.",
