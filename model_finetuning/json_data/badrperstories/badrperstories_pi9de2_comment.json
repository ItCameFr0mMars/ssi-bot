So I would have given her longer tbh. But, in \\*regular\\* situations... I'd give it 2-3 weeks before deciding, okay, maybe things aren't going anywhere?\n\nHonestly depends on the roleplay and the person. If they were constantly talking with me OOC, honest to god that may actually make me more impatient lol. Versus if it was just silence and then I randomly got a starter reply after a 2-3 week wait lol\n\nI also lean on the patient side. But if I've totally just lost interest after that window, I may just close out of the roleplay. At the same time, I've had someone turn on ME because it had been three days and I hadn't been able to get back to them (of which, I kept them updated that I had things going on), but then they told me they were tired of waiting, told me off, and then bounced. But honestly if someone is gonna hound me after 3 days (of which again, I kept them updated), then I obviously don't have time to cater to that kind of impatience. lol",

The hurdle comes from overpassing that feeling when they do (if they do) eventually reply. Getting over that initial hurdle can be really rewarding or it can be a total dud. That's just how this hobby is. \n\nWhen it comes to roleplay, setting deadlines can also elicit similar feelings. Especially, if you or your partner can't keep them. From what I've found, people just aren't good at keeping promises they set for themselves or others, whether it's \"I want a long-term roleplay\" or \"I expect a reply everyday\" Patience really does go a long way in this hobby. I'd message them about how's the reply coming before dipping completely. \n\nReally, they should be aware that they're taking a bit long by now. If I was them, I'd be more focused on apologizing for the wait than memeing and being super friendly. Or better yet, continue plotting to keep the momentum going.",

Like, I\u2019ll have the conversation about reply lengths and that while real life should always be prioritised, I prefer a heads up if it\u2019s going to take them longer than a day to get back to me. I personally can\u2019t get invested in an rp (unless they\u2019re a really strong writer or we have a fantastic plot going on), if I\u2019m only getting one reply every 3 days. I\u2019m busy with life things too, I work a full time job, but I expect communication and being in the know beforehand. That\u2019s the bare minimum, I feel like. I do state that I prefer at least a few shorter replies a day, but I\u2019m also more than happy and willing to work around schedules and time zones and things. But I just need to receive the same amount of effort as I\u2019m giving, you know? That\u2019s often what\u2019s missing.",
