I don't know if I wanna be around a creepy player who talks over people and hints at being a self-proclaimed know-it-all who needs everyone to notice them. \n\nIs it you or the other players too, that get interrupted? Either way, it's an issue but if it's just you and you're the only woman, that's a bigger issue to tackle. Your DM needs to step up and keep order in the group and right now he's ruining it for you and probably everyone else. You say it's the third session so he's not doing anything? WTF. Correct it now, not later! The more the DM drags his butt, the more this guy is being enabled and I'm sure the worse it'll get it because there's not consequence to this childish behavior. \n\nIt's early on in the story obviously, but is it worth sticking with it? You're not too invested yet and I would hate to spend my time and energy with a group that allows someone to hog the spotlight and annoy everyone. \n\nThis is a DM issue at its core and I do worry if you do something in-game, it's going to be brushed aside and not taken seriously, given the DM's lack of authority. It might also downplay your issue. I would have another talk with the DM and then just call it out when it happens and ask the others if they're also okay with being sidelined for the childish player in their group. But I'd also just leave because I doubt this guy will care enough to cool it and change his ways...he sounds way too annoying to cater to anyone but his own whims.",
