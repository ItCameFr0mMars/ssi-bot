Everyone should get that being offended about that is bad roleplaying behavior. If he wants to write oneliners, and you want to write multiple paragraphs, fine. But if he doesn't want to change his writing habits, and you obviously don't want to do that either, he should have told you politely that you don't seem to be a match and end the roleplay. \n\nBut I hate to say it, you shouldn't be so patient either. He showed you with the first response and getting offended that he isn't willing to change. Saying 'Hey, could you maybe...' over and over again won't do much. In the future, you should rather cut your losses and directly say 'Okay, I don't think we are a match and believe it's better to end the roleplay' instead of continuing the roleplay and hoping that he will suddenly change his behavior.",
