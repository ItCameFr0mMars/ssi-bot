It\u2019s not uncommon from what I\u2019ve seen to do that when it comes to fandoms (hence why many fandom rp ads feel like they\u2019re different variations of the same plot).\n\nDon\u2019t tell people to bring ideas to you if you yourself don\u2019t have one/have nothing to add to any potential ideas is what I\u2019m saying.

I try not to be blatantly mean though at least.\n\nI understand the fault is partially on my own for including it. But I often recycle my ads and add annotations and notes to let people know what I'm focused on. The site I roleplay on the most (the one where this ad was posted), people often have a \"Maybe\" section or, \"Come at me with your ideas\" or, more commonly \"convince me\". Often again, because people usually recycle/edit their ads rather than making a brand new one. \n\nTypically, yeah, if I have something listed, I have a long list of ideas, or plots that I write out. Towards the bottom is where I keep the bullshit that's like \"these are extra things I like, but not what I'm looking for currently\". Something along those lines. Like I said, on this site, I would just recycle my threads and add notes. Again, not uncommon at all in the site that I roleplay on.\n\nI'll admit whenever it comes to fandom RPs, I dunno what the norm is. My post is 99% originals, and then a few fandoms where I'll explore in-universe ideas. I'm not sure what's common practice among fandom communities.\n\nSure, I probably should have just excluded Harry Potter from the list to save the hassle, but who knows? Maybe someone would have seen my plots/interests, and thoughts, \"Well hey, I think I've got a plot for this they might like.\" It's happened before. Either way, despite if maybe I shouldn't have included Harry Potter, my post said clear as day, \"Bring your own ideas\".",

I only look for roleplay partners every like 6 months or so, so it's not like I'm like, \"woe is me, only getting duds\". \n\nI could have easily ignored their message, and very much assumed they didn't read the ad. (so yeah, I'm pretty sure if I included a password, it would have been ignored), but I just decided to respond out of being courteous. To see what their intentions are. I try not to ignore messages outright.\n\nMy take away is, they clearly didn't read it. I thought it was amusing, so I posted the interaction here. If the formatting of my posts is too confusing for people to get a simple message across... I seriously ain't worried about it. It's not frequent enough for me to care to make change.\n\nFrequent? Sure.   \nFrequent enough to drive me nuts? Nah. Not really. A message like this every 6 months ain't going to break my sanity.",
