Are you putting all the onus to be flexible and open to new ideas on the roleplayers you're trying to recruit, or are you just as flexible? \n\nI'm not sure how you can really avoid looking like you're seeking wish fulfillment in the given scenario. At the end of the day, you *are* creating scenarios where you're expecting someone else to slot into what seems to be a very specific erotic fantasy. That *is* wish fulfillment, no matter how well-written your prompt is. A lot of roleplay, ERP or not, is wish fulfillment to some degree, so I wouldn't take it too personally. I'm not above admitting most of my RP is at least some degree of wish fulfillment, from the absurd (being a notorious criminal mastermind) to the mundane (being taller).",

Just because yours includes ERP does mean it's automatic wish fulfilment. It doesn't sound to me as if you're requesting someone do something that they aren't okay with, or pushing anyone to write concepts that make them uncomfortable. \n\nI have always been the type of person who deals with writers on an individual basis rather than relying on specific ideas. This is because there aren't a lot of things I'm unwilling to write, but it all depends on the person I'm writing with and how comfortable I am/what they are comfortable with/ect. It's person specific rather than, \"here is my list of things I want to write\" - because, like you, I don't think there is any idea that can't be made interesting if you find the right writing partner. \n\nObviously I have some exceptions, but I try to remain open. My suggestion would be to specifically seek out \\*people\\* first and foremost, rather than trying to connect on the onset with an idea.",

I\u2019ve gathered from a cursory glance that ERP is not exactly looked fondly upon here.\n\nYou\u2019re correct, I don\u2019t want to push people to do things they\u2019re not comfortable with. I don\u2019t force people to go along with ideas if they\u2019re not comfortable with them, and frequently ask if they\u2019re enjoying the ideas we have agreed on to the point I\u2019ve been told to ease off on it (I\u2019m bad at reading people).\n\nI admit, your idea is interesting, but I think it\u2019s kind of hard to implement here. I\u2019ve gotten similar advice to get a good relationship going with a partner before asking to try something more specific. I\u2019ve tried my best to do that, but problem is, I\u2019ve never had it get that far. Partners have either vanished, lost interest, gotten banned or deleted their accounts before I\u2019ve felt confident enough to ask for something like that. \n\nI have done what you\u2019ve suggested one a few occasions, finding like minded or adjacently minded folk and shooting an idea their way. Never had it work. Similar story to the previous one, with them either disappearing, deleting the account wholesale or just not finding the idea appealing, which is probably the best case scenario since every time that one has happened we\u2019ve parted quite amicably.",

That's one way to set yourself up for disappointment. \n\nIf you have a kink so specific you only know three other people that have it, of course you're going to have to be patient, if you ever get to RP it at all. \n\nMost standard roleplayers playing generally-popular things have a hard time finding a good roleplay match, and you're playing the game on nightmare mode. Yeah, you're allowed to be frustrated about it I guess, but your expectations also seem disproportionate to what you can reasonably expect from other human beings. \n\nI hate to say it, and maybe it's just the tone from venting, but you have a kind of entitled vibe in these responses.

Like I said, it could just be due to the nature of the vent post since I recognize this is a different form of writing than an RP ad, but since it seems I'm not the only one who has had this read before, this is a data point. Roleplay is about communication. ERP especially so. If you're having a hard time communicating, it may be worth considering if that's having an impact your partner search.  \n\nDespite the kinks, one way you aren't alone is that the problems you're having are just problems with the RP community in general. There's a lot of false starts, there's a lot of ghosters and low-quality writing and it requires a lot of patience to find a good fit. This is the case for most roleplayers. The kinks make it harder, but this is just the nature of the hobby. Having to choose between \"waiting for what I want\" and \"compromising more than I'd like to RP now\" is a perennial problem in the community for people seeking new partners. I've had entire months/years where I'd put out ads and nothing would come of it. Then, sometimes, I've found a bunch of compatible people in a span of mere months. \n\nAs I said before, wanting your specific kinks with writers of discriminating quality on your timetable is just asking a lot. I'd say for a scenario like that, \"pick two.\"",
