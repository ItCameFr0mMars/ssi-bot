I *really* had a craving for a regency era roleplay, which is not common to see, and I found someone equally interested. We plotted. We were getting ready to go and it was awesome-- Aaaaaand then life happened on my end. Specifically, I got pregnant and it totally had me distracted from roleplays for a little while. However, once I came back and tried to get back into the roleplay groove... My regency era craving (and all the research I put into it), just plopped out the window.\n\nI feel super shitty about it. A big part of it was just because life happened and got in the way, but I'd imagine if the craving wasn't so niche and very specific, I would have probably been easier to just say, \"Hey sorry for the wait! But I'm back!\" Instead it was a little more, \"Oh jeez, I totally lost my mojo for this\"\n\nThankfully, most of the time whenever I heavily crave something, it isn't so niche (at least, not niche for *me*), so it's usually something in my ball park regardless if I'm heavily craving it or not. Either way, for those a little more out of my usual zone of regular interest, I'll be proceeding with more caution before diving into it.",

Someone will have the urge to roleplay a certain fandom character, make a whole blog for them, promote themselves, get people to follow them, promise a whole bunch of people starters... and then they're gone. So many canon character RP blogs abandoned after a week or two with just a couple posts each. It's so disheartening, especially when the roleplay community for the fandom is small and desperate for new people/characters to write with.",
