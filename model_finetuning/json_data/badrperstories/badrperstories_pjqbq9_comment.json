It doesn't sound like she did anything intentionally to harm your relationships with those people, but bringing her in did create a rift large enough to make you leave as well.\n\nIt's totally fine to RP with her while being part of a group! You don't need to keep it secret, but do probably refrain from bragging about all the friends you make there and how much fun you're having. If she does start hinting at joining with you again, it'll be difficult to explain why you don't want to do that.",

It would have sucked to lose the characters you were attached to. It would have sucked to go back to getting fewer posts. But *dude*. If someone says they want to leave a group because they're not having fun, you don't dig your heels in and try to get them to stay for your own benefit. You let 'em go. \n\nI'm kind of baffled that you said that Rachel ruined group experiences for you. Am I missing something here? Because from what you wrote, all she did was leave a group that she wasn't enjoying. That's nothing. That's normal. It looks like what 'ruined' things was you freaking out about her wanting to leave and then feeling guilty about staying after the drama her leaving caused between you. Sounds like you need to figure out why you had such a strong response. It doesn't seem normal.",

            "body": "Here is my own experience:\n\nOnce, I joined a group roleplay. Everyone was super nice to me, the mod immediately treated me like a friend and helped me create my characters. When I later invited my best friend, she wasn't so lucky. Soon, she felt uncomfortable because every time she explained her ideas to the mod in question, the mod would just answer something 'I don't have any ideas' or tell her that something she had in mind could never work (without even giving a reason why it wouldn't work and without helping her find something that would work). No one seemed interested in helping her with finding her place in the roleplay, which was the opposite of my own experience when I joined. They weren't rude, just very uninterested. I asked the mod about it, they denied that they treated her differently (even though I saw it happening). \n\nIf your friend says that the group was cliquey, they might be a valid reason for that. Maybe they weren't outright rude to her, but she got the impression that they were a bit distant. Maybe your personality was a better fit for the group, so you had a very nice experience while your friend wrote with a lot of people with whom she did not click. Maybe she didn't have enough time for a group roleplay anymore. Or all of the other writers weren't people that she was interested in writing with, and out of fear of a negative reaction from you she went with a vague 'I don't think I fit in' without insulting the talent of the other writers. \n\nThese are good reasons to leave. Even 'I'm not really feeling this group roleplay' would have been a reason. You tried to force her to stay, and now act like she is a bad roleplayer for wanting to leave. In your whole story, there is nothing that suggest that Rachel is a problem player. You should have just respected her decision. Basically, she told you that she had a problem with the group and wanted to leave, and you started a fight and burdened her with an additional problem. Did she ask you to leave the roleplay as well? Or was that your decision?\n\nJust join other group roleplays if you find something that interests you. You don't have to invite her or even tell her about every roleplay you join.",

As soon as he told her he did she wanted to be involved so she could monitor or affect it as he made a new group of RP friends. Then she realized things weren't how she liked them and decided to leave.  \n\n\nWe know they fought and we know the general subject. We don't know if they were fighting specifically over individuals, how they made her feel, how the OP made her feel, how she made other people feel, whether she was trying to get him to leave as well etc. We know they tried to talk it out with people and that didn't work.  \n\n\nThough it's 100 percent true they shoulda just been like. \"Okay well we can still RP 1x1.\" there was no need to fight her really, an attempt to talk and fix a relationship with the mods isn't a bad thing but if she didn't want to do it OP shouldn't have pushed for it.

As for why I behaved the way I did, I still don't exactly know why, but I'm going to be more careful and watchful of that sort of behavior. \n\nAs for the group, I thought the mods were kind and inclusive people but Rachel didn't feel like she fit in anywhere with the group. One thing that really made her upset was that the group owner ended up making making a character that was very similar to hers. Ultimately I think she just didn't feel like she got as much attention as the other roleplayers in the group and didn't feel like she was apart of it. \n\nThankfully things are a lot better now. We have our same characters in a 1x1 and we're building up our own world and stuff which has been a lot of fun. I have 0 interest in getting into other RP groups right now, but maybe in the future.",
