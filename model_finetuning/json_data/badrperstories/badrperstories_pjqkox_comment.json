            "body": "Someone needs to talk to the host. There's a lot going on here, but it seems like a recurring theme that they don't know how to communicate what they want or what they're going to do. Who TPKs or resets characters as a surprise? That's something you need to lay out in advance so people know what they're getting into. And that NPC about to kill you for a weapon is just... absolutely not! \n\nThey sound like a shit host if they're pulling all this. Especially with what seems like a relatively short timeframe. With just the events listed in your TLDR, that would work out to some dramatic misfortune befalling you every three or four months, I think? That strikes me as unusual. Have you talked to any of the other players about whether they feel things are being fairly run or not? Have they run into similar obstacles? \n\nI'm not familiar with the OOC setup of this forum, but is it possible to leave this current host and have all your progress and loot carry over to a new one? Sounds like the kind of thing that's going to end up with you leaving one way or another, whether because you leave or the host kills your character off.",

I'm hoping they adjust their ideas and am mainly looking for how to approch things if things still go bad ((like with the bounties)) \n\nOne of the players is on my side, the others are split down the middle it seems but are aware there are potential issues and one of them is fairly quick to defend the host but I think they are starting to see how the stress is effecting others.",
