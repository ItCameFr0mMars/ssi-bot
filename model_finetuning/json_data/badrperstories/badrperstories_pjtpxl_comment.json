Ask yourself: what problem will this accusation solve?\n\nDo they make others uncomfortable/ try to force them into ERP scenes? Have other writers complained about uncomfortable situations with them? Are all their lesbians walking negative stereotypes who sexually assault every hetero girls that comes their way? Are there lesbian writers who are feeling super uncomfortable because these characters exist?\n\nYou say that they are friendly and that you all get along. In that case, I would just leave it be. Maybe they are a lesbian, maybe they aren't. I'm a lesbian and I personally wouldn't be bothered by someone exploring what it is like to write homosexual female characters. If they say something cringey, I just reply 'I don't think that's what lesbians are like/Not all lesbian are  like (stereotype)'. If they are a friendly person, they will get the hint and stop doing it.\n\nSaying to this person that you think they fetishise homosexuality, especially if they haven't done anything wrong will create more problems than it solves:\n\n\\-If they really are a lesbian, they might feel like they need to prove to you that they are a woman and have that exact sexual orientation, which is pretty uncomfortable. \n\n\\-if you approach others about it, you could spark a witch hunt were suddenly, someone who has done nothing wrong is treated like a despicable pervert\n\n\\-you making that accusation when nothing bad has happened yet might make the other players feel like they can't create gay characters anymore out of fear that they might get accused of the same thing\n\n\\-you might come across as someone who wants their players to have the exact same gender/sexual orientation their characters have, and in turn that would make me not want to join a roleplay, because it seems like conflating real life and roleplaying too much. Who cares if they want to write lesbians, as long as nothing bad has happened? I almost always write male characters, some of them are attracted to other men even though I'm not at all, it's a fantasy anyway.\n\nIf this person gets gross, then I would tell them that their behavior is bothering you. If they say some questionable things, you can call them out on it. But I wouldn't make this problem bigger than it has to be. That would be my advice.",

It's not that all lesbians are the same either but with the presentation/approach it's kind of hard to nail down and a bit 'i know it when i see it'.\n\nI think you have pieces of information that feel off to you but are struggling to put it to words.  Can you tell us what specifically the profile picture is like?  What's an example of something their 'fairly forward' lesbian character says/does?  A lot of guys will write a sexual women along the vein of \"well this is how id go about it so this is how it works right?\" without the understanding of a) they're not going to be objectifying each other solely on the basis of Is A Woman, they are one, also b) they're also girls, they(a whole lot of the time) have the experience of being creeped on and aren't going to be approaching people that way.\n\nNot all lesbians are The Same but maybe you're picking up on bad stereotyping, eg hypersexual any-woman-will-do Rp cringe tropes or predatory lesbian stereotypes.\n\n**tl;dr:** More information required, I think.",

There's a joke I heard that goes \"Are you a Porn Hub category or are you privileged?\"\n\nHowever, since you said it's towards the younger spectrum of things, it could mean a couple of different things. It could be a closeted lesbian who is trying to really feel things out to see if she feels it or not. Or maybe they can't be out so they use RP as a way to express themselves. \n\nAnother potential thing is perhaps the person is transgender is this is their way of exploring that, finding themselves, and so on.\n\nOf course, the worst case is in fact it's a fetish thing.\n\nMy advice is to let it go until it's an issue. You don't want to particularly start a fire with the first two cases on the off chance the third one is true. I'd wait for the proof to show up so at least you can CYOA (in this case: cover your own ass)",

As an Asian POC, I am pretty much always going to turn down an RP with someone who has an Asian character unless I know the player very well. 99% of the time, it's been an awful fetish character with no substance beyond being a beautiful, perfect, sexy trope. Male and female characters, transcending genre and communities and age range to a certain extent. With the younger crowd, it's often anime characters being kawaii or whatever, but older and ERP communities just had Asian sex doll characters, basically.\n\nI know RP is meant to be an escape, but there is a certain point where our portrayal of real life groups of people can become really damaging. Not just to people like me who feel disgusted and belittled, but to other young writers who see it and start to perpetuate it themselves. It teaches them to see lesbians and POC and anyone else this affects through a gross, dehumanizing lens.\n\nI guess I don't have any useful advice. I would say pounce on the first overt sign of it? Be direct. Don't be afraid to bounce these sort of characters and members from your community. It is far, far too normalized to have characters whose only personality traits are \"lesbian\" and \"sexy\" or \"asian\" and \"submissive\".",

Some of these girls were LGBT themselves. \n\nWhenever we started a roleplay, they immediately made ships with each other. There were some MxF ships, but mostly MxM and even poly ships. At first, I thought it was just them fetishizing gay ships because they seem to only talk about gay ships and not about the story of the RP. Lack of story made it hard for me to jump in with my own characters, and hardly anyone seemed interested in doing a scene with me. \n\nI discussed this issue with someone from this sub, and they told me this group fetishized each other and won't settle for anything new. I ended up leaving this group. \n\nOverall, I think fetishizing homosexuality is when roleplayers make gay ships for the sake of making them, without considering the story or getting in-depth with these characters.",
