It probably would be needed to judge case by case. To be honest, in a few situations I myself can say that it was I who fucked up in some capacity.  \nI personally don't respond back to people who say something in the vein of \"hey I wanna rp\". I also feel uncomfortable if someone is waaaay too enthusiastic from the get go. Make no mistake, I get enthusiastic too, but not from the very start.",

I know a couple of people who are really nice, but when we planned a roleplay all they did add was 'Sounds cool!/Sounds okay for me/Nice' over and over, and it quickly killed my interest in writing with them, because I feared I would be the one who does all the worldbuilding and drives the plot forward. I prefer roleplaying partners who are a bit more creative and also add their own ideas. \n\n\\-do you read other people's ads thoroughly? Sometimes, people will not even bother to reply if the feel that you haven't done so\n\n\\-do you put effort into approaching them? You don't have to send them multiple word pages just for your introduction, but some people appreciate it if the first message isn't just 'hi' or 'hi, I'm interested.'\n\n\\-do you often reply to searches that seem rather popular? Then, the issue might be that so many people were interested that the OP stopped replying to everyone.\n\n\\-do you ask about adding something more 'controversial'  or something that was not part of the original prompt? For example, a saw a search were you asked if it could include a specific kink. That isn't a problem in itself, but some people will be like 'Nah, not interested, they don't seem to want the same thing from this roleplay/haven't grasped what I'm looking for, I won't waste my time replying to them.' Especially when they are people who are interested in the original prompt. The same goes for stuff like 'I'm interested, but can we do fxm instead of mxm.' or similiar things.",

Enthusiasm is wonderful, but everything in its limits - I\u2019ve had people approach me and then send me like 7+ lengthy texts in rapid succession, a couple of which may not have anything to do with the rp itself.
