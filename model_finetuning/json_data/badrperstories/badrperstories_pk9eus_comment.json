If she couldn't win an argument, this person would always resort to saying that they studied that subject at university, therefore they know better or that their job was something that had to do with (topic). I swear she had around 20 different jobs and study subjects, and she was only 21 lol\n\n\\-one person who always claimed that she was the victim of something, but something was always off about her stories. For example, one time we talked about a manga we both read. She claimed that she got attacked by a group of teenagers while looking at it at the bookstore for liking it, even describing the exact chapter she was reading at the moment and what they said to her...except that the manga was not published in my homecountry yet. In fact, it wasn't published in any language we could read except online, so even if the bookstore had French or English manga, it would've been impossible. But I let it slide, because I thought 'Hm, maybe there is a slight chance that they had japanese manga at the bookstore and when she said reading, she meant glancing through it'. But she would continue telling stories like that.  I recognized some of them from tumblr.  The first few times, I gave her the benefit of doubt, but soon, it became very hard to listen to those kind of stories. It made me question every story she told me.",

            "body": "It wasn't during an RP, but my sister told me about a friend of hers who tried to convince her that she had the phone numbers and regularly spoke with members of some Jpop groups they were both into. This friend even went as far as to dial a number, and they both listened to someone answer with an awkward \"hello...?\" before they hung up. My sister and her friend were, I think, about 13 or 14 at the time. But it's a weird think that preteens seemed to lie about during the early 2000s... \n\nMore related to RP partners, I DID have an RP partner one time who... very blatantly lied, but did so with such frequency that even today I'm still not sure what was true and what wasn't. For one thing, she'd regularly talk about a big group of friends she had, and they'd sometimes join us in a group chat. And sometimes she'd let one of those friends use her account for a few days while she took a break?? Once, she told me that her mother was a famous professional piano player and her father was also in some really high-paying job position (think like NASA or something, I guess). She then told me one day that her friend had been gunned down during a drive-by shooting, and she had just carried them back all bloodied and unconscious to her friend's parents' house. And that she was so annoyed by everyone repeatedly thanking her that she just went up to her room, shut the door, and put on her headphones so that she could ignore them. I asked her what town this happened in so that I could see if any news articles about the shooting came up, and she answered \"The news doesn't cover things that are that local.\" \n\nIt was just... so weird... so very, very weird...",
