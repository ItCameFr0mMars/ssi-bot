We were chit chatting ooc and just having a good time talking while they were too busy at work one day to post a full reply. I check back in my discord a couple hours later to see they deleted the server set up for our RP and their discord AND reddit account.    \n\n\nI can only assume they had an SO who didn't like that they were RPing and yeeted their stuff as that's happened once before but the SO the first time gave me a warning in advanced.
