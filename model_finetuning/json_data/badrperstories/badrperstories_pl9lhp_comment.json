The messages I respond to tell me:\n\n* Information about their preferences and writing style.  What genres they like, when they usually post, their post lengths, etc.\n* An idea of their own.  Either new details to add to my plot, or maybe something about a character they might play.\n* If it's an ERP, kinks and limits. Saying you have no limits isn't good enough if it's an ERP, which I see is what you were commenting on.  Do you want to be crucified or have something shit down your throat?  When you tell someone you have no limits, that's where their mind is jumping to.\n\nIf you've just read someone's ad, you've just received a lot of information about that person and what they are looking for.  It is your turn to reciprocate before you ask for more from them.  When it comes to writing ads and messages for partner seeking, always ask yourself: How am I showing that it's worth anyone's time to reply to me?",
