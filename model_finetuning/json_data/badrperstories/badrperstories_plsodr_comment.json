People are different and want different levels of OOC interaction. \n\nSounds like you may benefit from stating in your search ads that you want partners who will chat and gush about your roleplays. If that's how you most enjoy roleplay, then go for it! It does mean that you won't be a fit with some people who don't want to chat, but tbh they're likely the people who are fizzling out on you anyway.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not having any bad experiences with my rp partners by a long shot, and for all intents and purposes - they\u2019re all great, and we\u2019ll occasionally say something nice about one another\u2019s replies to each other, but one of my personal pet peeves is when there are long periods of silence that go uninformed. Or getting minimal to no reaction when I try to keep an ooc conversation going - little things like that. But honestly, that might just be me expecting too much.

There's a difference between being friends and being friendly, even though the two are interchangeable in an online environment. It really depends on your definition of friendship and how private of a person you are. For instance, someone could build what you consider a close friendship with you - but vanish when the roleplay ends. \n\nBeing at least friendly is very beneficial to build better communication skills with your partner. The more comfortable you are talking with your partner, the less likely you'll run into miscommunication or avoid them in fear of confrontation.",

Some people do great with little to no ooc at all, some do better with just talking about the roleplay, and some people do better when they can become casual friends with their partners.  None of these are the wrong or right way to go about it. \n\nIt helps to make sure that you let people know your preference and you know theirs before you start, but that doesn't always work because people have different ideas on what constitutes building a rapport.  You've got to really spell out what exactly you want to people.  For example, if you wanted to hear feedback from them after every single post, say exactly that.  If you just want them to check in once a week, then tell them exactly that.   Leave nothing vague because people will make their own assumptions.\n\nAlso, sometimes you just click and sometimes you don't.  A lot of it is just dumb luck.  I personally prefer very little ooc communication, but have somehow ended up being genuine friends with my both my partners.",

I'm not a robot that exists to write, and I don't expect my partner to be either, but it's difficult to respect that when neither of us seem like human beings.\n\nAt the same time, beginning with a new partner can be tough, because some people swing in the opposite direction and want to gush about **everything**. Where they grew up, their mental health history, the name of their boyfriend and what's currently happening in their relationship... it's just way too much. I don't like being a captive audience and therapist for someone I just met.\n\nSo, yes, I always aim for an OOC friendship that develops naturally. It's reached a point where I exchange Christmas packages with my three partners by mail every year, and I met one for coffee during a vacation. One of them hasn't posted in three months because of a family problem, but we chat every few days to keep up with each other and occasionally brainstorm, and we'll be back to roleplaying soon. (I'd have given up on our roleplay if we weren't OOC chatterboxes.) I'd count them among my best friends.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to aim for OOC friends at all. It's just difficult to walk that fine line between \"heartless writing robot\" and \"holy shit shutup\" with someone you don't know yet.",

I\u2019m not saying let\u2019s talk 24x7 and talk for the sake of talking - but I do a lot of my own writing when I have the time - if I wanted more of that I don\u2019t see why I would bother roleplaying. I want to be comfortable enough with someone who I\u2019m rping with that if I were to drop an unprompted spiel geeking out about something that happened in character, or sending them a bunch of songs I think fits our characters, I can do it freely, without feeling like I\u2019m bothering them. I\u2019m the kind of person who gets really hooked if our plot and characters are up to the mark, I\u2019ll draw our characters, I\u2019ll make pinterest boards and Spotify playlists about it - I can understand not everyone wants to have such a \u2018hands on\u2019 approach to roleplay and may consider that a bit much and that\u2019s okay. (Though I don\u2019t get that enthusiastic right off the bat, I promise! I know when to rein it in). \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll necessarily drop the rps I have going unless they do something that really irks me or the momentum completely falls through, but I think ideally, I want to find more like-minded people who GET it because at the end of the day, rping does take time and energy, even if it\u2019s only a couple replies a day. I want to feel like I\u2019m receiving just as much as I\u2019m putting down. Equal exchange and equal investment are severely underrated, and that alone makes someone a stand out rp partner for me, if they have that, because it takes effort to go the extra mile. Even if everyone has different standards and what might - admittedly - be the extra mile to you, might be the bare minimum to someone else. But just - yes. I appreciate it so much when someone\u2019s equally invested in ooc conversation as they are in the story.",

I do usually make it a point to mention it in my ad, and I\u2019ll probably have to make it even clearer the next time I put one up, but I\u2019m often worried about the same thing, there\u2019s a fine line and I\u2019d rather not end up having my inbox flooded with obsessive or over-enthusiastic people. That said, I think not wanting to rp with someone who feels like a complete stranger is the crux of it. I find sharing my writing with someone not unlike going out on a limb, because it can be an incredibly personal thing, and I\u2019ve been hesitant to share my writing online in the past, so a certain level of trust and an active ooc chat goes a pretty long way. Being able to play games together or watch movies together, or talk about stuff entirely unrelated to the rp are just a bonus. I try giving my rp partners the benefit of the doubt where applicable, especially if it\u2019s new and we\u2019re still finding our rhythm. Bonding does take time, after all. But I do feel pretty put off when I feel like they might not be as engaged in making an ooc effort as I am, or as interested in chatting about fun character stuff as I am.

Oftentimes, I\u2019ll let them know my preferences at the start and we\u2019ll click extremely well, but then I think it gets subjective - and their understanding of being on the same page may be slightly different than mine. For example, I always say prioritise real life first, and what that means is I\u2019m more than okay if either of us can\u2019t always be active, what it doesn\u2019t mean is drop off the face of the earth without leaving a notice first. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a crazy or unfair ask, but I also don\u2019t want to spoil things, especially if the rp is going well, by saying something that might unintentionally offend them, or be taken in a pushy or nagging way. \n\nThat\u2019s what keeps me from saying anything at all.",
