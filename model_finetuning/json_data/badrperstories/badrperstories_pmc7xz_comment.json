I started role playing in 2002, and they were pretty prevalent, it just depended on your platform and the genres. But I remember being 13, twenty years ago, and being told I needed an FC to join a storyline based on Blood&amp;Chocolate.   \n\n\nThat said, I think it's just a matter of personal preference, where maybe they want the freedom to look up multiple images of your PB? I've got no problem with people using any PB from anywhere, as long as it's not a dead person. Just my personal rule after someone joined my main group and tried to app in with the face of a guy who had committed suicide earlier that year IRL. I draw the line at dead people and respect for the dead.   \n\n\nI don't personally see anything wrong with the rest. It's like if I joined a group that required only art for PBs, it takes nothing for me to go on my merry without harping on them for limiting me creatively. RP isn't meant to be one-size-fits all. People are going to set their preferences and their boundaries. You met some partners that tried to enforce their preferences on you, and judging by you calling them \"former partners,\" I'd guess you enforced your boundaries right back. No problem here that I can see.",

With descriptions and *sometimes* with art there's an ability to sorta avoid the \"this is the hottest person ever\" thirst trap stuff, but with FCs there can be pressure to pick someone hot and some people will complain if their partner's FC is \"insufficiently attractive,\" never mind that even \"Hollywood ugly\" FCs are usually pretty decent looking human beings in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIt gets kinda boring to play against the same shallow well of Marvel superheroes and Victoria's Secret Models after a while. I tend to gravitate more towards FCs who are certainly attractive human beings, but in a way of \"this looks like someone who might work in my office or swipe right on me on Tinder\" instead of \"this is literally the hottest human being I can imagine\" unless being absurdly good-looking is part of their character.
