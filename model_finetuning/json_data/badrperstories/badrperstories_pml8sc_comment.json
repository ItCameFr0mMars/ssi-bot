            "body": "\\-do the other people seem very interested in shipping/pairings? Some group roleplays are basically...like dating sites for Ocs/canon characters with a rather superficial plot to tie it all together. If your character is the only LGBT character, people might not be interested in writing with them because they can't ship them with their character. Sometimes, you don't notice this at first glance (for example, the plot seems decent and well thought out), but after a while you notice that nearly all Ooc talk is about their pairings/possible ships etc. \n\n\\-are there many people who are still 'free', as in they don't have a roleplaying partner at the moment? It might be possible that the people who are still looking and not already active in several plotlines are also people who are...a little difficult in general. People who are known for just not replying after a while, for example. People who have a lot of ideas for plotting, and then just find someone new and start plotting with them. The sad reality of group roleplays is that newbies often have a hard time when it comes to getting the 'good' partners. Some people are also notorious for overdoing it, that means they approach every newbie, set up some characters and plotlines with them...and then they only reply very sporadicly or forget about them altogether.\n\n\\-some people use the 'character just walks away' thing as a cheap attention grab. Basically wanting your character to be like 'Oh no Ashley, what's wrong? Please, talk to me' and to beg for their attention. It's hard to tell if that is the case from your description. I even had people get mad at me when my character really backed off after their characters clearly told mine that they don't want to talk with them anymore lol\n\n\\-could it be possible that misunderstood the role people were looking for (or they didn't communicate it clearly), and now they don't know how to tell you? I don't mean obvious stuff like they were looking for a big brother and you made an uncle instead. Sometimes, people write searches like 'looking for a big brother with a criminal streak' with a very clear vision in mind (super cool, good-looking bad boy with criminal past/present who is overprotective of his dear little sister but is secretly looking for the nice girl of his dreams) for example.  And if you create some well-meaning nerdy gay dude who got on the wrong track and now sells drugs on the darknet so he can pay his bullies to leave him alone, that might be a great and creative character, but not what the person was really looking for. Sometimes, people are not very clear when it comes to what they want, and expect you just to now that they were looking for the former and not the later character, although they gave you very little information to work with.\n\n\\-did you make sure that you gave your roleplaying partners enough to reply to/an easy opener? A lot of people make the mistake that their first post is basically 'Peter sat in the coffee shop, alone. He calmly stirred his beverage as he saw a guy entering. He glanced at him for a moment, before taking a sip of the warm coffee.' So now, the writer of the other character has all the weight of starting the interaction, making up a reason why they talk to each other in the first place, and if their character is shy or not really the most talkactive, that can be hard.  Another example: I know someone who always writes shy characters, who keep their thoughts to themselves. This can be cute. But it can also lead to them finding out secrets, people trying to set up interactions and all of that stuff, and them only reacting by thinking things like 'Paul obviously lied about (...) to me. Well, that's none of my business, better not mention anything. He's my favourite brother after all.' \n\nSo all of the reactions were basically in the character's mind, and people found it really hard after a while to keep the plot moving. Ask yourself if your character interactions give people enough to work with. Sometimes the problem isn't that people can't answer anything to your thread, or that there is something that leaves people shocked or thinking 'daydaylin is truly the worst', but rather that someone gives them a lot to work with or there is already a lot of things that make them go 'Oh, I have to reply Cherry's thread, I want to know what there reaction is.', and the other thread is harder to reply to. This doesn't have to be your fault. In my experience, it's often harder to grab people's interesting in the beginning of the roleplay.\n\nSo in the end, my advice is: Don't give up (yet)! The chance that you did something unforgivable that made everyone secretly dislike you is very small. For me, it sounds a lot like the usual trial and error phase in a group roleplay until you find the people you really vibe with.",

I think this one is really up for debate, and it might be wrong of me to think so, but saying \"your character walks away\" is an RP faux pas (according to myself)\n\n\\-I don't think this is the case since the role was extremely open. She just said that there was an opening here and there was no personality, no traits, no nothing outlined. So it could be that my character wasn't what she envisioned but if so then I could never have known about it.\n\n\\-Yes! If I do say so myself lol. There's no way I can prove this to you but I believe I'm always conscious of giving other RPers things to work with.\n\nThanks for the advice &lt;3 I'll stick it out for a little bit.

Think about interactions you have in real life; they are all sorts of varying lengths and depth of conversation, but sometimes in a roleplay it feels like people aren't willing to have a sort of relatively 'brief' encounter that establishes that the two have met, but that doesn't spiral off into a whole *thing.* \n\nSometimes two people will talk, and then one remembers they need to go do something, so they take their leave.
