            "body": "Cutting the fandom aspect out, since I cannot speak on it since I do not do fandom roleplay...\n\nI've got mixed feelings on doubling. I've tried to play the doubling game as a constant, so that more itches can be scratched AND it does help build the world (the two roleplays MUST connect somehow for me to see a point in doing it), but sometimes it can feel tiring: this 100% has to do with the fact that, sometimes my muse to play one character is a lot stronger than the other character, but I don't want it to feel like I'm half assing the other side. It just makes burnout a higher risk.\n\nA 500 word count per side doesn't bug me so much, as I can average 500-1000 words anyway for slower paced roleplays(non-doubled), although if I am doubling, it does make it easier if I'm steering closer to 250-500 words per side to help against the burnout. But, word count requirements are something I only come across every now and again whenever I'm roleplaying with someone who wants to double. At least, on the site where I find most of my partners anyway. Stricter requirements I may just have to pass on if it's doubling.\n\nBut, despite my complaints, sometimes I really do enjoy doubling. It can be a more than a 'I scratch your back, you scratch mine', if things are meshing properly. Then it can turn into better world building, and crafting a cast. Easier plotting. Just a lot more potential imo, but I just gotta be in the mood for the bigger workload.\n\nMy preferred alternative is building a cast as we go. Maybe starting with one core pairing, and introduce more characters. Pair them up organically (both romantically, platonically, or more conflicting relationships). From there, if things really grow, sometimes we'll straight up turn it into a doubling situation. Those side characters are now major characters, and perhaps a new pairing is rolling in along at the same pace as the original pairing, or we'll switch them out as the scene fits. &lt;- This situation doesn't happen all too often, but it's very rewarding whenever it does.\n\ntl;dr I enjoy the possibilities doubling brings, as I love a big cast of characters, but sometimes feeling obligated to play two sets at once at all times is tiring and can make me burn out faster.",

I have a few partners in the mix who just enjoy the same things I do, and I\u2019m patient. I did doubling once, the roleplayer was a good writer and neither  of us cheaped out on the other\u2019s story but I found myself having an incredibly difficult time getting invested in their story. I would write out the post and dot all the i\u2019s and cross all the t\u2019s but my heart wasn\u2019t in it, so it felt like a chore. Never again. \n\nThe length thing is it\u2019s own ball of wax. A not-insignificant number of role players have this problem where they mistake long posts for good posts. I\u2019m a multi-para to novella length writer and I have a running joke with a couple of my partners where one of us will suggest moving from longer posts to something shorter and more rapid for a period of time and I\u2019m always the one who breaks that streak. I say this because I\u2019m someone who tends to write long posts, but the idea that all posts should be long is silly. I\u2019ve written 2000 word posts, and I\u2019ve written one liners. Both have their place. \n\nThe length requirements probably are there to ward off low-effort roleplayers and aren\u2019t a hard and fast rule, but it\u2019s still pretty annoying.",

I consider myself 'lazy lit' (or the term I see around these days), where I write what is necessary on a post by post basis. This might be 200 words, it might be 1200. I don't like the idea of making a SET RULE of minimum size requirements, but I also would rather try and ward off low-effort people if I can.

Type what needs to be said, not too much nor too little. Nobody wants a partner that requires you to write an essay on what a fucking soup spoon feels like!\n\nIf someone is drawing out the description of a spoon in a long roleplay post... They're probably doing it wrong, or padding out their posts for the wrong reason. No one who wants to do long form roleplay wants unimportant descriptions of spoons or eating breakfast.\n\nNow. Kissing somebody? *That* is easily something that can be drawn out in one, or two paragraphs. A kiss likely will entice emotion out of the characters. Or if it's a NSFW scene... Entice a lot more than just emotion, or bring out a physical reaction and response. People don't care about paragraphs about spoons, but a paragraph of describe a kiss can be much more enriching than, \"They kissed\", or \"He kissed her\".\n\nOf course. Not EVERY kissing incident would need a drawn out, but a kissing scene is the perfect example of what is perfectly acceptable to go into detail over. Be it emotional details, or getting heavy into description.",

            "body": "As some other people have said, there's multiple issues going on in your post. Doubling up, post lengths, etc.   \n\n\nPersonally I'm against doubling up. I'm guilty of being picky with my partners. I know what I want and how I want it. For example, you mentioned on reply a week. If it took my roleplays a week to get replies without any ooc talk of stuff going on, I'd just assume they aren't actually all that interested in RPing. And feeling like I'm a back burner RP for when they're bored isn't something I enjoy or want. Where as you are fine with it.  \n\n\nThem having their own requirements and being upfront about it isn't necessarily bad. Though I do think post count is a bit of a weird one. So long as I'm not getting extremely short posts with nothing really to build a response off of I don't mind minimum lengths. You can have quality roleplays be only a semi paragraph if you're giving rapid responses to move a scene along at a good pace. Making a minimum requirement too long sounds like a recipe for fluff.  I enjoy some superfluous detail to flesh out the surroundings of a scene or actions in it as much as the next. But if you make a minimum too long it goes from being \"some nice detailing\" to being \"The same detail mentioned in slightly different ways over and over\". It's almost an elitist mentality to require people to have novella capabilities. (Not that I think 15 lines is novella in truth.) Again that's my opinion though and I can see the issue especially if you're doubling up.   \n\n\nAs for doubling up, I just don't enjoy it. I can play multiple characters in a roleplay, most often times I DO in fact play many. Still, I have ONE main who would be the focus of any romance or pairing going on typically. I have a single partner who I would double up for if they wanted me to and they never ask me to and I've had them as a partner for years. At the end of the day doubling up is a recipe for someone to feel cheated or neglected if one rp or pairing gets more attention than the other. I'd rather spend more time being picky and looking for someone who is actively looking to play what I'm actively seeking to play with. For example, in Jujutsu Kaisen roleplays or Genshin Impact roleplays I'd want to pair my OC with a specific canon character and I'd look for a partner who wants to play that canon character. (This isn't to say I never do OC x OC but I'm just giving an example of how specific I am when looking for something in particular.)   \n\n\nI find it's better to struggle a longer time to find a partner that meshes with you better than it is to settle for someone who will in turn be settling along side you.  In a time of ghosting being rampant and a lack of basic decency, manners and communication between partners I find it's best not to RP with people you settle on or that are settling on you. Which is all doubling up is I feel. Because then say you do that and everything's okay even. A fair exchange of time is happening in both RPs. The whole time you're RPing though, your partner is looking for someone to fulfil the roleplay in a more ideal way or way where they don't have to double up and then they find them. Well there goes your spot with them and you're slid to the back burner because now they have everything they want in the other partner and you're simply there when the other partner is busy. People shouldn't be afraid to be greedy and picky when it comes to who they RP with. Anytime I see a post that says \"double\" anywhere in its description I just close it out right away unless it's a set up where I know it won't be necessary.   \n\n\nLooping back around to the speed of the responses, that just leads me back to you being greedier. Don't reach out to people that want faster or slower responses than you want if you're the one reaching out. And if you're the one posting an ad be clear. It's one thing for you to start an RP and life come up and things slow down for a bit. That will always happen, but it's another if you settle on a partner who doesn't post a length or speed you want and then end up in an RP that you don't want to be in or that can't hold your interest, or makes your partner end up feeling that way too. @.@ I'm sorry this is such a long response.",

It's the same reason that I don't really vibe with \"lazy lit\" as a description. It continuously reinforces this sort of elitist fixation the roleplay community has on length. My posts aren't *lazy* just because they're not always novellas. Regardless of how long my posts are, each time I reply to my partner I am building the world and further evolving the conflict. This takes more work than just writing a long post.\n\nI've met writers who can do all of the above *concisely*, and I've met writers who can blather on for ten paragraphs and somehow in all that time fail to develop the conflict or deepen the character interaction further. That someone *can* write 500 word replies doesn't tell me if they can write good replies; it tells me they can write long replies. Some of the best writers I've ever roleplayed with have told me they don't respond to ads with set word counts for this exact reason, despite the fact that they can easily meet those requirements.",

            "body": "I really do love doubling up. It\u2019s the only way I do fandom roleplays. It helps me get my fix for a fandom without feeling like I\u2019m taking advantage of someone. But I also write my posts evenly so that both our characters feel like they\u2019re equal.\n\nI\u2019ve had selfish rp partners who will write 42 lines for their oc and barely give my character anything to work with. I\u2019ve also had really good partners that are more fair. \n\nMy biggest problem with doubling up is the amount of Mary Sue ocs you have to sift through. Like for one Hobbit rp this one rp partner had an oc who was a literal dragon tamer. Completely over powered for the world and story. \n\nIt can get frustrating but I feel guilty asking for a single rp with someone playing my favorite cannon character. I\u2019m not really one for ships, can\u2019t explain why, I\u2019ll read fan fiction about them but I don\u2019t like rping them. Unless it\u2019s like a video game where the character is a self insert like mass effect or dragon age. \n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong way to rp. As long as you and your partner are having fun, which is the entire point, who cares how other people rp.",
