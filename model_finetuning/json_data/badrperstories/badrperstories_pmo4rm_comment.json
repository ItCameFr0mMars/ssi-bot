I won't be *mean* to people who don't meet my 'standards', but I may also not be particularly interested in writing with them. I have a finite amount of time and energy to roleplay with and I want to spend that time and energy writing roleplay that I find satisfying.\n\nYou *can't* write with everyone, and it's okay to gravitate towards people who write with you in a way that is gratifying. This does not only for the longform writers that spend hours writing and editing a reply, but also for people who like brief, fast replies that keep a lot of dynamic energy in a scene that moves quickly.\n\nNow, if people were rude or insulting to you, then fuck em they're assholes. And yeah, some people are elitist and pricks about it, but if they just don't want to roleplay with you or are more reserved, that doesn't mean they are toxic.",

            "body": "Hm, I'm always a bit torn when it comes to this topic. If someone tells me 'Hey, I'm not a good writer/just started roleplaying and am not very secure in my writing, but I really want to write a roleplay and I'm trying my best.' I will give them a chance. \n\nBut sometimes, people who are just...lazy or rude approach you. People who write oneliners and reply to ads who are searching for advanced literate writers, and then throw a tantrum about those 'damn elitists' when you turn them down. People who basically reply to every advice you give them with 'Well, I'm new, so how can you criticize me?' so of course, nothing ever gets better. People who are very insecure and basically answer to every minor piece of advice by saying 'Oh, sorry. I didn't know that my writing sucks that much. I should quit roleplaying altogether.' so you have to constantly reassure them and can't point out any issues with the roleplay because you don't want them to have nervous breakdown. And then there are the people who are just plain rude like 'Yeah, my grammar and spelling is bad, what are you gonna do about it? Wait, you don't want to roleplay with me anymore? How toxic!' And honestly, I can understand every writer who thinks to themselves 'Nah, I'm not teaching anyone how to roleplay anymore.' \n\nIt's their hobby as well. See it this way: people who teach newbies/bad roleplayers  how to roleplay put in a lot of effort, and sometimes even put their own fun last (because it can be pretty unsatisifying to roleplay with inexperienced people, at least until they get better). Often, they don't even get as much as thank you. If you really unlucky, you get harassed, called a bad guy who made them quit roleplaying (although they ask you for advice), or just ghosted after you did a lot to help them. Sure, you can met pretty cool and fun people doing that, but some people are really, really rude. \n\nIgnoring someone isn't nice, but I also understand that not everyone wants to write with newbies. Now, people should never insult or mock people's writing skills, or be rude to them. That definitely is toxic. And excluding someone without telling what the issue is is also bad roleplaying behavior.",
