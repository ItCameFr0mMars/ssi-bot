If a person you barely know ghosts you, it's inconvenient and discouraging, but not the end of the world.\n\nAll that to say, he may or may not be ghosting. But I do know this: I can be at work all day, and every time I pick up my phone and look at it, my Discord makes me appear to pop online. I may even peek at it, but don't want to reply to certain messages. Just because he's \"online\" but not messaging does not mean he's never going to respond!\n\nSometimes people need to get comfy and reach a place (physically) where they can unwind and respond. Try not to look at the friends list so often if it's causing distress. He'll respond, or he won't -- but checking to see if he's been online won't help you out either way.",

Or sometimes, I have a really bad migraine that makes it hard to focus, and I might come online for short periods time to read if have any new messages, but don't reply immediately. Maybe they are just busy because they went to the cinema with friends. Maybe not replying for one day and then replying a lot again is their normal reply frequency, and you haven't noticed because you only have written for such a short time. Or they want to finish working on their character (this can take time) before they reply ooc again, because they don't want to get sidetracked.
