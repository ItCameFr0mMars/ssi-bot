Pokemon is one of my great joys and it's easier to connect and make friends with it than say Marvel or DC where most I meet either watch movies exclusively, or watch CW shows(Which I don't as I can't stand sappy teen drama so I'm completely clueless if they want to pair against Green Arrow or Flash from that show :/ )",

That seems to be where a lot of the roleplaying has moved to, which will help you cast a wider net.\n\nI don't think being 19 should make it difficult to find partners unless you're intentionally seeking out older people to roleplay with instead of college-aged roleplayers. \n\nAs someone who also has a strong personality (though, granted, there are multiple meanings of this and I'm not quite sure which one you mean...I'm very intense and 0-100 with my opinions/feelings), I'd advise you to learn to moderate that a little bit more with new acquaintances. When I was younger I definitely had that \"it's their problem if they can't handle me\" perspective, but you gotta learn to adopt some first-date behavior if you think you're coming on too strong. It's a good life skill to have, and it's not so much about changing who *you* are than learning to be considerate of other people and offer them the social space to be comfortable, too.",

Like if they say hi I\u2019ll be like EYYY WELCOME WELCOME !! It just seems like not a lot of people know how to respond to that. \n\nI actually befriended someone once and I\u2019m generally SUPER friendly. I gave them a toyhouse invite code (character storage website) and even invited them to my Minecraft realm. We clicked really well and I thought we were just vibing off of each other but they said things were moving too fast. I was pretty saddened by this because afaik all I did was return their energy and just try to be their friend. That\u2019s the biggest thing that kinda scared me into toning myself down, though I\u2019m still unsure of what exactly I did wrong.",

            "body": "Discord has lots of different hubs, so you may want to give it another shot.\n\nI'm going to first say your anxiety is warranted. Especially at a young age like yours, it can be hard to be sure the people in your peer group are legal adults, since you are still so close in proximity to being a minor.\n\nHaving said that, you may want to consider why this practice is treated with suspicions. You are effectively soliciting personally identifying information from strangers in the interest of writing some spanky stuff on the internet. The only way to ensure this is effective is if you have the tools to basically dox the person you're writing with.\n\nFurthermore, you do not have a credible way of verifying that the ID you've received belongs to the person who sent it to you, nor can you necessarily verify that you are the owner of the ID you've submitted without violating boundaries further. Photoshop exists and can pretty easily change the date on an ID, and so you could be roleplaying with minors who have gone an extra step to lie to you about their age. I'm not sure this is quite the magic bullet you think it is.\n\nUnfortunately, I also really don't have a solution, short of developing a very good instinct for who is still in high school.\n\nIt gets easier with age. Nowadays the life-experience-gap between me and people in their mid-20s makes it hard for me to want to roleplay with them, to say nothing of literal teenagers. (Teenagers and people in their mid-20s aren't doing anything *wrong* by not magically having the life experience of someone older than them, but in the same way I wouldn't want to hang out with or date an 18-year-old, I also wouldn't want to start up a roleplay with them. We're at different places in our lives.)",

            "body": "If you see people who list red flags, appearing 'overly enthusiastic' is often one of them. This isn't because being friendly or trying to make friends is a bad thing. Some people are not looking for friends, they really just want to roleplay. But even if people do want to make friends, it's super important that they get the feeling 'This is happening naturally, because we're such a good match.' and not 'I feel like I have to be friends with this person, because they did a lot for me and already mentioned three times that we already are friends.' \n\nIf someone tells you that you're moving too fast, it might be possible that you overlooked a boundary, or that when you joked about friendship, they didn't realize that it was indeed just a joke. It takes a while to know the other person, and if people already act overly enthusiastic and as if we are best friends a week after we started writing, I'm overwhelmed and don't know how to react. It puts a lot of pressure on the other person, and it also makes them feel like 'They can't know me like that already, something feels fake/as if they might have ulterior motives.' For me, friendship is something that happens after a lot of time. Maybe if we already chatted for two months or even more and are really close, I will call them you a friend. Now, you might define friendship differently, but if you talk about friendship and calling other people friends too soon, that can be a bit off-putting.\n\nHere are some examples: While searching for a roleplay, a girl contacted me. She was nice, and our interests seemed to match. We chatted a bit ooc, and the vibe was fine. Sure, there were some things that didn't quite match (for example our taste in literature), but overall, she seemed super nice. We chatted for the whole evening, and she wrote me something about how glad she was that she finally found someone as perfect as me, and she often made it seem like we are totally compatible and soon to be friends. That was a little strange, because while I thought she was nice, I was still very much in the 'I can't really tell if we vibe, I still know very little about this person.' The next day, she showered me with praise, but a problem occurred: I disliked a TV show she liked, and she reacted very badly to that, belittling me, telling me I was just not clever enough to get it. Basically, something that could have been 'That's fine, I understand not everyone likes superhero shows. Let's chat about (...)' turned into a lecture, because she was already very set on the whole 'We are gonna be best friends, we understand each other so well.' mindset. But after that, she changed topics, and again, a lot of praise and telling me how perfect we for each other. I always just answered with something like 'Oh, it's so nice that you would say that.' because I couldn't tell (yet) if we were truly as compatible. Not even a couple hours later, she wanted me to design something very personal for her, because she wanted the design to be made by someone who 'means a lot to her'. This escalated even more, made me very uncomfortable, and finally after something  worse happened the next day, I told her that this is too much and I'm not interested in writing with her any longer. Basically, I was still in the 'Do I truly find this girl nice/do we vibe?' phase, and she treated me as her best friends after and handful of days and acted like we were soul mates.\n\nA friend of mine met a guy who, after a week of very casual chatting ooc, told her that she is the only one who truly understands him and if she wouldn't be there for him, he might lose his will to live. For her, he was...some guy who she casually chatted with for a week, and he told her that she is so important to him that he might hurt himself if she doesn't continue chatting with him. That are the kind of stories that people think about when people are overly enthusiatic. \n\nNow, I'm not saying that you're like that, but maybe you can see that people want to avoid encountering uncomfortable situations like that.",
