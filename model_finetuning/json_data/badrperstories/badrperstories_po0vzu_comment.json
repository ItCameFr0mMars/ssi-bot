I would for sure be super irritated *if*, for example, I agreed to do a scene with another person and they wrote the opening while controlling my character. Sure, if we agreed it's going to take place in a bar, it's not a huge stretch to assume my character is in that bar. I'm chill about that kind of thing. But if they write something like,\n\n&gt;Suddenly, a belligerently drunk man crashed into Sally and she spilled her drink down the front of her shirt.\n\n...and belligerently drunk man is supposed to be my character? Yes, I will absolutely ask that person to kindly take their paws off my OC and let me puppet him.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a huge ordeal, and while I'd be annoyed, I'd be willing to give the other person the benefit of the doubt and let them adjust. If they were unwilling to void the meat of their post (which in this example might consist of Sally's reaction to spilling her drink), I'd consider us fundamentally incompatible as RPers.\n\nIf I misunderstood everything completely I apologize. It's very early and I am mid-coffee. Did Person B want you to void the IC events in the scene with Person A because they didn't like something you did in your scene with them (Person B)? If that's the case, that's stupid. Only the parts that were an issue needed to be voided, and I'd agree it was a weird scheme to erase your character from the equation if they were jealous of your attempts to interact.",

            "body": "I mean this gently, because you do seem to be genuinely looking for advice on writing within group RPs and I don't want to come off as accusatory, but --\n\nYeah, you were in the wrong, but only in going to the admins about it.\n\nThe thing is, even in TTRPGs, if someone is so incredibly uncomfortable about a scenario, I think it's fair to come to the DM and ask for a retcon. In group RPs it's even more prevalent, because there are no really hard-and-fast rules about how things play out. You don't have a DM in every thread guiding people along. You don't (typically; every now and then I'll see a group that uses them) have dice rolls determining every outcome. It's a lot of creative freestyling, and sometimes, that takes a turn in a direction someone does not enjoy.\n\nIt also is, IMO, fair to make decisions like this based on OOC compatibility. This hobby is very big on \"safe spaces\", and a lot of that comes down to protecting ourselves from questionable individuals within the hobby. Now, please understand -- I am not calling you questionable, OP. But a lot of this hobby is full of so much drama that some of us become extremely reactionary to any possible perceived red flag and withdraw ourselves from the situation before it can become problematic, just because of our past experiences.\n\nI also want you to understand that I do see your side of things. I had a member of a group RP retcon an entire plot she'd worked on with myself and my ship partner because she \"felt uncomfortable about the vibe\" between the three of us. (In actuality, it turned out, she was just lmao a whole burning oil field of drama herself, and I think projected that onto us when we tried to set reasonable boundaries. But that's neither here nor there!) I was very frustrated by having to go back and adjust all of the threads and plot arcs we had developed around this thing she now wanted to yank out from under us. We had whole character development arcs framed around the conversations on this event which had to be altered, and I don't like going back and changing things once they're \"set in stone\" in my head for a character either. I get it! It's frustrating.\n\nHowever, I would never bring up an issue like this to the staff, or complain about it to the instigating individual, because it's important to understand that this is something people come to do for fun, and no one wants to be strong-armed into a plot they're not feeling, no matter the plot or the reason for the strong-arming.\n\nNext time, just let someone move forward. Thank them for their time and make your adjustments, and don't write new plots with them in the future.\n\nQuick edit for clarity.",

The conclusion I wanted to happen would have required nothing from the other player nor would it have forced them them to do anything.  \n\n\nAs a new player to the group asking the GM's where voiding is allowed if it's not mutually agreed upon is a valid way of behavior.  \n\n\nThe reason I brought it to the player was because I wanted to see if mature or adult conclusion could be reached that left us both being satisfied. And they got defensive/insulting. And to be fair, boundaries being breached couldn't be an excuse because the scene in question had nothing questionable about it.  \n\n\nThe biggest issue with this was the use of voiding when it's not agreed upon and when that happens you usually take it to a GM.   \n\n\nThe reason she gave was not OOC compatibility or comfort levels.

I am only trying to communicate to you how unusual your stance on this is in many group RP spheres. Note, I'm not saying \"all\" -- only \"many\". \n\nIn all of the group RPs I personally have participated in, the only kind of metagaming we are concerned about is, for instance, some in-character representation of it. If my post says:\n\n&gt;He looked the young man up and down, thinking, God, what a novice. Aloud however, he only shrugged, and smiled benignly. \"I'm sure you've got the hang of it by now,\" he lied with ease.\n\nAnd then your post says \"lol wow my character knows that's a lie what a fuckin lie you fuckin liar\" -- then someone might take issue with you. \n\nSomething like reading another writer's posts, deciding you do not want to be involved in that plot with that writer anymore, and retconning a predetermined plot? That is not metagaming. That is making an OOC decision based on OOC information. Your misunderstanding of this pretty clear delineation is what led me to (obviously incorrectly! which we've plenty established by now) assume that you were inexperienced with these group dynamics.\n\nFinally, I'm going to say one more time -- yes, as admins of RP communities, sometimes we do have to step in and mediate. However, it's really not our job, we don't enjoy it, and we don't want to do it any more than we literally have to. It seems to me that if your story was as simple as you present it -- \"I politely asked if this was metagaming, and the staff said no, and I accepted that\" -- then no one would have kicked you from the group. You are not even open to hearing anything I've said -- which was only, let's recall, \"probably should've just left the staff out of that one\" -- without taking offense to it, which is very telling about your personality tbqh. \n\nAt the end of the day, group RP staffers are just writers who took it upon themselves to create a setting and provide a platform for other writers to join them in telling a story. We are not your bosses, your managers, or your customer service representatives. If you create enough drama, we are going to remove you from our game, because we don't want the drama. \n\nIf that statement offends you, I encourage you to do some self-reflection and consider the real reasons why.",
