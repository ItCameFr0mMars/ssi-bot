Be forward is a better route than just bouncing. You will just have to hope the person on the other end is understanding of the situation.",

I ended up declining them because I didn't want to jump into something I wasn't fully confident in doing it. So, I decided I'll either reread 300 chapters of the manga or I'll continue to not roleplay it.\n\nI think a lot of us want to jump headfirst into a roleplay immediately. It takes a lot willpower and a little bit of self-reflection to decide whether or not you should actually go through with it. You're a good roleplayer for realizing you should maybe do a little more research before starting a roleplay about it. If you're going to confront them about it than you're far from a bad roleplayer.",
