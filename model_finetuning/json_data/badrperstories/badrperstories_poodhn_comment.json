            "body": "I've become more lenient on *a lot* of things over the years. My own writing is more stylized, freer with quirky grammatical \"choices.\" It's more casual. Less combed through and edited. I'm chill with partners doing things I would have once asked them to leave out of the RP. I've tried one-lining after years (and years, and years...) of writing posts of a certain approximate length. Found out it's not really my thing, but it was a ton of fun to loosen up and try, and I'd do it again!\n\nThat said, I'm stricter in other areas. I am putting up with absolutely 0 bullshit from partners who step on the boundaries I've established. If they hit on me IRL or get disrespectful, they're so very dropped. If a partner continuously \"forgets\" to reply, I assume they're just not that into the RP and let 'em off the hook (nicely). Ain't nobody got time for OOC drama and stress caused by a hobby.\n\nTL;DR: In a lot of areas I'm more focused on having fun than abiding by weird, arbitrary rules I picked up along the way. In others, I'm less willing to put up with BS than I was before.",

            "body": "I've kind of flipped flopped, but I feel like in some places I've gotten stricter.   \nI used to be laxer about OOC boundaries, and would ignore certain red flags. And sometimes I'd allow for 1st person POV writing... Now, certain redflags are a block. 1st person POV is a hard no from *either* person. I've never been a super strong stickler for requiring decent grammar, but these days certain grammar mistakes are much more of a pet peeve.\n\nI think the only place I've laxed up is post size. For a time I was pretty strict at meeting post size requirements. Big chunky things, 1000 word minimum, all that jazz. These days, it's entirely case by case on what kind of post sizes I like. It depends on three main factors: my partner, the roleplay/story, and the pacing. I started changing my size requirement a few years ago after having a WONDERFUL partner who write shorter posts (like 200-400 words per character). Her grammar and writing was perfectly fine, it was just much more rapid paced story telling that was very conversation based. It kind of pulled me out of that strict 1000 word mentality. \n\nNow, it depends entirely on who I'm writing with. The size doesn't matter much, if their style and the pacing of the roleplay fits shorter form. I still very much enjoy long form, but that's usually for longer paced, once a week or less posts. If I'm getting a small post, it needs to be for scenes that move rapid quick, rather than ones that feel more natural drawn out.",

            "body": "For me, all of my pet peeves (I prefer non-romance, grammar and spelling shouldn't be too bad, I mostly dislikes one-liners) came from problems I encountered while roleplaying. For example, I was very lenient when it came to grammar and spelling...until I had some roleplays were this problem became so bad that I couldn't make sense of what my partner had written, and asking 'What does this mean?' became  super embarrassing. I used to tell people that I'm okay with romance, as long as it wasn't the focus of the story and I'm allowed to write at least one character for whom romance isn't important...until I encountered a lot of people who told me they were fine with that, but then only wrote very short replies and rushed the parts of the story that weren't romance. I dislike oneliners because most people I know just write 'She smiled at him.', and if you reply most of the time only write twice a week like I do, the story can't really progress like that. \n\nNow, I have a roleplay with some shipping going on and it's super fun. But I also know that it's (at least for me) an exception, and that it's rare that a person is both interested in the more romantic aspects, and the progression of the non-romantic storylines, and likes the way I write romance. I still wouldn't search for romance, because my previous experiences have shown me that I'm not a great match when it comes to that topic with most people. For most of my pet peeves, except oneliners because I don't see myself writing rapidfire responses any time soon and ERP, there is always this little 'but under specific circumstances, it would be okay for me to write something like that/ I wouldn't mind if a specific requirement isn't perfectly met.'",

Long delay in posting times for a single line of text, a paragraph, or even multi-paragraph that literally looks like they took 15 minutes to type, didn't proofread, didn't edit, and only slapped some shit down. If that happens in rapid-fire, that's fine. But waiting for a week for something that's not edited or proofread and zero effort into it is a no.

I was doing a Victorian era RP, and my character gave a bottle of laudanum to my partner's character.  He proceeded to clean his wound with it instead of taking it orally as a painkiller.
