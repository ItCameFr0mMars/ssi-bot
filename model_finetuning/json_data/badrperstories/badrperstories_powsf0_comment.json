Funnily, this had me curious to read the further posts again, and in her next post, she DIRECTLY retcons her mad multitasking skills. Here is just the first paragraph of her follow up post,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Nova looked at the female and tilted her head almost in confusion as if she was a dog or something but she wasn't. She watched the girl run away **as she blinked** at the girls explanation or lack there of **as she** **blinked** at the girl **as she** ran away barefoot no less. \"What an odd girl\" She said more to herself **as she** shrugged **as she** paddled on **as she** pulled up to the bike rack and then got off the bike and locked it up **as she** headed into the school.\n\nI didn't even realize until now that she disregarded her putting up the bike in the bike rack, so that she could put it up a second time lol\n\n... I had to bold the \"as shes\" again for comedic effect.",

It was cool because we're good friends and we tend to make memes out of typos or funny mistakes. \n\nI also once read how a person took/ripped off another character's pants thrice somehow during a sex scene. I'm pretty sure that character was only wearing one pair of trousers!",
