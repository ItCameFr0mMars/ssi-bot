Those thick meaty paragraphs that are ALL the same size. Maybe that's just because my paragraphs are chaotic in size lol. I'll have a paragraph that's 2 or 3 sentences, and then will break off into a new paragraph that's like pretty chunky. Usually though, I work in many smaller paragraphs, rather than a bunch of meaty ones. I don't like stuffing paragraphs, I prefer to keep each paragraph to a line of thought or action, then move onto the next. But, I also indent to a new paragraph with any new dialogue, which I know not everyone does.\n\nThe only one that I'm a little opposite on and not full agreement with is 6. BUT, that's only because I can go either way with plotting. I've got three ways of plotting;  \n1) Making an outline that manages story beats well in advance. This only works with partners I have a good groove with. I've got roleplays with years of content planned, and we're still hitting planned story beats we've planned a year ago. It helps keep the interest going whenever actually writing is slowed. It's less twists and turns, but it's more so based on character reaction in these cases.\n\n2) Vague planning. Will vaguely plan ahead so that we can kind of keep things moving on a track, BUT, if things deviate, things won't be TOO derailed. It also helps so we're not stuck with a \"well... what now?\" situation\n\n3) No plotting. Jump in there lol. This one can be exciting bc we don't know what's ahead but....... these roleplays I've noticed, have the potential to die the earliest. Depends on the partner.",

Sure, some stories can get derailed but if you do it one scene at a time that means you can have the excitement of brainstorming again.  \n\n\nThere's an element of heavy planning that still allows for planning and organic interactions but it's a hard middle ground to reach.",

Not really talking about unpredictability in relationship progression (Difference in a slow burn and no burn) but more in like plot elements thrown in, surprising twists from the character, interesting usage of NPCs, or creative contribution to the story.\n\nThe draw of roleplay to me is a collaborative storytelling and not wish fulfillment or self-insertion. Shit doesn't pan out organically sometimes, that's fine with me.\n\nI think I understand where you're coming from though but I mean surprises and organicism in a fun way. There's still usually an end goal in mind or a pre-determined plot course (what happens at the plot points aren't determined though.)  And I mentioned heavily plotted. That means where basically the other player knows what they want my character to do/tells me what to do with them and I'm supposed to write my character only in a perfect way that appeals to whatever specific fantasy they have.",

Okay, this is something I struggle with myself to a degree... though not as much as it was once the case where I really would force myself to write more, now I won't force it if I really don't have nothing more to write. I still will feel low-key guilty if my post is much shorter than the one my partner sent beforehand, however. &gt;.&lt;\n2. Hum. I personally like to describe my character in detail, but honestly I will truly describe them in detail only in their introductory post, later on I will only allude to some of their characteristics, especially if they do stuff like fiddling with their hair... but yup, it was something I once done waaay to excessively, to the point where other people saw my character as obsessed with his hair (or mane, given it was a MLP RP. Don't judge!) even though I really, REALLY did not intend them to come across this way.\n3. Okay, I agree: changing a character's personality for a silly reason sucks. It's not something I do i'd like to say, though I probably did do it at least a few times, especially when I was younger.\n4. Okay, i feel called out. I mean, fair, my newer OCs are much easier to get to know/like than my older OCs, but I still have a bit of a soft spot for rough, edgy personalities lol - though then again, you are entirely correct, it's hard to expect the other character to go to the greatest lengths to defrost the Ice Queen, especially if they have no reason to.\n5. Well, yeah, some people want to have an evil/mean character with all the pros and none of the cons, which is to say that they tend to be quite hated in-universe. I mean, it depends, maybe I would get upset if a Jerk with a Heart of Gold was treated like an ordinary jerk, but in the end, yes, I agree. Characters with unlikeable personalities won't often be liked.\n6. ... hum. This is something I don't know how to quite address. I want my roleplays to have actual plots, so it does require a great deal of planning, though I wouldn't say I get particularly upset if things don't go my way. And frankly, most of the times I was indeed upset as to how things went in a roleplay were my fault entirely, as in I thought of something too late or was too much of a chicken to ask the other person\n7. ... do people do that?",
