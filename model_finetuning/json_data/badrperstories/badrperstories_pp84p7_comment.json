This gives them time to grab any posts they might want to keep.\n\nIf they \"forgot\" in all that time... still nah, buddy. If you cared about the RP, you would have checked at some point to see if it was your turn.\n\nBasically: you deserve to write with someone who is as excited about the RP as you are. You should not have to \"check in\" or prompt them to reply like this is a job, or like some RP debt collector. When they're having a good time and feel engaged, they'll post without requiring your herding skills.\n\nNow, if it's someone you've been writing with a long time, I'd let them know it's fine if they need a break, but that you're also open to hearing them out if there's anything about the story they'd like to change, or if they've lost motivation and would like to write something different with you.",

It largely depends how often you send a response.  \n\n\nIf I am used to two responses per day for example and I haven't gotten notified of anything that'd disturb that, I'd probably send a reminder already the same day, like if I usually would get the first response somewhere in the afternoon I'd wait until earlish evening, but if it's once per day I'd probably ask the day after that.

I'll ask straight out in a week and they don't answer or give something non-commital (unless we agreed to a slow pace)  I consider it dead in the water and create bandwidth for other stories. Generally, if someone gives me a passive response about continuing, I start looking for new stuff to fill that gap. I'd say maybe the two-week mark is where I'll end it (If I'm not already invested or it's one of those special people.)\n\nThere are good writers who I know will probably reply eventually and I never bother them.\n\nI don't like to send messages more than three times that are not responded to in any scenario and that's about the limit for inquiring about RP. If there's a consistent trend where it feels like I am more interested or I have to send multiple messages to get a response over and over again, I end it.  \n\n\nDepending on the story and person, sometimes all they get is one reminder or one question or an unanswered message.",
