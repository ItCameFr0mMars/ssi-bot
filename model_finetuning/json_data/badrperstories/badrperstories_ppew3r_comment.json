And then, when you post your search, you can add what gender the characters you write are. So I clicked female for my profile without thinking...and I get a lot of messages when I post my first search. First, I'm really happy. I look through them, and 90% are men who completely ignore what I'm searching for, try to get me to write the female role (although I clearly specified that I want to write the male role) in a romance or sometimes harem roleplay (I don't write romance). And when I ask them if they even read my search, they just shrug and tell me 'But your profile said female'. Some men who applied even got angry as if I lead them on, although I never mentioned anywhere that I write female characters, and in fact made it clear multiple times that I only write male characters.",

You're not trans and feeling out gender presentations as far as I know, you're just approaching this as 'I'm going to pretend I'm a gender I'm not to try and get more Rp'.  People will go \"oh no it's fine\" before it kicks in that honestly, it feels fucking weird when people lie to you about their identity for non-closet reasons.  Yeah you 'didnt say directly' but you implied you were to net that end result, same thing.\n\nAs a gril personally I'd shuffle the hell away because it'd reek of a guy that thinks 'girls get rp way easier' without stopping to consider *why* that is.  The amount of guys that will creep down the line or crush on you *solely* on the basis of \"so and so is A Gril i can have a conversation with\" is fucking exhausting to be honest.  A lot of guys girlfriendzoning you won't fucking behave, its annoying, maybe some of those contacts you netted were girls seeking to avoid that weirdness except then suddenly \"oh, nah this is a guy that fibs about their identity for Some Reason, maybe to drop my guard, maybe because he thinks girls get Rp easier\" and the latter just feels insulting at that point.

Maybe a few months into my roleplay experience. I'm a nonbinary person and on the internet, where I roleplay at least, it seems like no one cares really. Since I don't have preferred pronouns people tend just refer to me with male pronouns or just call me by my name. \n\nI usually run into women and I've never have a problem and when I find men we never have a problem no matter what my agab is (no one has ever asked actually). Now, where I roleplay it's right on my profile that I'm nonbinary and I've been getting lots of other trans / nonbinary people messaging me who fit my criteria now.\n\nI do think it's more so the fact that you were trying to go for a more feminine profile here instead of just being like \" I am a man who roleplays a woman \". In which people may believe they've been duped. Obviously, there's going to be the \"purists\" who want to do M4F or F4M who don't feel comfortable roleplaying with someone who is actually M playing as F4M. They may just not like roleplaying with another man and don't want to be rude and instead just ghost yk? \n\nI think this may just be a misunderstanding and that perhaps you should be completely transparent from the get. Anyway, wishing you luck with your endeavors.",
