If your reputation has been irrevocably tainted, it's probably best to move on. If it's a minor faux pas, it happens and just treat the situation with some levity and humility and it ought to blow over.",

Sounds to me like you guys were just more so meme-ing with your characters than actually RPing, which when I used to run group RP servers we'd do all the time in OOC channels. Stuff like that is a blast! If people get upset over something like that and treat you like a joke, then you've every right to be upset yourself. perhaps you should just try and see if the people you do get along with/RP with would like to stay in touch with you before leaving the server. I am not saying you should, but I definitely don't think you should have to put up with feeling shamed and made fun of, over this.",
