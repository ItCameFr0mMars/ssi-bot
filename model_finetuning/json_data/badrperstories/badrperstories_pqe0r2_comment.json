            "body": "Characters that are painfully uninteresting. And I don't mean they have to have a tragic backstory or something super detailed going on for them. Just ones that are poorly written and feel like blank slates. Or deliver stilted, unbelievable dialogue. Or feel more like poorly written anime protagonists rather than flawed interesting human beings.\n\nGranted, I never want to jump the gun too early on judging a character. Character development is absolutely a thing and is super important; I'll glad watch the progression of maybe an uninteresting or unlikeable character develop into something else... But a lot of the time, you can kinda *tell* that isn't going to be the case.\n\nIf the writing is good, and the story has potential, then I'll be more inclined to see where it goes, but a lot of the time poor writing, poorly written characters, and stilted dialogue go hand and hand and lead to duds.\n\nEdit to add: I guess that's not a matter of *how many chances*... And rather, a matter of how long it takes before I decide the characters aren't worth it. Besides overall poor writing, it's characters that'll lead me to lose interest the quickest. But I'll try and give it a handful of posts before coming to hard conclusions... Unless it all just adds up as bad.",

            "body": "That seems to be alot of the problem with alot of players out there. I RP on Discord and alot of characters out there seem to be cookie cutter templates with little effort. It's rare to find one that breaks the mold.\n\nWhile some people can RP a character's emotions, motivations, reasons for doing something, it has to be dynamic. If a character doesn't change, learn something, and grow at the end of a scene, then it isn't worth a commitment to me.\n\nThen again, I work alot IRL, so my RP time is extremely limited and my patience is thin this year. There absolutely has to be potential for change or growth in a few posts, much like leveling up in a video game. People change with time. So should characters.\n\nOne important thing is mutual plot progression in a post. If the other character only reacts and doesn't do anything other than dialogue for about three posts during a starter scene, then it usually is a deal breaker for me.\n\nPlease forgive me if I sound like an unpleasant person. Everyone has their own, unique peeves where they end RPs as a loss or not worth the time/effort. This is one of mine.",

There are so many interesting ways to write characters that aren't assholes. But some people just write 'uwu I'm so soft and nice, one bad word and I will cry for hours. No, you have to make every decision, it's far too scary for me!', and especially if the other person only writes one character (I always write more than character, but I'm totally open for writing with people who don't), it's often like this:\n\nmy reply: a lot of plot, asking the other person's character what they want to do in that situation\n\ntheir reply: their character saying something like 'I can't say, you decide'\n\nmy reply: something related to the plot, writing how the characters plan to go somewhere, my character says something questionable (if I write someone who isn't a good person)\n\ntheir reply: Lin (their character) thought that George's (my character's) reply was a little mean. She got really sad. She didn't dare to question his plans and kept her thoughts to herself. She walked with him to the castle.\n\nAnd so on. So I'm basically driving the entire plot forward, nothing really happens and if they contribute anything except their character's thoughts which my characters can't know, it's often something like:\n\nLin dances alone in the garden and my character should see her dance and ask her about. Lin takes care of a cute animal alone in her room. Lin is sad because she thinks about (sad thing), my character has to ask her whats wrong. Lin runs away because she is sad and the other characters have to search for her.",

I have definitely had some exchanges with people where it was very difficult for me not to ask this aloud.\n\nI think my particular grievance, semi-related to this, is when people simply don't seem to react to anything in my post. I am never sure if they're not reading it, or if they're simply disregarding everything in order to carry on their own conversation irrelevant to what my character is saying.\n\nExample, very obviously paraphrased:\n\n&gt;MyChar: Oh this is great, I really like this idea you just brought up. How long have you been working on it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TheirChar: I grew up near here you know. My father was really awful.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MyChar: Oh. That's. Out of left field okay but, yeah. Wow I'm so sorry. I had a strained relationship with my father too. We can talk about that idea you mentioned later. Are you still in contact with your family?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TheirChar: Also my aunt I went to stay with was abusive. And my mother always spoke down to me. And I couldn't wait to get away for college.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MyChar: Oh... okay. Wow, that's ... so much. Are you doing okay now?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TheirChar: Nursing was my real passion, and I pursued it with a vengeance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MyChar: ... Am I talking to myself right now? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Have I gone spontaneously mute?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TheirChar: Boy don't even get me started on my relationship with my brother. But since you asked, I'll tell you anyway ...\n\nThose are the only threads I tend to walk away from after four or five chances to pick up what I'm putting down, or I just leave them to die a slow death on their own out of sheer frustration. I want to write **with** you, not just exist to witness your monologue, thanks!",

When I'm the only one moving the storyline forward because apparently being 'a good guy'=being passive.\n2. Someone who will never let their character be wrong or look foolish. This character always is *immediately* suspicious of someone lying to/trying to deceive them, even if they have no reason to be at the time. If they ever do something morally questionable, it turns out down the line they were \"right all along.\" Just constantly absolved of any consequences for their actions. Good God it's exhausting.\n3. If I'm playing a character who could hurt their character and they pull that \"I'm going to have my character blatantly disrespect your character or do something else that would typically endanger my character's safety, and *you're* going to have to figure out why your character doesn't hurt mine because you can't hurt them without godmoding uwu\" crap. Fuck off.\n4. If they want my character to \"chase\" or \"pursue\" their character, but they aren't worth pursuing or chasing. Like, I get it. There's an appeal to that sort of plot line and I'm not fundamentally against it, but they gotta give me a better reason than \"they're hot\" to go for it. RPs are filled with hot people. It's not even special at this point. (Like, I actually get a little sort of thrill that bubbles up inside of me when someone chooses a *kinda normal-looking person* as an FC.)",

            "body": "When I used to accept those Canon x OC RPs playing the canon and it was clearly all about just fulfilling the partner's fantasy to get courted and laid by the character I played. \n\nSorry but while I'm fine with writing sex scenes when they do eventually occur, I never signed up for blatant ERP. And, if you want this character to fall for yours, then it's gonna take time. I'm not here to cater to you and I'm not going to write a character bending them completely outside of what they're like just for your 'beautiful' character. That shit has to develop naturally. And there's a chance it may not at all. Your character basically spreading her legs for mine on the first encounter is off-putting. \n\nAnd no, narrating time and again to point out every few sentences how beautiful, pretty, and cute she is; with her sparkling eyes, thin waist, perky booty, and what not, isn't gonna work either to entice me. In fact, I dislike such narratives. If you as the writer wanna simp over your own character go for it but leave it out of the story. It's gross and super cringe. Keep your opinions out of the narrative. Let's leave it up to my character to decide if he thinks she's cute or pretty and what not based on objective descriptions. \n\nAlso. Even if she looked pretty idgaf if it's an empty shell beyond that with zero personality. That said; this is why I don't do canon x OC anymore. The OCs are always generic hot chicks and it never has a story even if while pre-planning I was made to believe there would be. Well there is story, because I try to write it. But without a good partner to contribute and bounce off of that becomes a drag real fast. That one in and of itself is a big no too.\n\nAnother one I'm done with real soon are people who provide no context, especially when time skipping a lot. So...  um, ok, you made us move on to the next day but where are we? What's happening? Funny enough this happened a lot in canon x OC RP too.\n\n Canon x OC seems to be a cesspool of big fat no-no's for me, haha. That's why the canon x OC pairing has become a hard no from me to begin with. Never had a good experience with it.",
