If I can\u2019t read it and I\u2019ve pointed it out to you and you\u2019ve failed to remedy it/provide a reason as to why it\u2019s not readable then I will end the rp. \n\nI\u2019ve had a fair few partners with dyslexia/other writing and reading disabilities  who would always ask me to proof read for them/took longer typing out a response before sending it and you could tell they were trying pretty hard to make sure it was alright. They eventually moved on due to unrelated reasons but in all honesty, I sometimes forgot they even had a disability that affected their writing because they were able to keep the story going and give me responses I could read well enough to understand. To me, they were just another writer who had extra steps they needed to take.\n\nEveryone\u2019s situation is different of course, maybe the dude you were with hadn\u2019t had someone tell him that he didn\u2019t produce readable responses or hadn\u2019t revealed to anyone else that he had a problem due to fear of being kicked out of the server.\n\nAll in all, It\u2019s not ableism in the slightest to turn someone down because their quality of writing wasn\u2019t to your standards. If you\u2019d just said \u201chmmm Nah, I prefer someone able.\u201d Or something else intended to be a stab at their disability, That would\u2019ve been ableism. Telling them that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good match is being honest and not ableist at all. \n\nIn short, you\u2019re fine dude. You did nothing wrong. He was probably just a bit upset.",

It's very sad and I hope I didn't come across as bullying to this person, but some of what they said came off as a little guilt trippy? Such as:\n\n\"If you can't rp giving people chances even if they can't be advanced like you then you're kings and queens of douche..\"\n\n\"I know I don't write like others but I rather to be respectful and give me chances instead of not rping with me at all.\" \n\n\"I have solutions who wanna be two-faced not rp with us because we rebel to write a damn novel advance. Bitch block begone! \"\n\nThese are some of things they said on a different account of the same name. They also said something about not wanting to write a \"damn sample\" so I'm assuming they must've gotten pretty desperate to message me and write one anyway. I do feel bad for them and I think they might just be genuinely unaware and misdirecting some of their anger onto the novella writers, but I honestly don't think the server is good for their mental health from how it sounds.",

Now the admin that welcomed me had me read the rules, limits, and whatnot. In her bio, she mentioned being dyslexic, to which I thought 'Oh, no biggie, I will be extra-careful when I read their posts.' I had RPed with people that suffered from ADHD/Dyslexia a few times before, some are even around today. \n\nYet, every single message they posted was *taiped lik dis* and worse yet, they were put in charge of every single Google Doc section. Yes, OCs, settings, plotlines? All in the hand of a single person. I had to explain myself 3 times to get them to understand me. Eventually, I left. \n\nSo I think that it doesn't come down to ableism if you go about it the way you did, RPing is a hobby I have limited time to dedicate to as well, and if I can't understand a partner, and that is mutual? Then I will pack my stuff, thank them for their time, and be on my way.",
