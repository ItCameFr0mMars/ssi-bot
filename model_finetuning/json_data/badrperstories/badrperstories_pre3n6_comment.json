            "body": "I don't think I could do it with responses that short. And I'm very patient. I've got a roleplay going that started last year, and only like... 4 days passed? Granted, 2 of those days were flashbacks before a 15 year time skip. But besides the point. It's very very slow paced, and replies come anywhere from once a week to once a month, BUT, the word count is like 700-1500 a post. Averaging at about 1000 words. It's slow, but every new reply whenever they do come along are very entertaining to read.\n\nBut for topping at like 200 words, for a slow paced roleplay? Nah, I wouldn't be able to do it. I wouldn't want to wait days or weeks for a reply that might take me 10-15 minutes to write. I just feel like I'd lose interest. The appeal to me of a short, 200 word post, is for a rapid paced roleplay.\n\nJust me speaking from personal experience. I'd probably just taper out unless the story was just super engaging. But, Idk. 200 words every so often just doesn't seem worth the wait to me.",

            "body": "I think the way we treat others can often lead to certain expectations. For example, when you never/rarely communicate that you value being able to reply often/that you want the other person to inform you when they can't reply for a while, the person might think that you're actually comfortable with a slow post frequency and no communication when it comes to that. I have a roleplay like that, basically we reply when we can, sometimes there are weeks were nothing happens and then quick replies on some days, with no information when the other person will be 'back'. \n\nYour partners might think 'If they never complain, then there is no issue.' Do you tell them when they have been away for a longer period of time 'Don't worry, it's fine.'? Do you mention that they were away at all, or just let it slide and chat like you normally do? Being too nice and forgiving can in turn lead to people becoming too comfortable. \n\nIf you like the roleplays, I would give it a try and communicate that you would love to reply more often. You can phrase this in a positive and not accusatory way, and if you like these people and they like you, I think it won't be a problem and is worth a try. But if you don't think it's worth the effort or have already lost interest, it's also fine to let go. Just make sure that you won't regret the decision not to communicate later on.",

Reply whenever you want.' they might get the impression that it wasn't a big deal for you, and you were really just worried that have lost their interest, and as long as they reply at all (no matter when) it's fine. \nI'm not saying that you should be super rude to them or pressure them into replying when something bad has happened in their real life. But in the future, maybe you should voice your expectations a little more clearly and sooner. Better to realize 'Ah, we really don't share the same post frequency, there is nothing to be done here, I should move on' than to be dragged along endlessly and end up resenting the roleplays. \nGood luck with your future searches, I think it's really for the best that you ended these roleplays now!",
