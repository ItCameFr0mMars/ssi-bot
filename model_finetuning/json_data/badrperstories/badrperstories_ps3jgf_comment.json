If they prodded I might say it's for \"personal reasons\", but honestly they should respect this decision at face value. If they still insist on a reason, perhaps you could say something like you want to keep this world as a personal project? Or something that doesn't leave room for them to try and negotiate a continuation.\n\nNormally I think honesty is the ideal policy, but if this person is so sensitive to criticism yet unwilling to change I would spare myself the headache. \n\nAnyway, just a suggestion from a random - you know this person and what would work best, so it's up to your discretion of course!

However, running a cast of characters could still be an option for you.\n\nI don't know how much of my PoV applies to you, but I am in a similar boat, one RP with my NPC cast and another player's one character.\n\nIt is perfectly viable to write details for all your characters, the world, and the descriptions. I did this too at first, but as the plot continued, I found it easier to shorten the individual character posts to a series of a few sentences except the one NPC being directly interacted with. This helped keep length to equal the other player, so that running that many characters doesn't feel like a chore in comparison.\n\nBut as for the plot and script being broken (a kiss, I believe), you're perfectly in your rights to terminate an RP at any time. It seems like you were working on fulfilling someone else's fantasies and your creative efforts weren't being reciprocated properly.",
