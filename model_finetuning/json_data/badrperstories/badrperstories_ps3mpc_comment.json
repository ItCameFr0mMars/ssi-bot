            "body": "My main way, of trying to keep hyped for a story, is to plot and plan ahead. Even if a vague outline. \n\nOR, if something happens within the story that *totally* makes my interest fizzle, I may see with my partner to see if some backtracking is possible.\n\nFor example, I had (and still currently going) one story where things took a turn that wasn't expected and while it was interesting drama at first, it caused the characters to hit a road block that would NOT easily be overcome due to the circumstances. Due to one decision made, it caused a butterfly affect that almost would change the course of the story entirely. This might normally not be a bad thing, and could have led for an interesting plot twist/development... But actually as it was, it just made my interest in the story totally fizzle. So I took a step back and thought: well, if it continues down this path, I may lose interest in it due to pure frustration. But I didn't want to end it either, so I took a moment to speak with my partner, and told her what was up and how I was feeling. Basically I was like, either I need a break from the story to think (and hopefully not lose my muse entirely), or some adjustments might need to be made.\n\nMy partner was super understanding, and we decided to retcon that one decision that made the butterfly affect of things going off the tracks. Maybe that was cheating a little, but it totally threw the story in a direction I worried would make me lose my muse entirely.\n\nBasically in that instance, I was pretty straight forward that the way things were going had me losing interest, and my partner was super understanding in that situation.\n\nAlternatively, in different roleplays, I've managed to keep multiple stories going for years (about three years now at current), and it has been because me and this other partner plan ahead with an outline. Multiple RPs actually. We're writing out things now that have been planned like a year in advance, and we have enough planned to keep the story to continue for hopefully years further. Sometimes if I can't write for awhile, it's fun to just plot. It keeps the interest going. And if there's a long gap between replies because life has been busy, thinking about what has been planned is enough to get me in the mood to get right back into things. \n\nMaybe not the advice you're looking for, but this is just what has kept my longest running stories going for as long as they have.",

            "body": "Oof, that's a tough one, but I can empathize. When I first got back into roleplay about a year and a half ago (used to do it way back in my teens/twenties but I'm a bit older now, and COVID + a night job gave me more time to indulge myself), I just went hog-wild and got into ALLLLL sorts of roleplays. Typical kid in a candy store motif.\n\nBut gradually, over time, I must've just burnt myself out by spinning all those plates. I went from nearly a dozen at one point to just one steady one, which is all I seem to have the energy for right now.\n\nThe thing is, that early brainstorming stage is *fun*. It's all full of possibilities, you're just bouncing ideas around, the scenes &amp; characters could go anywhere, and I think that part alone can be addictive. Maybe why I went a little crazy at the outset.\n\nThe hard part is the actual *writing*, and sometimes it's a slog. It may be that you're less enthused when it comes to putting down the words versus the creative/brainstorming phase.\n\nOr, alternately, maybe your partner(s)' writing just isn't as inspiring as you'd hoped? I had learned over time to always ask for a writing sample first, so I could see if it passes the simple test of \"do I want to keep reading this?\" If the writing is lackluster or not terribly engaging, then maybe that's the problem.\n\nBut if it's just a matter of finding some scenes less exciting/engaging than others, well, that kinda comes with the territory. There may be times where you need to force yourself, like pushing through the last bit of a workout, or getting over that last hump of an uphill climb, just so you can get to the \"good stuff\" on the other side.\n\nIt could also be pandemic fatigue, which I think we tend to overlook. But I have definitely seen a drop in my creative output during this last year and a half, overall, and I think this extended period of social isolation is taking its toll. Don't discount that, either!",

            "body": "I'm not really sure if my perspective will be anything you can relate to, but I'll share in case it brings some insight. For context, I only have 3 roleplays going right now between two different people. One of them is years-long (3+), another is I think about 1.5 years old for now, and the other will be coming up on a year (though we're just coming out of a pretty long hiatus). The post frequency has varied between within a day to a couple months, and they're all 1k+ words for the most part. \n\nI've definitely faced many times where it's hard to write a post, especially if it's been a while since my last one. When that happens, I just force myself to sit down and work through it. I don't know if this is practical or works for everyone, but to me it's the only way to get it done. Is it my best writing ever? No, but if it meets my partners' expectations, somewhat meets my own satisfactory standards, and moves things along, then we're all okay with it.\n\nConsidering the lifespan of these roleplays, the gaps in-between posts, and recurrent writer's block, I'd say my interest for each is still healthy. I wouldn't say that I'm giddy and buzzing with excitement, or totally enraptured like I was when we first started plotting - but I'm still very much invested and interested in the plot and our characters. I want to see through the ideas we've come up with, what new ones we'll think of along the way, and how exactly it'll all play out in the end. My partners and I have what I think is a good balance between planning ahead (just enough to give direction to the plot and maintain interest) and keeping things open to spontaneity (i.e., not planning everything out to a T, and staying flexible).\n\nAside from all that, I also think back to the elements of the story that got me excited in the first place, and that helps to keep me going too. Perhaps that approach - or something like it - might help you. Or, if your muse is waning and there is another idea you want to pursue, maybe you can think about how to incorporate the most exciting elements of that new idea into your current plot? \n\nAnyway, that's just me. Based on your post, it does sound a little bit like you *may* have a bit of novelty-seeking, given that new stories and new partners seems to bring out your inspiration fairly reliably. I think a more rapid-fire, short-term setup might work well in that case, but it sounds like that's not exactly your style. But it's something to consider if you are flexible.\n\nIn the end, I think it's important to really reflect on how you feel when you start to lose muse, because the root cause of this issue (be it FOMO, poor self-discipline, novelty-seeking, or otherwise) isn't anything that anyone else can determine or fix for you.\n\nApologies for the big ramble. I dunno if it helped at all, but thanks for reading this far and best of luck!",

There is always some vague planning but maybe I require more.  \n\n\nRe-reading the story or re-reading posts that were more interesting/ evoked feelings might help! It's hard to know what ideas I would want to incorporate because they don't usually come out until live brainstorming sessions.   \n\n\nSo I wasn't asking for help fixing novelty seeking or FOMO because I could consider that as an aspect of my personality but self discipline is definitely something that could help me push through the less-exciting posts.  \n\n\nPersonally don't know if I've experienced burnout/writers block ever as much as feeling discouraged/demotivated which may happen way earlier than burnout would occur.",
