You want complex plots with mature themes without it becoming smut focused but often are faced with folks with different priorities. \n\nI feel like the hobby of RPing has gained a ton of traction in the last 10 years which is awesome but there is a definite divide between ages (teens, young adults) and interests. I feel your frustration, OP. Keep at it. I hope you find the partner who ticks the right boxes for you. :)",

He knew I was over 10 years older than me and I foolishly assumed he was in his in his 20s and he his that info until he ghosted me. It hurt but the lie by omission hurt more because he was the ideal partner and friend up until then.\n\nIt makes me really nervous to write with anyone that young because legality can come into question without one person being aware.\n\nI think it's possible to find mature (mentally and emotionally I mean) writers who are young but with lack of life experience and even offline priorities (school vs work schedules) can make things difficult to find stability. And trust. It's a shame many push for smut, I've lost partners because the plot would always shift that direction without it being necessary, and even getting in the way of character development.\n\nIt's best to be up front regarding smut situations. I tell potential partners that smut scenes take months to develop and I even offer a rough estimate of frequency and that typically rules out people looking for a more robust amount of smut. It's a tough search for sure and I feel like it's worth waiting for someone who shares the same priorities in writing.\n\nI've almost gotten to the point of removing it from my RPs but I know it has its place.\n\nHave you looked beyond discord, on reddit or forums?",

I look in the RP chats, look at the community, and in my eternal pickiness I stand it out. Age differences do not help at all because most of the stuff interesting to me is usually coming from those above the age of 22, but usually, their experience and view of the internet and how you communicate on it is so inherently different than mine that it further accentuates my indecision when picking a partner. \n\nFunny little anecdote too, about 6 months before I had turned 18 I joined an 18+ RP server without realizing it. When I did, I said I'd wait in the unapproved lobby for those 6 months. Time passes, I find no other good RPs that I can attach myself to, and the time comes where I can verify myself.

Sadly, we agreed to retire the RP when IRL priorities took over for them. And all the interesting, or at least, more balanced and unique things come with experience.\n\nThat 6 month wait sounds like it sucked. Some 18+ servers that I checked out require ID verification. Before anything, I always ask the staff team 'Does the 18+ section has non smut RPs?' Surprisingly, alot of them answer me honestly and save alot of time. It's still disappointing on some servers where the ERP/RP ratio is so high. But that is just how it is for some, I guess.",

It'll bother me to keep broken things.\n\nSadly, I don't have numbers like you do. They're less than 100 to be sure. Completed arcs are probably the same as your successful ones give or take a few.

And it all started from a fairly simple ad premise (a bit GoT-inspired, too!) and now we've got various countries, maps, a lexicon, and an ever-growing cast of characters.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that if that one partner bails, then there goes that whole world.
