Your \"dirty\" ERP prompts and posts are but just one of these.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I started RPs I did keep separate profiles (one with ERP prompts, one with non-ERP prompts, and one with no prompts), but after having a few brief but wonderful RP experiences with ERPs that just went off the rails with plot and character development, I don't bother with keeping the prompts separate anymore.  Especially after reeling in my empty hook time and time again with the non-ERP prompts.  And I may even retire my non-prompt account soon.",

            "body": "I am someone who is cool with ERP, but I want sex scenes to support the story, not to be the entire story. My biggest problem when searching for RP is that I was clearly advertising for story-driven roleplays, but I would still get contacted in droves by people who wanted their fetishes to be the main points in the story. It is seriously off-putting, and it made me wary of pursuing roleplays with people who had sexual content in their post history.\n\nIt's not that I don't think there are people out there like me, who are okay with sex and also okay with general. It's just that when you've dealt with stupid coomers again and again and again you start to automatically filter people out based on patterns noted from past experiences.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with making a second account to keep those two lives separate. It's only sneaky if you PM someone who made an ad for general RP and then start asking for your kinks to be added to the story. *That* would be falsely advertising yourself.",

So some people are wary if there is no indication in the other person profile that they do non-sexual roleplays at all, and then the person replies to their non-sexual search. \n\nEspecially if your search seems to line up with the kinks they explore in their ERP story prompts (for example, let's say I want to write a non-sexual story about someone who is forced to have a demonic contract with a devil, and all of there ERP prompts are about the same thing, but kinky). I personally wasted so much times with people who applied for my stories, seemed really nice and into it, and after a week planning they either 1. realize it's non-sexual because they haven't read my requirements or 2. even worse, try to guilt trip me into writing ERP by saying it's childish not to write it, I should try to compromise, and so on. I would never turn down someone who does ERPs, but I understand that some people get wary if their profile seems to be exclusively focused on that.",

If I looked at your post history, the way you interacted with people or advertised yourself might be red flags. If I specifically asked for a non-smut RP, but you only do ERP, I would be hesitant because that's obviously at odds with my ad. If you were rude to people you interacted with, or didn't seem to have the best sense of grammar/literacy, I might also be wary, but I would still have that first conversation.\n\nSomeone with a history of writing ERP isn't a red flag to me. The only red flags I would have would be if they were requesting something I made it clear I don't write, or if their previous interactions have been disrespectful/negative/difficult.",
