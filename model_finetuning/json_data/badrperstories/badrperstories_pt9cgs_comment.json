Just because she's a nice person OOC doesn't mean you have to continue something you're not looking forward to. From first hand experience, I know what this situation is like. If she's a very good person like you say, she should understand your reasons for not wanting to continue. It feels so fucking bad to be the one trying to dredge the RP out of the garbage it's slowly sinking into CONSTANTLY. It's a drain and you don't need it. RP is supposed to be collaborative and above all, fun.\n\n\"There's too much ERP and not enough story, or planning. I don't like that the future of our RP rests solely on my shoulders and I also don't think our writing styles mesh well.\"  \nI would just be honest, while still being nice to her. It seems like the only thing that's fine is your OOC interactions, but you met her because you wanted to RP. Maybe you can still be friends, but you're doing yourself and her a disservice by continuing the RP when you're not feeling it anymore. You might start to resent her or your writing quality will undoubtedly drop because you're just not into it. It's not worth it.",

You no longer enjoy the story. You don't enjoy her writing. You guys are incompatible in the planning/pantsing department. You're incompatible in your smut/story ratio preferences. It's not a match, and that's okay! Doesn't mean you're not both fantastic people.\n\nSince you like and respect her, you don't need to burn bridges. Let her know kindly that you've lost steam for the story. You can explain that you forged ahead a while to see if you could get it back, but at this point, you'd prefer to shelve it. Keep her on your friends list; you never know! But to string this along when you're this done is a disservice to both of you.\n\nPlus, think of it this way: the sooner you end this RP with her, the sooner you can both look for your writing matches! That goes for her as much as it does you. Surely she would enjoy writing with another person who hates planning and loves an extra serving of ERP?",
