Life happens to everyone, but a lack of communication about it and leaving you in the dark and collecting dust without any updates isn't a good sign imo. It shows either a lack of importance (rp wise) or a lack of respect for you as a person. Imo it might be a nice enough RP but if it's only 4 posts in and they're already too busy AND not communicating OOCly, I'd move on. But that's me and not communicating is a big thing to me.",

If it's already been a week of radio silence \\[where you're not going to get an idea of when they're going to post a response\\], I would just cut my losses anyways.
