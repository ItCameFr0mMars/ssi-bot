If I don't lead things along things won't move because others seem incapable of moving the story along.  I just got to the point where I let my partners know straight up. \"Hey in my AD I specifically stated I want someone who contributes to the story / world setting. If you can't do that I'm not gonna stay interested much longer\".   \n\n\nIf I want to DM an RP I'll DM a DND game. I don't want to know everything that's going to happen ever and be the sole person responsible for actually moving things along. Some will try to make plot points, others will get intimidated and just ghost after that. Either way whether it works out or not I'm at least not wasting my time with an RP that's just \"okay\".   \n\n\nI RP to have fun, being in a mediocre RP sounds like the same thing as going to a theme park and then just watching as your friends ride the rides instead of you. If you aren't getting everything you want out of an RP. Tell your partners and try to fix it. Or else be greedier and pickier with partners don't settle for anything less than what you want because all it will do is make you feel frustrated and like you need to vent. \u2665",

            "body": "It sounds like finding the ideal partner set the bar for you\u2014but now that they're gone you're back to weaving through a humongous school of fish. You'll get all kinds of writers, even in small forum RPs. Advanced literate writers sound like they'd be right up your alley, but I'm assuming that's exactly where you've been looking. Everywhere is just too crowded, vague, and everyone's writing style is different or limited by their experience, so it's difficult to find that ideal partner again. You could even find someone that wants most of the same things that you want, but it's one thing to want something and another thing to actually write it. Writing is just a difficult hobby, and Roleplaying is even more difficult.\n\nYou mentioned writing a book not being quite the same because it isn't the same. A book is your highest quality, professional work written over an extended period of time. Roleplaying is much more fast-paced and geared towards amateur writing because it's all just for fun, even if it can be tough. There's a difference between writing for a roleplay and writing professionally. You might enjoy someone who falls under both categories.",

The only advice I can give you, if you want some, is to either (1) keep trying because it's a lot like dating, sometimes you have to go through a lot of awful first dates to find the one who really clicks; or (2) take a break for a while, and come back to it when your frustration has waned and you're lol honestly feeling more desperate again for some RP interaction. Your bar lowers itself. \n\nI went through a drought for a long time and then lucked into the most amazing partner completely by chance. People like you describe are still out there!
