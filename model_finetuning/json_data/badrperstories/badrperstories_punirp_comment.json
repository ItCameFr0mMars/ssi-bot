They think it doesn't matter because they want to role play and you and your group should automatically just bend over backwards to make sure they can roleplay the exact way they want to. No I'm not exaggerating I had someone say that to me.\n\nWe had a guy a while back, who joined and he seemed pretty nice. We should have known he didn't look at anything when his character accidentally had the same last name as another character. But it was something common, think Smith and the other writer was ecstatic at the possibility they could somehow be related or something so everything was cool. The server has certain rules, such as no Canon characters, no overpowered characters etc. So he makes the bio. You have to select whether you're one of the good guys or one of the bad guys. Both of these groups have names but I'm not going to say them for anonymity sake. He says he's both. Which is red flag number two that he didn't read the explanations of what the two groups are. They are very much mutually exclusive. This is explained to him and he picks good guy. Then he wants to have eight superpowers. One of which includes shapeshifting into a momster. The rest were not small things either, they included things like control over animals and elements. \n\nHe's told that that's too strong. He picks one power that he says doesn't work for long, and then says his other flaw is that he gets angry. Sometimes losing control of his abilities because he's so angry. Once again he's told it's not happening. That's when he gets mad and angrily tells us we should be glad it doesn't have: insert crazy super weapon here *like in the show* Turns out it was an anime boss villain. He argued so hard about why he should be allowed to play it and told us how much it sucked for him because he wanted to role play. \n\nOne person even offered to help him make a brand new character. Everyone was being so nice and patient with him as he just dug his heels in. He did not get to join the group.",
