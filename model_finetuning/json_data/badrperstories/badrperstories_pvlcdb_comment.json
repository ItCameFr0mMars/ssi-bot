I can tell you, it's really bad in the MxM department too. Women are often writing with more vigor than us guys, which lets you know who's invested in the story and who... Well... Isn't there for the story. I'm not always rapid-response for a reason and that's because I try to think about what the content sounds like and I have to make sure that the character's 'voice' carries with the situation. If it doesn't? I trash it, start from scratch, and then hit the Discord limit. xD  \n\n\nWhen it's dryer than the Sahara, it's because they drank all the damn water cause they were so thirsty. .\\_.",

Honestly those are some of the most important parts of the RP, is how it starts and how they respond. It sets the whole dynamic from start to finish for scenes.  \n\n\nI also sympathize with that. My character's last BF was just... It was very, very *dry.* It's one of the reasons why I never really took them to the next level because like... There's gotta be some personality there. There's just gotta.   \n\n\nAnd good to hear! xD There was a lot of guys, especially the ones with gay characters in this last setting I was in that was just... The most they have going for them? Are the attractive face credits. There was a lot left to be desired even in super miniscule date settings. Of course, they'd come around and OOCly say they want to do it again, but that you should change your character because the energy wasn't there. I was like, \"Uuuuh, does your character have a story?\" \"Not really, no.\" The noise my brain made felt like it beached whales clear on the other side of the continental US.",

And when you can't have a nice chat out of the rp, how am I meant to believe you can convincingly flirt in the RP?\n\nOooooh my god, so much that. Soooooooo much that. So, my character was known for not falling into the grain of male beauty. He's a magic nerd, first and foremost as well as the nervous type where I'd do a secret roll on how hilarious his reaction could be in terms of being flirted with. However since he went against that grain, the majority of the community passed him by.  \n\n\nSo there was this one guy that would often sigh because there was no monogamous, *hot*, gay characters popping into the community. Now, my character wouldn't have dated his because 1) it's just like you said; pretty to look at, but really bland, but 2) he had no story other than some car race plot. I had to prove to *him* however that my character had the story, so I sent him samples of solos of the character that also had side-characters that fleshed out that story more. Y'know. Worldbuilding.  \n\n\nLong story short, he kept asking me about my alt who had a more attractive face credit, whom I was struggling to make sense of story wise (he was on his third rewrite). I wasn't feeling it, I wasn't about to drag someone along when I had the potential of just deleting the account. He had two Twitter interactions with him, instantly thought the character was husband material without so much as even a date. On top of it, he was already trying to tell me how to rewrite the character to his liking, rather than the character I set out to try and keep. \ud83d\udc80  \n\n\nThere definitely has to be realism, realistic expectations, and honestly the guy's concept of flirting was \"Wow, you're hot.\" The more 'attractive' character was like \"Tell me something I don't know or don't waste my time.\" \ud83e\udd23",

I'm not looking for a BFF (though, tbh some of my RP partners have *become* very good friends of mine...hell, my first RP partner *is* my best friend) but god damn I need to have a good rapport going with whomever I'm planning with. I make it very clear in my ad that I'm looking for someone who's comfortable with casual OOC chatter because when people aren't it just falls flat for me (and yet, people who are terrible at OOC chat still answer my ads).\n\n90% of the time when I drop a potential partner who has gotten past the initial screening stage but doesn't make it to the RP stage it's because I don't like chatting with them in the planning stage. \n\nI get some people can be shy and it takes a bit to open up. I'm not asking someone to bear their soul after exchanging five messages. I get that it takes time to build trust but there's a a whole lot of space in-between between oversharing in the first five minutes and being a black hole where humor goes to die. \n\n(There are also people whom, for whatever reason, I just find annoying OOC so I decide I'm gonna bounce because I don't want to deal with it for however long the RP ends up lasting, and I'm ~~probably~~ definitely *that person* for someone else, so, we all get to choose whom we spend our time with.)",
