I've mentioned my cyberstalker before in other threads, but it's pretty much the same. She would have her female character hit on my character who was an openly gay male. Her response to this was behind the scenes and behind my back; \"How could he know he's gay? He's never done it with either, so how?\"  \n\n\nWhat made matters worse is that she did a lot of other uncool things like circumventing blocks or trying to force her character onto another's knowing it wasn't okay OOCly. What she decided to do with me was make a male alt thinking this would magically fix all of that. It's led me to have more of a preference writing with other gay men for RP partners/smut with my characters since I only write gay men at the moment.  \n\n\nHonestly, people who think that they can change an orientation have no idea how sexuality works. It's flat out a microaggression. I've seen people who say it isn't and it really is. Even the APA has recognized it as such. I'm sorry you had to deal with it, but good on the others for not validating his BS views and good on the mods for doing something about it. Literally *none* of us should have to go through that.",

            "body": "I often wonder the same thing even when they're batting for the same team. There was one guy that was just... OBSESSED with my alt, who was a chore for me to write. I don't normally write the sly guy, they're often super-tropey nerds.   \n\n\nThis guy didn't care about my main's story because the face credit wasn't hot. Yet when we first started talking? \"I don't gauge RP on face credits.\" I'd tried many times to involve him in plots, even tried to help him write a better backstory for his character, but he just wouldn't do anything with my main.   \n\n\nWe had a final conversation where he was like \"I'd really like for my character to go out with your alt\" and I was like \"You haven't even touched the story material with my main, so I'm not going to throw those two together when I'm still trying to fix him.\" He was like, \"Oh, I can help with that!\" and I finally asked him why he wouldn't engage with my main. \"He doesn't seem to have a story and tbh, he's just not hot.\" I quoted what he said about the not gauging RP on face credits and said, \"The character isn't looking to date yours. It's strictly plot material. You've interacted with him a lot more than my alt, yet you're willing to do story/romance with them instead? I have to pass. Sorry.\"  \n\n\nSo you're definitely right. They're just there to bang and be done. The ironic part is; both people say they don't write smut or ERP, yet their actions kinda tell me that that's all they want in the wings while they look special. Meanwhile the characters I write, I try to not even have them the focus of their own stories because I like to give others that opportunity to shine without overshadowing everything else. It's... I really think it's because RP culture has shifted from something that used to be organized to something more MMO, immediate, and watered down. :(",

I get it, smutty times are great, but I make it a personal standard that any OC I use regularly has a core storyline to follow; some goal or cycle to follow when they aren't being yanked into Shenanigans, because if no one is going to interact, I'm not going to leave them dependant on others to operate. At that point, they can join the story or pleasantly derail it into something more engaging, but it usually NEVER involves romance or anything like that because that a cheap motivation at this point unless you can spin a REALLY good reason. I only have one OC who revolves around sex and that's because she's an escort and professional sugar baby who makes a living off her social connections and such; she's also aromantic though so her relationships are purely platonic+sex or for money/companionship and won't attach herself to anyone romantically.\n\nAnd it's hilarious that she's open to being boinked at any time but NO ONE offered, they all focused on the less-sexual and more plot oriented characters. That server even had a whole ass brothel so if they wanted to get it done, they could, but no one DID. It was astounding. They really wanted the smut but also apparently bragging rights about who it was with? It's weird.\n\nBut that doesn't top the guy who did NOT read the preferences of a female OC and got turned down because of it, while they went for someone else that fit their criteria better, and had an absolute fit. Don't know if you read my Sawdust Saga post at any point but it's him. There's more details there, but literally he would hit on everyone IC in some way when given an opportunity, and if/when they eventually didn't bite because of reasons (preferences, culture, marital status, sexuality, etc) he'd freak out IC and do any number of things from run away, destroy property, to straight up murder hobo and then get upset when we clapped him back for it because you can't just murder NPCs in town because someone said they werent DTF your psycho-obsessive edgelord OC.

It's bad in my community with that similar trope; it seems to either be bragging rights or some kind of smut-trophy? Eeeh. It's weird.  \n\n\nAs for setting up characters to not have a dependency, I learned that the hard way. My main was scene-locked for well over a year and I had to eventually reclaim the character. Even then, most people in that community don't finish anything they start. I had one scene with a guy that never taught my character how to use a gun because he needed another way to defend himself without magic. Another of the same premise, but was a fighter and was like \"Here's my abs, worship me\" kind of energy that ultimately led nowhere. Another instance with someone he was shipped with to teach him how to fight/spar and that was essentially handwaived. Like... So many things that weren't developed. It really annoyed me when they'd come to me for my character teaching them magic and then them wanting to handwaive it because 'magic r fast' there. Unless it was obvious they were going to get smut, then they were ALL into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't read the Sawdust Saga yet, but that guy sounds like a real winner. I don't really get people who get that obsessed with having their characters with someone. In my character's situation, it doesn't matter if the character he's currently linked to gets filled as a romance; there's character development either *way*. That's what I look for. But to go off godmodding the NPCs (and the rules) like that because they couldn't get it is just... It makes me glad I've steered away from it for the most part until there's actual chemistry there. People don't even get to first base on the first date with my characters. If they were hit on? Unless I know the person OOCly where it'd be funny for my characters to become walking disasters (it's happened and I love that trope), they really get \"No thanks, I have to go now.\" They get so upset when their lines just don't work. xD",

            "body": "I'll have to look for it! :D  \n\n\nAnd there was a lot who would. Some wouldn't even get the concepts of magic right. For instance there's this guy who fancies himself to be a banshee who uses glamours to be something that his original character concept wasn't. Not only does he completely butcher the entire concept of banshees and their lore, he thinks that illusion magic crams all your organs together and mashes you up into a 'normal body'. That's not the actual story though. That's to give you an idea of what this guy is like (he's also the same gross guy I mentioned in another thread who would try to age characters down so he could have his way with them, talk about yikes).  \n\n\nThe actual story was that he was in a group event and my character was working on a rather intense spell. Trying to locate someone without very specific key items and the player that was missing and I were working together to coordinate what would happen. He and I were always on the same page and we actually had a really good RP partner dynamic after this whole thing. I'm getting ahead of myself there. So, I'm going into details. The spell components, interacting with them, giving them lore of these mechanics through descriptions and how they corelate to portions of the spell. The spell of course would fail because they couldn't get anything of what my character needed, but for how much their characters talked about how they knew magic... They really didn't know magic as they couldn't stop the spell. There was a specific object they were flat out, told very plainly, \"Break this if something goes wrong.\" They couldn't even do that.  \n\n\nYou know, actually reading all that back? I kind of know why they handwaive magic. It's because it's a community that refuses to do it's own research due to the 'everything is true' premise, so they come up with the most lorebreaking things in the game, let alone it's setting. Talk about triple yikes. xD",

Yeah. Sometimes magic can be waved off because magic and the system itself isn't as important as other things happening as long as limits are made. Like DnD.\n\nOther times, it helps others who may not know the system yet to SEE someone utilize it so they can become more familiar with it. It's the reason I made a lot of detailed posts about some categories of scifi tech in another group I made to make sure everyone knew how it worked and why, because I have very specific rules for it AND even if the details are something they don't care to remember, it's something the MODS need to have a reference point to because in meta, they have to keep track of things.\n\nSpecifically, certain types of genetic modification and cybernetic enhancements have special categories that are listed full face as being heavily monitored by what's know in universe as the Repo Team. It's not a completely hard rule set to follow if someone has an interesting idea for abusing the power system as long as they talk to the mods about it first. The rules are just there to dissuade the people that end up as the catalysts of this subreddit from pulling stunts and abusing the system in a way that can be dealt with in and out of story.\n\nIf someone doesn't read that and they end up getting their super expensive nuclear powered robot arm repossessed by the SWAT team because they thought harassing a bunch of civvies with a laser gun for no reason except sCiEnCe then that's their fault.\n\nSame goes for magic systems. How does the spell work? What if it backfires? What's the success rate and limits? It all gets put out there for them to see because no two systems are exactly the same and if they screw that up then that's no one's fault but theirs because they couldn't be bothered to read.",

Sometimes even having sub-plots to figure out why it backfired and how something *else* worked into it. I often get deeper into my character that way because it explores their own potential as well as really engaging with the system itself. Testing it's limitations and even creating small off-shoots where theories of magic can also be expanded on.  \n\n\nBut what you say about the rules being there, it really does dissuade the people that end up here. For me there's more to magic than just the power fantasy. I often look at it as the opposite because there's so much potential for a lot of development; character development, mechanical development, world building, as well as story advancement. I feel like I'm sometimes one of the odd ones of like \"YES! It backfired! JUST LET ME GET MY DICE!\" It surprises the good writers that I've written with because I've got back-systems like that where I often like the backfires more than actually succeeding. It all just intersects. More often than not, though, I'm finding that to be kind of a niche thing.  \n\n\nAnd I really, *really* feel that with mods. This community 'has' mods, but the ones that are still there basically do nothing but /lurk. I honestly wonder sometimes how it got that bad and what it would've been like if the management team had been the original people who ran the community before. They policed RP pretty well when it came to things like this and was much before my time that I got involved with that video game. At the time I got in, it was so new that original content creators were still working with the rules of the meta prior, but they left. I get why they did after all my time was spent trying to keep some level of sensibility in the community with my plots.",
