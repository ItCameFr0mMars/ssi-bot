I made concessions for \"okay I guess \\[username mcgee\\] is nervous, I'll have a friend talk to them\" and holy *shit* they drew it out for three weeks with inane dodging and 'im not ready' and counter questions but could accuse me of 'sabotaging' their Rp to my friend in DMs.  Somehow thought an officer of my project wouldn't also talk to me about these things.\n\nWas this person also a Paragon of Morality type by any chance?  With the guy I ran into his character was his purity sue they'd use to try and force other characters to Play Nice when he didn't get his way, constant bitching about evil ic choices etc.  It was all a bunch of Im Right shit to sate their ego, not actually about being nice, dude just wanted to impose ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What's notable is that she was eventually (supposedly) asked to leave her own roleplay for trying to kick another member out for behavior she didn't agree with.\n\nlol",

            "body": "In group roleplays, there will always be some people whose writing style isn't really your thing, who writes stuff that you find a little questionable or who you find a bit annoying OC. I think that one of the most important aspects that you have to learn to deal with when you do group roleplays. Unfortunately, many people seem to be completely unable to do so. If people agree to the group roleplay's rules, there is simply no need to add your own 'moral rules' and start seeking revenge against the members who don't want to follow them. If there is too much questionable content in the roleplay for you, it's your turn to simply not get involved with the storylines of these members or to leave, in my opinion. It's a case of 'You signed up for this, I don't know what you expected.' Yes, it's okay to talk to the mods when you have a problem with the roleplay or some members, but some people can't differentiate between 'This is bad roleplaying behavior and the mods should do something' and 'this person writes stuff that I don't care about/I don't think we would be compatible if we ever wrote together.' \r  \nThis reminds me of a specific girl I met in a group roleplay. She seemed quite nice at first...but every case of 'I personally don't really enjoy the writing style of these person/They are a bit cringey in the OC chat' turned into '...so they are probably also a bad person.' She would go out of her way to start drama with them, and every time someone (innocently) mentioned 'my storyline with Steve is getting so good right now!' she would make sure that this person knew that Steve is probably a bad person via private messages. It killed the good atmosphere of the group roleplay, because when there was zero proof of him being an asshole, and I would be like 'Oh, I think he's okay, I enjoy writing with him.' she would interpret that as me 'choosing him over her' and act offended and sad. This lead to her friends taking her side all the time, especially when they didn't know the other person that well, because they wanted to avoid her being disappointed with them. I later stopped any ooc conversations we had going on because I realized how manipulative that was. But she was very good at playing the poor girl whose mental health was in danger because of (group member she didn't even interact with and who didn't say anything that was super controversial), and her friends always made any issue out to be 'we have to protect her, she shouldn't be sad! Who cares about (group member)?'\r  \nShe never flat out lied about what her 'targets' did to her, but always cleverly insinuated that there was something bad going on that she wouldn't tell you, using a lot of words like 'probably' or 'I could imagine that he...'. If you confronted her and asked her what exactly the person did wrong, she would then confess that is was just a weird gut feeling and nothing had really happened. Don't get me wrong, it's her right to be uncomfortable with someone and to not want to interact with them, but trying to get everyone else to not interact with them? That's just so mean. Unfortunately, the other group members were either:\r  \n\\-newbies who hadn't realized this pattern of behavior and simply believed every word she said, because she was super nice and they thought 'there has to be something wrong with the other person, she is so nice and would never harm someone for no reason'\r  \n\\-her friends who always took her side to avoid drama\r  \n\\-people who didn't know her 'targets' well and therefore didn't want to get involved and take a side\r  \n\\-people who simply didn't gave fuck about anything that was going on behind the scenes\r  \n\r\n\nHer targets were often people who seemed genuinely friendly, but not that skilled socially.",
