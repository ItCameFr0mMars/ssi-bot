I thought it might've been because it was cringey or overdone, but the amount of creeps who want it for fetishy purposes makes a lot of sense.\n\n7.: This is sadly the reality of roleplay. Even if you have the patience of a saint, it's just as likely that they'll never respond over randomly popping in one day. A lot of decent partners can just end up taking a long time due to life or burnout. Waiting is really the only option for keeping a decent partner who does this (and a lot of them do because honestly, it's pretty natural to burnout and ghosting has become a normal occurrence whether it's morally right or not).\n\nI'm not sure what other hobbies you have because roleplay and writing do take up a lot of time, but hope you have plenty of time now to delve into other things you like! Roleplay can be very job-like and if you quit, more power to you!",

            "body": "Hot take here, but trying to treat F-list as a traditional RP search is asking for a bad time. It's a wild west of RP, where you can find anything but also subject yourself to being approached by everything. Most vets know this and it has kinda created a certain self-contained culture. Being a user myself in the past, the amount of RP you actually do/want to do will pale compared to the amount of people you'll need to block, avoid, and the amount of idiots that will approach. Change is nigh impossible for a site like that, it is just how it is.\n\nThat and in the objective of fetish, no one is going to do a role-play that doesn't cater to something they are looking for. Negotiation always has to take place if the kinks don't match up completely, it has to be a give and take or you'll frankly be left on the sidelines. The more unique or obscure the kink, the more you'll have to negotiate. \n\nI could rant for a while about this site and, while you clearly stated you're done, my biggest advice if you ever try again is to not use the ad feature. People don't read, they don't care. They click the profile link, see if your character is attractive, and then read maybe a few words before jumping into your PMs. It can work if you're willing to weed out dozens of people, but that is how it is.\n\nUsing the underrated search function and keeping an eye out for profiles that cater to you is a much more worthwhile endeavor. Especially if you're a more submissive kink set, boldness and approaching will always pay off more given there is a metric fuckton more subs then doms. People who aren't looking at that moment but you message or approach anyway with 'hey your profile is really nice, I know you're not looking but I wanted to let you know I bookmarked you and would love to discuss some play sometime featuring so and so kinks' may just appreciate it enough to turn a 180 on their mood to RP or even just actually strongly consider doing something in the future.\n\nBut hey, I feel you on being discouraged and wish you luck in whatever endeavors you choose to follow now.",

I'm Tatters in most places, this isn't hard!\n\nOff-topic OP but I've met people who've gotten their nose out of joint for referring to them by their character's name and they'll screech **\"doN'T cALL Me by My chaRACteR'S NaMe!!!!\"** but when I ask \"What do you wish to be called?\" they're like \"**Durrrr...I dunno!**\"\n\nBack on topic? It's F-list OP! Some people on that site like to treat the website like a dating site and some of them had issues with boundaries. They can't separate IC from OOC, which I've recently had issues with. It's like that website breeds creeps and they only seek samey, cookie-cutter, hypersexualized characters that aren't well written or interesting.\n\nThese people aren't original but they have the balls to crap all over my character in a very condescending manner and it makes me so angry.\n\nThey're like adult children!

As for breeding, yeah I admit on the odd time I go ad hunting(Which isn't much cause I'm tired of writing paragraph essay introductions and not even getting a \"No thanks\") I often skip ERP ads if I see \"No breeding\", it's a kink of mine and unless I can still go *inside* and we simply make an excuse for it not being fertile then I skip it! I'll wear protection and pull out irl but it just kills fantasy mood for me\\~\n2. Similar boat, I often get Pokemon fans that know nothing beyond gen 1(Despite my ad stating that I find Kanto and Johto BORING to play out in a story!)\n3. That's odd... but I guess some guys are desperate? I'm a dom but don't mind playing sub on a few occasions if they *politely* request and aren't just hijackers that ask right off the bat and act as if they have the high ground.\n4. Oh yes, I get this too. I NEVER force public or breeding since I know they're iffy with some people but I often request positioning that aren't even out there or weird and people just outright ignore it and go \"Please force me against the bed, daddy! :3\". \"Woof\" \"Yeeeha!\" (Guess which ones? haha)\n5. Well yeah, that's the typical life for a fandom RPer like us. Sometimes you could get three responses in a day, sometimes it can take two weeks to get a proper response! And then the person goes \"Herrr you start!\" and types \\*I see you walking and wave\\* \"Hi there hot stuff!\" in response (Immediately facepalm and block. I even confronted one person and asked why they aren't typing like they're writing a novel or a school paper and y'know what I got in return? \"Every one else I've rped with does this\". I asked if they'd be willing to try it my way and roleplay more properly as \\*\\*'s really kill the RP mood for me. \"Nah\", and that was the last time I decided to talk with those people. It's straight to Blocksville now!)\n6. Well some people do seek out partners that are willing to be friends, I'm in that boat but I never engage with OOC unless the other starts. Certainly never calling them 'cute', it's creepy!\n7. Yeah same, it fucking sucks! Yet the \\*smiles\\* or the one liners don't go away and needlessly poke you after five minutes \ud83d\ude44\n\nI'm about to call it quits too",

(Unless the mods wrongly assumed diapers = underage for your ads)\n\nI agree that the on-site rules have gotten out of hand. Rule 1 specifies that no self-inserts are allowed, which is what you were referring to with OCs requiring refs. It makes it so that no one can brainstorm an OC with someone pre-roleplay. According to the mods, the rule prevents the low-effort self-insert ads, but... I don't know, I feel they're too strict about it. As for \"unwritten rule forbidding the use of refs\" I'm not sure but ik that they also banned Picrew refs\n\nI don't blame you at all for wanting to end your RP search.
