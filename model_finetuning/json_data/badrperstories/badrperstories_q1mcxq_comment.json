            "body": "Practice, practice, practice and lots of reading (To become novella) It's natural to get stuck along the way (especially if you struggle to read because reading even fanfics provides some source of inspiration for your writing to improve) but writing a ton is all the more beneficial in the long run! Adding to this... While writing a reply, if you want a colorful vocabulary, read a dictionary every now and then! Google search is your best friend. Look up a word you commonly use and see if there's better or different ways to write it. A larger vocabulary can really make your writing pop, just make sure it doesn't come across as too flowery (Although I don't think there's anything wrong with flowery writing styles if both you and your roleplay partner love it)\n\nSecondly, self-awareness. For roleplay, this is 100% the most critical skill to have besides the willingness to change... and that's because regardless of whatever tips you receive, you can't put them to good use if you're not aware of your own actions! And trust me, there's lots of people that are unaware of their own flaws and go on ranting about the same flaws that they experience from other roleplayers. Do a little self-reflection every now and then, and most importantly... ask the people you are roleplaying with! Although, not everyone might be entirely upfront with you, an outside perspective from someone who reads your writing is the best way to start becoming more aware of any mistakes you've been making.",

            "body": "Read books, write with passion, never use the excuse of 'Idk what what are you looking for' and most importantly follow the golden rule of improv being 'Yes, and...'\n\nBeing a good roleplayer isn't hard, in fact it's pretty damn easy. The fact you write a good chunk and consider your character's surroundings and thoughts means you accomplished the hardest part. However it will most likely not stop ghosting, no matter how good you are if a partner has/can ghost they will if they want to. Not trying to be a pessimist but that's just how it is. \n\nMost of my advice relates to OOC and planning, but in general don't be a creep and always be willing to negotiate. Never approach someone without a solid idea to pitch and never just relegate yourself to a spectator role, always try to contribute to a plot. Also, from experience mostly as a 'reciever', don't dish out your life story in the first five minutes of meeting someone especially if it's depressive and/or sad. Most people are here to write and would rather get to know their partner and RP a bit before becoming hired on as a free therapist. Some confuse new role-play partners with counslers or as 'new best friends' and that can easily spur an immediate desire to back away.",

Read, read, read, and I often use things like TMI questionnaires, get in the mind of my characters and have them fill them out if they're applicable to the setting.

I felt like my writing was much too short so here\u2019s what I did;\n\nStudying: I know most of us aren\u2019t in school anymore but whipping out a dictionary or reading long books will do you great. I read the good old fashioned Twilight Saga to help discover my writing style. As I\u2019m reading books, I like to break the characters down as if I were roleplaying, which characters are my partners and which ones are mine. If my part looks too short, I\u2019ll try to break it down on how I can enlarge it. Writing prompts weekly will also help a ton, think of prompts or get a generator and start writing. Write in different styles! Step outta your comfort zone. All though your probably won\u2019t use half the things you use in your writing, it will definitely help! \n\nAlso, writing on a Google doc with grammatically will make your writing seem longer since it will let you choose bigger words, once you put it into whatever app you Roleplay in, it will seem much longer.",

            "body": "\nWow! I am amazed at the treasure trove that I have stumbled upon. I have read it over and over again, and have incorporated some and would like to incorporate others. A total eye opener for me, since many areas were either not known or ignored.\n\nAs user u/Waythis has stated, there is no RP which is \u2018 ghosting \u2018 proof, so the best that I aim for is a long and satisfying RP.  An effort towards developing a great story and overall getting to know the other person.  In my personal experience, the first time RP-ing with an user can be a little awkward. But when we decide to jump onto another subsequent RP, I have found the posts intense and if NSFW elements involved, writings more passionate. Even I have observed that my OC would do things which  I know the other user finds delightful , though I don\u2019t know if it is actually good or bad!! \n\nOver time I have found myself writing down a set of questions to ask the other user, before jumping into the RP.  There had been many instances when the prompt had not been  clear and it was my mistake not to clarify the doubts that I had, resulting in not so great RP experiences. We both were at different pages altogether! Still the set of questions regarding their characters, plots and specifically the writing styles have helped.  Plus improvising all the way, is one of the best ways. I also ask the other player, what do you expect from me? Helps to get much clarity.\n\nRecently I have started taking notes about the OC, plot and the user itself!  As u/ShadowhuntingGaymer has pointed out, keeping track of scenes and storyline is important. Else many times we have been just beating around the bush! The idea of using questionnaires  and writing programs is something totally new to me and I would explore the same. I am sure many important pointers would be picked up by me.\n\nI would totally agree with u/Phoenician-Purple  , that novella is NOT the most desired style of writing.  But if I do not elaborate on a scene or about the character, times I find myself feeling incomplete.  Over time I have tried to adjust and make posts more relevant, but the thoughts going through the mind of my OC, his/her  reaction to the surroundings just need to come out in my post! Sigh!  \n\nPlus I would like to draw analogy to water, which takes the shape of the container in which  it is put. I too wish to be in that league, where I can improvise and adjust to the other users writing style instantly. atleast somewhere near, if not fully!\n\nReading and nowadays listening to audio books or podcasts has never ceased. The genres and authors have changed , but the habit remains. From the likes of Nancy Drew, Famous Five to Sidney Sheldon , Harold Robbins to Louis L\u2019amor , Michael Crichton to the classics like Robinson Crusoe, Shakespeare, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling,  Mark Twain and a host of others have been a constant favourite. Nowadays its all about trilogy and saga, so have resorted to audio books instead. \n\n\n\nPractice makes an individual perfect, and that\u2019s what I am doing u/AestheticMuffin . Writing, reading over and over again, make it +2 times before replying  or even more before posting a prompt has minimized mistakes and grammatical errors. Plus rephrasing sentences has allowed to be within the word limit or not become very long.  The dictionary or synonym list has been of great help.  I just keep it handy! \n\n*** Advice on what books to read will be helpful and appreciated.",

For me it really helps to not only connect with the character and story but to feelnat least some kinship with the people I'm interacting with. Brainstorming and talking about scenarios or plot points sometimes ahead of time really helps me come up with good material. That could just be me but if I can get excited with just ideas bouncing around my posts will be better. Also along with reading I find that making music Playlists is a fabulous inspiration. Helps connect and get a real vibe for your character.  Size of a post can be great if it's full of important things but size isn't everything. If it's full of unnecessary fluff or fillers or looks like a thesaurus threw up it'll kill the post.",

            "body": "Statistically, you have two choices: roleplays that end, or roleplays that are long. Most lengthy RPs do not end, they *stop*, for whatever reason. \n\nMy advice (for long term) is thinking about roleplay as a journey, not a destination. Make friends if that's your jam, write some great scenes, but don't get too invested in any one particular storyline, because it can just stop for *whatever* reason, without an ending or closure, and that's just how it goes.\n\nCharacter advice: have your characters be wrong, sometimes. Have them not immediately suspect the shady character is shady. Have them not be suspicious of someone lying to their face. Have them make the wrong choice completely of their own accord and *not* be forgiven or vindicated later, and have them face consequences of making that choice. \n\nWrite characters who filter what they're saying. Most people can't and/or won't just identify what they want/need/etc with perfect accuracy. We lie. We lie by omission. We misdirect. We filter. We deflect and project and do everything possible to protect our ego. We *perform* in front of certain people/audiences. We tell different people in our lives different narratives about ourselves.  Sometimes, we don't have the words to say what we're thinking or feeling, and either lie out of convenience, or we say nothing at all. I started writing much better (and more interesting!) characters when I started writing liars.",
