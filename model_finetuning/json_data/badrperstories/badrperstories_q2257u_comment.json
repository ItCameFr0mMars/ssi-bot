            "body": "Seamus here (the co-admin during all of this) - this post really could have been twice as long, but it was already a saga. The amount of vitriol this person put into the world with her constant complaints and pessimism really should have broken us a lot sooner than it did. No one was exempt from it, whether it was us, her real life friends, or her roomate(s). There was never a day where she wasn\u2019t upset with someone, jealous or bitter about something, or just in an unpleasant mood. Hindsight makes it difficult to see what we kept holding onto, exactly, but at the time it felt like there were reasons to keep going. We let ourselves get buried in a whole smorgasbord of red flags.",

            "body": "Holy shit, I could not stop reading this. What a RIDE. The first half reminded me of someone that I ran into, oh, about two years ago? \n\nShe approached me for a ship, I said sure. A couple of weeks down the road, she suggested we expand it into a poly ship with a third player. I said sure, depending on chemistry. We formed a group DM for the three of us and the third person turned out to be a great person with a character that we plotted to have, in my opinion, a pretty interesting dynamic. \n\nA few weeks down the line, she accused us of trying to freeze her out of our poly ship because the third person and I were talking about headcanons and future plots on our own when they just involved our characters. *She got mad that we had headcanons about our characters' relationship that didn't involve her character.* \n\nHer meltdown led to both of us backing out of the ship. She bitched about it to half the site but never once owned up to her own behaviour. I left the site and it imploded shortly after because of her drama. I felt bad for the other two admins, they seemed pretty blindsided by all the shit she'd pulled with the members. \n\nI'm glad you and Seamus managed to move past Dina's craziness and reclaim the characters that were involved in all that mess. I hope you never have to deal with that kind of bullshit again.",

OP and I talked about her in depth after I made a similar post, but we basically come to find out she was the exact same person who screwed us both over \u2014including you :(. For me she preyed in the fact I was a hell of a lot younger and forced me into sexual situations I was never comfortable with (briefly as a minor as well) and also lied about her personal information and used a fake name. I had the pleasure of dealing with Ms. Dina alone on Discord, but oh boy I had no clue she was up to this shit on different platforms as well. I also met her in 2019 and I also got the constant complaints of her roommate and (I think it was like Alyssa something?) and others in her life. Or her turning her verbal onslaught onto me (although I thought at the time I must of been the only one out of her partners getting this sort of treatment). I also ignored the glaring red flags until it all cumulative to a boiling point. She really was a great writer and why I stayed as long as I did when I should of just left. It scares me one how many other people she fucked up if I was able to find other victims of her madness this easily.",

Dina would have a flash of insight and apologize to me, or seem to understand, but by the next day she would have talked herself back out of it and decided she was blameless after all because her roommate said so. It made us both realize that anyone who isn't able to take responsibility for their own behavior is probably the biggest red flag of all. Just 0 self-awareness.\n\nUgh, that sounds terrible. I'm so glad that we never even attempted a poly ship with her. The thought of the three of us having to navigate a romantic ship after she threw tantrums over \\*brothers\\* is... horrible, LOL. It would have ended BADLY, I'm sure.\n\nShe caused a lot of issues with the members because of her behavior. I didn't detail any of those things here, though. It was mainly her instigating arguments over whether or not a certain movie is bad or being rude about another member's characterization/OC. Just... mean things. \n\nThank you! Same to you! Jealousy can be poisonous, especially when people are unwilling to acknowledge it and blame other people for \"making\" them jealous. She did this a lot. I think there's a common attitude in the rpc that jealousy is \"bad\" or \"toxic\", which - yes, it can be, but jealousy is also a healthy emotion that can be handled maturely. If she'd come to you and said, \"hey, I know this is silly, but I'm a feeling insecure and a little jealous that I didn't get to be part of the headcanons you guys made. Can we make our own headcanons?\" it would be a different story, I'm sure. Offering a solution and not blaming YOU. Similarly, if she'd come to us and said that she felt jealous, I would have been a lot more understanding and worked to find a solution together.",

I would read that if it was a book honestly. \n\nOut of all of your stories I've heard, definitely the worst one, and I'm so sorry that you had to deal with a person like that. Reading it I actually began to think I'd had a very similar experience as the other user talked about here in the comments, and from your post as well. \n\nIt's unfortunate you had to deal with her, as well as in the midst of the whole Iris drama that only ended up complicating things further and making it worse. \n\nBut honestly, I'm so sorry you had to go through that and that it affected the both of you so badly. My heart and love goes out to the both of you; but within that, I'm so glad you had each other and that you guys were and have remained friends, as well as being able to continue with your characters. \n\nAlso, please don't blame yourselves at all. Hindsight is a wonder, so don't blame yourself for the things you didn't do or should have done or could/should have done better, because you were just doing the best you could or thought you could do in that moment. Which is pretty commendable.\n\nI truly truly hope one day you can fully move past your experience, where she's nothing more than an unfortunate memory, or someone you just don't even think about. \n\nBut I also have to ask...got anymore? Although for your sake, I really hope you don't, because I can only imagine how bad it was and possible is on your mental health to have to relive your bad experiences.\n\nBut really, anymore stories?",

            "body": "My god, I can honestly sympathize with some of the stuff here over the last two years of my issues in an MMO community. I read all of it. Seamus and you had the patience of saints here.   \n\n\nHere's where I can really sympathize.   \n\n\nFirst with Seamus;  \nNot only did Dina hyperfocus the ship, but she hyperfocused the person behind the character. It makes me feel really uncomfortable when people become possessive over a person after having a character that's shipped with one of theirs. Even more so when they start throwing all their alts at that person's alts. It really feels like they're trying to compensate for something they often lack IRL, which is a real relationship.  \n\n\nWith you, I sympathize with the bit of Dina going to you and constantly complaining about a friend of yours for over two decades. That's nothing to scoff about and it's like she's overstepping a very real, solid friendship there. I could understand if he was doing something like content theft, or something heinous or nefarious, but from the story? That's not him. You know him. Her only reason to complain was because he wasn't feeling it? I wonder why... He was being creatively suffocated from something he originally seemed to have planned out and when he wouldn't listen to her, I'm willing to bet she went to you to complain to twist his ear into doing what she wanted to do. Even though I don't know you, I'm proud you didn't give in and stayed solid to Seamus.  \n\n\nWith Dina playing the smear campaign with other groups though? I said it earlier, but oh my god. I was actually just about to get into the tumblr fandom RP setting. Now I'm kind of skeptical. Like... MMMM. I don't know if I could tolerate another two years of insanity with someone who not only can't respect shipping boundaries, but just blatantly being a sociopath.  \n\n\nI'm really sorry to you, Seamus, and TheTownsLore for being affected by her. Y'all deserved (and still deserve) better than that.",

She'd share her problems with me and I tried to comfort her and she in her own way would try to comfort me until one day she switched off. Being extremely passive agressive which I brushed off as a joke but it was really taking my mental health down, it got to the point where I wanted to politely ask them to stop and before I could I had an anxiety attack.
