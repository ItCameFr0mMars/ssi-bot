If the other player was a dead fish or a pillow princess, that's a problem (and it ought to be addressed OOC), but there isn't any in-text confirmation that this was the case.\n\nIn a 1x1, I *really* do not expect to be having to fight for dominance with my partner's prolific cast of side characters. I'd bow out, too, because I want to write with someone interested in writing with my characters, and not feel like an interloper in someone's novel.\n\nI'm pretty sympathetic with the other side of this as-written. If someone was so interested in what their own characters were doing that they wrote an entire post that didn't involve my character at all, I'd be pretty annoyed. Unless it was explicitly stated that this was going to be a large ensemble cast on both sides, I don't understand why the partner should be penalized/ignored/written out of the scene for not writing more characters.\n\nIn general I think this was a bad match with poor communication and/or miscommunication about the nature of the side characters and the expanse of the story's cast. OP didn't do anything *wrong* by wanting to write a big cast of characters, but they'll probably want to find someone who tackles large casts with equal enthusiasm.\n\nAlso, seriously, don't write posts that don't involve your partners' characters as a bonafide IC response. I have a partner who will do 'intermission' posts when they're writing stuff that takes place between scenes that doesn't involve my characters, and the first time they did it, they made it clear that they didn't expect me to respond to that type of post, because there wasn't much to respond to. I have another partner who will sometimes warn me a post is \"self-indulgent\" if it involves a lot of one-sided IC stuff, but even then they give me something to work with.\n\nIf you and your partner are having a hard time bringing the action together, or your partner is being uncooperative in moving the scene forward or isn't yes-and-ing the scene, it's probably time for an OOC chat, but it's pretty off-putting to write a response that doesn't involve them *at all* and then pass the baton like \"well, up to you to figure out how to include yourself, all my characters are doing just fine without you.\"",

I'm someone who always writes multiple OCs and NPCs in a roleplay, but I mostly only write the scenes where they interact with the other writer's characters or main character. It never happened to me that I completely forgot including their character in a reply, even if the other person only wrote one character and I wrote multiple characters. This normally doesn't happen, especially if you say 'apparently neglect to write' and it doesn't sound like these scenes where the characters were alone were planned with them. Even if it was planned, it has to be mentioned, like 'Hey the next reply is only worldbuilding, please don't wonder why it's only my characters interacting with each other.' because not every writer is used to this. It makes me wonder if their character really was not that important for the narrative you wanted to create. \n\nProblems like this should be discussed beforehand. Did you tell them that you wanted them to write multiple characters and that your other characters were not NPCs/OCs both of you could use? Because on a lot of roleplaying sites, the standard is: each person writes their main character, and there are some NPCs everyone can use. Maybe they were confused, overwhelmed, and thought that one of your characters was also an NPC. I read one of your old ads and it doesn't specify that you want to write multiple main/important characters, or that you want your partner to do so. This definitely something that you should discuss beforehand, because many people are not up for it. No amount of 'write your own secondary characters if you want more interaction' is going to change that.  There is definitely a lack of communication here. I know many people who would be a bit... weirded out by joining a roleplay where they are suddenly expected to write multiple other characters if they want to have something to interact to, or where there partner basically forgets to include their main character in a reply.\n\nIt just seems like you two have very different writing styles, and therefore, I can also get where the other person is coming from.",

            "body": "Yeah, it's just a difference in writing style. In one (German) forum I was in, almost everyone always wrote multiple characters, and that is where I learned about roleplay etiquette, how to write a roleplay and so on. When I searched for a new roleplaying site and found one, most people only wrote one main character and no other important characters at all. When I told them that I wanted to write multiple characters, some even asked me how that worked. They didn't even think of including anything about this in their searches, it was just common sense to them that this is how it's done. If someone just wrote a reply without their character, they would probably lose their minds. It was often people who used phrases like 'doubling' when they meant that wanted to write more than one (but still only two) characters. I'm not saying that this writing style is worse, I know many very talented writer's and good roleplayers who exclusively write like this, it's just a different preference. It's not really an issue if both of the writers are on the same page about that.\n\nI think when you're used to only one character, it can be pretty hard to adapt. At first, they might've thought that they can do it, or that it'll be fine when they just write one character, but when you wrote a reply which didn't even include their character at all, they probably lost interest because they thought that your characters would be better of just interacting with each other. Dealing with so many characters at once can be quite challenging and overwhelming, especially if you're not used to it. You have to keep in mind that you already know your characters and your partner still has to get to know them, and I admit when people introduce a big cast of characters in the very early on it sometimes takes a while until I can tell them apart. \nBut yeah, they shouldn't have blown up on you. They were probably really frustrated and didn't know how to voice their frustration better. And it can be quite hard. Imagine if you were only used to writing one character, and all the other people you interact with do the same, and someone you write with introduces a big cast of characters, and they seem to add so much more to the narrative than you're capable of. I can see were they're coming from when they said you were taking over the narrative, although it is unfair when you see it from your point of view where this writing style is the default.\n\n I mean, in the end they told you what their problem was: that you're writing much more characters than they did, and they felt that   couldn#t add as much to the narrative as you did. Just adding secondary characters sounds easy, but it seems obvious that they weren't used to this. This is the point were both of you should've realized: you're simply not a match, because your writing styles are just so different.",

Before then they were given many threads to interact with.\n\nIf there was an issue with that, they should have spoken up about the cast count. Maybe it's a preference conflict but my reading of the situation given is that the other partner didn't speak up about the character count being a problem and had a disproportionate fit that one message didn't have leads in it out of the entire roleplay.",

            "body": "Groups are really different dynamics from 1x1 though, because a group is not two people agreeing to roleplay a plot together, it's a bunch of people thrown into a scenario deciding who to roleplay with and *how*.\n\nI do both. In group RPs, no one owes anyone else the time of day, so that dynamic does develop. People have to write interesting characters and put in the work to get themselves involved in the storyline, otherwise they'll be drowned out in the noise. But this dynamic emerges because group members who are not administrators have no control over who has been let into the group, so it's considered acceptable to not write with all the members in a group. I didn't vet the members in the group and have no obligation to them beyond the perfunctory requirement to not be a complete asshole. The admins can let whomever they want into the RP, but this does not obligate me to play with them. (This is also why I don't admin anymore. I don't like 'having' to RP with someone.)\n\n1x1 is wildly different. You don't get involved in a 1x1 without presumably having a degree of *hypothetical* interest in writing with *this* person, specifically, and *their* characters, specifically. You can't apply group dynamics to 1x1, because in 1x1 you have vetted the other person and made the tacit agreement that you're going to be roleplaying with one another. If you don't write with them, it's not like the other player can go off and find someone else in-universe to play ball. These two people are the entire roleplay. If OP doesn't *want* to write with the other player and their character, why are they even doing this?\n\nThere's plenty of room for miscommunication. It appears that OP's partner thought the other characters in the group were NPCs. Where the communication lapsed, I can't say, but it doesn't seem like they understood they were going to be playing against an ensemble cast of PCs and then be expected to come up with their own cast of player characters. Maybe they don't want to write a ton of PCs to jockey for OP's attention. I'll make player characters if they have a defined role in the narrative, but I'm not going to make up PCs just to occupy space in the story because my partner can't be fussed to pay attention to my OC because they like their characters better. It really sounds like OP preferred writing by themselves than with this other player. Which...it happens. I've certainly met people I actively don't want to RP with, but I explain this to them with my words, not by ignoring their character. This isn't high school.\n\nFor me there's no scenario where I'm okay with being ignored/written out of the scene IC, even if it's \"only one\" message. Only difference between me and OP's partner is I wouldn't stick around to complain about it, I'd just be like \"Yeah, we're done here, bye.\"",
