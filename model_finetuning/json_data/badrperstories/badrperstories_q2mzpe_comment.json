            "body": "Zelda is the best name and Zelda Fitzgerald is a QUEEN\n\nThat being said\n\nWe'd always been very lucky in the Tumblr RP Community when it came to members, I have to say, considering the amount of people that passed through the game over the course of how long we were active. Our game was 18+, but most of the members were in their mid 20s to early 30s, so there was an air of maturity that was unique. I don't think any of us were prepared for Kyle. \n\nAnd UNFORTUNATELY, he was in my time zone, so I'd be bombarded with a tantrum right after the OP went to SLEEP and in the morning he'd have to wake up to a million messages of me detailing the drama he missed. \n\nFor those of you who read my previous posts, all of this happened in the same time frame of the BIG drama of part 3, so we had a lot on our plates. \n\nKyle also frequently messaged us personally on discord to deal with admin issues when this was explicitly stated in our rules as not okay. This was something that other members would do, though, and we had to post reminds constantly that admin issues were only to be handled on the admin blog. \n\nFor those of you wondering how members could double check whether or not their requests for hiatuses were seen, we had a page where we listed all members on hiatus and a cut off time for when those hiatuses could be submitted. For example - you could submit a hiatus up to two hours before a check was posted. This gives us time to update the page.\n\nOf course, this couldn't always be done, but we had situations where emergencies came up and members would always be allowed to return under those circumstances. It happens. \n\nThe biggest thing with Kyle was the way he handled admin interactions. Even with screenshots, he would argue with us about the appropriateness of his behavior and deny making people feel uncomfortable.\n\nMost of our members didn't want to cause trouble and would be reluctant to come to us with an official complaint because of that, but getting secondhand information was always more frustrating because we had no grounds to strike that person. We placed a heavy emphasis on being fair admins and not putting undue credence in rumors, or taking action prematurely and without all of the information, but there were rare occasions when it got us into situations like this and ughhhh.",

I will always respect him for being mature and adaptable during everything that happened with Iris. He granted people a lot more leeway than they were willing to give to him, and it takes a strong person to do that.",

I'm essentially your biggest and first fan, isn't that something? \n\nKevin seems like an incredibly annoying person to deal with, so once again, my congratulations to you both for dealing with him as well as you did. I would have just ended up getting really pissed off and just given up being civil, but that's just me! So good on you both!\n\nThe fact that so much happened while also dealing with part 3 is honestly saddening. It makes an already difficult situation so. Much. Harder. So again, good on you both for pushing through. \n\nI really just can't wait for the next 'episode', because I love hearing these stories so much. Must have been a very interesting time. Although, you guys should definitely post some of the better stories on the r/GreatRperStories subreddit, otherwise it'll start to seem like the entire thing sucked",
