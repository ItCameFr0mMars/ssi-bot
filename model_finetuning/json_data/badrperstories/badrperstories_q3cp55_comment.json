No, it's stuck up but that's not technically wrong by any means. \n\nThis all being said you can't get mad at people for not living up to expectations they don't know you have. \n\nAlso, crafting a super special, intriguing and informative intro for every single person is as exhausting as reading a ton of copy and paste responses, ESPECIALLY if you don't get a reply even though you put in the effort. \n\nI make whole new ocs for every rp, so that's my cash in this particular basket. Its hard especially when someone complains or copies and pastes their same character. So I get what your saying, but if you want to rp you godda be a smidge flexible to some degree. \n\nI imagine good rpers are as tired of trying as you are being tried.",
