If you can't work collaboratively or share concepts, and are actually getting so angry that someone suggested telekinesis in a superpower RP (hard to see the idea as particularly precious, it's not like no one's ever done telekinesis before in a super RP) that you make an angry, spur-of-the-moment rant post, I'm going to gently suggest maybe roleplay isn't the best hobby for you right now.\n\nIf your partner is suggesting ideas, I'd see them as \"for the taking,\" not something you've stolen.
