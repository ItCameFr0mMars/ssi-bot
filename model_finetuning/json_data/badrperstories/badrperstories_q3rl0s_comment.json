            "body": "Out of curiosity, how does the tabletop rp form work in writing form? I've heard several people mention it by now and I'm so confused by how people can \"run\" or GM them? I've done written roleplay since I learned to use a computer and it has always been someone making a setting, original or a fandom, people making characters and then doing whatever. Sometimes the admins will make events, but mostly act on the same level as other players with their own characters. I can easily see a system for VtM working for text roleplay, but I'm finding it a little harder to understand how people adapt the DND system to text, considering that's mostly a tabletop game with some roleplay elements.",

            "body": "Well, you roleplay through text instead of acting it out, and the dialogue within the message may be more detailed to add personality to the character. To run a text-based RPG, the GM sets the scene at the first message of the session, and players reply to it and I reply to them based on what they had said, and so on.\n\nOne important detail is because we're used to text-based RP than the actual tabletop, which we have little to no experience with. You can do something while in session as people type, and there is no pressure in doing it right now. You can correct your response as you type. I can also start early so that people who are late can contribute later. Taking notes is easier because you can read previous messages back, and previous messages can be archived to be read later. However, the pacing is slower than actual tabletop, and having too many people massively slows down the rp, which I learned the hard way in the oneshot.\n\nOne important detail is because we're used to text-based RP than actual tabletop, which we have little to no experience with, and we are in different countries to begin with.",
