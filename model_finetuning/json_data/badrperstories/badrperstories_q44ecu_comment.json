I'm sorry you lost a friend, I just went through something kind of similar and we're doing pretty well, sounds like you are too.   \n\n\nMy sister once told me \"You can put two really good people in a room and they might not get along. That doesn't mean they're any less good. Sometimes people just don't mesh, and there's nothing for it.\" That's pretty much been my mentality with my former friend. Thankful for having known her, but I'm also thankful we parted ways when we did, so we couldn't do any more damage to each other. I still wish her the best though.   \n\n\nCheer up, OP. Better days are right around the corner! &lt;3",

There's always that weird expectation to rise above by \"getting gud\" but, sometimes we want to feel good enough as-is, without the gargantuan effort that gettin gud takes. \n\nI wind up reminding myself that RP or whatever hobby is not a job, nor should it feel like one. The expectation to self-improve becomes less imperative and more \"if you wanna.\" This is also a reason I don't join \"serious\" RP forums or servers, with activity levels or expectations. It's not a job, if I need a break, I'll damn well take it. I don't cultivate partners that will get huffy if I take a break from RP, either, if I need one. I'd rather cultivate partners with a variety of other RP partners or hobbies, so it's not like if I disappear, they'll suffer. \n\nI find myself a lot less jealous or insecure, by placing boundaries on myself. And, importantly, not accepting partners with rigid boundaries that conflict with mine. It also promotes an environment where if my partner is \"better\" than I am, I don't feel intimidated by it. If they're going to be elitist about it, bye. Otherwise, I get to enjoy good writing with a good partner.",

I genuinely think she's a good person and that all these things she did, she was doing in a misguided attempt to make things better.\n\nAlso, you mentioned in another comment that \"it's even the same universe.\" That was one of the details I changed for anonymity. We still share a lot of friends, so I don't want to start some drama where it looks like I'm publicly going after her, but I did also need to get this off my chest. I elected to do so anonymously through a throwaway account instead of poisoning the well with our remaining mutual friends. I don't want anyone to feel like they have to choose one of us over the other just because we fell out of contact or just because I made the call that I wanted her out.\n\nIf anything, I'd say your Dina is a mix of my friend's and my worst traits combined into one person. Neither of us were innocent here. I fucked up in a lot of ways while growing as a leader, I'm probably going to keep fucking up. That's just human nature. I can only be thankful to those in my server who have the patience to stick with me while I mature into the leader our story needs. \n\nBut yeah, if she sounds like Dina, it's because I misspoke somewhere. She was not nearly as manic as your girl.",
