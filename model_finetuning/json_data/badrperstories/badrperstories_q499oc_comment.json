OOC in the beginning was strictly RP or art related (but still RP related since we both drew art of our characters). We vibed really well, and now we talk daily totally unrelated to our RPs we have going. In fact, we've sent gifts to each other. I've made her a quilt, and she is mailing me stuff for my baby shower coming up. Sometimes TMI topics come up bc I'm currently pregnant and she's a mother, so it's someone who knows what I'm dealing with. Or even personal family matters. Just comes natural. But again, we've been roleplaying and talking for 3 years.\n\nThen, I've also got partners who... I guess kinda get too friendly too fast. Unless we insta-click, I need to time feel comfortable with people. Thankfully I'm not really dealing with this right now, but I wouldn't want someone I've only just started talking to and I'm not really feeling a connection outside of RP start blasting too personal information. Dumping deep shit on me whenever I'm not really comfortable...\n\nSome people I'll even roleplay with for a year + and we'll never really get a deep OOC relationship, and that's fine. I'd rather we keep things talking about RP if we don't click on a personal level. I've got a good RP partner going now where we literally only talk whenever we get a new post up and we'll talk a little bit about the RP/characters. Then silence until the next post comes around. And this works 100% for me in this case.",

Now we talk about everything (including periods, porn, and mental health), exchange Christmas parcels every year, and we even met for coffee once while I was on vacation. This happened with two other roleplay partners, so now I have three amazing friends.

These people are uncomfortably affectionate right off the bat, and they invent nicknames the first time we talk. Their focus is primarily on OOC interactions instead of the roleplay itself, and half the time it turns into a weird therapy session... they want to tell me all their problems.

Like up until I moved to Discord and started running servers myself, I was very clear with a line where I didn't let people know anything about me IRL and I was also clear that I didn't want to know about them. My reasoning was that I remembered when I was younger roleplaying and flirting a little in OOC, it was usually ERP in those days because I was a hormone-ridden teen. And then one day, without fail, my writing partner would ask to trade pictures. I was adorable, so I wasn't pressed about it, but then they'd send me a picture back and it would be someone I was not even a little attracted to and it'd just kill the story for me. So as I got older, as a preventative measure, I would limit it to zero OOC.   \n\n\nBut now, 10-20 years later, I don't really care honestly.
