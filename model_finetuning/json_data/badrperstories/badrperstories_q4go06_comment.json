            "body": "I had this happen a bit back.\n\nWe were playing four characters. Two were set because it was a previous relationship that had found one another again. The romance took off easily because we had plotted down how we wanted that to go and it did and blah blah blah.\n\nOn the other end however? We did the exact same. Plotted how we wanted the relationship to start off after a rocky moment and years of relationship tension between the characters and everything I followed through with that we plotted it was immediately rebuffed by the character moping, starting shit or doing something dumb af that killed their chances together. I even changed something around that wasn't very fitting because everything else had been so destroyed.\n\nEventually I called them out and said I didn't think we could continue. They apologized and said they didn't mean to do all of that and they just somehow forgot the plot stuff we had literally talked about before the post was made? I don't know. I said it was fine, we tried again and it was just the same thing and eventually they said they didn't have it in them to play the character anymore because so much had been messed up and wanted to start a new couple in the place of those. But I was tired after that and then things got busy due to irl things going on for them and irl things going on for me.\n\nIt was such a shame because the character was legit one of my absolute favorites aside from the other stuff. I really liked the characters vibe and story and I wished it could have actually worked out. It would have been really fun considering the plot we had laid out. And I loved all the characters we had built up and how we planned to get everyone together in one group.\n\nIt broke my little role player heart. Haha.\n\nEither way, sometimes things just don't work out and it is what it is. I would certainly discuss with your partner what's up. Especially when it comes to bullying your character. Sure, that can work, but it clearly isn't here and it's taking all of the fun out of this for you. If they are unwilling to change that behavior, it's just not going to work.\n\nCertainly it could be that they want a slow burn, but that's not going to happen either if all they do is bully your character and avoid anything else.\n\nIf they don't want to fix this or play the \"that's just how this character is\", I would dump them as a partner as it's simply not worth it.",

The personalities of the characters may require some tweaking.
