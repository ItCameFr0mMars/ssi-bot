You'd think this shouldn't need to be said at all, but I had such a slew of problems with it that I started telling people up front that this is a limit for me.\n\nThe roleplay starts. In the opening scene I am playing three characters, a pair of thugs and a woman they are harassing in an alley. His character is meant to rescue her and I am excited for a nice little 2v2 action scene.\n\nIn his post he describes his character walking menacingly up to the thugs, who are armed with knives. He glares and them and tells them to get lost. The thugs start blubbering and they run away. Ugh... not only did he control my characters straight out of the gate, but he thought his character was enough of a badass that just glaring at two armed men was enough to make them run away. Completely killed the tension in the scene and I immediately knew it was going to be a boring as fuck roleplay if I stuck with it. (I didn't.)",

Like, not having a decent reason prob isn't great, but would you have the same complaint if it was a female character falling in love with the guy?   \nAlthough if they were PUSHING for the romance whenever you weren't wanting to pursue it, then that'd be another thing. But a character just \"falling in love\" with doesn't sound like a very Mary Sue thing inherently. \n\nMaybe this guy was an awfully edgy mary-sue, but other than the three eyed thing, ehhhh, I mean the information you've given doesn't point to much 'bad'.",

At the time of conception, this didn't bother me, because the prompt was admittedly based on ERP, not on adventure and battle. \n\nAnd then he immediately started being a godmodding, metagaming murderhobo. I don't mean like he'd occasionally dictate how he'd physically manipulate someone's body or \"intuit\" something he didn't know. I mean like if you weren't the woman in his bed, or the lynian waiting on him hand and foot, he would take any thought you had that he couldn't have possibly known, and whether or not it was praise or submission to him, would decide whether or not he was going to divorce your head from your body.\n\nWhen I questioned him on this, his response was to basically throw a tantrum when I reminded him that actions had consequences, and this wasn't what I was interested in RPing, but if he kept this up, there would be an in-game answer to his actions. He declared that \"since I can't do anything without you questioning it, we need to scrap the RP or start over, I don't see another way.\"\n\nI didn't want to waste all my hard work building NPCs and setting, so we backtracked to before he got way out of line. Then he immediately launched a large scale terrorist attack on a major trade center because my character was being detained in a neighboring building, murdered a lot of people, and reached through a portal or something to yank my character back to him, all while the world was crashing down around because he was cutting buildings in half with his Bullshit Sword.\n\nAnother round of \"since I can't do anything without you questioning it, we need to scrap the RP or start over, I don't see another way\" when I asked him if he was aware of what he was doing and what the consequences would be.\n\nI responded with \"I have a better idea.\" I blocked him on both Reddit and Discord, where we were RPing, and then booted him. Eventually I scrapped all that work anyway.",
