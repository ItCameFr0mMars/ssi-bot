Yet 80% of the issues I got was because they didn't read the description. So I put files that said, \"You didn't read the description\" as the 'mod' and the actual mod hidden in hyperlinked text. It knocked that down to about 30% of comments/complaints, which helped.  \n\n\nIn the context of RP, if they list things I'm looking for without those passworded indicators, I let it slide. However in your issue, it sounds like even if she got both passwords, she wouldn't have given what was needed anyways and that's unfortunately where sometimes this system unfortunately falls short. Just like my \\~30% of comments/complaints I get that 'read' the description, but didn't follow the instructions.  \n\n\nIn both RP and modding, there's a level of required reading and people who don't do that? People really have no idea how frustrating it can be on the other end when they don't do it. Just the other day on a forum, I got a response to my ad that had a very specific setting. They had both passwords, but then said, \"I don't like the setting, so can we do &lt;insert irrelevant fandom here&gt;?\" Not only would it not work with the setting they proposed, they didn't acknowledge the part where I wrote specific situations for the fandoms I *did* accept.",

Rp should be fun if you think you need a password to find someone capable of making you feel that fun then we are just fundamentally on different levels with rp. \n\nI\u2019m sure it helps you know you have a foot in the door with dealing with responses when people send the passwords, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t make you any more likely to click with the individual in an rp setting. Having MULTIPLE passwords doesn\u2019t really change it passed being a bit overkill. Someone could read both and forget one when messaging you because of a slew of reasons. As long as you\u2019re not a jackass to people in responses who don\u2019t include any / all the passwords though then it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole no.
