Is this the same person you\u2019re roleplaying with, or different roleplays that you feel you\u2019re just giving the same responses to?\n\nPacing also helps drive those situations forward. Don\u2019t linger too much unless your partner really wants to focus on EVERY aspect of the act. \n\nYour character could also try different locations and different positions. Look up Kama Sutra and read about, try and find synonyms to describe sensations, noises, feelings, sounds, and dialogue. \n\nReading (good) erotica helps as well. It can expand your vocabulary and help give you an idea of pacing as well.",

Even if they don't even know each other's names, maybe one of them discovers the other's right nip is more sensitive, or that they're crazy for being squeezed right above the hipbones. Maybe they react with nervousness to taking off their shirt even though they're fine with pants off. Maybe one gets into the other's head by fondling a surgical scar that they have always thought was ugly about themselves. Even a sexual relationship changes over time.\n\nYou have to have a partner who gives you clues, or responds to yours, for it to work, but it can. I have an rp that's been going almost a year and has a significant component of erotica between action and SOL plot sections, and over time the characters have negotiated around to a different sexual relationship than they started with. They're still more or less top and bottom, but the power play between them shifts and is played with more as they get more comfortable and trusting  with each other. They have sex in different locations and situations. They've been injured and recovering, and that affected their sex life, too. \n\nYou don't have to tell the story outside the erotica, but acting as if there *is* a story outside the erotica can make it more potent, varied, and interesting.",

            "body": "This post was not flaired as NSFW and probably should be, but this response is NSFW.\n\nDepends on why you're writing ERP, really.\n\nDo you find repetitive sexual scenarios interesting or titillating? Does your partner?\n\nIf the answer to both of those is 'yes,' then you're fine.\n\nIf the answer to either of those is *no*, then the fundamental question is \"why are you doing it, then?\" What are you hoping to accomplish with writing this? What is the goal, here? Without knowing the goal, it's hard to give you specific advice.\n\nThat said, here's some general stuff.\n\nI don't usually write erotic RP, mostly because I find the mechanics of sex to be incredibly boring when they aren't explored beyond the surface level of physical pleasure. I know how sex works, and most of the time a good bedroom scene IRL is not going to make for very interesting writing, especially after getting it right the first time.\n\nWhen I do write erotic RP, my character is usually looking for something beyond satisfying sex on a physical level, and this informs how they operate in and outside the bedroom. \n\nI find in ERP there are a lot of people who tend to not ever engage with the negative side of sex in an attempt to be relentlessly erotic/sex-positive (and also to not insult the other player's character by implying that they are less than 100% sexually desirable, or touching on the third rail of the reality that there's a vast and complicated gray area between enthusiastic consent and nonconsent), but while I would consider myself to be highly sex-positive, this doesn't mean that sex exists in a completely uncomplicated space. \n\nIRL sex doesn't need a motive beyond getting off, but in writing, it tends to if it's going to have any longevity beyond a one shot. \n\nPresumably these characters have some sort of relationship or lack-thereof. Even if it's a one night stand, how does your character feel about meaningless/anonymous sex? Are these feelings entirely uncomplicated? If it's more long-term, do these characters always have completely uncomplicated devotion towards one another? Do they have no personal sexual hangups whatsoever? Must the sex *always* finish with mutual simultaneous orgasms? \n\nGood writing has conflict. This includes ERP. That conflict can be relatively low stakes. Maybe a character is skeptical about their potential to enjoy a certain kink and goes into the scene consenting to try it out not because they're personally aroused by it, but because they want to be GGG, and they find out they like it. Or they decide it isn't their thing, but it turns them on how much their partner is into it, and that provides its own kind of pleasure. It's a simple arc, but it is an arc.\n\nIt can be higher stakes. Maybe the two characters were in an argument and are using sex as an unhealthy way to resolve conflict, even if the sex itself is really, really good. \n\nMaybe one character has to seduce another character who is aware that this character is likely to try to use sex to manipulate them, but they succeed in seducing that character anyway. A scene like that is going to have a lot of emotional baggage for both characters to unpack, even if the sex itself is really, really good.\n\nIf the ERP is interconnected to a larger storyline, that conflict should bleed into the sex scenes, even if the sex scenes are pursued by the characters in the interest of leaving those conflicts behind for a brief moment (they do not have to be successful in achieving this simply because they would like to, but even if they are successful, such a frame will inform the tone of the scene, lending a sort of desperation to the encounter that may not otherwise be there.) Otherwise, the erotic scenes will feel a lot like disconnected scenes which could be inserted at any point in the story, and not a natural progression of the storyline.\n\nDoes the sex always have to end with orgasms (if done for titillation the answer might be yes unless it's connected to a kink, but if done for the storyline to be interesting, I'd argue the answer should be no)? Maybe one character uses lots of edging to get the other character hot and bothered, and then leaves them that way. Maybe the sex is interrupted by an interloper, and it throws off the rhythm. Maybe the outside plot comes screeching into the bedroom and there are more pressing matters at hand. Maybe the first time is awkward for one or both parties and someone finishes prematurely or can't perform under the pressure. \n\nFrankly the most interesting ERP I've written are scenes where the character is using sex as a proxy for something else, or something plot-related is accomplished through sex. I also find writing bad sex scenes to be very interesting/revealing about a character, but a lot of people won't write these for ego/titillation reasons.",

Even I can start to sound repetitive and I've got 15+ years experience in roleplaying and writing in general. \n\nYes, everyone's advice on changing positions is solid, but my advice? Talk to your partner. See if RPing an erotic scene that long (or longer) is okay and if that's their scene and if it is, have them take on a leadership role. And if they're not okay with that, well, they may not be the RP partner for you.",

            "body": "I think it's fun to incorporate a lot of dialogue. Have the characters talk about what turns them on, or what they want to do to each other, or have done. Or maybe there are times where they get nervous or self-conscious, or feel silly. You could throw bits of humor in, too. As with any other scene, it helps to break up the \"tension\" with lighter moments. \n\nI also recommend engaging the senses as much as possible. It's not just about the specifics of what characters are doing, but how it feels, the tastes, sounds, and textures involved, etc. Sometimes it's fun to make that a challenge in the roleplay, such as if one character blindfolds the other, you can write just what they'd experience without the visuals.\n\nRead some steamy romances or erotica for ideas!",

            "body": "Wow, this thread is super inciteful, I gained something from it as well. All of the comments so far have really extensive tips that will be useful. I personally liked WeWhiskers00's take the most.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I started erping in my early years... I was pretty much in the same situation as you, where my writing felt incredibly repetitive and drawn out. I have always written as a more dominant man in those scenes, so honestly I should have realized how much opportunity was given with that alone. It should also be noted that I was a virgin who only read erotica and watched porn at the time, so not knowing what actually goes on in the bedroom stunted my writing experience. \n\nI ended up taking a pretty long hiatus from writing erp just because I wasn't satisfied with how I wrote them out. In that time I discovered a few things:\n\n* Writing erp for the sake of erp made it feel like a chore. The way I got around this is by solely doing erp if it is significant for the plot or character development. \n* Characters: As I mentioned before I have always played male characters who top. However, being a top is already vague in itself. That's why I implemented very specific kinks to each of my characters depending on their personalities and the setting. This is where research would come in since it's important to recognize the layers within kinks, especially if it could be considered a safety hazard. Using these kinks can offer a wide range of reactions from my partner, which ultimately makes every scene unique, just like real life instances.\n* After getting laid, I had a more realistic approach as well. As a female sub who plays a man who tops, I sort gained the mentality of knowing what a top could do to garner a reaction.\n* Pacing: Now, this is something I'm still working on because as a slow literate/novella writer the thought of staying in an erp over a span of a week when the actual scene is over period of 30 min can make things frustrating. Honestly, I'd like more insight from other rpers for this but one thing I want to avoid is rushing through it. Then again, I don't know how much detail would be considered too much? So this is where communicating with your partner comes in. Some may prefer getting through it in a few posts, where as others are willing to stew in it much longer.\n\nThat's all I can offer but I hope you gain something from it.",

Dirty talk? Smack talk that's being batted back and forth between rivals, or loving commentary gasped and sighed by lovers? \n- Consider props, changes in position, physical limitations (or lacks thereof!); Is one character much larger or smaller than the other? Where are they, and why? How did they wind up in this situation with this person, and how do they feel about it? \n- Remember that sex is not always picture-(or story-)perfect. Sometimes it's messy, or loud, or people get cramps. Sometimes they get interrupted. Sometimes one party can't finish, or doesn't want/need to. \n\nThe list goes on and on, but basically boils down to: sex, and writing about it, is so much more than \"thrust, grunt, repeat as necessary.\" Feel free to get carried away with all the little details.",
