            "body": "\"In the post, she claimed that whenever she talked about the stuff she liked, it would just get torn down or made fun of, but in the group chat I was in, we never did that, not to the extent she claimed. Literally the most any of us ever said was \u201cCool, I feel like this thing/this famous person is a little overrated though,\u201d or \u201cI personally don\u2019t like this, the fandom doesn\u2019t really know how to act sometimes/can be really toxic,\u201d which was hardly us tearing her interests down or making fun of them.\"\n\n\\-&gt; I kind of disagree with this. True, these statements are not that harsh...but I get that it's annoying and can feel like your interests are torn down. Imagine just wanting to have a nice talk in the group chat about your interests, and the most innocent comment turns into negativity when people tell you that the actor is overrated or the fandom is toxic. It can be annoying and frustrating, especially if you just want to talk with people about your interests and not have a discussion about how toxic a specific fandom is. Especially if it happens all the time, it can feel like people are nitpicking every interest of yours and try to find something that is negative (actor is overrated, fandom is toxic, and so on).\n\nFor me, it seems like the negativity and drama came from all members of the group chat, and she is not the only one who is blowing things out of proportion. On the one hand, vague posting and her behavior definitely isn't the best...on the other hand, I don't feel like most of the things your listed are as bad as you make them out to be. \n\n\\-'the 17 is not legal, 18 is and therefore is okay' mindset is very widespread\n\n\\-okay, so this person (in your opinion) didn't snap at her... In this situation, I kind of get both sides. It can be frustrating if you just want to vent and someone tries to comfort you in a way you don't appreciate, but it's also a bit...hurtful if you tell someone nice things to comfort them and doing your best. The person who told Aubrey about their problem could have worded it differently, like 'I know you're trying your best to make me feel better by saying nice things, and I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, I still feel kind of down, I don't think anything can make me feel better right now. Maybe it would be better if we could talk about (...) instead so I can distract myself a bit?'\n\nPhrasing it like \u201cI know you\u2019re just trying to be nice and I\u2019m not trying to sound mean or anything, but you telling me all these nice things isn\u2019t really helping me feel better,\u201d sounds a bit...I don't know, accusatory? As if it's Audrey's job to make them feel better.  It's like 'I know you're trying but it's not helping.' and I think it would've been nicer if they at least acknowledged that Audrey tried to comfort them and told them what they wanted them to do instead. There is really not much 'audacity' in that, a lot of the actions on all sides seem to be in 'the heat of the moment' stuff that could be handled better after everyone calmed down. And I can't help put feel like this issue would have been handled better just by the three of them, not with people who seem to interpret a lot into into what one party (Audrey) says and isn't really involved at all. \n\nIn the end, I get the feeling that there was a lot of drama and negativity in these group chats, and it does sound that a lot of stuff turned into useless negativity and drama/debates from everyone. Like the thing with the Hollywood sex debate, it doesn't sound like Audrey was the only one seeking drama in that situation, and it sounds like there was a lot of general toxic behavior and people trying to police what other people can write/think.",

My issue with the way Audrey acted about it was more that she took any minor criticism and saw it as a major one, even when it was something like \u201cEh, I guess this thing is okay, but I feel like the fandom is toxic/isn\u2019t that great\u201d\u2014like it\u2019s one thing to want to discuss things you enjoy, but it\u2019s another to expect everyone else to never say anything even remotely negative about it.\n\nAnd true, the \u201c17 isn\u2019t legal, but 18 *is* so therefore any relationship an adult has with an 18 year old makes it legal\u201d view is pretty widespread, but my line of thought was more \u201cAn 18 year old is only barely an adult and not at all at the same mental capacity as an actual adult\u2014they really aren\u2019t any different than a 17 year old, who\u2019s only a year younger,\u201d which is what bothered me the most about Audrey\u2019s attitude towards the whole 18-year-old x adult shipping thing.

Yes, I am aware it is problematic. I'm a critically-thinking adult, and would prefer to not be patronizingly reminded for the thousandth time that obviously-bad thing is bad.\n\nNot every shipping dynamic has to be healthy. Some people want to write unhealthy ships whilst knowing and saying with their full chest that, yes, *this is unhealthy*. For some people, that's the appeal.\n\nPeople can even ship unhealthy things specifically because they think it's hot.\n\nPersonally, I have no interest in writing a ship between an 18 year old and someone much older because at my age I cannot fathom wanting to play or play against an 18 year old character, or finding them attractive. To me, they do look and act like children (but ones who can vote and drive and get carted off to war,) and...that's not my thing. I don't even want to do SFW RPs involving kids/teens/young adults.\n\nThat said, I think a lot of people who get into these conversations make this weird assumption that shipping or roleplaying something in fiction is an act of *condoning* it IRL. It's not...it's fiction. I also write characters who kill, steal, lie and manipulate, and I don't think it's okay to do any of that IRL either, but for whatever reason the moral panic police only seem to care when it's sex stuff.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR: People are allowed to ship and RP things even if they're problematic. Informing someone that something is problematic is not actually the same thing as telling someone they can't roleplay/ship it.",

            "body": "Yeah, but that is the time when you don't necessarily need to say anything. Like I get it, I don't like superhero movies, I don't like She-Ra, I don't like Sherlock, I don't like many actors. That is completely normal. I also don't like any fandoms, I feel like they all are toxic to some degree, unless it's a small fandom with only dozens of members. Still, if someone shares their interests online, and I have nothing positive to add, it's often better to just join the discussion later on, when the topic has changed. Yes, I know that not everyone shares my interest...but not everything has to prompt a discussion on how toxic a fandom, or how overrated an actor is (and be honest with yourself, if you state stuff like that someone is overrated/a fandom is toxic, you kind of prompt the other person to defend themselves).\nAnd from what you tell us about the group chat, this rather annoying (sometimes even toxic) mindset of 'Everything suddenly turns into a discussion' seems pretty widespread, which in turn makes the atmosphere a place where you can't share anything without fearing to be criticized.\n It's a thing that kind of ties in with the Hollywood sex debate...not everything has to turn into a huge discussion were people attack each other left and right  (and you said that everyone joined in except you...not only Aubrey). I can't imagine that there weren't any instances were this happened with other stuff. She seems more like a 'symptom' of a rather bad groupchat, not like the sole cause.\nTo be honest, the whole group chat sounds like a toxic place, where the mods should step in because of infighting and useless discussions where only one person gets attacked.\nDon't get me wrong, Audrey doesn't sound like the nicest person, and I would probably avoid someone like her...but it does look everyone in these group chats desperately needs to mind their own business and needs to work on how you make things not escalate.\n\nYes, but not every relationship dynamic which is explored in fiction needs to be healthy. If that is a boundary for you, that's totally fine, I would also be uncomfortable. And if Audrey would force other people to write that, I can get being grossed out. But if you don't write with her? None of your business.\nCharacters under 18 in relationships with adults are often literally forbidden (at least in the forums I'm in) which in turn makes it everybodys business.",

I'mma say mind your business lol Guess what, I KNOW things like serial killing cannibals are \"a problem\", I don't need to sit down and think... \"Wow this is actually problematic and I should reflect on that.\" Nah. I'm an adult who knows right from wrong, and I feel like writing some raunchy fiction. \n\nSame goes for if I wanna write an 18 year old character in a romance with a 35 year old. I'm mature enough to know that, hey, it's not healthy irl. But. Right now, I'm writing a fictional story for my own enjoyment and I'm not gonna really concern myself with the morals of it.",
