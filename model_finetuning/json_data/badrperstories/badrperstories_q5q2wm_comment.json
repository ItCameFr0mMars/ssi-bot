So I was mystified when I discovered I got blocked by a potential partner on Discord. We hadn't even started the RP yet, I don't think -- just in that initial chatting/brainstorming phase and she ended up bailing because she was intent on doubling and I was less so. I was gonna message her with something like, 'No worries, good luck in your search' and discovered I'd been blocked. It threw me for a loop, but after posting on here and getting a bunch of feedback about the reasons for blocking, I understood that it meant different things to different people, and isn't necessarily indicative of awful/stalkery behavior.

I also see blocking as kind of a last resort type of thing, I usually don't block unless I think 'I never want to interact with that person ever again, and they shouldn't be able to contact me in any way.' which has happened like...three times. But on a roleplaying site I'm on, many people use it so that they don't accidently contact someone with whom they haven't worked out before (name changes are possible on that site, but if you have them blocked their new name is blocked as well), so I never saw it in such a negative way.",

I\u2019m not the best at punctuation myself so I don\u2019t really require it all I ask is you at least use periods ** around actions or \u201c\u201d around what your character is saying and \u2018\u2019 for thoughts or something so I will know what\u2019s going on better. I like to be detailed so I do like it when my role partners can match my length or at least come somewhat close. I tried rook but everyone on there either wants to just trade dudes or talk dirty. And the ones who will rp either send one to two lines then after a few reply\u2019s don\u2019t reply anymore because they don\u2019t want to read my \u201cnovels\u201d as they call them. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a book worm and I do like to read and use detail. I enjoy changing the way I type and speak to fit my character more. I enjoy pretending to be others in roleplay and being so similar to that person that it\u2019s like I am that person. Of course if I don\u2019t know them then I\u2019m not going to be perfect or maybe even good but I\u2019ll tell you and can try. I don\u2019t see why people try to roleplay if they don\u2019t enjoy it. Or only want to pretend their having sex with you because your \u201chot\u201d so they can get off.
