            "body": "Okay so this may not be exactly right to the question but about two or three years ago back when I was with my ex, who we're gonna call Cali, we would roleplay all the time. Infact we met through a mutual partner we had and after talking for a while, OOC obviously, she asked me out and U obviously accepted.\n\nNow at the time I had only ever roleplayed on Quotev and it wasn't a hobby I shared at all so I wasn't that good of a roleplayer nor did I know much about everything so I sort of just listened to what people told me and took gospel as truth. \n\nNow to set the time me and Cali were both into undertale so we figured we'd do something about that. I slapped my, at the time, best character Locken \"Icy\" Lilyith up and she tossed Tsubaki at me. \n\nNow it went okaish I guess at first but it quickly became a mess. One of the charas I was playing, Ink, was her sorta brother but she liked him and he didn't vibe with that so she tried to kill herself but then I didn't let that happen and pulled a magic stunt with Icy but it had the side effect of fuckin her up. She then promptly said that it wasn't Icy who saved her but some bs soul shit and this would quickly become a reoccurring thing when a character she made me play or my Oc would do something only for Cali to go \"Hmmm, no, Tsubaki did that.\" It annoyed me but, hey, it made her happy and whatever.\n\nIt was two or three months in it took a nosedive. She made me play a character I didn't know and wasn't comfortable with, forced me to drp/erp, made me play ALL the cc's she brought in including my characters Love interest, shoved my oc to the side and made me main Tsubakis interest. It was just a mess and despite me asking her to fix some of the issues we had in chat she cited her \"poor\" memory and guilted me via use of her self harm habits and sub par home life into never actually quitting the rp. \n\nThe only thing I enjoyed about that chat was this little blob of ink and magic called \"Blobby\" that ended up accidentally being created that I obviously got the rights to. He was just adorable and the only thing soothing me at the time lol.\n\nAfter we broke up its obvious that the dumpster fire we made got dropped. Never been more glad about something like that. Looking back I didn't realize how scuffed it was for her to do all these things and only actually had an issue with playing all the characters (up to 15 in one scene, but normally about 5 at any time. 3 bare minimum) and not getting to make my Oc do cool shit like her Mary Sue got to. Thinking now her oc was an extra cringe Mary Sue too, since she had that whole has to be unique plus that cringe wattpad fanfic depression with unrealistically gorey self harm going on. Didn't see any problems with her forcing drp/erp despite me always saying I hated it and was super uncomfortable with that shit. Figured it was normal or something like an idiot.\n\nAnyway glad to finally get some of that out of my headspace. Not sure if this fills the question but it was the first thought to hit my mind outside the weird as fuck thing one group did but that feels more fetish based and yeah.",

I'll talk about the most \"recent\" one. \n\nSo I joined this group under the impression that it wouldn't have erp, that if the members wanted to do that they would take it to dms. Well only a few days passed since the rp was up and running and the owner of the group decided they wanted erp. Without asking anyone, even the mods, they changed the rules to allow for it but only in designated areas. Well they ended up doing an erp scene in a non designated area and got called out for it by a member. Instead of moving the scene they changed the rules yet again to allow those scenes to happen anywhere. \n\nThat same owner was very firm on only allowing 3 characters per person so that it didn't become crowded. Well every time a new person entered they would try and push them into a interaction with one of their characters which was already in a scene. If they declined because they didn't want to interrupt, the owner would make a new character. They seemed like they had to be involved with every scene going on and jumped in to one's that they were not invited into, which was also one of their rules. \n\nFrom what I can remember the group died out quite fast.",

I immediately told staff. They said the site had never been restricted to adult players, so they couldn't remove a player for being under 18. The problem here was not \"a minor is writing on your site\", it was \"a minor is writing smut with adults on your site\". I was new to group roleplay and to writing smut, so I thought that maybe the few posts I'd seen explaining the dangers of minors writing smut with adults were overblown. A few years down the line, being vastly more experienced in roleplay etiquette and do's and don'ts, I saw the name of the site floating around and abruptly realized something to the effect of *holy fuck what were they doing?!*",

There was bad RP of course, and of course, I was the one that had to handle removing people from the guild if they weren\u2019t up to our writing standards because no one else wanted to do it. (I didn\u2019t either, more than the others actually since I have rejection issues from my ADHD). There was this one person that the leader invited to the guild as a joke knowing full well that they were not a good RPer, so much lore breaking and bad grammar and ugh. Several players asked what was up with that and each time I brought the matter up in officer meetings, I\u2019d get told \u201cNo you have to keep them in because it\u2019s funny\u201d by the leader. \n\nThis leader would also walk around the main city trying to *lynch* people. Yes, lynch. It got to the point where his antics made us an outcast from the rest of the guilds and it was embarrassing playing on my main because everyone knew who she was. But anyway, I only found out once I had been kicked out of the guild (because I was no longer doing their dirty work after I grew a backbone) that the only reason the leader kept the bad RPer in the guild was because he enjoyed watching me get annoyed by it. The entire experience tarnished my main\u2019s reputation on the server, no one would RP with me, so I decided to just stop RPing because all the good players looked down on me for things I didn\u2019t have control over. I only stayed in the guild when things were starting to take a nosedive because my character and some others had connecting storylines and I liked talking to everyone.",

            "body": "I've had a few instances that I guess were more weird than anything.\n\n1. My first time doing fandom RP. I wasn't in a formal group but it was tumblr, so most RPers in the fandom followed each other and wrote together, so we knew was going on in each other's threads and our plots intertwined a lot. Anyway, I was roleplaying with someone who played my character's sibling, and there was family drama going on between them. Each character had their side of the story and would at times confide in others about what was happening. Neither one was entirely right or wrong, but at one point the person I was writing with decided to make an ooc post *calling out my character*, writing out everything he did wrong (from their character's point of view) so that everyone could \"understand the situation and have their characters choose who to believe.\" Basically they gave one-sided info ooc in hopes that other roleplayers would metagame, and give their characters that info ic so they would take their character's side. That was nearly ten years ago and I still can't believe someone wrote a call out post for an ic fight that was happening.\n\n2. Different fandom. I started RPing with someone who pretty quickly showed interest in shipping. Their character kept flirting and making advances on mine, they asked me ooc multiple times if I liked the ship and how I'd feel about possibly writing it, and they even encouraged me to have my character say flirty/sexual things back at theirs. It wasn't a ship I ever considered before, but I focus on chemistry and am very \"if it happens, it happens\" about ships so if the RP went that way, I'd be cool with it. It got to a point where our characters had kissed and mine was started to really feel interested in theirs... and then suddenly ooc they said they \"don't ship that ship, because it's fucking weird.\" It was suddenly as if the last few months of us writing, of them pushing for this ship, had never happened. And just like that they stopped writing that character with me and it was never mentioned again.",
