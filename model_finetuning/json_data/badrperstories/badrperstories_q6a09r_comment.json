            "body": "Don't think there have ever been ones I've grown to hate. If I disliked them enough early on, it'd be likely the roleplay wouldn't have gotten very far anyway.\n\nBut some contenders:\n\n1- Recently-ish, the character's first line of dialogue to my character was \"You smell like stinky cigarettes. I'm telling '\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'\". After that post, I called it quits with that person. But we also just weren't compatible anyway, but it didn't help that their character seemed like an actual child.\n\n2- This character I didn't hate, and he belonged to a friend of mine. Our characters were in a love triangle, and the character I wasn't super fond of was this dorky, but sweet guy. He wasn't an awful character, but he wasn't interesting and in the love triangle my character had little reason/motivation to stick with the sweet dorky guy, and instead was being swayed towards the more interesting alternative. Both my friend who controlled the character, and the character himself were in a hissy over this... Basically very \"nice guy\" vibes. /Note that, my friend was playing both love interests, she was just upset that my character chose the 'bad boy' over her boring 'nice guy'.\n\n3- Basically any character that's one dimensional. They exist to fill a role, and nothing more. They may have only one defining personality trait, or absolutely no personality at all. These seem to be like usual self inserts. Not really characters I \"hate\", but... It's very hard to stay invested with them either.",

            "body": "Context:\n\nWay back in the day, I wrote a kinda-good OC in a group RP. Like, I have a certain fondness for her, but I'm not gonna say she was the cat's pajamas or anything, particularly since this was a long time ago and I've gotten much better at creating characters.\n\nAnyway, because it always must come down to shipping, this character actually did a relatively good job of being attractive to multiple \"desirable\" characters in the RP, and while there weren't even *that* *many* actual characters she had relations with in the RP, she did get a lot of attention and spawned a lot of crackships. It was fun.\n\nAnd she did get close to a character that one of the admins wanted to ship with. So...\n\nThe admin basically...makes a character who looks very similar to mine in basic looks. Hair color, eye color, height, etc.\n\nI mean, that's fine, I don't own an appearance. Humans come in all shapes and sizes and it's not like the face claims are twins.\n\nNames the character a name that is literally the first syllable of my character's name.\n\nOooookay, maybe she just likes the name?\n\nStarts tagging the same stuff I'd shared as inspiration for my character talking about how it's *sooooo* like her character.\n\nHmmmmm...\n\nImmediately starts aggressively flirting and demanding scenes with the character my character had been getting close to and the admin OOC keeps vaguely hinting about how much she ships the two.\n\nWell, that's not subtle.\n\nEnds up playing scenes with very similar characters as my character did, and having very similar storylines.\n\nBoo.\n\nThese characters ended up being so similar in their general, over all vibe that other players who didn't know the two very well would get confused and call her character my character's name, and vice-versa. The *admin who created the character* on multiple occasions literally called her own character by my character's name, apparently on accident. Even she couldn't tell them apart.\n\nOh, and her character was *a virgin*. (This character was a woman in her mid-twenties. I wouldn't make a point of it if it was a young teenager, but at a certain age, that's a Deliberate Choice.) And she would constantly tease the male OCs she was interacting with about it. My character was sexually awkward and inexperienced, but I'd specifically avoided making her a virgin when I came up with the character to avoid the virgin fetishization that this other character walked, willingly, right into.\n\nAnyway, no one I was developing storylines with were buying it, but kinda went along with the similar storylines for the other character because it was the admin of the RP we otherwise loved and they didn't want to rock the boat.\n\nAnd then my character and the character the admin had specifically created their character to seduce (except not really, because, virgin!) ended up a bonafide ship (to the surprise of literally everyone, including myself and the other player, for...reasons) and the admin didn't like, harass me or drive me out of the RP, but definitely stirred up drama against me because even she knew it was petty to harass a player over ships.\n\nAnd I've pretty much avoided shipping like the plague in group RPs ever since.\n\nSo, yeah, I did hate the \"my character, but worse\" character. A whooooole lot.",

            "body": "There's a type I have gradually less patience for over the years I've been roleplaying. I think of her as the Needy One. It's overwhelmingly more likely to be a female character regardless of player gender.\n\nThis type of character usually is not physically ill. I'd be down for that, because I love having my characters take care of people. Instead, she's super tough and deadly, whether from being a warrior or from magical powers, but she has some kind of near-crippling mental illness or trauma or both that renders her gradually harder and harder to roleplay with over time. Imagine, if you will, a tsundere who says something mean to you and then has a mental breakdown immediately if your character reacts naturally to that. It's your job to always be okay with everything she does, because she's just suffered so much.\n\nNow, in some cases this is an rper looking for reassurance about their *own* mental illness. I get that. I've been medicated for mine for around 15 years now. And in some cases they're really well written, which is why I've stuck around for them. My biggest problem is that in real life, mental illness usually doesn't go away, you just get better at coping with it and working around it, and these players tend to adopt the longevity of the issue without adopting the gradual attainment of coping skills. \n\nIt takes an unusually good writer to both write a \"tough woman with trauma\" character and successfully have her advance over time rather than just wallow in it. I've seen it happen, my old Elder Scrolls partner was really good at it, but it's rare. So as soon as I see one of these character intros I cringe, because I'm usually not going to turn down a good writer, but you can't tell early on if you're getting a sensitive and interesting character arc or another incarnation of the Needy One.",

            "body": "I'd hinted at this character in a previous post of mine, \"Cotton Candy\", but ended up losing steam to write the post, but here we go.\n\nTo abridge the compounding issues with this OC and player, I'll make a list:\n\n(Player had a secondary OC that over-used the term \"poppet\" to refer to people in a world with no British culture or language equivalent, but honestly he was fun at least. Far superior to the first OC.)\n\n-OC had a rather stereotyped \"grown woman body, young girl mentality\" concept for their OC which was further compounded by the \"borderline psycho\" persona they went for.\n\n-Player persistently described her OC's walk as a \"waddle\" and never clarified in what way they walked beyond that; we did end up asking them if they meant to type a sashay and just didn't know the word, but it never changed. We forever collectively ended up imaging very unflattering images of this OC roaming around with a wedgie, a sore back or \"gotta poop\" gait because the player used pretty much nothing else other than \"waddle\".\n\n-Player constantly tried to be subtle with their thirsting by involving their OC in canon and non-canon chats and being \"part\" of settings they didn't need to be in/had no reason to be in/were already taken up by other players but wouldn't come out and say they wanted a ship or interaction. Instead, they fixated, especially on one particular OC, and butted into conversations others were having, DESPITE having been in a scene already. If their thirst trap showed up, they'd abandon their scene mid-chat and switch to wherever that OC was, even if they were also half way into their own interaction. Player ended up ruining both scenes by derailing them with nonsense because IC the character didn't know what was happening and OOC they didn't read back or follow along if they weren't directly involved so they didn't know anything happening and killed the buzz.\n\n-OC had a speech quirk causing them to stutter that magically vanished at times when they were being \"badass\".\n\n-Player refused to read into lore and rules and ended up open-carrying a bladed weapon in an area they were explicitly told they couldn't, so player used \"anime skirt magic\" to hide an entire battle axe on their person in public. We already bent over backwards to allow them to own the weapon in a place where those things are technically illegal and heavily monitored, but it was a \"comfort prop\" due to backstory reasons that was so important to the OC they couldn't be without it at any point. Despite this and the warnings about \"barbarian weapons in a civilized city\" (world building), player proceeds to directly threaten an NPC with said weapon because they were being just a bit less than ideal; NPC ran in fear, and the follow up was going to be a police call due to threats of violence but it never got that far.\n\n-Player attempted a backstory where an abusive relative died of an OD to a drug that was just reskinned weed, which is explained in the post about drugs in this world but again, they didn't read anything.\n\n-Player scoffed at the idea of a lore and story heavy RP group requesting read-alongs before joining certain chats to ensure the tone, context and setting weren't compromised.\n\n-Various OOC situations of a known 13-year-old not knowing how to interact in a group where everyone was 17+ so age gap and experience gap became an issue.\n\n-Another player tells us in private that the younger one had a habit of trying to RP smut before they'd joined this group, with people they knew were older, so the already shakey ERP rules got locked down fairly hard. No one really did ERP in the server, it was mostly off-site stuff, but we couldn't keep a child in ERP servers because duh. Nevermind the fact the brief window this younger player was in our 18+ chat due to us not knowing their age at the time, they had a vastly incorrect concept for male anatomy that tipped us off they were both too young for NSFW content and too immature to get a pass to draw dicks in the chat.\n\n-Player would take criticism about as well as one would assume, becoming visibly down and \"put off\" whenever any attempt to correct or constructively critique their RP style (it clashed with the group a bit), their RP etiquette, or the world rules, so at some point we just stopped because they weren't receptive and nothing changed.\n\nSo yeah, both player and OC had issues, which is a shame because we really tried to accommodate despite them despite the glaring hiccups it presented, and the player had a firm grasp of character creation and storytelling, they just... didn't have the experience to match the group in terms of actual execution and performance. If the thirsting (near OC stalking) and etiquette issues didn't exist, it wouldn't have been such a problem but it ultimately boiled down to they lacked maturity and experience for our age range and that can't be helped really.\n\nThough it's of note they ended up in the group via an invitation from a different problem player but they only got that invite because they harassed that player until it was given, so when we found that out it explained a lot about the type of person they were and that they were like that from the beginning, we just didn't notice until much later.",

His main wasn't bad either, a sort of sensitive reporter type in a dystopian sf setting that was a bit like a District 9 concept but with humanoid birdlike aliens (a female one of whom I was playing). \n\nThe problem was that over the course of the rp, he introduced an npc that it quickly became brutally obvious he would rather have played than his main. And this npc was unbearable. Not because she was a trans woman, I play with LGBT characters no problem, but because she was the most obnoxious caricature of a \"sassy girl.\" She constantly mouthed off in scenes that were deadly serious otherwise, to the point where I wanted to both strangle her in character and the player out of character. Eventually he kind of ghosted, perhaps not coincidentally when it became clear I would rather stab myself in the eye with a fork than set his favorite up with her own love interest, and I ended it after many days of inactivity on his part.\n\nTo this day I twitch when someone who isn't trans offers to play as a trans person.",

The wedding scene went off without a hitch.  \n\n\nPlayer wants a wedding night scene. I'm imagining more of what we've already done: the two friends getting a bit drunk and laughing about how they put one over on the whole family to get what they wanted. Instead, the OC is crying in the bathroom about how my character doesn't love her. It was a complete 180 from best friends having a laugh to her character having been 'deeply in love' with mine the whole time. If he would only sleep with her, he would change and be in love with her, too. When I talked to her about it ooc she laughed it off, but it became clear this was the plan all along and I was meant to change my character. It was a group RP, too, and dragged about eight players into the drama, when all my guy wanted was a best friend who was dating his brother, to cover for him and his IC long-term boyfriend. It turned out that she just really had a thing for the faceclaim and thought since I was an easygoing player I'd go along with it.",

The owner of the server wanted me to help make sure every character had something to do and one was left out, so _I tried._\n\nUrban fantasy roleplay. The player had a human girl, and she needed to interact with the supernatural creatures one way or the other. Except she had no drive, goal, or ambition. No tangible backstory other than generic \u201cshe is a shy and subby unpopular girl uwu\u201d. She just sorta existed. We talked to the player and helped them come with an excuse (her father was secretly allied with vampires, so she had to attend on of their parties). That way she could have a role, albeit minor, when shit started happening. \n\nAnd even then\u2026 she did nothing. She barely reacted in a way that wasn\u2019t whining. I sent one of my character to talk with her\u2026 and nothing. She just whined and stood still. This was before she knew he was a vampire, mind you; she was too \u201c\u201dsubmissive\u201d\u201d to actually talk to him or _anyone_. My characters offers her protection? No reaction. There is fucking murder in the dancing room? No reaction. She wasn\u2019t even trying to hide, and she didn\u2019t act scared beyond \u201cgetting nervous\u201d when someone approached her. She didn\u2019t even have a basic motivation like \u201cwoah, vampires are kinda scary, maybe I should leave????\u201d. She took her father\u2019s alliances with the dark side surprisingly well, too; it was like telling her daddy would not buy MCDonald.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to give her something to react to, she barely moved for the whole duration of the RP and eventually quietly disappeared. No development, nothing at all. It was like playing with one of those dolls that cry when you remove their pacifier or press a button. \n\nThe owner told me they were hoping for romance, but I\u2019m not sure how someone could fall for her given you couldn\u2019t even get a coherent conversation out of her\u2026 I don\u2019t understand how playing this character could be fun.",

OC wasn't bad either, but there was one thing that became frustrating: the writer couldn't decide what kind of character she was meant to be.\n\nMy character? The villain, in his 50s. Their character? 18-19 year old daughter of one of the protagonists. And she constantly flip-flopped between being a brave, badass young woman, a child, and the damsel in distress. She would stand up to the villain, try to defy him, but when it got her into the trouble, suddenly she's pleading for mercy because \"I'm a woman, and you'd never kill a *girl*, would you?\" She would attack and kill the villain's henchmen, but when one of them successfully wounds her, she begs the villain not to let her die because she's so young, she's just a kid, she's too young to die! She hasn't lived yet! She'll sneak into the villain's headquarters all on her own, slaughter dozens of enemies but when she's caught and held captive, she's now the helpless child of the hero and the plot shifts to focus on how horribly she's being treated.\n\nShe was always using the fact that she was either a kid, a girl, or both, to try getting sympathy from the villain to get out of trouble. And then it tread further into uncomfortable territory when she, on two occasions, tried to kiss him. We never discussed any sort of enemies-to-lovers plot, the villain never showed interested in her, and she never previously showed interest in him. She was always trying to kill him. He was over twice her age and viewed her as a kid, and she literally referred to herself as a kid whenever it suited her, so it all felt gross and weird. It felt like the writer wanted the best of both worlds, using their OC's age to play either a \"kid\" or a \"grown woman\" depending on what gave the OC the best outcome in any given situation.\n\nSo it's that kind of flip-flopping in OCs (and characters in general) that I hate. Thankfully we eventually started doing alternate scenarios where my character wasn't a villain and that worked out much nicer.",

They whip out their bag of powers and solve any conflict in the time it takes to microwave instant ramen.\n\n2.

            "body": "Initially I didn't hate this character. So I roleplay on a slew of sites because my addiction of choice is RP instead of drugs XD. On a site more geared towards chat Rp and fast replies I found someone that was around my skill level writing wise and had a character they'd had for a decade irl. OBVIOUSLY, with a character that old it's pretty well fleshed out with a history both from the writer's mind as well as drawing from past roleplays with the character.   \n\n\nThe character was meant to be powerful. The writer was a generally good writer, and because they didn't godmod I didn't mind their character being powerful.  The issue of this story comes from the source of said power. See, the character was a god that would one day rise to be the god of all gods for a dimension in the setting of the RP. A precursor for this was that he had three different selves inside of him. They were all one but only one could be at the surface and playing at anyone time unless a long process and preparation to temporarily separate them was made. The premise of these three selves was supposed to be \"black\" \"white\" and \"gray\". One was purely good the other purely evil and the main one who was in control most of the time was the gray zone middle man.  \n\n\nSo occasionally I'd work with scenes with the other \"selves\" but even when the \"evil\" one, who was played more like a bratty hedonist than some evil mastermind, came out he was influenced to favor my OC. Which was the whole reason she was even allowed to live and not be subjected to torture or anything in his presence. The RP and my personal liking for their oc started to decline when we went from focusing on a mix of high fantasy, adventure, slice of life to almost horror esque in some of our themes. Now lemme preface this with: I LOVE horror RP. I don't have an issue with dark themes when done properly, and I won't even say he was doing things I'd consider improper.   \n\n\nThe issue was that wasn't what this RP was for. And I was the one leading this RP mind you. Every plot was mine with the exclusion of some additions from him. He (the writer) claimed after DMing two DND games a week he didn't have many creative juices for a 1x1 RP. Which I didn't always love as sometimes I like to not know what's going to happen next, but I understood as well. The issue was the only thing he seemed to try for was making the \"evil\" literally fuck shit up.   \n\n\nI'm not even talking about stuff like, picking fights, or triggering a war. I mean nightmare realms of torturing and mentally scarring family members that we've spent over an irl year with by this point forming bonds with. Completely trying to guide the story in a permanently dark direction and mentally damaging the cast I was fleshing out more and more for his enjoyment as I essentially controlled every NPC in this world for them.   \n\n\nHonestly, I never really got an explanation for this shift. Idk if it was them trying to guide the story and just not thinking about the consequences, or if they were in a dark place irl and it bled into the RP, or something else. But at the end of the day, he essentially switched which of his characters was the one in primary control all the time. He didn't play his character wrong or inaccurately from what I know. But that shift and the way things basically went from a mix of the three selves balancing to only the \"evil\" one being present ever really ruined the RP. If it had been a horror RP from the beginning or something discussed and planned out a bit so it was handled better I think I would've still liked the character. But because the paradigm shift caused such a big chain reaction in the RP and completely tore down so much work I ended up resenting the character. I didn't realize that for a while either, the writer and I had a falling out OOC so the RP was dropped when we left each others' RP circles. We did try to reconnect after some months and mend the relationship both OOC and IC but I just couldn't get passed it. I truly didn't enjoy RPing with a character I'd adored before. The bad taste left in my mouth made it so bad I even retired the OC's I used primarily in that RP because playing as them would always remind me of how I felt and I didn't want that cloud on the back of my mind whenever I RPed.",

I have only enough energy to write about two of em:\n\n**1. That Tell-But-Never-Show character.**\nIn other words, this person would explain to me their OC\u2019s personality, traits and quirks in lengthy descriptive paragraphs irp. But they are most often simply just that, description for *my* understanding and not my *character\u2019s*. \n\nAll them long-ass paragraphs.\n\nLook, I like novella, but I like *effective* novella. I want to be able to use the info you gave me. In this dude\u2019s case, I couldn\u2019t. If I were to discard all of those paragraphs, their character was essentially being a silent emo dude with very little reaction for me to play off of. And my girl was supposed to sense all this danger coming off from the guy, that his aura is supposed to tell her that this dude has been through multiple wars (mind you, that character\u2019s appearance is a pretty boy without scars and such), and therefore should be automatically fearful of him. \n\nI mean\u2014 \u10da(\u0ca0_\u0ca0 \u10da)\n\n**2. The unrealistically one-trait character**\nThis OC is made to be a happy-go-lucky one. Sure, that\u2019s fine. Now, our discord group was holding an rp event, an adventure of discovery into an unexplored area of our irp world. That particular part of the map was supposed to be *scary*, and it was. The mods did a great job at setting up the atmosphere and all.\n\nHowever, this happy-go-lucky half-elven woman was happy from the start til the end. The player also decided to use that to her advantage, and had her elven character breeze through the challenges the mods threw on all of our OCs because her character was afraid of nothing.\n\nPerhaps this doesn\u2019t sound all that bad, but in-play, we were all annoyed that this player was gunning for her character to be that really unique one with anime-level plot armour.

(I would entertain a PLATONIC plot with a minor character having an ***unrequited*** crush on my older character with a trusted RP partner, but I did not know this person.) When I made it clear the ship was going nowhere, she bumped her up to 18 and tried again. I ended up leaving the group because she was the only person I was interacting with, anyway, and she tried to slide into my DMs to continue our \"plot.\" Yikes!  \n\n* A character who fit the Mary Sue bill in multiple ways tried to ship with one of my OCs. She came on hard and fast and was clearly unhinged, so he didn't exactly return the feelings. Over time she started to stalk and threaten him. At some point she revealed the character was a self-insert, which is why I now have my no self-inserts rule. I was so uncomfortable.  \n\n* A character who went *way* overboard on the competent, mean woman thing. She just went around lording over every other character, until there was no reason the others forced to share a tight space with her wouldn't have booted her out to fend for herself. The player makes amazing characters, otherwise; this one was just insufferable. I never wanted to subject any of my characters to her abuse, and that's saying something. I just couldn't justify them not trying to kill her or at least completely shutting down and avoiding her at a certain point!  \n\n* One who did not fit the setting whatsoever, and existed solely to fulfill the player's need for a hurt/comfort type situation. I want people to write the characters they want to write, but for the sake of the group, they need to read the room. This character was just stuck up the \"comforting\" character's ass. This was not my character, but one he interacted with often. The player of this character would vehemently ignore my character's existence, which was very awkward when it was the three of us interacting together. The only acknowledgement I can remember was for him to shit talk my character when he wasn't around. I was surprised to see the character realized mine existed!",
