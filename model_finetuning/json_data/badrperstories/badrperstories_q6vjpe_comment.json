You never know what's going on with someone's life. \n\nI think it's rude to say \"you shouldn't be roleplaying atm\", because someone might have something tough going on. Or dealing with life. Maybe they shouldn't roleplay with *you*, or someone who wants clock work replies. Perhaps they should just find someone more flexible with time.\n\nBut. I'm speaking as someone who probably relates too much to the person at the other end of your dilemma. I deal with chronic fatigue, and at current pregnancy that has made my reply speed SWOOP the fuck down. But, I still love roleplaying. I don't want to stop my roleplays because more days than not, I don't have the energy to write. I'm just grateful to have partners who are very patient and are understanding that I can't give daily replies.",

I've dealt with my fair share of dilemmas too from the stressful situation of a relative dying and constant hospital visits for six years on end. However, I get the feeling I'm entirely different from how you'd react to it. I'm just the type of person where I would *never* think about bringing that sort of thing up to someone I just met nonetheless anyone around me. It just makes me very uncomfortable to talk about it. Maybe it's for that reason I'm more cynical about it? It just rubs me off the wrong way when someone decides to bring something like that up out of nowhere.",
