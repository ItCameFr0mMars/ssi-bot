Maybe less emotional, just that you don't feel like the roleplay has the same quality anymore, you have lost the motivation to continue, and you don't feel like driving the whole plot anymore. Be blunt and clearly tell her that it's over. If she reacts badly, well, it's not your fault. You don't have to argue with her. If she doesn't stop contacting you over it, then block her. \n\nIt has been YEARS. Right know, you let your nostalgia for a roleplay that existed years ago govern your behavior.
