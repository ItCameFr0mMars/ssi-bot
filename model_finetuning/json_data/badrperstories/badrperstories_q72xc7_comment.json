Or they really thought that they might be back someday, but after a while they realized that wasn't possible. But now, they felt guilt that they made you wait and didn't have the guts to tell you that all that waiting was for nothing, and they wouldn't come back.\n\nMaybe they were facing a similiar issue with multiple roleplays on their discord because of their IRL issues, or maybe they didn't have many other roleplays on discord and just gave friends their other contacts, so they decided that by deleting their account, they  can avoid confrontation and permanently get out of this difficult situation. Maybe after deleting it, they created a new discord account.\n\nI would stop trying to contact them. I mean, look at all the stories in this subreddit that have a similiar premise (everything is going well, someone says 'hey sorry I'm busy', the other people promise to wait, the person deletes the server/their whole profile/blocks the other people involved). I think this is just a ghost story, and there isn't much of an explanation besides that.",

Especially on the block/unfriending part, but overall I've been in a slightly similar situation.  \n\n\nThe person I was RPing with just up and deleted their account on discord and their character's account on Twitter. Which, for them, was done in haste since there was some very IRL situations going on around them. I'd already knew before hand and someone who was still in contact with their IRL stuff passed along the message of what was going on. That was fine until two things happened.  \n\n\nThe first was that people were upset that the RP associated with their account was gone. While it's fine to be upset over things getting lost, it only was a problem when they left. I've made a habit of backing things up on my end so I don't lose RPs. Especially when people are known for disappearing completely from the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second was that people were trying to find them elsewhere online because some of the former were just that upset.  \n\n\nEventually they did come back to only leave again and I honestly think it's because of how people reacted, plus all the drama bombs going behind the scenes that was basically killing an already dead community at this point.
