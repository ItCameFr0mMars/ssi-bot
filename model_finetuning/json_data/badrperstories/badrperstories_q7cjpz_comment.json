JUST HOURS. People complaining about someone not being available for hours at a time is absolutely BAFFLING to me.\n\nI'm not sure if it's an age disconnect, because maybe people over here (on reddit) are younger than what I'm used to... But it seriously blows my mind that people expect prompt replies roleplay wise, or OOC wise, and think that green orb of online = YOU MUST GIVE ME ATTENTION!\n\nMan. People have other hobbies. Jobs. Families. Lives. Illnesses. I don't get how it's such a prevalent thing that people feel so entitled to other people's time.",

Getting yelled at by morons just because you have to wear a mask at your job. A lot of people lost their jobs, they don't know how they're going to pay rent, or feed their families, and someone has the gall to get shitty about response times like their time is worth more than the other person's mental wellbeing? Gets me all riled up, man.\n\nThe serotonin boost I get from seeing my partner respond is addictive, it totally is! I get it! But honestly, is it ever worth getting snippy with someone because they're not replying as fast as you want? (Spoiler: it isn't) Because I used to be like that, and I fully admit I was a shithead. I was an ass to the person I was RPing with at the time and I feel bad about that to this day.\n\nYou're 100% spot on - no one is owed anyone's time, and people need to remember life happens, pandemic is still around, and patience is a really good thing to work on right now.",

This I think is made worse when someone is excited to write, because then the rp is taking up *all* the thought space and time streeeetches oooout until the replies, especially if they have nothing else to do until then.\n\nOccasionally the OP has actually requested a daily or more frequent replier, but even then, stuff will happen and it won't be \"made up\" (seriously). My personal dislike, like you, is seeing the posts about people being online on discord and doing anything besides rping. *Oh, the betrayal!* Look, if someone is online and not replying, take a hint. They want to do something else for a while, nbd.\n\nIf this doesn't jive with you then it's basically this simple -\n\nPassive aggression, guilt tripping, pity parties \ud83d\udc4e   \nLowered expectations, pausing, or ending the rp \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTo counter my own post though, those *are* vent posts first and foremost, so, you can be aware of all of the above and still feel frustrated by it, so \ud83e\udd37",

No regrets about being banned in hindsight, but that instance did make me take a break from non-one on one rps for a year and a half until I felt comfortable establishing healthy boundaries. Because while I always believed real life &gt; RP, it took me a while to feel comfortable saying No, and sticking to it, and not going into a guilt spiral when I don\u2019t respond instantly. No one should be made to feel guilty about being busy.",
