I don't like it when it's like...Random. he wanted two woman paired with him, I figured \"Okay..like a poly ship.\" But no... The story went away from the plot and went with an 18 year old girl he met randomly becoming pregnant and wanted the other girl to fight with her and call each other names. The original plot was suppose to be for the diamond and pearl story line but he made it much more sexual that I had expected it to go. It was less story focused and more nsfw. \n\nThough the rp didn't last cause he got mad at me for not sending a paragraph to his \"My eyes kept lingering to her bust\" take that and stretch it out to paragraph and four more replies long XD",

But, nothing else is coming to mind atm.\n\nSo, the plot was supposed to be a woman in an abusive relationship ends up finding solace with her drug dealer and starts an affair with him (seeking out *him* rather than the drugs she was originally trying to seek out to begin with). I've done this plot before, and I've rather enjoyed the different dynamics that spun about. But, this isn't about *that* plot. That was meant to be the skeleton of the plot, and was not what happened. \n\nOriginally, my character was already supposed to be an addict, and she seeks out this drug dealer. BUT, the guy I was trying to start this roleplay with was like \"No no, it should be her first time using before she meets my character\". I'm like... Okayyy, that makes less sense that she would seek out a dealer but... Alright, I'll try and make it work. So, my girl is NOT an addict. She's in an abusive relationship, and somehow runs into this drug dealer... Who, I guess is just offering her drugs on the fly. For some reason, my character is just supposed to jump straight into it... And then, her motivation for returning to the drug dealer? Well, she just gets hooked right away.\n\nI'm trying my best to work with this guys logic and reasoning in getting these characters to meet, and for her to have a reason to return to his character/the drug dealer... Well, as soon as she DOES return to him, it turns into, \"Oh you want more drugs? Then you gotta have sex with me\"\n\nUuuuugh. Nope. That didn't work out.",

            "body": "Doing a steampunk rp I was a rag a muffin girl pretending to be a guy to work on an airship and get to a new land. \n\nThey were playing a dr with a kid. \n\nThe plot was that he'd find out her secret and they'd bond over keeping it during the trip. \n\nLittle side note: irl dude was a nudist with his family, no big, wanted to implement that into the rp. Fine? \n\nTurned out my character, who'd been pretending to be a guy for quite a while was essentially supposed to bond with the little girl and the dr would follow suit. The little girl kept trying to touch my character's chest, which she was uncomfortable with because she'd had a hard time hiding them, so they'd been nothing but annoying to her and some little kid trying to make her mommy made her uncomfortable. \n\nHad her express this to the dr, he waved off her struggles and encouraged the \"bonding\". My character had a break down. \n\nHe asked for a new rp, his characters: the exact same. Asked that my character was ok with nudity \"this time.\" Tried again, because fair I guess, but honestly the hyper close dad/daughter (they were really really really close) kinda weirded me out so I jumped ship. \n\nMaybe it is my own issues with nudity. Maybe it's because too make sure I wasn't a predator he sent me a VERY SO cropped pic of his baby/toddler sister and waited for me to warn him to be careful. Maybe it was because I didn't like the idea of my character being nothing but a step in mother to make his oc like her.\n\nEdit: words",

            "body": "tw for discussions of fictional sexual assault.\n\nthis was a great many years ago. I met a partner somewhere, could have been instagram or some now-defunct app called geeking. I was a teenager, a girl, and I only played male characters. always felt super weird about playing woman and just refused to do it for some reason.\n\nthe first red flag was that their character was some stereotypical sweet subby boy with no real personality. mine was a charismatic, sort of comically villainous demon.\n\nI find smut roleplay with no plot exceedingly boring, and even though I was only a teenager at the time, I was already not vibing with where things were going. in order for the characters to have any interaction at all, my demon brought this human home with him. \n\nthey make it to the bedroom. it seems like we\u2019re heading for smut. their boy has not exhibited a single intention or desire towards anything at all. just a blank canvas that looks cute. at a loss for what to do, I have my demon initiate something sexual. maybe this will be a romance, who knows.\n\ntheir replies swing wildly between describing things in a sexual context and then having her character refuse consent, verbally. I am stumped. I ask her ooc if she wants this to be a sex scene. she says yes, and tells me to continue.\n\nI\u2019m weirded out, but I have my demon continue. again, her character says he doesn\u2019t want it, tries to get away, and starts crying. I was like \u201cokay, so, this is not fun or hot at all.\u201d she wanted my character to rape hers. idk where tf this was supposed to go, but I cannot see any sort of fun and interesting relationship developing from a rape scene. it\u2019s also not in my demon\u2019s nature.\n\ndespite being hugely uncomfortable, I let things continue. I have no spine and her writing isn\u2019t that bad, so I don\u2019t want to say no. at this point I\u2019m thinking \u201cI\u2019m just going to have to change my character\u2019s personality and grind through this, maybe it will go somewhere cool.\u201d \n\nit doesn\u2019t go somewhere cool. it\u2019s just a rape scene. my replies get shorter and more sporadic. I\u2019m not vibing. we get to the point of, presumably, some form of penetration. when, out of nowhere, she says to me ooc, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to change it and have my boy be a trans boy.\u201d\n\nfirst of all, you\u2019ve already described his dick in the roleplay, so that\u2019s just retconning canon midway through. second\u2026 I feel deeply, almost panic-inducingly stressed about that.\n\nI don\u2019t reply. I try to figure it out. it\u2019s not my character, I can\u2019t decide for her what she wants to do with him. but this idea makes me nauseous. I don\u2019t have anything against trans people, do I? I don\u2019t think I do! there\u2019s just *something* that upsets me about a non consensual sex scene involving a trans character. \n\nit\u2019s almost like it\u2019s personally relatable to me and my own weird feelings about my anatomy. it\u2019s almost like this taps into something inherent to me as a person.\n\nfeeling like I\u2019m in a trance, I write, for the first time in my young life, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but as a trans boy the idea of that in the context of this scene makes me incredibly uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember what happened after that. I think she accepted it and we moved on, but I don\u2019t think the roleplay continued much further, thank god.\n\nit was a couple months still before I actually came out outside of online interactions, but that night typing to a stranger on my phone in the childhood bedroom of my dad\u2019s house was the first time I ever admitted that to anyone. \n\nthat was nearly a decade ago. I now refuse to write scenes that make me uncomfortable right out the gate, and I\u2019d never write with someone that tries to do a hugely triggering scene like that without discussing it first. whatever the case, it\u2019s a super weird way to realise you\u2019re actually a man.\n\nedit: screw it, this is so long it\u2019s getting its own post.",
