No friends, not a good job to attend, possibly fired or unemployed? \n\nYou were their only friend who cheered them up in bad times, in order to avoid... Doxxing themselves. \nYou treated them like a real life friend would! You shared your majestic art of your oc, meanwhile they didn't bother to send... Any. \n\nYou were an actual therapy to them... Instead of a friend. You've listened to the problems one by one... And this is what they returned to you? This is what you deserved? Because you asked them how they are? \n\nThey were very angry that day, weren't they? They bursted at you like a beast, as they forgot everything you've done to them... For their happiness. \n\nThat was very uncalled for. I sense someone that is very ungrateful, probably you understood why they aren't a friend keeper or never had a relationship in the first place... No one wants a person who is an ungrateful brat who forgets and blame them over nothing they done, but to bring happiness to them. \n\nYou might be shocked by their sudden behavior, it's ok.. You could take it as an experience. \n\nNever side with negative people and go the positive ones instead, no one wants a negative impact in their lives, would they? \n\n(I don't know what did I just wrote, but...
