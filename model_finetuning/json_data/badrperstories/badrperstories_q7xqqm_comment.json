They didn't do all the research into the various tropes and themes that I put together through worldbuilding to form prompts out of, so they ended up butchering it and stole the plot of RE7 to try to fill in the missing gaps (which didn't work).\n\nNot only was it demoralizing, but it really made me feel like I was a content farm. So for the last five months, I found it hard to jump into anything with strangers. I've a core group where I'm still exploring this plot, but I'm working on trying to get back to that place where it's 'open' again. Especially the 1x1 bits.\n\nIt's really best to just ask to make sure if the concept feels like it was well thought out and original. Otherwise, general prompts are general.",

But, if it's very specific I would either A) Try and politely ask if you can recycle the prompt, or B) Try and twist it up that it's your own. \n\nIf it's super specifically something this person thought up, and put a lot of effort into and it's uniquely enough theirs... I would most definitely ask.\n\n\"Would it be alright if I used a prompt similar to yours in my own search?\"  \nOr  \n\"Would you be okay if I made a prompt inspired by yours for my own search?\"\n\nSomething like that.
