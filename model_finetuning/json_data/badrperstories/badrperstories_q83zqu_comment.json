Regardless if there's a romantic side plot or not, we need to be very careful about how we interact OOC with those much younger than us. I wouldn't take it too personally, it's for both the partners' safety (a vast majority of the time). I understand the frustration, but you're just going to have to wait it out until you're in a bracket older people are comfortable interacting with.",

It\u2019s just one of those things that you have to accept. I would suggest looking into some discord roleplay servers. As long as you\u2019re mature, most of them that aren\u2019t 18+ would gladly accept you, and I\u2019ve met some really talented writers and storytellers on various servers. Take a gander at the literate tag on Disboard, and see if anything peaks your interest. You\u2019re probably gonna get a mix of people around your age and some older, so it\u2019s nice sample size of people.",

Usually we hit off really well, I've never come into an issue regarding our age difference. \n\nI personally wouldn't feel comfortable playing with someone below 18, considering the themes of my roleplays, but its not like I've ever felt as if I couldn't easily connect with the people who are twice my age through writing.",

I\u2019m sure there are teenagers out there that can be mature but when roleplaying is a hobby you just simply don\u2019t have time to sit there a weed them all out for the \u201c good ones \u201c. Sorry :/ plus the fact that many minors will say they are fine with just story and then try to weasel their way into romance and smut it just kinda a moment of people ruining it for everyone else in that case. But majorly speaking. It\u2019s the fact that by the time you are 20 the thought of rping with minors is just, not great. \n\nThink of it this way. Say you are going to a party and the next door neighbors are your only option. Now who would you realistically take? You\u2019re fellow 17 year old who is the neighbor\u2019s oldest? Or their 12 year old younger sibling. \n\nSame logic applies.",

I think I was *mostly* roleplaying with other teenagers, and we often didn't even disclose our ages until things got started and rolling. And even then, it was just because we'd be like referencing how we were in school or whatever. \n\nIt was a lawless land. lol Thankfully for both parties involved, most of my partners were also teenagers at this point in time. This also had to do with the fact that the site I roleplayed with had a lot of people in the same age range...
