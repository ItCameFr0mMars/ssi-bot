Collect what you need or want and be ready for some backlash because at this point it's inevitable, then make a formal announcement that soon (not now) you will be retiring from the server and are looking for a replacement. See if anyone come forward that you can trust, and leave an open notice that, if you and they want, anyone with connections to your OCs can either continue off the server OR come to a conclusion about what happens with the pair because things have not been progressing. State your peace, and that in (timeframe) any unappealed ships, stories, etc, will be considered concluded as you leave and anyone deemed to be harassing or negatively afflicting the departure will be automatically denied continuation and you will conclude the relevant story on your own time in your own canon away from the group.\n\nIt's concise, gives a mild dead line, options for asses to move and a clear cut off for anyone trying to guilt and complain. They didn't care enough to pick up while you were there, what does it matter if you then leave? Why do they suddenly care about a story left in the dust when you being there means jack all for the plot that hasn't been active? They have their chance and warning to reconcile, or get closure, and you have no further obligation to it because when it starts to drain your mental health then it's not worth the energy to maintain.\n\nDo it for you and screw the silence, because if you stayed and never replied to the RP anyway then it would probably stay dead going forward.",

The image must also have their username handwritten on a piece of paper in the same image. That is harder to falsify via image editing if both are present.\nAll someone should care about is the DoB.  I do not care about people's IRL gender or identity. The purpose of this is to prevent minors from getting in and doing ERP with adults.\nThe admin is to instruct them to delete the image afterward. Deleting it afterward is mandatory.\n\nIt is a completely voluntary process and people give me flak for it. If they don't feel comfortable with it, then they aren't allowed through the role-gate, since discord doesn't have any form of verification yet. It's the best I can legally do.\nThis method is a bit uncommon. Several servers have their own process that varies. There are alot of servers out there that don't and I've heard reports of minors lying elsewhere. It caused alot of issues and mistrust, doing irreparable damage to those communities and traumatizing adult players.\n\nI'd rather keep the protocol than risk a minor getting in. I'm not forcing new users to share anything. They can leave if they don't like it. There is literally over 10,000 other RP servers out there.",
