Communication between players is something I consider crucial in producing good roleplays, and if there is something you are not happy with, you *must* communicate this to your partner(s). \n\nPersonally, I would dm the other player privately and resolve the issues that you have. If multiple people are also affected negatively by that player, then either collectively discuss with that person as a group or bring it to the server mods and let them mediate.",

Since this isn't over time (the nature of it being in-game RP is that you only dedicate a few hours at a time for that situation), I thought maybe I should just suck it up or avoid this kind of event in the future (or even that person specifically :| ). \n\nIf this happens again, I'll ask the FC leader if that's normal and how I feel like it really limits any interaction I can have. They did arrive but it was as I was leaving since I'd already gotten frustrated and didn't want it to mar my interactions so I'm not sure if they took care of the problem or not.\n\nI'm still a bit down about it but I have another pop up tomorrow so hopefully it goes better.\n\nThank you for the advice.",
