            "body": "The fact that this has happened to me countless times is why that thread about the opposite situation annoyed me so much.  *Plenty* of people specifically mention wanting relaxed schedules in their ads. They aren't hard to seek out. You really have to go out of your way to find someone who is asking for frequent replies if you write multi-para/novella style.\n\nAlso, this is the sort of incompatibility that's going to be obvious within the first few days of a roleplay.  Yeah it's disappointing for an RP to fizzle but when you've only written two or three responses it's not that big of a deal; that's just what it takes to find a partner sometimes. Usually I'll wait about a week to see if things pick up, and after that I ask if this reply schedule is normal for them. If it is, I'll politely point out that I was looking for frequent replies, and I'll end it.\n\nOn the flip side - someone's harassing you for replies? \"Sorry, I wanted a relaxed schedule. It looks like we are not compatible.\" That's all you gotta say.",
