But she also always wanted to write longer/medium posts (about 500 words) and couldn't keep it short. She mostly just wrote dialogue and very short descriptions of the setting sometimes. She also knew that is was bad behavior to control my characters. So she mostly let her character's interact with each other lol\n\nIt was a constant stream of interactions like 'My character talks to her character about what she thinks about the plan. Her character answers him in two sentences, just to leave him alone, walk out of the room, and have deep conversation with a different character of hers.'\n\nAfter like, twelve replies, her characters had had at least three meaningful conversations with each other, while my character's and her character's interactions only lasted three sentences at best.",

And after that, the conversation would be over, without a reply by my character, because instead she would have her characters talk about a different topic (like a character of hers berating another character for their promiscious behavior) in the same reply of hers for ten lines.\n\nI think it's fine to write dialogue like this, but if you do, you keep it short and wait for a reaction by your writing partner when their and your character are talking to each other, maybe you understand what I mean.

That said if someone has the same priorities as me on variable post lengths, reply frequency, themes of interest, it's rare that I'll be dissatisfied with the writing *style,* then it's more how they handle the *content*.\n\nWith that in mind, for me it'd be **replies that force me to do a lot of conversation backtracking and create lost time** because too much is happening in one post.\n\nThis means my character(s) can't respond naturally, big moments can lose their \"oomph\" or the direction gets oddly skewed. The upside is backtracking works out far more often if I'm with a partner that understands and can predict my characters well. They can get a feel for \"how much\" works and what dialogue would be contentious (or not). Some of my characters will absolutely not sit and listen without interrupting, others definitely will, and everything inbetween.\n\nRelated notable mention: styles with the wonkiest pacing. They blaze through actions and scenes so it feels like I'm an *observer* to \"their\" plot more than anything else.",

Line breaks after every few words, for no reason, causing even a paragraph or two to look unnecessarily long on the screen. \n\n- No sentence variety or punctuation use.
