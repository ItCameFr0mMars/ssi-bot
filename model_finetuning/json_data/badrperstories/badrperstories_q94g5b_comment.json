Plenty of people, especially in this sub, have standards for both etiquette and quality, from play style to world building to characters. Growing up and realizing you want more than the bare minimum isn't a sign of being a dickhead, it means you care more about your time and ideas than being a loosey goosey \"whatever works\" player. Many people start that way but as their interests and experiences grow and change, so do their tastes and expectations.\n\nAs long as you aren't in fact a dickhead about it, and maybe can even break down *why* the character doesn't seem good to you, it'll be easier to say for sure, but on principle, wanting more effort and actually care put into a character says you care about what you're doing and about the OC and you aren't there just to fulfill a need or play a part for your own gains. You want a story and to see things grow and for that, you need good characters and people who care equally.",

We all have pet peeves and things we need to be *just right* in order to truly enjoy a roleplay. \n\nWhen I first got into the roleplay community I would pretty much give it a shot with just about anyone who responded to my ads, and that hardly worked out well. Like you, the characters are important to me, as is the chemistry between them. I don't need characters written to be a *perfect match* for mine, but sometimes it feels like I'm just presented with an empty vessel, if that makes sense. And then there are those characters that just don't fit in with the story, when the writer wants their character to be a certain way and they just shoehorn it in despite it making zero sense or even becoming a huge burden to the story. \n\nIt's a bit of a fine line IMO, as part of what makes roleplaying so much fun is that there is a person on the other end with their own ideas and styles, but it does need to mesh to a certain extent with that you want for the roleplay yourself. Knowing what works for you and what doesn't is a good thing.",

Characters are arguably the most important part of roleplay. They can come with us across worlds and plots and be used over and over again.\n\nThat\u2019s why I love to write against people\u2019s premade characters, rather than ones they made up on the spot for the RP. New characters are great and all, but it takes time to develop personality and the idiosyncrasies that make them feel real, compelling, and complete.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to settle for the opposite of what you asked for, characters who are just vague concepts, or bland and uninspired ones. Ask for and expect characters who meet your standards! \n\nRequiring characters who feel well developed and are well written is not pretentious nor a dickhead move.",

If you manage to catch a few role plays, you start seeing what concepts in your oc work, and which not. You modify some details, because they don't seem to fit anymore. You iron out the kinks, and balance it out, to work in more kind of role plays; hence why I mentioned multiple different role plays.
