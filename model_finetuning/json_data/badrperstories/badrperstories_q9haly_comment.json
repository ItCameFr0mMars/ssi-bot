I know the Romans had their own gods separately for a while but after so much co-mingling it basically creates a series of duplicates deities with a lot of domain overlap, just a slightly different flavor so to speak, so unless he had some very obscure or specific variation details to include I can't think of a reason to include the Roman pantheon when there's likely a very easy fill in option in the Greek one.\n\nNow, if it was Egyptian or Norse then maybe that would make sense to include but if staff don't want to handle the hassle then that's up to them. Idk, nothing I think if makes him look at all reasonable or sympathetic, so probably for the best he be banned.",

But it does get boring after a bit, since other pantheons are a lot more concise on their demi-god creation in most iterations so worming in OCs is a little harder than just having 80% of your server be somewhat more than human via Zeus or Poseidon being skeezy because it makes sense.\n\nBut with that ease comes the laziness so really, to me, it seems like any Greco-Roman RP groups that don't have really strong lore in place tend to become \"lazy demi-god OC dumps\" after a while because it just becomes too easy to say \"I'm a demigod of [thing] because my mortal mother got boinked by Zeus during [this] in the form of [animal/object] therefore I have [character trait]\" and in any capacity it makes sense and is hard to argue because the source material supports the possibility. Formulaic behavior begets laziness after a while, even when well intentioned.",
