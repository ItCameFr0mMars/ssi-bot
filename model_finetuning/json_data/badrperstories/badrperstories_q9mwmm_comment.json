I was in an RP server and this person put out an ad saying they had lots of OCs, did all kinds of pairings, and stuff like \u201cyou\u2019ll love my OCs.\u201d They seemed really friendly in their ads, and the reason I asked the first question is because of their furry profile pic. I didn\u2019t know if they would be okay with humans with animal ears/tail since nothing in their ad stated that they were looking for furries only. At the time, I didn\u2019t know the term was known as kemonomimi or kitsunemimi. However, they really blew up at me over this misunderstanding. Even though this happened months ago, I no longer reply to RP ads and only put up my own because this particular instance made me afraid to respond to ads. It also gave me a very bad first impression of furry RPers in general. (If you\u2019re a furry and you\u2019re reading this, I hope you\u2019re not all like this.)",

But then again, given their watered down explanation of the Kitsune, their image examples, yet never talking about anything in the y\u014dkai to show the actual distinctions between Kitsune vs Kitsunemimi? Eeeh. You definitely dodged a bullet on that one as I have a feeling they've not even read much y\u014dkai folklore.   \n\n\nAs someone who RPs a lot of IRL practices and cultures, if I find someone that obviously doesn't have the knowledge base that I do? I see it as a wonderful opportunity to talk about my favorite things about that as a good jumping point to collaborate something different. At the same time, it seems like this individual also didn't clearly list their expectations. If they had a lot of OCs, did all kinds of pairings, and saying \"You'll love my OCs\"? That's a pretty wide net without specific expectations. The way they follow up your clarification question just drips with venom. Yiiiiiiiikes.",

One that is a fox woman (as Kitsune's are known to transform into beautiful women), an anthro fox, and the actual yokai. \n\n*They* were the ones who made the assumption it was an antro fox just based on \"kitsune\" as a descriptor and then *they* were the ones who got pissy when your character didn't fit their assumption rather than apologizing and clarifying that they were only looking for anthro character specifically. On top of that, they insult the character by calling them a \"weird-looking human bitch\" and then tried to say that they were sure that you stole the artwork, but didn't want to claim that you did which is just... if you don't want to claim someone did then don't say it to start with?\n\nAlso, as an artist myself if someone shows me artwork of their character, it isn't my position to determine (or assume) whether or not they stole or commissioned it. Even if they got it from Pinterest, I'm not there to draw with/for them. I'm there to write or roleplay. They're using an image to represent the character in what is presumably a relatively private roleplay, not posting it on social media to get credit for something they didn't do.",

I think I responded to this post the first time I saw it about exactly that because you weren't wrong with the use of the term kitsune.\n\nThis just shows though that the... I guess you can call it \"furry weeb vocabulary\" is very strict and doesn't allow for outside interpretation? I say furry because I know the community has their own system of vocab for referring to animal types, and even the level of \"furriness\"; and I saw weeb because frankly only the overlap of anime needs and furries tend to refer to fox characters as kitsunes because UwU or something? I say this as someone who has a fox Sona that is both a fox and kitsune because, per lore, she IS a fox that gained power after hundreds of years and gained a human form as one of those abilities.\n\nNeither are wrong but the other person was definitely a dick about it and in some terms, wrong simply because they refuse to acknowledge or understand the term kitsune has multiple definitions because Japanese is VERY CONTEXTUAL. Because of that, I personally only use kitsune to refer to spirit foxes of Japanese origin, and fox for literally anything else.",

Being an animatronic fox =/= kitsune. As far as I\u2019m aware now, kitsune have foxlike characteristics, which is true, but the one thing they all have in common is having specific supernatural powers. So yeah, she has her own definition of what a kitsune is without taking into consideration that it\u2019s a very broad term. Therefore, not only was she being extremely rude, but also very arrogant.",

            "body": "Yeah, they really weren't wrong. There were a lot of distinctions in Kitsune lore throughout East-Asian folklore. Most know them from y\u014dkai folklore, but really there's a lot of overlap in other countries (China for instance) which was what I enjoyed a lot as it got me looking into other cultures at the same time. What stuck out with me about the y\u014dkai's Kitsunes is that there's two main categories for them; good and wild. Then you have sub-categories based on color; gold, silver, black, and white foxes. The Tenko stood out the most because if I remember right, those were the closest to being a deity, or being just as powerful, but it's been a long while since then.\n\nBut one of the main things about Kitsunes is that they shapeshift. Which was always depicted as them deciding how the form looked in which they were about to take/able to take. In a lot of those depictions, fox characteristics were often carried over to the human form \u2014 most generally the face, but not limited to. Which is something that a lot of skim-readers miss, I suppose?",

You were right, that sort of character isn't a furry, and he should have picked up on the context clues before you even sent the reference pic that an anthro wasn't what you were talking about, lmao. \n\nI don't want to get all 'internet RP historian' here, but this person is just *wrong*. In the English RP world, it's commonly understood that terms like 'neko' and 'kitsune' generally reference characters who are human with various animal traits like ears and tails (those being cat and fox respectively), with 'kemonomimi' being the broad umbrella term for the concept. Obviously, these words mean different things in Japanese, but generally in the English-speaking *RP community*, this has been the case for well over a decade and a half at this point. \n\n(This is similar to the way that 'yaoi' used to be a blanket term for all mxm content at one point but has fallen out of style because most of the internet has gotten a bug up its ass over fujoshi).",
