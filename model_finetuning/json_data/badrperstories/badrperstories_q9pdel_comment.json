The kind of people that lead you on saying they wanna do a certain plot but then change the whole thing once you start without discussing it.\n\nPeople who proclaim they're still interested but never post and always give excuses. \n\nPushy partners who bug me left and right if I am gonna post/wanna RP.  I just said I'm not in the mood at the moment! \n\nPeople that start to guilt trip me because they're lonely and depressed and RPing makes them feel better. \n\nI know, it's a lot.

And *still* don't say anything OOC.  \n* Having to majorly warp your own characters in order to interact with their characters because the RP can't possibly go anywhere otherwise; especially when you've already tried to meet them half way.\n* Never letting their characters have a chance to do badly or fail.  (Or always interfering when you let your character fail.)  Let the confident one get knocked down a peg. Let the expert have an *off* day. Sometimes, *sh\\*t happens*.  Create some tension!  Let them suffer, and deal with the consequences.\n* When (their) main character gets completely overshadowed by (their) npcs into an unspoken retirement, rather than just saying they want to switch mains (or admitting they never really wanted to play that one in that one in the first place).\n* Not communicating with you sucks. But not hearing you out either? That sucks, too.\n\nThe biggest button-pusher for me: \n\n* *Fainting Goat Syndrome. (aka. Catatonic Coping Mechanism)*  Characters that constantly, *repeatedly* pass out, short-circuit, or zone out in a state of catatonia every time things get \\~stressful\\~, so your character is left dealing with an unresponsive meatbag for the umpteenth time. Usually it's just because (a) they want their character to be fussed over right this second, or (b) they just don't feel like writing for their character for a bit.
