I also reported his account for being underage. \n\nThe guy proceeded to ban evade and make 6 (SIX!) alt accounts (several of which he was pretending to be someone else to try to trick me) to try to get me to RP with him. I kept blocking/reporting each time without responding.\n\nA few months later, I get a random DM on Discord from him...which was doubly upsetting, because I don't post my discord handle publicly and have NO idea how he got it. He half guilt tripped half begged half went off on me for not wanting to RP with him because he just \"looovvvedddd my OC\". I just blocked him again.\n\nI think he finally got the hint because I haven't heard from him in awhile, but it was a very uncomfortable situation. :(",

            "body": "There was this guy I knew first on a forum RP site. He joined a group I was in that was based on a Roman town that had just been ransacked by vikings or something (idk it was years ago). My character was a Vestal Virgin, and in her bio, I implied that her and the other Vestals were assaulted and pillaged, but I also put something in that suggested my character hid and wasn't hurt. It was intentionally kept very vague because I personally don't believe in the whole \"female character is only worth something if virgin\" trope, I don't think it matters for the story and a hymen is not indicative of anything. So yeah, intentionally kept vague.\n\nThis guy messaged me after joining the story to ask if I can confirm that my character is a virgin. I told him I didn't see how that mattered, but he could attempt to find out in play. He laughed and then talked down to me about how \"traditionally, in RP, this is relevant information that would be discussed ahead of time for our characters to be together.\" I'm not new to RP, nor was I at that time. I replied that that might be true in a 1v1 story, this was a group game and my character didn't know his so at present a romance between them wasn't even on the table.\n\nHe got kind of pissy but left me alone. Then a bit later, he joined a GoT story I was in and kept trying to force our characters into a marriage that made 0 sense. I eventually left that server to focus on my own game. He followed me in there, but by then, my character was dating someone else. He asked if I could please have my character dump them to get with his character. I said no. Then he asked if he could please read the private RP where my character lost her virginity. And when my character's boyfriend died in play, he asked me to rewind all her development so far just to make her a virgin so his character could have her. And this is what I mean about not buying into the \"only worth something if virgin.\" My character, by then, had been through so much that tied into her boyfriend dying that rewinding it would undo all of her story, just so he could get his jollies? Fucking no thank you?\n\nHe would refuse to write with anyone who wasn't playing a virgin student for his Professor character to hit on. It's not exactly pedo since the server's a University setting, but it was still creepy that he only wanted to interact with virgins. He started getting close to this one player who had only just turned 18. OOC, he would compliment her every day, whenever she posted a selfie, he was spamming it with heart reacts. She felt uncomfortable and told him to stop, which to his credit, he did...for like a month. Then later, another younger (18) player joined and needed help finding a PB. He helped her pick one out and tailor it to his romantic preferences. We had to reject the PB because it was Millie Bobby Brown, who at that time was 14 or so. They tried to argue that she looked like she could pass for 18 (not even a little) and that it shouldn't matter when the character was 18.\n\nWe stood our grounds, and then this guy starts messaging me about how messed up it was for me to stick to this. Still stood my ground. The player ended up applying an older actress as a PB, but an actress who had been acting since childhood and the player would often use the very-obviously-childhood pictures of the actress in their outfit boards. We told her to stop numerous times, then just started auto-deleting them whenever she posted them. Finally she got pissed with fighting with us vs trying to make the guy happy and left. We found out then that irl the guy teaches middle school English and we were just so creeped out. Before the staff and I could even put it to a vote to remove him as a predator, the other players put two and two together and just bullied him out.",

My cyberstalker has been making new characters to basically ship with everyone there since there's no fresh blood. The individuals from the third linked story have moved onto other games. Rumor has it they changed, but I doubt it considering that this woman would also blame the weirdest \"I didn't want or need to know that\" things.   \n\n\nThe runner up has to be the guy that was hyperfocusing all the monogamous gay characters. [I've told this story before](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/pw04le/feeling_egged_on_to_start_a_romance_with_someone/hef60tv/?context=3), but to recap? Because he couldn't get with this other character and live happily ever after, the character went off to visit his mother's grave and then had his character 'die' (death isn't permanent in this setting). A lot of us immediately were like, \"NOPE.\" An update with them though is that their character is with one of my cyberstalker's alts (it's her MO along with the same syntax) and he's also stealing my alt's personality now without really understanding why my alt was the way he was.",

            "body": "Someone joined a site I was on with a character around forty years old. They plotted actively, which was great! Except for the fact that they only posted in the shippers of male teen characters. The site was 18+ OOC but allowed characters 16+, and there were four or five of those on the site, plus another half a dozen or so 18/19 year old characters. We're trying not to assume that it's inherently creepy that a middle-aged gay character has only plotted with teenage boys, but we're all thinking it.\n\nThen the player calls an adult character \"rape bait\" and describe how, if their character ever killed anyone, he would cut out their eyes to carry around in a jar of preserving liquid as a trophy. They then called other members 'pussies' and 'little bitches' for telling them that that was inappropriate.\n\nOn top of all this, they made the character to fill a romantic request I'd put up but ignored me after the character was accepted. And they posted in multiple shippers asking if other players would be willing to ship with them, and got mad when those players went \"doesn't that character already have a ship since you made him for a wanted?\"",

            "body": "I once had a partner for a couple months, everything was fine OOC and IC. We found out we played the same MMO on the same server and started playing together in that game. Eventually they joined the FC I was in (a guild essentially) and it was no big deal because by this point they'd merged into my friend group and really truly didn't have any red flags. They never rushed me to post, never asked me for nudes, never touched any inappropriate subjects IC or OOC.   \n\n\nAnd then everything changed when the fire nation attacked. (When he saw a picture of me.)  \n\n\nI'm not particularly shy or private about my appearance but unless asked by a pre-existing friend I won't just send / offer a picture. So sometime after them being in the FC with my friends and I we were posting pictures of us with our pets and I had one of me on my bed buried alive under my rescue doges.   \n\n\nThis man went from 0 to 100 really quick. He constantly started trying to be in private voice calls with me, which unless you're someone I'm close to I just won't typically do because I like my quiet time as much as I like voice chatting. They followed me around everywhere in game all the time if I was on and would send whispers of things they wanted to do and flirting non stop. If I wasn't online they'd message me on discord and any other social sites we had each other on.   \n\n\nMIND YOU! This man is trying to seriously get me to date him when he has a \"baby momma\" and two kids irl. I'm not subtle at all, I'm a blunt opinionated person and it rubs people the wrong way. I say this because there is no doubt in my mind I was transparently clear with him. I didn't turn him down softly or try to be nice I flat out said: \"This is creepy. I'm not currently nor have I ever been interested in you and tbh I seriously doubt I ever will be. So stop saying this shit to me, I don't like it, and I don't like you in a romantic sense.\"    \n\n\nThings only escalated from there to the point where I removed him from my friends list so he couldn't message me on most outside sites and stuff because if there's an option to make it so only friends or people you know can message you, I have that active. He gets removed from the FC because the FC knows about / has seen the harassment, and I just start doing my own thing in new places in game to avoid him. Don't ask me why I didn't flat out block him in game, my only reasoning looking back on it was I hadn't blocked anyone in game yet and simply didn't think to.   \n\n\nEither way after a while of ignoring his messages and him escalating more he comes across me hanging out chit chatting in one of the main cities in the MMO. I don't remember completely what all was said by other people afterwards but I said nothing to this man before hand and he opened up the conversation with.   \n\n\nTW: &gt;!\"You live in \\*insert my city here\\* and I know your name and face. I'm going to leave my baby momma, find you and rape you and make you have my babies.\"!&lt;  \n\n\nHe said that in a public chat filled with people I know and people I don't. Needless to say he was mass reported (I had reported him on my own a few times by this point). And he was forced to move to a different server so we couldn't cross paths again. (Side note: NO I did not ever directly tell him where I was from and as far as I remember, that wasn't listed on any of the social sites I used back then.)  \n\n\nSo that's the very long story of how an RP partner became an absolute creep ooc towards me. I'm sorry it's so long @.@ I tried to skip out all the instances of stuff happening and just leave in the big points but it still ended up being longer than I expected.",

            "body": "I also have a creepy pedo story that I accidentally played into for a short while. I joined an open group for a small fandom, right when it was made so there were a lot of characters that needed to be picked up to make it work. I chose to play one of the thirteen year olds as a side character. This girl had picked up his father figure, so of course started messaging me to try to set things up.   \n\n\nI noticed right away that she didn't seem...all there socially. Having a best friend who is autistic, I noticed a few similarities, especially how badly she reacted to simple social mistakes or people not wanting to RP with her, her strange characterization and writing, it all lined up. Feeling kind of bad, I usually just did whatever she wanted, which was fine for a while.   \n\n\nAfter the group lost its shine and some inactives left, it was just a handful of us and we all became friends and opened up. Her odd tendencies turned more creepy OOC, and she was prone to jealousy. If I was RPing with another person, she would demand we both make plots with her and try to take up so much time that we would end up just RPing with her. She shared a lot of stories about how people thought she was weird and she didn't have many friends, so the rest of the group and I all agreed to just humor her and if we had to, continue our RPs in DMs. She would make references to suicidal thoughts if she thought we didn't like her.  \n\n\nThe IC creepiness began when she suggested a plot that would let our characters bond more. My character, who is THIRTEEN, should sleep in her ADULT MIDDLE AGED MAN'S bed because he's scared of a thunderstorm. I was uncomfortable with it but had talked myself into 'oh, she's harmless, she just doesn't understand' bullshit and decided to do it but keep it short. She dragged it out as hard as she could, insisting my character bathe and change into HER CHARACTER'S OVERSIZED SHIRT and then CRADLED HIM TO HIS CHEST. Again, my character was thirteen years old. A very rough thirteen year old, at that, one who had been living independently of parents or other adults for a while.   \n\n\nAgain, I just tried to not send her into one of her little suicide trips and let it slide. Then she began talking about how my character should wear onsies and should sleep in her character's bed every night. She talked about him sucking his thumb and holding her character's hand constantly or trying to sit in his lap. I tried to politely set her on the right track, once again giving her the benefit of the doubt, but she would fight it in a way that made me realize she knew what she was doing and she had been playing myself and all the other polite people like fiddles.   \n\n\nI don't like to think about where she was intending to push me. I really don't like that I presented myself as such a doormat that she thought she could.   \n\n\nRemember, saying no is easy, quick, and free!",

            "body": "Got DMed by someone who saw my post history referring to scifi themed settings and asked if xenomorphs and facehuggers would exist in my setting. I said no, with the only allowance being for aesthetic modification to appear as a xeno, no actual xenomorphic behavior or eggs or anything. I was already wise to the fact the facehuggers have a kind of fetish around them so when they pushed a bit I checked their history and found exactly what I thought: excessive fetish, kink and porn subs that told me it wasn't just a desire to be Ripley driving the hunt for xenomorphs. I think I blocked them thereafter because I really didn't want to deal with more, there's a time and place for face hugging face fuckers but my personal settings is not one of them.",

            "body": "Oooooh now\u2019s my time to shine!\n\nOkay, so I was in this fantasy D&amp;D type of roleplay server. There was this guy in there who was a literal nazi. He had a Pepe the frog profile picture and spoke in 4chan jargon, and was rude OOC. He would butt in to RPs that didn\u2019t involve him and type stuff OOC like \u201cno metagaming r*tard\u201d completely unwarranted when he wasn\u2019t even a mod. I don\u2019t know if the mods ever told him off for that bc not only was that abrasive af, but also likely counts as mini-modding. \n\nI did RP with him before and his character was alright, but later on he would DM me and it was normal at first, then admitted to me that he would \u201cfedpost\u201d which is why his accounts kept getting deleted. I was already growing really suspicious until he basically outed himself as a Nazi. He would say how minorities are destroying Europe and he wanted to secure the white race for the future of his people. Hell, he even self-identified as a fascist. He even sent me a dog pic (presumably his dog) which had \u201c1488\u201d on the corner of the pic. If you don\u2019t know what that means, Google it. Just yikes all around. Knowing all of this, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable RPing in that server anymore and left. \n\nNo, I never told the mods, but I probably should have because they were harboring a literal Nazi in their fucking server. I just hope this guy eventually got banned and is on an FBI watchlist.",
