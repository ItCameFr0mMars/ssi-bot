After two superficial, social media-ish interactions of his character telling my alt that he was hot? My alt was somehow husband material and he was already planning the wedding. Why did this piss me off? Because he was ticking all of his fetish boxes on my character, by *force*. This includes my character's preference in the bedroom. He'd said at first that he hooked characters up for their stories. Found out that was a lie because he'd said that my main of four and a half years had no story at all. Compared to my alt on his third rewrite who ended up getting deleted anyway.\n\nTo the other bit about the atmospheric set piece? It feels like he wanted you to come up with the setting. He didn't care, so long as it ticked his fetish boxes. When you sent him that list of things in the google doc? It shows that you go into detail, something he probably doesn't do well himself.\n\nRegardless, people like this are one-dimensional time wasters and I simply just don't entertain them after the second, \"Let me know what you want to do\" after I've given them the prompts of what I'm willing to do.",

Am I the ass here for demanding a clear cut answer? Or is this a thing that people do?\n\nThe vibe I'm getting is that the other person is comfortable with making background details up as the RP rolls along, while you seem to be the type who wants details nailed down before starting. As you've noticed, you can infer some details of the background from his short passage (high tech, on the edge of civilization) and he was probably expecting you to establish more details on your turn (the planet, the races, etc). He took pains to point out he's flexible (except when it comes to geisha attire lol) so would probably have accepted whatever you chose, that still fits the scene he had in mind.\n\nI can't speak for other people, but for myself I would say yes, I've started RP's with just a powerful opening scene in mind, then figured out the details later with my partner. On the other hand, I would probably be able to describe the setting in more words than this dude did, even with just the opening to guide me, so I think there's some basic communication failure as well. If it were me, I'd start the convo with \"I have this scene in mind...\" then worked with my partner on finding characters and setting that fits.",
