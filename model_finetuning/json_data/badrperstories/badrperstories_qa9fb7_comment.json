I also find modern settings very boring, but once again, it's not really hard to find people who also prefer fantasy and sci fi. \n\nI'd have to say the only type of RP I'm super not into that occasionally turns up answering my ads is what I would call a Light ERPer. These are players whose characters think about their genitals and genital feelings from literally the first post, because they're just that horny and therefore so is their character. They don't want to rp with open ERPers, because they don't want to negotiate with other people's kinks, but they also don't want to wait on the story developing to the point of their preferred smut type, so they're going to claim they want a regular RP and then \"test the waters\" as early and as often as possible. If their hints aren't picked up on, they ghost.\n\nI don't like these Light ERPers because they are dishonest about what they want right up until the actual RP starts, and they waste my time. They might tolerate some story elements in their smut, but what they really want is porn with plot, not an actual story with a beginning, middle, end, maybe a five-act structure, etc. More than once I've wasted time plotting with someone only to be ghosted because my characters didn't respond to their horny IC stuff the way they wanted. And they're very hard to screen early unless they also give an egregiously horny writing sample (some have been kind enough to do that and save both of us time).",

It's extremely obvious when they mention specific traits and personalities they are looking for but have typical and extrodinarily plain ones regarding their own character. \n\nIronically I don't mind the fetishism, I get it some people really want that estranged relationship or romance with a bad boy, mafia, yakuza, serial killer, viking man, or whatever have you. My issue is the lack of honesty in the request; if someone is going to do a self-insert then just admit it ya'know? \n\nFor the record yes, a lot of writers at the very least put a tiny portion of themselves into their characters.
