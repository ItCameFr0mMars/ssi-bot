            "body": "Yep! Roleplay occurs in many different places under many different rules. You\u2019re not necessarily sheltered though. Just different. \n\nJust the other day I met a potential partner who kept insisting that I was \u2018looking for short term RP\u2019 because I stated I preferred rapid-fire with 1-4 paragraphs at the moment. They likely started roleplaying on forums, google docs, etc, something like that, where the norm is novella and responses every day or two days, which is what they proposed- despite me telling them \u2018no, long-term is what I like, I simply want shorter posts at the moment because I\u2019m burnt out\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely annoying when they insinuate you\u2019re a \u2018certain kind of RPer\u2019 or \u2018not doing it right\u2019. That\u2019s just human nature though, whatever is different to your norm or truth may seem incorrect wholly as opposed to different.\n\nI\u2019ve definitely gotten your experience before OP. One person began spamming periods in our RP chat every time I left the RP for more than a few minutes without responding, then deleting them to hide them (meaning they KNEW they were being a dick, but I caught them as my phone allows me to view the notifications for the deleted messages and see their content). They also thought they could control my characters if I was not playing them in first person, unlike our \u2018mains\u2019- literally making one of my characters abusive. They were ALSO an *italics* roleplayer so when I made a 1-2 paragraph starter with standard punctuation, they got confused and asked me \u2018aren\u2019t we roleplaying?\u2019\n\nLastly, this happened yesterday\u2026 I post a smut prompt for a student/teacher romance and I get some person trying to flirt with me over Reddit chat as if we were the characters in question. \n\nAll of these things aren\u2019t people being stupid or necessarily bad people- they\u2019re just completely conditioned to other forms of RP and probably think similar things of us. Don\u2019t think you have to \u2018fit in\u2019- just understand we\u2019ve all had different experiences. Find a good middle ground between what you know, what you enjoy and what your potential partner enjoys.",

            "body": "Every role-play medium, from where play takes place to general partner finding absolutely has developed it's own distinct culture, norms, and expectations. Being almost thirty myself and having been role-playing from a very young age across different platforms, I can tell you there are a few standards but usually expectations are different.\n\nAny kind of instant message service, in this case discord, has the expectation of sitting down for several hours and pumping out posts repeatedly or at the very least multiple a day ( especially with the ease that mobile devices provide ). Most who are used to this do take a day or so away without notice as an oddity ( in the sense of against the norm ) and get at the very least concerned. \n\nSuch however is the direct contrast to what is forum style, where posting is less frequent but also usually bigger which often too has a greater emphasis on post formating. Gaia Online is a good example, where role-plays could last months and years but have not nearly enough 'instant posts' to match the passing of days. Usually people with forum style are much more lenient with time. \n\nOf course all have their outliers. I use Discord these days but I do strictly inform my partners there may be days of very few, if any posts because of my available time. If your concerned of offending a partner, just let them know off the bat what they should expect and what you expect. \n\nI've met many who still prefer relaxed scheduling or simply 'post when you can' styles. I'd say in this day and age more people are interested in rapid fire, but the opposite still exist in a solid number. \n\nAs a fun fact, if you pay attention to ads on the various mediums ( and the user base of them in general ) you'll notice trends that exist with them that may not exist in others too that define their culture. A simple one: Reddit seems to favor in a lot of cases the use of RL references, while others may prefer artistic ones or that of particular aesthetics.",

But maybe that also has to do with me only really seeking out novella style writers. Hell, sometimes slower paced than that. If they don't put a time requirement in their ad, it's typically a free for all for how long it might take for replies. I certainly don't expect daily replies unless they state they are looking for such in their ads.\n\nOf course, even there I still find impatient roleplayers. Like, if they say they want daily replies in their ad, then I'll know that in advance... But I've had someone who's contacted me straight up go off on me because it took me 2 days to get them a reply. Of which. I was *busy*, and I told them as such. But they said I was unreliable. &gt;.&gt;;   \nAnd in that case... Fucking, bye then! Later! \n\nSo yeah. I see stories of people being more uppity about replies here on reddit more so than where I roleplay, but it's not totally unique to reddit either.",

I used to sit there and to for hours haha it was always rappid fire shorter answers and I had a hard time with forums because the lengthy answers were hard for me to write and I was impatient for the replies taking days. I've learn to be patient as I got more mature \n\nI wrote so many short answers and rapid fire rp and they lasted a long time! The stories were well developed and took a while to end but of course in the real life time line it's shorter because you progress more often with quick answers than if you answer every couple of days. \n\n\n\nI'm sorry about the whole flirting thing...I've heard that one a lot. Still haven't happened to me but I also never posted on a smut sub Reddit. I honestly didn't know it existed for rp.",
