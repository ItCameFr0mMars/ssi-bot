Be it politely asking them not to, OR, telling them they need to consult with you first OOC.\n\nThe poking for replies thing just sounds annoying honestly. I wouldn't know *how* to combat that other than just being like, \"this isn't working out\", because I think that would just annoy me more than it being a 'fixable' problem. I wouldn't know how to say \"cut that shit out\" politely haha \n\nBest of luck though!",

Bringing it up won't make them better at it. Is this an issue you can live with?\n\nLike the other commenter said, you should absolutely bring up the fact they write your character for you! I would phrase it something like, \"Hey, I should have said something sooner, but I would appreciate if you let me write what my character is doing/thinking. There's not much for me to do if I don't get to control my own character.\"\n\nDefinitely ask for clarification on the plot, too. \"I'm getting a little confused about everything that's going on. Do you think you could summarize where you're going with the plot, and could we collaborate more going forward?\"\n\nBothering you for posts is totally unacceptable. Next time they do it, you should make your boundaries clear. \"Hey, I get you're excited about the RP and that's great! But just because I'm online doesn't mean I'm RPing. Please tone it back to every 24 hours if I haven't replied yet.\"\n\nThis is all only if you *want* this partnership to work out. Only you can decide that! If I want to stay friends/maintain any sort of good rapport with a person, I bring up issues I have with them. If I'm not enjoying their company/the writing partnership in the first place, I bow out. Only you know whether it's something you want to try to fix. Best of luck; I hope RP improves for you soon whatever you decide to do!",

            "body": "All I know is, I spent WAY too much time (years, oy) being too polite to end things when I wasn't clicking with my RP partner, the plot was not going how I wanted it, it wasn't enjoyable, and just having no muse and RPing anyway. If you're still in the RP only because it'd be rude to leave, then leave. There's no reason to stay.\n\nThere's many social factors to consider. Like, are they part of a group you're part of, or do you intend to RP again later, or are you friends with them outside the RP, and on and on. These factors determine how much sugar-coating you need to add, or whether to just be blunt, straightforward, to the point. \n\nI'm usually the straightforward type. If they ask why, I tell them why, but generally I don't give reasons unless asked. Something like, \"Hey, I can't RP with you anymore. Best of luck to you in your endeavors.\"\n\nIf you need to preserve your partner's feelings, you can add layers of sugar-coating. \"I'm sorry about this. You're a great person. {Sandwich technique, list a positive of their RP}. Unfortunately, I can't RP with you anymore. {Or whatever negative, \"I'm finding it hard to control my OC how I want when you write them, and I'd appreciate if you don't do that in the future.} {List another positive here.}\" \n\nWhen/if you explain your reasons, a technique I've [learned elsewhere](https://youtu.be/lT1o2esE_88?t=258) that's useful is to frame things as coming from yourself, rather than from them. \"I felt x\" rather than \"You did this.\" \n\nGood luck, dude.",

I've known people who will keep rping even though they are exhausted, but they never say they are tired, aaand then they blame the other rper...\n\n\nAlways be open and honest! A good rp partner is like a good therapist, someone who is open to hearing whats going on in your head, and working with you to help make it, make sense... at least, that's my opinion",
