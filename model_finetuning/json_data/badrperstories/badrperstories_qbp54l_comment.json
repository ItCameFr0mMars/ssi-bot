So bizarre...If your character is built around ERP, sure have at it but if it stems just to get attention well, that trope fizzles out real quick.",

I get this can't be retroactively fixed now but if they'd do it with the server owner they'd do it to others.\n\nSame with Rping cheating within the same group without a check-in with the players, might not be a violation but its a powderkeg of drama waiting to happen.\n\n&gt;11. They would keep telling mods (specifically me) to \u201cstfu\u201d when telling them to stop something, self explanatory.\n\nyeah seriously they should have been kicked at point#1.

I recognize this is easier said than done if you're not used to having to deal with these types, but don't give them the time of day.\n\nIf you haven't already, OP, I strongly recommend rewriting your server rules to ensure you can kick problem players like these very swiftly in the future and not have to go through this whole rigamarole again.\n\nI think a lot of group RPs have this problem where they think having more players is inherently better and are reluctant to reject or kick out players like these, but players like these do not contribute to the roleplay at all, and are actively detrimental to the atmosphere. Once they've demonstrated they have no respect for boundaries, just get rid of them. I can pretty much guarantee no one will be mourning their absence.",
