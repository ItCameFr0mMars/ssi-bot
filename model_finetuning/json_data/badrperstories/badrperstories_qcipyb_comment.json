Except you have a guild plot that literally *only you can run* that all of us are hung up on and *can't advance unless you run it*.\n\nOne dude's main OC was stuck missing for months (can't play/RP main?!?!), same dude's alt-main was injured for weeks also, my main OC was cursed (more or less incapable of jack) for weeks, meanwhile everyone else with relations to any of our OCs was RPing like, \"Well we better help them, meanwhile I feel sad because my friend/lover/brother/boss is missing/cursed/injured and **I really wish we could do something about it**.\"\n\nMeanwhile, I'm an officer in said guild, fielding questions and complaints, with the whole \"shrug I dunno\" answer. \n\nI am apparently \"needy\" and \"clingy\" for relaying these concerns and asking questions. \n\nWorth mentioning, that this guild ran server-wide RP events as plot points. (The same plot points we need to free up our RP mains.) They flopped in popularity. Oh, and caused GM and other dude to fight constantly. (Helps that the GM wanted to god-mode it, treat RP OCs as NPCs for his story line, then when someone inevitably derails the plot, he pulls a Rocks-Fall-Everyone-Dies type moment. Then literally flees the scene and leaves the officers to clean the mess up.) \n\nSo, inevitably, I throw up my hands, and suggest he relegate authority to officers to run events to advance the plot. GM's very much like, \"WELL FINE if you think you can run events, then BE MY GUEST!\" So, myself and 2 other officers organize an event. It's actually quite popular. RPers from other guilds leave pleased. Our guild members had fun, and were very vocal about it. \n\nGM could not accept it gracefully. He criticized everything. And refused to RP with any of us. So, invariably, the rest of the officers get together and engineer RPs privately to resolve these injuries, curses, missing statuses, start making plot up because WELP the GM won't tell us what's going on and won't run anything and won't RP privately to resolve any of it. \n\nI left not long after.",

If the GM was so distracted and had no time to advance the plot, then why not let the officers do it and take some of the weight off their shoulders?

Like I get it, they started the thing, it wouldn't be there without them and they deserve credit, but some members just trip over themselves trying to suck their toes. I simply cannot believe you are that invested in a plot that gets a reply maybe once every 3 months. \n\nBoth mods in one group I'm in are like how you described. They have a ton of characters and plots so that some invariably get neglected. When they do respond its in batches and it's clear that they spent maybe 10 minutes writing a bland cardboard post.",

They start to get discouraged, and in order to keep the purity of their idea in tact, they introduce rigid rules and structures.\n4. The Cynic Stage, when they've had a nice community going on their server for a while, but things like real life and drama have made the 'OG' crew drop out. The replacements just \"aren't the same,\" and it fees like RP quality has gone down.\n5.
