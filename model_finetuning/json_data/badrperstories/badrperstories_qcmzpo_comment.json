I mean, from what you write here you did discuss the matter later on, but how is that even possible if she ghosted you?\n\nHow unique are your ideas? For example: GOT-style roleplays with bastard sons and a lot of intrigues are extremely common. I have multiple roleplays which are loosely inspired by medieval inspired fantasy plotlines, and they often include similiar elements. Still, I didn't get these ideas from my partners, they're just really common in that kind of fiction and often used as a basis for roleplays.   \nIf it was something not very specific, I could very well believe that she was working on something similiar with a partner. This all depends on how unique your setting was, are scenes the exact same, and how common those ideas are in general.\n\nSame with the title of the story...If it was something like 'The cursed kingdom' and the other one was called 'The haunted kingdom' I would probably just think that this person is not very creative when it comes to making up roleplaying titles.",

            "body": "No, that is why I think the level of detail and how 'unique' it is is key. \nLater can mean different things, it can mean later that day, or just a general 'later, when I have written my starter'. Nowhere in your search does it mention post frequency as far as I'm aware. I believe that you having a standard like 'If there is no starter in 24 hours, that is too long and I will believe that you don't want to write the roleplay with me.' that is totally valid. But if someone told me 'Hey, you ghosted me, it's obvious that you don't want to write with me anymore, bye.' after such a short time (in the forum I'm part of, it's totally normal that people need like two or three days, sometimes even a week), I would be....confused, to be honest. That is why I ask you if you discussed post frequency with her. Because 24 hours doesn't sound like a long time for me at all, and I think it's important if she has known that standard of yours beforehand. Or if you just assumed that it's common courtesy. Especially if you didn't try to contact her and write something like 'How is your starter going?' I personally wouldn't consider it ghosting at all. Unless you clearly communicated that expectation.\n\nAnother example, there is a certain type of character that I like to write in almost every roleplay. Let's say it's the bastard son of a king who has to go into hiding because some people don't want him to claim the throne (it's just an made up example). I might apply to searches where people mention searching exactly for that kind of character, or searches where I think people might appreciate me writing him. If you would write a roleplay with me, and I open a new one, you might think 'Hey, that theme is very similiar, and Nachtreihers character is similiar as well!'\nBut in the end, the roleplays will end up being completely different, it's just that I like the theme and it's a basic premise for most of the roleplays I'm looking for.\n\nI can totally get that you felt disappointed when you saw the subreddit, and I'm not saying that it's impossible that she copied something (I would need a lot more info to determine that). But I can't help but feel like there might be also some communication issues going on. Can you tell me a precise example of what element was copied? How did you confront her and how did she react when she was confronted?",

From the other side of the isle, I encounter this frequently. Sometimes I'll really like the ideas a person has, but the more I talk to them OOC the more I realize we just aren't going to get along, so I end things before they begin or maybe a few posts in.
