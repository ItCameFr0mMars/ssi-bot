            "body": "First of all, I'm glad you've found a style that suits you and congratulations on finding something you enjoy!\n\nSlow-burn is a lot of fun, and well worth the long build up. In fact, the build up to it is probably the most important part, so you want to throw a lot of tension in for the characters involved. They should be in situations that help them forge a closer bond, but for whatever reason, the romance itself is delayed. It depends on the plot you're creating, but it helps if they have personal reasons not to rush into a relationship as well as external influences working against them to slow things down.\n\nIt can be tempting every time a saucy moment crops up to have a character \"go for it,\" so you guys should be communicative about how long you want the \"burn\" to go on. At a certain point it will only make sense for someone to finally make a move, but you don't want to do it before the writers are both ready!\n\nOnce the romance starts officially, however, you can always keep throwing wrenches in it. With these longterm RPs, it's totally okay if the characters have fights and arguments. It's okay if something outside of their control separates them for a little while and they have to find each other again. It's part of the drama and the story.\n\nI find it helpful to keep a sort of timeline of notes, because when you're doing a few posts a day it can be easy to forget what happened/was said in the RP if you wrote it months ago.\n\nOther than that, as long as you're a considerate writing partner and your co-pilot feels comfortable communicating with you, you're not likely to go wrong. Don't overthink it if you're both having a good time!",

            "body": "I'm sorry that your experience started in a place that was so inappropriate for someone your age. I hope you're doing okay  now and I'm happy you've found joy in the roleplaying you're doing today!\n\nFor character and plot driven RP, I usually think about the past, present, and future of both. For my character: what happened in their life up until now? And how did that affect who they are today? What were their aspirations in the past and are they different now? What are their goals, and how do they plan to get there? How do all of these things fit into the plot? And for the plot itself, this of course would be discussed with your partner but everyone likes when you can bring your own ideas to the table too. What is the history/background of this world (if not a fandom or realistic setting)? What are the state of things now? What's the issue or the conflict your characters will be facing? What sort of things do you want to have happen down the road?\n\nI think by focusing on these things more than romance and smut, the latter two will fall to the wayside a little and be less to worry about.\n\nIn terms of post, I don't see the need for you to push yourself to write exponentially more than usual. Try starting off with 1-2 more detailed/lengthy posts a day and work your way up until you're used to it. And if you feel you can do more in a day, go for it! But you can set your own standards for your own posting frequency based on what you're comfortable and happy with. \n\nOtherwise just communicate with your partner, as always. You don't need to tell them about your background if you don't want to, but a simple disclaimer like \"hey I'm newer to this more narrative style of RP, please let me know if there's any bad habits I can correct/work on!\" might do. Or at least, it's what I would say.",

            "body": "Slow burns are definitely some of my favorite ones since it allows all parties involved to really explore the character. I sometimes take notes if there are large developments in the story between the characters, but it's often not always needed if it's a short-term RP partner. If it's something more long-term and they just don't bail once a session is done, I often take more notes of all the character's involved that way I have a way to 'go back' if I need a refresher. Wavemaker's a pretty good free alternative to writing software like Scrivener/Dabble and it allows you to create a database of characters, places, and you can create a mindflow for timelines, etc.  \n\n\nOther than that, just try to enjoy it!",
