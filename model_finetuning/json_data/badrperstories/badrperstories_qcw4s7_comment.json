            "body": "I think you should look for another partner, as in an *additional* partner, if you aren't sure this is a bridge you want to burn. It sounds like you really enjoyed writing with this person, and that while they don't have the time/energy/motivation to post these days, they're still communicative.\n\nI am not super familiar with the concept of designing other people's characters or commissioning art, but I don't feel the characters should be taken from her if she helped breathe life into them and has been writing them for a long time. I'll let someone else weigh in about who owns what, here, however, because it's possible I don't understand it well.\n\nIt was a choice to invest the time and money, so I hope you won't hold these things against your RP partner.\n\nBut back to my initial point: I think it would be good for you to find someone else. I also suggest making a fresh story with that person. You don't have to use a different character, but most people don't want to pick up an RP that's got three years of \"baggage\" behind it and premade, predesigned characters they'll be expected to write. (Or at least, that's my opinion/experience. I might be unaware of a subculture of RP where this isn't the case at all!)\n\nThere's no rule you can't have a current partner while your old one's on hiatus. You can have as many as you can realistically keep up with. It's always good not to be 100% reliant on just one person for your RP fix, because there's a chance it breeds bitterness and contempt when they can't provide.\n\nObviously there's a possibility your old RP partner gets pregnant and her lifestyle changes, and she never picks the story back up. It still happened; you can still reread it and reminisce and enjoy the artwork. It sucks when a story you're not finished writing ends before you were ready for it to, but it's a thing that can happen in collaborative fiction.\n\nIt's okay to remind old RP partner if you're uncomfortable with the direction conversations take. You can tell her you're happy for her and glad for her, but that you're not comfortable discussing so many \"real life\" details. It's also okay to gradually distance yourself.",

I\u2019ve always had additional RP partners as I know very well that most RPs don\u2019t last a few months, or even a few weeks!\n\nAs for the designed characters, they were originally designs I planned to sell and she wanted to use them for RP. Since I was happy about it at the time, I let her have them for use in that RP specifically. And I was really clear about that, since I did depend on selling designs for income. As for writing them, most of them haven\u2019t been introduced into the RP at all. They were briefly mentioned as being this character that does this, that helps with this, etc, but 70% of them haven\u2019t even been used yet aside from mentioning them very briefly. It\u2019s just I put over sixty hours into designing most of the characters, animating them, doing refs, etc, while she hasn\u2019t even finished a written biography for them. Nor actively uses them in the RP.\n\nI understand it was a choice, but it still really sucks that I wasted that time and money instead of using it for something else. Such as work, school, etc. and that\u2019s why I\u2019m reluctant to let go. I chose to do it because I trusted she could be honest with me concerning our RP.\n\nAs for premade characters, I don\u2019t like using written characters. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t like personally! I\u2019m fine if my partner doesn\u2019t work like that. But I feel more secure that way, and most of my characters don\u2019t really connect with each other.\n\nI don\u2019t really like revisiting old RPs. It\u2019s like picking at an old wound. It just makes me feel not RPing again. While I understand where that POV comes from, it just disheartens me to remember that any RP can fall apart. Or that\u2019s at least how I feel right now.",

It didn't happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward to now, I'm out of that MMO and using the character in several places.

I have OCs in dead/hiatused/concluded RPs that I still draw because it makes me happy and I like to draw these characters even if I'm not happy about how the roleplay ended. I have no expectations about it, other than that drawing them makes me happy. My partners also like my drawings (or at least they pretend to, lol), but that's just a bonus. Even if they didn't like my drawings, I'd still draw because it makes me happy. And if it stops making me happy, I'll stop doing it, but that doesn't retroactively invalidate that it made me happy before, or make it a waste of time.\n\nSimilarly, when commissioning art, just do it to make *you* happy. \n\nIt honestly sounds a little bit like you saw purchasing art or giving your partner art as some way to \"buy\" your partner's attention/allegiance, particularly since you seem to think that this money was \"wasted\" because the RP is winding down. I find that a little odd, honestly. People can't foresee the future, and sometimes people aren't in a space to commit to RP like they once were. It happens, and three years is honestly a longer time than most make it, so, I wouldn't see this as a failure or something malicious on the part of your partner.\n\nMy suggestion is to be honest about what you want. Your partner is not in a position to reliably post right now. So, what is it that you want? Do you want to close the roleplays? Put them on hiatus? Do you want to end things with this partner permanently, or leave the door open?

This happened around the second year mark, and hasn\u2019t returned (likely because they are busy with other things or aren\u2019t as invested as they once were), which is why I didn\u2019t want to mention it, since it wasn\u2019t part of this recent behavior. And it took me some time to sort through things emotionally and organize the pros and cons of this RP/partner. But this partner did put slight pressure on me to draw certain RPs of ours, and would make offhanded comments about the fact that I drew some characters more than others (\u201cwhy do you always draw xxx instead of yyy?\u201d or \u201clol I guess this is the first art of this RP\u201d). The art I did draw because I genuinely enjoyed the RP I won\u2019t regret because I did (or do) love that RP and those characters. \n\nAs for \u201cbuying\u201d their attention/allegiance, whenever they did make those remarks about not drawing a certain RP/character enough I did sort of feel that was the case. I would feel less let down if this person was honest about wanting a hiatus or break rather than always saying they\u2019ll reply by this date and then not meeting that deadline. I know you make your own happiness in this hobby, but after three years i would expect them to at least say \u201chey I\u2019m too busy to RP right now cause things are hectic, but I want to continue when things wind down\u201d instead of repeatedly getting my hopes up. I\u2019ve done that a few times before, and we got by okay and started up again when things calmed down. \n\nI have written up a rough draft of what I want to say concerning this, but I haven\u2019t managed to muster up the courage to. Last time I asked if a person wanted a hiatus till things calmed down on their end, I got slapped in the face (metaphorically) and called more than a few choice words.",

(I know this isn't very helpful if you're someone who has a hard time telling people no, or are worried they'll quit the RP if you don't draw what they ask, but honestly, anyone who would quit an RP if you don't give them free artwork is not a good partner in the first place.)\n\nThat said, consider the double standard you're putting forth. You're saying you haven't mustered up the courage to ask for a hiatus because of bad experiences in the past, but that you'd expect your partner of three years to be able to be honest with you about wanting a hiatus. Maybe your partner has also had bad experiences in the past, and it's making it hard for them to be brave, in the same way you're experiencing it. Self-advocacy can be hard, and it's not easier when it's the other person having to do it on their behalf.",
