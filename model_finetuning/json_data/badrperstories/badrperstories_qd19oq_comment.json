I was new to rp and didn't know I was allowed to say no, you don't control my character, I do. So I reluctantly went along and then went and asked other people about it later. Having determined that this wasn't how rp was done in that community, it was just him being a dick, I used another character to reverse the victim's inflicted memory loss, so she knew what he'd done, and the result was that things went badly for his characters IC for a while as a result of him taking OOC advantage of a newbie's ignorance.",

Maybe other characters got away with the same thing because they had other plots/interactions in play. Maybe the members are young/got excited and didn't realize OP was upset about the way things were turning out OOC. It can be easy to get caught up in the group mob.\n\nAlso: expecting all characters to be treated equally by all other characters is setting yourself up for disappointment. Yes, it is very possible another character can be treated better because of OOC popularity in the group (as another commenter has said), but that characters' rapport and relationships with the other characters can have a huge effect on how their crimes are perceived as well. \n\nThe overall attitude of the character has an effect, too. For example, that \"heroic\" character who beat up on B might intend to give his character that darker side. The group could be playing off it when they continue to see him as a paradigm of moral integrity. Taking things personally OOC when they happen to your character is generally considered a bad habit to break, because it's blurring the IC/OOC line. It's setting yourself up for agitation and hurt feelings. For others, this is just a story, so try not to let it be too personal to you even if it seems unfair. And sometimes it is unfair! In those cases, you have to know when to cut your losses and look for a group you jibe with more.",

Consequences are all well and good, but they should be agreed upon by everyone first. It's one thing for an established character to react to a thief stealing their necklace, it's another to use a random remark from the thief about something they did off-screen as an opportunity to *make up* their victim (technically an NPC that would have belonged to you) out of the blue and rally other characters against them without their permission. I would take this as a lesson to stand your ground the next time someone tries to involve you in a storyline you didn't consent to.",

            "body": "It was very hard for the RP\u2019s well-established law force to ignore the character\u2019s thievery when they walked around with the stolen necklace around their neck. And bragged about how expensive it was and how they stole it. The actual retcon wasn\u2019t called for until it was entirely too late, but it had sounded like you were pretty on-board with the character facing consequences. Even after, it had sounded like you were okay with the idea of it again. And again, the situation became impossible to mend after a certain point.\n\nThe owner of the character that did said \u201cphysical abuse\u201d admits it was not their character\u2019s best day and they shouldn\u2019t have acted like they did. It was never a personal attack on you or your characters, though. People act IC far differently than OOC, and I don\u2019t recall anyone OOC actually making fun of you. The \u201csus\u201d jokes, immature as they were, weren\u2019t aimed to bully you at all. It was just humor from the situation, I\u2019m very sorry if they were meaner than intended.\n\nYour characters were not in jail for an immense amount of time and were allowed to roam free afterwards with some shackles to prevent further thievery while they paid off their debt and a slap on the wrist. I don\u2019t think the other character\u2019s sick family was even mentioned to the law enforcer, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nThe attitude around this RP is very much \u201cactions have consequences but we are willing to work with you\u201d. I think your characters would have been out of the woods pretty quickly.\n\nYou were banned for your character\u2019s constant passing of gas and having a very odd dream where someone peed on them, not because of your characters, I believe. There may have been something else I\u2019m unaware of, but I do know those were contributing factors.\n\nI hope you can at least find a better RP group for you in the future, and you can leave this one\u2019s memories behind. Sorry it didn\u2019t work out.",
