Sometimes people lose the spark to write for awhile and need a breather and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna touch on the very skeevy thing you did to your sister but I hope you feel better soon.",

She told you that she has some things going on in her life atm &amp; you adding your problems on top of that might be too much to handle for her atm.\n\nWe don't even know you &amp; you told us about your entire life, now imagine how she is feeling. Maybe she just wanted someone to RP with, with no RL drama added, because she has enough drama going on in her own life. Some people can only take so much before they need space or another partner. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through a lot right now, but maybe also try to self reflect. Some of the problems you have atm are your own fault because you get into other people's business, when it's none of your business. Just try to stay out of other people's private life decisions &amp; give your RP partner some time. Good luck.",
