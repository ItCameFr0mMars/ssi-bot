            "body": "Is this an unpopular opinion?\n\n\"Dark themes\" is a term that is broad to the point of being non-informative if it is meant to indicate specific data/themes/plots. If someone has something specific in mind when they say 'dark themes,' they should just say what they actually mean and not be euphemistic. It's tiresome when someone says they're interested in dark themes, but what they actually mean is \"I'm interested in a very specific dark theme and we're going to play 20 questions until you figure out what it is via process of elimination because I'm too much of a coward to just say what I want.\"\n\nOn the other hand, I do think 'dark themes' is a pretty useful filtering term. I use it to signal to people not that I am interested in any *specific* content, but that, for a lot of roleplayers, what I'm interested in roleplaying is never going to be anywhere near what they're looking for in a partner, and it's best they just don't respond to my ads.",

I don't think the words dark or dark themes are banned but I'm pretty sure saying words like sexual and abuse are (along with 10,000 other stupid words, I remember someone said \"mistress\" got their post pulled and angry replies from the mod) and that means that people can't put out details. Even saying you *don't* want something sexual is likely to get your post yanked \"bEcAuSe AuToMoD dOeSn'T rEaD cOnTeXt\" and the mod is too much of a twat-waffle to approve posts that say \"I *don't* want ERP but I want a dark RP with non-sexual violence\" because you used words that are on her no-no list. \n\nWhich is I think why people start to just use euphemisms and very broad words like \"dark themes\" and then get all confused because it's such an encompassing term and no one is on the same page. It'd be a lot easier if people *could* explicitly say what they're looking for and what they're not, but the mod isn't going to turn off her automod or manually approve posts, so here we are.",

I see it as six of one and a half-dozen of the other. \n\nTo be clear, I think it's fine to use the words \"dark themes\" without being okay with *all* the things that can fall under the dark themes umbrella, but I'd expect someone requesting dark themes to be interested in entertaining the possibility of several things that can fall under dark themes, not a *specific* dark theme. If someone wants something specific, and don't state it, they're wasting the time of the people responding to them who may not be interested in that/those specific things, which I just find rude. \n\nAlternatives if someone's too shy to say what they want in a public ad:\n\n1) Advertise it on a throwaway/alt account if possible\n\n2) State in their ad that they're looking for something specific and to PM them for more details\n\n3) Seek out an ad where the other person states they're open to that specific thing, or even just respond to other ads that are open to \"dark themes\" and ask if they're interested in specific theme--at least in this case, it's the person who wants something specific taking on the work of not wanting to be forthright\n\nBeing able to communicate is an essential skill for a roleplay partner, so I just find people being coy about what they want to not be a great start tbh.",

Personally, I'm open to like... Most things. Very much most things, besides very specific kinks... Which, I mean, while I do include NSFW content, I don't engage in strict ERP where listing kinks is even necessary. But then again, maybe that's just because I come from a site that doesn't allow you to advertise those things anyway. \n\nI agree though. If you're not okay with like... Most things, best to specify as much, or let people know as soon as you hit the contact phase. Because I dabble in plenty of fuckedupary topics myself, one of my first questions whenever someone contacts me is: What topics should we avoid?",

With the first example, I would be like 'fair, that is probably something that not everyone has on their mind when they say they're fine with almost everything.' With the second example, I would wonder why you say you're fine with everything if you are not interested in the arguably most common genre of roleplaying.\n\nI get it, sometimes my characters are a little weird and not everyone wants to write against a 50 year old priest or even thinks that someone would want to write a character like that. But when I talk about what characters I want to make, the person says they like almost everything, and in the end, they micromanage every aspect, even stuff like 'I don't like men with black hair', that is just frustrating as hell.",
