            "body": "I think you have a point, but it's not always that easy. For example, I know people who would prefer not much planning and often say stuff like 'Surprise me.' Which is totally okay, I get the appeal of that. And it can work very well, with people who did include all of their triggers beforehand. But when it comes to dark themes, that can also lead to the situation that asking 'Hey, can I include (...) in my next reply?' spoils the fun for them. And I really don't want to ask every time, only to be hit with 'Jeez, of course it is. Did you miss the part where I was looking for dark themes?'\n\nAlso, what is triggering and what is not is very different from person to person. Sometimes, I write a scene that is totally harmless in my eyes, only to learn that that specific topic is very triggering for my partner. For example, one of my roleplaying partners expressed discomfort about a character of mine prefering his youngest son over the elder one, because she was in a similiar situation with her family and it made her uncomfortable. Totally understandable. Of course I changed it a little. But I think it would be weird to expect me to know of this boundary. And I think that it's a bit weird to expect that people have all potentially triggering topics on their mind all the time, because what is a sensitive topic for a person can vary a lot. Some people would find every mention of someone drinking a lot of alcohol uncomfortable because of experiences with alcoholism, while other people might just write it into a scene without thinking twice about it. \n\nIf you write with someone for a long time, you often get a feeling for what they like and dislike. So you might think 'I mentioned (abuse) all the time, they are fine with that, I already asked.' but a tiny difference in the situation suddenly makes it uncomfortable for them.\n\nI think it's not very easy to not accidently cross boundaries, but the way you handle it is the key.\n\nIn the end, I believe that communication on both sides is very important. You can't expect people to ask every time, but you can also not expect people to list everything that is important to them (especially if you like a special kind of triggering content that not everyone has listed because people simply don't have it on their mind). Both parties should tell each other what they want, the burden should not only be on one person.\n\nAnd I do think that it's okay if someone is uncomfortable. I would never want to make anyone feel bad. On the other hand, it's also okay to say: 'Hey, I get that you are uncomfortable with (topic), but it's on the list of things that I really wanted to include, so this will not work out.'",

            "body": "Yeah, sure, I just meant that some triggering topics are a bit...hard to grasp, especially if you are a person that doesn't get triggered/uncomfortable very easily. Yes, there is some stuff that everyone should get is very uncomfortable (sexual assault, and so on), but there is also some finer stuff like a character displaying signs of disordered eating, which can be super triggering/ uncomfortable for someone and not even on the mind of the other person. Or like the favoritism thing in my example, it's part of so many books I read that I never thought about how it could be a particularly sensitive topic for someone. \n\n In that case, the other person needs to inform me, because asking beforehand about any tiny detail that could potentially rub someone the wrong way would be very difficult. And my partner did, which I was grateful for. But if someone already told me 'Here are my limits, this is the stuff I don't want to have included', I will take their word for it, unless they tell me otherwise. Especially if it's not an universal potentially triggering topic like 'scenes of detailed animal abuse' or something. So I kind of agree with your point, but I would put more emphasis on communication on both sides. \n\nBecause there are also a lot of people who don't list triggers that are very important for them, and then get angry if someone includes them without knowing it, and I think that is also kind of unfair.",

            "body": "You said that 'It's very easy to not accidentally cross boundaries.' and I would disagree with that part of your post. It is easy if the boundaries are something common, or your partners clearly communicate all their boundaries. But it can get quite difficult if the stuff they feel uncomfortable with is a more unique trigger. So I would say 'It can be quite hard to not accidently cross a boundary because boundaries are very specific for each person, and not everyone knows everything that could potentially be a trigger for someone, so just asking isn't always an option.' In the end, it's more important how both of the people handle such a situation when it presents itself. Not crossing boundaries is not always possible.\n\nAnd just because you never witnessed that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I know a bunch of people that are like 'I'm fine with everything' and then, when the other person writes something they are not fine with, they are like 'Ewww, that is so disgusting, why would you include something like that?' In that case, I wouldn't put the blame on the person who didn't ask, because the person who told them they are fine with anything is equally to blame for that happening.\nAn example for this:\nA guy I knew in a forum searched for a really graphic noncon setting, something about a harem full of captured warrior women and an evil king. It was clear that it was a noncon setting from the beginning, and the description used a lot of humiliating language against the women. Definitely nothing I would write. Another girl applied, got uncomfortable in the first scene, and left again. Totally understandable. Maybe she thought she could handle it but she couldn't, or maybe she thought that it would be a bit more...tasteful than it really was. Instead of just leaving, she complained to all of her friends about that, said something like 'How could someone even search something as disgusting as that?' and other stuff, calling him a monster, disgusting and so on. Don't get me wrong, I was never a fan of this guy or his roleplays, but that made me think 'Why the hell would you apply for something like that, and than put the whole blame on the guy who clearly stated what he wanted beforehand?'",

Part of the fun of RP is not knowing how they're going to react to things I present them with. \n\nA better way to do things would be for your partner to list their boundaries outside the context of any one scene, preferably before the RP even starts. Communication isn't a one way street, after all.\n\nAlso, if I have upset someone by crossing a hard boundary, my reaction to learning about it isn't going to be to negotiate with them and try to keep the RP going. That's too pushy for my tastes. Any 'negotiation' on my part could be perceived as pushiness on theirs. I'm just going to put the RP on hold. If they want to negotiate, that's on them.

All you need to do is ASK if something is okay before you write it and present it to your partner.\n\nI've gotten triggered by roleplay content I not only signed off on, but specifically stated an interest in, because I didn't realize it was going to trigger me until *after* it had happened. It was incumbent on me to communicate that I was triggered and terminate the scene. No one involved did anything wrong. People sometimes don't know where their boundaries are (especially when they're younger or grappling with a new trauma), and that's okay, but from my own personal experience it's not actually as 'easy' to avoid as you're making it out to be. \n\nI agree that if someone doesn't know if something might trigger their partner, they must ask (assuming it's a common trigger--uncommon triggers should be disclosed by the person who has them), and that someone can change their mind about their willingness to engage with a certain topic at any point, regardless of whether it's triggering them or not (trauma doesn't need to be the gold standard, someone can also say they want to stop because they find it boring or overwhelming without it being triggering), but I'm of the opinion that, while fiction is a *much* safer space to explore triggering topics than RL, it is not completely safe, and no degree of communication beforehand can guarantee safety. Therefore, anyone roleplaying dark themes must understand there is an inherent level of risk, and, assuming their partner doesn't just blindside them with a trigger that was never discussed, or ignore their stated preferences, that risk is not the result of anyone's negligence, but rather a natural consequence of exploring sensitive topics.",

            "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Again, this shit is easy. You shouldn't be assuming everyone is OK with everything because they put the word 'dark' in their RP ad. Just ask. It's not difficult to do.  \n\n\n  \nWhereas it is not difficult to do, it seems like a needless hassle to me to go to that extent. I think properly discussing boundaries beforehand should pretty much erase the need of constantly having to ask if it's alright when something comes up. It does indeed suck out the element of surprise, as others have mentioned.   \n\n\nMost of all: I don't think the responsibility to basically guard one's partner's boundaries to that extent, lies with anyone. One should not need to ask if something is okay when their partner stated they were okay with dark themes and boundaries have properly been established beforehand. If they were not taking the responsibility to be clear about what they do and do not want, that is on them, not me.  \n\n\nIt's up to everyone themselves, to guard their own boundaries. I do agree that one may have listed something as okay, or may not have mentioned it as a boundary, but then find that once it happens/comes up in the RP, that they realize they actually do not like it. But even then, it is up to them, in that case, to bring it up, and then add it to their lists of boundaries from there on out.  \n\n\nBoundaries can sometimes not be avoided to be crossed that way, no, but by that same logic; Even when asked beforehand, and given the go-ahead, a partner may still find they can't deal once it's being executed in RP. There is no fail-safe way to avoid it. But as long as it's not done deliberately where one is choosing to cross an established boundary, I think there should be no harm, no foul, it happens. Unless not specified as a boundary, I don't think the blame lies with the person writing something that turned out to be triggered to their partner. What RPers do with it, once it happens, however, is what's important. The ability for the triggered person to mention it. And in turn, the ability for their partner to be respectful and change the narrative where need be, at that point.\n\nSo my two cents: Guard your own boundaries. They're your responsibility.  \n\n\nAlso, if, as in your case, OP, as you say...  \n\n\n&gt;No matter how specific I get with these it seems like it's never 'specific enough' for a certain kind of person.  \n\n\nThen perhaps, that certain kind of person just wasn't the type who's very respectful of boundaries, to begin with. I could be wrong, but, I personally cannot fathom how that can still happen otherwise.   \n\n\nI just don't think I'd want my RP landscape to turn into something where I need to walk on eggshells and ask for permission every time just because there are certain people like that out there.",
