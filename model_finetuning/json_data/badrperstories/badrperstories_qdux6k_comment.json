            "body": "I just kind of answered your last post on the matter but...\n\nI lean towards playing female main characters, BUT, I actually really enjoy creating plenty of male side characters. And I tend to bring in more male sides than I do female sides.   \nUnless I'm doing m//, then obviously I'll play a guy.\n\nIdk. I can't say for sure why I have the preference. I think I just prefer writing with a partner who's *playing* a male character, less so to do with what character I'm playing? Although writing a female does come a tad bit easier for me, so it's also an easier default. \\*shrug\\* Laziness on my part. I used to play males and females equally depending on my partners request, but eventually I got to the point where I just decided to lean towards playing women.",

            "body": "Most roleplayers are female, and most roleplayers prefer to play as their own gender, so that is why there are more females playing females. (Except in the world of ERP, where the gender ratio is flipped.)\n\nPeople tend to talk themselves into knots about how they don't self-insert, but the truth is that most people roleplay as a form of escapism, or wish fulfillment. Most people play a character who they want to be, at least a little bit. And a very large number of roleplays include romance subplots. It's easier for someone to self-insert in a romance playing a character of the same gender as themselves, playing opposite a character of the sex they are attracted to.\n\nAdditionally, I think a lot of people straight up lack empathy for anyone who is different from themselves. A lot of women don't understand men and a lot of men don't understand women. It's probably a good thing that people like that don't play characters of the opposite sex... you've seen the sub /r/menwritingwomen, right? The last thing I want to see is more of that shit in roleplays.\n\nAll that said, I've played males, females, and genderless characters. I feel like I can write anything easily. But I understand why someone would feel more comfortable writing within their gender, especially for a roleplay involving romance.\n\nI'm curious also, why do you gravitate toward writing males?",

I know it's not because my characters just suck, because the women do get interest and other players sometimes give me some really nice, unprompted comments about them, but the fact is, my male characters are simply 10 times more popular. \n\nI don't think that particular problem is an RP centric problem, it's just how it is. People prefer to see female characters pigeonholed into an acceptable group when it comes to their writing. You will always get thousands of questions on writing subs about 'how do I write women' as if there is simply one or two ways for a woman to be. \n\nSo, I sometimes write men because in order for me to actually become active and maybe show other players my style and perhaps garner more interest, it's the easiest way to do it.",

It just seems like most characters I think of for roleplays I end up picturing as a guy. The personalities I think just seems to bounce off better as such.\nI used to do more females years ago when I first started then I just slowly started shifting more and more towards the other until playing male characters just kinda tended to be my default. Maybe because more people tended to interact with my character if they were male? \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been trying to figure out for a bit why I lean towards it as well. Especially since, as you said, everyone tends to want to play as the gender they feel they have most in common with or somewhat wish they could be. But then I have absolutely no Interest in being a guy so I\u2019m kinda at a loss XD\n\nIt could just be as simple as me realizing more people will rp with your character if they are a guy, and it just sorta turned into a habit ;-; \nOorrrr maybe it\u2019s just fun to play around with personality tropes for guys and make it more unique.\nEither way most characters I picture nowadays are male and I have kinda a hard time making girls",

Primarily female playerbase plus hobby as a form of wish fulfillment equals huge supply of female characters.\n\nI think there's also a degree of self-segregation that's at work, though.\n\nGuys into RPing seem much more likely to gravitate toward D&amp;D and other systematized, group-oriented RPGs (particularly ones with magic and action, common components of male wish fulfillment stories). In those communities, it can be hard to find female characters.\n\nI prefer to run group RPs as a GM because I enjoy entertaining people, and I put a lot of time and energy into meeting and understanding my players so I can craft something that's uniquely suited to their tastes and deliver a (hopefully) memorable experience. It's a lot of work to put into an ephemeral performance for one person - and it's pretty thankless work. But I often struggled to bring in female characters because female players just seem less interested in group RPs.\n\nPut another way, a stereotypical female wish fulfillment storyline is unlikely to align with a stereotypical male wish fulfillment storyline, so I think it's inevitable that people seeking a particular fantasy self-segregate and cluster together.",

I'm not sure if this means there are *actually* fewer roleplayers who play men, though. They may simply be less visible.",

I've had people tell me they have no idea how I can write certain characters so easily when I'm nothing like them ooc, and that they can only write characters they're similar to.

I've never been tempted to play a female MC, and at this point, I avoid it. I have a lot of female side characters, for what it's worth.\n\nPart of me guesses that it's a bit of fantasy. I love the vulnerability of two guys being together and having soft sides. I like exploring the potential for emotional depth with characters who would be tough, dominant, and relatively brusque heroes in a M/F romance. That's what I enjoy reading about in romantic fiction (*oh my god Song of Achilles*) so it's unsurprising that I enjoy writing about it too.\n\nBut for the most part, yeah, roleplaying is about relating to a character for most people. They reflect themselves in the person that they write about, so a lot of women play women, and they often mesh a lot of their own personality traits and likes/dislikes into that character. If you keep a partner long enough and write different stories with them, you might begin to see a pattern emerging in their main characters as a result. I catch myself doing that with my characters, too, and have to constantly remind myself to diversify. It's an easy pit to slip into.",

I decided to play a male for the first time to change things up, biologically I am female. The DM said I rped being male so badly that my character was actually a female pretending to be a male. It put me off ever trying to rp a male again until relatively recently, and then it was playing a character that is canonically a cat more or less.

It is a form of escapism to me, obviously, but I don't really see myself in my viewpoint characters, buuuut...  \n\n\n... their thoughts and mental states is what I must be able to relate to and understand the most. I personally like when roleplays have multiple characters (I mean, how much story can you really write with just two characters and no more? Not much, right?), but when it comes to the viewpoint characters I often feel uncomfortable playing a male character, especially if they're conventionally masculine or even a hunk. Having a male character as my viewpoint character is not necessarily off the table, but I'll either go for the Pretty Boy trope (and I mean something akin to manga/anime rather than those pretty young boys in western live action productions.) or a male character that doesn't look it at all, as I still have a penchant for creating them, and I imagine that's not what a lot of people making F4M ads are looking for, since I personally just *don't* care that much for hunk aesthetic in general. (Though that's not to say I never make characters that are manly in the traditional sense, but it's far and few in between, and even males well into their 30s and 40s are likely to have smooth facial features, slim necks and longish hair when it comes to the characters I like creating.

            "body": "This hobby trends female. There are plenty of men who RP, yes, but I think statistically we're a vast majority of women. A lot of writers, I think, feel more connected to characters of their own gender. A lot of people say they're not comfortable writing the other gender, or don't enjoy it as much, or don't feel like the character is as authentic, etc. I've seen this conversation come up a lot on forums; those tend to be the most common responses.\n\nStrictly anecdotally, I find MxM pairings to be a lot easier to find than MxF as well, and I think that also ties back into how women in this space -- especially young women still figuring out their own sexuality -- feel safer exploring male homosexual relationships because they are an exploration of sexuality without anything touching too close to home. They can keep themselves one degree removed from it; it's safe. (I also think there is a pretty large subset of RPers who grossly fetishize male homosexual relationships, but that's a conversation for another time, and OP I would not want you to think I am criticizing you in that regard.)\n\nForum RP has definitely gotten better about it. Back in the day, there used to be required gender ratios; e.g., for every two females you wrote, you had to pick up a male character to even things out. Two factors helped pretty well erase that standard: people branching out more away from strictly romantic plots, and forum rp (especially the jcink/invisionfree sphere) becoming almost aggressively accepting of \"alternative lifestyles\". You know, there's not as much of a need for \"a guy for every girl\" if you've got a lot of MxM and FxF pairings, a lot of NB and trans characters, etc.\n\nHowever, I still find though that if you look at the request forums on most sites, you'll find a ton of female characters in search of a male for their ship, ads sitting long unanswered, whereas anyone who posts a male request for a female to ship with gets snagged real, real quick. And that corner of the RP world is definitely female-dominated, by probably an easy like 80/20 split at least.",
