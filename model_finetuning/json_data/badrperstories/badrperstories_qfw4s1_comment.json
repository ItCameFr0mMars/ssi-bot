I roleplay the main villain in one of my fandom RPs, so virtually everyone's character hates them (which is fine, it's canon!) along with some of the RPers disliking them as well. I ran into an issue where some of them just couldn't help but remind me how much they/their character hated mine every time we plotted or discussed our characters or threads at all, even when it had nothing to do with the particular thing we were talking about. It got to a point where it was upsetting because I was like... I get it. Your character hates mine for xyz reasons and you hate them in canon for abc reasons. You've told me a dozen times already. I eventually had to make a post addressing it.\n\nThe result? One of the biggest offenders messaged me something along the lines of, \"Sorry you're getting hate. I mean my character hates yours because x and he has every right to, but still, nobody should be sending you hate.\"\n\nI asked them to stop doing something and their response was to immediately do that exact thing.\n\nSorry you've had to deal with this too, it sucks.

The only person I've ever known to do this same behavior was extremely insecure and spent 99% of their time insulting other players or their characters. Sometimes I imagine what it must be like to BE that person and live in a headspace that disgustingly ugly. At least I can hit the block button and erase that negativity from my life. Not to say I feel sorry for them, just... a lingering and repulsed kind of pity, maybe.\n\n&gt;I roleplay the main villain in one of my fandom RPs, so virtually everyone's character hates them (which is fine, it's canon!) along with some of the RPers disliking them as well.\n\nThis is something I've experienced too. I never had to say anything about it, because it never got THAT bad, but I also played other characters and that particular one was only my main focus for a short amount of time.",

I'm willing to bet it has more to do with her and whatever issues she's dealing with rather than anything you're doing. I know that probably doesn't help, but try not to let her infect you with self-doubt or self-consciousness. The best vengeance is staying strong and confident in your character.\n\nHer informing you that she's going to be silent is weird af to me. Basically she's saying she has nothing positive or neutral to say, which is a great way to respond to someone who just admitted to feeling self-conscious and hurt. That's a vulnerable thing to do on your part, so she massively sucks for such a callous response.\n\nBut you're giving her too much credit your initial message to her: she *absolutely* means to be hurtful.",
