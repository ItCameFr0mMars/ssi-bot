It could be that they weren\u2019t feeling the same level of drama over the motivation for the enemies desire to hunt your protagonist OC. It doesn\u2019t really surprise me she wanted to focus on her OC a little bit because she\u2019s been playing yours all this time. You didn\u2019t mention how you ended it but it sounded like it wasn\u2019t very amicable.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s your fault or her fault or whatever, I wasn\u2019t there, and I don\u2019t know your dynamic. But it sounds like up to that point it was a story built on a lopsided focus towards characters who weren\u2019t hers.",

To her, you were a jerk for ending an enjoyable story.\n\nBut if we look at this from your side, you just ended a RP that wasn't fun anymore. Sometimes, you just have to be that sort of jerk and that's okay.\n\nWas this one of those times? Idk. Do you still have the RP?\n\nIf yes - leave it alone for a few days, even a week. Then, read. Pretend that some random strangers wrote all those posts and you're just an observer. If possible, maybe get someone else to read it.\n\nDoes one character feel more important than the other? If yes, why? What could be done to make them more equal? Was the whole dynamic simply doomed from the start to be just that of a protagonist and supporting character?\n\nI admit, I never did double-up rp. But I have to ask - what sort of character did you play for her? Is it possible that she felt like her character doesn't receive the same attention as yours?",

The fact that I had to ask her if my other OC (main OC) could be included more showed that it was one sided towards her. Her OC would get scene after scene after scene and mine would get one or two it felt. In my opinion it felt doomed from the start. It felt like she was using this rp to continue writing her fanfiction given that it was one issue with her OC after the next.",

I mean, she did listen to you once you pointed out how the RP keeps twirling around her character. Maybe she wanted to use the enemy as a shared nemesis? But with her OC hogging the attention earlier, that really wasn't a fortunate idea.\n\nShe's probably upset over the RP ending even though in her view, she fixed the problem. Maybe she'll even contact you again, maybe not. But in the end, she'll get over it. It's not the end of the world, just an RP that didn't work out.\n\nI'm not gonna tell you to feel one way or another, just please remember - you didn't do anything wrong by ending the RP.",
