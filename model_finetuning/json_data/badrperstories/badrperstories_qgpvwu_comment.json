It just spiralled but I built a whole little universe around it that just makes things feel a lot more whole when I\u2019m writing.",

With fantasy settings, that's particularly important, and so a couple of partners of mine were gracious enough to create maps of the setting, which is great since I'm not too big on geography, myself. \n\nI've also recently been creating websites for roleplays, using Google Sites. It's free and the layouts are somewhat limited, but it's still lots of fun to lay everything out in a visually pleasing manner. I tend to stick with Google Docs for my roleplays, so it's a great way to make a \"one stop shop\" and navigate through everything with ease.

            "body": "And I would love to share. She's one of my absolute favorite characters and she's so much fun to play.\n\nThis is a group roleplay and the basic premise is that a bunch of people who all come from different worlds are all thrown together and have to adventure through each world for plot reasons. There's a specific way that souls work in the roleplay, and due to the way I previously described her power, I kind of accidentally set her up for this. \n\nOn her world, there's multiple types of magical energies. There's one safe one \u2014 magic \u2014 and a bunch of extraplanar energies that manage to creep into her plane. They have some differences depending on where they originate, but as a whole, they are dangerous and corrupt everything they touch.\n\nBut they're also powerful, and that's where my character comes in, years before the RP starts. She's an archmage (at the time) and she did a whole bunch of research on this corruption for years. And she had a new idea. She didn't entirely understand what she was doing at the time, but she bound her soul to the corruption. That wasn't *quite* her original intention, but it suited her purposes just fine. She gained a sort of immortality from, essentially, becoming a physical manifestation of this extra planar energy.\n\nI hope that makes sense. She was once a human, she bound her soul to the corruption, and she became the corruption. However, she still kept the shape of her old body and looked as human as she ever had.\n\nPart of the power this granted allowed her to make more of this corruption if she consumed mass. Another part allowed her to control it and project it away from her body.\n\nIt was all well and good until after the RP starts and, in preparation for a big fight, she was experimenting. It wasn't a very moral experiment, and she did not receive informed consent, so I will spare the details. Suffice to say, there was corruption that was not in her main body and she was trying to learn a new skill with it.\n\nAnother important thing to note about this rp is that there's a metaplot going on that the PCs didn't really know about. There's two sides in a war, and the PCs are supposed to be aligned with one side.\n\nWell, my character accidentally attracted the attention of the head scientist of the enemy side, and because he's essentially a god, he could just teleport that piece of her right to his lab. He wanted to run his own experiments with this weird energy stuff.\n\nBut that part he stole was still a functioning part of her. It contained a proportional part of her soul, which is pretty difficult to destroy. Because she's magical energy and not flesh and blood, that part didn't die. She just stayed conscious with two pieces of her in separate dimensions.\n\nNeither of them really expected that. My character certainly didn't expect to be kidnapped, and the initial adjustment period had been pretty rough. \n\nBut hey, now she's friends with the enemy science god.",
