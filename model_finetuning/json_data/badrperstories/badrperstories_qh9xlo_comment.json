After I lost my old partner and had to go hunting for new ones, I felt like I'd never get my groove back. One particularly great writer ghosted me two weeks into our new roleplay, I received countless messages from people who hadn't read my posts, and after a few months, it felt like I'd never recover. It was time to take up knitting. \n\nSo... I took up knitting! And cross-stitching. And gardening. I read a bunch of books and doodled around in some writing-to-publish communities. After a few months, I felt refreshed and ready to try again. It took some hunting and a lot more failures before I stumbled upon a handful of great writers, and now roleplaying is fun again and I've made some fantastic friends along the way. \n\nGive yourself a break. :) Things aren't fun if they're stressful. And roleplaying is a hobby, which means you can return to it whenever you want! Stopping for a while doesn't mean stopping forever. People flow in and out of roleplay communities, which means that the people reading your ads right now aren't the *only* people out there. I'll message you with a couple decent sites to check out.",

When I returned to roleplaying back in August, I contacted someone whose post caught my interest, he ended up lying/slow ghosting me (I don't dislike him at all though, we had a good run) and another person ghosted me during the extremely early stages of initial planning (fair, maybe we didn't vibe) but I have two roleplay partners who I adore writing with now. One has been going on for more than 2 months which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things but we both generally write beefy responses so it feels like more, also I *love* our characters. The other has been going on for less time but we're both excited about the RP and she's seriously lovely OOC.\n\nI can understand why people become hesitant to keep going, though. It's hard to connect sometimes, writing styles might not gel and neither do the people behind the writing, but if I was to look for something myself (I never had a strict idea in mind for what I wanted to do, just general themes so maybe it was easier for me that way) I would vet people heavily. Make sure they know how to create a world with me, know what they want from their character/s, add to the plot every once and a while.\n\nI really hope you find your spark again, this hobby needs great writers still and always will.",

I got back into roleplaying right before the pandemic hit, and between that and working a night job, it was sort of the perfect combo to give me more time to write. So I went a little crazy and got into all sorts of roleplays early on, but I've noticed over the last year or so that my creativity seems to be dwindling, along with my attention span. \n\nI don't think you can discount this ongoing pandemic as a factor, creating a sense of confusion, uncertainty, and uneasiness, not to mention the feelings of isolation and a lowered social life. Even if folks may not realize it consciously, perhaps that's coming into play, and explains the lack of follow-through, propensity for \"ghosting,\" low attention span, etc.\n\nWish I had an answer for you, but for my part, I've cut *way* back, and really just focus on one storyline/partner right now. Trying to conserve my creativity for the quality roleplay I've managed to find. I suppose, of course, the trick is *finding* that in the first place.
