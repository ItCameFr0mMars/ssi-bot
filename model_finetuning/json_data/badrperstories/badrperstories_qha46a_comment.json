            "body": "If you're doing a play-by-play brawl where you can't really jump too far ahead because it would be presuming someone else's action, and things are literally moving second by second, then it doesn't need to be long, and really anything that could add bulk to the post would be internal monologue and reactions to the other person's action. And it doesn't make sense to add a lot of that.\n\nSame goes for smut, fwiw. It's hard to write lengthy fight or smut scenes because of the condensed timeline, and because it doesn't really make sense in the middle of a physical scene for characters to hit pause to wax poetic about their surroundings or spend too much time in their head. \n\nIs your partner requesting you to have longer posts? Have you asked if the length for these fight scenes can get a little lighter?\n\nGeneral ways to expand post length, should one so desire, in a time/place where it might make more sense to do so:\n\n1) Don't restate what your partner's character did, but instead respond, both internally *and* externally, if those responses are *different* from one another. (Honestly not sure why there's so much hate for internal monologue in this forum. It can be gratuitous when a character wears their emotions on their sleeve, but start writing manipulative or deceptive characters, and suddenly it's essential for characterization.)\n\n2) Expand the environment. Is the environment completely static, or has something changed? Is there something that was always there, but your character is just now noticing it? What are your character's senses communicating to them? Are they paying attention to what they should be focused on, or is something distracting them?\n\n3) Weave in context. While I don't think every post needs to be an info dump, there are some places, particularly when a character makes a choice that is unexpected, where adding context for the character's choice as part of their history/backstory can be illuminating.\n\n4) (The only requirement). Progress the story. What happens next? Give your partner something to reply to. If you're having issues in this area, some OOC planning may be in order to decide on the general trajectory for the scene.",

This roleplay in particular is a \"double-up\" roleplay of two different scenes going on, so I'm trying to keep both sides at a balanced length.
