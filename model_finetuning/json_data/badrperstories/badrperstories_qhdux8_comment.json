And c'mon, there are a fair number of bad writers in the wide world of online roleplaying. This person's skill level will be a fine match for other people.\n\nIf they ask for a reason, simply say \"our writing styles don't mesh\". If they ask for clarification, offer a bit of constructive criticism^(\\[1\\]) and wish them well. But don't shred their confidence and call them a bad writer.\n\n^(1.) The best criticism is a shit sandwich. Say something supportive, elaborate on everything you dislike, and end it with an encouraging comment. \"*I really love the characters you've created! You have a gift for creating believable backstories. It's difficult for me to get into the story when I have to paw through all those typos, though, and the repeated grammar mistakes are really distracting. I'm used to receiving longer posts that have been spell-checked. I also appreciate a broad vocabulary and a bigger focus on settings and introspection. Of course, that's just personal taste, and I'm sure that you're going to find a great partner down the road. It was nice to meet you!*\" Ta-da! A classic shit sandwich.

It would be discouraging at best for OP's writing partner to hear, \"Sorry, your writing's just not good.\" At worst, they might give up on writing altogether because they're \"not good at it.\" I don't think that's dramatic to say; a lot of people give up on new hobbies and interests if they get negative feedback about their performance.\n\n***Critique should be constructive***, and given only when it's asked for. The above comment gives an excellent example of how to kindly give pointers for improvement.  Remember that you're not obligated to expound on your reasons, too; if you don't think you can pull it off this gracefully (or just don't want to), it's perfectly fine to leave it at, \"I don't feel our writing styles are compatible.\"",
