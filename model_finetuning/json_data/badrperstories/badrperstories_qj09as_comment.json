I asked a fella the other day after 6 days of no rp and no communication if he was still interested or not just so I'd know and he called me clingy then deleted the group chat and blocked me even though it was the only time I had asked. I've had clingy rpers before FOR SURE. one guy got mad when he found out I was rping with him and 3 others. Told me I BETTER NOT be using the same character I was using with him because she was married to his character.... excuse me?

            "body": "Fun little update: They kicked me from all the rp serves we share except for the one that is public with other people in it. No word no nothing. I was attempting to talk in Genchat on the public server and they came in. I ignored them and kept talking and the moment I started talking. They vanish and go offline. When I\u2019m online? They stay permanently offline. And yet they haven\u2019t unfriended me or blocked me which tells me this is all part of their tantrum to try and bait me into asking them what\u2019s wrong/apologize/drop all my other partners and just rp with them. \n\nYeah no. \n\nThey were a shit friend anyways, narcissistic when it came to their ocs ( cause they were all self inserts so if you said anything bad about them they took it EXTREMELY personally ) and hypersexual about everything. ( and often made comments to me about certain character things that made me uncomfortable in that regard. Like constantly talking about how phalic the emojis I used look, equating anything I said to them back to sex, trying to get me to play someone else\u2019s character so he could smut rp with them because the owner of said character would not, and often making jokes at my expense like when I would put \u2018 ass he \u2018 instead of \u2018 as he \u2018 and they would immediately be like \u2018 ASS????? LOLOLOLOL!!! \u2018 like that didn\u2019t get old. )\n\nI\u2019ve found out they also been treating my friend bad and pretending that it was in my honor so lololol. \n\nI\u2019ve known this person for an entire year. I\u2019ve been there for them even when they didn\u2019t feel like being there for me. Listened to them all the time. Gave them whatever they wanted for plots and now because I\u2019m expanding and making new friends they wanna dump me? Yeah. Really shows were they stand when they would literally drop an entire year old friendship over fucking rp.",
