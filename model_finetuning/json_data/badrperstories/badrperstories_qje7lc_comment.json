People who ghost will just continue to ghost you and trust me, I know, speaking from experience. You'll just waste your time if you ever try to give them a second chance, or more. If you ever meet somebody who just unfriends you etc out of nowhere, block them to make sure you won't stumble on them again. It's the internet, where half of the people in the roleplaying community (yet not only) lack communication. I have had it happen to me recently, but they made a bullshit story to ghost me for weeks instead. I'm going to tell you that you should ask the next person you plan on rping with if it's okay if they make the starter first at the very beginning of your convo, so that you could be sure you won't waste your time. Well, they could always not respond afterwards but it's always better than just wasting the starter.",

She disappeared (we didn't have any servers or anything, as we roleplayed over google docs), but then about a year later after we had first started roleplaying, they wanted to roleplay again. They actually wanted to continue our current story. I was fine with this. I gave her another chance and there was no hard feelings. It's been another 5 months and that roleplay is going fine. Sometimes responses slow down, but she's much better at getting back to me now.\n\nAnother girl and I started a roleplay and it only got in a couple of posts. Like, 4, maybe 5? She stops responding. She doesn't delete the server though... but eventually, I decide to leave the server myself after like 3 months of silence...   \nAnd she too, a year later, contacts me again. She wants to roleplay again. I give her a chance as well. We decide to continue our old roleplay. She gives me like 2 replies. Silence. However, she actually gives me updates: \"I'll reply tomorrow!\" -&gt; Doesn't reply. -&gt; \"Tomorrow, promise!\" -&gt; Doesn't reply. Finally, after like 2 months or so, I decide to just leave the server and delete her from my discord. Something I very rarely do. I'm a patient person, but I don't wanna get another request a year from now asking to roleplay again just for it to not go anywhere lol.",
