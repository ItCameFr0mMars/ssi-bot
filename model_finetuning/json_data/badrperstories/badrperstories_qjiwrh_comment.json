At what point am I more annoyed than excited to get a response? Have I communicated that to the other person?\n\u2014How do I feel about having to \"nag\" the writer to get a response?\n\u2014Can I see myself happy continuing at this rate in the future?\n\nThese are for you to consider, initially, so you know where you stand, your values and preferences. \n\nKeep in mind this just my personal MO.\n\nI would do this self-questioning and based on what I feel is right for me, I'd communicate with the other person. In my case, I would not be happy to have to constantly ask about a response in order to get one, I would feel that the person isn't motivated on their own. Which is fine, people lose interest etc, but I would consider that story done and stop giving it time in my head. I would let the other person know in a respectful manner why I don't feel this is working for me and see what they might have to say about that. I'm not a fan of chasing or pushing people, so if they were just \"Alright I guess\" that would tell me they're not looking to change anything about what I brought up, which again is fine, but time to say goodbye. The responsibility to find out what we want and ask for it falls to us, so sorry if you were looking for a more specific direction but I think this has to be shaped by what you truly want and how cool you are with some compromises for this rp buddy of yours.\n\nSincerely,\nAR.\n\ud83c\udf1c",

I make my expectations clear in my ad and I choose to roleplay with other people who feel the same.\n\nYour partner seems to be disengaged from the roleplay. Unfortunately, when that happens it's very unlikely that the situation will change. If you really are unwilling to let go of this partner, I would suggest finding others to fill your time so at least you have *something* to occupy yourself while you wait on them. This is really a problem that has no good solution - you have to accept that the other person isn't as invested as you are, and accept that these long wait times are just how it's going to be if you continue to RP with them.",

It's not something I deliberately set out to do, the muse just comes and goes sometimes depending also on RL stuff.\n\nFWIW I've learned to communicate when I'm not feeling it, but it's hard to recognize sometimes. You fall into a sort of pit of despair where you desperately try to recapture the muse, but fail, which ends up making you feel worse. And then you feel too ashamed to contact your partner.\n\nOf course, trying to restart after a long pause is hard, for both partners. I've had mixed success with that. Sometimes it gets back on track, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nMy advice would be, try not to get too attached. It's outside of your control. Keep the door open if you like, but move on. Assume the worst, then all your surprises will be pleasant.",
