It's best to pick a media form or platform that allows you to clean-cut people that suck. \n\nIt'd be fun to find out that people's RP experience sucks without my input, but that's just a fantasy, really.

When the community would only use me for lifted content, I knew that it was pretty much dead. I've a couple of partners that left with me all the way back in May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might be, though I don't know. Among lifting content they enjoy causing drama, engaging in racism/LGBTQ+-phobias, hashtagging into big IRL movements like MeToo and the trending tags that were going on during the Syrian bombings\u2014 I just can't imagine they'd be afraid of what I've posted Reddit. It's just... Eugh. Almost anything looks better than that community. lol",
