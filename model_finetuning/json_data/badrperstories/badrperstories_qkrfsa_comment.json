Ghosters suck and it's awkward when they 'come back'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's especially awkward in the gaming side of RP where they'll ghost for weeks to months and things can change drastically depending on how the formats work. The last time that happened was quite a few years ago where my main got ghosted without any kind of word IC, I didn't have any OOCly, and he was gone for almost eight months. My character basically just kind of grieved the disappearance without saying his character was missing or dead\u2014 he was just gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy comes back immediately trying to start where we left off and I was like, \"No, there was a ton of RP that happened the whole time you were gone.\" He got pretty mad at that to which I was like, \"Dude, it's a roleplay, not a relationship. If you're that invested, my character being with another after eight months of not being here ICly or OOCly, maybe RP isn't for you.\" He later tried to break my character up with the new guy he was dating, but eventually gave up when no one paid him any kind of attention.",

He even ghosted me because I asked him if he was serious about getting upset with me over this lol.\n\nFew weeks later he wanted to continue the roleplay, wrote me in the middle of the night (he knows that I'm from Europe &amp; we have 8h time difference). I wasn't even online when he texted me. The next day he left the server &amp; deleted me from his friendslist, because I didn't reply right away.\n\nIt sucks when shit like that happens, but in the end of the day it's really their loss, not ours.

Sims isn't a bad idea, maybe I should redownload it and make sims, but it's just not as exciting as crafting a fun story or world together; but less disappointing then spending 4 days building up to an RP and then getting 2 days in for them to vanish suddenly.

I'd do some crosscanon stuff too, it's really not that hard to make some of the worlds work. Heck, with a bit of fiddling on my end, I was able to bring my content from one setting to another that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for them vanishing after the build up and two days in, yeah. That's... It makes my brain hurt when they do it in MMOs or something that's massively multiplayer and they come back like, \"Hey, our characters were together. Why are you having your character cheat on him?\" Meanwhile the person was gone for nearly eight months without a word. Had there been *something* I could work with, I'd have been way more flexible and even bringing in character development on my part. It's just... Oof. It's a mood. lol",
