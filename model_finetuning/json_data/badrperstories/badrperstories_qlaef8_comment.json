He has every right not to RP with you if you don't fit each others requirements. \n\nYou asked him to RP. You should have checked with his preferences as well, rather than slapping your preferences to him and expect him to meet them. You need to put it in the form of discussion not, \"I want you to put effort into it\", \"I want you to do this that or the other\" is honestly extremely rude as well. \n\nMaybe next time, next time you contact someone, *ask* what their style is, or politely inform them of your preferences and have a discussion. You very much were making demands, not opening up a conversation. His response was very rude, but honestly he had every right to tell you he was not interested in roleplaying with.",
