            "body": "What in the cinnamon toast fuck I just read? Okay so, one user had a really good point; it's important to take into consideration early red flag signs. And what I personally do before role playing with someone, or dming someone, is checking the post history. Right or wrong, I can see if the styles matches, if they're honest, or the stuff they're into role-play wise. Even better if they have set some ground rules, so you can be familiar with their limits and style. \nIf they have no post history, I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut always trust your gut, and never allow yourself to be swayed by the promise of a good plot. One shitty experience can take you away from good partners that would properly do that plot with you. If they boast how good they are, you can always request a sample. \nIf the partner is not outright rude enough for an instant block, then you can try out a few days or a week, see if you can take it or not.\n\nThe point of a role play is not to torture yourself. Personally for me, there should be some matched effort. You gotta be met halfway there for it to work; unless you're in a really good 'tutoring' mood or something. That's honestly up to you, and depends on your own style and patience, mood, and stuff. \n\nBut the moment they can't tell OOC and IC apart, it's time to run. Less likely you were the first one for them to act like that, and even less likely you ARE the only one they're sending inappropriate messages at that exact point. Maybe in that time-frame he just waited for you to cool down and forget, while he was doing the same thing to others, before trying again. Best you can do is not engage further. This kind of people with ulterior motives are not known to back away and mend their ways after a kind no. Bet right now he's pulling the same shit on others, just like how others have blocked him before for the same exact reason.\n\nThe point is. Protect yourself; set up boundaries and standards. Drop them like a hot potato when they start waving red flags. Don't be sad about a wasted plot, a wasted OC, or even wasted time. About the time, you tried, be thankful you did not waste more. And about plots and OCs, just salvage them. Keep them, rewrite them, give them a fresh new look, and add them to your role play portfolio. \n\nThis is my advice. Kinda long, but yeah.",
