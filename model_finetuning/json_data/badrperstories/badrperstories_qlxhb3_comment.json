The girl was playing a version of Snow White. But instead of the signature jet black hair, the character had like cherry red hair. Whatever, I guess. But, then she was just *too* perfect. Which, I mean, \"fairest of them all\" and sticking to the stereotypical portrayal of Snow White. She was just *boring*. Perfectly nice, and sweet, and no flaws inside and out. No negative reaction or responses to my character who was supposed to be more of an anti-hero, brutish role.\n\nWas just an extremely boring character that someone slapped their Sue Oc into the role of Snow White, and it just fit *too* well. Especially for what was supposed to be a gritty retelling.\n\nNot the worst offender. But, any really bad ones I've gotten must have been eaten away from my memory with time.

He also had a *super* cool eyebrow notch scar, and his tool was huge. He pushed away everyone who cared about him and repeatedly turned down attempts to interact with other characters. There was some \"my parents were mean to me\" trauma that we never quite got into.\n\nAnother was an incredibly handsome college boy who needed a boyfriend to glom onto and protect him and tell him he's pretty. The insecurities flared up at least once per day and sometimes vaulted into a full-blown crying breakdown. His reference picture was an anime character.\n\nHonestly, I'm glad I went through the stereotypical SoL tropes and Gary Sues. It drove me towards characters with physical imperfections, complex personalities, and atypical motivations. It's also the reason I steered away from modern settings and SoL roleplays.",

I think I played this character until I was 16 or so. She was everything; got turned into a vampire, had cybernetic parts, got some wings. The works. It all happened through RP, but the character design became a clusterfuck. If I were to write her again today, I'd take her back to the basics (but would keep the gist of her IRP timeline and how all her friends influenced it).\n\nThe much more recent example (I was in my early 20s, am now in early 30s) is a fella who was just awful. He was a smelly filthy rascal of a man with absolutely no redeeming qualities. I took that Mary Sue test for him and it turned out he was an anti-sue. At the time I didn't realize that was even possible, but upon reading into it... yeah, he was that. I can't believe anyone else put up with writing with me. I can't believe he got the amount of poon he did. This guy was an enormous pain in the ass to every other character and plot he touched. Would love to revamp him!",

He had the whiny personality of an edgy teen who discovered he\u2019s not allowed to play Minecraft until he finishes his homework. \n\nThis character was from a server a joined a long while ago, but I wasn\u2019t a mod and couldn\u2019t do much about her. This lady was an immortal vampire with enough powers and relationships to supreme beings to put a bas canon character to shame (looking at you, Ichigo.) half angel, half shapeshifter, born from a family made of powerful magic users of different origins, she could transform, grow wings, use fire and plant powers, and occasionally came up with new abilities. She attempted to be a motherly wise character and bitch _at the same time with the same people_. She attempt threaten to behead you, the attempt to cuddle you a scene later. The owner was confused as to why people didn\u2019t trust her.\n\nOver the course of 2-3 years, this vampire lady has traveled the whole world and become extremely wise and knowledgeable. She literally explored the whole world \u2014 every corner, no matter how distant \u2014 and every travel was extremely deep and meaningful. I somehow doubt you\u2019d have enough time, but She knew everything about every population and every culture.\n\nShe was so wise she thought brushing her teeth and keeping them clean would somehow destroy her fangs and make her look human. Yes. That was her plan to live with them, despite possessing shapeshifters powers.\n\nShe was also what I can only describe as extremist vegan vampire, who only drank deer blood and mistreated every other vampires. She suggested death penalty by vampire bite as the only morally acceptable way for a vampire to feed on people. Mind you; vampires did NOT have to kill humans in order to drink blood according to the server lore, but vampire lady was sure a vampire could kill a guy just by looking at him the wrong way. She hated vampires mingling with people so much she spent a good amount of time slut-shaming a human character who happened to be in a relationship with a vampire.\n\nHer solution to every problem was essentially weed, happy thoughts or violence, depending on her mood. The owner complained characters  didn\u2019t like her enough.",

Basically she can take on aspects of a fish, which would make her a beast mage but she listed her character as a water mage who was a fire royal... Then the bio, apart from the rampant illiteracy (I shit you not, nothing was spelled correctly in the three lines she gave), there was also nothing to explain how she was a water mage in a pure blooded fire mage lineage or how she was even a water mage when her abilities were beast magic spells.   \n\n\nI knew the concept she was shooting for. She wanted to have the royalness of being a fire royal, but she also wanted to be a mermaid basically in a server where mermaids didn't exist... And again, a teenager, not a university student. University is literally in the server name. It's been 4 years, and I still think back to her with such a \"wtf.\"",

            "body": "I had to dig into my files a bit but the only one that ever stood out in terms of what I made was an Naruto OC that got revamped like... 3 times as the show progress. I'm from the OG Naruto group, I was 14 or so when the series first dropped waaaayyyy back in the stone age and followed it all the way to Shippuden. She started as just a really stupid bad OC to ship with Itachi when I thought OOC-Akatsuki fics were all the rage.\n\nShe had blue hair, a mysterious past, ended up as a a dragon/jinchuriki thing with an inconsistent power set who tragically killed her family for reasons I don't even recall. Very emo.\n\nSecond reboot I took a bit more seriously? She ended up in a nebulous reverse harem for a bit because I wanted to crush on all the male characters that weren't the 12 year old baby ninjas, and she ended up being shuffled around with weird excuses to have encountered all the main characters at some point so she was on good terms with them all because yes.\n\nThird time around I focused solely on Itachi as a love interest and took the theme seriously. Her backstory got consolidated and while still stupid by current standards, was much less a clusterfuck and only ended up having ties to a few characters vicariously, mostly Kabuto and Sasuke because she was in the same orphanage as Kabuto for part of her childhood before being adopted and raised in the village proper. She ended up in Itachi's class and met him mind-to-mind for a bit until he excelled past her, while she lacked in the physical aspect of ninja training and was so-so in ninjutsu. Itachi graduated and she finished school at a normal pace, but ended up being a sitter for Sasuke part time while Itachi was starting his ANBU training and parents needed a babysitter because \"reasons that they weren't home that are plot related later in the show\".\n\nAkane was her name, and still is, and she was the plain Jane child that got hit with the pretty stick during puberty who was supposed to have a sweet childhood crush on Itachi that soured slightly when The Incident happened. She stayed in the village for a while until!\n\nHer real mom appeared from a distant land because Akane had been taken as a baby during an indeterminate ninja clan battle and was daughter of the leader, or something.\n\nFurther twist was after she was taken home, and thereby miserable, she realized Orochimaru was connected to the battle and that her mother and family were actually contracted to him as allies and they were using her and the other young folk in experiments. Tracks pretty well, I thought.\n\nThen she got an elemental dragon demon put in her for reasons and the Sue-ness continued a bit. She eventually found Itachi again and they shared their mutual understanding of clan massacre for the greater good and all that.\n\nNOW Akane is forever a gag between and my friends because she's no longer a Naruto OC, she's a half-deity succubus with mommy issues and painfully immortal so she can't kill herself or be killed and makes it everyone else's problem that she exists at all because they don't want her abomination self and she just doesn't give a fuck. She's more a force of personality and bad decisions than 'OP for the sake of it' because sometimes it's fun having a really strong OC you can have Kaiju smackdowns with once in a while. :)",

            "body": "I know I've had some bad ones, but I've always really tried to tone it back if I'm writing with other people. Doesn't mean I haven't made some (read as: at lot of) mistakes!  I look back at my early characters and think that if I played them again, they would need some changes. A wealthy girl with emotionally distant parents who could literally drain the powers and special abilities out of other people with a touch. She pretty fun at the time, and one of my current partners is even asking that I play her again at some point. But to pick her back up her personality would need some fixing. She was honestly kind of whiny, and very much depended on the other characters validation. To the point I think it was possible she became a little annoying for other writers. Tbh even I was annoyed with her by the end. It's not a bad character trope if you can play it well! I just couldn't play it very well. \n\nOne of the worst ones I've ever received is a story I think I've told before. (Sorry if you've seen it) I don't really hold too much against this guy because he typed like he was very young. And the server didn't have an age requirement. He didn't read anything. To the point he had the same last name as another character. But the person who writes that character is the absolute sweetest and actually found it quite fun so it was okay. He demanded that the character have 8 superpowers. For some context, the characters in this server have powers that could maybe level a building. Not an entire city city block. The stuff he wanted wasn't small either! I only remember a few but they included manipulation of fire and lava, flight, shape shifting into a massive monster, and speaking to animals. And when he was told that was too powerful he agreed to add some drawbacks... He said his character couldn't fly for a long time, only because he was young if course eventually that'd go away. And that his character got angry, and lost control. Then he started to get belligerent saying, that he couldn't be denied because now his character had drawbacks. When told that those were not enough, he told us that \"thinking of random drawbacks hurts my head.\" And how much our behavior, \"sucks for me because I really want to role play.\" (He repeated that one quite a few times which I why I think he was quite young.)\n\nIt escalated to the point that he told us we should be grateful it didn't have a shoulder Cannon *like in the anime*. The server has a rule against characters from existing media. Original only. He would not make a new character. He did not get to role-play.\n\nThat was the first and only time a potential new person got rude with anyone but the owner. Within half an hour the server was off the public list and a verification server was set up. She's a really good person and I know it really screwed with her to see a friend get talked down to.",

            "body": "I've many that I've seen/gotten. [This one was the biggest one](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/pwesb7/the_worst_endings_you_had_experienced/heizoa2/?context=3) I posted a while back, but...\n\n*There is another.*\n\nSo, storytime! This person is talking to me about similar concepts of magic systems, which is cool. I love talking about how to make them more realistic. But then she's like, \"Hey, do you want to hear about some twists about my character?\" I immediately uh-ohed in my mind because I knew what was coming.\n\nShe starts typing this huge post. I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, and then I decided to go do some ESO dailies while I waited. The post was so big that when I was in game, it caused me to lag for some reason. So after I died from that lag-spike, I stopped and looked.\n\nAPPARENTLY... The concept of her character was that she absorbed an aspect of Nyx from a dark object and had killed a bunch of people because they were trying to bring the entity out\u2014 despite it being an *aspect*. Anyway, there was another person that killed her character, but because of this thing inside her she couldn't die. This aspect was consuming people's life-force\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was also a djinn that was connected to her as an imaginary friend since childhood, both the aspect of Nyx and this djinn are connected to this tattoo on her back giving her this ability to have a heightened state of consciousness and it being extremely active, blahblahblah. Both die when she dies, but the player specifically said; \"Provided she can die\", which ngl\u2014 for someone who said she was obsessed with Critical Roll, knows that DMs reject that flat out. Meanwhile my character is just basically always struggling to survive and I'm just like, \"Really? ***REALLY***?\" Nyx was butchered, the lore on djinn was also butchered... Really, it sounded like it was ripped from Amara in Supernatural, plus a djinn.\n\nThis was also among her butchering Brujer\u00eda by whitewashing that part of the character. Looking back, I'm glad she didn't have 'the spoons'. She's also a person who basically was defending content theft, so I'm honestly glad she's out of my life. lol",
