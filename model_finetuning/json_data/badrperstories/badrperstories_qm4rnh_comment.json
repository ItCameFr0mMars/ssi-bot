I've got chronic fatigue, among other in life goings on, and I'm often online but not in a space mentally to reply. But, my partners are often aware of this so it's not like... I'm neglecting them while they're waiting. They know my posting habits, typically.\n\nI would just make sure you and your partner are on the same page with posting requirements (if you have any), or at least maybe catch on to their posting pattern. But I wouldn't take a pause too personally, even if they're online. You never know what's going on in the other person's life, even if it shows they are currently online.\n\nIf my partner breaks their usual posting pattern, I may ask if everything is alright, or try and establish communication, but that's usually only if they are very consistent with their reply schedule, and then suddenly it breaks for an extended period of time.",

            "body": "I sometimes get a nagging feeling when I see a partner is online yet he's leaving our rp hanging - \"they're having fun somewhere else, aren't they?\". Not much I can do about it though.\n\nI've also been on the other side of the fence; there was a semi-regular partner of mine whom I would leave hanging.\n\nNot because they were bad, but because they preferred paragraph-long replies and those take time and energy for me to make, so I would need to take pauses rather than playing in real time.\n\nWhat they did, was that when I was online but hadn't replied, they would greet me and try to start small talk with me, then follow it up with a \"wanna continue?\", \"wanna start our next rp?\", or the like.\n\nI don't like nudging my partners this way if I can help it, I'd rather have partners who are into me enough to continue our interaction without being reminded, but if it's my partner who wants to subtly tell me they'd like the rp continued quickly, then I guess I can do this sacrifice and speed up the reply.\n\n&gt;The issue is I get super antsy and just generally feel weird during that period where I know my partner's been online but they haven't replied yet, especially if it's been more than two days.\n\nIf it's been for two days or more, I just assume they got swamped in rl / rp requests, or they just moved on and found other stuff / people that draws their attention more.\n\nI don't feel anxiety though, I just move on as well and seek some other partner.\n\n&gt;Mostly I'm worried that they didn't like what I've written, that I said something wrong or that they're gonna ghost me. Which probably isn't logical, because people have lives and writing takes time. But still, it gets to me.\n\nI'd say that this worry is logical to some degree - the \"being ghosted\" part I mean. How many times when somebody hadn't replied for two days they eventually got back to you vs that was the last you heard of them?\n\nThis said, the latter case doesn't have to mean they were done with you - they might've been just suddenly become too busy to roleplay at all.",
