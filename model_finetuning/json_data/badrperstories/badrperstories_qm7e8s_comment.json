I just called it quits as I was sure they found other partners and didn't give a fuck about me anymore.\n\nHow weird would it be if we're talking about the same person? &gt;\\_&gt;",

They've clearly ghosted ya if they aren't saying anything.\n\nI should specify that they've done this before due to college (I think they said they go to med school?) coming back in session, I'm fine with waiting because I doubt I'd be able to roleplay while going to med school. They usually reply consistently every time break comes around. \n\nThey're honestly one of my favorite partners for this reason because I've lost motivation in the past and have also struggled while college is in session, having someone whose totally fine with waiting a week or more and vice versa for a very literate/novella roleplay is such a rarity. The problem is this pattern of sporadic replies without message can also look like ghosting so if they are actually ghosting me this time I'll never really know \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n I don't wanna let them go because they're one of two people whose writing I've vibed with. The other person I've vibed with has the patience of a saint because I've been as slow as fucking effing from burnout (I'm not gonna say how long it took because it's embarrassing), but they come back around whenever life isn't in the way. Unlike the partner I'm talking about in my original post, we usually continue talking to each other while working on replies though.",

We RPed and hit it off at some point, rarely talk but catch up a few times a year, etc.\n\nEvery so often those people reach out to me and say something like, \"I had an idea for a plot and thought of you,\" or see if I'm interested in joining a group server they're in or running. It never, ever bothers me. I don't always take them up on the offers, but it feels good when RP partners think of me!\n\nThe only way it would be annoying is if they were hitting me up whining about how we don't talk enough/don't RP enough/\\[insert guilt trippy nonsense here\\] etc. That, or if they wouldn't take no for an answer if I didn't want to do an RP, or were otherwise pushy. Reaching out every couple weeks to say hi or check in really isn't clingy.\n\nAll that said, if you are *consistently* the only one putting forth any effort to keep in contact, I'd reevaluate the friendship. You don't need to cut them off completely if you really loved writing with them, but I just wouldn't exert myself any further to keep in touch if they weren't making any attempt to match that energy.",
