            "body": "Diversify. Add RP partners, find other hobbies to occupy time while you wait for a reply, find social partners outside of RP (date or ask a co-worker out for platonic drinks or join a book club). \n\nBe honest with yourself. What does RP in general do for you, and what need/craving does this RP satisfy? With a bit of soul-searching, you can identify what you're afraid of losing. Then, it's just a matter of finding alternate sources, so if this disappears, you have others to rely on. \n\nFor me, RP is about several things: the most obvious is a creative outlet, others include social connection, companionship, building friendships, self-exploration (via adopting different characters that represent different aspects), sharing enthusiasm for a fandom with someone else, an outlet for romantic feelings (while still recovering from relationship trauma and too anxious to start dating again), interactivity, escapism, a love for hearing and telling stories, etc.\n\nWriting fanfiction helped with an outlet for creativity, expressing enthusiasm for a fandom, story-telling, romantic outlet, etc. I have a cat now, and a boyfriend, so needs for romance and companionship are not so needy at all. I have joined Meetup and Facebook groups for fandoms and attend events, so I have people to geek with. I've changed careers, so escapism is less of an intense need (less stress, less boredom to escape from in the first place). I'm doing more art, for self-exploration and creative outlet. \n\nBack to you, though. You sound insecure, like you expect people to find you, your RP, or whatever boring. I've had this insecurity before, too. At some point, you have to look at the fact that you've kept this partner for this long, as evidence that you're doing something right. No one's perfect. I'm sure, if you're trying to, you can find imperfections in your RP partner's writing, also. But it'd be difficult, right? Because you enjoy it so much, the flaws are not obvious? Now flip the mirror. I'm sure they feel the same way.",

Or if part of the allure is getting to write, then maybe try penning little solo pieces of your own. Or at least read some -- particularly if the roleplay is based around a fandom. There's probably fanfic for that very thing! You can see the other creative things folks are doing with this thing you love, and maybe find other outlets for enjoying it.\n\nI would definitely recommend seeking out other partners, too. They may not all pan out as well -- actually, most won't -- but it's still probably good to get some more experience under your belt with other writers. When I first got (back) into it near the start of the pandemic, I found a couple of amazing partners and really loved our storylines, but inevitably, they fizzled out, as these things so often do. I was really hurt and disappointed initially, but now I've come to accept that's part of the nature of it. Some things are just ephemeral, and attention spans, life circumstances, and the muse/momentum will come and go.\n\nEnjoy it while it lasts, but you might get lucky and find other amazing new storylines with other amazing new writers!

            "body": "Hey, I understand your struggle. I used to be in the same situation where I had this perfect partner that was just perfect to me. Our story was just way too captivating and too good to be true. I found myself sinking deep into this addiction because I started to simply get attached to the characters. But my situation is a bit lighter than yours because I used to get a reply per day. Eventually, he started to reply every two days, then didn't get a reply for a week - it was horrid. Even more horrid because we were talking out of character, but still no replies. 2 months ago he told me he wanted to take a break from roleplay and writing. My reaction? I expected it. It's inevitable for me to get upset, but I was \"tamed\" to not get fazed by this. I feel like eventually you will also become \"tamed\" to not care about this roleplay as much as you used to.  \n\n\nMy recommendation is to write different characters, find different roleplay partners and choose a different theme. For instance, if you went with a psychological horror theme, go for romance this time. In general, try to grow as a writer. Do not let your hobby be consumed by one person, because I kid you not, there are a lot of different roleplayers that can have the same standard as yours! Talking from a personal experience, of course hehe.\n\nBut keep in mind that roleplay should be more... scheduled. Try to talk about it with your roleplay partner out of character. Schedule specific times for discussions, roleplay sessions, and whatnot. If you keep writing 24/7, it's natural that there will be a lack of content and interest. \n\nMy last advice to you is to always keep your hopes low. One day your new roleplay partner will get disinterested or will stop roleplaying and that's OK. Try to let that sink in before you guys delve further into the story, so once that happens, you don't get completely heartbroken.   \n\n\nHappy writing :)",
