And honestly something about this whole post is giving me that vibe, not to be mean to you but I can't put my finger on it.\n\nI also hate to say it but your last complaint was about going through 100+ partners and wanting to throw in the towel, so you might want to look inward a bit.",

Most of the time it\u2019s the moments I\u2019m not really up to reply and don\u2019t want my partner to assume I\u2019m ghosting them. Also I\u2019m a writer that loves head cannons. I might be happy in a long term rp, but I\u2019m constantly getting ideas from everything and want to play it out in something that might last an hour. I find I am more invested in roleplays when I can consider the partner a friend. It makes discussing roleplay topics easier, and helps me feel comfortable when approaching more taboo topics. If it bothers you maybe those people and you just don\u2019t match or can find a compromise.",
