Your partner is fragile, doesn't give as good as he receives. Communication about it has broken down. \n\nLike, trust that your partner can put on the Big Boy pants and take it. Then deliver it with a bit of tact. If he takes it well, awesome! You can work on the issue. If he doesn't? Consider it a ripped off band-aid. You either end now, with the discomfort all at once, or you drag it out forever, draining your energy for not just this, but other RPs. And, it drops anyway from neglect. \n\nThere's only one option where you continue, and get your wants/needs met.",
