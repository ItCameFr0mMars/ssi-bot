In hindsight, it's also a prompt that we had talked about doing many, many months ago but never got around to\n\nIt's funny to think about, how many people posting their ads simply... don't exist? They're not just ghosts, they're outright people whose presentations and ideas were all completely stolen from someone else. Are they energy vampires or something?\n\n&gt;Fast forward a few weeks later, I get this immense apology letter in my inbox on my alternate account(!!!) that he somehow discovered and I decide, foolishly, to give him a second chance despite the blow to my self-confidence I'd already suffered. I know deep down we all get anxious and self-conscious when we get ghosted, and I'm no different; for a little bit, I was convinced it was me or my writing that drove him off.\n\nFor what it's worth, I also would have given the dude a second chance after a proper apology letter.\n\nBut only if I was in a good mood where I feel like getting dropped mid-story (because that's a very likely possibility) won't bother me.",
