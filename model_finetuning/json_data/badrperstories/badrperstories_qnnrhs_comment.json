            "body": "Hahaha. I've definitely noticed how weird people get about character height. Usually, it's over-accounting height in fight scenes and ignoring other factors, such as the weapons involved, the experience and ability each character has, the strategies used, etc. If not that, the weirdness comes in when you have a 'short' character. Sometimes it's stuff like the OP where they exaggerate it, but other times, if you have a character who is around 4'11-5'1 (and *usually* a girl), I guess people tend to underplay their competence levels in general, as well as bring it up unsolicited both IC and OOC in a way that's 'oh, short person is hilarious, they can't do much.' Hilariously, this can even happen when a character is 'average height'. Conversely, I've also seen people make 6'5+ foot tall people for no other apparent reason than 'tall=strong', or because I guess tall stands out more?  \n\nAnother time, I wrote a 4'11 high school student with a lean, athletic build (she was on the track team as a sprinter! Also did rollerblading and parkour casually in her spare time!). The moderator critiqued her profile for approval, among other things that fall under 'critique horror stories', made a big deal about how 'seriously petite' she was and made me add extra details about her height. Due to the setting involving fight scenes, I had already listed her height as both an advantage and a disadvantage (she'd have some trouble with bigger people, obviously, but being smaller helps with finding hiding spots and can even be used strategically with the big people!), plus the fact that she was a little self-conscious about it. But the mod wanted me to add stuff to her bio like 'how does she shop for clothes if she's so tiny? Does she have them hemmed? Shorter people have problems with pants!\" It was a lot of unnecessary stuff the mod wanted to me to add, as that's *one example*, but that's what's most relevant.\n\nI dunno. People are freaking weirdos about height sometimes.",

            "body": "And like, even if you don't take into account dwarfism, people- gasp- come in all shapes and sizes naturally! Like, I'm short (5'2) and overweight, and it affects my ability to get new duds, yeah. But like, there's various shops where I can buy plus-sized clothes meant for people of my size and body shape. Not to mention learning how to quickly tailor stuff is a thing; just get something a size or two bigger, then adjust it to your shape. But like, even someone with my body shape wouldn't need the in-and-outs of how I shop and live my life, because it's, again, unnecessary. You just know that if she had been a 'normal'/'average' size, this wouldn't have been a question. Admittedly, it *would* have been fun to do a 'shopping for clothes' thread/plotline with this character, since she's also a butch/tomboy type, but like, that's something to play around with in the RP proper, not something thrown in a bio casually. (I may be using her again soon, so maybe something to keep in mind?)\n\nIt didn't help that there were other forms of weirdness and nitpickiness throughout that critique, too. Stuff like 'I don't see how they \\[adoptive lesbian parents of character\\] are eccentric, so you should elaborate more. Are you saying that because they're lesbians?\" (one of them owned a quirky cafe and both of them were understanding of my character's own quirks. Hilariously, not only was my character and her moms not straight, *but I am also not straight*, and I *think* the mod was?). Also 'she's a procrastinator? She sounds lazy, how?' (she's a forgetful adrenaline junkie, not a lazy person, as evidenced by the fact that she was an *accomplished* student-athlete with decent grades and a part-time job otherwise. Not to mention that neurodiverse people are a thing; my character wasn't intended as such, but I am OOC.) I also remember a weird vibe of 'treating someone who was a bit of a mischievous troublemaker as a kid who evened out to become an energetic athlete with a few class clown traits on par with a full-on troubled juvenile delinquent who *must* be disciplined.' I'll leave it here for now, and it's getting lengthy. Perhaps I'll make it its own post someday. I'll end it on the scariest part for me: this person was pretty open about their IRL job, which happened to be... a middle school teacher. *Let that sink in.*\n\nI think, if anything, stuff like this illustrates a widespread problem in RP: people need to be more aware of issues like racism, sexism, body positivity, ableism, etc., and how that might affect people's involvement in the RP. I don't expect everyone (both mods and regular muns) to be wokey-woke all the time, because that's difficult at best given different values on what's 'progressive', but I do think people need to understand that people may want to write characters with different backgrounds, character designs, personality traits, ability levels, etc. and to be mindful that getting all 'short people??? How odd!' does have an impact on people's enjoyment. I know it did with this character: after she was *finally* able to use her it took me a while to actually like RPing as her because the critique took a lot out of me. She's one of my favorite OCs now, though!",
