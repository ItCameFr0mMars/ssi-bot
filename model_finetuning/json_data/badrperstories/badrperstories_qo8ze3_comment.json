I\u2019m wary of too extremes: \u201cthe woe is me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m literally a writing god, please lick my boots and I may grace you with my presence.\u201d\n\nWhen an ad focuses mainly on how bad everyone was to the writer and the plot feels like an afterthought, I always get a bit wary. Not only it feels someone is trying to get me to write with them out of pity (which isn\u2019t exactly appealing), but the facf they\u2019re so quick to dismiss everyone is suspicious. I get the feeling that if the plot won\u2019t go well, I\u2019ll also be tagged as a \u201cmean bully\u201d. \n\nAs for the opposite\u2026 where do I begin. Some writers makes asking for a RP feel like applying for a job. Confidence is sexy, yes, but arrogance is a big turn off. Their rules are usually condescending, making it clear they think you won\u2019t be as good at them. I\u2019ve seen people with absurd requirements and restrictions, often with the threat they\u2019ll leave or block you. (The best one I\u2019ve found: \u201cif you you do not change the plot/characters after I ask, I will block you.\u201d and \u201cI reserve the right to leave at anytime if you fail to impress me.) People who want _you_ to make an effort and impress them, while they sit on their throne and get excited at the prospect of correcting you and proving their superiority.\n\nAnother one, I guess, is people who ask for partners with \u201cno limits\u201d but refuse to reveal _anything_ about the plot. What limits are we talking about? Violence? Kinks? Both? We may never know! Bonus points if they make fun of people who aren\u2019t comfortable writing literally everything.",

If it's the main genre someone's interested in, my expectation is that it's going to smother everything else and hog the spotlight.\n\nPorn brainrot: Y'know those people who spend too much time in adult chatrooms and forget how to talk normal? Ex: People who bring up fetishes or use sexual terminology in SFW conversations unprompted. These people say the most vile, repulsive shit and they're typically completely oblivious to how horrific their behavior is.\n\nMisanthropy. As in, people who act weird about people playing humans. In my experience this attitude hints at using a character's species as a crutch for creativity, which is a wide miss for me. And also I'm not comfortable playing furry characters. It causes me a very mild amount of body dysphoria trying to imagine myself as them and while it's nothing serious, it's nothing I want to put up with all the time while I'm trying to have fun either.\n\nYou wouldn't think this would be a problem, but in my experience it sure does come up sometimes yay current year: Weird political shit that indicates someone is a nazi/nazi-adjacent or even just dubiously in the general area of such.",

I've said that in the past simply because I don't want to see rant after rant about this or that. Especially if it is getting in the way of writing.

These people are most likely to ghost in my experience and just tiring to work with. Roleplaying is a collaborative effort, why don\u2019t people get that?\n\n2.) Spamming you with pings and messages if you don\u2019t respond to them right away. This is incredibly rude and annoying because a lot of us have lives outside of RPing. It also comes off as needy and desperate. \n\n3.) Getting too flirty OOC and asking unsolicited sexual questions or asking about my relationship status. It blurs the lines between IC and OOC which is a big no-no. I roleplay to write stories, not to date!\n\n4.) Ignoring ads or not reading them properly. These people tend to be low-effort writers who are looking for one-liner ERPs most of the time. I also suspect that a lot of the people who do this are underaged too.",
