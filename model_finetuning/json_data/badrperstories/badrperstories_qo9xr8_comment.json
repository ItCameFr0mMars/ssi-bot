But that's honestly not a deal breaker and context is everything.\n\nThings involving children *can* be alluded to, but I would prefer not in graphic detail.\n\nSome hyper gore is tough for me to write out, and I've even had a scene where my partner was describing someone being partially skinned that I HAD to stop and re-read later bc it was a bit much. But, not a deal breaker. It was a good scene. Just hard to read in one sitting. I've had to write a scene of someone getting an eye pulled out, but I decided to do a good ol' fade to black for that because it was tough to write out.\n\nI've had a few moments where I was personally uncomfortable with a scenes on an emotional level, but they were hyper specific in nature. But, basically for me, I'm okay with things getting dark. But I need cushion. If the roleplay is nothing but misery porn, I NEED a breather. I need moments of elevating tension, or cool down moments.\n\nAlso, no brainer but things like character death, or things that will drastically change the story need to be discussed before hand.

            "body": "I'm usually someone who loves dark RP scenarios, and all sorts of things aren't off-limits to me. Want to kill someone in a weird and/or horrifying way in a group RP? I'm someone to ask, as perpetrator, victim, and witness alike! Want to beat someone up so badly they have lasting injuries like broken bones? Sure, I'll go for it! I think my main no-goes are:\n\n* Things like sexual violence, extreme gore, and torture *only* used for shock value: when people hear the words 'dark rp' they usually think 'oh wow, so you must be okay with depictions of sexual abuse!' Nope. Don't get me wrong, I'd be up for, say, a graphic torture scene as long as there's an actual *point* to it. I can definitely see the appeal in having a character survive torture, as an example, as one of my main interests as an RPer is character psychology, meaning writing someone who was tortured-- especially the psychological aftermath-- would be of legit fascination to me. It's just frustrating whenever people pitch and/or RP this stuff and only use it for 'gore gore rape torture gore' when there's *so much* you can do with that character-wise. It's especially bad when it feels like it's a vehicle for the mun's... *other* interests, if you know what I'm saying. So, I tend to be extremely wary of premises like these, even though with the right person my interest would be piqued.\n* Graphic depictions of bigotry, especially real-world: Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with like, minor douchery about stuff like race, gender, sexuality, ability, and so on, as long as it's not the *primary* focus and the mun is aware the character is being questionable. I get that sometimes, characters wouldn't have the most 'PC' viewpoints or understanding of certain issues. It's one thing to have a character who occasionally gets weird about, say, a transgender person they're acquainted with. It's another to want to roleplay out graphic scenes of hate crimes and discrimination, which unfortunately I've gotten pitches for. Stuff like, as I've said recently on this subreddit, 'hey can my Neo-Nazi bully your Jewish girl for no reason other than she's Jewish?' Aside from the immediately obvious, I honestly don't understand the appeal of RPing out a scene of extreme bigotry, from *any* perspective.\n* Generally, anything with an undertone of 'I want my character to be a scary villain/tragic and sympathetic, and your character is a side-role in helping my char come off as such!': Let's face it, if the mun just wants to come off as evil, or tragic, or badass, and they awkwardly try to do so without taking into account what *I* want? Nope. RPing should be a two-way street, after all, and if you want dark things to happen to your character, or your character to do dark things, you should also be able to work with the people who'll get you there and not make it 'The My Character Show, starring Me.' If the mun's pushy, or not accommodating, or generally a butthole, it's a no-go.",

That or you have a weak fortitude and find yourself too easily influenced by things. Coming from someone who has depicted villains as actual villains and wars as actual wars, I still open the door for old ladies and return my grocery cart after shopping.

            "body": "Gonna say my piece here, but this lead into a bit a vent piece and a minor horror story of mine:\n\nFor my rps, we always have people state their triggers so we can add them to our wall of topics that need to be spoiler tagged and trigger warned. In particular, things like sexual assault, pedophilia, incest, and suicide are going to automatically get tagged, though we\u2019ve had people ask to tag things like animal abuse or intense gore.\n\nNormally, though, I find that gore isn\u2019t so much a problem for people, especially cause a lot of the rps I\u2019m a part of end up with some level of gore (action rps, killing/death game rps, etc). Normally I can rp gore out in it\u2019s entirety without having to censor anything.\n\nWhen it comes to anything related to sex, it\u2019s faded to black and taken to DMs. There might be minors present, we aren\u2019t going to do that in public. And naturally we aren\u2019t going to use any character under the age of 18 for that, but almost all the rps I\u2019m in use college aged characters and up, so that\u2019s rarely an issue.\n\nAnd if that sexual encounter has even the slightest hint that it might not be consensual, it\u2019s not getting roleplayed at all. We can lead up to it and acknowledge that it happened, and we can discuss some level of the details outside of rp to get a grasp of exactly what happened, but that is the absolutely end of that interaction. I\u2019ve only had one rp that lead to something like this. It was recent, it was with a friend I trusted, and it happened as a result of this sort of natural progression between the relationship of one of my characters, one of their characters, and the main villain character of the rp. It was entirely unplanned, but we had each other\u2019s permission once we realized this was kinda where the interaction would be headed, and we made sure to ask if anybody would be uncomfortable with the topic if we moved forward with it.\nFor context, it was their character who had this unhealthy crush on this villain character. Saw that person as a person who could just sweep them away and save them from all their problems.\nMy character, whom is a person who has terrible self worth issues and is desperately trying to use his friendship with this villain character to try and push away his friends because he doesn\u2019t believe they should want to like him. He acknowledges this villain character isn\u2019t the greatest person and that he doesn\u2019t even see them as friends. Just a means to an end. He also is sort of trying to use that relationship to make my friend\u2019s character less interested in the villain, though it ultimately just ends up backfiring.\nThen the villain, who\u2019s well aware this is backfiring and is using that to keep their character involved with him, all while using my character to get the information he needs to get more powerful. This character being sexually abusive was not initially planned, though it was established that he has a weird relationship with women where he mostly sees them as tools for pleasure.\nWe ended up in a position where both of our characters were now living with this villain, essentially homeless otherwise, relying on him for food, housing, and even work to some extent. My character was already in a position of homelessness and their character had to find new housing because their roommate was working with a smaller arch villain and might have ended up bringing harm upon them.\nThis villain had them in a position where one of them desperately wanted him and the other one would go along with what he said as long as it meant not leaving the first one alone with him, leading directly into this fade to black interaction.\nWe\u2019d have them stuck in this abusive household for a while until one of their friends found out and just absolutely refused to let them go back. They had their internal struggles for a while, but eventually would be able to grow and move past that, both together and as individuals. This event would largely shape the direction of the plot along with the direction of several characters, even outside of those involved.\n\nGenerally my comfort line is drawn when my partner for the interaction suddenly feels like they\u2019re getting an uncomfortable level of satisfaction out of doing it.\n\nIn the same rp, not long after that interaction, somebody set up for something related to sexually assault. It was their character who was assaulted at a young age by their other character now remeeting and having to face this individual. And I don\u2019t know what it was about how it was written, but it felt like the roleplayer was just way too into what they were writing.\n\nThis is a persona rp, so they figure out the words to this person\u2019s palace, the manifestation of their corrupt desires, and they describe it as looking kind of like Disney Land where this person is the king of the Disney castle. You know, a place that would bring in a lot of children. This would lead into a lot of detailed talk about how this person has sex slaves and mind breaks people so that \u2018they didn\u2019t enjoy it before, but now they do!\u2019 And\nWe didn\u2019t approve of this as admins\nThey just did it without permission\nWe don\u2019t know this person outside of this rp\nSometimes roleplayed with themself at points to progress their self produced plot.\nSince it was mostly centered about their characters and an antagonist that only effects their characters, it largely didn\u2019t effect many of the others in the rp. Especially cause she chose to keep it a secret from the majority of the group and really only ended up telling one character.\nAnd they went on to stay they specifically made this character to try and one up our main villain.\n\nJust everything about that rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nNormally with stuff like that, I\u2019m pretty forgiving. I was a young roleplayer before, using dark content to fulfill my edgy writing desires. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for 8 years now, so I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve moved past that point and can handle these topics with a level of nuance and self awareness, but I\u2019m aware some roleplayers aren\u2019t and they\u2019re going to think they\u2019re making the sickest thing ever by just shoving a bunch of dark topics into one character.\nBut this person is also older than me by quite a margin. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been roleplaying for longer, but they\u2019re a proper adult at this point, which just makes it even more uncomfortable.",
