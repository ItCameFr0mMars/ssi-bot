Avoiding the subject, refusing to discuss the story, and hiding their activity is suspicious behaviour. Approach it calmly, give them space to think about what you've asked, and establish what *you* feel comfortable compromising on and what you don't.\n\nWould they be allowed to continue roleplaying if there's no erotic aspect to it? Would they be willing to share their roleplay posts with you if it's allowed to continue? Or would you only feel comfortable with no roleplaying? All of those are a-ok and not unreasonable in the least. You're not being negative, you're being honest, and that's necessary in a healthy relationship.",

Just br calm and mature and stand your ground. Hopefully you guys can find a common ground and if not then you might want to reevaluate the relationship as a whole ( which I hope that never comes to ). Though it is very weird that he wont show you his role plays? Perhaps due to just being uncomfortable or shy about his partners knowing about his roleplays due to being made fun of in the past but still very suspicious.

The relationship would not work. But that doesn't mean it's unreasonable of me to feel that way, or that it's wrong of my partner to want to continue with their hobby. \n\nThere isn't a *chance* that OP's partner might engage with some erotically. They *already are*, and there are red flags that they're attempting to hide this practice. Being uncomfortable with future roleplays isn't unreasonable in the least.",
