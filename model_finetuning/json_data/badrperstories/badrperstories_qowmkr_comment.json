Minor annoyance, but not overly impactful. They're probably heading out anyway, regardless of who says it. If it were me, I would've said something to the effect of, \"He held the door open and waited for \\[partner\\] to go first\" or \"He led the way out of the bar...\", still leaving it up to the partner to fill in how they'd like.\n\n&gt;He noticed \\[partner\\] seemed to be walking toward a sleek car.\n\nThis is the real issue here. There are a *lot* of other things your partner may have wanted to say or do before heading to that car, or they might've wanted to describe the car themselves, or any number of things. You shouldn't tell your partner about *their* character.\n\nTo put it simply, god-modding is just controlling another person's character. Small assumptions to move things along like both characters heading out of the bar isn't such a big deal, but straight up telling your partner what their character is doing when it should really be their choice is frustrating.",

            "body": "This comes down to personal preference. I wouldn't like this, personally. I don't want to be told my character gave someone a look, or have someone decide what car my character drives.\n\nThere are some forms of god-modding I'll accept, but it's contextual.\n\nFor example, I wrote a scene once where a character performed a surgical procedure on mine while my character was conscious. I didn't particularly mind that, in a scene where we'd pre-established this was going to happen, these things happened. I also don't really mind \"he grabbed her arm\" or these sort of very...*physical* acts about the relationship of one character to another. Fight scenes are different, but I'd prefer to plan those OOC in advance of submitting the post, anyway.\n\nWhat I *would have minded* in the medical scene, for example, was being told what my character thought/felt about what was happening, or if they'd written something like, \"she wouldn't have a scar,\" because there's no need for them to decide those things in order to move the scene forward, at that point it just becomes control for its own sake.\n\nEven if I allow a partner to write actions their character performs on mine without needing permission for every time their character successfully touches mine, I do not want my partner deciding 1) how my character thinks/feels about a situation (e.g., deciding their character gave yours a look) or 2) details about my character (e.g., what type of car they drive. Even though you wrote 'seemed,' it would still annoy me.) \n\nIt's...subtle, but I think it's important.\n\nThat said, TL;DR: controlling other players' characters is usually considered a no-go in RP circles, and if you prefer a different way of approaching the subject, you'll want to discuss it with your partner. It's not 'wrong' to be okay with god-modding, but it needs to be a situation where both players are clear on what that entails.",

            "body": "I don't know why you're getting the downvotes. Doesn't seem quite fair, because you genuinely seem to want to learn the \"etiquette\" even if it seems a little silly at times.\n\nBut it's one of those \"roleplay\" vs \"writing\" sorts of things. Obviously, when you write (solo stuff), you control everyone's actions, and there's no need to spend a paragraph on someone walking out to their car, like you mentioned in your initial post.\n\nBut roleplay is a different beast, and folks can get very particular about their characters. No one likes having their character's actions or thoughts \"dictated\" to them, and sometimes even *your* *character's* perception of those actions can seem like crossing a line. It's a delicate balance.\n\nWhen you build up trust with a partner, I think some of those rules can ease up. I'm lucky enough to have enjoyed a couple of long-term (over a year) partnerships with folks, where we'd trust each other enough to move/manhandle characters about, wing it through fight scenes, sometimes even switch off on controlling secondary characters/NPCs. I even had one partner where we'd try telling a scene through only one character's POV, but they'd still operate their own characters -- just through the lens of what he perceived. \n\nBut that trust is necessary, and it can take a little time to get there. As always, communication is key, so if your partner thinks you've crossed a line, discuss it with them. Or if you want to 'move things along' you can always broach the idea and say, hey, is it cool if I summarize this 'leaving the bar' bit so we can jump ahead? As long as you give them a heads up and talk things out, you should be fine.\n\nOr, y'know, try writing your own stuff, too, if you get frustrated with the endless back-and-forth of roleplay.\n\nEither way, good luck!",
