I don't think this is an unreasonable one.\n\nIf you don't want to drop the RP, you can either take some of the suggestions here about reminding them not to do it, or...\n\nTell them to *ask* you if it's okay before they do it. \n\nSometimes my partners will send me a DM like, \"hey, is it okay if we change scenes in this post,\" etc., and I recognize they may have reasons to want to move things along without writing an entire transition post for the sake of formality. Personally, my issue with a partner just dragging my character to a new scene without clearing it with me first isn't the scene change itself, so much as the lack of communication/agency.",

            "body": "Even in playing the devil's advocate here, controlling another person's character should only ever be a rare occurrence for narrative purpose that is agreed upon. Normality is the writer having full creative agency of their character. As one who had inserted others into my own custom worlds, I've never needed to control actions of another person's character ( assuming I have full environmental control and a plethora of actors why would I *need* to control my partner's character? ) \n\nRoleplay enjoyment should be 100% mutual, informing them again despite it seeming excessive is really the only healthy way. Going on despite this will probably only drain both your creative and enjoyment further, making it harder and harder to salvage.\n\nIf they have to do 'shorter' posts, then tell them to do it. Especially in GMing a lot of the posts from those controlling the world will be dynamic due to the context. If anything, they need to learn not to trap themselves into a corner where their only option is to use your character to give *their world* life. Which again, should never be nessecary to create a enjoyable and enticing post. Just be clear saying something like, \"I know I we addressed this already but not having agency over my character's actions is really bringing me a bit down in my enjoyment. I'd prefer shorting the posts if you have to or maybe we can find another solution?\"",
