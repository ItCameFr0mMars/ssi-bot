            "body": "I don't know that it can make you depressed. That's not really how depression works, but it can exacerbate your symptoms of depression which I'm guessing is what you meant.   \n\n\nYou're not wrong that there's a lot of toxicity in the RP community, but maybe there's more to it than just what you're saying here? Like, I generally feel like it's impossible to find a roleplayer who doesn't have depression, anxiety, or BPD. We're all using our stories as a form of escapism, which means we all have something to escape from.   \n\n\nIn knowing that, you can know that a lot of what you might feel is bullying because you're on the outside, they're in their little bubble probably feeling awkward as hell and not knowing how to effectively communicate which then makes them feel like they're being bullied by you. I cannot tell you how many times I've gone down this spiraling hole where I am convinced that everyone hates me and they're all out to get me, and then I stumble into a conversation with them where they're like \"what? we thought you hated us\" and they were feeling the same things I was feeling.   \n\n\nI have to think that toxicity generally comes from a place malicious intention. While the vast majority of roleplayers I know are all just as lonely and insecure as I am. We're all just getting our wires crossed because we all have different ways we communicate, but we're all trying our best and wondering why it feels like we're not connecting right. And yeah, if you put all of us into a room together, that room's going to be a toxic place until people stop talking and start actually listening. That's just a human thing though and I wouldn't put that blame on the specific individuals because everyone I know is just trying their best. Sometimes failing. Shit, often failing. But we try.",

Some people are gross or annoying, but nothing I can't fix with a good ol' block button. \n\nI think part of this is not partaking in fandom roleplay, since fandom is a space I would largely describe as toxic, and I imagine that this carries over into fandom roleplay spaces.

And I think another part is that I've gone through most of the bullshit and have learned to avoid it/not tolerate it the moment it starts up.\n\nThat said, if roleplay is not a rewarding experience for you, I would recommend either leaving or taking a break.

I left SWTOR Tumblr because people were spreading rumors about me based on things my ex was saying/doing. But then, I wasn't an angel either. I needed to work on personal boundaries. I should have let more people go earlier. I cared too much about being liked for my writing. I focused too much on negative elements, and let my depression get me. The depression kept me from regularly updating the positive people, so they became distant. I overshared with the positive people, so they became tired of me. It becomes easy to believe rumors when the rumor-target is someone you're annoyed with due to lack of updates and oversharing. \n\nThese days, I keep myself to myself. I keep OOC pleasant. I have a therapist for my depression and for emotion dumping. I still don't update quickly, but I cut off people who demand more than I'm capable of giving.",

            "body": "I\u2019d say, within my roleplay community, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of shifts in toxicity over the years.\nI know it depends a lot on where you Roleplay. First place I used to rp in was a hell site. So many bad stories from there that were just deeply emotionally troubling at points. But eventually I moved entirely to discord and the experience on there has been a lot more pleasant. Horror stories shifted from people wishing violent crimes upon me for romancing a character they liked in rp to somebody just not roleplaying at all and only hanging around for chat or using a character that felt very self insert.\nIt depends a lot on who you rp with. I have a friend group that I rp with personally and I only rp if these people are there. We always admin the groups, we make the stories together, and we invite strangers in. Being admin really helps moderate things and set boundaries on what is and isn\u2019t acceptable in our group rps. Having a friend group around helps for when somebody\u2019s bothering you and you have to vent.\nI tend to rp either original stuff or fandom rps that only use original characters in a setting that\u2019s entirely AU from canon. I\u2019d say I\u2019ve seen about equal problems split between these both in and out of rp, but it feels like it\u2019s easier to find people and make friends with people for rps tied to a fandom to some extent.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you should probably switch up your community.",
