It was on Tumblr in 2013-2014, and this was probably due to the series being a handful of years old by that point but the RP community for the fandom was nearly nonexistent-- I think I found maybe a dozen roleplayers total that were up to RPing any of the characters. And unfortunately most of them just... didn't write very well, or only did one-liners. Others would only RP extremely AU versions of characters and wouldn't write anything within the canon story. I did try to RP with some of them, but it just didn't work for me.",

Which isn't an issue in itself, but it quickly becomes one when I'm sitting here watching another adult write how their character runs crying into the distance with other characters meant to drop everything and run after them.\n\nThough, recently I have had a lot of people ask and want to play with the darker aspects of the story and try to play around more with their characters. So, I hope I'm not jinxing myself but I think Fruits Basket is really on the up.\n\nHarry Potter can be touch and go and over the passed few years I've run into more bad than good.\n\nTwilight, people have become increasingly annoying about this one.\n\nI do a lot of fandom role plays and I usually have good luck. The more popular fandoms I have to weed through a lot more to find really awesome partners. But I think I generally have a lot of luck and nothing has really run me away from them as of yet.

It's toxic to keep pushing it if you aren't into it and it's simply bad writing if the characters are building to it and they are demanding it happen at that very moment. Also bad partnership to not go over that with a writing partner before addressing it/not addressing it if it's been decided its not happening.\n\nSecondly, yes. And it's annoying af. I have actually started adding to my searches for this that whereas I am fine with intimate or adult situations should they make sense and are discussed first, they won't be taking the main stage as there is sooo much else going on. And if they're trapped in a building with walkers at every wall, it makes no damn sense for there to be any intimacy as they'd be trying to -- you know -- survive.\n\nI also hate the godmode that comes with any fandom with action in it. I can get behind a super survivor character, I can't behind a character that is never in any danger, is constantly saving everyone or just walks around punching out hoards of walkers. One of the most interesting things me about The Walking Dead is the fact that it isn't just about being a badass survivor and it bums me out when people ignore that aspect so heavily. It's also boring when they do. Especially when it comes to the games which honestly feels more like a story about the humans than the walkers as you spend an insane amount of time without walkers being an issue at all and you're focused on the humans who remain and how they are dealing with the quickly changing world around them.\n\nIt doubley sucks because I so seldom find writers who have played the games so finding shitty partners stings a bit more, haha.",
