            "body": "I think it depends on how outlandish and how well it fits the rp itself. A backstory about your character fighting dragons with a magic sword would work fine in a LOTR style setting, but not so much a real life setting. If you're joining a group, you could look at existing backstories to see if yours is drastically different. \n\nPersonally, I like to keep my characters' backstories on the simplified side. A mention of the major things that have happened, and then details can be filled in through rp. Some of them have had some pretty crazy shit happen to them, but it makes sense in the context of the bigger story, at least to me. \n\nIf you feel like their backstory isn't making sense, why? Does it feel like they had no reason to do what they did? Like it's crammed full of so many details that the important things are going unnoticed? Or that it's hard to figure out how the events are connected?",

            "body": "It depends on the roleplay, how that backstory is revealed, and why it's important. \n\nIf the backstory is just going to be vomited into the first two posts, don't craft it into anything really complex. It's overwhelming, and too many tragic details turn a good MC into a pathetic attention-grabber. Like you said, the character might be rejected from the beginning if a huge story is spewed into an introduction.\n\nBut if the backstory is going to be carefully revealed over a long period of time, complexity is fine, IMO. There's time to go into detail along the way. The tragic life events aren't all rolled into a smack-you-in-the-face snowball of emotion. \n\nAnd why is that background important? What does it add to your character? Is it an explanation for why they have certain positive and negative character traits, and why they respond a certain way to specific situations? Does it invent a problem that needs fixing? Does it contribute to the plot? Will it tighten the relationship between MCs or create a problem that needs to be overcome? Don't just invent something because it sounds cool.\n\nBackstories are great if they're done the right way. They can add *so* much to a character! Never shy away from a good backstory. But there's no shame in a character who picks up their story along the way, so don't be afraid to use those too. I mean, Bilbo Baggins was a simple Hobbit before his adventure, and he ended up turning into a fantasy badass. :) Figure out what works for you and what fits your roleplay best.",

            "body": "This is actually a difficult question to answer. There is a lot of variables to consider in making a good backstory, most of it having to do with the implied setting, theme, and general tone. The objective, of course, is to make it interesting and believable. The purpose of life events should never be about making a character look cool ( only ever as a side effect if anything ) but to add validity or reason for who they are at the 'start' of an RP and why they feel or act they way they do. \n\nOutlandish can work if the purpose is to demonstrate and explain certain aspects you would believe would be fun for others to engage in. Bad outlandish would be a story only meant to inflate a character's importance over other writer's characters ( assuming the character's intent is to have square footing and not as an important figure in a group RP or an RP with an established and desired dynamic ). \n\nLucky isn't bad, but you can be **too** lucky. Surviving a devastating war conflict by luck could be interesting if it's meant to give the character experience and scars ( physical or mental ) from the event. It is not however interesting if used for the purpose for the character 'just to be there'.\n\nDon't be afraid to be creative with a backstory but make sure the creative parts have reason, setting consistency, and does not utterly outshine the rest of the people involved. In the end a backstory is a character's personal journey up to the point of play, a justification for it's feelings, thoughts, and natural actions. Events forge them, no matter how big or small.",
