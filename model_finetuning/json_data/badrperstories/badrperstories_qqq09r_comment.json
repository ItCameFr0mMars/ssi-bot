            "body": "I've had patches of this, depending on how things are going irl, how my energy levels are doing, and just my seasonal mood. The good thing is it gets a lot easier to deal with over time once you know how to \"catch\" yourself. So I'll build on what others have said.\n\n* If you catch yourself in a negative loop it can help to go and do something completely unrelated. I don't know about you, but I can get a bit negative/tense when I've got work I need to do, or a pending to-do list of other things. It's important to not weigh too heavily on a hobby to avoid real life stuff. \n* Remember you are still a great writer, independent of whether that person is currently writing a lot with you or not. Sometimes different interests just take someone's fancy for a while.\n* If you have the time and willing, I'd say branching out on roleplays with different people is a biiiig plus. Everyone brings their own set of unique qualities to a roleplay, and what you can get out of them will be differently valuable. It'll allow you to not fixate on one thing while broadening your exposure - a great way to get even better at rp, too.\n* Cut yourself some slack! Your partner is still rping with you, and rps can go through sprints and lags now and then *even* if they're great quality and you get on very well OOC. If the momentum isn't great it may pick up at another time as things change in the plot. Also keep in mind, new partners tend to need more attention for a while as things get set up in the roleplay. How long that takes varies a lot.",

            "body": "Like /u/AttentiveRoleplayer said, you're just going to have to deal with it. We all get jealous thoughts. Jealousy is fine, it's a natural human emotion- it's ENVY that is the problem (when you hurt/sabotage the person you're jealous of). Be proud that you have the maturity to not be envious and instead turn your attention inward and work on yourself.\n\nHowever. The feeling may just not be logical at all and the partner you like may be simply prioritising others for more rational and boring reasons, like they know better what to write in these other instances. It could just be paranoia. \n\nOverall, however... this is going to be blunt and defeatist, but:\n\n1. don't roleplay on forums/public spaces. Go 1x1.\n\n2. get more partners and cultivate your self-esteem. \n\n I never have and never will RP on forums, partly because I know that my insecurity can rear its head. I have always roleplayed with personal partners one on one via Discord, Skype, etc. Unless you're looking to improve your writing via competition and learning from others, don't roleplay in groups/public places. You sound like you have an insecure personality and that's fine, but you need to understand that some stimuli like social preference, attentiveness, etc is just always going to beat you over the head no matter how much you mature and work on yourself. In my opinion, insecurity is not always best treated by exposure therapy (i.e. letting yourself feel that way and gritting your teeth through it).\n\nYes, my partners most likely have others. I know they do. I know they may be having a fun time with them or be really good friends with them, really love the writing of their partners, maybe even like them/their stories more than mine, etc. But I know my writing is good- I have confidence in myself and my characters. So I shrug and think 'what I don't know can't hurt me' and just don't think about it because my partners have a right to roleplay with whoever they want.",

Now ask yourself why did you do that? \nIs it because you like them more? Or is it because they had the oldest last reply out of everyone else? Or you just simply picked a random person? Or maybe you were just inspired a little more for that plot than the others? \n\nYou literally can't reply to everyone at once, which means one of the situations above might be the case, or maybe others. Now apply the same reasoning to your partners. \n\nMy advice is to not take it personally at all, because there are a lot of possibilities that don't even try to question your writing skills, and you'd only hurt yourself by stressing over nothing.",

And this isn\u2019t to be mean. \n\nMy issue is that I often feel jealousy when my rp partners on public forums seem to feel more excited about other characters than mine. For example: them say, telling me how excited they are for a certain plot point they have with another Oc on the forum/server and then being like \u2018 but we def need to come up with a plot for our characters!! \u2018 \n\nAnd frankly. I had to learn that they are people snd are allowed to have fun or more excitement for things that don\u2019t pertain to me. Even more muse. That doesn\u2019t mean the don\u2019t like me or my oc. Just that something else has their attention and that is OKAY. It\u2019s okay. \n\nIf you like chocolate ice cream more that pistachio ice cream. But you eat both. Does that make pistachio now disgusting? No. Same applies here. \n\nSome people have more muse for things than others. And sometimes one idea might get their creative juices flowing so they always have a quick time replying to it. Stop obsessing. Nothing is wrong with your writing, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely. And wait your turn. \n\nIt\u2019s not gonna stop you from feeling jealous. That feeling never goes away. Trust me, example A here myself. I\u2019m feeling jealous right now over something as I type this. But you can whether it. I believe in you OP.",

I also slow down when a scene would rile me up or excite me too much, as I am *hardcore* when it comes to ensuring I do not accidentally trip into the self-insert path.\n\nAll of those situations would require me to deal with other scenes first, to pump out those posts and get them out of the way because they don\u2019t require as much brain process. When that\u2019s done, THEN I\u2019ll sit somewhere comfortable, have a cup of coffee and work on on the deeper scenes with full attention.",

Feeling jealous and insecure is only a problem if you end up acting out and attacking the other player over it, as long as you let them free to do whatever they want it's not wrong to feel this way, I think it happens to a lot of us.\n\nYou also need to remember your partner most likely isn't responding first to someone else because they are thinking 'oh, OP sucks and I don't wanna write for them', most of the times I'm sure it has nothing to do with you. Sometimes one is more in the mood to write about/for a certain character instead of another one, or a certain setting, or in that moment maybe they find easier to respond to them because it takes less concentration than for your story. There can be a lot of reasons, in my experience I can assure you my responding to someone before another player 99% of the times has everything to do with how I'm feeling and nothing to do with how good they are. Hell, when I *really* like how the other player writes I take more time to respond because I want to be sure it's gonna be as good as what they wrote.",

Sometimes it\u2019s whoever replied first, sometimes it\u2019s which reply chain is most plot relevant, sometimes it\u2019s the one we find to be the most interesting. Often that isn\u2019t necessarily about which person writes better, but who just had a better plot strand going. Something that\u2019s doing some in depth character development will probably go before more superficial interactions.\nSometimes, however, during the bulk replies, the person replying might get tired or their work break/lunch break ends, or a class starts and they have to save the next set of bulk replies for later. The other reply threads get their replies out during that time, and they might end up starting with them again for one reason or another.\nJust try to keep in mind that they\u2019re firing out these replies in between the hustle and bustle of their normal life. It helps for me to think that that person\u2019s probably just tired or hungry or busy and they were just trying to get something out for the day.",
