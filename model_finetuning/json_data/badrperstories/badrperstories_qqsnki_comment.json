            "body": "How long did this RP partnership last?\n\nThis guy is TA because:\n\n* He wanted you to challenge yourself to what, exactly? Not sleeping? That's a crock of shit and I'd kick him to the roleplayer's curb.\n* When he asked for a different RP and you declined it, he \"insisted.\" Not taking no for an answer is grounds for a block.\n* He hounded you about the RP while you were enjoying your free time. I'd block his ass for that, too.\n* Only when you stood your ground did he bother apologizing for his shitty behavior. He sounds like a young teenager.\n\nObviously you shouldn't have snapped if you never expressed how much all these things bothered you. It's always better to handle things civilly, and in the future I would practice saying things like, \"Sorry, this RP partnership isn't working out.\" That's all you need to say. If they keep messaging you after that, block 'em.\n\nYou did do the right thing ending the RP with him. You do not owe any writing partner a second chance if you don't want to give them one. You can end an RP for any reason under the sun, and partners simply have to accept it.\n\nBugging the shit out of people for responses is not \"showing commitment,\" it's being a pain in the ass. Don't let anybody spin it differently. It's fine to remind people, but it sounds like he was more persistent than necessary.\n\nYou may very well have been overly harsh telling the guy to \"fuck off,\" but you were right to get rid of him. If the guilt is nagging at you you could unblock long enough to apologize for the outburst, but I'd block straight away after that as he will most likely go back to pleading for that \"second chance.\"\n\nGoing forward, stand your ground firmly from the start so you can avoid getting to that boiling point that causes you to lash out at people. This only applies if you were genuinely rude to him. If you said something like, \"you're really bothering me and I no longer want to write with you,\" you weren't out of line at all.",
