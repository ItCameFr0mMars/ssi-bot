I just wanted to check in and make sure you're enjoying the RP. Right now there's not much my character can do, but if you'd like me to further the plot more we can think of ways to change the situation!\"\n\nOf course you can be less vague; without knowing what's going on that prevents your character from taking action I can't get too specific. Basically, make sure your partner is cool with the status quo and be ready to help carry the plot as soon as your character has the autonomy to do so.",
