            "body": "As others have pointed out, I think it's one of those things that, when in the wrong hands, can be awkward or off-putting, or a mark of immaturity in the player, for all the reasons cited: self-inserts, tendency to blur the line between character and player, writing from only one POV, etc.\n\nThat being said, I don't think it *has* to mean any of those things. There are plenty of books written in first-person, and it can certainly be gripping and immersive to read. But *usually* those are written from only one character's POV -- the \"main one,\" and of course in roleplay you'll have at least two POVs, so maybe the jumping back and forth can be jarring? Third person tends to be more conducive to more characters, especially when each player may take on a host of secondary characters/NPCs as well. \n\nOne thing I like to do is find ways to insert first-person snippets, such as if one of my characters is writing a letter or journal (I don't do as much modern-day RP, but texting/e-mail would work too!) I like the chance to \"get into my character's head\" in that way, plus it's just fun to change things up now and then. \n\nAnyway, don't let the general consensus on first-person deter you from trying it! I think it helps to be versatile in various perspectives and tenses. For instance, when I first got into roleplay, the trend was for present-tense, and it was only when I got back into it (just before COVID) that I realized everyone was writing in past-tense. It took a bit of practice, but I was able to shift into that, although every now and then I'll find a player who still likes present-tense, so I enjoy the versatility.\n\nAny type of writing is good practice and builds your writing skills up, so don't be afraid to experiment!",

So there's no \"I\" in the role play. And for narrative purposes, third person is generally more suited. (From what I was taught at least)\n\nThe only first person novels I have ever read and studied (because damn mandatory literature class, but our teacher drilled a lot of theory first and beforehand), while they did have narration and actions, they were far more focused on their internal conflicts and how they see things - even if completely disillusioned. Those that I have found, were all psychological novels, even if it was not noticeable at first glance. One particular novel was so fucking bad... like I could never hate a fictional character so much - maybe that also unfairly contributed to my aversion lol. \n\nLike you see it pink, I see it blue, but then the narrator comes and say it's actually green. And when presenting a scene, it's better for your partner to present it how it is and let them interpret it, instead of how you'd character see it. \n\nOn top of that, a lot of first person role players I have encountered have basically wiped out the fine line between OOC and IC, and things got uncomfortable quickly. If it was also smut involved... things went down the drain really quickly and I never left so fast in my whole life.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a bad style at all. For me it's more of a personal preference compared to bad experiences. But there are others that are fine with both, so if you can use both comfortably as you said, I wouldn't worry.",

Basically an autobiography from a fictatious character.\n\nWriting a roleplay with TWO people and writing in first person is a) jarring because now we're both talking in first person or one first-one third so it feels like it's YOUR story and not OUR story, and b) like others said: speaking in first person feels like you're playing as yourself....which is literally what first person chat or RPing is.",

Your partners are reading your post just as you read theirs. First-person works for novels because we are expected to put ourselves in the shoes of the character.\n\nIn role-play however the standard is writing as a character independent from yourself. While first-person works for you, your partner reading your post must then refer to your character as 'themselves' during the reading. \n\nThird is just cleaner, friendlier to read, and has less bad connotations with it. In the end write however you want but first-person is playing with a handicap in turn of making yourself enticing to write with in prospective partners.",
