Just because someone's in the same group server with you doesn't mean you need to RP with them, unless there's some sort of specific plot requirement due to the role you've taken on.\n\nMy stance is that in a group RP, if I'm not the person vetting them, I don't need to roleplay with them. That's the admins' and mods' jobs. I'm here on my free time, so, I'm gonna do what I think is fun.\n\nIf this type of person approaches me in a group, I just make up something noncommittal about how I've currently got too many scenes, or I don't have 'the muse' for whatever they're proposing, whatever. They'll probably eventually figure out you're blowing them off, but unless it violates the server rules in some way, so what? If they complain to a mod/admin that you're, idk, deciding you'd rather spend your free time roleplaying with other people, just tell the mod/admin that you have a personal issue with the other player and you don't think you can be neutral when roleplaying with them, so you've decided it's best if you don't RP with them.\n\nYou're in a group RP, but that doesn't mean you need to be best buds with all the other players. You're not being cruel or starting drama, you're just prioritizing your enjoyment during an activity that occurs in your free time. You're not getting paid to do this.\n\nThen again, I've straight-up blocked people in some of the group RPs I'm in because I find them annoying. Mods didn't care, because I wasn't causing problems.",

We would use Twitter to RP, but basically you were damned if you do or damned if you didn't RP with certain people. This former female alternative 'goth' DJ turned cyberstalker didn't get the hint, especially after I stopped interacting with her when she'd have her character hit on my openly gay male character and then turn around to use microaggressions as a means to argue and gaslight both ICly and OOCly.  \n\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable RPing with this person and they're making you feel this way? Again, definitely talk to a moderator if it's a server or someone who has some kind of authority. The needs of the roleplay should never go before the needs of your own comfort. *Ever*.
