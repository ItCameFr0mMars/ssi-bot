They probably won't retain all the important details that way, either.\n\nThe good news is: all they *need* to know starting out about your character are the things their character(s) can see/feel/smell/hear, and what they might reasonably know going in.

If your character is a wanted criminal and theirs is tracking them down, they probably need to know a few historical details.)\n\nKeep your infodump in a doc so you can be sure you don't forget anything, but let the backstory come out IC.
