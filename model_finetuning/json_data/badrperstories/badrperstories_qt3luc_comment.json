Something will go wrong with a family member, I'm called away to visit someone, I get sick, or something else happens that keeps me too busy to roleplay. When my partner goes quiet and stops replying, I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that something similar has happened to them. Sometimes people just need a little space.\n\nBut after a couple weeks, I usually throw them a message (\"Hey! I hope everything is going alright.\") and try not to make it passive-aggressive. The priority is their wellbeing, not the roleplay. If they don't reply at all, I give it another week before I close communications (\"Hi! I figure you've lost interest in our roleplay or just have too much on your plate right now. If you'd ever like to continue, feel free to add me again.\") and remove them. A couple have contacted me down the road to apologize for disappearing and continue writing, but for the most part, it's a polite goodbye. \n\nThe worst thing is when life gets hectic and I haven't had the time or mental energy to think about roleplaying, and my partner starts sending multiple messages or getting passive-aggressive. Sometimes I'll drop a roleplay for that reason alone.",

            "body": "So a lot of people are saying \"that depends on the partner,\" but tbh my take is more, \"at whatever point you find it distracting, and need closure.\"\n\nI've had people who ghosted me come back after months or years, but just because that has happened doesn't mean I'm going to wait that long. If I have to send a 'check in,' I've already mentally assumed I've been ghosted and move on.\n\nThat said, I suppose I can take this approach of 'accepting I've been ghosted' early on because I don't see ghosting as an irredeemable sin that ends the RP, and have partners who just...tend to ghost and then pop up from the ether in the unforeseeable future, and that's just how it goes. I don't need to hold out hope I haven't been ghosted, because I don't mind being ghosted. What I personally can't deal with is the 'wondering if I have/have not been ghosted' stuff. I'd rather just assume I have and move on in my life than sit around waiting, but that's also a personal thing; I'm prone to ruminating and repetitive thoughts, so making a decision is better for my mental health, even if it later ends up being incorrect (and since I roleplay with chronic ghosters, there isn't a consequence to being wrong beyond that I kept my peace of mind.)",
