            "body": "I completely agree, and even with a roleplay partner that I\u2019ve worked with for a year now (the vast majority of my entire time RPing), I still feel uncomfortable even just getting their character to do something I know they\u2019d do. For example, if a strange noise came from behind them and I know their character would turn around to see what it was, I would still feel pretty anxious to even imply that they turned around. I\u2019m the worldbuilder and they\u2019re the explorer, so since their main job is to have their characters react to my plot (or one that we\u2019ve worked on together, but I tend to be the \u2018mysterious unknown character/occurrence\u2019), I really wouldn\u2019t want to steal that. I know that doesn\u2019t apply for everyone, and a lot of people have different consensual agreements of boundaries (maybe they\u2019ve spoken and agreed that it moves the plot faster/gives more creative control when they\u2019re allowed to puppeteer each other\u2019s characters, maybe they\u2019ve strongly agreed on a hard boundary that they can\u2019t touch each other\u2019s characters with a 10 foot long pole. Both are very understandable, but I think most rps operate somewhere in between. For me, my understanding of that is suggestions/implications (or mild puppetry, if you\u2019re pushing it). For example; \u2018A strange noise obnoxiously made itself known behind [x]. When/if he turned around, he saw/would see-\u2018 You get the point. Or, for some characters, it depends on their situation. I\u2019ve got a character with that same RP partner who\u2019s literally a puppet (he became one after being cursed by one of my other characters, so it was obviously with my permission), and their character has the puppeteer\u2019s cross. With that cross, he (and by that logic, my RP partner) can freely control him. Of course, communication is also important, I\u2019d tell my RP partner if their character oversteps/abuses their power or just does something that might hurt the plot. Because they\u2019re a nice and understanding person, they\u2019d be fine with it and change their reply, but there are some people who may throw fits. \u2018But he\u2019s literally a puppet, and I\u2019ve got the puppeteer\u2019s cross!\u2019 \u2018But you told me I could have control over him whenever I wanted!\u2019 So yeah, watch out for that if you\u2019re gonna put your character in this kind of position, and it\u2019s probably a good idea to clearly state your rules for their control over that character. Especially if you\u2019re not sure that communicating will work (but if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s probably best to think about whether they\u2019re worth continuing to rp with in the first place).",
