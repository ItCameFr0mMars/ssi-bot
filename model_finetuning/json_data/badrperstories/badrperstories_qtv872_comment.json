            "body": "One such habit that I've seen pop up surprisingly often (maybe it's just specific to the RP community I'm a part of, not sure), is the overuse of \"would\" or \"attempt\" in people's posts. Since it has been ingrained in them that godmodding is bad and should be avoided at all costs, there's been this form of view that you need to word everything as an attempt/conditional so that you don't come off as a godmodder. I've also seen cases where people were in fact accused of godmodding because they didn't word their attack as an attempt despite the said post not in any way controlling the other character or dictating the outcome of the attack.\n\nAs an example of this sort of thing, people'll write \"Jane would shoot John with an arrow\" or \"Jane attempts to shoot John with an arrow\" instead of simply saying that she shot the arrow while still leaving the effects of that action up to the other player. I've seen this sort of writing even extend past actions that affect other characters, resulting in sentences like \"Jane would smile and walk towards the table\".",

I know a lot of people who compulsively define their characters by how they're different/diverse and just kinda assume that makes them interesting but it doesn't. That's not how it works. If everyone else in a group happens to be playing a girl, you should not *assume* that they're desperately waiting for you to rescue them from this by playing a boy. It's fine if you want to play one, but it won't contribute even a little to making your character interesting on its own.\n\nAnd people can get really into this, to the point it clouds their judgement. And then they wind watching in confusion as people they perceive as playing a more undiverse cast get more attention without understanding how this way of thinking is sabotaging them. And the worst part is that I often struggle with finding a polite way to explain to people who do this what they're doing wrong.\n\n**Bad Habit 2) Metagaming gets a pass**\n\nPeople get really sore about godmodding and powergaming but are comparatively way too willing to give metagaming a pass despite it being just as bad. People should react to someone wanting to play Deadpool the same way they react to someone wanting to play God. Having an edgy borderline-omniscient 4th wall breaking character around tends to be just as disruptive as having a disgustingly overpowered character around. The only difference is that more people find metagaming and 4th wall breaking funny. Which is \"great\" until it violently derails any attempt to write a serious scene, making life Hell for the people who aren't laughing.\n\n**Bad Habit 3) Biting off more than you can chew**\n\nI'm definitely guilty of this one. Lemme just apply for 30 characters, a good 5 of which will ever see in-depth development and the rest of which will just kinda exist and banter with people.\n\n**Bad Habit 4) Judgmentalness and Heckling**\n\nIt's really easy to teasingly mock trends and rain on people's parades and suddenly the people who liked those trends and liked those parades leave or distance themselves. Oh what's that? X person(s) plays a lot of gay characters? Wow, I'm sure mouthing off about that won't negatively impact their self-esteem or make them feel insecure about being part of the group at all. THANKS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI desperately want to rant about people who complain about things being quiet while doing nothing other than complaining to fix that but I'm pretty sure that's not a Good RPer thing.",

            "body": "A bad habit I formed... I have one really bad one that I KNOW I have but I can't get rid of.\n\nSo, when I was younger and didn't know what RP'ing was, I was introduced to it. Of course, at the time, I was more of a fanfiction author than anything else, so when I started an RP, I wanted to keep RP'ing the same thing for as long as possible- get through an entire plotline. Being that I was a *fanfiction* author (still am wooo), I would usually do RPs that were in the vein of 'we start with canon material and we'll burn it as we go with our OCs until the future is so unrecognizable we'll question how we got here'. This has (and probably always will be) my favorite kind of RP.\n\nThe **problem** arose when the people I rp'd with started wanting to do new RPs *constantly*. They would be all-for an idea one day, then toss it aside the very next.- This went on for about a year, before I took a year semi-off from RP'ing (I still did a few RPs in that year, but it was heavily limited who I did them with). However, coming back into RP'ing as more of a hobby than a side-thought, I've noticed that my drive for RPs doesn't last anywhere near as long as it used to. Usually, I'll be invested in a story for a few hours- but the investment is so *light* because I expect my RP partner to call it quits partway in, so I let myself get distracted by whatever else shiny-new-thing comes along. This has resulted in me **starting** a whole ton of RPs in the past two years, and then *dropping* them within two or three days, usually.- Sometimes, I'll even hype up an idea for WEEKS before asking if the other person is down to RP it... Annnnnd drop it about eight days later, completely abandoned.\n\nWhen I first started RP'ing, one of my VERY FIRST RPs actually lasted about six months, and covered the entire Minecraft: Story Mode series (season one only at the time). These days... Well, not so much. I actually recently just started telling people I won't be RP'ing on Discord anymore, since that's where I seem to drop the most RPs. I still do RPs on other sites (Tumblr namely) but... I'm always worried I'll drop a thread just because I don't seem to be as invested in any storyline as I once was.\n\nSo I guess you can say my habit is not being invested... And if I am invested, losing investment really early on.",

            "body": "This might be a rant so apologies, but your post OP, definitely makes me think about an experience I\u2019ve had!\n\nOne of my most recent experiences with Roleplaying frustrated me so much I\u2019ve not Roleplayed since - nearly a year has passed and I still get irritated by thinking about it.\n\nI had an RP partner who was actually a really, *really* good Roleplayer. They had a great understanding of the canon of the world we were playing in, were very enthusiastic about it and the sort of characters and stories that would be feasible in the setting we were playing in. They were also great at writing detailed responses with character development in mind, and they were also up for a slow burn romance (which is really the only form of romance I have any interest in playing). Additionally, we got on well OOC, and had many nerdy discussions about plots, fandoms, games and music. However after a few months into the RP, I noticed things started changing, and I started getting frustrated.\n\nMetagaming is *not* the same thing as plotting, and isn\u2019t cool to do to satisfy yourself OOC. I really think my partner thought I was an idiot, and that I didn\u2019t understand they were trying to manipulate me and whole the RP because they had an OOC crush on my character (they even admitted they get *very* attached to characters a few times), and slyly were going to Metagame to get what they wanted both IC and OOC. \n\nIt started by asking OOC if my character would like their character more if they had them do this or do that, just in a much more subtle way. But it seemed to just grow and grow, and I just ended up reading between the lines and seeing it for exactly what it was. Eventually, this evolved into them saying in OOC chat \u2018I don\u2019t know what my character should do - help!\u2019 When things got a bit tense IC, when they really meant, \u2018tell me how to make our characters *not* fall out\u2019. Or awkwardly laughing in a semi annoyed, slightly passive aggressive manner saying, \u2018omg I didn\u2019t expect your character to react that way! Wth? Lmaoooo\u2019 When things didn\u2019t go their way after my character was taken advantage of sexually whilst drugged out of their minds, as they thought they\u2019d be \u2018into it\u2019, and would be impressed\u2026 somehow?\n\nI\u2019m very much in the story-telling camp and not the wish fulfilment camp. While I obviously enjoy a good plot, I enjoy having characters behaving organically and being true to themselves as it makes it more engaging and realistic in my book. Also the idea of an interaction going wrong and sending the plot in a totally different direction is fascinating and exciting! Being able to improvise and adapt is one of the reasons I *adore* RPing as an art form. My RP partner at the time had previously agreed strongly with me on this, so I thought we were on the same page when the RP first started, but it just became more and more the opposite the more their OOC attachment to my character grew.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, Metagaming *can* be okay in *very* certain circumstances, as long as everyone consents to it and it doesn\u2019t become this thing to fall back on to make the story conflict free and easy. But when it\u2019s done to satisfy someone OOC whilst butchering their own character to do so? That\u2019s not cool in my book. It pulls me right out of the story and throws me into a pit of frustration. It was a shame as the RP plot we had going on was actually really fun, and is actually my favourite RP to date! It\u2019s just a shame how an OOC obsession can create a habit that totally wrecks a story, and makes someone\u2019s skill as a Roleplayer almost totally void. \n\nThis situation leads me on to briefly mention something else: People \u2018getting their kicks\u2019 out of Sexual RP can (depending on the individual as it\u2019s not always the case at all!) be detrimental to the story. The Metagaming situation above came from a desire of my partner to turn our story into smut and smut alone after our characters \u2018did the deed\u2019 for the first time, and my partner I think enjoyed it a little \u2018too much\u2019 lol. Whilst I don\u2019t mind writing the occasional sex scene at all, when that becomes the \u2018goal\u2019 of someone OOC, it makes it difficult for the other writer to break free of. I even wrote in my search thread that I didn\u2019t just want to write sex scenes all the time with my partner, and mentioned it multiple times as politely as I could when talking about plots\u2026 but noooo, the text based, rp boning habit, became a call my partner just couldn\u2019t ignore ha!  \n\nCurrently I\u2019m debating to get back into RP again, but am very sceptical lol",

Lots of the RP places on there, *heavily* enforce the \u2018everything your character does should be an *attempt*\u2019 rule, so naturally everyone always used to write \u2018attempts\u2019 when an action can impact another writer\u2019s character. Only until I discovered forum/discord RP, I stopped doing this after years of being worried about being seen as a godmodder and reported for breaking the rules of not \u2018attempting\u2019 ha. However, I never understood the whole \u2018would\u2019 scenario. I\u2019ve seen it done unfortunately too many times, but can honestly say that isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s weird how your environment - even online - can dictate how you write or what rules you subconsciously follow. Glad I got away from that platform however as it\u2019s a remarkably cliquey community and expensive if you want to actually find RP on there!",
