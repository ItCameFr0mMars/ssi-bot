Your title implies the issue was with the gore, but then go on to say the real issue was them controlling your character. Of course, you have the right to terminate the roleplay for any reason, and \"I don't like excessive gore\" and \"you're controlling my character\" are both perfectly adequate reasons to do so. \n\nAs far as the gore goes, I don't really like reading excessive descriptions of gore (it's not a trigger for me, I just don't enjoy it), but if I'm in a server that doesn't explicitly have rules against it, it's probably best to have a conversation about limits before a scene is initiated to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nControlling your character is potentially against server rules, and if so, you may want to talk to a mod, even if the conversation is simply, \"I don't want this person to get banned, but I think someone needs to explain to them why this isn't allowed.\"",

We talked about it beforehand and she literally asked \"torture and kill me, ok?\". She went a little hard, even for me (chopped of limbs hung on the wall of the living room) , but I told her to go as hard as she wanted so I didn't really complain. \n\nAnother time I did a \"tamer\" one with a guy, that rp is still going actually, but he had sex with a werewolf girl and she was getting to rough, so he let her gnaw on his arm as a \"distraction\" (he was invincible for plot reasons). Anyway, ended with her ripping it off wholesale..",
