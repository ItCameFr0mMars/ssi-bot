I find that when I give these people a chance, it becomes clear why they get ghosted (i.e. super pushy for nsfw, not writing nearly as much as they promised, terrible grammar, etc)\n\nYou can wait around a bit more if you want, but I wouldn't count on it. It's better to cut your losses and to find new partners you might miss out on if you wait around.",
