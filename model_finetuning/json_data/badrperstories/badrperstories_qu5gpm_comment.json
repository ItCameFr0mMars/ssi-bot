You already said you won't go back a third time (which I agree, you should probably leave him alone), so the only thing you can really do is better yourself and make sure you don't treat someone like that again. You don't need to hate yourself or let the guilt overwhelm you.

That's the real dark theme.\n\nIf it consoles you, people in the rping community have sorta a requirement to get used to these emotional bullet punches. A partner showering someone with compliments and affection one day then ghosting them the next? That's life... At the very least, your feelings were real, but then they died off.\n\nPerhaps, if you pick rping back again, you could look to have multiple partners with different styles at the same time?

Or be more upfront about what's bothering you, that works too unless you become the person who has to end one in every two rps due to something that resonated wrong.",

Were you strictly RP partners or on more friendly terms?\n\nIf friends - shoot him a message, share your decision to no longer RP, and let him decide. Do not block him, because then it defeats the entire point of contacting him again. If he decides that he's not interested in staying in contact, don't try to change his mind.\n\nIf strictly RP partners - well, you don't want to RP. That's perfectly fine, but then why would you contact him? Yet another apology won't right any wrongs.",
