Instead of properly explaining, the mod just quoted the bit that needed the post to be flagged and was very passive aggressive about it. That\u2019s simply my two cents given The tone of the post. Op didn\u2019t seem argumentative until the mod continued on. But hey, modding is hard. Sometimes you come off harsher than expected.\n\nAlso, maybe she mentioned it either because it\u2019s a copy and paste from a non reddit ad, she was unsure as to whether or not the plot would evolve into NSFW happening and thought that given it wasn\u2019t likely to do so that it didn\u2019t matter or maybe she\u2019s had to state in the past that erp is something she\u2019s not too into. We don\u2019t know.\n\nMost subs, if it\u2019s the posters first time, will warn the poster that their post needs to be marked and will do it for them and warn them to do it in the future. If needed, they\u2019ll explain the rule in further detail cause let\u2019s face it, most people don\u2019t read the rules unless it\u2019s in a post. Even then it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to think they will. I feel like the mod over stepped because they were being a bit passive aggressive after op promised to remedy the mistake in the future, which maybe the mod mistook as a sign of not caring. Like, there was a very simple way it could\u2019ve been fixed and the mod didn\u2019t need to continue commenting either but hey, each to their own.\n\nI just feel the mod may have been a bit more heavy handed than they should\u2019ve been over what feels and looks like a commonly made mistake.",

The OP immediately went to \u201cyou misunderstood\u201d which is going to put anyone on the defensive, especially when the mod didn\u2019t misunderstand, the OP was unclear. I\u2019m betting if the OP posted \u201cno ERP\u201d instead we would not be having the convo. It is not up to the mod to do the correction, it is up to them to make sure people follow the rules. \n\nAlso, not reading the rules doesn\u2019t give you a pass to violate them. The rules are the rules, I was permanently banned from a sub for unknowingly violating one of their hard rules and I accepted it, I didn\u2019t argue back because I was the one who failed to do my part. \n\nIf it was a copy and paste OP could have simply been like \u201cOpe my bad let me fix that.\u201d instead of arguing back why she didn\u2019t feel like the flair was appropriate. And again, it\u2019s really weird to me that one would mention ERP as being something they could do if they didn\u2019t want it in the RP. Details like that can and should be negotiated in the premise stage. \n\nThe OP still doesn\u2019t understand or feel like she was in the wrong which is why she posted here looking for validation. But here it is: you were wrong, OP.",
