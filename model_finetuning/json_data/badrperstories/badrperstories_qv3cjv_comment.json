However, since we're on Reddit and we're here to philosophize, I can also go ahead and tell you why *some* people do it, but not on Discord or rapid-fire.\n\nI dislike this just as much personally, but some people who do asynchronous replies (once every few days, daily, etc, essentially *not* a sit-down-and-play session) might try to assume what your character does just \"not to waste time\" and move things along in a \"reasonable\" timeframe compared to the real time they're spending writing with you. So they will say more than a few sentences per post, and do more than a few actions, assuming your character will respond in a way that does *not* alter all that.\n\nIs that a good practice? Personally for me it's not, but I've met people who are cool with it, if they don't do it themselves. Thus, a matter of preference.",

I don't RP a realtor, but that's a great example of a situation where one has to 'walk' through a place while my partner learns the layout.  \n\n\nHowever people taking complete control of the character without any sort of OOC dialogue is perhaps one of the most annoying things that I hate running into. I've told this tale before, but there was a guy that was OOCly hyperfixating on the other gay characters in the community and one of them happened to be an alt who I was just struggling to write. While I didn't have any kind of scene with them, they were often OOCly telling me that they wanted to get our characters together, to even having their 'wedding' planned in an MMO setting where the world is on the precipice of ending. There aren't butterflies, puppies, and bunnies, let alone weddings. It's a gruesome, dark, horror-fest. Or supposed to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say that after they were basically planning everything, it took telling them no three times and basically calling them out that they were basically thirst posting the face credits for his character to have a 'boyfriend' and when he couldn't force another person into a relationship he had his character go super cringe and get so reckless that it might as well have been self-harm. It's a setting where people don't stay dead, so he just came back like \"So that's what that feels like\" after posting a spotify playlist of 'hurt' music and visiting his mother's grave. To make matters worse, this person is well in the 25+ age bracket. The fit throwing with this type I feel is pretty universal, but the means of execution of said tantrum varies. lol",
