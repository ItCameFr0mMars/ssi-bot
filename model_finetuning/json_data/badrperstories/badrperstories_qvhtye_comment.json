I know that proper grammar is an important part for many RP lovers, so I didn't want to trigger anyone by reading my post :)\n\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that I would've created a new character or a different plot if this is what he wanted. He could've just told me instead of letting me know half way through our current plot. At least that way I would've been able to create a decent fleshed out OC I would actually enjoy playing, instead of a shell of a character I never cared for to begin with.\n\nSometimes our partners are dorks..",

I told them that it was unfair for them to withhold information and they got mad at me for being impatient. We ended the story and they explained nothing... that was the last RP I ever had with them.\n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is that it's okay to have some mystery but there's a fine line between surprising someone and being an asshole. That guy wanted a new story and put it on you out of no where. And you were uncomfortable with him wanting to use characters you didn't feel good with, he should have stopped there but he kept pressing forward. Maybe he should have just asked to use the characters in his own story.",
