Slice of life can be literally anything with tons of stories to tell and some nice experimentation. But every time I try it with another person who does slice of life they are insanely boring. They do nothing but write about a shitty uninteresting character who is easily forgettable. Not telling any kind of story except for the character sitting there and waiting you to carry everything. It's even worse when the partner wants romance because they suck at writing that as well expecting you to fall in love with a cardboard cutout. I love slice of life in the media but from my experience in rp it is one of the worst genres to ever crawl from the uncreative hole it came from.",

Hobbies are supposed to be fun and if other people are enjoying their play with people who are not you, it is petty AF to get so judgmental about something that ultimately does not involve you.  \n\n3) Talent is 100% subjective. If two people are playing and they're both having fun, power to them. Why do you care whether or not their writing is any good? Just don't roleplay with them. It's easy. If you're half as nice to them as you are here, they won't be bothered by not playing with you. \n\n4) Everyone starts out garbage. Even you, homeslice. No roleplayer in the history of roleplay has ever been the best they will ever be in their first plot. Or even their fifth. Being a dick because someone is new or isn't \"up to your high standards\" is a reflection on you, not them. \n\n5) I know this is Reddit, but if you wish to be a professional writer, proof read. As someone who has been published commercially and academically the easiest way to get your work rejected as an aspiring writer is to have a lazily uncorrected typo.",

            "body": "I agree with this so much and it kills me because I LOVE slice of life, but finding good slice of life roleplay has been nearly impossible.  I don't even bother looking for it anymore.  It's too much effort to filter through all the people who just want erp, all the self-inserts and people wanting pure wish fulfillment, and all the people who are just looking to play out stock scenes from anime or romcoms.\n\nI don't know why, but it's like people forget that characters actually need to DO SOMETHING to be interesting.  And they forget that stories need conflict and they need to actually lead somewhere.   So you end up either carrying the whole thing or settling for a series of loosely connected fluff pieces that don't add up to a story.\n\nOf course I come across these same problems in other genres as well.  I love fantasy, but there are plenty of characters whose only trait is 'hits things good' and stories that are nothing but 'we hit things and then go hit other things' which are just as boring for the same reasons.  But it's nowhere near as prevalent in other genres as it is in slice of life.\n\nIt's pretty disheartening.",

Roleplaying is supposed to be enjoyable, but you can't enjoy a role play when it's a collaborative effort and you're the only one pulling weight. In each of these plots I've noticed that sol main doesn't do much, there's rarely a plot to begin with. So I do my part and build on the plot and then it doesn't stop. The entire experience is lack luster and you feel like you were just writing with a computer rather than a person who has ideas. I don't have high standards I just wanna have fun, but each sol main I've come across new or old is flat out bland in terms of personality or storytelling. You'll often hear they don't have many friends or any ideas. I seek out each genre as way to learn something new and hopefully pick up a new favorite. But sol in the form of role-playing just sucks, the journey is bland and unfulfilling because the lack of any real story going on. \nIt's just going through the motions. If someone knows how to make sol interesting then by all means show me something new, give the genre the right shine it deserves.

            "body": "Dude it's clear you're butthurt because the genre is ruined by people of no taste. It's not the genre it's the ones who write in it. I like sol which is why every once in awhile I'll give it a go. But it sucks that 9 times out of 10 the plot comes off as boring. Like the 2014 Ninja Turtles film, yeah it looked fun but the execution of it was.....meh at best. I like sol but the writers of roleplaying are basic and bland not giving the partner a fun experience. Yes it can be good in the right hands, and I pray I find a good partner who will execute a good story in this genre. But the classic college, roommate, first date, family, love affairs, insert-random-thing-here story is just dead. This a genre that can explore just about anything and you'll often come across a lame forgettable idea. I hope it gets better but until then many people are going to be bored and leave mid rp or as soon as the plot ends because sol mains only provide an assignment you soon don't want to do. Sol isn't the only genre with this problem, every genre has it. But sol has it the most than the others. At first I thought I didn't like sol rps, but I kept trying and turns out I do like it and the genre. But the partner kills interest.",
