They saw two things on my list they were interested in. One of which they said \"But I assume you're not really interested in [thing]\". It was on my list. They took it *from my list*, so what the fuck did that even mean?\n\nI told them I was interested in that, thats why I put it on my list in the first place. They said \"Oh\" and they liked both things, but they couldn't decide between the two and would need a moment to give me a plot, which they finally admitted they had no idea of anything. Said I would like to work on a plot togetber if they decided on what exactly they wanted to do.\n\nNot only were they strangely rude about the whole thing as if I messaged them and told them I had no idea wtf I wanted, but came at me with absolutely nothing. Deleted. I was over it.\n\nI hate this. I don't need someone to come to me with a full plot, I actually kind of hate when people do as I love working up plots together. A rough idea is dope, a kick off point, literally anything.\n\nI do not carry plots, stories, characters, etc. I even put this in my searches. It's a partnership or the highway. But what I do need? Wtf you even want to write. If someone even messages me \"I want to write with you!\" And when I say \"sure! Anything you like?\" And they say \"I don't know, whatever\" I stop responding.\n\nHonestly. I cannot believe I ever attempted with people like this, because it is so much more calm when I just don't.",
