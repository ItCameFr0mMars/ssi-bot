This whole thing reads like you're young, possibly still a teenager but maybe a little older.  I think maybe you're a little less mature than some of the other people in the server.  Not in a bad or dramatic way, but more just inexperienced in both roleplaying and social awareness.  Perfectly normal stuff that will work itself out naturally.  You're fine.  I think what's really going on is that a lot of people found you annoying and they were kind of waiting for you to make any slip up so they could have an excuse to ban you.",

The Third Reich did. \n\nNow, maybe your character had military lineage from that time period which, say, defected to the Allies, or worked in espionage/counter intelligence against the Nazis from within Germany, or maybe they emigrated out of Germany before WWII, or any of a number of ways to avoid having a character who descended from Nazis, but can you see how such verbiage might lead people to draw conclusions about what you mean by that, particularly when put into the context of you feeling comfortable joking about your character driving a swastika car, and expecting others to get the reference?\n\nAnd I'm not even going to say it would be 'bad' to have a character who was descended from Nazis. Many ethnically German people are in that boat. The biggest issue I can see would be a character who beamed with pride about a military lineage which included Nazis in it and was supposed to be a sympathetic character.",

            "body": "I've done the math, and Soviets bad =/= Nazis good.\n\nI don't care what some Latvians think of some Nazis; I live in a country where people still periodically venerate a traitorous rebel army who have killed more of my countrymen than any other war my country has participated in, and did all of this because they wanted to keep people as property. To this day, the rebel flag is still flown with pride in some areas of the country. I'm sure someone can dig up 'a good thing' that some members of this rebel army did. I'd imagine they preserved/defended the homesteads of many citizens in their territory. War is almost universally ugly, and there's rarely a 'good' invading army in the history books. But that doesn't undo the fact that *what they were fighting for was wrong*.\n\nI'm going to guess that you're learning WWII history, and you're figuring out that your high school curriculum may have oversimplified the situation to cartoonish proportions, since most high school history classes in any country are basically pro-\\[insert country you live in\\] propaganda. But you're flirting with Nazi/fascist apologism in your rhetoric, and if you were in my RP server talking like this, it'd be one strike and you're out. Most people don't want to be around someone whose talking points include \"not all Nazis.\" It creates a hostile environment.",

            "body": "Let me preface this by saying I am German. And damn, that joke was tasteless as hell. Even without any other infractions, I would not fault the mods if they had removed you straight away, to be honest.\n\nYOU linked your character to nazism, by making the joke with the swastika. You said in your comments that people didn't (seem to) mind the OC before. That was most likely the case because they thought 'Well, not EVERY character like that has to be nazi, I sure hope that 55jw will deal with this topic in a sensitive way.' Mods and other people at a server often give people the benefit of the doubt, either because they:\n\n\\-didn't really think a lot about the implications of your character and his history\n\n\\-liked you as person and therefore thought you could deal with this topic in a sensitive way\n\n\\-they didn't like your Oc, but didn't want to cause a fuss and be called too sensitive, so they kept their mouth shut and just ignored the issues they might have had with him\n\nWhen you made that tasteless joke, people connected the dots. Can't really fault them for that. Like you say: 'I didn't say he was descended from nazis', but the possibility was always there, and you basically 'confirmed' it by suggesting that his car of choice would be a K\u00fcbelwagen with a Swastika on it. Why would you even connect him with the swastika, even in a joking way, and they go on like 'How do people get the idea he might be a nazi?'\n\nAnd to be honest...as a German myself, there is a veeery thin line between devoted patriots and nationalists, and neo-nazis here. Like, I don't know one reasonable German guy in the military/with a military family history who would act like your OC does...it certainly has some connotations, and most people are very mindful of it because they know about them. Maybe it's different for people who didn't live in Germany for a long time, or only have German ancestors, but still. My dad had a relative who was a pretty famous nazi personality, I even know a picture where this person stands next to Hitler. Even if he considers it an interesting fact of history, let's not pretend that being proud of it (even only for the military achievements) wouldn't be super questionable and most German people would be rightfully disgusted. Please, if you want to write characters like that, become a bit more mindful and sensitive when it becomes to this topic. Or you can't fault people for thinking that your character (or maybe even you yourself) might be a closet neo nazi. \n\nAlso, you seem a bit unaware how you/your OC comes across. You say multiple times that nobody had a problem with your OC, but then you say that multiple people commented on him being overpowered/knowing everything. There is a tiny rule I think: Because your character could (technically) know all that stuff, that still doesn't necessarily make the character a good fit for the roleplay if he is that knowledgable. It seems like people where hinting at that.",
