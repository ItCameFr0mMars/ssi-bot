It does help to think the ghosting partner is dealing with something. More likely though, they just couldn't handle conflict so preferred to ghost.\n\n\"Not interesting enough\" - I would say instead that you may not have been a good match. And that's fine. There have been plenty of people I'd like to write with, but it just didn't work out for a variety of reasons.

If they're going through a rough time right now, roleplay may be the last thing on their minds. And no matter how well you hit it off, you're still a relative stranger to them, and may simply not have been on their list of priorities whenever the shit hit the fan. It's not a personal slight, just realistic. Imagine if your life were upended by something traumatic -- remembering to notify all your RP partners might not be high on your list. It's quite possible this person just didn't want to deal and deleted everything in one fell swoop, or -- I don't know how this works, but if they delete their own username/account on Discord, do all their servers go too?\n\nAnyway, just trying to offer up another perspective. I have a feeling that half the time people ghost, it's not really to do with anything personal to that RP partner. Life happens. So does death. And roleplay just ain't that much of a priority in those situations.",
