I've thought maybe it's just something I should attempt to write solo, but roleplay has kind of made it difficult, as it's really hard to maintain my momentum without a partner to bounce things off of -- or, y'know, write half of it!\n\nSo, yeah, I don't really have any advice. Just commiseration since I know how that feels. Maybe you could try seeking out books/fiction or tv/movies similar to your idea and see if that scratches the itch? Although sometimes that just makes it worse because you're even *more* inspired!\n\nI feel your pain.",
