It almost sounds like someone from the setting I escaped.  \n\n\nI personally couldn't RP with a person if I'm pulling all the legwork, not to mention it opens myself up for content theft. After working on a plot over a year and a half get stolen and then made into a bastardized RE7 plot that just didn't make sense? I left my original setting and just went into TMI/Shadowhunters because there, at least, I know my content would probably be taken a little more seriously than where I came from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRealistically speaking though, I always have a full roster of OCs either in the backlog if I can't use a main. I don't understand how some people just need someone to create characters/accounts/plots for them because that's part of the writing/RP process. It's a hobby, if they can't get into those things then it often feels like they're not there for the legitimate hobby.  \n\n\nWhat perplexes me about your specific situation though is how can they build the personality if you're choosing things that mold said personality/background? Especially if they were any part of the Shadow World, but hey, that's just me being nitpicky about the fandom. I really could go into detail about that; one of my former partners was an Alec and boy did he not do the homework. lol",
