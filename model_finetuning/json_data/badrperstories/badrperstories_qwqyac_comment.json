We're practically puzzle pieces looking for that itty-bitty spot where we fit in. \n\nSo, be patient! Don't flex too far from what you're interested in simply to get a new partner. \n\nYou're welcome to message me a post sample if you'd like some honest critique.

            "body": "Let me preface that by saying that I can only judge you based on your post history, which is a little outdated. But because there is not much else to go from, I will use this.\n\n\\-some fandoms are notorious for having a lot of ghosters (or people who are not nice in general)\n\n\\-while going through your profile, I noticed that your old replies to searches often have some grammar/spelling errors. Like confusing 'your' and 'you're', 'vary' and 'very'. That isn't super bad, probably just autocorrect and even if it's a mistake, it's only something minor. But your first message leaves an impression, and if you don't proofread it, that might be a reason to turn you down for some people. There is also this title of one of your searches 'All right so I am getting pretty bored and intend on doing a new roleplay. I was thinking we could do a FAR CRY 5 roleplay. I was intending on being a male Edens gate cultist. You can do whatever you please with your own story. The genuine idea is the standard kidnapping that the cult is so known' -&gt; this is extremely hard to understand. Keep the title shorter and simple. People already know you're searching, because they see your search, no need to add that you're bored. If I read a title like that, I would probably not even click on the search, because it is so convoluted. And if I already have trouble getting what the title of the roleplay means, I would assume that I would also have the same trouble when reading your replies. Just use something simple like '(M4All) Searching for a Far Cry 5 roleplay, my character will be a male Eden's gate cultist'. This is enough, especially if you're pretty open when it comes to character that your writing partner will play. You can put the other information in the description.\n\n\\-being too accommodating and leaving a search too open can be a problem/turn-off for many roleplayers. When I read a search and I see something like 'you can do what you want'/'I offer to do everything you like', I assume that this person has either not thought in depth about the roleplay yet (and therefore doesn't have any preferences) or that they do have preferences which I will have to guess during the planning phase and if I am unable to do so, they will ghost or tell me the roleplay is boring and leave. Most people are not fine with everything.\n\nSame goes for the planning phase. If you only tell people 'It's fine I guess.' or 'Yeah, do whatever you like', it is possible that they will interpret this as you being uninvolved and not really interested in worldbuilding instead of thinking 'It's great that Tanner let's me do everything I want'. Saying 'This is a great idea for a character, maybe she could know my character because of (add new idea here)?' is much more appreciated. Roleplaying is a collaborative hobby after all. You can make suggestions for the other character in the planning phase, as long as you're not pushy.",
