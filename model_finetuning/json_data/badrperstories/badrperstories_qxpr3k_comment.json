At that point I legit just said, 'No, you can't do that.'\n\nThe second time was a lot less blatant but the OPness was still there. we were also RPing as gods that I made up and a few thousand posts into the RP they started making their main character be an entirely different species from the human they were supposed to be, and elevated them to God level as an Uber powerful god. I don't think she meant for her to be OP, maybe she was just trying to spice up the RP a bit cause it was slowing down and were were several thousand posts into it. \n\nSo these stories aren't really about controlling and OP partners, just OP partners xD",

By the sound of it, either it was very briefly discussed, or it just didn't come up which is why freeform RP tends to have a bad rep. It allows for these power trippy behaviors to bubble up and cause imbalance between the characters, even in 1x1's.\n\nAs someone who makes homebrew and agonizes over the balance of their freeform campaigns/plots, I always anticipate someone doing this so I set some pretty strict limitations in terms of what's possible, what's not, and if they can't stick to it then they're not actually there for the story. They're just there for the power dynamic or the idea of it.\n\nWith them being your friend though, this is where it makes things difficult. I cut out a couple of people who were basically RPing as if they had aspects of deities inside of them to the extent that it was warping the setting to something that wasn't supposed to be possible, in the worst ways possible. I'd tell them that the RP isn't working, that you value the friendship, but this isn't something you can continue.",
