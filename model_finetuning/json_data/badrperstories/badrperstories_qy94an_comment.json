It's not 'mean' to kick someone out if they can't behave, it's necessary and oftentimes people need to be forcibly removed from their fixation so that they can't get their 'fix'.  In the case of mass-flagging a dude in a game community that was bugging me it turned out there was several others to the point his mere presence made people uncomfortable or \"yeah we wanted to kick him but didn't have the receipts yet, now we do, yeet\".\n\nI'm not sure about reporting to the site specifically but screenshot links, a timeline/context and modmail should be enough for a given reddit board.  Most post report options let you pick something that isn't 'in regards to this board specifically'.\n\nThat said, if you have her blocked her posts should be showing up invisible to you in the first place - don't unblock or log out to compulsively check in on what she's doing, if you see a post on an alt account you feel is about you leave it alone, don't wade into her posts and start a conversation+replies because that hurts your case and starts to look like \"oh okay so they're both just mutually fighting\" instead of \"this person won't leave me the fuck alone\".  You can't really make the case that 'this person circumvented block' if you a) start a conversation in their thread b) sporadically unblock them c) keep on talking to them.",
