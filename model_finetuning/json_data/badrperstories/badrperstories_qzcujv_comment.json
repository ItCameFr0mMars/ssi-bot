Even that just gets fast tracked where it didn't even remotely matter.\n\nIt's also just as bad when people think that when someone is trying to actually develop their character, that they take every action as an affront to them personally and go full on cringe mode. \"Well your character didn't like mine, even though I was hyper obsessive! I'm going to make a post with veiled self-harm and bad emo music because my OC is actually a self-insert, I just haven't admitted it yet.\"\n\nExcuse me while I go vomit. Blech.",
