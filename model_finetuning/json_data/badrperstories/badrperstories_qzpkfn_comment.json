I've received advice from users here which helped me out a great deal. What I ended up doing was posing the issue I've had with my rp partner of 3 months by using statements focused on I, myself. I told him I was struggling to come up with ideas on my own and asked if he had any input. He didn't take any offense to that and began coming up with plot points on the spot. In your case, you could either tell them politely that you don't feel your styles mesh and would like to end the roleplay, or ask if they would be willing to slow the plot down to hear out some of your ideas for a change.\n\nIf you bring up concerns with your rp partner using kind language and they react poorly, then they probably weren't worth your time in the first place. Roleplay should be a team effort where everyone gets to have fun, not a one-sided plot.",

From their perspective, they've developed this story with you for two months without knowing how you felt. I've been on both sides of this situation, and can attest that *no one* wants to write with someone who is not enjoying themselves. I know you must see it as a way of offering the benefit of the doubt, the idea that things might get better if you \"stick it out\", but that's hardly ever the case. It also isn't fair to them.\n\nIn the future, be very up front about what you want and how you feel about where the rp is going. That will avoid you feeling pressured to write things you aren't enjoying; it will also avoid your partner from feeling as if they've been strung along. Even if you have good intentions, that is essentially what ends up happening.
