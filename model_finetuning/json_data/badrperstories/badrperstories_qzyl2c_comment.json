Yes, too much of something is never good. Neither light nor darkness. It's all about balance. But hey, if her character wants to believe people turning into sin eaters is good, then let them. Consider her character to just be that type of person. Everyone has their own way of thinking, and sometimes people, so characters as well, have flawed perspectives. Just have fun with it in having your character deal with that, or, just ignore her if you don't enjoy them. I just don't think it's healthy to get that worked up about it, you know.",

            "body": "I'm going to be completely honest, everyone in this situation sounds equally bad. This is a simple case of everyone involved having a different interpretation of the lore. There's nothing *wrong* with playing a character who is zealous and fervent in their beliefs, and that doesn't make them a bad roleplayer, as I get the impression this entire argument took place in-character. Not to mention, if not everyone is playing a WoL, then they would *certainly* not be bestowed with the knowledge that is given in the MSQ, so they would not be privy to the sort of information re:tempering that is revealed to the main cast. It's literally not even public knowledge what *happens* to those who are tempered in Ul'Dah, so your general person would probably have very little knowledge of what overexposure to any elemental aspect does. \n\nAlso, just to nitpick here:\n\n&gt;But she was a Dark Knight (But in her Paladin class at the time), aclass of people who thrives on anger/the pain of others, for their powersource.\n\nThis isn't true. Dark Knights thrive upon their *own powerful emotions*, and harness them to wield in battle. And the strongest emotions come from witnessing (the WoL, as well as the originator of the art) or being subjected to (Sidurgu) great injustices. The label of 'dark knight' wasn't even something they chose for themselves; it was given to them by the people of Ishgard, because they were vigilantes who would cut down temple knights and clergymen who were otherwise untouchable. It's even said in the first class quest that the original Dark Knight took up that mantle in direct response to &gt;!witnessing a member of the clergy do something 'unforgivable' to a child and getting away with it!&lt;. Their spells look edgy and flashy, but they're honestly more 'good'-aligned by default than any other class in the game. It's just that it's way more of a chaotic good than a lawful good like the Paladin.",
