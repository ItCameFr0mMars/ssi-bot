You're dismissive and abrasive with your post to see if your actions can be validated by us. If there is more context to \"show\" us why this person was such an asshole, I'm curious why you don't show it.\n\nHave you thought about why perhaps all your roleplayers are dropping? Wouldn't the common denominator be you? \n\nI recommend taking a step back and a deep breath. If you had a rough day and you might have taken it out on your rpers who may have not gotten to you fast enough or whatever the case may be.",
