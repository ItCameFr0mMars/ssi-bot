I don't think this is exclusive to RP though, it's in all aspects of my life. I think the unique challenge I get from RP while having social anxiety was learning to temper my reactive side and not freak out when I saw partners enjoying other RPs. It took me a while because of my rejection sensitivity but now I can take a step back and let it go. \n\nI also get veeeery nervous when people don't respond to me haha. Which isn't great what with the ghosting epidemic :p",

Mistakes were *made*, ya know?\n\nI recently had to shut down two potential RPs and put a 3rd on indefinite hold because the anxiety was flaring up too much. It's not yall, it's me. No really. \n\nIt sucks too, you can't take an extended mental health break because IRL or anxiety or whatever, or even just \"I'd rather play video games for a few days\" without some entitled asshole screaming \"GHOSTING\" like it's the greatest sin. I hate having to deal with other people's insecurities all the time. People get so angry because they perceive a rejection where really, I'm just busy or tired. Like, the fear of yet another angry blowup from a new RP partner is so profound that I feel *dread* when I just want to do something else today. Which makes me want to log into Discord *less*, and flee it *more*. \n\nI mean damn, I'm online, and it *tells you* I'm in a game. Right? Gotta be rude to expect prioritization of RP responses when I'm shooting pixels right now. Or I have to resort to Offline mode, which eh, no. I'd rather a blowup early than get emotionally invested in an RP or a person, only for them to get possessive down the line.\n\nLike... I've done RP with people I've found inside of MMORPG games. They are part of the culture, they know that love of the game is what inspires RP. Yet, the worst blowups I've had were from obnoxious people found inside an MMO. Dude, I'm farming right now, or dude, I'm an officer and there's a guild event, I reaaaally want to do that instead of hold your hand right now.\n\nLike, I need to get over this anxiety, because current or new partners aren't the same as past partners, **yet**. But like, you get so used to it? Because BadRP is so frequent? And the blowups are so nuts?",

Knowing I owe people replies whenever I don't know when I'll have it in me to write just adds too much anxiety on top of what I've had going on.

Chatting over the internet doesn't make me magically good at socializing.\n\nBUT, if I can make it over the initial hump, then it can be awesome.",

I always have my online status set to 'offline', because I don't like the idea of people knowing when I'm online and what I'm looking at/doing. So it can take me a while to respond to posts or pitches. I've tried Discord RP before, but it didn't work out. And yeah, it does get better once you get to know the person.",
