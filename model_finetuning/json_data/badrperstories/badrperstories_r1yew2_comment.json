If you feel it may cause issues or if you just want a bit of extra privacy, you can just leave it as 'hey, there may be radio silence from me in about a month, so right now I'm looking for something short term. Is that alright with you?\" That way, they know what's going on if you stop replying. However, explaining the situation a bit more without further details, like \"I'm 8 months pregnant\", should be fine as long as you aren't going into specifics and it's not just you dumping personal issues on them.\n\nI've kinda had to deal with something similar. I have an array of mental health issues and general neurodivergency that can impact my ability to RP. For example, I have anxiety. Not 'I get stressed out sometimes' anxiety, but 'I have legitimately thrown up due to pure nerves' anxiety. Sometimes it means I'm stressing over something IRL, or even the RP itself (due to perfectionism), which then means sometimes I'm a bit slow. I apologize if that is TMI itself, but I've found it pays off to be picky-and-choosy about certain stuff. For example, I try to be upfront about the fact that I deal with certain cognitive stuff (learning disability/processing disorder plus autism-related things), as it lets them know that I may make certain errors in the RP and that they're totally allowed to ask me to fix errors and other details in my responses as long as they're polite and patient. However, I've found that when you simply leave stuff like the aforementioned anxiety as something along the lines of 'I'm not feeling good right now' or 'I've been sick for the past week', or 'I'm dealing with something personal', most people will be understanding and won't probe any further. And hey, it's technically true, and it doesn't feel guilt-trippy!\n\nSo, a similar sort of 'vagueness' could work, along the lines of 'I have something personal coming up' or 'I'm currently undergoing medical treatment' or 'I'm going through a major life change right now', This could get the point across, without worrying about potentially oversharing, or being triggery.",

            "body": "Hey, I\u2019m probably not then best to give advice but here we go..\n\nI gave birth to my first daughter May 1st of this year. I told all my partners ahead of time that I was going to be absent for a week or two. They all understood. Man I wish I told them otherwise because once my child was born those weeks turned into months! After a month or two of not responding, when I found the time I sat down and messaged all my partners what had happened, and that I was stopping all my RP\u2019s I literally had no time to write anything. My baby consumed all of my time, even when my fianc\u00e9  had the baby I still didn\u2019t have time because I had a full time job.  They all understood, at least the ones who I\u2019ve been roleplaying with for years and were actually buddies with. The others just left and found others to fill the void I left. Now that my child is 6 months and is slowly becoming more independent I have more time to write so all my buddies said they were interested in starting something new so that\u2019s what we did and it\u2019s been nice since.\n\nTo get to the point. I\u2019d tell them in advance! Because you can lose track of time with a new baby and days turn into months and months into years! If they ditch you that\u2019s on them! You can find someone new when the time is right!",
