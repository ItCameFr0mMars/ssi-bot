            "body": "I'm not really a fan of parody characters, because there are only a few good roleplayers who can pull off characters like that. Even if it's just making fun of the genre or common tropes, there is the possibility that it becomes distracting for the people who are just trying to write a normal scene. Or that nobody thinks it's funny but instead cringy and uncalled for. There is always a high chance that it will be painfully unfunny, especially if not all of the other writers signed up for a comedy roleplay. I would really not advise anyone to make a parody character in group roleplay, unless everyone is doing it (or the mods created an alternative universe for that or something).\n\nBut using a parody character specifically to make fun of other writers, who haven't even agreed to that? That is just gross. Especially if he can't take a hint and doesn't stop when he realizes that some people are uncomfortable with that or don't appreciate this character joining a scene.",

I feel it's a good rule of thumb! Being *actually* funny is a skill you need to hone, much like other aspects of writing.\n\nIn Jason's case, he was a halfway decent start to a comic relief character: he was an overconfident mall ninja played by someone who had some experience with actual fighting and IRL fight choreography (in fact, Bob prided himself on his ability to write fight scenes for this reason). This could have been a fun way of poking fun at ridiculous fight-scene myths in a more light-hearted, not-at-all meanspirited way. But instead, while he did poke fun at general tropes, it was also a lot of 'lol look at this bit this person wrote, isn't it cringy?' more often than not. And, well, the time travel.\n\nI can confirm that Jason did indeed get the discourse about whether he was actually funny or just annoying. A few people did like him, but other people were like 'uh, that's mean?' or 'okay, wow, that's unfunny.'",

Now I don't know how the tone/atmosphere of the general roleplay was, maybe there was more comedy than I'm aware of.

Sure, the culture meant that people sometimes did funky stuff with their posts and insert obvious pitch dark comedy, but the overall premise of 'teens get abducted and are forced to fight for their lives' is played dead seriously.\n\nThat specific scene was more on the dramatic end. As mentioned before, an antagonistic character had tricked the group earlier and a different member of their group left abruptly, resulting in them freaking out and arguing.  Ellie in particular had not only lost friends but two blood relatives (a sister and a cousin, both played by muns) to two of the major villains. This lead to a plotline where Ellie wanted to get revenge on the villains in question but was hesitant due to (initially) being a kindhearted person, which did come up in that thread. While there was a slightly joke-ish dream sequence before they started freaking out, it was otherwise played straight.\n\nWhich played into my ire aside from the time travel, because like, the group is about to split up after a major argument, my character is grieving for her lost blood relatives and wants to avenge them, and then here comes this random bit where a comic-relief character literally runs in and out screaming his head off in a way we're apparently supposed to laugh at. It's just rude, and once again, he could have avoided this if he *read the thread*. Then he'd realize 'hm, maybe I shouldn't interrupt this scene for the sake of humor'. I think the other two scenes were similarly dramatic, too. I know some other people he in-and-out'd were also annoyed.\n\nSo yeah, I agree that Bob needed to work on his comedic timing when it came to Jason, and realize that 'lol random funny' isn't what everyone is looking for when they have scenes in a roleplay where character death is a norm.",
