You're basically just telling him that you're not interested anymore. \n\nIf you would follow him to other platforms to confront him because he already blocked you on the one you where writing on, then I would consider that too much. Just telling him you're not interested in waiting any longer isn't that confrontional in my opinion.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect to much. Either he is really ghosting you, then he will not reply anyway and ignore it. Or he will most likely think 'They didn't give me enough time, I have a real life too, they could have been asking nicely if I'm still interested.' and move on. The chance that he learns something from a simple message like that is really slim. He probably already did stuff like this and got the exact same messages lol",
