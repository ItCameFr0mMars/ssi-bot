For a paragraph or two it's fine, but excessive amounts beyond that are a bit tricky. I won't use the excuse that I'm busy and divide up my available time ( I could ) but it's just more taxing to me then enjoyable which is the opposite of what I want the hobby to be.\n\n2. Excessive usage of basic and standard emoji. None of the partners I've let pass doing this has ever worked out favorably ( I hate how right my gut feeling often is ).\n\n3. Excessive elaboration of medical issues, mental issues, and political issues before we even figure out the plot. I get people want to share but I'd prefer to learn down the line as we write and not out of the gate. If it doesn't concern the writing, leave it out until we bullshit OOC at some point. Small asides are fine if it is to explain some aspect that impedes initial discussion/post times. \n\n4. Texting style OOC or constant misspellings in a introduction and/or the initial discussion posts. I'm harshly unapologetic; whether one likes it or not it comes off as lazy no matter how good of a writer you are when the time comes. To me it's about putting your best foot forward in your first message. Down the line ( as my trend continues ) I have no issues if it dissolves into relaxed meme chatter and casual chatting.",

Playing actually masculine male characters as my mains is very uncomfortable to me because of me being a trans woman (and even Pretty Boys/Bishounens can get uncomfortable for me to write at times.), but a guy being unwilling to write female characters **at all** (and vice versa) will put me off. I'm more accommodating if the person turns out to be trans, however.\n2. Already created, detailed worlds. I'm likely to bail pretty fast, mostly because I feel overwhelmed and that I'm only along for the ride, so to speak, even if I am allowed to suggest my own changes.\n3. Not innocent things being made innocent, such as entirely benevolent pirates. I personally believe this cliche should stay in children's media, though I know not everybody would agree.\n\nAnd also, not exactly a dealbreaker, but I get irritated if I write with people who are only willing to write either straight or queer pairings.

Wouldn't it be more logical if (...)?' is totally fine. I make mistakes and it's nice if people mention it and I can change it. Approaching me like 'Hey, what you did there was stupid as hell. My God, do you know nothing about (subject)? I lost braincells while reading this.' is not something I want to read because of a tiny mistake. Especially if it wasn't really a mistake, and there was just some detail they didn't get or their knowledge about a topic is outdated.\n2. Being too focused on a certain fandom OOC, especially if I don't know anything about it. Talking about a fandom I'm not in for 15 minutes OOC? Totally fine, I love it when people share their interests. Having to talk about it every day for hours, especially if I already told them that I never watched the show and most of the time it's just them venting about 'toxic ships' other fans prefer. Also people that use phrases like 'kill them' 'that bitch' casually when they talk about their slight disagreements with someone and act like the other person is a literal monster, even though it is just a minor disagreement about something fandom related.\n3. people who basically include nothing about your character in their replies. In a reply with 700 words, there will be maybe two sentences about your character which often boil down to 'And Steve was also there I guess.' Instead of reacting to what your character does or says, they will suddenly introduce NPCs who do something and who their character will talk to. So in a way, they drive the plot forward, but it's basically like they're writing their own little story and your character just stands there.\n4. Trying to analyse my personality/wishes and making assumptions about my own preferences when looking at my characters. No, I'm not my character. No, I'm not personally attracted to men just because my character is, or have the same mental health issues. Stop.\n5.

Subverting tropes can be fun...but for example when I'm looking for a roleplay with evil vampires who exploit humans and a conflict between a vampire and a human character, I get really annoyed when someone replies to the prompt, we get along great and then their character is like 'Victor is the cutest vampire boy. He is afraid of blood and actually, most vampires are not violent, it's just a myth created by humans.' Sometimes it's nice when it's not your typical vampire, but in that case I'm actively looking for a typical vampire and not something completely innocent.\n\nEntirely benevolent pirates just don't make much sense when the setting isn't like a children's TV show/book, I agree with that.",

I wanna write OCs and flesh something out. Also people who demand 2-4K characters even in rest periods or when the characters are just chatting ... how. How can you you write that much without it being fully fluff? \n\nFor me, personally: \n\n1. Immediate issues with grammar and spelling, even in OOC. If you can\u2019t tell the difference between your/you\u2019re and that things in plurals don\u2019t use apostrophes (ex: \u201cmultiple roleplay\u2019s\u201d or \u201cmany hero\u2019s\u201d) \u2014 I\u2019ve not been able to write for long with anyone with this tendency so it\u2019s a no for me. \n\n2. Me having to do every single stitch of exposition, world building, NPC usage, etc. It kinda goes along with the whole \u201cI provided a page and you gave me a sentence\u201d thing. If I wanted to do all the work, I wouldn\u2019t have sought out a collaborative partner in the first place! \n\n3. Sneaking kinks in. I don\u2019t personally do \u201clewd based\u201d rp and I\u2019m upfront about this. It\u2019s just not my thing. I\u2019ve had multiple people try and include obvious kinks and they even go so far as to lie and say they\u2019re most certainly not that! Inflating a character is definitely so not kinky. \n\n4. Lying in general. I\u2019m not talking about keeping anonymous or yourself safe. I\u2019ve had people lie to me about their ages, interests, availability \u2014 it\u2019s an instant exit for me, especially if I find out that somebody lies about their age.",

            "body": "1) Responding to my ad with one word/line responses, or responding by asking me a bunch of questions without telling me anything about themselves. I already put down a ton of information about what I'm looking for, please put a modicum of effort into telling me what you're looking for in kind. It's fine if someone says something like, \"before we go any further, do you \\[insert dealbreaker here\\]?\" but I'm not going to spend my time being interrogated by a potential partner when they haven't given me a single reason to think they'd be a good RP partner in the first place.\n\n2) Historical roleplay with all the yucky stuff scrubbed clean. I'm not saying that any roleplay set in the past has to include graphic overtures about all the heinous stuff that happened in that time period, but, I'm gonna be sus if someone wants to do an RP during a time period where heinous stuff happened, and just want to Ctrl+F+Delete all instances of heinous thing from the record, but alter nothing else whatsoever. Like...a lot of these things weren't isolated from the rest of the world, and had major impacts on constructing the historical period this person wants to roleplay in in the first place. (The low-hanging fruit here would be \"18th/19th century USA RP but no &gt;!Atlantic slave trade or colonialism!&lt;.\" I do not possess that level of cognitive dissonance and would be sitting there the entire time thinking, \"How did the capitol building get built?\" \"Who is taking care of the crops on this plantation?\" \"How does 'California' exist?\" \"Upon whose authority was the Louisiana Purchase ratified?\")\n\n3) I don't necessarily mind bed roles *in theory*, but some folks take them way too literally and it's just like, \"my character is submissive so you have to tell them what to do 24/7 and they possess 0 initiative.\" Nah. \n\n4) Probably most controversially, passwords in ads. If I encounter one, it's \"thank you, next.\"",
