The issue was that after we settled on a plot (that I had to come up with on my own), the RP did go somewhere else. I wasn't really happy with it because this wasn't what we agreed on &amp; then he wanted to drop the RP &amp; plan a new plot instead.\n\nI said ''alright, fair enough, but this time we *both* come up with something, to avoid further misunderstandings.'' He agreed.\n\nA week goes by, I share my ideas &amp; he admits that he didn't plan anything again but really likes my idea. Except: ''The place of the RP doesn't make sense. The goal of our OCs in this RP is too big for them'' etc. Funnily enough I chose that place on porpuse because his OC talked about it in an older plot &amp; it also connects with his OCs background story a lot.\n\nSo I got annoyed this time. Not only was I the one doing all the work again, but now my partner also disagrees with everything I suggested. ''I like the general idea of your plot'' he said, when nothing of the general idea was left, because he disagreed with it all.\n\nTold him to actually take some time &amp; to think about what *he* wants, because at this point I was just tired of planning 2 plots on my own, when everything got disagreed on &amp; my partner didn't offer any compromises nor ideas.\n\nSome people really want you to entertain them &amp; knowing magically what exactly they want, even though they don't know it themselves..",

Toss some ideas out yourself. If you're just going to boohoo every idea someone comes up with and nothing more, why even attempt to write with someone?

When I have a plot I want no one input on, I write by myself.\n\nWhat this person wanted from you is a free story. You should have told them to toss the money down for your book if that's all they wanted, then they don't have to do anything at all. Problem solved on their end.\n\nAnd also, I get sometimes someone may have more to bring to the table when it comes to plotting. I've been on both ends of this. Sometimes inspiration and flow hits someone else first. But I can always tell when that is happening and when it's someone who just wants a story they can read over. They'll add something, small details, ideas about their characters, how they're viewing the location or ideas on interactions or the relationship between characters.

They told me, \u2018you do it, i trust you.\u2019 Then i said, \u2018I did some already, i want you to give suggestions to new phrases for once for the next one.\u2019 Then i get \u2018i need you to do it.
