Those that try and push for smut even whenever it's not wanted just cannot fathom the point of roleplay if smut isn't involved.\n\nAt least, the reason I've come to this conclusion is because on more than one occasion, whenever I tell people I'm not looking for smut-centric plots, or I tell a person who's pushing OOC boundaries with me \"I don't roleplay to get off\", their response is,\n\n\"Then what's the point (of roleplaying)?\"\n\nMore than once, I've been asked this. I've also seen this reflected in some of the stories that have come up on this sub. And in fact, whenever I tell someone who's not in the hobby that I roleplay, I often have to explain *its not what you think.* A lot of people, both in and out of the hobby, just seem to think roleplaying is just glorified sexting.",

            "body": "One reason that comes to mind is limited availability of partners. For example, they see that you want to write a specific pairing/ in a specific setting (without smut) that is rather rare. So they think: well, it's hard to find partners for that, maybe I can change their mind and make them include smut. That is the form of pressuring people for smut that I have experienced most of the time. Especially in forums with maybe 150 people in total.  \n\nSome other people just write everyone a private message regardless of their boundaries. They just don't care what their partner wants, they write as many people as possible without even reading their searches, and sometimes they get lucky and meet someone who wants the same stuff. But if they write someone who doesn't want to write smut, they often try to write three messages like 'Why not? Pleeeeease.' and then disappear after you say no often enough. They have probably 30 chats open at the same time lol\n\nA small subset of people who try to force smut are such terrible writers that they have already scared away most people interested their specific topic because nearly everyone has a bad experience with them. Or they searches are so badly written that nobody applies. It might also be possible that their kink is super rare. So they try to cast a wider net by trying to trick writers on other subreddits/forums, who don't know how terrible they are yet. Or that specific thing (vore, feet, transformation) is even a kink. This often happens with people who don't even MENTION that they want to write any sexual content, until you look at their character profile and it includes something like penis length or if their character's privates are shaved. If you mention that you don't write sexual content, they say stuff like 'Oh well, we will see;)' and don't give a clear answer whether they're looking for smut or not. \n\nEspecially annoying are the people who think that including smut is the sign of a 'mature'/'skilled' roleplayer. They think every roleplay absolutely has to include romance, and if it includes romance it has to include detailed sex scenes as well, because that is what couples do together, dummy. Instead of realizing that everyone has different preferences, they try to guilt trip people into writing it. And try to make you feel bad that you don't want to include it in your roleplay, because your prompt is totally their thing and it's mean that you don't give them a chance and change it so that it is more 'mature'. You're an adult, aren't you? \n\nThat are some of the reasons that come to mind.",
