            "body": "These are all personal preference, truthfully, but they might help. As for where to look, I've had the best luck on Discord, Roleplay Meets Reborn in particular.\n\nCut out the explanations of your preferences. For example, being uncomfortable with first-person and not doubling because you find it easier to focus on one story-line, why it's hard to create a plot yourself, etc. It's needless filler and it strikes me a bit odd that you seem to feel you need to justify them all.\n\nThe last sentence in your intro paragraph seems like it was missing some kind of lead-in. Also it's not a super great first impression that the third sentence of your request is judging past partners for how they wrote their character. I'd keep that paragraph to just listing out whatever other requirements you have for partners that aren't covered by one of the categories of your rules.\n\nPut your writing samples directly in the doc rather than linking to another one. Your ad isn't a nesting doll set, everything relevant should be in one place. Bio links can be passed on if someone shows an interest in the fandom, also the couple links I clicked there gave me a 'doc has been deleted' error screen.\n\nList your fandoms all in one place rather than having two separate lists. Also different bullet points for different plot ideas rather than tossing two or three in together.\n\nIf you consistently get asked to write plots/tropes/ships you're not interested in, list them under limits. You don't need to put down every little thing you hate, but if you're turning away a bunch of people over the same thing, might as well save everyone the time.\n\nI'm unfamiliar with the fandoms you listed apart from Marvel, but it seems you only write canon/OC? I would put that at the top of your ad somewhere so people don't read through the whole thing only to find you only write that. It's not bad or anything, but a lot of people aren't interested in it.",

If anything in the RP doesn't go exactly as I want, I'm not going to communicate at all, and I'll just ghost you\n3. I don't double, so prepare to play Canon for my OCs!\n4. I have my character bios pre-prepared, so really this is just you catering to me needs, and me not even adjusting my character to work for any plots you have in mind\n(Note: combined with this, no.2 practically guarantees you ghost any partner who comes with ideas)\n4. If all this actually seems appealing to you - you also need to go read up my character bios in this entirely new link.\n\n\n\nSo here's how this reads:\nA potential partner needs to jump through A LOT of hoops to write with you, and the reward for jumping through all those hoops just doesn't seem worth it, since the ad specifies a lot of demands and almost nothing about what you bring to the table.\n\n\nThis is fine, BTW, it's not a job - you like what you like and that's okay. However, you cannot reasonably expect that this approach to partner search will be popular. \n\n\nWhile I think a lot of the tips on how to improve your ad are valid, I think realizing that if you're going to be a selfish, high-maintenance partner, you're inevitably going to have a harder time finding partners than someone who's innately cooperative and accomodating",
