You also tell your partner how their character has to feel about this - unworthy, insignificant, sad - and that the character can't even realise the relationship is abusive until your faceless crime boss reveals that to them somehow. They can get character progression but only when you choose to grant it to them.\n\nAs far as I can see if someone actually does want to play this sidekick character in the way you are telling them to, the relationship between them and the main hero is of primary importance to them. You say that there will be scenes at the start where the hero and sidekick are working together against the villain and they won't even be able to discover anything about her during these scenes. So they have to RP with themselves the whole of that time, or else you have to play the abusive hero. Either of those is a great shortcut to getting ghosted.\n\nBasically it's not possible for the person playing the sidekick to achieve any RP goals they might have in this scenario. Even if they do want to play a character who is miserable and gets rescued, it's set up such that they can't form a meaningful connection to either the character who makes them miserable (npc/doesn't matter/may be them) or the character they get rescued by (faceless/unknown/only acts through others).\n\nThese are my ideas why this isn't progressing, I'm not implying that you are doing any of this on purpose. This is the result of the prompt, though. If it's someone else's prompt which I think you said, ditch it and come up with your own that considers the agency of your partner.",

            "body": "So this is from me picking at your profile so I'm gonna sound mean here goes.  tl;dr incoming, skip if you're having a bad day\n\n* A lot of the plot is predetermined to play out as others have said, the other persons' comparatively underpowered character gets punted around with their circumstances only perking up once they've played out the aforementioned being-punting and side with your baddie.  There's not a sense of gaining their own agency or power, they have to attach themselves to a bigger fish in the pond after a good 20minute punting session(your character) to survive or really get anywhere.  Some folk might be into that depending but it's a narrower pool.\n* Your username is RPEnjoyerr (I know it's because RPEnjoyer is taken but it reads a little clunky and feels like a typo even if it isn't), that's going to give xxx\\_2000steenagerusername\\_xxx vibes.  It's a writing based hobby and already the first impression is \"the capitals together read kind of awkwardly plus here's a username-was-taken workaround\" for a name that doesn't say much about you/your interests.  rp man, he like rp, if you get my drift.  Kinda barebones.\n* So meanest part incoming: for me personally, looking at the writing samples in older posts this just wouldn't grab me for an IM Rp.  It's kinda barebones/dry and I'm not really sharp enough on writing advice to give pointers on how to improve there.\n* your account is 18+, there's a lot of people that may see that and steer away accordingly because \"person probably gonna hit me up for erp\" whether that's a fair assumption or not.\n* Adding onto that, M4F ads.  If it's with regard to \"I wanna Rp with an irl girl\" and not just the characters, yeah, most will steer clear as that's in conjunction with an 18+ profile banner and feels like it's a prerequisite for erp reasons.  Most in my experience won't erp with a guy that makes it about their gender because 'hoboy here comes the lineblurring/clingy in 3 2 1 boom drama'.  \n\n* Your interactions with other ads.  At least one post in your history where you call someone out on ghosting you in their Rp ad.  Literally nobody likes being ghosted but don't do this.\n* \"*Dang I had a decent ATLA plot but no gxg huh...*\"  like... don't do this shit either.  Person is making an ad for stuff they like, 'aww your ad doesnt have what I want to do' is annoying not cute.  \nDon't go \"oh but we don't have to erp, so I won't push but if this fact conveniently changes your mind I'll just put it out there\" to try and find a workaround for their limit, just leave it be.\n* *If my partner is a female we can discuss about romance but if is a male, romance or whatsoever wont be in. Still 18+ partners please!*  = the girls aren't going to play with you because 'lineblurring imminent' redflag, the guys will go 'understandable have a gud day' and not play with you.  You couple this with 'you ghosted me :(' and folk will redflag for clinger and steer away accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr:** Username and writing style giving the first impression of \"yeah this Rp won't be very good on a technical writing level\", you've told off people that ghosted which is going to have that \"the more you chase the more they run\" effect including to onlookers, some redflags for being a pusher that will make sadsack noises when the person leaves.\n\nI can't say why individual people left/ghosted/whatever as I'm not inside their head but yeah, these would be some reasons people would ghost post first-impression.",

Even when the sidekick is mentioned, it's only in ways that directly relate her to your character. Come up with some kind of side plot or characterization that's solely for the purpose of developing this sidekick. If she doesn't have any agency or purpose outside her connection to your character, that's going to be a turnoff for a lot of people. \n\nThe way things are worded in your ad places the spotlight on your character. The described plot revolves around how the heroes' actions affect her and what she does to combat that, with zero mention of the heroes' personality or motive. The majority of the plot writeup is about who the villain is and what she does. There's twice as much about her than there is about the sidekick, and your character is fully described where the sidekick's description is, in so many words, \"hero's punching bag has a shitty life\". \n\nI think if you add some characterization ideas for the sidekick, explain your future plot/growth ideas, and pare down the description of your villain character, it will look more even and you'll get more hits.",

By no means I wanted to play the big guy to flex on other, in opposite I wanted to see a good realistic story and a character progression and a good story of a sidekick turning from good to bad. Maybe grayish or something, whatever will be fun to write while my character mentors him/her along the way.  To be honest I would love to play the sidekick in this story as well other than mafia boss, Im craving to see the progression and where would it go.  \n\n\nAnd thanks for the suggestion too!

            "body": "There are already a lot of people pointing out the problems with the ad and plot so I\u2019m not going to repeat all that so much as offer my own advice on the plot.  I think that simply turning things down a few notches would go a long way in making it more appealing to potential partners.\r  \n\r  \nMake the abuse less overt than constant beatings and mental torture.  The hero is a very important, central character in this rp so their abusive nature should be in line with their motivations.  Think of Harley Quinn and the Joker.  He does belittle her and can be physically abusive, but he\u2019s not doing it 100% of the time.  He gives her a reason to stay and put up with it.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a romance like Harley and Joker, but the hero needs to give the sidekick a reason to stay.\r  \n\r  \nThe villain is currently way too overpowered to be remotely interesting.  Instead of being the boss of this evil agency, consider making her someone who is trying to climb the ranks or trying to overthrow the current boss.  She can still have a secret power, but just stick to one and run it by your partner.  The villain can also still be somewhat influential and can be more powerful than the sidekick, but ideally, she should also need the sidekick\u2019s help to achieve her goals.\r  \n\r  \nEven if she\u2019s broken down and in denial, the sidekick already knows the hero\u2019s true colors. So the villain\u2019s plan needs to do more than simply showing her the hero is bad.  It should either make her realize she deserves better or lead to the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.  And there needs to be a reason why the sidekick would turn to the side of evil even if she does develop a personal vendetta against the hero.",
