Some people get way too emotionally invested in RP pairings, like, to a disturbing degree. \n\nIt's especially disappointing when you've known them for years and years, and you (mistakenly) assume you're friends outside the RP part of the relationship. Then come to find out, they don't want to so much as speak to you if you aren't supplying them their favorite ship ...\n\nBig ouch.",

Sure, you don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d those things to anyone, but damn that would sting. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior remotely, and it\u2019s probably best to just not interact with this person any longer since I don\u2019t think anything productive will come of it, but as someone who does care about my roleplays as more than an idle distraction, I can understand why they were upset. \n\nAlthough the art thing makes them sound like a jerk. In general, the rule of thumb is don\u2019t criticize someone\u2019s work unless concrit has been solicited. (Although like, you didn\u2019t explicitly say any of the art was RP related, but I\u2019m genuinely trying to imagine a scenario where anyone would draw RP pics for me and my reaction would be \u201cI\u2019m gonna critique this art.\u201d Even if it was MS paint doodles that looked like they were drawn by a five year old, that\u2019s rude AF.)",
