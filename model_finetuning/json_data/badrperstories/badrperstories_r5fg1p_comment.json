There's definitely a lot of \"newer\" role players who think that after 2-5 years, they're the OGs, which is where I was coming from.  \n\n\n I've met a lot of these types who laugh and call me a liar because they don't know that RP's a hobby that predates their birth. Then if I come back with \"cool, I've been writing for 20, what's your point?\" or my partner claps back with how he's been writing for 30+, they drag us because they think it's a \"kid's hobby\" and we should grow up.   \n\n\nAnd respectfully no: RP is half reading, half writing. Both are hobbies people keep for a lifetime, so why is RP given an age restriction?",

            "body": "That part about the mental health issues brings back memories about a guy in a group roleplay I once knew. He would always be incredibly vague ('You don't know what I went through!'/'Everyone in my life disappointed me and abused my trust and I have to heal.'), every time an issue came up. Nobody could criticize him because of these problems, but he never even thought about what other members of the group might have went trough. One time, a girl literally had to have an operation, nothing too serious (just something about her teeth I think) but definitely understandable that she couldn't write for a while, and she told the mods about her absence. He told me that I should remove her from the group because she hadn't done her character profile 'in time', even though he took a month to finish his own character profile and often straight up ignored messages from mods claiming he hadn't seen them. The icing on the cake was that he was always giving advice on how to lead a group and made fun of people being too sensitive...while I knew for a fact that he once just deleted his character and ghosted everybody in another group when a mod said that his character was great, he just needed to adjust his powers a little lol\n\nWhy do these type of people never consider what other people might be going through? They often act like they're the only person who had bad things happening in their past or who anxiety or whatever. Knew another girl who constantly crossed and ignored my boundaries, even when I clearly told her I was uncomfortable several times, and when I distanced myself from because she literally told me that she would keep doing so in the future, she tried to make me feel sorry for her by saying stuff like 'I should just stop trying to find friends and believe in friendship, I always fail.' and things like that. We only knew each other for for four days at most.",

I imagine it's very easy to get trapped in this spiral where it's very hard to see how things come off to other people.   \n\n\nI'm not saying it's at all a valid or okay thing to do, but I've seen it over and over.

            "body": "The mental health thing speaks to me because it reminds me of something that happened some time ago. I won't go into specifics because it's probably going to be a whole story, but the TLDR is that someone I used to RP with had a character who behaved incredibly abusive and bigoted, and none of this was tackled in a super tactful manner. After the mun became less active, the character in question and her scenes eventually came up, and I harshly criticized her for the fact that, hey, this character has 'abusive bigot' as a primary character trait and it's not handled well. It felt like it was for shock, and most of her being an abusive bigot felt like it was more to give her something to angst about rather than the people she's hurt.\n\nThen, *literally a month later,* the mun decided to break out of inactivity to tell me that it's not bad because she (the mun) has BPD, and so did the character! It's an ownvoice! The entire point of that was to demonstrate how people with BPD do shitty things that they know is shitty! She's not being a bigot, she's lashing out against people who are 'happier' than her! She's not supposed to be sympathetic! It's ableism to not acknowledge mental illness! And I don't expect you'd understand BPD, much like I won't understand autism! (yes, I am autistic)\n\nIt was hilarious because she misunderstood the criticism. It wasn't 'this character is a badly portrayed depiction of mental illness', or 'you can't have a character who behaves in shitty ways because of mental illness'. It was 'hey, maybe don't have a character who spends a lot of time being extremely bigoted and violent towards people with disorders like Downs? It's one of those things that is extremely upsetting and uncomfortable, and I was legitimately disturbed that no one saw something wrong with this.' Like, abuse is one of those touchy subjects even *without* the ableist aspect, no matter how you tackle it. *Especially* if you are playing the abuser themselves. And yet, she tried to call me out on ableism... because I called her out on writing something ableist. \n\nWhat's even funnier is that around this time I was writing a character who was an ownvoice of *my* mental illness (autism, MDD, GAD, CAPD, suicidal ideation, trauma, etc.) While this character does behave in shitty ways that have to do with emotional instability, at no point did I ever feel the need to have a scene where, dunno, she shoves people down the stairs to illustrate that mental illness can make you act shittily. Did I have some potentially triggery scenes? Well, yes, but I did warn for them upfront and they weren't just 'oooo edgy bigotry'. So, as someone who was doing something similar at the same time, I kinda called bullshit because, again, from personal experience, you don't need a scene where someone acts horribly bigoted to say 'mental illness bad'. \n\nNeedless to say, I ignored this and just laughed in private.\n\nSorry that this is a ramble! Again, will probably make it its own post someday.",

The context clues sound like it's a new way of saying \"self-insert\" but I just want to make sure I'm reading this right. \n\nJust from the comments on this alone though, it seems that one particular trope is way too common. I know from experience that most role players have some type of disorder, whether it's strictly mental health or if it's a learning disability, most of us RP to escape our norm or otherwise explore it in a slowed down, safer space. And yet, despite the awareness that you can't throw a brick in an RP without hitting someone like that, there's always got to be that one person who thinks only their mental health matters. They're perpetual victims with no accountability.",

For example, someone who isn't white writing a character who is from a similar background using their own experiences and perspective. Or, in this case, neurodivergent muns writing neurodivergent characters. It's not *necessarily* an SI, but it does oftentimes mean autobiographical stuff.\n\nAnd yeah, RPing attracts all sorts of people whose lives suck in some way or another because escapism is fun. It's not inherently *wrong* to tell muns about your issues (I try to be upfront about mine because I'm prone to silly mistakes and wouldn't mind polite direction if I mess up), nor is it bad to write mentally ill characters, even if it's based off your own personal stuff. It becomes a problem when you essentially use it as a 'get out of criticism free' card, like what a lot of people are talking about. Like, going back to my own character, I honestly don't know how I'd react if someone told me she was similarly problematic, but I know something like what this person did wouldn't be the 'correct' response. I did put content warnings where necessary, kept the most triggery stuff in easily avoided solo threads, and asked for critique throughout, but even that doesn't mean that my character was ever above criticism.",
