So many hidden rules that suck all the fun out of it.\n\nThere needs to be less \"my way is the right way\" and more \"I just don't gel with this person, I'll move on.\" Have fun with role-playing, create amazing stories and characters in your own individual manner.

Especially after I tell them no and they bottom-shame. It's bad enough I get that crap on dating sites and it's more often than not an automatic block when it comes to RP.\n\nSo no, no you're not a bad RPer and don't feel guilty for someone telling you otherwise.\n\nThat said, I let my characters develop their relationships naturally, but most usually end up as bottoms or bottom-verse. One of my mains was a top, the guy he got with was a bottom, and somehow the roles flipped with mine being the bottom and his being the top. Another character I write is a bottom, but his brain resident (he's possessed) is a top. I'll write scenes for both roles, but I understand (and feel) that genuine discomfort to write.",

            "body": "Bruh. If there's something that doesn't bring you joy, satisfaction, and makes you uncomfortable to write, then simply do not write it. You're not bad. \n\nIf you don't want write to write as a top or switch, then simply don't. There's no bad in it and ANY kind of person that sees it as a bad thing, can go dunk their heads in a toilet. \n\nOn top of that, you ARE a role player that IS looking to try out different writing styles; characters, and personalities, so that makes you STELLAR in my book. \n\nBottoms can have that uwu submissive shy bean stereotype you mention, but also many role players can be actually very lazy and disguise it as a submissiveness thing. They don't drive the story forward, they don't develop the relationship, and perhaps during the nsfw scenes they pull the '*moans*' card to the lengthy reply their partner has given. I call it laziness. You can have a shy character but still not let the whole weight of the role play to fall on your partner. \n\nIf you don't do those mistakes, it doesn't matter if you're a submissive person, or just prefers writing them. \n\nThe only thing that may occur is incompatibility. A *fellow* bottom might be looking for a top, and that might cause issues. But incompatibility can occur for literally everything else. Literacy, genres, pov style, timezones, you name it. \n\nTLDR: If you're doing your best to drive the story forward, you're not bad. Bottom or not. Sincerely, a fellow bottom.",

In many ways they wouldn't even be wrong.\n\nRegardless of trying things out or not, the only thing I'd also say is do not try to be all things to all people. Exhausting and futile!
