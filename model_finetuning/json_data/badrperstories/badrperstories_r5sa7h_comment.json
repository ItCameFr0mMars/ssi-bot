Echo what's good as a past experience in the character's new timeline. \n\nNo fucks given about reposting/replotting scenarios you enjoyed or had planned with new partners. There's no ownership, no one copyrighted it. \n\nI have a much more difficult time disentangling emotions, though. Good luck there, if you figure it out, let me know. More than once, if a bad enough taste lingers around a character, or game, or fandom, or whatever, my emotions have a hard time going back there without getting jammed.\n\nBest example (feel free to skip): Once upon a time, with my ex-fiance (the 1st one)... I created a few characters for Dungeons and Dragons, and for Pathfinder. We played them a lot, eventually the whole thing was dropped. (I have my theories, but that's a whole other story.) Later, I reforged most of them in SWTOR. Sometime after that, we broke up. Roleplaying some of the characters was easy in some ways, but difficult in other ways. Two of my OCs were originally D&amp;D characters, and in SWTOR, I couldn't ship either worth a damn. I tried, too. Because? They were shipped with the ex's OCs. It was just a bad place for me to go.",

So I ended up doing a 'prequel' with another partner and doing that character's backstory.  It's been awesome, and I love my character even more than ever.  Was it the world you created?  If so, maybe you can set another story in that world!  \n\n2) was it a romantic RP and your partner gave you butterflies?  Honestly, that's probably the hardest kind of partner to get over.  But honestly it's a bit like an IRL breakup.  It will hurt for awhile, and no new partner will ever quite be the same, but you'll learn from the experience, and one day you'll be pleasantly surprised by someone better.  If that's the case, maybe just do some RPing that's less romantic in nature until you find a partner you really like :)",

I do write little snippets of them though just doing their own thing and making new friends in other timelines just for me to read and it's really helped process the whole thing. lowkey traumatizing, it was.",

They were the light to mine\u2019s darkness, and them just coming to hang out oocly, I felt added to how charming their characters were. First one got tired and started doing nothing but dungeons, and second one, I had only 12 days with, before they started just hanging out with their guild. The latter isn\u2019t really \u2018over\u2019 per se, they just don\u2019t really rp and I don\u2019t want to really force them into it. I just stopped playing the game as much and moved onto playing ESO. The rping hasn\u2019t been as good without them, but it\u2019s something.",
