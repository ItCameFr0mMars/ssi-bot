Some people just get swamped with responses almost immediately depending on the time of year and others don\u2019t. On reddit and most other platforms, Notifications are notorious for being silent when you don\u2019t want them to be so you can\u2019t really say it\u2019s an excuse.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re not entitled to peoples time in the same way they\u2019re not entitled to yours. By not answering you, they\u2019re not wasting your time because they\u2019re not implying that they\u2019ll get back to you if they\u2019ve not messaged back at least once. They\u2019re probably just not wanting to get begged for an rp or possibly slandered given some people cannot handle rejection in a healthy way. By being silent, they can\u2019t have people attack them.\n\nDoes it get annoying to not get an answer? Yes. It can be very annoying and somewhat infuriating if you then find they\u2019ve completely ignored it and posted another ad, but in a way that just means the response would\u2019ve been no regardless. You\u2019re not owed an answer right away just because you exceeded the requirements they may be looking for in the post. If anything it sounds like you\u2019re throwing too much at them. Unless it\u2019s requested to have all that stuff you supposedly put in your introductory message, all you need is your age/age range (only if specified, not all rpers request your age to be put in but some will), time zone, availability plus whatever other additional basic info they\u2019ve requested and you\u2019re good to go. Too much and they\u2019ll feel like they\u2019ve basically had a whole rp that\u2019s had every detail planned thrown at them.\n\nNot only that but most rpers have a hidden list of wants that they don\u2019t put on their posts. If you don\u2019t make the cut for those hidden requirements, then you don\u2019t get chosen.\n\nIt sucks but there\u2019s no point getting so upset over it. Finding a compatible rp partner that sticks is a very difficult part of this hobby. I think perhaps you\u2019re coming off too strong in your messages and need to tone it down.",

            "body": "I get the frustration but I work in healthcare, sometimes 10-11 hour shifts. My job does not let me be on my phone, so it goes on silent. Then sometimes I'm so tired from my shift, since I have a physical job that I will not even reply when I get home so then I sleep 7-9 hours so it can feel like an entire day before I can reply to someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen sometimes I get the low effort responses and a few times, even an aggressive reply. I usually don't reply to those. Sometimes I might get swamped with replies as well, so that can slow me down when I'm recruiting for something.\n\nMy rule of thumb is I give someone about 72 hours to respond. After that I move on. It's frustrating but it's the reality of life and the reality of the hobby. Sometimes the tone of your response might impact someone's decision to reply or there could be other factors at play.",

Secondly, time zones exist, people have jobs or even go to school, and cannot check their phone/computer every second, even if the ad is \u201cless than 1 day old.\u201d Thirdly, some people might have their notifications disabled and might not see your message instantly. When I post ads, I often get at least a dozen messages and I can\u2019t respond to all of them in a timely manner, so if someone didn\u2019t get back to you, it\u2019s nothing personal. \n\nIn short, stop jumping to conclusions and thinking you\u2019re entitled to people\u2019s time.",
