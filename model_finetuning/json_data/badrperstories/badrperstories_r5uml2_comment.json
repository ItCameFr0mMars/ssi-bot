Also I don't think anyone's ever approached me wanting a roleplay about a subject they're an expert in, in real life.\n\nMy approach is to research to have an accurate (to my knowledge) portrayal and correct as necessary when I get new information.\n\nHandling things depends entirely on how I'm approached. If someone's an adult looking for a civil conversation, I'll meet them with the same tone and behaviour, and be happy to learn. If they fly into a rage because I made a mistake, I'm gonna block them and move on, and do further research on my own.\n\nMy hard limits are just things that make me uncomfortable tbh. Sometimes that's drastically inappropriate portrayals, but 99% of the time, it's things like explicit abuse or assault.",

            "body": "From my own experience:\n\n\\- Gender of the writers is never something I cared much about. Usually I won't even ask my partner about it, and it makes absolutely no difference to me whether the gender of the writer matches that of the character. I'd advise others do not worry about it too much either! Despite the meme subreddits about men being horrible at writing women or vice-versa, it's not as if it's impossible to write a character of the opposite gender convincingly. \n\n\\- As of knowledge/expertise, that can be a barrier depending on what the other writer wants. If they want to see specific details about something that happens to be their IRL passion? Then sure, not having much experience with that very field might cause issues. Fortunately for me though, this has never been too much of an issue because I mostly write high-fantasy. People don't tend to have much IRL experience with magic! \\^.\\^\n\n\\- Age is something that can make two writers not compatible for a plenty of other reasons if there's a significant gap between them, but I never felt as if writing characters that don't match the age of the writer was much of an issue for me. However, similarily to above, this miiiiiiiiiiight have to do with my preference for fantasy? Sure, I don't have much of a RL experience of being a 300+ years old elf, but neither will my partner. Even if they are older than me IRL.\n\nTo conclude this little wall of text, I'd suggest you don't stress it too much for the most part? If any incompatibilities arise because of generational difference or someone wanting veeeery specific details (that go beyond basic research on a topic) in a field the other has no clue about that could end scenes, but as a general rule I wouldn't say that writing something you are not irl will immediately cause issues. If you want to write men, characters older than your own or professions you haven't studied in detail? Go for it and have fun. :D",

Every person is different, so there's no right or wrong way to do it. \n\nOne of the most influential things I ever read was an anecdote by some male author or another, whose name I have long forgotten. He said he had written a book where the male protagonist would call his elderly mother every Sunday night and have a long talk with her to keep in touch. His editor sent the manuscript back with a note saying that that detail was \"unrealistic\" and that no adult man would do something like that. Unbeknownst to him, the author *himself* did, in real life, call his mother on Sundays to have long talks with her, and had included that detail from experience. \n\nThe breadth of human experience is so enormous that there really isn't any specific behavior that would be 'unrealistic', in my opinion. I would honestly be more shocked if someone said that I had depicted a character wrong based on their gender by writing some behavior or another. \n\nWith regards to time periods or more niche topics, though, I have absolutely felt like this. I distinctly remember role-playing with someone some time ago who had a very specific fixation on one decade in the 1800s in the city of Hong Kong. Their knowledge about that was so detailed, and mine so filled with gaps and not even knowing *where to look to find the information to research it* that I felt really inadequate and had to drop.

            "body": "I can almost always tell what gender someone is irl by how they play their character, but the characters themselves never feel off unless there's some sort of fetishzising going on.  It's not something I really care about.  A good character is a good character no matter who is behind it.\n\nKnowledge/expertise gets me.  I go waaay to far with the research trying to keep up.  Like looking up the specific years some plant made started being imported.  I've watched hours of sword fighting tutorials for one ic practice fight.  And I still feel like I'm coming up short.  I started just letting people know I'm not looking for realism.\n\nAge can be weird.  I'm not really comfortable writing characters younger than their mid 20s anymore unless they're just side characters or npcs.  I don't know why.  It just feels weird now.  I wouldn't really trust a younger person to play an older character who is supposed to be super wise and mature accurately.  As you said, there's a difference in perspective and experience.  But being older doesn't always mean being exceptionally wise and mature.  Some older adults are less mature than teenagers.  Some never grow as people or expand their horizons.  So if a young person is simply playing a person of a certain age, it really doesn't stick out.\n\nAll in all, I don't really think there's anything wrong with knowing your limits as a roleplayer.  There are going to just be things you're not comfortable with in general.  Sometimes those things aren't going to make sense and that's fine.  But I also think that if you want to explore things outside of your comfort zone, then it's good to take small steps and try to be less hard on yourself.  Easier said than done, but the only thing that really helps is finding a way to care less about how you're perceived and to trust people when they say you're doing a good job.",

            "body": "As far as the gender concerns go, do you feel this way about your male partners who write women? If you aren't scrutinizing their characters or perceiving them as somehow fraudulent, then I think there's reason to believe they would be doing that to you.\n\nThis entire conversation is kind of funny to me, since I see gender as an invented social construct, and if you say someone is a man and they do...*anything*, who am I to say \"no, that's not how men act\"? There's as many ways to be men as there are men on this planet. That's not to say that one ought to completely ignore the social contexts which may define masculinity and which men are brought up in in a given society, for example, the concept of/pressure to \"be a man\" is one I would imagine most men in a society with codified roles for men have at least a proximal relationship with, even if they choose to reject that framework in preference of something else, so feigning complete ignorance of gender roles/outside pressure may come across as...weird. But yeah, if any galaxy brain came at me like \"men don't act like that,\" my response would be \"according to what authority?\" One might be able to make the argument of \"that would not be perceived as masculine in the character's cultural context,\" but *man* is not the same thing as *masculine*.\n\nAs far as age goes, you and I might be on different wave lengths, but in many ways I'm far more interested in playing older characters, not younger ones (always have been.) Even my occasional younger character keeps getting older in terms of how low I want to go. While I can definitely remember the rare occasion of someone who clearly didn't know how to roleplay an adult in a believable manner (unless I was intended to believe this person was a walking train wreck,) for the most part, get old enough and you'll realize grown, independent adults are quite capable of being petty, childish and annoying. The problem isn't necessarily \"no adult acts like this\" at a certain point, and more \"I would rather eat a bag of nails than continue to roleplay with a character who has the emotional maturity of my least-favorite coworker.\" \n\nI probably wouldn't play with someone 10 years younger than me, though. That experience gap is difficult to bridge. I don't know if it would get less prominent as I got older, but 10 years younger than me is like, college-aged, and that's a pretty dramatic difference in terms of life experience. Also, just personally, I get skeeved out when young RPers contact me, not because they're skeevy, but just because...as the precocious kid who always wanted to play with the big kids, I can't not project all that baggage onto them, and uh, word to the wise, not everyone on the internet is nice and has your best interest at heart.",
