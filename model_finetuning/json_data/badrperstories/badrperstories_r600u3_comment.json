Pictures, formatting, etc.\n\nOne time I came across a thread that had *stolen* my entire thread. Like, it was the formatting, but not only that. She\u2019s VERY clearly ripped off my style of writing. Some of her rules were identical to mine (and these were not generally one or two word things, I wrote full sentences and she\u2019d used them directly or changed only a word or two. The only thing she\u2019d bothered to change extensively was the plots themselves, hilariously.\n\nIt was a little creeped out, to be honest. I\u2019d never spoken to this girl before and it sorta felt like she was pretending to be me. I try to put some personality in my posts. \n\nI politely called her out on it, and she was like \u201cyou don\u2019t own this formatting or words\u201d and while that\u2019s true, it\u2019s just. . . Creepy.\n\nSo maybe she meant that? We\u2019re her limits only a few words or were they more detailed, full sentences?",

There was no special formatting (I have seen the same format all over the group, I think most of it was just the standard format people use there), and nearly all of her requirements/limits were pretty common stuff, like the stuff which I listed in my post. So things like 'Discord or whatsapp' or 'no fade to black when it comes to sex or violence', 'I want this to be fun for both of us' and stuff like that. A lot of it sounded like the common phrases you hear when you learn how to write an ad. Maybe one of her requirements/limits was more unique, but it was hardly something I never heard before, and  I could imagine phrasing it in exactly the same way accidently if I had the same requirements.",
