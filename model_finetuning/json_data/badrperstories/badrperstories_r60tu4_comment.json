            "body": "If you roleplayed in a fandom, it's really tricky to make other people interested in characters that are not fandom-related. I think that is especially tricky if you roleplay as yourself. On the one hand, it's a red flag for a lot of people. Because if I let my character insult your character, I also insult you, in a way. And that is really something I would like to avoid, because if people write themselves, they're often a lot more sensitive when it comes to stuff like that. Even though I might think 'Hm, it's only natural that this person wouldn't have a positive reaction when they see what (your character) does.' but I will hold back because I don't know how you will react because you could take it personally.  On the other hand, a lot of people want to interact more with their favourite fandom characters, which makes it hard for people writing OCs (or themselves) to find someone to write with in general. Being not interested in romance is another point where people might be like 'Nah, that isn't for me.', and for many people shipping is a central part of roleplaying, which again reduces the amount of potential partners you could have.\n\nIt doesn't have to do with you with you being annoying.\n\nIn many group roleplays I was a part of, I was welcomed with open arms. In others, I was completely ignored and nearly nobody found my characters interesting. Same with 1x1 roleplays. Sometimes, you get three people who say that they're interested, and they all leave without a word of goodbye during the planning phase. That is just the reality of roleplaying. And if people ignore you/ghost you, it's always a bad idea to leave nice comments under their starters, it seems a little passive aggressive. There isn't much to gain from that. Ghosting isn't nice, it's rude, but doing that will almost never be viewed in a positive way by the other person. If someone ghosts you, the chances of getting a response is almost always zero. So I wouldn't bother, honestly.",

There are so, so many roleplayers who absolutely will not interact with self-inserts (when the writer is also the character). I am one of them. It's nothing personal and I'm not going to tell people they shouldn't do it, but a lot of roleplayers have had bad experiences with these.\n\nAdditionally, it does put a little more onus on the person writing the canon character. The self-insert is on the receiving end of the wish-fulfillment spectrum. Some people are fine with this! It doesn't make someone a bad roleplayer to ask for it. It just means you are going to get significantly fewer bites when you reach out.\n\nTLDR; it was almost certainly nothing personal; it was just a matter of what you were looking for.
