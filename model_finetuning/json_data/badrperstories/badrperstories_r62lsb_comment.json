Like, I can't help fix something if I don't know it's broken, dude.\n\nIt's honestly amazing at how many roleplayers seem to think the other person should be a mind reader. Like, no. I'm not going to assume they feel one way or another about things. If nothing is said, nothing is brought up, what else can I assume except everything is peachy?\n\nI read so many posts/vents/etc where folks complain about their writing partner and it turns out there was zero communication. No attempt was made to bring up issues with the other person. Instead, things festered till they exploded.",

Oh, how wrong I was.\n\nIt was just funny because I changed my username on that platform, so she didn't notice that she was ranting to a person that knew the truth about how much effort she puts into planning her roleplays. \n\nAnd I know that other people had similiar experiences with her in the planning phase and it wasn't just a case of her not liking the roleplay but being too shy to say anything or something like that.",

            "body": "&gt;If someone can't contribute to the plot and have a discussion, rather than a few choppy exchanges of 'Yeah that's fine. Or 'I'm cool with whatever.' then I'm gonna have a bad time and just cut my losses now.\n\nGood. That's exactly what I'd do. I see that initial discussion/brainstorming phase as the equivalent of a casual coffee date. If there's no chemistry, no oomph, no excitement while you toss ideas back and forth (which is often the *best part* cuz it's alllllll speculation), then there sure as hell won't be in the actual writing. No sense in pushing a boulder up a hill all by yourself. Drop 'em and move on. I'm sure it can be frustrating, getting your hopes up, especially when it's a niche fandom you're having trouble finding partners for, but look at it this way -- if you're only getting flat, one-word, low-effort answers *now*, what makes you think their writing will be any different?",
