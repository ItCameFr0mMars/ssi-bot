The good news is they were never your friends, so the loss of their company form your life is only s good thing. \n\nMaria though is actually worse. This is someone who inserted themselves into drama under the guise of helping. But their actions indicate that actually they just wanted the drama and for it to be as about them as possible. Your story shows that they straight up alpha'd Jaz and Clary as a new member of a group and they didn't do it with kindness, they weaponised the information you gave them. Maria only fell on your side because of that and it would be a mistake for you to assume differently. Case in point, once you had no more use to them they straight up dropped you. This is someone you should avoid categorically. \n\nSorry you had this happen to you. This is really rubbish sounding and it makes sense that it would still upset you. I hope you have been able to move on and make good stories since",
