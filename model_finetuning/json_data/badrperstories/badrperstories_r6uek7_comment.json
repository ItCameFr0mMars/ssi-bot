These are not mutually-exclusive states. I'm not even saying you have to care. I'm saying that someone behaving poorly isn't evidence they aren't suicidal. Many people who are in a mental health crisis will exhibit behavior that you will not find sympathetic, rational, comfortable or convenient, and while you are not obligated,--and, more importantly, nor are you *equipped*,--to help them, withholding mockery of someone who could very well be experiencing a severe medical problem is the least you can do.\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying I *definitively know* this person is suicidal. My point is, I can't know, **neither can you**, and the benefit of being right and getting to dunk on them in a subreddit, prize of all prizes, is not worth the price of being wrong. \n\nI hope you find your own means to work through the wrongs that have happened to you in the past, but I'm not going to be party to accusing someone of faking a mental health crisis where the price of being incorrect is a human life.
