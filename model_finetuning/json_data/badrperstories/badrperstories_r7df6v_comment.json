It's like my brain can't let go of the thing I thought we had already decided, and going back and reorganizing my train of thought around the different thing just ... really irrationally upsets me. It's a thing I know I'm bad about, and have to work hard not to let show with people who I know are just, like, living their lives. \n\nI've learned to just say okay, I need a little while to process this, and step away for a bit and talk myself down, but it feels really silly honestly to have to have those \"you are an adult, please do not forget this fact\" kind of conversations with myself lol. It's good you recognize that you're getting in your own way sometimes. \n\nHowever, I do think it sounds like your partner might be running over you just a little bit, especially since you've approached him about changes you'd like to make and he's acknowledged them and then (probably accidentally) disregarded them. He probably thinks you're consistent going-along-with thing means he's doing what you want. It might be worth having another conversation with him and being honest about your feelings. There's not much to be gained from sitting back and building up a bunch of resentment.",

            "body": "I know the feel about this. My last partner would write in actions for my character to propel and support progression for theirs. At first it was mild and I let it go, but the context for some scenarios and various AUs, she would have them do things that is completely OOC for them.\n\nTo me, I do find it disrespectful if someone takes control over another person's character without a discussion about it prior; There's been a fair share of past rp partners who did this to get what they want for their character and in ways that pretty much butchered the core theme of the character they \"borrowed\".\n\nIt's also understandable that you're frustrated. RP is a collaborative effort and it should be fun for both sides. But if he is not showing any effort of meeting in the middle, then of course you're frustrated. \n\n&gt;I get the final word on their design, but I'm trying to be a good partner and give him plenty of leeway to shape them and the story how he wants, too.\n\nI used to do this. When you're a world builder and set designer, you're juggling something like 7 tasks at once. You set the laws and cultures of a section or various sections of the world. You plan rough outlines of the history, the politics, the connections of all of that to the characters in the story and you try to do it in a way that is interesting and inclusive to the characters of the story. \n\nThis brings us to this: there are 3 segments. Your characters, his characters, and the shared setting. The shared setting should be your middle ground. You both get a say in how the story progresses and how it is written. But from what it sounds like, he's stepping over the line you're trying to set. You asked him if the posts can be shorter and you told him you'd like more control over your side characters. He agrees it to but does not change his actions. It's no wonder you're frustrated.\n\nOP, you're valid to be feel frustrated. Sometimes you should take a break for a few days from an ongoing rp; it helps with preventing burnout and refresh your head about the situation. It would also help to be open to a conversation with him about how you feel about it with the goal being to improve the rp for you and him. If you're going to compromise with him in the ways that you have, you need to be able to compromise with yourself about maintaining your boundaries too (not just how much you would give).",
