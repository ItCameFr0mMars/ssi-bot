Sometimes just writing personally for yourself can make things better. It keeps you creative and occupied and allows you to recharge the battery of writing for other people. And after a bit I found people that ultimately worked out well with me! I'm in numerous rp groups now and while they may not be the most active we're still rping and make things happen! I'd say give yourself a break and get your creative juices out to yourself so you can perfect your work and discover more ideas that you like. That's just me however. Never give up hope and if you need a break, go for it!",
