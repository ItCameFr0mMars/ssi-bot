            "body": "When you talk with someone about post frequency/ghosting with a future partner, it's very important to be precise. Some people might think 'one day of no replies when they said they would write every day=ghosting', while others like me think 'It's only ghosting if they are either gone for weeks without warning, or if they begin to totally ignore my messages for a longer period of time or block me.' Same with stuff like saying you're 'active' but it's okay if people are sometimes busy. Everyone has a different interpretation what that means, so it's best to say 'Hey, it might be possible that I will gone for one day, my network is sometimes bad. Please don't worry when that happens, I will be back soon when it occurs.' or ask them 'Do you want daily replies? I might not be able to be online every day, I aim for daily replies but some days I'm not able to write a reply or write a message in the chat, are you fine with that?' There is something that often gets commented on this subreddit as well, and that is stuff like 'You can always at least write a message in the ooc chat, even if you're busy.' And although there are reasons why people can't do that, many people do take it for granted and get upset about it.\n\nLet's say you're are a roleplayer who wants daily replies. I bet you'll met a bunch people who promise you to do just that, and then suddenly the next day there is a 'network error', and the next day they had a migraine, and the following day had a busy day. While that is completely fine, it can also be just excuses, and in the end you were promised daily replies, but end up maybe being able to write once a week, which is not what you wanted at all. If you mention that to them, they might even get angry and say stuff like 'Is it wrong that I have a real life? You're so pushy, it's unbelievable.' as if it is your fault that you want people to do what you both agreed on. If you're especially unlucky, people tell you about network errors and illnesses in the beginning, you're understanding, and suddenly: ghosted. People who made a lot of bad experiences with behavior like that might be like 'Nah, I'm not going to do that again. It is better to cut my losses, they already seem unreliable.' Especially if they're still at the beginning of the roleplay and they can't trust you yet. Yes, it might be an overreaction or seem unfair...but some people just made very bad experiences in the past and  I can't really blame them for wanting to limit the risk of ending up with a unreliable partner again. It might be unfair for you because you really had an issue with the network, she shouldn't have accused you of ghosting straight away, but I can still somewhat see where she's coming\n\n from.\n\nIf she gets that upset about you missing a day and you don't see the issue, then there is a good chance your post frequency wasn't a good match to begin with. It's probably for the best that you noticed it early on (or did you write for months already and that was the first time this happened?). My advice would be to be very clear about what you expect when it comes to post frequency, and if you're unsure how 'forgiving' your partner is when it comes to that ask them. Maybe it will help you avoid people who are too strict. I don't think you did anything wrong btw, this is just an attempt at explaining why some people might react like that.",
