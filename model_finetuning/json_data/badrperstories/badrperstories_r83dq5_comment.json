To be honest, this is one of the reasons I tend to stick to canons and fandom only - you know what you're getting into character wise (with a little development and variation based on players own experiences and whatnot) and so does your partner. \n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly you're answering ads, expecting them to a) have the whole thing mapped out, but also b) not so mapped out that you can still build your character, whole cloth, on the fly?

There are a lot of ups and downs, and sometimes, you start a romance with the best intentions and the characters still don't always mesh.\n\nThink about it from their perspective: they may or may not have a character they want to play. Maybe they have several they might choose from. That is often not the point of this question. They want to know who this person is who has answered their ad. What are they interested in writing, what kind of characters are they playing, what is their idea of a \"personality\", etc. It's part of the vetting process, and you're impeding that process by not bringing something to the table. If you share a character, and then later realize that your characters might not be compatible, then you can address it when that point comes up. There's some give and take involved.\n\nSomething you might try is putting up an ad, specifically advertising that you want to make a character suiting a writing partner's needs. But when you answer an ad, you should eithee be ready to answer some questions, or be able to shrug it off and move on to the next ad if this is something you're not willing to bend on.",

What I'm complaining about is people who want to decide whether I'm a partner worthy of investing in based on a character sheet they're forcing me to develop blindly, especially in terms of a prepared plot/world. I'm not complaining about having to make a character or having to have ideas. It's the opposite.   \n\n\nIf someone makes a post about wanting a small town romance with enemies to lovers, then refuses to tell me which character they want to play or how they want the romance to play out unless I show them a character, then they're creating their own discontent.",

            "body": "I definitely feel your frustration on this. Like you, I tend to tailor each of my characters for a specific roleplay or storyline, and I don't really keep a \"stable\" of pre-made characters to choose from. In fact, I've found that my attempts to play with folks who do tend to fizzle out, because I feel like I'm on some dating show and they're presenting characters for me to ooh and ahhh over, but I'm like, wait, but what's the story? What's the situation? Why should my character be interested in yours? Let's start with the nugget of a story idea and then expand from there.\n\nMaybe it could help to come at it from an archetype angle? Or a certain kind of dynamic in the pairing, or simply a trope, and then fill in the blanks as you go. To use an analogy, you at least want to know what kind of meal you're making before you start throwing in ingredients.\n\nAlso, as a sidenote, I really hate coming up with character sheets on the spot. Every time I've tried making a character sheet *first*, the RP has fizzled out. I'll come up with a concept, a rough outline, maybe an image or two, but it's not until I start writing the character that he or she \"comes alive\" and then I can get a real feel for them. So I like to make character sheets after the fact, once I have a few things to throw on there, but that probably comes from my \"pantser\" mentality.\n\nI think it just comes down to preferences and styles, and everyone having their own particular way of doing things. None of 'em are \"right\" or \"wrong,\" really, just different, but the trick is finding a partner whose style complements yours.",

A character starts somewhere. Some people might prefer to round out the character before ever using them in a roleplay, and some use the roleplay as the place to round them out. Even though these days I mostly re-use from characters I've created, every one of those characters were originally from scratch *for* a specific roleplay.\n\nSo, yeah. I can totally don't want a disposable character that's lacking depth either, but just because a character is going to be created for a certain role or one off roleplay does not mean they're going to be lacking in depth.

I've got a long term partner with I'm writing with now that all of her characters have been made on the fly for our roleplays, and they are absolutely awesome characters. We *get* invested as the roleplay goes along. They certainly don't feel disposable, if the roleplay actually is going... I don't think my partners characters who were created on the fly for a roleplay feel disposable after the roleplays been going for 3 years.\n\nBut. That's writer to writer. Everyone has different experiences.\n\nAnd I'm also not a fan of character profiles. Never have been. Be it a character I'm re-using, or a character I'm making on the fly. I don't really care to see them from my partners either (although they can make one if they want, it won't bother me). But, then again, I also work from plots that kind of call for a certain kind of role, so if someone is hitting up one of my ads, or vise versa, so a character profile just doesn't feel necessary. (I only do 1x1's. I know you mentioned forum roleplays. This is just my experience)\n\nETA: I can agree that a premade character has more potential for more depth... But, my moral of the story is: a good writer can make it happen. A good writer can sell a bomb ass character with good dialogue and good story telling, and can sell you on depth even if the character is still in 'production' stages.",

But what stands out to me here is the refusal to have a dialogue until the character sheet has been produced. \n\nI'm perfectly fine with not wanting to begin the actual RP until both writers have developed a quality idea of who they're playing and somehow assured their partner of that. I'm fine if that assurance is through the production of a character sheet. But I'm with you that the unwillingness to discuss the world you're presumably entering into together through the ideation portion of the creative process is BadRper behavior. It strikes me as laziness and an unrealistic hope that if this applicant produces a character, without any input from me, that I'm attracted to, then it will all be easy and I won't have to work to keep up with it.  \n\n\nJust to add my two-cents (probably worth even less) to the on-the-fly versus pre-made debate, I believe a good character fits organically within the world in which they live. They have a relationship with that world that has helped to shape and mold who they are. I can see how pre-mades work perfectly fine within a fandom world that doesn't change from RP to RP. But for anything original a pre-made either has to be molded to the new world (in which case it's not really pre-made) or won't be completely congruent.",

It's a matter of what you like doing. But eventually someone's going to have to reveal some cards to get the game going. Can't tailor-make an OC to a non-existant OC, it just doesn't make sense. Someone's got to make the first move. \"Ok I have a concept like so...\" \n\nBut yeah, it gets tiring always making the first move. It feels like you have to guess what the other person's going to like or react positively to. Without any clues, too. I'd guess they feel that way, too. \n\nI see two people in this scenario that need to tighten up their communication. And learn to move on if it's incompatible.",

I love both characters dearly and will never forget them or the process it took to create them. I think it completely depends on how deep you're willing to go when it comes to creation. Even the small things can make your character more real. I will do stupid things like take a personality quiz and answer how they would answer, then put the result on my sheet.\n\nI'm not saying that people will always go the extra mile when creating a character, but if you're responding to a prompt I would hope it means your creative juices are flowing and you already have an idea of what type of person you want to put into the roleplay. Though I would NEVER expect someone to have an OC ready and would allow them as much time as they need to create one to their satisfaction. It's a collaborative effort and both people need to be happy with what they're bringing to the party. Excitement towards the RP in its entirety is the key, not necessarily how much time you've spent with your character.",
