I understand how adding exclamation points can convey to the other person that you're really into their ideas!! And you're excited to start!!! But it also feels fake to me and its a little burdensome to project a persona just so you won't get ghosted. \n\nIf you don't like being high-energy in OOC, maybe you can make up for it with your profile, ads, and initial responses? Make sure your Reddit post history (or whatever website you use to partner search) is chock full of plot ideas, roleplay samples, etc. Show people that you are creative, you do have energy to write long responses, etc. When I ask people questions like this person did to you, what I'm doing is feeling them out to see if we're compatible, but if I already got that by looking at their post history this becomes less important to do.\n\nNow, when you say you gave a short explanation... There's a big difference between \"I thought it was cool\" vs \"I'm really into the medieval thing and enemies to friends is always fun.\" The second example is short, but at least you're demonstrating that you read the ad and you like what they like. I know it can be hard, talking to new partners is very emotionally draining after a while, but putting a little extra effort when you first meet someone can go a long way, and you can ease back into your normal chat style as you become comfortable with each other.",

But, I also kind of expect whoever I'm writing with to be mature and professional enough to not take lack of overt expression as a redflag of lack of interest.\n\nSome things don't come as natural to me in speaking to someone over messenger just as they wouldn't come natural to me whenever speaking in person with a group of friends.\n\nThe contents of what I have to say should matter more than if I deliver it with a ton of !!! and happy emojis. If I'm interested in a roleplay, I'll express as much with verbal feedback, not with trying to force myself to present myself in a way that isn't natural for me. If someone thinks I'm too stoic, and that's off putting... We're just not a good fit. Just as if someone irl thought I was too stoic-- Again, we wouldn't be a good fit for friends.\n\nAlthough I guess my whole point is I'm very against your mindset of \"You shouldn't be roleplaying if you can't do 'x'.\" Because yeah, lemme just stop this hobby I've been doing for over a decade because I can't meet someone's standard of what's acceptable expression of enthusiasm.

            "body": "So you're saying.\r  \n1. Showing excitement in text form when you are not expressive of emotions is not genuine.\r  \n2. You're very careful about your tone.\r  \n3. A mature and professional role player does not look for indicators of lack of interest, I.E... Incredibly slow response times, lack of enthusiasm, lack of positive language, or passive-aggressive language.\r  \n4. You've been roleplaying for ten years (Not relevant. An argument from experience is a logical fallacy and constantly perpetuated by the roleplay community as an indicator of writing or roleplay skill.)\r  \n\r  \nI did not say you had to express your excitement in emojis and constant exclamation points, but that is a good way of doing so. Here's what I said.\r  \n\r  \nMe- poorly written. \"Not being excited about new plots or starting new rps sounds like you shouldn't be roleplaying at all.\" This could be taken as a forever statement or it could be taken as conditional as I meant it.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nPremise 1. Fun roleplay/writing comes from inspiration.\r  \nPremise 2. Inspiration creates excitement. \r  \n\r  \nConclusion: If you do not have an excitement about a particular plot or idea or partner, you should not be writing it out because you will not be having fun and the purpose of roleplaying is to have fun.\r  \n\r  \nYou reframed my argument in a way that was disingenuous. I meant if you weren't excited about the idea or the plot or the partner, you shouldn't be roleplaying (in that specific instant.) \r  \n\r  \nAlso, I agree showing your excitement or passing along the occasional compliment is possible without being inauthentic or constantly emoji and exclamation points or being inauthentic.\r  \n\r  \nAnother question. If you consider every long-term roleplay, a project, and collaboration between two or more people. Do you want to kid in your group who never expresses his emotions and never has enthusiasm or lots of fuck eyes and too many ideas and too much enthusiasm?\r  \n\r  \nI'd choose the second any day, but that's a matter of preference.
