I enjoy it. Wouldn't say that it's purely for my sexual gratification, but I do adore writing my smut scenes and exploring kinks both myself and the partner find fun.\n\nI like to view it as similar to other RP preferences. Some people will want romance, some people will want high-magic fantasy stuff, some people will want sci-fi stuff, some people will want historical war settings... and some people will want to write sexual scenes in a setting of their choice. Some writers will love these things and want to exclusively write RPs including those, some will find them boring and/or deal-breakers.",

            "body": "I honestly don't understand why people are so confused about smut. Especially from those who claim to value creative writing, character development and deep topics, it feels like such a big wasted opportunity.  \n\n\nI often think of a comparison; smut in a lewd story should be addressed the same way as combat in an action RP, or relationship banter in a romance story; it's a scene in which two characters are acting, and as such it can convey just as much awesome stuff as any other genre this is applied to.  \n\n\nCharacter development? Show a fearful, introvert person experiencing intimacy for the first time. Describe how their muscles slowly relax through the amplex, discovering the unfamiliar embrace of love they have lived unaware of for so long. Have their partner be their foil, a more experienced lover that doesn't understand the meaning of such hesitation. Have them talk about it, it'll show their personalities.  \n\n\nWorldbuilding? Have the way people address sex showcase a region's culture and customs. Maybe a population of strict and busy military who always need to be on work will mostly have standing sex, and they won't be very concerned about feelings, dismissing it as merely a way to fulfill their human needs so they don't bother them on duty. On the other hand, for a complex and layered matriarchal aristocracy, the first night together is a very important moment that is planned for weeks, an unspoken test in which the man's ability to please his woman. Show the cultural shock of a person from the military dudes having for the first time to worry about the effort they put in sex as they have their marriage arranged with a woman from the nobles. Their fears of inadequacy, that fish out of water feeling as something you've always seen as trivial turns into something your reputation, and that of your people, could depend on. Will they fail? Their bride will gossiping about it will lead to a recurring joke about people from his kingdom being wimpy and lacking virility.  \n\n\nMagic design? Don't even get me started on how cool and fun it is to implement spells and charms into a society's sex life, just the same way as it is to apply it to day to day tasks and life - which, may I remind, sex is part of. Aphrodisiac potions, spells that enhance virility, being able to love each other while flying. There's a world to be explored.  \n\n\nA lot of people often draw a very hard line between erotic bits and \"everything else\". I often see lewd RP ads going on about how they want a fine balance between \"content and smut\", without realizing that smut IS content. Now, I don't live under the illusion that smut could be easily accepted as just another genre just as easily as action or comedy, but it's honestly a shame, and a big missed opportunity from an artistic standpoint, seeing just how often people dismiss sex scenes as just sporadic, irrelevant bits that horny people jerk off to and then it's back to the plot.  \n\n\nAnd of course, if someone forcefully brings smut into your police crime story, it's a bad thing because they're mixing in a whole new kind of content and breaking the promise of genre, not because either style is inherently inappropriate for writing. Again, just as if someone suddenly turned a romance story in a Terminator-esque bullet galore.  \n\n\nAlso, busting a nut to ERP feels REALLY good. It's like a porn, but you and your partner can write it step by step to make it fit your tastes and kinks perfectly! What more could anyone ever ask for?  \n\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

            "body": "sexual gratification can be an aspect of why people ERP, but it usually isn't the only reason when you're talking about high quality RP (not the \"i fuk you hard\" type RP).  If you only wanted that, why not just watch regular porn. But no, people do it because they can be creative, it humanises the characters, because you are not held back in any way, and for some it's just plain fun. Generally, if the erotic writing is good, it's no surprise that it stimulates the biggest sexual organ - your brain.\n\nYou can't also boil it down to just sex, because some writers are more plot/romance focused and only insert sex scenes when required. Others make it the focal point of the story. Believe it or not, you can really explore a character's feelings and psyche through an ERP scene. The desire for another person, and ones innate sexuality are very human things, so to omit it entirely means you're missing out on a fundamental aspect of the human condition. As for the people who put more emphasis on sexual gratification, perhaps they are exploring things they cannot do, or are too afraid to try in real life. IMO, it's easier to do this through the vessel of a fictional character. Plus, a big appeal is that your partner writes something personalised to your desires, and vice versa, which to be honest is better than some generic porno.",

            "body": "In my experience, most people write ERP because sex is part of character relationships and character development. \n\nThere\u2019s a tendency for *some* people to assume its only purpose is sexual gratification and view it as dirty or unnecessary, even though that\u2019s rarely the case. Even in \u201creal life\u201d, sex is still handled as a taboo topic, or something that\u2019s naughty or embarrassing to talk about, which often prevents open and honest discussions about intimacy. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that a lot of people have negative experiences with people not handling ERP as a human experience and just as a way to get their rocks off. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but it isn\u2019t why I personally write it and I wouldn\u2019t be interested in writing it for this purpose. So, I can definitely understand why anyone would feel cynical and distrustful of ERP if they\u2019ve had multiple experiences like this. It would be hard to believe that there are people that have more layered or complex reasons for enjoying it. \n\nBottom line is: one should write ERP if they don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker for me because I don\u2019t need it, but I prefer writing with people who are comfortable exploring every facet of a relationship if we\u2019re writing a ship - and sex is (typically) a significant part of a relationship. For some of my characters it\u2019s more important because of who they are and how they approach the world, as well as the relationship itself. It\u2019s always character building for me, because the characters are the reason I write in the first place. If it\u2019s meaningless and there\u2019s no purpose or complexity behind it, I lose interest. \n\nI want to point out that I\u2019ve also been kind of traumatized by someone who used our characters and shipping as an outlet for her own desire for a relationship/intimacy. Every time she felt conflicted about her sexuality, she shamed me oocly for smut she\u2019d asked to write. When she felt \u201chorny\u201d and okay about sex again, she\u2019d flip our serious and nonsexual scene and want to randomly be kinky. This blurred line between fiction and reality *really* made me uncomfortable, especially because she was projecting what she was doing onto me and accusing me of using it for my own gratification. \n\nSo yeah, if you don\u2019t want to write ERP then don\u2019t - but don\u2019t assume that other people have nefarious or disturbing reasons for writing it just because you don\u2019t personally understand why they do it. There are other reasons, and most RPers have clear boundaries between themselves and their characters.",
