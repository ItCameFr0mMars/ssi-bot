With that said however, I believe the best thing you can do is to be upfront with them and express your feelings. Be specific about it as well, and communicate with them clearly that they have raised too many redflags to allow for this RP to continue. Perhaps talk with them on a new idea? If that doesn't seem plausible, then it is probably best to cut ties and move on. There are plenty of other individuals looking for good RP out there and I'm sure you'll find many!

While being told is no picnic either, it at least gives them a chance to understand why you don't want to continue and a chance, if they so choose, to try to improve their writing or fix mistakes.\n\nThat being said I personally would focus on one or two issues you are having with them, any more than that and it might come across as a personal attack.\n\nHere's how I might phrase it;\n\n\"Hey,\n\nI'm sorry to say but I'm going to be withdrawing from our RP. I'm sure you've noticing my declining activity which, I'm sorry to say, is due to waning interest. I want to make it clear that there's no hard feelings from me and I felt that you have earned the right to be told the truth rather than me just ghosting you. \n\nFor me, I personally felt that a lot of the effort I put in, for instance the opening post of our RP, wasn't reciprocated by you. And that we might make plans on what world be what only for you to go your own way with it, which didn't feel awesome for me. I hope you understand that I only say this because you absolutely have the capacity to be a better writer and that maybe I'm not not the partner that can help bring out the best in you.\n\nWishing you all the very best\"\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",
