If your styles don't mix &amp; the replies feel forced or without any passion, then why bother keeping up with the RP? \n\nI think both of you reacted a little off. You being passive aggressive, him accusing you of something which isn't true. Shit happens, don't beat yourself up over this. For the next time don't try to make an RP work if you're not really feeling it though. That will save you &amp; your partner time &amp; frustration.",

I get the feeling that he's also just confusing you with someone else which happens sometimes.  Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time thinking about this.  I doubt he's thinking about it at all.

            "body": "I think one problem is that your answer to him wanting to end the roleplay is one of the most unwanted things people can do. It's not a huge mistake, but definitely something that always irks me a little. If people are nice enough not to ghost, and tell you why they want to end the roleplay without being rude in any way, please don't take it personally. I hate the feeling of telling someone in a rather nice way 'Hey, we don't work out, sorry', and suddenly they are like 'Well, (something I did in the roleplay) is super bad anyway,I'm glad it's over to be honest.' Yes, this is a little exaggerated but you get my point. I will just assume that the exclamation point problem is something that he did or that he asked you to do.\n\n Especially if my partner has never mentioned this problem before, it feels petty, as if they're trying to get back at me. If people do that, this behavior often prompts their partner to get defensive and retaliate. Which is what your partner did when he accused you of ghosting.\n\nHe probably just met a person before with whom he encountered similiar problems/who had a similiar writing style and preferences and who ghosted him, and now believes that you might have been that person. Honestly, I wouldn't read much more into this. It's over now, and approaching him again will probably not lead to anything.",
