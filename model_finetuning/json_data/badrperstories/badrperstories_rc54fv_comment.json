            "body": "It's probably not you.\nI've run into two types of RPers when it comes to plots.\n\nThe first is the player who has a character that is present in the scene. However, the character doesn't add anything past a reactionary post. The player doesn't add anything to the environment, setting, or drive conflict in any direction. It's almost like you're writing a story with a bystander who makes comments or idle actions.\n\nThe second is someone who is willing to write with you. They provide the same type of content that they are given on their turn, be it reactions, setting, or actions that drive conflict forward.\n\nUnfortunately, the first type is alot more common. Almost so common that it can feel painfully frustrating. It essentially feels like having a conversation or argument in hyperspace. I would suggest to keep looking and possibly clarify in RP ads 'must also be willing to add to/work on a plotline.'",

            "body": "Oh OP, I could write an entire tedious book about this sort of thing.  \nEven when partners otherwise totally line up, it\u2019s still common  \nthat some people will always just follow someone else\u2019s lead on the plotting. Whether  \nthat\u2019s for lack of confidence, awareness, just laziness, or some combination  \nthereof. (Disclaimer: there are also people that simply prefer to play in  \nsomeone else\u2019s world, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m referring to here.)   \nI\u2019ve lost count of the number of times where, upon receiving  \na response to an ad, I\u2019ve probed about things as simple as some basic character  \nideas and been met with \u201cidk, my main could be a healer or something\u201d after I\u2019ve  \ngiven them multiple plot ideas, some very involved and others minimal (I know  \nsome people like more, some like less) and samples and\u2026 everything! But they  \ngive nothing back.   \nCome to the party with something! ***Bring your own beer damn it!***  \nI think the most disappointing is when you have this intense excitement to build something, so you put forward ideas to expand on, plots to formulate, characters to construct, but are met with a response that could be summarised as \u201csure, in the future\u201d. You know this future won\u2019t happen because, for whatever reason, they\u2019re not jiving with the whole scheme like they might have hoped and haven\u2019t concluded that yet. If this is happening in the opening messages, I\u2019d say the rp is nearly always not going to work out. If someone can\u2019t find any enthusiasm or even strands of interest when the idea is at its most fresh, that\u2019s a real no-hoper of a situation. Or maybe I\u2019m a pessimist, who knows.  \nIn general, I\u2019ve found I can\u2019t rp with anyone where plotting/musing is seen as necessary evil between posts. Sharing ideas is almost the bloody best thing to me. It\u2019s soooo exciting when you\u2019re in a red-hot brainstorming sessions and converge on new ideas together and get that \u201cAHA!\u201d feeling. Equally, it\u2019s fantastic when you get a partner that really knows how to shunt things along with you by making NPCs without needing to be prodded, or in general that doesn\u2019t treat the construction scenes as a chore.  \nAll of this is to say I fully relate with your feeling, OP. I\u2019ve had rps where I\u2019ve continued to shoulder the majority of the inventive side, and the experience never gets better. You can\u2019t make someone enjoy that process or at least, not that particular rp. When you then write with someone that loves it, it feels effortless and exciting rather than this burdensome feeling that you\u2019ll be left making all the decisions. I don't like it also because it can start to feel *domineering* rather than cooperative, but the lack of feedback makes even that ambiguous!",

Reason being that the question itself is too vague haha.\n\nThere\u2019s is, however, an easy fix for that: change up the way you ask for ideas. Offer scenarios instead to gauge your how your partner\u2019s character would react:\n\nIf A comes from &lt;this background&gt; and does &lt;this action&gt; when meeting B, how would B feel about it?\n\nIf A doesn\u2019t go along with &lt;this scenario&gt;, what would B do?\n\nThen you choose the path that would be most fun to write.",

It often helps to give people something to draw off of, to start developing that confidence and to begin to trust that they have creative agency to bring forward even the ideas that may seem crazy. I always make sure to set expectations that no ideas are bad and even begin with a few prompts to get things moving\u2026\n\nI start with the basics. I ask what time periods are most interesting and caveat that nothing is hard and fast or set in stone. We will work through some ideas together and workshop them. Again, leading with questions phrased very much as you presented. Offer a few different options for plot direction and potential arcs for characters. \n\nThe answers I\u2019ve received are either super silo\u2019d where they can only imagine the dynamics of their own characters and aren\u2019t making an effort to envision how the two may come together or they say something to the tune of, \u201cI\u2019m not sure is there something you\u2019d prefer?\u201d Or people just don\u2019t answer and then repeat what they\u2019ve said prior with no real adaptation to what I\u2019ve said.\n\nIn any case, I do think this is helpful.
