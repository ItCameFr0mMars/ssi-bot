            "body": "Really, all you can do is ask. Or see if he's interested in starting up a new storyline, if the other one doesn't quite have the \"oomph\" anymore. Sometimes it's just tough for folks to get their creativity churning -- I know that's true for me, and where I was at the start of the pandemic (raring to go, picking up storylines left and right) is a huge difference from where I am now (creativity down to a trickle rather than a flood). So it's possible that his lack of interest isn't personal to you, just him, or maybe the \"muse\" for that particular storyline dried up.\n\nIn the meantime, you can always look for additional partners, in case the one with him doesn't pan out. But if you're still chatting OOC, that's a good sign, so I'd just ask him if he's interested, or if there's some other storyline he might like to try. My partner and I started speculating about an \"alternate universe\" version of our characters, maybe to take on if we ever wrap up the current storyline, and it's been super fun to just brainstorm and toss ideas around about plunking iterations of our medievalesque characters into a modern-day setting with supernatural critters!\n\nAt any rate, good luck!",

They might not end up going for it, but it would be very strange for them to react *badly*.  \n\nIn the end, you simply have to ask him, so it's then just about how you word it.\n\nSay that you'd really like to continue the rp if possible, but be sure to emphasise that there's no pressure for him to continue if he doesn't want to (for any reason).

It's going to become a pattern.  The best thing you can do is stop thinking of him as an rp partner and start thinking of him as a chat partner/online friend (depending how close you are).\n\nFrom there your choices are to accept that he may or may not occasionally post a reply or to just end the rp.  It's not going back to how it was when you started.  That's over.  You're going to need to find another roleplay partner if you want steady replies and interest.
