I don't really see how roleplaying is all that different from writing, it just so happens that you're writing interactively with a partner (or several). For that matter, it's not all that different from playing video games/MMORPGS, and plenty of folks do that. So I wouldn't worry. \n\nIf it helps, I'm in my 40s, am married, have a good job in the social work field, and yet I continue to write out fantasy worlds with partners around the world. It's a fun, creative hobby that hones your writing skills, allows you to put yourself in other people's shoes and gain more perspective, and one where you can make friends/engage socially, so no reason to feel sheepish about it.\n\nJust, y'know, try not to let it get in the way of work, and you'll be fine!",

I've been through college and four jobs since I started roleplaying and not a single classmate, professor, boss, or co-worker has known about it because I didn't talk about it. It's literally never come up. There's no way for them to know unless, maybe, you had your RP stuff plainly linked to social media with your real name attached, and you've already said you don't.\n\nBut also? It's not going to ruin your chance of getting a job. There's nothing wrong with roleplaying. At the end of the day it's a writing hobby, and a collaborative one at that, which requires unique skills on its own and is in no way a negative thing. There's nothing to worry about.",
