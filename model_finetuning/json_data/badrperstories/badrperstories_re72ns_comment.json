I expressed that I was finding it was a bit challenging to wedge in a character without more detail, but that maybe I could play some sort of enemy for this vampire family. I mentioned again that I tailor my characters to suit, but perhaps I could play some sort of cursed werewolf/shapeshifter type as a foil for these vampires.\n\nMy uneducated assumption is that the person had a combination of poor communication and poor reading comprehension that makes them prone to misunderstandings. Maybe they didn't actually wanna play the entire vampire family and so your reply came off as an insult / provocation.",

So many of these are just looking for an audience rather than a participant in the creative process, and are ridiculously invested in a whole meshwork of hidden specifics with no wiggle room. \n\nI'd bunch this sort of rper in with those that go fishing for *extremely* specific roles from their partners, and don't you dare negotiate on the details or imply you can't read their mind! \n\nCuriously, I still had a similar situation to yours where *I* created a character which my partner somehow claimed as *hers* and then chastised me for powerplaying and describing the \"wrong\" traits for them! I had to re-read her comment several times to make sure I wasn't having a moment. That rp ended a post later.\n\nIt kind of makes me wonder if we ran into the same person.",

But in this case, I felt like I was doing most of the communicating, like I'm trying to play a game where I have to guess what card they're holding but they're not giving me any clues.\n\nHonestly, if it weren't for this danged Gothic itch I want to scratch, I'd have given up earlier, so maybe I should take it as a blessing that they blocked me.

I had to remove him because I couldn't send him a message there. So he was the one who blocked me. He was weird though. He couldn't do things like seperate himself from the RP and had a problem with me when I said we had to. It was like he wanted to date me and I didn't even know him.
