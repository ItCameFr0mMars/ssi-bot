            "body": "I totally agree, and that\u2019s exactly what I tried to do. But there was an intricacy, and that was in the inherent unpredictability of the roleplay.\n\nBasically, my character was based on a character in a show my partner had never watched, and that character also had a few of my flourishes as well. I showed him all the necessary clips of my character from the show and described to him in detail all the intricacies with my character. \n\nHowever, here\u2019s the intricacy \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how \u201cexactly\u201d the plot would change when my partner would make a new post (and he wouldn\u2019t know for me either). So, essentially, there was no way I could give some bright line rules about how my character would react in X, Y, or Z situation, because we wouldn\u2019t know where each of us would be taking the story.\n\nSo maybe the solution would be to have an outline of where each of our posts would go. But then isn\u2019t that an issue in itself? One of the big reasons people get into roleplaying in the first place is because of the unpredictability of it. The story is alive because each partner doesn\u2019t know what the other will write.\n\nIf they did, then I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be a roleplay \u2014 it\u2019d be a coauthored fanfiction. Which isn\u2019t bad at all, but I feel like it would defeat the entire purpose of roleplaying in the first place. And so without that predictability of where a storyline will go, I could only explain what my character would do in the abstract.\n\nI guess in the end, maybe that volatility mixed with an attempt at being literate, from both of us, was what killed the roleplay. Because we were essentially giving each other a bunch equations for our characters but we\u2019re getting mad when we weren\u2019t arriving at the same answers.",

And 100% get where they\u2019re coming from. \n\nIt\u2019s just that, to me, the entire premise of a roleplay is that complete lack of predictability. What roleplays can do that fanfiction never can is give you that sense of being in a world you can\u2019t fully control. Because if it\u2019s a fanfiction (or original story of course), you completely control where the story is going. A roleplay should be the complete opposite of that.\n\nBut if a roleplay is completely unpredictable, you can\u2019t get into those hypotheticals, because they\u2019d essentially act as spoilers and make things feel predetermined.\n\nSo really maybe it\u2019s more about optimal length. If you go past 3/4 paragraphs, it does seem inevitable that you get into these sorts of issues. 3/4 paragraphs may be the optimal size to be able to show one\u2019s writing flair in a roleplay without having to invade into another character\u2019s territory.",

I'm a bit anal about it, so I'd write little connecting references (\"didn't notice\", \"forgot to mention\", and the like) in my next scenes if my partner writes something out of place. It's not the best for readability but as long as you both understand what's going on, I think it's fine. It's going to require heavy editing if it's to be shown to others, but that's generally the case for any writer's draft.",

I understand what they're doing with the story so much better because they've told me. It's really produced some magical discussions that I love as much as the rp. I've gotten to hear their inspiration for their characters and world building. It helps that they make very purposeful choices for their characters. They have a really great range of personalities and motivations for each one, and I can always see how each of their choices connects to build a whole person. If they don't like a choice or it doesn't fit they're perfectly comfortable just speaking up and helping you understand why it doesn't fit.\n\nThat being said, I still try to have some flexibility with my characters. Right now I'm playing one of the main antagonists, he was going to be a small character. But a few people had ideas for his backstory and behavior that I never could have thought of on my own. I liked them more then anything I came up with and now I have a character that I absolutely adore.

            "body": "&gt;And even if you have similar views about your characters, there will always be differences in your perspectives, and that\u2019s going to cause the end for your roleplay eventually.\n\nI know what you're feeling, but it is possible to avoid this problem. I have been writing with my current main writing partner for 5 years or so now and we address the whole 'I gotta control your character sometimes' in a few ways: \n\n-We mostly write at the same time together and just ask ooc 'hey do you mind if I have your character do x?'  \n\n-We have a strong sense of most of the characters that the other person writes and can predict with a high degree of accuracy what the character will do.  \n\n-Corollary to the last point though, *if* either of us ever gets it wrong we just tell the other person and they edit their post after we figure out what the character *would* have done, with no ego or hurt feelings getting in the way.  \n\n-Sometimes we do **shorter posts.** I think this is one that some 'literate' roleplayers can be afraid to embrace. I'm a para roleplayer, but not every post can be a good chunky length without ending up with really fragmented action and strange conversation that is actually 5 conversations at once that branched from the original conversation. People don't usually talk like that.    \n\nSometimes when you are determined to match a length you actually neuter the impact of important moments in said scene. I'm big on trying to notice 'moments' in a reply that the other person will want to reply to, and not giving too many of those in one reply. Let stuff breathe and have its time to impact and shift the flow of the action, you know?  \n\nMy main point in mentioning shorter posts though, is to become more comfortable cutting off your reply when you hit a spot where you'd be controlling the other person's character. Finish your reply *there*, then message them ooc and talk about the scene and what you thought might happen, and ask if they could give you a quick reply of *them* writing what their character does. For a lot of moments when a character gets godmodded (assuming it isn't a common thing like assuming your character will follow theirs as they walk down a path together) that godmodded action is actually something the other player would *want* to write their character doing or reacting to.  \n\nBasically, my advice would be to abandon this mentality:\n\n&gt;unless you want to write five paragraphs describing the weather or something in an action-packed scene.\n\nBasically, who says you need to? The para police? Talk to your partner about how a post here or there might be shorter for pacing reasons on *both* your ends, and skip the part where you stuff unrelated fluff into a scene *just* so that you hit 5 paragraphs or more per reply. It's fine to aim for a certain length that you prefer, but in my opinion at least, roleplay shines with a bit of flexibility and while remembering that brevity is the soul of wit (I say in this overly verbose post, ha).  \n\nI think a lot of people miss the forest for the trees when it comes to roleplay. They become too focused on hitting some 'label' of lit or semi-lit or adv lit and they miss the fact that the focus should be on writing an engaging roleplay, you know?\n\n----\n\nAll of that being said, you're also totally right that roleplay hits different from a story written and edited down by a competent writer. Hell, even a pair of writers, but with the goal of writing one story and not the ping pong match that roleplay just inherently is. I sometimes come across fanfic that I can tell *immediately* is someone's roleplay that they pasted into one doc and posted up as a fanfic. Usually they are unreadable and I end up disappointed if the premise was a fun one.  \n\n*But*, roleplay doesn't need to be that, you know? It has its own strengths. You can make your own stories with someone just as enthusiastic as you are about them, in real time. Roleplay feels very alive to me in a way that I love. To me, the goal of roleplay isn't to have the perfect story, not really. Of course I want a story I love, but roleplay is far more about the journey itself.",
