Only for three whole months to pass, I get enough and just drop a message in their DMs that I'm leaving as it's clear they aren't actually interested.\n\nA year later, guess whose back? Same story only this time the rp just got to a singular ten posts before they started ignoring me again. Again I was quiet for three months before finally having enough, I left the server and sent him a DM stating 'I've had enough with this, I'm starting to feel like somebody you're coming to when all of your other partners are busy. Well no more, I'm done with this shit. Please don't readd me for a third time, we're through.'\n\nHe's lucky I was patient that long, I only was patient for three months as we used to be friends.

            "body": "I've had two memorable experiences like this.\n\nFirst one was one of my first RP partners ever. We'd been roleplaying for ~6 months when they started vanishing. First just a couple days, then weeks, then months at a time. There was never any communication, no heads up that they'd be gone, and no apologies when they returned. Would just talk about how much fun they were having on some other RP account. They always dropped what we'd previously been writing, started new things only to vanish again a few days later, and no matter how long they were gone they always expected me to be there waiting for them. After about a year of this, they finally just... never logged in again.\n\nSecond one. Fandom RP. We only wrote a little bit here and there and chatted a few times ooc. Very casual. They stopped logging in after a month or so. A year later, they came back. I was excited to see them again, and we continued right where we left off. Still very casual. They disappeared again for yet another year. When they came back the second time, they said they were back for good... and were suddenly behaving as if we were extremely close friends. Telling me I was the only RP partner they needed, what a great friend I was, how I wrote this canon character better than everyone else. Messaged me to chat ooc daily, for hours and sometimes late into the night. Drew me pictures. Offered to send me money when I was struggling financially. I thought it was strange, but this was during the height of quarantine in 2020 and I was lonely, so unfortunately I got attached.\n\nNot even three months later they abruptly decided they weren't going to RP anymore, deleted their RP account, and stopped messaging me on Discord. I haven't heard from them since and it honestly messed me up for a little bit.",

And they are still responsive if I talk about ocs.\n\nHonestly it makes me feel like I'm the weird one because I've never known anyone else who can keep interest in an RP for as long as I can.

No matter how good a writer they are, the only way this will end for those of us who are more dedicated is with heartache. The earlier you cut it off, the easier to handle the heartache will be.",

I feel you on that so much. I've always had my suspicion that I must have a codependent personality. Thanks, I'll start lurking that sub. \n\nAnd I mean, this guy literally lovebombed me. For the entire 2 months prior to his disappearance, he was telling me \"love you\" (platonically) all the time, calling me by pet names, always offering a listening ear, etc. I put my share of effort into our interactions myself, without acting clingy.\n\nHow could he just ghost after all of *that*? At some point it's clear that I value our friendship over the roleplay. After 1 week of silence, I send the obligatory are-you-okay message, and now it's been another 2 weeks of him constantly online but ignoring me. I want to be petty and leave the Discord server/remove him as a friend before he can even come back, but that makes me feel like I'm just being dramatic...\n\nI appreciate your advice!",

            "body": "I\u2019ve had a partner like this before! We used to talk everyday and do rapid fire on discord, for like three months. Things got busy which I understood but they were still talking to me ooc so I put up with it. A month of just daily messages ooc I wanted to get back to writing, because to be honest the plot and characters meant a lot to me but they kept shooting me down and in the end I found myself growing a little resentful and wanting to introduce a bit of distance. \n\nThey ended up coming back awhile after to suggest a new plot. It worked for awhile then they disappeared again. This repeated for a second time and it felt like it wasn\u2019t worth it anymore because they wanted to do new fandoms they were interested in which I only vaguely knew of and had no other interest of writing. \n\nI let them string me along because of our history, and because I considered us friends but I think in the end I never got over my feelings of resentment (when I expressed that I was a little disappointed she had constantly turned me down, she berated me for not being more understanding) and a rp relationship could never work. Not to mention how I didn\u2019t want to get invested only to be constantly dropped. To anyone who is in the same situation, try to put yourself first! There are plenty of other role players out there",
