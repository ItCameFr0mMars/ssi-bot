Of course you can talk things through OOC or share your opinion on certain posts or decisions that were made, but to shit talk your characters &amp; complaining about it nonstop for a year is too much in my opinion.\n\nTo me it seems like you both have different opinions on what a ''good'' RP is. You want the hard decisions, you want flaws, you want uncomfortable situations, you want realism to a certain degree &amp; think logically. Ray on the other hand seems to want a more vanilla RP, in which her character must be priority in your ship. She can't handle consequenses at all, nor can she let go.\n\nTo me personally this sounds exhausting to put up with. RP is a hobby, you do it for fun. &amp; you can only have true fun if you &amp; your partner are on the same page &amp; have the same expectations for the RP.",

I expected other characters to dislike them, for them to face consequences, etc. But I ran into a few RPers who would not stop going on about how much their characters hated mine, how awful they are, and in some cases even how much they themselves hated the character. The character was supposed to have a redemption arc but no matter what they did, it wouldn't count. Permanently marked an evil person who could never change. They basically treated them as a punching bag ic and ooc, and on top of it all never allowed criticism about their own characters. They always had to be in the right.\n\nI cut ties with those people, because the constant negativity wasn't fun and it felt bad. It's absolutely not normal and I can't imagine putting up with it for an entire year. I know you don't want to part ways, but if you've talked to your partner about this and they won't stop doing it, and it bothers you (which you have every right to be bothered), I'd personally suggest finding a different partner that respects you and your characters more.",

That page is known as the DEAR MAN.  \n\n\n* **DESCRIBE** the situation\u2014'Roleplay and writing are about conflict and resolution, it is true. However, there is a finite period of time for callbacks and recrimination. I would be a lot more comfortable if past transgressions were not being brought up in perpetuity.\n* **EXPRESS** how the constant browbeating makes you feal. 'I feel apprehensive when I want to introduce a conflict of some sort into play. I worry that it's going to keep being brought up and used as a reason to belittle me, my character(s) or both.' 'I statements' are important here. Make sure you don't project stuff onto them.\n* **ASSERT** what your needs are. 'I need to feel like any major conflict or pivot in the story can take place without a period of adversity that extends beyond the needs of the story. I also don't want 'splashover' from IC to OOC.'\n* **REINFORCE/REWARD** the other person if they respond to you. 'Thank you so much for hearing me out. I love playing with you and I think this will help!  \n\n* **MINDFUL** Don't get sidetracked. If the person tries to steer the discussion in some other direction, redirect them in a kind way. 'We can talk about that, but I do want to get this current thing handled first.' \n* **APPEAR CONFIDENT** Come straight out with what you need. Don't waffle around about it, be direct and to the point.\n* **NEGOTIATE** Be ready to take new information on board if your partner offers it. If they give you an honest reason they want you to soften a boundary, be willing to do some negotiation.\n\n  \nI have found this to help all manner of  conflicts come to a resolution. Effective communication is the name of the game here. Framing it even just by using this and writing down what you want to say may help you get this where you want it to be. It sounds like you want to keep writing with this person. Hopefully some part of this helps that to happen.",

If you have one (1) negative interaction with another oc, that oc would just refuse to speak to u again.

Started up some connections with my character and I said cool sure.\n\nSo my character gif a very bad spot in their life. And so, made some bad decisions and lost her characters as friends ( one wasn\u2019t even actually bad in fact it was pretty morally correct but I won\u2019t get into it as that\u2019s not the point ) \n\nFor MONTHS all I got was sly comments from her about my character. Her not talking to me, avoiding me, being bitchy. And only coming online to trash my character. And when no one would agree with her assessment? Back offline she went. Until recently she decided that she wanted to make amends and just have them be mutuals but I just imagine it\u2019s gonna be her trying to get my character to metaphorical kiss ass and I\u2019m not down for it. \n\nIn any case people like that. That can\u2019t stand to see their OC be in the wrong tend to do a LOT of self inserting and character/rp blending. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to do their character dealing with consequences because by calling their oc a flawed person you are calling them flawed. As their is no separation for them. And they can\u2019t take criticism. \n\nIt seems like Ray like the attention of being a victim to her circumstances. And therefore, always needs someone else to be in the wrong because if she\u2019s in the wrong then she can\u2019t play the poor victim that gets to gaslight you into giving her endless attention because \u2018 you hurt such and such you owe it to them to be glued to their ass. \u2018 \n\nI would consider maybe just keeping her ad a friend and no longer rping with her or at the very leave give it a break.",

            "body": "Paired with your reply to the other comment, I think I get where you're coming from, and I don't really have a clear answer honestly. \n\nWe don't really set up plots too much in advance unless they're major, so many of the conflicts tend to arise 'organically.' After 2 years, we have about 30 characters, 5 of which are 'main' plot movers. Even then our minor characters are pretty fleshed out, so the entire cast tends to set up a fictional social dynamic even without our input - moving one character shifts all of the others, so it's near-impossible not to have some type of consequence on either side, good *or* bad. \n\nI haven't noticed a pattern of my partner steering the plot in ways that are detrimental to my OCs  - if anything, she ends up steering her own characters to difficult situations, which she then backs out of. \n\nAfter noticing her aversion to making such choices, I brought it up with her and we revisited what type of RP she might want (about 6 months ago I would say!), and she insisted she was fine with what we'd had. I did stop suggesting plots that would put her OCs in a tough spot, and to some extent mine if I could avoid it, so everything else is sort of that 'social net' reacting to situations our characters find themselves in which muddies the clarity of who's doing what a little bit.",
