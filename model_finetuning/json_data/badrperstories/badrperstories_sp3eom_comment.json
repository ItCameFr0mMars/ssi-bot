            "body": "Not every part of a roleplay post is something you're able to respond to. Some people like to include their characters' inner thoughts, flashbacks, descriptions of surroundings, and other things you might not be able to react to IC. Hopefully these writers are also putting something in their posts you *can* respond to.\n\nI think the most important thing, first of all, is: do you *enjoy* this style of roleplay? Do you *want* to type and read long replies? Generally speaking, post length compatibility is pretty important. Longform RP feels like a slog for shortform RPers, and shortform posts feel disappointing to someone who just typed a novella and received a few sentences in return. Neither way is wrong and neither is better. The point is: **you need to have some kind of accord or no one's going to have a good time.** (Obligatory, not every post has to match the one before it. This is an \"on average\" deal.)\n\nIf you don't know what's going on in an RP and there's far too much history for you to actually read through it, you'll need to ask someone for the Cliffnotes: \"Hey, can I get a quick summary of what's going on?\"\n\nIf you're joining a specific scene, you're going to want to need to read through it, first. This is where the whole, \"do you actually want to read these posts?\" question comes in.\n\nI'm not clear on whether you're looking for advice about writing longer posts, but I'm gonna go ahead and touch on that, too:\n\nIf you've run out of things to say, it's time to end the post. I can't speak for how these other RPers are structuring their posts, but throwing a bunch of filler in just to make longer paragraphs is a bad practice and wastes everyone's time.\n\nThat said, it never hurts to be descriptive. If they describe the surroundings for you, have your character interact with them. Have them see, hear, smell, touch the items around them. Let it feel like there's a background and everyone's not standing in a white vacuum.\n\nYou can describe how your character feels about the other characters' body language and facial expressions. They can remember details from their past and contemplate things and while they interact they'll have body language of their own you can describe. Basically, anything that might help the other people you're writing with envision what's going on and make it more immersive for them is great to include. Anything that's added just to make a longer post is not needed. And, of course, you want to make sure you give them things they can respond to in your posts!",

            "body": "Long reply warning.\n\nFirst of all, don't worry about the downvotes - there's a lot of people on here that get trigger happy if anyone dare expresses that their precious label is not the be-all-end-all of \\*glorious\\* roleplaying. \n\nYou aren't being impolite, and your questions are very common ones in all roleplay circles. \n\nNow, as for length, \"too long\" is a relative thing, but my first question is: how much are they giving you to respond to? It's possible to write any number of words and \"say\" nothing at all, or even too much. In particular, everyone struggles to write with roleplayers that give you *nothing* to work with, so don't automatically feel bad if you encounter a \"literate\" roleplayer that seems suprisingly light on substance, however nice their posts may otherwise be.\n\n* If you feel you have a good amount or \"quite a lot\" to respond to in each post, it pays to be methodical when you write your own reply. When I've got bigguns with a lot going on, I like to highlight dialogue and actions my character(s) could plausibly to respond to. I then write up my post in another window/screen in parallel. This helps me keep the timeline straight and really get to grips with what needs doing. Of course, it takes work to make sure you don't end up with a robotic sequence of events - not every action needs a response, and in turn you have to be willing to give back usually about an equal amount to progress the scene. \n   * Knowing what to cut and what to include is just part of getting better at roleplay imo; sometimes you absolutely should just \"ignore\" parts in your response.\n* If you feel the posts are long but fairly low on actionable content, firstly, I'd suggest \\*not\\* fluffing up your posts to match their length. This will be an exhausting process unless you specifically *want* to go on an introspection/description heavy angle, but more often than not, it just feels insubstantial.  Instead, just write as much as you need to respond and progress the scene. \n* If you feel the posts have either very little to respond to in each post (they're making you drag a story forward) OR they're cramming in shitloads with every post and the timeline is \\*zipping\\* by without giving your character(s) a chance to respond, you *must* talk to them OOC about it. In general, I'm not a fan of fixing OOC problems IC. If the group roleplayers are really vibing with how things are going (definitely not a given) then you may just need to accept the rp won't be satisfying for you.\n\nNow coming onto the problem of \"what is going on\" background, lore, and the like.\n\nI don't know what medium you're using but *always* check for background and lore guides/channels/etc. before asking key roleplayers questions. Most often you don't need to go through any info with a fine-toothed comb, just be aware of the main ideas going on and very importantly, *how they relate to your character* anddd the *type of scenes you want to write in*. There's nothing wrong with being a more casual roleplayer, but if you go into a circle that's maybe a bit less casual and wants more effort from you, it's important to show willing and read this stuff - it shouldn't be a chore, it should be interesting!\n\nOnce you have that in your mind, *then* ask people more about it.\n\nNow if the issue is you're taking part in threads that are verrrry old/long, obviously you can just look up the history if possible before you join in, but if it's too much to read in a reasonable amount of time, just check your assumptions with the current roleplayers before you start in the scene.\n\n\"*Hey so I was thinking of entering X scene with my character Y doing Z and \\[expand on some ideas you have\\], would this fit in with what is going on? Is there anything particular I really need to know besides?\"*\n\nAll of this said: just as not all roleplayers are equal, not all groups are equal. Some have horrendous ways of recording info/lore, but most places really just want players that are willing to read, listen, and ask relevant questions. If you do all of that and it still isn't working, maybe it's better left alone.",
