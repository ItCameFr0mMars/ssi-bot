I didn't have to list off a bunch of weird kinks bc I wasn't looking for ERP. It just meant that I was fine with smut or death or whatever. \n\nBut, I cut this out eventually bc me saying I didn't have many limits to speak on led to people thinking I was in for ERP. And then I especially don't say I'm limitless on reddit, because reddit is a different beast whenever it comes to these things than the other site I roleplay.",
