Alternately, people can lack self awareness and be terrible partners while thinking it's going great\n\nBottom line - maybe you did something wrong, maybe you didn't. Doesn't really matter. It is what it is, and it's best to just move on from it (I know, I know, easier said than done)",

            "body": "Hi there, just wanted to say I definitely sympathise. Like you, I've always felt blocking is a pretty \"extreme\" signal. I almost never have needed to block people, save for those trying to try to show me stuff I don't want to see, or act blatantly nutty; certainly not over something like \"hmm guess I'm not interested in this rp\".\n\nHowever, if you browse around on here, you'll find many other roleplayers don't see blocking *at all* like this, so be aware that this probably has very little to do with you as a person. Some use blocking as a way to filter out people for future searches and do it in a very routine fashion, though I'd still say it's rude to block without some prior message along the lines of \"thanks but no thanks\". I guess the one good here is that they didn't choose to delete the server as a whole, giving you the opportunity to salvage your pins/writing (imo, server deleting is unequivocally shitty, yet some do it routinely).\n\nAs /u/lipkro has said, it may or may not even relate to anything you said/did, so be careful not to internalise this. All sorts of things can turn someone off to a roleplay, and indeed, maybe life did just overwhelm them. Abrupt blocking is basically a way to end things without having any type of confrontation - in that sense, it's definitely a \"them\" thing.",

            "body": "Do you know if she blocked you specifically and stuck around communicating/RPing with others, or has she left the platform period?\n\nBecause if it's the latter, I can share some stories. It has happened to both me and friends of mine - someone just up and leaves without warning, deletes everything and outright vanishes.\n\nBut I've had (and been told) cases where someone does that... and then, some point later - a few months, a full year or longer - they come back. In some cases they reached out to me again, in the cases of friends they were rediscovered, but either way, *some* answers were given. The exact reasons vary but I've noticed some common trends:\n\nToo much of RL happening. Sometimes it's not just stress of school or work, but a pivotal moment in someone's life - heartbreak, tragedy in the family, or having a sudden epiphany. In one case, it was realizing that they're no longer RPing just for fun, but as an *escape mechanism*, escaping reality so that they don't have to deal with their problems and instead daydream about some happy story featuring X or Y by RPing it out, thus causing their problems to deepen. In another - that they're addicted to RP and prioritize it over everything else, so they need to stop it ASAP by quitting it cold turkey - by burning down all bridges, thus hoping they'll make it as hard as possible to come back later.\n\nOne case really stands out to me, though, because the RPer who did it otherwise struck me as an incredibly kind and compassionate person - both through her interests and how she portrayed her character. When she ended up deleting everything, my guess was that she did so out of *fear* \\- that if she announced her plans to leave, someone might persuade her to stay.\n\nIf it's the former (she blocked you, but is still around), then the *worst* thing you can do is to think, \"What did I do wrong?\" Don't self-reflect on it and don't dwell on it too much. Even if you 'identified' a reason of what you did wrong and decided to 'adjust' it, then you run the risk of having someone *else* take issue with said adjustments. Even if you did something wrong (which is something I seriously doubt), it's down to the person who took offense to *tell* you about it.",
