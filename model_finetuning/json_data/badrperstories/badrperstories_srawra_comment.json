The second time he ghosted around Nov and just started DMing me again today.\n\nLooking at his profile I can see he's responding to some of his RolePlays but instead of DMing me and his other partners that had longer form Rps he just posted on his profile that he was taking a spontaneous hiatus (for some RolePlays only) and no one saw it. (Literally, one of his partners was on there asking wtf) . I don't mind hiatus but you could've sent me a DM even if it was copy/pasted.",
