You can suggest putting things officially on hiatus if she needs time to handle things offline. \n\nIf she's dealing with being suddenly busy offline, she may feel guilty about the lack of communication online and that's in turn preventing her from reaching out to you. That's happened to me, tbh. It's a bad cycle, tough to break.\n\nWorst case scenario, she's emotionally detached from the RP and losing interest fast but without her saying that, it's probably not going to be salvaged. I hope it works out for you both, if give it one last shot at communicating your concerns, being gentle (not needy or pushy) and accepting where the cards fall. I have some RPs where we're chatty and others where there's zero OOC which sucks. But somehow it works anyway?",

I just wanted to check in and see if everything is alright?\" It's possible she's dealing with something outside the Internet that's affecting her mood and writing ability.\n\nIf she tells you everything's alright with her, you can move on to bringing up the RP side of things: \"I just notice you don't seem as enthusiastic about the RP, and lately we're not in accord about the plot. For example, I didn't know my character was expected to (her plan) until after the fact. Is everything okay with our RP on your end?\"\n\nNone of this is asking her to simply RP more often and more quickly. Instead, it addresses possible causes so you can determine whether it can be worked on and whether there's anything you can do to help. It's possible the answer will be \"I have writer's block\" or something similar, in which case the only thing to do is wait it out or reassess if the RP partnership still works for you. If it doesn't, you shouldn't feel badly. As long as you treat the situation with kindness and compassion, you're not doing anything wrong.",
