            "body": "1. I have, absolutely, sent messages just like that to partners. Heck, I got one yesterday from someone asking me if she could send me some plot points because she didn\u2019t want to bother me since it\u2019s been a while since I posted. I said absolutely and we talked about the plot for awhile. I am a chatty person. I talk *a lot*. But I found I can tell pretty quickly what partners will be open to it and who won\u2019t; if they never start ad-how conversations with me, I tone it down as well.\n\n2. Depends on the partner. I have some that I talk about just about everything. Very open. And some that it\u2019s just the roleplay.\n\n3. I don\u2019t think you can. We all need to grow up a bit and be more honest.\n\n4. I generally just send a message if it\u2019s been a while. I try not to overthink this one. Usually include a \u201cdon\u2019t rush\u201d and phrase it like I\u2019m just making sure they have not forgotten.\n\n5. This depends on the partner. If they don\u2019t respond to something not important I just leave it. If it\u2019s plot related or you need an answer, I recommend gently prodding, it might have just been missed. Personally I\u2019m a super patient person so I usually don\u2019t poke for like a week or more, sometimes even a month, unless we have a rapport and they\u2019re usually much faster.",

            "body": "Re, How much OOC: \nAs much as necessary! Some people like it, some people don't. I love OOC but a personal boundary for me is rl photos, as I like the anonymity of rp and don't want to know who's behind the screen. Not that I don't care for them, it's just a placebo basically- since I get nervous talking to real people. If you find their OOC responses short or what ever, they probably just prefer not chatting much OOC and don't take it to heart. \n\nRe, Topics:\nMy go to is pets, I love sharing and receiving pet pics. Weather is also surprisingly interesting, especially if your partner lives far away. It's summer here but my rp partner sent pics and the snow is all the way up to his knee there! Share information about Y/c, photos or a song you've voice claimed and see if they have anything to send. A meme relevant to either the story or character is great too! I send alot of 'non cannon' roleplay shit, alot of meme-ish theoreticals. Though that really only works if you have two or more threads, otherwise ooc can be hard to differentiate.\n\n--------------------\nTypo gets Kai a bottle of beer but canot get it open, accidentally shatters the bottle in the process. \n\nAfter its cleaned up Typo gets Kai a new bottle and hands it over, Kai opens it easily and Typo is super confused/offended.\n\nIt was a screw cap.\n--------------------\n\nThis had absolutely nothing to do with the roleplay btw. You can become real friends with the people you write with but don't force it I suppose, if it happens- it happens.\n\nRe, Polite:\nWish I knew man, I just try and keep things honest. \n\nRe, Touching Base:\nA meme, gif or general 'hi, how are you?' is good.\n\nRe, Cooldown:\nI personally discuss this with my partners before starting, some people don't mind if you bump once a day while others prefer it every three days or once a week. I don't allow bumping personally IRP but I talk in ooc to my partners nearly every day, before starting we both agree to reply about every 12 hours (once a day) and we usually give a heads up if we are busy/unwell etc so there is no need to ask. That's up to personal taste. \n\nMost often though, I see about 3 days to a week.\n\nIf you've bumped the chat 3 times, I'd personally archive it and assume it's ghosted and/or wait for them to reach out.",

Just a quick question, but what exactly are ad-how conversations? I've tried looking up the terminology but I can't find what that means :(\n\n&gt;We all need to grow up a bit and be more honest.\n\nAh, true. I think this is definitely something I'll have to keep working on. It's always a little awkward when you're sort of feeling it but also not, but don't want to hurt the other person's feelings for fear that they are still into it :')\n\nAlso, thank you for the advice on poking in general, I really like how you view things and I think just leaving it and prodding every once in a long while is a good approach to things C:",

I have a partner that I\u2019ve been roleplaying with for 6 years, and we often talk about plots we have no intention of actually roleplaying. Like I\u2019ve *always* got a dozen ideas bouncing around in my head that I want to do but I obviously don\u2019t have time to roleplay them all. So I\u2019ll pitch the plot to her, she\u2019ll help me mould it, we\u2019ll do what I call \u201cmini role-playing\u201d which basically just means we do conversations as if we were the characters in the ooc without formally doing \u201cposts\u201d and then we\u2019ll drop it forever. We\u2019ve got 4 roleplays that we actually do proper, long, posts for, but every now and again we just hash out a new idea and half-roleplay it for a bit. Very informally.\n\n~~If this doesn\u2019t sound insane to you you should message me; I\u2019d love another partner to do this sort of thing with! This is a side point though lol~~\n\nBut yeah tbh I find plotting nearly as enjoyable as roleplaying with the right person.

            "body": "To answer the first thing you were curious about, spontaneous roleplays with little to no planning are the only ones that have ever worked out for me long-term.  The catch is you both have to be like 95% improvisational roleplayers for it to work and you have to have your boundaries firmly set beforehand.  If one of you isn't or the boundaries aren't there, it's going either to get boring or uncomfortable.  It also doesn't hurt if you've both got a lot of experience as GMs outside of 1x1 roleplaying.  No onto the other questions.\n\n1)  I think this is something that should be discussed before you ever start roleplaying with someone new.  Lay out clear expectations on each side.  If you love to chat about your rp, let your partner know.  If you love ooc chat about life, let them know.  The two of you should agree to something that works for you both.  There can be compromise, but be realistic about your needs.\n\n2)  I usually just talk about the roleplay with new partners.  Sometimes that leads into sharing bits about myself.  And sometimes that might lead to a friendship.  It's something that happens organically for me as I am only roleplaying for roleplay sake rather than as a social activity.  Again, that's something that you should talk about before you start writing with someone if you're looking to be friends outside of the writing.\n\n3) You can't and it sucks.  I always try to force myself to take people 100% at their word and reason that if they can't be direct, it's their own fault.  It's a very hard thing to do, but it helps me personally when I can at least admit it's probably my own anxiety messing with me.  It gets a little easier when you're older and have less patience for people.\n\n4) Just be honest.  \"Hello!  Just thought I'd say hi!  How are things?\" is nice and casual with no expectations attached.  I've had really good luck with it.\n\n5) I assume that if they answered one message but not the other, that they probably either missed the unread message or got distracted and forgot about it.  That's because I 100% do the same thing all the time.   I don't poke people at all, ever.  I figure if they forget about me for more than a week, they're not worth my time, but I keep the lines of communication open in case they reach out.\n\nHonestly, I think having upfront talks where you and your partners discuss ooc chat boundies and expectations together before doing anything else would go a long way in helping alleviate these issues.  Straight up ask your partners how much ooc they're comfortable with, how they'd like you to check up on them ooc, if they are ok with an occasional poke and how often, etc.",

            "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I would be careful that you don't send to many questions at once. If they haven't even replied to your first funny headcanon/possible plot element, it's best to wait until they do, because too much at once can be pressuring for some people. And try to include your partner's ideas, too. It should be (at least for me) like a back and forth. For example, if you send me a detailed idea for a new character arc or plot element, don't send me 3000 words at once which already include nearly everything interesting that could happen in that scenario before I even say 'Hey, yes, this sounds nice, we can definitely include this.' Keep it a bit more simple at first, or it might make it very hard for your partner to say 'No, I'm not really feeling this scenario.' because they might fear that this answer will disappoint you.\n2. This entirely depends on the person. Vague details about life are okay, but there are some limits (except if we've already written for a long time and are basically friends). Talking about your hobbies, favourite tv shows, your pets and so on is fine. Venting or dumping your rp frustrations is a dealbreaker for many people, especially in the beginning. It's okay to say 'Sorry, my day was a bit stressful' but 'Damn it, this lying cunt told me that they hate ghosting, and today they ghosted me. Don't you hate people like that, Nachtreiher?' is very uncomfortable for your partner. The same applies when it comes to asking about advice or going into detail when it comes to rather depressing parts of your life. Most people can't really handle that and don't know what to reply to something like that. \n3. I usually realize this when their words don't match their actions. For example if they say 'No, don't worry, I totally love your new character/your plot idea!' but then they claim that they have no idea how to include it in the roleplay and don't seem to interested in anything you propose, always avoiding the topic and so on. Or you realize that their answers are suddenly a lot shorter than usual, only 'Okay.' or 'I guess this will do.' instead of something more elaborate like 'Yes, this sounds nice, maybe he could be the brother of...'. But only when it comes to the topic that you think might be a problem for them.\n4. It's not a bad thing to care, but there are some general rules for me: write them once and then wait for their reply. The reason many people come across as pushy is because their partner is absent for a few days, and when they come back they have twenty messages like 'Hey, are you alright?'/'Are you even interested anymore?'/'I'm really worried.' Even though they have only been gone for three days and haven't even replied to the first one. If you sent something like 'Hey, I was just wondering if you're alright...', at least wait like a week until you send the next message. If they don't want to reply or can't reply, they won't reply even if you send more and more messages. If you ask them how their day was or say something like 'I hope you're fine.' and they reply with something like 'Hey, my day was a bit stressful, because it was my birthday and we had a lot of guests. Unfortunately, I felt quite sick after eating at a fast food restaurant. But overall, my day was great.' don't just answer with something like 'Okay cool, so about our roleplay...' Because they give you a lot to work with (congratulate them, ask if they feel better now, what presents they got), and you only seem interested in the roleplay. They might wonder 'Why did they even ask about it if they don't seem to care at all about what my answer was?' and it comes across as if you're just pushy but want to hide it behind that question to seem less pushy.\n5. Depends on the partner and their reply frequency. If they always reply immediately when it comes to headcanons and questions related to a certain character or plot element, but only reply sporadically when the question is about another character/plot element, I would take that as a lack of interest. Your reaction to this depends on whether it is important for you to include it or not. If you absolutely want to include it, and the roleplay wouldn't be what you're looking for without it, I would ask them whether they're really interested. If it's not that important, stop mentioning the topic and if they never talk about it again, you have your answer (they're not interested in doing it) and I would just drop the plot element. Another example is: you ask them something, they don't reply for a few days. You send another question about something else, this time they reply straight away. This doesn't necessarily mean that they lack interest, maybe they just forgot to answer the first question because they were busy when they read the message. I would just say something like 'Oh, and about (topic of the first question), would that also be alright with you?' If they avoid it and don't reply again, and always seem to ignore that one specific question, something is up.",

            "body": "1. Varies from person to person. At *minimum*, imho, is to communicate whenever you have questions or need clarification. Don\u2019t make assumptions, but get confirmation. Good roleplay *needs* good communication because it\u2019s teamwork; all involved should be on the same page and wavelength for things to run satisfactorily. Any other OOC chatter, you\u2019ll have to gauge this yourself. Test waters by asking about their day for example, and if they\u2019re willing to engage you with a story, you\u2019ll know that they are at least okay with the occasional chatter.\n\n2. Again, depends. After the initial plot-discussion phase, I\u2019ll make small comments about random things. Something in the recent news, maybe, or perhaps a funny thing that happened last week at work. How willing they are to engage with my little probings would determine how chatty I\u2019ll be with them.\n\n3. You can\u2019t really tell for certain, not without asking. In my experience, I find people tend to open up a bit after telling them that I very much prefer to know than not, and I don\u2019t get upset easily so it\u2019s okay to inform me anytime they\u2019re bothered by something about the roleplay. \n\n4. It\u2019s not a bad thing at all. I have a motto: if someone is not telling me whether or not I\u2019m annoying/pushy, I\u2019ll continue to gauge their communication with me, adjust and move on. Any overthinking about what their actual opinion of me is would use too much of my brain and emotional power and I\u2019d rather not bother. Besides, I tell people at the very start to be honest with me. If they would rather withhold their words, I\u2019ll not attempt to pretend I can read minds.\n\n5. There\u2019s no set answer. *You* will have to set that boundary yourself. Personally, I check in every 2 weeks, and if there isn\u2019t an answer OOC by the 3rd poke, I give them another 2 weeks and then drop. If they seem to be cherry picking who to reply to, the most likely reason is that their muse is hitting out of order. Decide for yourself how long you\u2019re willing to wait, and if that amount of time have passed with no response, give them a nudge. Decide for yourself also how many times you\u2019re willing to nudge people.",
