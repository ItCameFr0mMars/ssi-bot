I deal with is constantly and it's suuchh an annoyance, it makes me so so uncomfortable and when I have to reiterate that *I* am *not* my character they'll always act like they were slipping up and they respect me but end up slipping right back into it trying to pretend it's me and them. Very uncomfortable and unsettling, I once came upon someone who wanted me to roleplay as a girl he knew in real life while he played as himself. I pretended to be okay with it because he was giving people her instagram so they'd know what she looked like, so I got her instagram and sent her his username and everything he was doing and told her to private her account. People are constantly trying to live out real life fantasies through roleplay and end up dragging unwilling people into it by lying to them constantly.\n\nHonestly, at this point I don't even roleplay with people that do 1st person anymore. Which is a shame because I'm sure there are plenty of 1st person writers who know how to act normally but these types of people just kinda ruin it for them. I end up blocking a lot of people because of it, you're not alone!",

And as someone who posts ads and more often has them responded to, rather than responding to other people's it's bothersome at the least. I clearly start 3rd person as what I write as and what I want them to use as well. And then it will still come up when in the planning phase or, for some audacious / shady people, in their first response or starter post. First person is such a turn off for RP for me, and I don't mean that in a smutty sense. It just makes me not want to RP with people who use it anymore.   \n\n\nI can't comment on if they're self inserts because if they are IDK these people's names ages appearance etc. So as far as I'm aware none are self inserts. Though the one time someone did try to use a self insert with me it was a big \"No thank you\" from me.",
