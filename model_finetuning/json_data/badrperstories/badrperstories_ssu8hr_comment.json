            "body": "Hi, and welcome!\n\nWhere to look heavily depends on the type of RP you're interested in and over which medium you feel comfortable writing. If you're looking for primarily NSFW, there are loads of subreddits that cater to helping people find partners. If you'd like to roleplay over Discord, you can check out [disboard.org](https://disboard.org) and search the \"roleplay\" tag to find servers. Do you want to do group RP or 1x1? Do you want anime or dnd style play?\n\nIf you don't know, don't worry. You can pop into servers or forums or subreddits and get a feel for things before jumping in. Your preferences should be obvious to you as soon as you see what's out there.\n\nYou'll want to start by searching for ads catered to your medium of choice. So, if you want to write over Kik, you'll want to go to subreddits that advertise to Kik RPers. Discord is probably the most popular in terms of chat interfaces, both for groups and one on one (1x1). But there are forums, there's Tumblr, there's writing back and forth over email... Once you know which one works for you, you can also Google \"(medium) RP partner search.\" Or, for example, \"discord rp partner search\" or \"discord rp group.\"",

            "body": "The first step is likely finding out how literate you are, and what it is you would like in a roleplay. I use the subreddits that are here on reddit.\n\nAs far as introductions go, put a little effort into it! Introduce yourself, tell them about some of your interests, what drew you to their idea, and what they can expect from you. (Post lengths, literacy, timezone, etc)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to it, and you\u2019ll often meet people that perceive an idea differently from you. So try to make it as clear as possible what it is you want from your partner, and what they can expect from you. You might come by someone who will ghost you, however that is completely normal. Some people simply don\u2019t inform you when something is unsatisfactory and therefore don\u2019t try to resolve it! So try to be communicative with your future partners so you two can stay on the same page. \n\nThis post might\u2019ve been pretty sloppy, though I\u2019d be happy to help you get started and whatnot. Can shoot me a message, if you\u2019d like!",

Though granted, Reddit Search function is kinda shit.\n\nMany people use Reddit, there are also forums such as GaiaOnline, Barbermonger, you could also try your luck on LiveJournal or Discord servers.\n\nOn that note, if you are freshly 18 then probably quite a few adults would be hesitant to write with you, simply because it's such a convenient age to pretend to be for a minor. Especially here in my country, where you finish high school at the age of 19, so an 18 year old's schedule and daily affairs are largely the same as that of a minor.\n\nSome people also set their lower limit as 21, some even won't roleplay with people under the age of 25.",

            "body": "Before joining a roleplaying group, I would suggest really thinking about what you want you write/what you don't want to write. Which genres would you like to do? Are there any topics you find particularly interesting? Do you want to join groups with multiple people, do you prefer writing a roleplay with one partner, or would you like to try both? How many words do you prefer to write, and how often do you think can you write (daily, twice a week, once a week, once a month...?) Do you want to create your own characters, or write characters from an existing fandom? You need to consider all of that before we can give you advice about which roleplaying site might be a good fit for your preferences.\n\nRoleplaying sites have different rules, so you can't really say: This is how you always introduce yourself, and this is what you always have to do. Some sites might require roleplaying samples, your own character, or proof that you're not underage if you want to join, while others do not.\n\nThe good thing is that most roleplaying sites and servers have their rules written down somewhere, including stuff like: What do I need to join the roleplay/to create a search. Just read them thoroughly after you joined the server/site.",
