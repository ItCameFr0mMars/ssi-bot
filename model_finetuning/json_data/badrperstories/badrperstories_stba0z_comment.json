If people are criticised, they often get defensive, and lash out. Especially if they don't know or care for the person at all, and aren't able to get that you're actually trying to help them (at least thats what you tried in the beginning). I doubt that they learned anything from this conversation, it seems like they don't even get what you're trying to say most of the time lol\n\nNot saying you did anything wrong, but I think that conversations like that just get more and more draining the more you get involved.

The people I know that write one-liners often do extremely quick and dialogue-based responses, and 'meet' online for the whole afternoon/evening. So it was easier for them if their partner also replied with one-liners, because they could read the reply faster. They were always really excited to get a response, even if it was just something like 'You're such a dick., Miranda whispered.' And honestly, good for them.\n\nIf they wrote together with partners that wrote one paragraph or multiple paragraphs, they often didn't really vibe with them. They weren't like 'Nice, Irohsgranddaughter gave me so much to work with', but often found the added information either boring, or they thought that to much insight into a character's mind killed the element of surprise for them.\n\nThe only problem that arises is when people who write one-liners can't understand that not everyone enjoys the same aspects of roleplaying that they do, or approach people who write a lot more so than they do. This often happens when they join new communities after writing in a community that prefers oneliners for a long time. Often, they can't even understand why one-liners are off-putting for a lot of roleplayers. Or wonder why everyone in this new community seems so uptight, when in their old community no one made a fuss about it.",
