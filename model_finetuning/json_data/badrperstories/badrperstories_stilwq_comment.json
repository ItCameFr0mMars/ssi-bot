Like, one-hitting my characters and rewriting what I'd put in my posts to make their characters better than mine. If your partner's character is still getting some time in the spotlight and has the focus in some posts, then you're probably doing fine.\n\nI'm not really sure that you can focus too much on a character when you don't know anything about them that you *can* focus on. Maybe ask your partner to give you a few details that you can use in your next post or in the rest of the plot? Though first, I'd ask if they want to share the focus more. They might be fine with how things are going.\n\nI don't know your rp preferences, but you could offer to double, if you're interested in that, and have your secondary plot be focused on your partner's character. It sounds like you've been having this kind of dynamic for years, however, and if so, I doubt they'd still be around if they didn't like it.",

They don't care about how their partner feels as long as their own character gets the limelight.  You care about your partner having fun.  It's just maybe a little uncomfortable for you because you're not used to it.  And you can also just ask your partner if they want more focus on their character.",
