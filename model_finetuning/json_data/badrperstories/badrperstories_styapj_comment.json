But you can definitely tell when it's a \"Once in a while misreading\" or \"Okay this person just isn't reading or registering all of my posts.\"   \n\n\nWhen I'm RPing with my longest standing RP partner, if they're unsure they ask for clarification, or in some cases they ask me if I mind them controlling my character slightly to move them to a better position for the post they have in mind.  Now sometimes he misreads so he gets in wrong and normally I say nothing when it happens and just roll with it because I get it's an accident.  \n\n\nBut then there are other people I've tried out as partners in the past year and some have almost consistently all the time had my character standing when she's sitting or laying down when she's sitting up etc etc and I'm like, c'mon my guy, it's not that hard to read stuff and ask for clarification if you really don't understand the position I'm describing in my posts.",
