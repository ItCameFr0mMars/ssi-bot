Of course you didn't want to be \"stuck in the passenger seat\" while he \"sauntered around\" *as* your OC. This would be fine and dandy if it was a mutual kink, but as soon as you expressed you saw it as god-modding, it was crystal clear you weren't into this idea. He should have immediately stopped pushing it and acting exasperated because you dared to want the autonomy to write your own character. His promise not to disrespect your limits was pretty meaningless after he couldn't take no for an answer.\n\nTL;DR: It isn't his idea that makes him a bad RPer; it's the refusal to drop it once you expressed you weren't interested in it.",
