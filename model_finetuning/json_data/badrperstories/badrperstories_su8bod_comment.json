            "body": "They appear to have quite the obsession where they are dissociation and bkending irl interested with rp interest. Its easy to do this, but that also means they believe in their mind they are connected to that character and in general become overly possessive. In my honest opinion, I would point out their behavior and remind them its only a character. If they feel attacked or start to create tension I woukd bail ship as quick as possible.\n\nI've created a lot of characters in my time rolellaying and one partner went so far as to tell me I wasn't allowed to use that character with other people. The problem was we had a group thing going on over at Amino and others woukd like to befriend or even flirt with my OC. As many times as I denied their advances that one partner still continued to breathe down my neck and ruined our progress and relationship, not only as friends but partners. Nobody can claim or singularly posess and character. They are in the wrong with this and I hope you manage to work things out.",

That is quite the problem you've got and honestly... I think it's gonna be impossible for them to let you write that character. Even if you tell them it's come time for you to get a turn, I doubt that, if it'd even happen, they're gonna be able to deal with it. There is a chance of course, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. I mean, they already shut down as soon as you so much as talk about the character. I dont think you necessarily should drop them if you enjoy to RP with them, however I do think their behavior is not cool and you should definitely bring it up because it clearly does take away from your enjoyment.  No matter how good a partner is to write with, when something causes you to struggle it's never ever gonna be worth putting up with it in the long run. I speak from experience. The best suggestion I can make is to try and find other people to play that character with.",

            "body": "lol I've been obsessed before! But there's grown-up ways of handling canon character obsession, especially in fandom spaces. I found it really fun to find others who appreciated the same canon character as I did, and swap fiction about them. It was fun taking turns RPing the character with our OCs, with the assumption that it was parallel universes. Hell, most RP fun I ever had was when an RP partner and I arranged a parallel universe magical crossover! \n\nI have also found that in these spaces, people get very unhealthy about \"writing the canon character *correctly*\" and \"thou shalt accept my headcanon and/or interpretation as holy and incontestable\" and junk like that. I think it's more fun to engage alternate theories? Friendly debates, if there is a debate? People get so weird, though.\n\nI'd be looking for other partners to play that IC with. (So weird calling it IC, I'm used to it being In Character). Trying to push it with this partner will likely get a lot of drama started. No joke, your partner seems weird af. It is unlikely they will see reason. Until you find another partner, though, you may have to set a boundary with this partner. No talking about their OC and IC together, or perhaps even at all. If it can't be handled maturely, then, perhaps it shouldn't be handled at all.\n\nThey act like a child with a toy, and IT'S MINE, no sharing! When they found it on the floor of the daycare.",

            "body": "There were a few comments I agreed with on this post, but I love this one because I learned some things in the first paragraph!\n\nOP, I think this is the correct advice: look for another partner you can write this character with. I don't think the person your post is about is ready to hand Interesting Character over, and if they *do,* it might be really uncomfortable for them. I feel like they should 100% seek help about this and it doesn't mean you're in the wrong, but you might not have as good a time as you're thinking once you realize your writing partner is internally freaking out over IC the whole time.\n\nThe above comment is right about another thing: you may be better off to stop discussing IC with this person. It's completely on them to work on their problem, but it's probably best if you remove yourself from the overobsessive equation. You can let them know you don't feel it's healthy to discuss IC anymore and suggest writing different characters altogether.\n\nHonestly, I think your partner needs to take a break from fandom and roleplay altogether while they sort this out, but of course you can only control your own behavior.",
