            "selftext": "Sooo...\n\nI was in a wolf quest pack roleplay. My character was an omega female who basically had a disease that mostly affected the legs. Therefore, my character, having this disease, only had three working legs. There were about 6 wolves I believe. Everything was going perfectly fine... until something strange arrived. (I'll name this kiddo mateplz)\n\nMeet Mateplz.\n\nHe came into the role-play and immediately  asked me:\n\"Want to start a pack?\"\nMy character was supposed to be grumpy and tough, but that's hard to stick to when you get asked this. So I rejected him nicely and acted dazed and confused afterward.\n\nSo you may think this story end here right?\n\nNOPE WRONG ANSWER!\n\nMateplz will not stop asking, or should I say begging me. He begged and begged but, to no avail. The leader eventually came in and asked what he was doing in the territory. Unfortunately, I had to go take care of something and when I came back, he is whining and moping about how he is treated so horribly.\n\nNow for the bonus story! (woo!)\nNot so long ago, I decided to play as a wolf called A12, a lab experiment that recently escaped. A12 is terrified of people and is very submissive. So, when I entered the role-play, I asked everyone to treat me badly due to the fact that I'm an omega.\n\nBoy did I not suspect what was going to happen...\n\nThe leader, and the majority of people there, agrees to this. There was only one person who couldn't do this because it doesn't fit their character and of course, I let her pass. (She's a very sweet person) So, we role-played for a bit, but I noticed the leader was getting more violent with me and... seemed... interested in me... romantically? Then things escalated FAST!\n\nOne dreadful day, (or night idk) the leader came back from hunting and RAPED my character. Yep, you read that right. Raped my character with no consent from me or warning or anything! Everyone was silent and eventually, (after a hush of silence went over the roo- ugh I can't do this poetic b.s.) we all left the room and the rp died.\n\nMoral of the story: People are weird with love... especially strangers who rp.",
