            "selftext": "I entered a chat with a random other RPer. Right off the bat they threw out a scenario: You're only a few inches tall and you find yourself in a neighborhood (from memory, I noped out of the chat so I can't quote). \n\nI joke that either you'd die from ant poison treatment on the lawn or a stray cat might find you, both of which are bad. It got a laugh and we chatted and continued. \n\nIt then goes on to perhaps the tiny person is found by a young boy. Then perhaps traded by boys. And this isn't mutual role play, this is more like a question prompt. Describe the boy. What about his friends? Siblings? What about if a boys soccer team found the tiny person? What if they decide to punish him for attempted escape???\n\nMy RP partner admitted to liking \"being in peril\" but after I told them I wasn't into it things didn't change. I even brought up the strange focus on young boys but he persisted. I ended up noping right out of the chat. I still feel weird :S",
