            "selftext": "This one is fresh off one of my usual roleplay sites.\n\n\nThings start off fairly normal when I connect to my random partner. We chat and exchange descriptions and discuss potential scenarios and plots. However, something from his description immediately caught my attention: his character is a seventeen-year-old warlord and master tactician. Now, that's an immediate red flag for me, but it was 4am and I really wasn't in a position to be too picky and gave it a shot.\n\n\nBoy, was I in for a ride.\n\n\nThe scenario was pretty simple. My partner wanted a minor conflict of some kind between our characters. His character, let's call him \"E,\" was to have a desire to attack my character's (let's call her \"M\"') temple. They would negotiate and we'd have roleplay. Things didn't end up going that way, however.\n\n\nMy partner starts us out with E walking right through the front door of the temple. Naturally, since it's late at night, M intercepts him, ready to fight if necessary, and asks why he's trespassing on her order's sacred grounds. This culminates in E trying to escape into the temple and M quickly intercepting him due to just knowing the floorplan better. E gets knocked out for interrogation (as my partner heavily implied he wanted), and that's where the fun begins.\n\n\nThe interrogation was pretty straightforward in the beginning. E was trying to make excuses while M was trying to figure out what he was doing. This quickly turned into E threatening my character with magic (this was after mentioning earlier in the RP that he'd have to rely on physical attacks because magic would be ineffective against mages). Now, M wasn't really phased, considering E was in a small stone room with her and her two guards at the door. It was a classic situation where either E was out-matched or he was going to ass-pull some great act of teenage badassery and escape.\n\n\nE logically went with the latter, leaping over M, pinning her wrists, covering her mouth, and lunging for the door... all in one post. M's guards just grabbed him by the wrist and attacked him. E apparently broke free and ran through the door than was somehow teleported back, which my partner all chose to write. Seeing as he was trapped, E used illusion magic to duplicate himself and then challenged M to a duel. M refused, having no reason to fight the captured man, and because I was under the impression this was a negotiation-focused roleplay.\n\n\nAfter being refused his duel, E presents to me the biggest ass-pull of all: literally teleporting out of the building with the book he had come to steal. Of course, this made a lot of sense as he had never had the chance to take such an item and had been searched and disarmed before being interrogated.\n\n\nAfter that, well, I apparently took too long to reply and he left. I had had enough by then anyway. Dealing with all the dialogue like \"I can easily make you experience the worst pain you could imagine,\" \"Clock's ticking, better get going,\" and the like was honestly kind of draining.",
