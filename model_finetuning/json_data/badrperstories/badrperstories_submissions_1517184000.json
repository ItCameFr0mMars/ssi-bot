            "selftext": "So I have been rping for years now. I love it and the world it opens up and always you to create and be part of. I have come across so many good and bad partners. Let me say finding a good one these days is like trying to find a unicorn in your back yard!\n\nMy lastest irritant is from a prompt I advertised a few days back. I had a huge feed back for it and was thrilled. I typically pick through and go for the ones who put a lot of flair into their message to me. I figure if they can be so descriptive and pumped in their message it will correlate to rp right? Well boy I was wrong with this one. \n\nWe started off discussing the rp and what we want to set up and our characters. Well it started off good. I was intrigued. I soon started to notice him taking control of MC actions. BIG no-go for me. While I understand a littke implying or saying \"mc stumbled out of the way when yc brushed by them\" happens. THAT I am completely fine with....what I am not is them saying MC did something without even asking. His post was pretty much dictating what my character did in the situation they were in. What is the point of having a partner if YOU are just going to rp mine for me? \n\nOn top of that I start to notice he is a rp clinger. While there are times I can rapid fire a few post that is not a constant for me. I have a full time job on top of having a life. I noticed this when I received a message of him saying 'hey'. I dismissed it because I was out and about and would reply when I could. So then 3 more came fairly soon after that. I promptly sent a messaging letting him know I was not on and was out so I would get a post up accordingly when I returned home. All good right? Pfft. So a 'no prob' was giving in response to that. The next day I was at work and couldn't post. Message came and I didn't respond. When I told him I was just off the clock and would post shortly my reply was 'that's fine. When do you think you will be free?' ...... Well I literally just said I would post shortly. Is it so hard to understand not everyone is capable of rping 24/7? \n\nI don't know if this partner is going to work out. The constant messages if I am online might seem like me just being bitchy. Though you should know that my full time job was included in my prompt post to allow people to know I could/would not be around all hours of the day. Anybody else have situations like this before? Rp is supposed to be fun not stressful...",
