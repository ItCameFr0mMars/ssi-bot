            "selftext": "So I've been modding a Pern RP board for about two and a half years now, and a member there for a little more than four years. For those of you who don't know about Pern, it's a mostly-medieval-styled world in which people bonded to telepathic dragons fight this parasitic burny fungus-stuff that falls from the sky called Thread, protecting everyone else. Great fun, because who doesn't like dragons? (Actually, we'll get to that.) Most of the RP revolves around day-to-day life of the people at the Weyrs (think small towns populated by the aforementioned riders and dragons and, for lack of a better explanation, their support staff), dragon hatchings, and occasionally the overarching plot.\n\nBut after so long, well, I have *seen some things*. \n\n# WTF Character Concepts\n\nWe've got a review system in place that's stricter than some places, looser than others; we pretty much expect to have to guide players a lot with first characters, mostly on site-specific history (or general Pern culture for the newbies), and it gets much easier after that. I really can't stress enough that the *vast majority* of what I see is either totally fine from the start or very easily fixed. But then there's the things that... Aren't.\n\n**Lightning Strikes Leave Cool Scars** - This one was just *weird*. In addition to having several contradictions in their personality section, the character had apparently been struck by lightning. This had literally no effect on her life save that she had cool scars and a white steak in her hair.  \n\n**MMA is Totally a Thing Here** - One in a long line of players who come from other backgrounds (which is fine!) completely failing to get the point. This character was apparently a master of their own style of martial arts, which was far superior to other ones because it was a combination of them all, and I'm *really* not sure what this player was expecting because this is clearly not a setting where that's going to come up more than once in a blue moon. \n\n**Mechanical Dragons** - Pern is a decidedly low-tech world on most sites. Metal and wood are scarce and valuable, and are generally used for more important things. But no. We've had people asking if their characters can invent mechanical dragons. Not attempt (which would totally be cool with us so long as it never came to fruition), but actually *succeed*, and in the near future. We actually had to add a line to our FAQ about this. I still don't get it. \n\n**Dragon-Hating Candidates** - This one is weird. I get that characters may have reasons for hating dragons, and even play one who does. But Candidates (which are young people who are attempting to get a dragon) are doing what they do *by choice*. If they honestly hate dragons, they wouldn't do it. You can send them to the Weyr and make them get over their hatred in another role first, or use a Stands Impression post prize (I did it for a character who was *afraid* of dragons), but why in the name of all that is holy are they in that position? It's never due to family pressure either, which would actually be a situation that made sense. \\*throws hands in the air\\*\n\n**Badly-Adapted Expies** - Look, we love expies on this site. We have no problem with them, and some of them are much beloved by the site as a whole. But some people don't quite seem to get that the setting means their histories *do* need to be adapted. \"Well my character had an eye patch in the original canon and when he took it off he got more powerful, so he's an elite fighter when he takes it off and he always trains with it on\". That's... Not how things work. Ever. Please adapt your anime tropes to something more believable. We're pretty flexible. We have freaking dragons flying around for heaven's sake. \n\n# How *Dare* Your Character Act In-Character?!\n\n**But My Character Is Special!** - There are IC rules that characters are supposed to follow, but can totally break because, well, not everyone is a goody two-shoes. Consequences of this are purely IC, and we have a great love of making our characters do dishes. But for one player, apparently being told that a character wouldn't bend the rules for their character was too much to understand. \"But she's almost old enough!\" In-charge character is known to be a stickler and cannot care less. \"But he should bend them for her because her parents died!\" No. \n\n**Your Character Can't Do My Character's Job Before My Character Existed!** - We have a few authority teacher-type positions, and occasionally if one doesn't have a character in it we'll have a related position cover both. This isn't usually an issue... Except that apparently a player got offended that another character had filled in and doled out IC punishments to willing players.... before her character even existed OOC. \n\n# Shiny-Hunters\n\nPern seems to be infested by this particular breed of \"my character must be the most special\" roleplayer. They seek acknowledgement by site admins that their character is the best, and only want \"shiny\" dragons: golds or mutations (Pern has this hierarchy that goes gold &gt; bronze &gt; brown &gt; blue &gt; green; we have two extra colors thrown in, as well as one-off mutations, but the hierarchy still applies). This leads to some *joyous* moments when people don't get what they want. I'll note that we don't have a problem with characters who have gold-only on their questionnaires, and in fact *actively encourage* people to put that down if that's what they want. We've had multiple characters with that restriction get a gold dragon in the past. It's only the ones that get over the top, or lie in their apps and then ragequit that are a problem.\n\nLuckily, for the ones who flounce immediately upon being given a dragon that they deem \"not good enough\", we have a rule that dragons will go back in the adoption bucket unless there's very good reason not to. Many of them have since gone to players who love them dearly.\n\n**I Can't Wait for *My* Gold to Hatch** - This particular player (who specified on their questionnaire that any color was acceptable!) made a Tumblr post about how she couldn't wait for her obvious self-insert character to get the gold at the site's upcoming hatching. She did not, got the most adorable brown instead. Needless to say, she immediately flounced. \n\n**You Gave Me a Fodder Dragon!** - Another player who who would accept \"any\" dragon (but apparently only a bronze would really do) *raged* at being given a sweet little green because she was \"a fodder dragon\". While this would have been a reasonable IC belief due to site history, this was *clearly not the case OOC*. Said player also immediately quit. \n\n**Is *This* One My Gold?** - A member with an in-denial trans-feminine character would only accept gold for their character (which is fine, so long as the player acknowledges this can take a while due to how we write dragons and then match; dragons are not written specifically for individual characters and so a match may not be available immediately) wanted a gold specifically \"to fix their gender issues\", since at the time golds were only going to female characters (this does include a trans woman with a gold dragon). Admin was weirded out by this request, and not about to bend over backwards to accommodate something that made him uncomfortable. Player eventually quit, to several folks' relief.\n\n**Albinos Stick Together?** - This one isn't the absolute worst, but still stuck out as weird and snowflake-y. A player wanted their albino character to get either a white dragon or an albino gold. Player at least totally understood and acknowledged this was a slightly weird thing to ask for though. \n\n## You're a Bad Person and You Should Feel Bad\n\nLuckily even most of our most ridiculous situations resolve themselves. But some... Do not, because the people involved are terrible people.\n\n**What's Wrong with Sexually Harassing the Staff?** - We had a guy who was trouble from the start, had some strange expectations of what should happen (\"he's an elite fighter so he can't get hurt by dragons\"), but whatever, even people with weird expectations sometimes come around. But then he made some sexually suggestive comments to another mod, after she'd already expressed discomfort about it. He got *extremely* offended by the sternly-worded warning he got from admin (\"can't you take a joke?!\"), and immediately and publicly quit. We took great joy in deleting his account. \n\n**It's a Coincidence, I Swear** - A player let us know that another player's application had large sections that were completely copy-pasted from her character. Plagiarizer tried to pass it off as \"coincidence\" since the characters had some shared experiences in history. So we ran it through a plagiarism checker, and it gave a pretty strong result. To prove a point, also ran two staff characters who were siblings and grew up together through the same tool. Zero plagiarism detected. Player who was plagiarized asked us to be lenient on the plagiarizer and so, in respect of her wishes, she wasn't banned immediately (which is our usual method) but instead told she could have no dragons from the upcoming Hatching. This was apparently too harsh a consequence for blatant stealing, so she quit. Good riddance. \n\n**Suspicious Silence** - We have sometimes had people leave and re-join years later. This is fairly common in such a small community when you've got a long-running site. We don't mind it at all. When usernames change and we recognize a previous character, we usually send a PM to the person to confirm that they're the same person. This has happened several times and in all cases but one we get back a \"yep, that was me!\" and we generally trust them. But when the person is online, reads the PM, and then immediately disappears never to be heard from again (and the original player of that character didn't have any issues on-site)... Yeah, you stole that character, didn't you?",

            "selftext": "As with my other posts, this one takes place on World of Warcraft. However, this time we will be taking a trip to the distant past, back before yours truly was the absolute roleplay mastermind you see today (citation needed).\n\nA few years ago I had the displeasure of being in a guild with a warlock, who we will refer to as V. Not for Vendetta, most likely for Very sad. You see V was lonely, and it truly showed. He spent a vast amount of his time in game trying to invite different females (at least, female characters) to join his character in a friendly walk or to his home for dinner. Of course, nothing is wrong with being flirtatious and trying to throw some moves of a lovely lady, but everything is wrong with what he did when he was inevitably rejected.\n\nYou see he had this horrible habit of getting rejected and hitting all of us in the feels with the \u201cO-oh.\u201d You know the one. With the dejected face and the hung head, as if you were told that you were not accepted into the college of your dreams (the college, in this case, being the chick\u2019s butt I suppose). From there he would always, WITHOUT FAIL, walk away and log off. It got to the point where, to keep his character engaged in the conversations, girls would just pretend they missed the post over and over again. Of course, this eventually worked. He got a female to take pity on him and come back to his home. Fast forward a few ooc days and they were like two peas in a pod, constantly uncomfortably joking about where and when and how and with what appendage they made sweet meat-lovies. It was just as sickening as you\u2019d imagine.\n\nExcept the female was not happy. Instead of getting to rp with people, she was constantly being dragged out on 1 on 1 dates and was watching her badass warrior girl he turned into a lovey house wife. So she did the right thing and had her toon end it. If you think V was sad when a girl rejected him, you haven\u2019t seen what he does when he loses a girlfriend.\n\nHe climbs the tallest tower in the area and invites everyone there to rp. Once they get there, they are suddenly trying to stop a sad wizard from throwing himself off the balcony and to his death. Now I don\u2019t know about you all, but there are some things I don\u2019t consider worth rping. Your character dying, in some cases, can definitely push a plot forward (though often you only feel empty afterwards). But throwing yourself off a tower in a suicidal act of revenge is NOT worth rping.\n\nSo there V was, standing in the balcony, basically wanting us all to blow him and make him feel good so he didn\u2019t jump. But I\u2019d had enough of him. The girl was a good friend of mine and it very well pissed me off that he had tried to water her character down into just a wife. So I said what we were all thinking.\n\nV: I think I am just going to jump and end it all.\nMe: Do a flip.\n\nThis did not go over well with him. After an intense and expletive ridden rant in guild chat, he promptly made his character jump (which didn\u2019t kill him anyway because it wasn\u2019t high enough) and quit the guild. That was really the last I saw of him. Later on I\u2019d learn that he regularly pestered the girl offline as well, so much that he nearly fucked up her marriage due to his incessant discord messages, and I knew her husband to be a pretty chill dude. But I guess when you have a guy constantly flooding your inbox with sappy bullshit, your S/O is bound to get suspicious.\n\nSorry for the length of this one. I tend to get a bit carried away when it comes to the crazies you meet in the rp world. I\u2019ll end this with a question of sorts. What would you have done in this situation?\n\n",

            "selftext": "[Volume 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/5vcuv4/a_collection_of_bad_players/)\n\n[Volume 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/66r07m/mr_wulffs_bad_players_vol_2/)\n\n[Volume 2.5-ish?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/6cdzq0/three_short_stories_from_a_slice_of_life_roleplay/)\n\nHello again, it's been awhile but life is weird, so I'm back with a few more bad players. These ones are from all around the board, no one specific roleplay, not all of the roleplays listed are mine, etc.\n\nSo without further ado, here they are. There will be a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\n* **Gimmick, the Gimmicky Player**\n\nWhat is it with players trying to be gimmicky? And by gimmicky, I mean wanting to make themselves stand out so badly, that it becomes blatantly obvious that they're trying way too hard to be \"unique\" and \"original.\"\n\nGimmick was a player who joined one of my many fantasy roleplays and decided that his character was going to be a warrior. His warrior was going to be clad in jet black plate armor...Okay, unlikely but not impossible. And then he said that he was going to wield a perfectly normal steel sword...With a blood red blade. The sword's blade was pure solid red and yet the sword wasn't magical. He clearly stated that it was a normal non-magical everyday sword in his character application.\n \nI asked him why the heck his sword had a red blade when it was just normal steel, and he replied by telling me that he didn't know why...*What?*\nSo a player gives his character such a \"unique\" weapon, and yet he doesn't know why and it's also a non-magical weapon that pretty much *ANYONE* could get their hands on at their local blacksmith? So **WHY** was the blade **RED?!**\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, he decided to change the sword's design and color. And once he did, I couldn't comprehend what he was saying. Since I had saved what he said to my notepad, I'm just going to paste what he wrote down and share it all with you. Maybe we can try and picture this work of art together!\n\n&gt;\"He has a longsword, which is straight until the end. It is also considered in \"three parts\". The middle, which is a bit thinner than a normal sword, is red, and it is pointed. The \"upper\" part of the blade, which the top curves inward. The \"lower\" part, which is shorter than the \"upper\", but taller than the middle, also curves, but only with the outward facing edge. Both the upper and lower are black.\"\n\nDid you get all that? Do you have any idea what he's talking about? If you do, please have a few scientists show me with a pop up book whilst explaining it to me, because I honestly cannot wrap my mind around the design he came up with.\n\nThe same player in another one of my roleplays wrote down that his character had two \"longsword-rapiers\" that were normal steel, but they had blue blades; which first of all, what are longsword-rapiers? Are they two-handed rapiers? Are they longswords with a swept-hilt or knuckle-guard? Are they rapiers with the blades of longswords? Maybe longswords with the blades of rapiers? The world may never know. Secondly, **WHY WERE HIS NORMAL BLADES SUCH \"UNIQUE\" COLORS?!**\n\nMy guess is that he wanted the weapons to be enchanted with something(that was most likely rule breaking to several degrees), but didn't want to say anything until some moment where he could say \"Oh by the way, my sword is magic!\" Which I would have gleefully shot down, as if you tell me that it isn't magic at character creation, then I will say it isn't magic throughout character progression.\n\n\n* **Moody, the Bikini Paladin**\n\nI don't remember much about Moody's character, at least not in terms of personality or story anyway. That should say a lot.\n\nNo, what stood out about Moody's character was her occupation, design, weapon, trinkets, and abilities. See Moody was a player who didn't exactly know what the term \"balance\" meant. She would often talk and/or preach about balance, but her problem was that she was very good at talking the talk, but she couldn't walk the walk to save her life.\n\nMoody's character was a paladin. Now when you think of a paladin in fantasy settings, what is the first thing to come to your head other than the paladin stereotype that is obsessed with justice and light? You'll probably think about a character that is kind and modest, yet firm. Willing to help others, outgoing, social, easy to talk to, ready to be uplifting, a defender of the weak and helpess, warrior of light that fights against the evil and wicked, etc.\n\nYeeeeeaaaahhhh, Moody wasn't any of the above. Moody was, as the name would imply, moody, as well as immodest, unwilling to help others, antisocial, difficult to talk to, always tearing others down, rarely helped the weak and helpess unless their lives were actually on the line, etc, etc. The real kicker is that despite supposedly being a paladin, you know, a holy warrior in service to God, the character wasn't actually a member of the church so far as I know. Heck the character acted more like a militaristic Hollywood atheist most of the time. (Which I should add, an atheist existing in a fantasy world where one or more creator deities created the universe and have been *proven* to exist is one of the absolute stupidest things I've ever heard of.)\n\nMoody's character, despite being a paladin, wore the ever popular plate-mail bikini and didn't think twice about whether it was viable armor or not. She also wielded a gigantic sword that would make Cloud fans squee with delight; the sword also had a square shaped blade, and nevermind that the size of the sword would make it unwieldy and heavy as all get out, because she of course was strong enough to wield it with one hand!\nMoody was also incredibly fast and had super high pain tolerance, to the point where she wouldn't bat an eye if she was shot in the stomach by an arrow or bolt. She was also untouchable and one of the best if not **THE** best in combat, because her player wouldn't allow her to take damage and always autohit others.\n\nAnd lastly, we have the cream of the crop, the cherry on the cake, the figgy pudding on Christmas Eve! Moody had a magical gauntlet that increased her speed, agility, strength, and endurance to a capacity beyond that which any mortal could comprehend. I say that last part about mortals being unable to comprehend it, not because Moody wrote it that way, but because of how she wrote the power of the gauntlet.\n\nIn terms of speed; enemy soldier swings a sword at her? One of two scenarios plays out. He finds himself striking empty air and suddenly falls to pieces in a bloody mess, or she zips behind him possibly leaving an afterimage for several seconds while she disarms him or kills him.\n\nIn terms of agility; a sea of arrows falls from the sky towards her? She can easily dodge every last one of them. No problemo.\n\nIn terms of strength; she gets angry? She can punch a crater into the ground and cause showers of boulders and debris to rain from the sky with the force of the blow. She mostly did this with her sword though.\n\nIn terms of endurance; nothing can hurt her. Seriously, the character never once showed any signs of pain no matter how much damage you dealt to her.\n\nAnd lastly, what was Moody's player like? Well, she was an ass. I'm sorry but that's the nicest way I can put it. She was constantly rude to others, belittled others, tried to tell others how their characters should be played, etc, etc.\n\nI'm glad to have finally just ducked out and left Moody behind.\n\n* **Snobby, the Effortless Player**\n\nSnobby was a player who gets his name for being, as you already guessed, snobby. He was a player who's first appearance on a roleplay I had made was to post in the out of character chat telling me how he had orginally thought my roleplay was \"cool\" up until he got to the magic system and essentially passive aggressively told me that it was a bad idea due to it not being to his liking. And he then left it at that. Now I am a quite patient GM and whilst sticks and stones may break my bones, words can't and most likely never will hurt me. So I calmly explained the magic system to him and assured him that it was a means of balancing magic rather than just letting players do whatever they wanted to do with it.\n\nI didn't hear from him for a few minutes and then an application suddenly turned up. My mods and I looked at it, and if I was capable of raising one eyebrow, I would have. His application consisted of four very small sentences that barely described the character. The character's personality was one sentence with only three traits. Those traits being that he was quiet, he didn't make friends easily, and he tried to save people. His bio was only three short sentences that boiled down to him being raised in a church and only ever having spoken when spoken to.\n\nI told him as nicely as I could that his character application had to have more detail, as he gave so little information that it was difficult to picture his character and it was also so obscure that there was literally nothing to the character which made it feel more akin to some background NPC than an actual character.\n\nI received the following message from him.\n\n&gt;\"Nope, not putting more detail, there is absolutely no point. This is how I always make character apps. I am not going to waste two hours to make one that is detailed, when mine was already good enough.\"\n\nNow as I said, I am patient with my players. But one thing I am not, is lenient towards snobbish or passive aggressive players that take up a \"my way or the highway\" attitude towards me when I am the one that created the roleplay and ultimately decide whether or not someone is permitted to play within it. If they are going to take such an attitude with the one who created the roleplay, then they will do nothing but cause trouble in character and out of character for everyone involved. As such, I will not brook such behavior.\n\nI banned him.\n\n* **Flirty and Moon, the Forgetful Man and the Racist Elf**\n\nSo Flirty and Moon were players who joined a fantasy roleplay I was part of and cemented themselves as bad players the moment they showed up.\n\nThe setting was the Forgotten Realms, and it was taking place in a land where parties of characters were forming up in a tavern to do something. I don't really remember what was going on exactly, but players were all forming different parties and heading out into the surrounding areas for whatever reason.\n\nMy character was a Half-Orc who stood at a height of 6'8\", and he was built like a brick-house. I mention this because I had him take a seat at the table of a lone Moon Elf who was just waiting for someone to party up with her. I quickly learned that this was probably a mistake, as the first thing she had her character do was think to herself. What did she say in her head? Well she said.\n\n&gt;\"Ugh, of all things, *why* did it have to be a *Half-Orc?*\"\n\nI could already see this wasn't going to end well, but I decided to have my character make some friendly small talk, to which she mostly just nodded at and didn't really add anything to it. Whenever she did speak, it was usually something dismissive with an added bit of inner monologue that was either passive aggressive or just straight up hostile. And then Flirty showed up.\n\nFlirty's character was a Human of about average height and was dressed like a flamboyant(though not colorful) nobleman. He took a seat next to my character and began speaking with the Moon Elf about whatever it was the parties were supposed to be doing. I decided to let them have their conversation as I didn't want to just interrupt it, but then Flirty starts talking about how it's just the two of them at the table and they just need to wait for two more members so they can have a party of four. At that point I had my character butt in and say \"Uh, I'm right here.\" to which Flirty had his character look at him, blink, and then say \"Oh. I never noticed you.\"\n\nI was annoyed by this, if only for the fact that it would have been impossible to miss my character. Not only did Flirty walk up to the table while facing my character, but he also sat down right next to him. And given that Flirty was a finely dressed man sitting across from a finely dressed woman, there is no possible way he wouldn't have noticed a 6'8\" muscular Half-Orc dressed in ragged clothing with scraps of armor here and there. Especially since his character wasn't supposed to be a slow witted or unobservant character. He even wrote about how he \"took in every detail of the tavern.\" So how could he have missed the Half-Orc that dwarfs him?\n\nAs soon as Flirty took notice of my character, he looked him up and down and then turned back to the Moon Elf who began telling him more about the mission that the parties were going on; as soon as this happens, Flirty begins making his character flirt with her in a somewhat subtle manner and then writes that his character had \"already forgotten about the Half-Orc at the table.\"\n\nThe two hold conversation until some scantily clad rogue walks in and joins everyone at the table. They all begin chatting and completely ignore my character for the remainder of my time there. I just decided to leave the roleplay after that, as all of the other parties were full and heading out, and I wasn't going to waste my time trying to play with a group where I clearly wasn't wanted.\n   \n   \nWhelp, that's all. Hope you enjoyed.\n   \n   \n**TL;DR**\n\n**#1 I have a completely normal sword but it's also a special color!**\n\n**#2 Balance? Pfft, what's that? Let me zip around at mach 50 and cause earthquakes with my fists!**\n\n**#3 I don't like how you run this roleplay or the system you've implemented. I demand you cater to my whims!\"**\n\n**#4 Eww, a Half-Orc, let's all just ignore him until he leaves!**",

            "selftext": "The Premise: A story about an entire city being brought back in time by a guy who takes the whole \"born in the wrong generation\" thing waaaay too seriously. The heroes are going to be operating from the shadows to try and overthrow him. I'd tried this concept once before with knights, but that forum was deleted abruptly. When I created my own, I decided to give it another try. \n\nMistake #1: To make it more appealing to the players, I set it in medieval Japan.\n\nMistake #2: I assumed that everyone would work in a relatively realistic setting, using traditional mythology, era-appropriate stuff, etc. Emphasis on assumed; I outlined the plot but didn't give much detail otherwise.\n\nMistake #3: I decided to keep the main villain mysterious. This ended up meaning that other characters working for the villain kept introducing stuff that didn't fit, like giving him a daughter (one of his motivations was the loss of his family) or giving his underlings random powers (he's veeery into traditional Japanese mythology and super isolationist). This one I was able to correct eventually with a character profile, but it caused a lot of chaos before then.\n\nTo be fair, I was completely correct about the setting choice. Players flocked to the story, anime tropes at the ready. The first serious conflict came from a character who was half-demon. Her powers put her on a higher tier of combat ability than anyone but the main villains, and so when the plot came into motion and the villain identified himself, the half-demon rushed off to confront him. And I mean that in a single sentence she slaughtered her way through his guard and addressed him face-to-face.\n\nWe had words. She agreed to dial it down, and take out the powers she'd just assumed all half-demons had. She still had the OC's demon dad brush through the foot soldiers to rescue her, and later on she threw in a hot springs scene just because.\n\nNow to introduce the rest of the cast. There were three other teenagers, a blacksmith, and a grandpa who was consistently adorable. He ended up taking on the role of the only sane man, being more horrified than impressed by the characters' edginess. He also ended up being carried out of the fight against his player's will more often than not. That was a major issue with this fight; we constantly got sidetracked trying to figure out whether or not someone was autohitting or refusing to take any damage. Some people started feeling left out, some for good reasons, some because they were just really bad at initiating conversations and nobody was helping.\n\nThe blacksmith was his own mess. He was supposed to show up later in the story, but joined right away. I let it slide because hey, he wants to be involved in the story, I can't blame him. But then things got weird. For no apparent reason, he decided that magic was dishonorable and started criticizing the heroes, giving unsolicited advice and trying to act wise. He was promptly ignored.\n\nA subplot developed with one of the teenagers when her player suggested she be a villain first, then join the team afterwards. I thought that sounded cool, so I had the bad guy invite her to his place and start explaining his side of things, and to all appearances she joined of her own free will. Then when she got into a fight with the heroes and heard their POV, she started having one of those dramatic \"fighting-the-mind-control\" scenes with what appeared to be a demon. The player claimed it was Japanese, despite it being named after and acting much more like a standard European demon.\n\nThis was pretty much the final straw for me. The game wasn't fun anymore, so I asked everyone if they would be okay with me closing it. They were pretty understanding, and thus I ended that mess of a game.\n\nTL:DR; Never assume people will just know what you want from a story.",
