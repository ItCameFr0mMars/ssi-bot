            "selftext": "This is just a collection of not-so-terrible-but-still-kinda-annoying things I have encountered when I was Rping.  None of them seem to really deserve their own post.  So here they are!\n\n\n**The Japanese Dunmer**\n\nThis fellow was playing a Dunmer (dark elf) character whose name was quite obviously Japanese.  I decided not to call him out on this because it seemed like a small nitpick -- Dunmer do have some crazy names, after all, and maybe the similarity was just a coincidence.  But then the RP started and he kept refering to his character by his \"last\" name, which in Japanese would be a person's given name...  \n\nBut the thing that made me quit the RP was him describing a naked character putting on chainmail with nothing underneath, even worse because in my previous post I had provided a gambeson for the character to wear.\n\n**Aren't You Cold?**\n\nThis was an RP set in Skyrim.  I was playing a Bosmer outlander, she was playing a local Nord.  My character was hiring hers to protect mine while they investigated some Dwemer ruins.  But the other player's character took issue with my character's clothes, saying they wouldn't be warm enough to survive the horrible cold of the ruins.  (Never mind that temperatures tend to equalize underground or that Dwemer ruins are full of steam machines and lava wells.)  I think my character was wearing leather with a fur lined cloak.  Anyway, her character kept harping on my clothes so finally, to placate her, I RPed going to a clothier and buying a coat before the journey.\n\nIt was so boring.  I wanted to hurry up and get to the combat!  This didn't pan out though, because on the way to the ruin I described terrible screaming in the nearby hills.  My character said \"it sounds like hagravans are assaulting someone!\" and her character said \"Nah, it's probably nothing\" and kept walking.  https://i.imgur.com/4lNr049.png\n\n**The Parrot**\n\nThis was one of my first RP partners ever, so my ignorance is largely to blame for the failure of the RP.  This guy wouldn't even get past my screening process now, but I was fresh and naive.\n\nHe was a good writer.  All the ingredients for a cool story were there, but I couldn't figure out why the story was so flat and boring.  Then I realized that this guy never added new information to the RP.  He always repeated what I said back to me.  If I described something, his character would notice it and describe it again in his own words, or he would have an inner monologue explaining how he felt about those things.  He never took control of an NPC or made a decision or did ANYTHING.  I decided to test my theory and started making posts that had no actual story content, just descriptions, to see if he would pick up the slack and make something happen.\n\nNope... Nothing continued to happen.  I ended up quitting really quickly after that.  His character was also a surly cunt with no redeeming qualities so I wasn't too broken up about it.",

            "selftext": "So this is my first story here, I have many more up my sleeve though, but right now, I'll be delving into a combination of both bad character and bad roleplayer. \n\nIt starts off by myself advertising a roleplay with a basic plot, but I do say, as I always mention, that I'm happy to discuss elements of other little things here and there. I already have a premise and plenty of setup for my character as time goes on, because I did this RP with someone who is far better at roleplaying and my character flourished all the more from that. The story was that my character was an seven hundred year old fox spirit (the roleplay took place in Japan), and also the student council president at a school in Tokyo and it would be mostly up to the other roleplayer in the equation to sort of set up how they would meet (meeting with the student council, visiting her shrine, etc.) and I would mostly decide how my character might end up revealing themselves, accidentally or purposely, to their character.\n\nSo, one of the roleplayers I did this with was perfect, everything I could've asked for, their character was fleshed out, had a few ideas for little side plots that could be sorted out alongside everything else and the chemistry with my character really clicked. \n\nBut then came the bad roleplayer. We'll call her C. C also comments on my post and the issue is when you're gathering people, you can't tell how they roleplay from just a single little \"May I join?\" or \"I'd like to do this with you.\" so I agree. My first little alarm bell is that C wants her character (I'll refer to her character as E), to have special powers. Initially, I didn't want this at all, but I figured that there probably wasn't that much harm (WRONG), in letting E have abilities.\n\nBut, just my luck, it turns out that E, of course, has an abusive family and has issues controlling her powers, resulting in her having little outbursts when she's experiencing sadness, anger, etc. (This premise has been done to death, which is a huge shame because honestly, I think it has such a good potential for a character, but it's wasted on edgy teens who think that a decent enough balance for having huge power is not being able to control said power).\n\nBut I shrug and go along with it. After all, my other partner, the actual good one, also has a bit of an abusive family, as her mother is dead and her father crashed emotionally and not every character that has elements of abuse in their backstory is a bad one. We're doing short, snappy replies, but I have no problem with that, seeing as it helps me feel relaxed and sending quickfire replies is just a nice way to advance the plot sometimes.\n\nEventually, I have to start forcing any kind of plot development, such as my character visiting E's home and being let inside, only for my character to hide underneath the bed in fox form and witness E being, well, abused, so mine pops out and tries to stop it and she does. But to me, it all just ends up feeling forced, as E is being generally pitiful about everything. The roleplay is no longer about the mysterious student council president as it were and about how one might have gone about getting her attention or finding out more about her than you bargained for.\n\nAt this point, I just sort of give up. I stop replying because hey, I get that it's kind of a dick move, but sometimes, when you get fed up with things, you just kind of don't want to waste any more time. But that isn't where it ends, oh no.\n\nC starts spamming me with OOC messages trying to guilt me back into responding. I largely ignore them again, hoping she gets my silent message of hey, please leave me alone. Again, dick move, but I'm sort of in the habit of it now. The last message C sends before I block her is her saying that she \"needed someone she trusted to talk to,\" despite the fact she knows next to nothing about me in real life and our only interaction was from our roleplay.",
