            "selftext": "Perhaps one of the most important unwritten rules of forum rp is that nobody is the main character; everyone can have an equal part to play, and if you reduce the other people to basically being your character's supporting cast, it's not fun for anyone.  But that still doesn't stop people from trying to be the very best.\n\nThis story takes place on a freeform digimon roleplay forum.  For those not familiar with the franchise, **completely normal humans** (bolded because this is important) get paired with a digital monster, a creature from a digital world who can achieve various stages of power, and have adventures in both the real and the digital world.  The most common stage - and the one the players were all in during this story - is rookie, which tend to be **stronger, faster, and tougher than humans** (this is also important).\n\nThis site allowed members to run missions, where they could create and run an event for a set number of players where they had an objective to meet, and they'd be rewarded with currency and points towards obtaining their next form - with the person who ran the mission getting a fraction of the reward.  So I decide to set one up for 3 players who are at rookie power; 3 evil digimon kidnapped an innocent food-based digimon's sister, and is demanding a ransom for her.  The players are hired to oversee the deal and make sure no funny business happens.\n\nNaturally, funny business would happen, or else this would be a very boring mission.\n\nThe limited spaces are filled fairly quickly by the following characters:\n\n* **CD**:  Chill Dude.  A fairly chill guy (IC and OOC) around 17-18 years old who was a bit of a gambler.  His partner was a magic-using imp.\n* **LW**:  Literally Who.  I actually don't remember much about this character, save for the fact it was a mid-teens girl.  I don't even remember what her partner was.\n* **MC**:  Main Character, the star of this story.  A mid-20's botanist that had traveled the digital world for a decade (purely in his backstory - not a single bit of those 10 years was played out), who wielded a spear.  His partner was a winged dragon that could spit fire.\n\nSo the group arrives at the site of a deal: a maze-like cave where the 3 evil digimon had their base.  My plan was that they'd be lead them into a trap, battle ensues, they win, everyone's happy.  Fairly basic, but this was low-level stuff.\n\nSo of course, MC can immediately tell that they're being lead into a trap, so he tries his hardest to ruin it: excessively questioning the hostage-takers about where they're going and copious internal monologue about how he knows this is a trap.  I decide to throw him a bone and have one of the more dim digimon offhandedly mention that they shouldn't go down a certain route because someone is down there.\n\nSo how does MC respond?  His digimon immediately makes an impassible firewall that blocks everyone (including CD and LW) and instantly flies through this dark, winding passage at mach 1 to what he suspects is the hostage.  All in a single post.\n\nI let this fly because I was still new to roleplaying around this time, but I don't let him get away with it: it wasn't the hostage that he found at the end of the passage, but a massive chained-up lobster a level higher than he was - something that would require at least all 3 of the mission-takers to fight, if they were going to fight it at all.  He, of course, immediately starts attacking it, which agitates it enough to start fighting back.\n\nAt this point, he lets the firewall disappear, which allows everyone else to catch up to him and the now-raging lobster.  Naturally, everything starts to break down everyone starts to panic - save for MC.  He stays cool, calm, and collected as he pulls out some capsaicin leaves that he just happened to be carrying around, tearing them up, then throwing them to the top of the cavern so they'd rain down on the massive lobster digimon - which he made sure to emphasize would burn him because he was a lobster.  All this time, his digimon is easily evading all its attacks and firing at it with impunity.\n\nI actually called him out on this, but he said it was ok because his character was a botanist.  Nobody else seemed to care, so I drop it there and continue on.\n\nAt this point, the 3 hostage-takers decide this is more trouble than it's worth and decide to just kill everyone.  Each one goes after a different person, so they all have something to do - I even plan to have the food digimon support MC while his digimon distracts the massive lobster so he doesn't get absolutely wrecked.  Except he tells the digimon to go help the others because *he's got this* and starts fighting all on his own with his spear.\n\nAnd he does, in fact, have this, because just like his partner, he's untouchable.  While CD and LW (and their respective partners) are actually struggling and putting up good fights, MC's an expert spear-user and sees through any tricks his opponent attempts.  At one point, his opponent is about to slash him with one of his claws - which would easily tear through human flesh - and he responds by catching the claw *with his hand*.  \n\nBut it doesn't even make him bleed, because he has callouses.  Because he's a botanist.  \n\nWith this position, he slays his opponent, and moves on to helping CD with his.  Meanwhile, the giant lobster has broken free of its chains and retreated into a nearby pool of water - the kind of environment it's even stronger in.  So of course, MC's little dragon is still able to attack it without being harmed, even pulling off divebombs and getting away before the lobster can retaliate.\n\nBack to the fight, CD's opponent starts getting desperate and spews out a poison gas that'll paralyze anyone it comes into contact with.  Of course, MC comes to the rescue by spinning his spear so quickly that it blows away the poison gas.  He even tries to say it blows right back at the user so he'll be paralyzed instead, though I hand-wave that he's immune to his own gas.\n\nRight after this, LW's opponent burrows underground, tunneling over so it could sneak-attack her.  So of course, in the fight against CD's opponent, MC gets knocked down with his spear \"conveniently landing in the path of the underground [LW's opponent]\".\n\nThat's a (near-)exact quote.\n\nShortly after, I let the other two hostage-takers get killed.  MC's dragon is *still* fighting the lobster, and still refuses to even let splashing water touch him.  Realizing this fight won't go anywhere I decide to just have the lobster find a passage underwater and escape through there - a plot hole that nobody calls me out on.  They soon find the hostage, a touching reunion is had, and everyone gets their reward for a mission well done.  MC, of course, makes sure he's the last one to post, to get the last word in.",

            "selftext": "Fairly long and rant-y....\n\n\nOkay, so I have been an RPer for over a decade. I search the Roleplay sub for anything interesting because I'm the type who loves writing *so much* that I enjoy having a ton of RP happening at once. I can type somewhere around 180wpm and read and retain information quickly. That being said, I do not scrimp details in RP. If I think it's important that you know the color of that bead on my dress, I say it. I reply or start with something to drive the plot because that's *how it works!*\n\n\nThat being said, I post my advert for RP when I'm ready, willing and able to take on more, or when RP partners are slower or busier (which is never a problem for me) I'm clear in what I say. I often mention that one-liners aren't going to fly, nor are people who just want smut or won't drive anything forward.\n\n\nI have been deceived a time or few. \n\n\nRPer A has a glorious advert for himself. Very intriguing and nice. We talk it out. His intro....a one-line along the lines of.... \"A strange man who didn't belong in this forest walked through it anyway.\" Goodbye, good luck.\n\n\nRPer B makes one request while planning. Can I make my character *flirty,* even if it's not how she usually is? Okay, I'll bite. I shouldn't have. I spend a half hour writing a novella of an intro after they gave me one sentence to write off of and I said it wasn't going to work. They asked me to start then.... Hence the novella. I exchanged this for three incomplete sentences. I try again. Another novella for two sentences and the foreboding asterisks before an action..... The action is to look my already annoyed character up and down. *I can't do this.* Goodbye, good luck.\n\n\nRPer C seemed promising, too, until he pulled a \"I only messaged you on Hangouts to try to convince you to join Discord.\" It doesn't run on my laptop, I'm not trying, and I specified email only in my own advert. Then, I realized he wanted to be elitist and demand rapidfire responses from me *constantly,* even If I told him I was sick and needed a break. This was also just in OOC discussion before RP! He kept on irritating me until I finally gave him the \"real life before RP\" speech that is kind of an unspoken *rule,* to which he replies he understands. He didn't understand. He kept whining. Goodbye. Good luck.\n\n\nI just seem to find some of the *best* of the *worst* examples of roleplayers when searching. If all you do is one-line or quickfire smut, put it in your advert. Just be honest and stop trying to bait someone into your weird little area. It's gross!",

            "selftext": "Another post here just reminded me of this story, which took place on Second Life.  For those of you who are unfamiliar it's a virtual world where you can do literally anything you want to do.  Roleplay is fairly popular there.\n\nSome guy was advertising that he was putting together a DnD game on SL, and I had always been fascinated with DnD but had no friends to play with irl so I got my bf (now ex) to go with me.  The guy running the thing was also the DM.  My ex was a scripter and because I was so excited about playing, he built a scripted DnD table that could handle dice rolls and pawn movements, because the DM had literally nothing except a free dice roll HUD.  I made the pawns.  You could spawn them on the table by clicking it and then use a HUD to move them around the board.  It was pretty neat.\n\nWe explained to the DM that we didn't know how to play, and he said that was fine, beginners are welcome.  But instead of actually going over rules with us he jumped straight into a session.\n\nI was consulting a pdf of the rulebook as I played which obviously slowed things up, and when it was my turn I would ask questions about what I was supposed to do.  Most of the other players were very experienced and were losing patience with me.  One ended up berating me, saying \"I understand that you're new but this is getting ridiculous.\"\n\nI asked the DM if we could set aside a time outside of the normal session where he could teach me the game so I wouldn't be slowing down the game and he readily agreed.  He gave me a day and a time.  I said I can't do that, I have to work those hours.  This devolved into a huge debate involving everyone (people were offering suggestions such as switching the time for the regular session and the training session and things like that) but in the end he finally settled on his original time, the time when I was at work.  \n\nWhatever.  I thought maybe I'd pick up enough from reading the rulebooks and from just playing the game that I'd soon be up to speed.  I wasn't really enjoying the game that much though, because the people in the group argued about every. possible. thing.  Do we go left or right in this tunnel?  Do we bury the corpses of these dudes we just killed or leave them here?  Do we rescue this girl or not?  There was a huge, drawn out debate over every single decision that had to be made, and then there was a debate about how to cut down the debating and expedite the decision making process.\n\nThen my ex sent me a screenshot of one of the other players in the group aggressively hitting on him in PM.  At this point I'd had enough of everyone's rudeness and stupidity so I quit on the spot.  \n\nTo my delight, my ex deleted the scripted table and didn't give a copy to anyone else so they got to enjoy playing DnD with no pawns.",
