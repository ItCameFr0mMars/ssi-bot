We had a really good plot going on at first in the beginning, I know normally you plan where things might go just to have a good idea what was going on. I was really, really invested in the plot, too. However,  what would start happening more frequently was he would interrupt in the middle of the scene, maybe ask a question, I would answer hoping that we could continue, however we couldn't go back to continuing.\n\nI spent about a few months with Fedora hopefully we could finally get somewhere, but he just kept planning and planning way too far ahead. I just wanted to rp the scene we were working on, it was as if Fedora didn't even appreciate what was going on in the present. \n\nFedora was a big fan of te ASOIAF series, and other things with complicated things that tied in. I think Fedora was trying to build something clever, and deep, however  it just was really irritating. For me RPing is about having fun, I don't care how clever it is. As long as things are reasonable in the context of the story, and the writing is good, I'm fine. \n\nI hate it when I have RP partners that take things so seriously and try to make masterpieces. In the end, the months  I spent with Fedora was 3/4ths planning and 1/4 rping. It was a real shame, I really liked the plot.",

            "selftext": "Hey, /r/BadRPerStories! This is my first time posting in basically any subreddit, but bare with me because this is a long and bumpy ride. \n\nSo, first things first. This took place in a roleplaying based page only a couple of weeks ago, though from experience and mouth-to-mouth talk, recipts and stories I've come to realize the community I currently strive my creativity from is a *circlejerk*. To avoid any trouble let's call this congregation a **clique** and their respective members are *A*, *H*, *W*, *K*, *J* and the biggest and most formidable bad roleplayer of them all: *R*. Now, to be frank with you, my dear readers, these people don't like talent, their wording is unique and quite advanced, fluid and pullid, though it's really a huge discomfort to see such talented individuals waste that potential with scandals and *drama*.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's start. \n\nIt had been almost a year since I came back from a hiatus, just a couple of months back due to these people pushing the limit. Let's start with *R*. Well, R has some problems outside of the web, to which degree I'm uncertain, but more than often he lets his popularity, bad advices from his \"friends\" and the pressure of real life get to him, so... R opens his mouth at uncalled for times, not to mention he's a godmodder from what I've been told and seen thanks to acquaintances and close friends on the website. One of my friends (who doesn't roleplay anymore) participated in a group storyline which R later crashed in. Everything ran smoothly until all of the sudden? R decided to pull a cosmic and convoluted mumbo-jumbo tactic out of his ass to \"win\" the battle, this after someone had attacked his character and brutally wounded him. **PLEASE NOTE** that, the idea and concept he was using had not previously been mentioned, add to this that it was also banned from the storyline as stated by the mod himself. His defense? *It was a feat* when it wasn't, he wrongfully used a completely out of context scan to \"prove\" this. Thanks to this, the storyline crumbled down. To quote my friend here: *He got wind of my and others criticisms and got butthurt but kept going in the story.*\n\nNext thing I know, another great friend of mine who we'll call *D*, so D is a superb person, extremely agile and skilled writer, creative mind and outright a nice individual outside the virtual world. D takes a lot of joy and pride in the hard-word he emphasizes when writing, naturally he enjoys promoting this writing. So this happened two or so months after I went on hiatus (to clarify, D and me hadn't interacted by that point.) D posted his writing on groups, public view, ect... And *R* being the gentle and polite person he is, got bothered by this humble act, saying that *this page shouldn't be just for writing* and that *you didn't need to be obnoxious to get noticed.* (...See the double standard here?) Additionally, a clusterfuck of users joined him in that short-lived crusade, which ultimately shot D's mood down.\n\nNow, you might be asking *He has a point, roleplaying pages should be designed to do precisely that: create, but people have a right to upload other content too, if they might desire.* And my dear reader, I heartwarmingly agree with the notion, the problem here is? R and the Crew are double-faced individuals. This next story proves that:\n\nThis picks up after the spawn of time I mentioned, a couple of weeks back, and it again involves a close friend of mine, we'll name him *N*, seems good? Well, N much like D has a reputation for lifting your mood up, whether it'll be in private messages or publicly, and... Because that community feeds from drama, guess what R and Co did? Yep, complain and start the topic they claim to avoid. To make things short, R insulted N, followed by a waterfall of replies basically encouraging the nasty behaviour (*H*, *W* &amp; *J* followed through.) So, what I did? Well, not pour more inside the boiling water for sure, I did what anyone else would: Delete them all.\n\nThey didn't like this and, called me out for *deleting them without a debatable good reason.* When *A* the gang's leader always tells us to *ditch off the rotten apples*. I guess this advice and life lesson does not apply to their crew.\n\nDuring the turmnoil, J said she had encouraged R's behaviour (this all taking place in a status N made to apologize, which he shouldn't have) because J **loathes** non-related roleplay behaviour. Now take in mind that while she's in all her right to express this, she's also a big participant, J is known to be very self-deprecating without the gloomy humor, and more than often acts hysterical and paranoid with the community, thinking we all hate who she is behind the screen and role for no reason, even to the point of calling out other users because they refuse to put up with said conduct, and this isn't new some other users have told me she's been dragging on this for too long. So in less words, she's an hypocrite too.\n\nNext is, *W*. W has a pairing through one of his multiple accounts, who is none other than *K*. This \"beef\" (if you wanna see it that way...) was silent and took place incredibly, 3 days ago. K and my character are close, canon-wise, so when I made my character K immediately launched and offered to be my connection, which I accepted (I had no idea how she acted at all, so yes it's indeed my fault for forcing out a connection). So after I deleted all the *rotten apples* (this not including W's alternative profile) K started ghosting on me, she'll avoid comments, messages or any form of interaction but since she's not really active (even though she claims otherwise) I didn't think much about it, until well W blocked me in all his accounts, K deleted and dropped off the connection. Come another good friend, we'll name her *LL*. LL informed me that soon after K paired with W, fame got to her head and practically thinks she never does wrong whatsoever, feels threatened when a mirror appears and outright avoids writing or producing any sort of content at all and that her good girl masquerade well, it's just that, simple and plain.\n\nAnd, if you think this is bad? Allow me to make it worse yet:\n\nThis \"group\" is widely known amongst our community for preaching double standards and hypocrisy (if this isn't evident by now). **A** for example, always claims to do good, influence others in their writing, yet ooc it's known that he orchestrates the debauchery that later takes place on-screen, he went as far as to make his \"friends\" chase off a handful of other roleplayers from the verse because they refused to do their deeds, claiming such bullshit as *they intended to separate us* or that they were simply *not good enough to hang with them*, still he's often puffing off that fake heroic chest of his, saying how others should follow his example, when the guy hasn't written anything in forever and has the audacity to call others for *doing a post and wanting 5 minutes of fame*. \n\nAnother funny anecdote is, he backed off a fight against another roleplayer when he was about to lose, and not content with this? HE DELETED HIS POSTS. \n\nIt doesn't end here, as one of their lesser known but equally nefarious members who we'll call *EB* for simplicity's sake has gone as far as to make broad &amp; fake statements about people *raping her character*, when she agreed to be involved in the first place. She's also catfished the same friend who battled R, and a handful of others through the years. Alas, whenever a mirror pops up, she claims to be *the only one capable of doing the character true justice* saying *others don't quite get the grip as much as her and therefore are lesser and horrible writers.* As you gussed, she hasn't done anything at all in recent years (LL being one of those affected). \n\nH has also being known for going as far as to racially attack members through private messages, whenever he is bothered by minimal crap going on, or the incredibly natural outcome of a roleplaying battle. Hate profiles spawn once in a while, attacking a rather polarized and controversial member, which sure she's participates in similar schemes, but at least confronts the issue. I can only wonder if said individual behind the profile is H or any of his acolytes.\n\nLikewise, the fact most of their \"members\" steal content from others and I mean *LITERALLY* rip-off others ideas and posts doesn't help their case. People (including me) have tried to reach out, tell them to tame their bullcrap and get off that high-horse but it does little to nothing at all. Groups are ransacked by them often, almost as if to keep an eye on every creative process users make, because their disablement to conclude a 1-on-1 or group storyline blinds them from enjoying other people's content (yes, they've shaded users for this matter as well).\n\nI'm sure I left some details out, but keeping up with everything they make is complicated, honestly too? I've been feeling rather unwelcoming just to make my profile drama free after this incident took place, I know, roleplay is only a hobby it shouldn't trespass limits and affect my life, it happens, however. Either way, thanks for listening! Ergh, reading.",
