            "selftext": "So there's this one guy on a site I go to - let's call him *Bruce*, for reasons that will soon become apparent. Bruce and I play together on an urban fantasy site, and he plays this one character who's a wizard...\n\nOkay, let's just call his character *Batman*. Because that's who his character is. Batman, with some Kirito and Kiritsugu Emiya thrown in. He's notable for wanting to destroy [country that will remain unnamed] *single-handedly*, and even gave himself the cool nickname \"The Terror of [country]\" for good measure. So far, he's murdered the heads of state of said country and is zeroing in on their child (the princess, played by another RPer). Why he wants to destroy this country is a complete mystery to everyone except himself.\n\nThing is, using magic on such a scale always invites serious, damaging magical consequences. How many of those has he run into? *Zero.* For starters, a much more powerful wizard than him has set up magical detection fields *precisely* to stop incidents like that, and he somehow got away with evading her detection. Why? *Because he's Batman, fuckers.*\n\nIronically, Bruce is quick to cry godmodding when other people do things he doesn't like. When another RPer (a mod, no less) tried plotting out with him and raised the possibility of defeating him, he was quick to cry \"godmodding\" and threatened to bring in the mods. The whole incident just made me go :|.\n\nAlso, he believes that bisexuals are bisexual because all of them were molested as children.",

            "selftext": "I'll be posting some of his other solos in this thread later, but this is a guy on a **Dragonball Z** site that I mod, whose been doing solos by himself. According to another mod, he has a habit of completely ignoring site lore, to the point where on another dbz site, he had used a mechanic that didn't even exist there, just to escape a Risk of Death thread that he had entered in the first place. As you can see, his solos come off like some fanfic, with way too much exposition, and paints him as some kind of savior. Dude's the type to ask about learning Instant Transmission and training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, which are the two things you need to always earn and have an established presence for, on any Dbz site. All the demons in his solos, are also the [knights](https://i.imgur.com/PAAB4Lb.jpg) from Dark Souls, as this apparently has a huge obsession/fetish for them. He's already been warned on site for trying to save Namek by himself, despite it already being established that it's protected, so now he's been taking all of his \"I'm the savior\" bullshit on small planets that aren't even canon to the site.\n\n&gt;Time had passed for the greater good, ___ was still on the planet and pushed away the Elite Organization army along with killing ___ in the process. ____ was at an all time high when it came to his strength growing. ____ was at the biggest city that Planet Terror had to offer. He was personally invited by the Mayor himself along with the president of the planet being there. He entered the office of the Mayor and seeing both the Mayor and the president standing side by side. He took a graceful kneel and bowed his head at both of them.\n\n&gt;\"I am honored that you have invited me...\"\n\n&gt;The Mayor spoke up with his white mustache covering his lips.\n\n&gt;\"No need to kneel before us ____. You truly saved our planet from destruction and for that you are welcomed to live in this city with free housing, food and water.\"\n\n&gt;The president then also lifting up his finger and adding to that statement.\n\n&gt;\"Yes and also we will have a grand feast honoring your name later tonight.\"\n\nDbz is known for their aliens, so I don't understand why he believes an alien planet would even have a mayor of all things. Or how they'd even hear of his tales on some different small planet. It's terribly out of place, just like past members we've had, who had a kink for writing possession, split personalities, or bipolar disorder.",
