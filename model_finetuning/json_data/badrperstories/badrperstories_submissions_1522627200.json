In writing this I realized some of these might be more than Tinybad, but I can't edit the title, and ultimately none of them caused lasting problems, so they still qualify.\n\n**I'm Adowable!**\n\nThe very second RP I ever joined, and the first I actually got to enjoy, was pretty dark. Angst, characters getting captured and tortured, that sort of thing. Then a new, enthusiastic guy shows up, wanting to join. There are only three regulars, myself included, so we welcome him. I do know for a fact he was a guy despite what came next.\n\nHe submitted a twelve-year-old catboy superhero named Prince Kitty. Said superhero had a pink and white color scheme, a compact mirror as the source of his powers, and giant robots based on a kitten and a strawberry. The strawberry could talk and was named Strudel. Despite his cutesy tendencies, he ultimately turned out to be a decent roleplayer. After he learned to dial down Prince Kitty's tsundere protector, anyway.\n\n**Do as I say, not as I do...**\n\nOver in the forum that hosted Captain Emo, my Alpha Chadette and the trainwreck samurai game, one particular player had taken the role of Game Master and was approving characters for her game. Someone mentioned they were interested, and she let them know that \"I'm honestly cool with anyone you can create. Just no psychopaths or sociopaths.\" This from the person whose characters are, at best, jaded and cold, and at worst are actual sadistic killers. I have no idea what prompted her to say this.\n\n**Ding-dong kiss**\n\nThe setting was a werewolf forum. My character was an asexual doctor. I'd decided that for this game I didn't really want to mess with the inevitable dominant male alpha thing, and I was starting to think that I might actually be ace myself at that time, so I wanted to try something different.\n\nAlmost as soon as I began posting, another player decided to get involved. Let's call his character Bishish, because I think he was going for an anime pretty boy thing but it never really worked. Now, in his very first post, Bishish decided that they were old friends. Okay, it'd be nice if we got to play this instead of you telling me, but whatever. Then he revealed that he'd had a crush on Doc since realizing he was bi. Now I have to deal with an unrequited romance that is also being forced into the backstory. Greeaaaat.\n\nDoc stayed friendly but a little uncomfortable, and focused on his current mission: a house call on the alpha male's pregnant, human wife. This was a high-risk pregnancy so everyone was pretty tense. Except for Bishish. He and a number of other members of the pack were chilling at the alpha's house, and when Doc knocked on the door, Bishish opened it and greeted him with a kiss full on the lips. I had no idea how to respond, so Doc just sort of slid around the guy and went to work. Everyone else likewise ignored the move, so Bishish just slunk over to the couch.\n\nSomehow this did not clue in Bishish's player that his advances were unwanted, because a few scenes later he wrote a one-line post saying that our characters were watching a movie and eating together. Thanks. Do you not know what asexual means? As a matter of fact, do you know what godmodding means? I was able to alter the scene into a diner meeting, and just had Doc get uncomfortable and leave, making it very clear in his thoughts that he wasn't interested. The forum died before I got the chance to find out if Bishish took the hint.\n\n**A heavy conscience**\n\nOne of the websites I use the most is fairly small, so you tend to run into the same people over and over in different groups, and invite them to yours to help fill things out. One such person was...let's call him Phil. Phil seemed interested in a longstanding fantasy RP I was in, and he checked things out. Then, some time later, he contacted me about this one character I had.\n\nThis person was a member of a secret society who was investigating the local subplot, a series of mysterious attacks in the city. In order to do so she'd taken on the identity of a prostitute. I hadn't been able to get a good feel for the character, so I'd let her become one of the monster's victims and hadn't really thought about her for a few months at the point Phil asked me. Thus his vague comments about it being \"such a shame\" threw me off. Eventually he confronted me, informing me that this might ruin our friendship, but his conscience was bothering him too much to stay silent. He didn't approve of me playing a prostitute. He didn't approve of anyone playing a prostitute, in fact. I mentioned this to a mutual friend, and found out that Phil had in fact done the exact same thing to a different group whose story included a brothel.\n\nPhil considered everything related to sex work a vile, traumatizing and degrading thing, and even putting a fictional character through that experience was, in his words, evil. I was baffled and amused, tried to argue with him a little, but ultimately we couldn't come to an agreement and decided to let it be, since it was a moot point anyway. I do admit I was tempted to create a sex worker in one of our shared games, but I've learned that kind of thing usually doesn't create someone I actually want to play.",
