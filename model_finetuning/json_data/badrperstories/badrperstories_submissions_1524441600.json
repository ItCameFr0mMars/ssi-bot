            "selftext": "I had an RP where things were getting relatively dramatic, the final battle was brewing up, the entire group just got stabbed in the back by our leader, and one of our crew members was a day away from being executed. We needed to end this rival faction NOW. Character A and my character, Wallflower (The most badass name for a Bounty Hunter) first met at rivals, but now they're brothers-in-arms after all the shit they've been through (After you've ended a war between two planets through a dance-off, you know you're pretty tight).\n\nOOC, A was having some drama with another person, they got into an argument and got a bit pissy when I said he was being a dickish. So, our characters all agree to a plan to get onto this space station, get our friend back, piss on the Captain's corpse and ride back home on a Golden Banana. A and me take to the infiltration route, sneaking into the enemy's ranks, getting uniforms and all so we could get access to a ship and take off undetected, allowing the others a ride in.\n\nWe're successful in getting a ride, but me and A have to stay behind to stall for time and get the others out safely. Wallflower makes some wise-cracks about stormtrooper aim, while A starts godmode kill stealing (You know, like 'Oh, you didn't actually kill that person, they were still alive and were totally about to kill you, but I saved you!') and criticizes my character for being slow. Not much yet, so I moved with a shrug.\n\nWe now have to get up ourselves, we get separated. A bags another ship and goes to fly to the station, Wallflower has a brutal fist fight with an especially annoying NPC rival that's been a pain in my ass, being a pretty good fight and ending with Wallflower letting the guy live and booking it out, hiding on a second ship, but this one has guys in it. \n\nNot much of a complication, Wallflower just has to keep his head down and hold on tight (Because this universe had some choice physics), get on the station and slink off into the ventilation system as planned to meet up with the others. Noticing this, A decides that the best thing to do is to loudly announce to the enemy that Wallflower is a pretender, then proceeds to fire at the ship Wallflower is hiding on. Simply saying \"Sorry, Brother; but I have to maintain my cover\"\n\nLater, it is made clear by him that he was killing my character SPECIFICALLY because I didn't side with him.",

While this isn't bad in a behavioral or conduct sense, it's......still quite unique.]\n-\nASUKA:\nshe decided to tell him even though she was scared she sighed \"my mom........died of cancer and my dad....killed himself r-right in front of me......\" she said softly letting a tear drop go down her cheek \"a-and i had no other relatives to take care of me so, i was sent to a orphanage.......a couple of days went by until i was they took me to go see the lady in charge there was a guy named Mikey there......and he adopted me.......me and him were friends till i became a teen.....he started acting weird....and then he started abusing me...\" she told him and then started crying she left out one thing\n-\nHAIMON:\nHaimon nodded, \"Is that all? If so, just let me know where he lives,\" The male peeked back into the classroom, his eyes turning back to Asuka's, \"If you're telling the truth, I can call the authorities on him and file a restraining order, as for living arrangements...\" He trailed off, thinking about it for a second.\n-\nASUKA:\nwhen he asked if that was all she shook her head and looked at him before looking down and start crying...she knew that Mikey would be mad at her and possibly kill her now that she told someone\n-\nHAIMON:\nHaimon once again placed a hand on her shoulder, pulling her closer, he rested Asuka's head on his shoulder continuing, \"What else is there to say then?\" He could feel her tears leaking through his shirt. 'Hey! What are you doing!? Thus far, anything as impulsive as this has gotten you in a bad place!' He said this to himself, in his mind of course.\n-\nASUKA:\n\"h-he.........he.......\" she cried more \"he....he raped me......and n-now he does every d-day\" she said crying more into his shoulder she was still shaking in fear scared of what might happened next\n-\nHAIMON:\nHaimon's eyes widened he turned without another word, pulling his phone from his pocket he dialed a number putting the phone to his ear. He soon started speaking, \"Task Force Alpha, I need you to find a target... Give me a second,\" He took the phone from his ear, \"Asuka, what's his last name?\"\n-\nASUKA:\n\"M-Mikey........Smith....t-thats his n-name\" she said softly looking at him crying just a little wondering who he was calling and what they were going to do she stopped wondering and looked at Haimon\n-\nHAIMON:\nHaimon nodded, \"Alpha? Yes, a Mikey Smith... Yes... Order: Eliminate\" He hung up, sliding the phone into his pocket, his eyes icy. \"He's being dealt with, Asuka\" Haimon lead her back near the classroom before looking to her, \"Once this is over, do you have anybody to stay with?\"\n-\nASUKA:\n\"I-I don't know\" Asuka said softly \"like i said i have no relatives\" she said softly with a sigh looking at him \"t-thank y-you\" she said softly to him with a slight smile\n-\nHAIMON:\n\"Hm, this is problematic...\" His mind screamed, 'No! Do not do it!' Haimon's voice came again, \"Would you like to...\" He trailed off tossing the thought around, 'You can't handle it, your hormones are going to go crazy!' Haimon hesitated, \"Would you like to stay with me?\" His mind screamed once more, 'Dammit! Are you crazy!?'\n-\nASUKA:\nshe blushed \"uh......sure i guess....as long as your fine with it\" she said softly trying to hide her blushing with her hair \"this is going to be fun....\" she thought shyly\n-",
