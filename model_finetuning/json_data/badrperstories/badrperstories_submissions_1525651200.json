Everything was going smoothly. \"Was\"\n\nRight up until Jay decided to spring their friend on me. Their friend who within 5 minutes I found to be really, annoying. I almost can't sum up how irritating this other person was. I tried to be a trooper, but button, after button was being pushed. \n\nI explained to them that I didn't think we were compatible, and told Jay the same. That the friend they surprised me with, and I were not going to roleplay.\n\nSo Jay's decided it means she, and I won't be roleplaying either. So I lost two partners, all because Jay had to surprise me out of nowhere with a \"friend\" of theirs, and then decided that since I didn't want to RP with their friend, I couldn't with them either.",

            "selftext": "On Pern, one of the big features is dragon hatchings. During these your candidates are presented with the opportunity to \"Impress\" a dragon that will become their lifemate. These dragons are usually written by other people and have their own personalities, thoughts, opinions, etc. Because of this, a lot of time, effort and thought is (or should be) put into the dragons created and the pairings made, since they will become part of the player's roster and the character's life for the rest of said life.\n\nNeedless to say, they're a big damn deal.\n\nNow, this site has had a hatch planned for nearly two years. Everyone knew it was coming. There's been a counter on the site since it was 100+ days out. There was literally no way to be surprised by this big event. Everyone had been making candidates and getting excited for well over 6 months.\n\nEnter Whiny.\n\nWhiny made a character roughly a week before the hatching was scheduled to be started. Bear in mind, that most hatchrunners have their dragons made and paired 2-4 weeks before the scheduled start date. They've spent months looking over candidates and making sure they have the best possible pairings. \n\nAnd it was wonderful.\n\nThe pairings were well thought out, the art was beautiful, the character development was wonderful and 10 pages later, everyone left happy.\n\nExcept Whiny.\n\nWhiny jumped in the public chat and started asking if anyone else was left standing without a single candidate Impression. (Yes, a few others were. Mostly new people or ones that hadn't been around much... Like Whiny.) She complained that she'd made this character specifically for this hatch and hadn't Impressed and whine whine whine.\n\nSo, people pointed out WHY she didn't. Explained, gently, that you generally want to make a character a long time before. And that some of the characters that Impressed had been around for a year or longer, and others had been left standing that had been around longer than that! \n\nWhiny's response? To announce that she would just make another character in the same month as the next hatch. Because doing the same thing twice will surely get the results you want.",
