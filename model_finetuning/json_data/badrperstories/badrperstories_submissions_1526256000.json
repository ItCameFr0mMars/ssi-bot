            "selftext": "I don't know how many of you know about the roleplaying community of Chatango. I'm a member, it's a sad, dying race. Yadda yadda, backstory, here's the background.\n\nEnter me; 17 yo dude bored at my computer a few minutes ago. I decide to log into my female character's account. What a mistake that was. This particular character could be either gender, it doesn't really matter, I only made her female because male zombies are overrated. You heard that right, my character is a rotting mound of flesh in a suit of armor. Nothing \"sexy\" or \"romantic\". This didn't dissuade our protagonist, Mr. Anime neko dude. (Warning, it gets rapey. Click away if that's something touchy for you.)\n\n\nHim (5/14/18 11:30:35 PM): Your armor looks a bit worn, perhaps I can help you clean it a bit?\n\n\nMe (5/14/18 11:31:01 PM): ...\n\n\nHim (5/14/18 11:31:08 PM): Hmm\n\n\nMe (5/14/18 11:31:17 PM): ...\n\n\nHim (5/14/18 11:33:05 PM): -starts cleaning your armor with a \ncloth-\n\n\nMe (5/14/18 11:34:08 PM): ... -Bites your arm without hesitation, attempting to eat as much of it as possible.-\n\n\nHim (5/14/18 11:34:34 PM): Owwie \n\n\nMe (5/14/18 11:35:02 PM): -Continues eating until proven impossible.-\n\n\nHim (5/14/18 11:35:27 PM): Why are you trying to eat me?\n\n\nMe (5/14/18 11:36:01 PM): ... -Continues doing so.-\n\n\nHim (11:38:09 PM): Cut that out~\n\n\nMe (11:38:38 PM): ... -It seems reasoning or conversation was useless.-\n\n\nHim (11:39:20 PM): -pokes your face- \n\n\nMe (11:40:16 PM): ... -Bites the finger.-\n\n\nHim (11:41:33 PM): Owwie \n\n\nMe (11:42:01 PM): ... -Moves in for the neck.-\n\n\nHim (11:42:43 PM): -pushes you away-\n\n\nMe (11:43:06 PM): ... -Lays there on the ground weighed down by the armor.-\n\n\nHim (11:43:49 PM): -crouches over you- play nice \n\nMe (11:44:18 PM): -Instantly attempts to bite again.-\n\n\nHim (11:45:50 PM): -tries taking off your armor-\n\n\nMe (11:46:21 PM): -Now free of the crushing weight of the armor. Gets up, shambles towards you, and attempts to bite.-\n\n\nHim (11:48:08 PM): -once more tries pushing you away-\n\n\nMe (11:48:35 PM): -Gets back up, moves towards, attempts to bite.-\n\n\nHim (11:49:37 PM): Someone certainly likes to bite -looks around for something to stuff in your mouth-\n\n\nMe (11:51:56 PM): -Shambles towards the meal.-\n\n\nHim (11:53:53 PM): -shrugs and kisses your cheek-\n\n\nMe (11:55:03 PM): -Bites the face that was now close enough to bite.-\n\n\nHim (11:55:15 PM): Owwie owwie owwie\n\n\nMe (11:57:36 PM): -Continues doing so until removed. Nothing could stop the feral, emotionless zombie it seemed.-\n\n\nHim (11:58:06 PM): -pushes you away and pouts-\n\n\nMe (11:58:24 PM): ... -Gets back up and continues trying to eat.-\n\n\nHim (11:59:34 PM): -takes off my shirt and stuffs it into your mouth- maybe that will stop the biting\n\n\nMe (12:00:15 AM): -Chews on the shirt. Perfect chance to get away...-\n\n\nHim (12:01:24 AM): -grins and further strips the zombie-\n\n\nMe (12:02:17 AM): -Nothing but an exposed ribcage and some organs. Steady, continuous gnawing on the shirt.-\n\n\nHim (12:05:19 AM): Hmm... how does it carry around all that armor? -strips it's lower half, giggling a bit-\n\n\nMe (12:06:07 AM): -A skeletal pair of legs with some cloth a tattered pair of trousers barely covering the nonexistent, rotted-off poonany.-\n\n\nHim (12:07:49 AM): Hehe well I guess she is pretty cute for a zombie~\n\n\nSo, if we can take anything from this, it's that Chatango should be avoided like the plague. And yes, it's all single line, but if he wasn't going to try either was I.\n",

            "selftext": "This is my first post in this subreddit and first post ever in Reddit. I've read through a lot of the other stories here, and I decided to share mine. This story takes place solely on Discord. A few months after I made an account and joined multiple RPing servers (one being one of my favourite YouTuber's), I got into some RPs. Most of them died off and one was a little to biased for older players. I decided to make my own with some friends I knew in real life. After a while, I started gaining members and they made new RPs with my permissions. It was fun, but I felt out of place in most of them. Enter A, because I'm so good at coming up with names. Anyway, A was hanging around in the YouTuber's server. He posted a short emote in the server's random RPing channel, where anyone could join in whenever and to pretty much anything. We started RPing together and it got to the point where I decided to bring it to my server. We both became DMs since we both started it. The RP became a hit immediately. I had a great time during the weeks the RP flourished. Then, things took a turn for the worse because of A. He was DMing an NPC that was a sympathetic soldier in the evil faction, which actually fit and could be interesting. It also added to the plight of said facrion's troops. He did it very well, at first. Until his character made a stupid decision. The group comes upon a bunch of bodies, and a patrol is fast approaching. My NPC said that the patrol had beasts that could sniff them out and started covering himself in blood. The other PCs followed, except for the NPC that was controlled by A. He tried to carry a child and run to safety. The patrol had horses and beasts that would smell them. His character calls us fools and doesn't get far. The NPC distracts the patrol long enough for the boy to escape, but is captured and flayed to set an example. He is tied to a pole and left at the side of a road. The PCs eventually find him, and one tries to put A's NPC out of his misery. The NPC convinces them to let him die fighting. Right after being flayed and left out for a few hours. Bring the inexperienced DM and guy who wanted no conflict, I let it slide. His character proceeds to hold off an entire patrol unarmoured and bleeding to death and in shock. He also kills \"dozens of orcs\". Heavily armoured orcs. The chat dies for a bit until I move things along. NPC eventually gets killed. Everything is going well until the final battle. Just as everyone is getting into it and an epic duel is about to happen, A uses his DM character (which is an OP god). He nukes the whole world and brings a few characters into his own worlds. The RP died very quickly after that. I decided to bring it back months later through restarting. A makes his DM character narrate resetting the Universe. His character narrates a few times after, all of it poorly done and cringy. It was at this point that I realized how bad he was. Run on sentences, bland characters, inconsistent ones, poor dialog, etc. In the YouTuber's server, he said he would only find happiness in killing a moderator's girlfriend and long time member of the server. He leaves right after. I looked back through his messages, and it turns out he butted into everything. Literally everything. He always has to get a word in. In a channel meant for serious topics, he copies and pastes vaguely relevant quotes from Google and tries to sound deep. He only managed to annoy  everyone. Me, being the idiot that I am, let it slide. His non-DM characters are all inconsistent and keeps using stupid excuses for it. After a while, the original members of the RP rejoin. Enter B. He was great at RPing. He was polite and a very nice guy OOC. Some of his emotes actually made me feel something. We became good friends and we RPed frequently. One day, A uses his DM character to take over a large region. All of the annoyance and anger in me from before erupts. I grill him out in private messages... To be Continued.",
