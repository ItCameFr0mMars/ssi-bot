            "selftext": "Sorry in advance for how long this is, but I very much have the tendency to ramble.\n\nSo I used to run a forum. It was a fairly standard real life-based slice-of-life type of deal set in NYC, which isn't the most exciting thing; but while I typically look more toward fantasy, slice of life is definitely my jam and my friend was starting up this site so I don't mind helping her with it.\n\nIn the areas where I RP, it's pretty common to post requests for characters who have a history with your character to fill in certain roles in their lives, like family members, or old friends, because our characters don't exist in a vacuum and generally if you've lived in a place for a while you're gonna know at least SOME people.\n\nSo I make this character who is a college student. She's a bit of a wide-eyed innocent, pretty naive and a quirky little munchkin. (For example - she tells people she's half-ghost. Now that she's an adult she knows that isn't true, but she was raised by a single mother as the result of a one night stand with a stranger who was just passing through town for one night, so her mom always told her this fantastical story about her dad being a ghost. Even though she grew out of believing that, it's still a fun fact she likes to tell people. She's obsessed with aliens and hauntings and cryptozoology and all the things that go bump in the night, she tells dumb punny jokes and is just generally a silly but sweet sort of person.) She likes to think of herself as a lot more experienced and world weary than she actually is, but in truth she tends to make a lot of dumb decisions. Including trusting all the wrong people. She meets this guy, within a couple months they're engaged... And then he ends up getting killed in front of her, because it turns out he was Big Trouble\u2122 and had been lying to her all along.\n\nSo I request a character to fill a role in her life, since there isn't currently any character on the site who can step into that position. This guy - lets call him Chris - is a professor in the area she studies at the college she attends and also her mentor. They're pretty solid friends, and after all these bad things have happened to her she's obviously very heavily affected by it, wreaking havoc on her performance in school, and Chris steps in to help her deal with her problems, grieve and move past it without letting it ruin her life. There was also a mention of these two potentially ending up in a romantic relationship in the future, but no promises - whatever happens in the course of the story happens, and that's great.\n\nSomeone takes the request. Great! We talk about the two of them a bit and they have some ideas that I'm about wary about but it wouldn't be the first time that's happened and it ended up working out amazing so I tell them to go ahead with it. Their app makes me feel even more uneasy about where they're going with this character, but- It's not *terrible*. Not precisely what I envisioned, but still definitely seems to be pointing toward the relationship dynamic I've requested. At the end of the day, it's their character, not mine - and I want them to be happy with him and make him their own.\n\nThe app gets accepted and they're hyped. They're going to get a starter going for us immediately!\n\nThis is where everything goes wrong.\n\nThey proceed to write about 700 words detailing Chris sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park, reading the newspaper and drinking hot chocolate (but he pretends it's coffee to seem more manly). In his internal monologue, he thinks about this pretty girl in his class whose name he can't remember who he thinks had something bad happen to her, and about how she's seemed down lately. He wonders vaguely what had happened to her, but makes absolutely no mention of anything else, nor gives any reason in the starter to imply that anyone would have any reason to stop and interact with him. Just a guy, sitting on a bench in a busy area of NYC, drinking Starbucks and reading the paper.\n\nNaturally my character walks her friend's dog right past him, and that's the entirety of the thread, because there was no reason given for her to want to approach him, and it was made abundantly clear in his narrative that they didn't know each other even though my request said that they were close.\n\nThe person left the site not long after. Presumably because no one wanted to interact with them with starters like that.",

            "selftext": "So, this story happened around six to seven years ago. There was this site called Whirled that I would get on all the time to RP with my group. First things first, lemme introduce the characters in this story:\n\n\nMeta: Me, who had been the only girl that frequently logged on to the site in the group. Extremely nice, weeby, and had a tiny crush on one of my group members. \n\n\nKoop: The undisputed leader of the gang. He was really chill and always was there for everyone. However, he had a really fragile self esteem and couldn\u2019t really say no. \n\n\nKai: The hardass of the gang. He came off as a dick when you first met him, but when you got to know him, he was always there for you. Also the one I had the tiny crush on. \n\n\nWaffle: The one who played the bad guy in RPs. He was really into memeing and was pretty cool. Really into plot twists in the RP we did. \n\n\nXa: The oldest member of the group who most of us looked up to. He was in college for graphic design and was well known on the site for making avatars. Didn\u2019t really like to make people feel bad and was really sweet when he wanted to be. \n\n\nAlly: Our antagonist. She came into the group because Koop befriended her while hanging out in a public room on Whirled. Manipulated everyone, was playing the cringy \u2018shy anime girl\u2019, and would throw tantrums whenever things didn\u2019t go her way. \n\n\nSo, I had just gotten home from school and finished homework. This meant that I was allowed to get on Whirled to hang out with everyone. After I logged in and went to my group\u2019s usual spot, I could see Koop, Kai, Waffle, Xa... And a new person there. This room was private to only us, so I was pretty confused. That\u2019s when Koop saw that I had came in. \n\n\nKoop: Oh. Hi, Meta.\n\nMe: Heya! Who\u2019s this??\n\nKoop: This is Ally. I met her and she\u2019s interested in RPing with us.\n\nAlly: ........hi....\n\n\nAs soon as Ally said that, I felt something bad was gonna happen. I dismissed it though, because I had labeled it as me being prejudiced against people who RP\u2019d like that. After all, I just met her. \n\n\nMeta: I\u2019m Meta! Nice to meet you! :D\n\nAlly: .........you too......\n\n\nThat\u2019s when Kai PM\u2019d me. When I opened it up, I could see that they weren\u2019t going to get along.\n\n\nKai: I don\u2019t like her. She seems annoying. \n\nMe: Well, we just met. She might not be THAT bad\n\n\nOh, how I was wrong. I was so wrong that I would travel back in time to smack myself for even saying that.\n\nIn the next part, I\u2019ll be telling about the RPs we did together as well as her characters. ",

            "selftext": "Coming from the same group that has brought you reboot after reboot, we have... you guessed it... *another reboot!*\n\nHighlights of this one:\n\nHalf the original mod team quit. The new mod team is incompetent and power hungry. Half the mods aren't even aware of the rules and it's all clearly run by one person who was booted from another game for being so power hungry and trying to rewrite rules to suit himself. \n\nThe rules state that foreign characters are limited in number. Without any prelude or build up in the RP, the person passing for head mod wrote up a main plot post that issued an alliance and exchange program with a foreign place so he could start a new character that was foreign without running into the limits issue. The character also had a complete transfer of earnings despite the rules, and when questioned about this the mods said they're in the process of reevaluating a few rules.\n\nThere were several rules put in place that kept characters from growing too strong and the mods did away with them, so it's less newbie friendly now. The way it's set up, there was controlled growth and caps. The mods did away with that so the strong just get exponentially stronger and wealthier. It's discouraging for newcomers. \n\nThere was one feeble main plot story offered up at the beginning that was quickly taken over by the newest mods. Then it took them four more months to post another one that was really bad and just focused around making the mod characters the center of it with everyone else given very mediocre things. Those who were handed a very mediocre plot in which nothing of consequence happened were then chastised by the IC leadership for not doing better. \n\nThe OOC chat is focused around 'shipping and sexually explicit content regarding underage characters and \"breeding them\" together. \n\n",
