            "selftext": "This is a collection of a few short stories about some of my adventures on a roleplaying site that seemed to have a lot of users eager to force themselves on my character. For the record, some of these were either smut RPs or RPs where I was open to smut.\n\n\nLet's start off with a guy we'll call Minotaur, because that's what his character was. He starts us off with my character, M, wandering into and sleeping in Minotaur's bed. Nevermind my protests about how this would be out of character for her (and most people, for that matter). I roll with it to see what he has in store, and boy I was not prepared. Minotaur stumbles upon on M as she wakes up and immediately pins her against the wall of his cave. She protests and tries to get free, but Minotaur promptly blugeons her and knocks her out. I was honestly super confused at this point considering he wanted a more romantic, or at least a more gentle scene, from the start. M's loss of consciousness is immediately followed by a short, poorly written paragraph about how she is raped in her unconscious state and \"pumped full of [Minotaur's] children.\" Ew.\n\n\nWhen I asked Minotaur about why he suddenly started a rape scene without my consent, all he could say was \"I didn't know how to continue things.\" To say the least, I dipped pretty quickly after that.\n\n\nOur next story is about Noob, named as such due to his character being a novice mage. With M being a mage as well, I figured they would be a good match. For this, we explicitly agreed upon the scenario: Noob would accidentally cast a \"pleasure charm\" onto M during a friendly contest. It was unique for what I had seen that night, so I figured I'd roll with it. After the charm was cast, I had M mention that she should probably go back to her room since she was feeling odd. Suddenly, Noob starts acting all handsy on her, grabbing M in all sorts of places. M tells him to stop, since the spell was only supposed to affect her sensations, not her mind. This was met with a \"Why? Don't you like it?\" from Noob who pushed her down onto her bed. He revealed Noob was under the effects of the charm as well... despite that never being mentioned. It honestly seemed like the kind of scene I'd find fun with more build up and consent.\n  \n\nThe last story today is about Wolf and his edgy, OP rape attempt. This guy was the odd one out, playing a talking, spell-casting dire wolf. He started us off with Wolf locked in a jail cell as M interrogated him. Barriers were preventing him from using magic, but he specifically mentioned he could slowly undo the runes and free himself after some time. Apparently, \"some time\" means less than a minute, because he was free after M's first question.\n\n\nWolf was free and filled the cell block with darkness. I figured he wanted a fight RP, considering there was no mention of sex when we discussed the scenario. M casted a spell to illuminate the room and called for the guards... only to have them fall in front of her dead. Great. At that point I was pretty confused, since just killing the guards without a fight meant he didn't want a fight. Not only that, I was already beginning to pick up the rotten stench of an OP edgelord character.\n\n\nEverything became clear to me when Wolf \"stuck his snout in [M's] underclothes\" (which blatently violated every description of her outfit). It was one of those scenes, and it definitely wasn't going to be fun. I tried to salvage the RP, bringing more attention to the fight by having M counterattack and set up for a strong spell. Wolf, of course, decided that would interrupt his sexual plans and unleashed his aura that just stopped M from using magic. That's it. No autohitting on her or insane dodging, just nullifying her powers out of nowhere. With my enjoyment thoroughly dead and buried, I just disconnected.\n\n\nWhat really bugged me about Wolf is that he mentioned in his opening post that dire-wolves were almost completely wiped out by elves. With the ability to darken rooms, nullify magic, and kill armed guards without a sweat, I'm sure it was a real tragedy.",

            "selftext": "I joined a giant D&amp;D server that started as an LGBT and female\\-centric server. \n\nSome of their rules are a little weird, like no sexism or racism, which seems to lose some of the flavor of the universe. Even things typical like Orcs or Teiflings aren't well regarded isn't allowed. OK, whatever, we'll still have fun though, right?\n\nIn the campaign I joined, the party split up for a time and when we reunited there's the character Beth who has an NPC, Jenny, with her. No description is provided for Jenny beyond female half\\-Orc. Jenny replies to someone that she knows how to fight because \"daddy taught me\". Immediately I asked how old Jenny was, because up until now I thought she was an adult for some reason. Beth got prickly because apparently asking how old her girlfriend is constitutes negative commentary on their relationship, and she got huffy when I said, \"No, I just wonder how old someone is if they refer to their dad as daddy.\" Beth makes some huffy comments, but we get back to RP.\n\nLater we're splitting off to rooms. Beth and Jenny are going to share one of course. In the discord list there's suddenly a Beth\\-and\\-Jenny\\-Chat. I asked if this was meant as a private chat or public chat, because it looked like it meant to be private but I could see it. Beth again got all huffy and prickly and very defensive. I said that it didn't really matter, but it looked like the DM intended for it to be private and it wasn't. Beth had some more choice words and I just AFK'd because why argue over something like this? The DM came back and was all, \"Oh, I didn't set that up right, only Beth and I should be able to see it. Thanks for letting me know.\" Beth had something sour to say to that and I said nothing, cause why stir the pot?\n\nA few hours later one of the server admin messaged me to say that they'd received complaints \\(from Beth of course\\) that I'd been engaging in \"homophobic hate speech\". Then referenced the incidents above as hate speech. My point of view was dismissed because \"regardless of intent, the other party feels marginalized by your actions\". Well, okay then. And then banhammer came down. ",

            "selftext": "About a month ago, a guy with decent writing samples messaged me about doing a Rimworld RP.  I was SUPER excited because I'd been dying to do a Rimworld RP for quite a while.\n\nFor those not in the know, Rimworld is a game about people from an advanced civilization crash landing on a \"backwater\" sort of planet where human civilization has been devastated by malfunctioning robots and thrown back into the bronze age.  Groups with varying levels of tech, from spear-carrying tribals to bionic super soldiers, fight over resources to survive very harsh environments.  \n\nMy partner was going to play a group of crashlanded survivors.  I was going to play a group of slavers already established on the planet and one of their slaves, an ignorant tribal girl accidentally infected with mechanites (nanites) that gave her advanced medical knowledge.\n\n\nThings were ok at first.  His live writing was much worse than the samples he'd given me, and it took him a full day to write one measly paragraph, but I wanted to do a Rimworld story so badly that I kept going anyway.\n\nThis is where it broke down.  My post was pretty long so I'll summarize: two men with bionic legs carrying pistols advance to the crash site.  They find his character outside an escape pod tending to an injured woman in the pod. They run to him, drawing their guns and shouting to him to raise his hands or they'd shoot.\n\nThis is the response I got: \n\n&gt;Before [character] could react to the shout he was in the dirt. His limbs burned with electricity. His vision when went white. Someone was screaming. Was he screaming? A weight fell onto his back. \n\n&gt;The girl had tried to run. She knew what happened to people who got caught up at crash sites. She should have moved faster after getting out of the casket. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with this post that I strongly considered ghosting him immediately, but the guy was so nice I decided to talk to him about it.  \n\nI explained that, one, he can't control my characters.  That's godmodding.  At no point did I ever describe my characters carrying tasers or using them.  They were holding pistols so where did this even come from?\n\nSecondly, I can INFER that someone got tased in this post, but the character could just as well have been struck by lightning for all the detail I was given.  He doesn't even know if it was his own character that screamed.  I don't know what weight hit his back.  Was it the girl who tried to run?  Did the girl get tased also?  I appreciate writing in close third so maybe your character doesn't know exactly what happened, but you've at least got to let *me* know.\n\nHe accepted my criticisms very genially, agreed not to godmod, rewrote his post, and I thought everything was cool.  I wrote a post in response to his....\n\n...and he godmodded my medic slave treating his characters.  NOPE.\n\nI quietly ghosted and never heard from him again.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so I used to run a small RP community along with a co\\-owner of mine(they did most of the OOC bits of running it, while I did almost all the lore and GMing and such). It was going well, until the co\\-owner decided to invite one of their best friends from another community. This friend shall be dubbed \"Doom\" for the sake of this post, not only the name of one of their side characters, but also what they brought to the community itself.\n\nVery first thing Doom does, is introduce a character who claims to be on a journey to find 3 weapons he forged in a past life, which he will use to resurrect a clan of dead dragon gods(this right here, conflicted very heavily with the already set lore, but he didn't mind). What's worse, is that upon its first description, he claimed that one of the already existing character's weapons(which itself has very set\\-in\\-stone lore) was the 3rd weapon he was searching for, and stole it, without minding any resistance from the substantial fighter he just snatched it off of.\n\n Next, he summons his \"dragon gods\", who return to him the magic he had in his past life, essentially making him a god(even in a heavily magical world). And he promptly goes on another quest to summon a \"Void God\" that he slayed in his past life to put it down once and for all, and summoned such a god successfully. This \"Void God\", which was apparently the source of all evil ever, shook off blows from the gods of my world who came into the scene in protest, using a series of \"my power is unimaginable\" and \"You can not harm me, nats, muhuhaha\" as the character's defense. Then, Doom's main character simply kills it, \"dies\" from wounds taken in combat, and then comes back the next day as an even more power demon king god thing that is more powerful than the previous \"all\\-powerful void god\".\n\nWhat ensued was the classic plot of \"evil guy possessed mysterious side\\-main\\-character, let's save him so he can show his true power and help the original main characters smite bad guy once and for all\". Surprise! Void God is still alive, and Doom's possessed main character is much more powerful, but doesn't kill Void God. Also Doom's main character has actually been the king of gods this whole time, without knowing it himself, because memory loss. \n\nAt the 1 week mark(so just after he does his dragon\\-gods thing), I go to ban him, and due to friendship, my co\\-owner directly opposes such, letting him stay. Eventually, after 3\\-5 months of this guy barging into my plots whenever he wishes and power\\-playing the situation to go how he wants(and then I get it back on track while he is offline), I'm done with him, and I pull a questionable move from a GM standpoint, by awakening the classic slumbering all\\-god, in the form of having the universe incarnate show up just to kill him. Knowing that I have somewhat stooped to his level, I want to get this over with and fix my world from whatever he broke. So, I go without the usual \"Ima use my godliness to summon big boulders and throw them at you\" most people go with, and instead go with \"Ima make you not exist now\". So the universe itself goes to just erase him, and fails because suddenly Doom's character's soul is what \"holds every timeline together\" and therefore does not die, and the attack from literally existence itself made him stronger, somehow, he never really explained how. And Doom's character literally just, dropkicks the universe, and kills it, and absorbs its power somehow\\\\, and becomes existence itself.\n\nSo, having unleashed all in\\-game things I could possibly pull to maybe get him to leave on his own(again, co\\-owner shield he has, so can't ban), I just ban him. Of course, Co\\-owner adds him back, so I demote the co\\-owner, and then ban him again. A week later, after judging the damage he did and what it would take to fix, I took the opportunity to burn the community, form another from its ashes, and start over.\n\nAnything I could've done better, or was the whole \"universe itself trying to kill him at this point\" a little overkill, albeit overkill that failed?",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I\u2019ve talked about Ally with her introduction and her uncomfortable RPs. Now we\u2019re getting into the parts that I wish I did more to prevent.\n\n\nOur characters;\n\n\nMeta: Me, your friendly neighborhood pacifist weeb. \n\nKoop: The Leader of the gang, but has a hard time saying no to people he knows. \n\nAlly: Little miss snowflake, whose persona resembled a Mary Sue\u2019s. \n\n\nIt had been a few months after meeting Ally. During that time, she managed to force herself into becoming Koop\u2019s \u2018girlfriend\u2019 using emotional manipulation tactics on him such as claiming that she was \u2018depressed and was cutting herself\u2019, but whenever she was with Koop, she\u2019d feel \u2018happiness like she\u2019d never felt ever in her life\u2019. Koop\u2019s a bleeding heart and he just couldn\u2019t say no to those kinds of claims.\n\n\nWhenever I was on and met up with Koop, I would normally see Ally stuck right on him like a parasite and asking him to buy her stuff from the shop. And they weren\u2019t cheap. This began to make me feel concerned for Koop. I had known him for about two and a half years at the time and I knew when he was uncomfortable or unhappy.\n\n\nMy feelings about how he felt were confirmed about two weeks later when he came into my online room, asking for advice on how to dump Ally. Knowing her, I suggested that he bring her down gently by saying that he needed to have a little break. He felt like that approach was the right way to go and left the room. Not even five minutes later did I get a PM telling me that Ally was losing her shit and Koop didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI entered the room they were in and it was crazy. Ally was throwing a huge temper tantrum and exaggerating what I assume what Koop had said.\n\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI LOVED YOU, BUT YOU NEVER LOVED ME!!!\u201d\n\nBla bla bla. I tried to calm Ally down and Xa came over and tried to as well. Finally, after about an hour, she *finally* shut up. But this made Koop mortified. After this, he didn\u2019t get on as much and began to have even lower self esteem than before. He blamed everything that Ally had caused on himself because he had brought her into the group thinking she was nice. Soon, we didn\u2019t see him on much.\n\n\nAnd this was just the beginning. ",
