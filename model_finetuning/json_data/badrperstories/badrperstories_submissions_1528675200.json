The one I'm sharing today (these will be in no particular order) is about him wanting to be a DM (equivalent of a GM) again after his first ban (before the recent perma-ban). I finished RPing with him in the RP we started and picked it up again with another player. While I was doing this, A PMs me saying that I should stop using pictures and short descriptions, which I only do when I'm pressed for time or tired (which is most of the time since I stay up late RPing.)\n\nAnyway, I brush it off and say that I can DM anyway I want to as long as it gets the message across. Which it usually did. Most of the questions about my DM emotes were about minor things I missed, usually. A tells me that as a DM, I need to be descriptive and he cuts me off before I can reply by saying he can do a better job. \n\nI was kind of amused and I brought up his past behaviour as a reason for not letting him be a DM. He kept saying he changed and that I never forgive people, even though he doesn't know me at all. I try another route to dissuade him being a DM since all I could think of was the OP godmoding shit he pulled before.\n\nI tell him that with the new system the RP had, other DMs could only DM for their own faction while I did everything else. A complained and said that I never let him have a DM character, even though he killed his off a day prior because he got bored with him.\n\nI bring it up, and he brushes it aside. He wants to DM for NPCs in any faction. I refuse and he keeps desperately bringing up how he started the RP and had a right to DM it. He kept saying I never forgave people, again, and started to insult me. He said my server was a poor copy of another one we were both in, even though his would be an even poorer copy that was devoid of activity. He says my server would be dead without him, ignoring the dozens of other successful RPs I allowed various members to make. \n\nA threw a tantrum and left. Keep in mind, he is supposed to be in college (or he would have us believe). He came back later, apologizing profusely, but I knew it wasn't genuine. I put up with him so B and the other members wouldn't have to. At least, that was what I told myself.",

            "selftext": "So, this may be a bit long. But I figured that I'd give some proper context on this mess of a Conversation i'm going to show you.\n\nBasically. I run a somewhat secret group that focuses on reporting users who Break roleplay.me's rules. Since the site's community is quite a cesspool, and that's an understatement. Not to mention there are no moderators either. So you can expect people to easily disregard the site's rules. So, me and a few other users do this until the Admins add moderators to the site. We are Mostly driven by boredom, but hey. It gets the Job done.\n\nSo, as I was looking at the list of people to report. I saw a user that caught my eye quite a bit. She calls herself... \"The Dyke\". She seems to be basically a foul-mouthed bufoon that thinks she's... Well, A punk. She clearly breaks the rules and swears a lot. Because \"ugh muh teen angst\"\n\n(Pic #1)\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274259472518742018/455926776598888448/2018-06-11-23-41-50-1.png\n\n(Sorry for the Quality, by the way. My phone sucks and it's not built for this.)\n\nYou see. Stuff like this is not allowed in this site. But that doesn't stop people from doing it. Some go above and beyond to even do roleplays involving Rape or Child Molestation.  So, me and my fellow users seek out people like this to report and ban. Anyways, I Reported her as i always do with these and moved along. I checked later to see that her account was indeed banned. Yay for us. \n\nBut here comes the interesting bit. She made another account. Complaining that someone deleted her. \nFast forward a few days. And she's on her 8th ban.\n\n(Pic #2) \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274259472518742018/455926400843513859/Screenshot_2018-05-28-12-58-07-1.png\n\n... And as Salty as she ever was. Honestly. I kinda regret not Documenting some of her other complaints. Each of them worse than the others. (I recall her calling us A crybaby or something.) \n\nSo. We tried barganing with her. Saying she was breaking the rules and should stop. There are sites that are more lax with the rules, blah blah blah. But well. Judging from her profile. You can imagine how that went.\n(Spoiler: She told us to fuck off. Blocked us, got banned and this appeared when she remade her account.) \n\n(Pic #3) \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274259472518742018/455926401686831105/Screenshot_2018-05-28-00-01-34-1.png\n\n(This woman is 24 years old, by the way. Let that sink in.)\n\nYeah. So, Following one of my friends' advice. I did something that, in all honesty. Got us all laughing a lot. Like seriously. A lot.\nI decided to... \"Confront\" her about it. \nAnd with \"confront\". I mean. Try to piss her off as much as I could. Which clearly yielded great results.\n\nHere it is. In it's glory. Stitched together by one of my friends too. (I blurred out my name. For the sake of keeping it a secret. I changed it as well since it has been a while since this happened. Which was last month btw.)\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/261563973848137729/455925977533513728/wip_10.png\n\nShe's in her 13th ban as I am writing this. Today is June 12. And she refuses to change. I think she might be insane, folks. \nShe seems to have been once again banned fairly recently too. Any thoughts?",
