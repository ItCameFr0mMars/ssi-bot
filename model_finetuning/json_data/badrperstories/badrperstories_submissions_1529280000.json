            "selftext": "I keep meaning to type up and post these, because who doesn't like even the most minor of drama related to Pern? My problem is I get wordy, so I've done my best to cut that down a bit. I have several stories, though, so I will end up posting more in the future.\n\nSo. Pern. I'm wary about playing in this world anymore. I love the dragons and I love the shenanigans but the people I seem to run into? Not so much.\n\nLet's start with the first site I joined, foreshadowing prevelant as the invitation to try it out came from someone posting in the BRPS LJ community years ago. I accepted said invitation and while the site had what I considered a ridiculous number of fan colours (I mostly preferred to stick to canon colours as much as I could, and my second site would reflect this desire), I still decided to give it a whirl. The people I will be referring to throughout this whole ordeal that are major players will have the following nicknames:\n\nPrimary, the main admin who barely posted\nSecondary, secondary admin who posted slightly more\nMod, very active and the one who initially invited me\n\nEveryone else I'll just nickname in their story snippet, as most of them only warrant snippets.\n\nDespite trying to summarise as much as I can, I will apologise for the length. This post includes several instances of wat. Note that this all happens over a period of about four months nearly a decade ago.\n\nPersonally, at the time I joined this site, I had never RPed in anything more than script-style chats in 1x1 or groups of 3. A messageboard was new territory for me as well as third-person prose for RP. This might be why I stuck around past several small red flags as I got used to the format. \n\nProblem the first involved someone I'll call Mint. I came in just as she decided to cause her character to have a miscarriage due to a fall down the stairs. I'm all for drama, but even this made me immediately wary of Mint. It was just a primary indication of how she worked, though having no other points of reference, I brushed it off as just one of those things players do. The thing is though, Mint was also in charge of the current Hatching that was coming up, for which I had created a Candidate and requested that he not Impress. I wanted to get a feel for things before I went all-in, and being active in a Hatching without creating more work for someone at that late date seemed to be a good way of doing it. \n\nBesides, not Impressing always felt like a great character development point for me. Still does.\n\nThe Hatching finally comes and Mint has written a whole clutch of dragons. With this being the first time I had taken part in something like this, I was interested to learn that things like this were often themed. Having read the books, too, I was aware of dragonets' penchant for sometimes harming Candidates. I was not prepared for how much gore and destruction Mint doled out. One Candidate (NPC) died, one Candidate (also NPC) nearly died, and my boy got attacked by a hatchling bronze who seemed to do it for entirely no other reason than because he wanted to. No fear at all. Just a desire to harm. Completely different from the idea of awkward, frightened hatchlings just trying to find their riders. This one had purpose. My boy ended up with his arm slashed open, which would ultimately leave a pretty ugly scar. Several other Candidates also narrowly escaped this newborn wrath which was, to me, entirely out of place. Even now I look back on this and wonder WTF. To top it all off, the weather was the predictable nighttime thunderstorm.\n\nAfter this Hatching is when I learned the 'theme' Mint had written for all of them. Mental Illnesses. \n\nYeah.\n\nPrimary and Secondary's only real response to it was to make her rewrite the one with the theme of disassociative identity disorder to something else.\n\nAt this point I had made friends with several people, including one person I'm still friends with today, so I stuck around. My boy now had a form of PTSD due to that horror he wasn't prepared for and ended up afraid of bronze dragons as a result. This was something I wanted to work him through before the next Hatching so that it would make sense for him to Impress, if I decided to let him. I basically made the best out of it.\n\nThen comes Contradiction. Contradiction's character was bonded to a dragon, but Contradiction's character _hated_ his dragon. Now anyone who knows Pern, whether they've read the books, RPed, or just read bad RPer entries about it, knows that riders and dragons have nothing less than the most intensive, co-dependant love bond with one another from the instant the dragon is Impressed. In no way will a rider ever hate his dragon. Except this one did, and it was allowed. There were whole threads where the player wrote the character hating his dragon.\n\nOne player (I will call them Wolf), then, adopts a dragon from a past clutch that Secondary had written. This clutch had a normal, anime-inspired theme (I forget the anime as I wasn't all that interested). Wolf's interpretation of this dragon's personality, however, wasn't perfect in Secondary's eyes, and Secondary got openly upset with Wolf about it. Secondary insisted that Wolf's misinterpretation of the character was an affront and demanded that they try to be a lot closer to the character inspiration. Pretty ludicrous, in my eyes, and in Wolf's eyes too. They did their best to accomodate, but ultimately said that their interpretation is their interpretation and Secondary really sort of needed to chill (not in those words, but that was the gist). \n\nAt around this point in time several things overlap, but order doesn't entirely matter. Primary hasn't been all that active with posting, while they are active in the cbox. They decide to create a new character. With dwarfism. Not really all that canon (Not that the site was even close to being even semi-canon), but no one had a problem with that. What we had a problem with was their placeholder text that completely made fun of dwarfism and wasn't at all complimentary. When confronted about how offensive it was, they argued that it was 'just a joke' and ignored everyone's concerns.\n\nThis next one is what started me packing up, while what happened after is what caused me to completely leave. Mod had just hit a benchmark on the site that awarded them with a unique, one-off mutation they got to choose. At this point multiple players had been asking about and wanting white dragons to be canon for the site, and Mod had other plans. Because these unique mutations are only ever one-offs and couldn't ever be replicated, they told me that their plan was to make their unique mutation a white dragon, laughing about how it would be rubbed in everyone's faces who had asked for it to be site canon because at that point no one else could get one. I wasn't thrilled with this sort of attitude from anyone, but especially from a site mod in particular, so I copied the conversation and contacted Primary and Secondary with my concerns. The unique one-off didn't end up being a white dragon, but that wasn't the end of things not making sense. The character Mod decided to Impress it to was an albino with all the trimmmings, including easily broken bones and poor strength. As a rider on a fighting dragon. Multiple people spoke up about how this made little sense but were ignored, and, well, they can run their site as they wish, can't they?\n\nOver this period of time they had opened up moderator applications, and a friend I'll call Snake applied. Despite Primary and Secondary seemingly needing this second moderator position filled ASAP, they dragged their heels on choosing, taking nearly a month before finally announcing Snake's induction to the team. Snake then immediately went about making strong, good suggestions for things that could be done to improve the site as a whole, only to be rebuffed at every turn. These suggestions, I should add, didn't come out of nowhere unasked for. The admin team actually wanted such active contribution.\n\nTrigger Warning for this next paragraph, as it involves forced sexual encounters (dragon), and I'm not talking about Flights.\n\nThe final straw was when a friend of the admins joined. This person, whom I will refer to as Scram, had what had to be the worst dragonpair I will ever have to tell about, and for one reason only. The dragon half of the dragonpair was written as often forcing themselves on other dragons outside of flights, which basically meant that it was what everyone ended up referring to as RapeDragon, because that was what it was. Scram liked to laugh about this, and the admins didn't shut it down at all. Scram was allowed this character despite multiple people speaking up about how uncomfortable and wrong it was, and since the admin team wasn't listening to these concerns, I had decided that it was time for me to move on entirely. \n\nI left the site behind without raising a fuss, and that is important to note for Pt. 2. I contacted those I had threads with through PMs and apologised for not being able to finish them, and left by the next activity check. Unfortunately it wouldn't be my last encounter with the site's admin team, however, but that's for Pt. 2.",

That SHOULD have been the first warning bell, but hey, I'm desperate. I haven't had a good text game in years. \n\nWelp. At game start, there's still eight people.

You've got \"I do x,\" \"I would do x,\" and \"Name does x\" warring away. I prefer the latter, but I'm in the minority. And then there's people waffling between the two styles apparently at random. \n\nI can work around that. I think. Aaaaaaaand then things hit the fan for real.

            "selftext": "[Part 1 is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/8t01c9/sans_pern_dramu_pt_1/), and introduces the majority of people I reference here. As a recap:\n\nPrimary: the head admin of Site 1 in Part 1\nSecondary: the second admin for Site 1 in Part 1\nMod: the site mod who rounds out Site 1's leadership triad in Part 1\n\nSnake: a friend I made on Site 1\nWolf: a friend of Snake's I also befriended on Site 1\n\nI also have Archer, whom I'm still friends with to this day, who is good peoples, and who is also friends with Mod.\n\nHonorary mention: Scram, who had the dodgy TW dragon. \n\nDrama this time does not involve bad RP or dodgy characters, but butthurt and my own anxiety and spinelessness.\n\nI apologise for length. \n\n----\n\nAround the last month of my being on Site 1 that I talked about in Part 1, I had off-handedly mentioned to Snake, Wolf, and Archer (at separate times) that I almost wanted to make my own Weyr. This would end up being inadvisable and ill-decided on my part, as it did end up fizzling out due to my lack of skill and lack of backbone at the time. They all jumped on board. Snake and Wolf had wanted to make their own site for awhile, and with my wanting to do one as well, we all decided to make it together. We opened up a group chat in Skype, shared a googledoc for planning, and went at it.\n\nAs everything started to go down on Site 1, I started getting a lot more drive for my own site. I had also joined another, canon colours only site and was slowly integrating myself into there. This site is spotlit in Pt. 3.\n\nBecause I was excited, I started pushing the rest of the group to help finish writing up all of the common Pern information, the setting (made up Holds, Weyr, and shields/badges for them), the plot, the main characters to be run for the plot until we could integrate player characters into good solid leadership roles, and the like. Getting Snake and Wolf to write more than just minor ideas was like pulling teeth, and while Archer was a help with writing up shop lists and other things, it ultimately fell to me to buckle down and write the majority of everything else. So I did. I also made up the plot, let Wolf take on the main, horrible main character for the plot (your stereotypical weyrwoman who was supposed to treat everyone as dirt beneath her heel). I did this, installed the board software (selfhosted), and created the new Holds, Weyr, and their shields.\n\nBecause at the time I was really strictly a fan of being as close to canon for dragon colours as possible, minus the sexuality impressions, I only created one new colour, a red, that was for females to Impress. It was situated between browns and blues and shared brown ranking. The fun twist to these reds was that, while the red dragon always existed in our lore (I didn't want to have to deal with the stereotypical mutation BS at the time), Kitti Ping done screwed up when it came to the reds somehow and half the time they ended up fertile and unable to chew firestone, just like golds (which is canon in the actual books, but arguable over time I know). The fun for these was that the player wouldn't know until firestone lessons whether or not they had a fertile red or a fighting dragon. The idea went over really well, too, I am proud to say. I describe this, as the reds ended up being one of the points of contention.\n\nSo it's done. Snake arted us a pretty banner, we created the board. By this time the last of the BS on Site 1 had been happening and I contacted those I had threads with and apologised for leaving them undone, but I was leaving the site. I didn't say where, and I didn't say why, and only told people that I had opened my own if they asked me directly. If they then asked for the link, I gave it to them then and only then.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that not only did I leave, but at least five others left with me of their own volition. Particularly Snake and Wolf, while Archer stayed. On a site where the max number of players over those four months fluctuated between 12-15 at most? It created a noticeable hit. \n\nSo we opened our board. We gained a few players, and the ones that left with us were active with us. I kept around 10 active threads and continued to do my best to advertise and garner interest. Not even a week goes by before drama starts.\n\nI must note that it started when I was asleep. I woke up to the beginnings of the results of what ended up being quite the dumpster fire.\n\nFor them.\n\nPrimary, Secondary, and Mod all come into our site chatbox and start innocently asking questions, purposely bucking any site canonical decisions we had made in regards to how we wanted dragons coloured or who we wanted to Impress them to. They got disruptive to the point where Snake decided to shut down the cbox entirely to visitors. A decision I reversed once I woke up, but ultimately the best decision to have been made at the time as Snake had to go to class and no one else could keep moderating their BS. \n\nThis resulted in what I have to say is my proudest. Moment. Ever. \n\nI got my very own entry on the LJ bad rp community. By Primary. The entry is actually still there, though Primary's text is gone because they deleted it themselves. All of the comments (over 100!) are still there, though, and if you go digging for it, you see that from point one no one believed that Primary was anything but butthurt and I had done nothing wrong. Secondary and Mod are also in the comments trying to defend Primary's entry and position while putting the new Weyr down, and on my side I had polite comments by Snake and Wolf and eventually me pointing out calmly where they were overreacting and incorrect. My memory isn't exact of course, as this was 8 years ago. \n\nFrom my vague recollection, the bad RP rant included screencaps of part of my site (which allowed people to eventually locate it and join) trying to detail how I had stolen ideas from them. They particularly pointed out the shop had similar things (that were pretty much common across multiple Pern sites that limited such things) and made the biggest stink about the red dragons. Look, look how they have red dragons! Look where they are in the dragon ranking, just below brown where ours are! Look at how that is obviously ripping us off! Note though, that their red dragons were boy/girl twins from a single egg, every time, while ours were female and only part of the time were fertile. By luck of the draw.\n\nSomewhere in there, either the post or the comments, they said that if I had problems with them, I should have approached them directly. I pointed out all of the times I had (as mentioned in Pt. 1, any time anyone had a problem with something as mentioned there, I was one of the people who approached them about it), I had been brushed off or ignored and nothing had been done. They claimed that I left in a fit. I pointed out I left silently while apologising to everyone I was involved in a thread with. Ultimately enough people looked at everything critically and shut them down, resulting in Primary deleting the entry's text and skulking off. \n\nBut not until I had invited them, through those comments, to approach me directly if they had a problem with me. They took me up on this, and all three of them brought me into a group chat to tell me how I had stolen things and how I was such a horrible person for it. At the time I had to leave to help out my aunt, so while I initially listened and answered a few things, I apologised and told them that i would have to continue this in a couple of hours, which I did. Primary, though, was no longer available to chat, and it was with Secondary and Mod that I completed the conversation.\n\nI was alone in it. Snake and Wolf didn't offer to help or back me up, though Archer did. Since Archer was really good friends with Mod, though, I didn't want to put Archer in that position, thanked them, and pulled through on my own. Anxiety riding high. Throughout this whole ordeal it had taken quite a toll on me.\n\nUltimately the chat ended with a reasonable truce. I had agreed to delete certain shop items (that I didn't like all that much in the first place, but it was a group decision), but the red dragons were finally accepted as realistically different and not, in any way, shape, or form, inspired or copied from theirs. Ultimately Secondary and Mod were done with it all, and after that was when Primary sulkingly (I'm assuming, considering the resulting message that replaced the original entry) got rid of the entry on the LJ community, resulting in a ban for doing so. \n\nThis ends anything to do with Primary, Secondary, and Mod, though I do know that Mod now runs a successful Weyr in their own right these days. I can't say whether they've changed or not, but since the Weyr in question is still active after so many years, I'm guessing that they have. I still avoid them for obvious reasons, no matter how much we retain in common.\n\nThis doesn't end the site drama of my own Weyr.\n\nAs I mentioned, I had pretty bad anxiety. Opening my own Weyr was a pretty ill-conceived idea, and while I had handled everything with the Admin Triad well, I was stressed out. I had to take a break from my own Weyr and all I wanted to do was spend a month being a player. So I took a leave of absence and played on that canon-colour site for about a month while being only moderately involved in keeping an eye on my own Weyr while I destressed about the whole situation.\n\nWhen I returned, however, I decided that I wanted to create a new character to add to the five I already had, and the threads I already had. I contacted those I had those threads with and continued those who wanted to be continued, started planning plots with others, and started taking player concerns privately again. My IC post count at the time far exceeded my co-moderators' and co-admin's, still, after a whole month of being inactive. I note this because of the comment from Wolf that I got when I mentioned that I was creating a new character that would be taking a very much needed plot slot on the site (and could also be set aside if a player wanted that slot themselves). I was told that I hadn't even been participating, that I hadn't even been posting, so that I shouldn't be creating a new character at all. \n\nNote that I had 10 active threads over five active characters, some of which were new and others were from the month before that friends agreed to continue. My post count was almost three times Wolf's, and I had just come back from a hiatus. So yes, coming back from a hiatus only to create a new character can be frowned upon, but when you factor in that I had already booted up all the rest, it was something I didn't see was a problem at all. \n\nWolf continued to make a big deal out of this, and Snake, being their friend for a long time, backed Wolf up on it. Archer didn't see a problem with my decision at all since we had plans ourselves. I ultimately spinelessly dropped that character to keep the peace, and moved on. \n\nDuring this time several players had approached me with ideas, and not just ideas, but things they wanted to do plot-wise in the site-wide. Wolf, as I had mentioned a long time ago, had taken up the very plot-centric Weyrwoman whose sole reason of being was to treat everyone else like so much dirt. Unfortunately both in the time I was gone as well as in the short time I had returned, Wolf had done nothing of the sort. I approached her asking her to do this for the plot everyone had agreed to, only to get the response that 'no one would want to play with a character like that.' But... that was the plot you had been excited about before we even opened?\n\nI pointed out that that was wrong. Not only did I want to play with a character like that, several people (I left unnamed) had directly requested to have threads with a character like that. To be treated horribly and run off. Maybe even driven out of the Weyr because drama. Both Wolf and Snake told me, then, that they didn't think I was capable of playing a character like the Weyrwoman anyway, so ultimately I should just quiet up about it. \n\nThis ended up derailing the entire point of the initial site plot, and I felt as if despite the fact that they had made me head admin, and despite the fact that I had to handle that whole thing with the Admin Triad before on my own, I was only there to play their figurehead and to take all the heat.\n\nWith that feeling taking root, I ultimately handed over the reins and excused myself from the site as a whole, moving all of my attention to the canon-colours site I had joined and continued to play on previously. \n\nDidn't stop me from april fools' day pranking the thing in April, though. Replaced all of the art with pretty bad stick representations of everything, and no one knew who did it (but ultimately thought was pretty amusing). \n\nPt. 3 has to do with the canon-colours site I joined and me ultimately being spineless there, too.
