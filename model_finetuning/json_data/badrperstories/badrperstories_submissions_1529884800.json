            "selftext": "I've been RPing in one form or another for about 17+ years now so I have a hand full of bad stories :-D; this is the most recent and close to the most disturbing for me. \n\nI recently joined a Discord for a group Star Wars RP; I looked around and quickly found out these guys didn't match my style very well, I'm into detail and generally post multi-para (3-5)  but they were 1 liner to 1 para. Thats not inherently bad just not my style, but I didn't have much going on so I rolled with it and adapted; soon I was driving the story more than the 'GM' was. Again not exactly a 'bad thing' more disappointing because I'm ALMOST always the one that plays the GM role and was ready to kick back for once. Then I started noticing that a lot of their OOC chatter was very adult themed but I figured IC is IC and OOC is OOC so there shouldn't be a problem. Anywho I digress.\n\nIt got bad when the group entered an ancient Dark Temple; the leader of the group who was a rouge Sith lord began emoting something about being nervous that her vision was going to come true, THEN I got a message from the GM saying that said: &lt;The Darkness influences you&gt; \"She wants you so bad; take her... take her now and kill anyone who tries to get in your way!\" So basically my character who was a mercenary/ not so intelligent/ not Force sensitive at all type was being influenced by the Dark Side to take this chick against her will in the middle of this temple and kill anyone who doesn't agree.\n\nNow... I admittedly have very few triggers when it comes to RP; even though this type of thing is one of them if I had a partner who I really trusted, and really... REALLY wanted to explore that it wouldn't be completely off the table. That being said; in all my time RPing I've only done smut a hand full of times and that was mostly in my teen years so its obviously really low on my list of priorities. The really disturbing part was they knew noting about me OOCly; not how long I've been RPing, what my experiences were, and I get that people lie (I did when I was underage) but they never even asked how old I was or if I was comfortable with NSFW. I could have been a traumatized kid for all they know!\n\nI read the message when I woke up in the morning and left it for about 24 hours; I reread it at least 20 times throughout the day to make sure I was reading it right before I sent him a message saying I wasn't comfortable at all. I really didn't see any point in conversing anymore so I left the Discord.",

            "selftext": "Using a throwaway to reduce the chances of my rpmates linking this back to me.\n\nSo I'm part of this rp. It's been going on for years now, and I joined pretty early on. It's based on an actual series, and so, one of my characters is a cannon character, with cannon relationships I love with other characters. Unfortunately, I've had the absolute worst luck with that. Some of those characters simply can't seem to hold an rper in this game.\n\nAnd then there's this one. Canonically, this character is one of my char's closest friends, so I was excited when I saw that someone was playing them. Well, as it turns out, my joy was premature, because after the first few months, the player seemed to have lost interest in the rp. Now, normally, this would have just caused their claim on the character to time out after a couple weeks of inactivity, but the problem here was that the player was a high ranking staffer and just so happened to provide the infrastructure for us to host the game on, for free. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to them for that, but this has pretty much made them untouchable.\n\nAt this point, several years into the game, it's pretty clear that they're just not interested in the theme. They've popped in periodically, but each time it became more and more clear that they were just doing it out of some sense of obligation or guilt. The last time, it was pretty clear that they popped in because the other staffers relayed my grumblings on the subject to them. I don't hold it against them that they're not interested, but honestly, I feel like it would be in everyone's best interests if they stopped pretending that they're going to come back. I don't want to guilt them into coming back if they're not interested, that does no one any good, but I really do wish that they would just drop the character, and give me atleast some semblance of hope that I might be able to rp with that relationship. They haven't actually rped in months.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I'd brought this issue up before, several times even, but nothing substantial came of it. The last time I did, I just got a \"Well, they host the game, so there's nothing we can really do *shrug*\". That was months ago. I'm honestly tempted to risk another prod, maybe ask if staff would be willing to ask this person if they'd be willing to drop the character, instead of just showing up for a guilt-induced scene every half a year. It's just a little aggravating. ",

But I wanted to share it as a warning and to describe how badly I screwed up by just not saying \"hey can you let it go for a bit\". I hope if I ever start up a similar RP I'd still have him play but just let him now a bit more firmly that he was bothering me.\n\nI've been an on and off roleplayer since my early teen years and have generally focused on superhero RPs, (mostly freeform) and am often the GM running the roleplay. After so many sandbox rps taken out by Godmodders or just mods who couldn't or wouldn't say no to everyone's ideas, (to be fair, I was VERY guilty of this until a few years ago) I decided to run a small, very structured group RP. The basic idea was one inspired by Super Sentai or Power Rangers. Basically a team of four magical superheroes were trained from birth to inherit their parents powers and stop magical beings from threatening a modern city. \n\n I also added a villain slot.\n\n I didn't want to just have the heroes play but didn't want to get a super large playerbase. So I offered a minion slot as one of the options. This \"minion\" had an extensive backstory that gave him powers beyond my main villain. Would talk back to everyone in the evil organization, and frequently fought or threatened all the heroes no matter what else was going on at the time. In addition, because I wanted to bounce ideas off of him and make it so anyone playing the minion knew what was going I on I let him in on the villains secret identities, (their were numerous NPCs in this hero game and secretly some were also villains or other magical creatures) Maybe I should have offered him some other objectives or given him a more personal mission? But anyway, after undermining everyone and predicting how the battle was about to go he proceeded to send a book to one of our heroes houses. Detailing the main villains backstory extensively and giving the heroes everything they had to go on but the main villains civilian name! I had a slight word with him and he seemed to let up a little, but sent me more extensive backstory about his character in a private message. Eventually I decided to just continue but do to player inactivity and my own almost unexplained frustration that an RP I gmed was being undermined by what was essentially a secondary character we quit. \n\n Just a warning GM's, even non-godmodding actually good roleplayers can screw up your game if you don't stand up once in a while. Just put a little backbone in your position.",
