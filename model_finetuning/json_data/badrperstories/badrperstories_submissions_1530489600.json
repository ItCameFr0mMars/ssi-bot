            "selftext": "When it comes to role playing, I tend to gravitate towards beefier, rough and mean characters. At first it was merely preference, but only after roleplaying for several years did I realize just how much I dislike mage rpers. I am pretty sure I\u2019ve boiled it down to a simple statement that I personally believe is true (pls don\u2019t jump down my throat, this is just in my experience.)\n\nA warrior/rogue can have many years of experience in all forms of their craft. Namely, hurting things with sharp objects. This skill can be god-tier, but only really applies to physical uses. Pushing a boulder, grappling an ogre. But if you put a warrior on a sheer cliff and tell them to jump off without dying, they simply can\u2019t. Muscle and fists can\u2019t stop gravity. Nor can it stop drowning, or poison, or burning to death. I think that offers a lot of conflict when it comes to playing grizzled veterans, because no matter how hard you punch your veins, that poison ain\u2019t comin\u2019 out \n\nThis isn\u2019t the same for mages. I say mages, but this also comes to healers as well. They are able to defuse and end any conflict through spells, because, as the title says, there\u2019s a spell for that. I only recently ended an rp with a group of (from here on out I\u2019ll just call them casters, cuz that\u2019s what we called em collectively) casters for these very reasons.\n\nOur first character is God. Literally God. He\u2019s a 70000000000 million bajillion years old, and needs both your\u2019s, his, and your friends fingers and toes to count exactly how many magical fields he has \u2018studied\u2019 under. This, of course, is code for \u201cI know all of these things as if I created them.\u201d Several events, large and small, were trivialized and destroyed by this one character alone. God was god and didn\u2019t care how much time and effort you put into your post or story, he had a spell that would insta-solve and problems. Did I mention he\u2019s also built like a Greek sculpture, and has \u2018alluring\u2019 spells cast upon him at all times? Nice try, ladies, but you have no choice but to actively resist him or your character *WILL* swoon ;).\n\nOne story (thankfully the last, as this is where it came to a head) stands out for god. The group, my bulky shield-bearing knight, a shaved-headed, wild, warrior woman who could probably bench more than the knight, God, and another female healer we\u2019ll call the Nurse. Now these four were adventuring, searching for a hydra that was terrorizing a farmer and his family. When we first met them, it was an interesting little interaction where the old man, who referred to the hydra as a \u2018critter\u2019 said he was getting to old to keep chasing it off with his rifle. How old man Jenkins was able to scare off a hydra was kept vague, therefore allowing for the surprise for the characters. A mixture of \u201cthat\u2019s not a critter\u201d and \u201chow did that old man scare this thing off?\u201d.\n\nAt least it would\u2019ve been if there hadn\u2019t been a spell for that. God, after having had the conversation, walked out back to the field and began mind-reading the cows. When he was told that the only thing these cows were thinking about was grass and the devouring of said grass, he elaborated.\n\n\u201cNo no, I mean he reads their memories back in time, to see what the monster is and finds out it\u2019s a hydra.\u201d\n\nHe then ensures that everyone else\u2019s surprise is spoiled by having his character walk in and proudly state that he found out what the monster was and where they could go to find it. Luckily, he learned extensively about every monster in existence, so he could track it with another spell that would make its tracks glow. You can already see exactly our issue with this, but, even though it pained me to do so, we ran with it. Throughout the journey, our boy God was sure to put the moves on both females incessantly. Using spells to shield them from water spraying from a waterfall, use a spell to keep them specifically extra toasty and warm during the camp, using spells to track them when they went to... bathe. \n\nDespite both characters obviously not showing interest (funnily enough, the knight, who was given none of these benefits and slept on a godamn rock while God used spells to make everyone else sleep fine, was beginning to gain the attentions of the two women), he persisted, even going OOC to state that they\u2019d need a good reason to be able to resist his charm spells. Their reason was never enough, so he kept trying to no avail. But the worst part wasn\u2019t the flirting, or the destruction of the entire investigation aspect of the story.\n\nIt was what happened when the found the damn hydra. Our post order, due to a roll we did early on, left our boy always going first. And it was probably the reason he managed to fuck so much up on a regular basis. \n\nSo the hydra introduction is written, and it\u2019s many heads slither into sight, hissing and pissed off. Of course this post was meant to be the \u201coh shit it\u2019s a hydra\u201d post, to build up its ferocity and scariness. It reared back, hood flared out, many, *many* teeth dripping with poison and malice. And then God posted.\n\n\u201cGod knows these creatures well, and, before it could attack and do harm to his lovely ladies, he sends two large blades of mana out. These blades curve through every head, and center in on the one, *true* head, severing it nearly. God turned around as the beast fell and grinned at his companions.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot him.\u201d\n\nThe chat was in an immediate uproar. Not only had he fucking KILLED THE REASON FOR THE STORY in one hit, in one post, before anyone could even react to it, he\u2019d had the AUDACITY to turn around and look at the rest of them like they were just apprentices following an exterminator. Not only that, but, despite our exclamations and responses, he still had the nerve to ask each of his sweeties if they had any presents for the cuties.\n\nThat being said, the warrior woman shanked him and then OOC we told him to fuck off and go play his shitty god-modded character elsewhere. Honestly this happened not three days ago, but I really do not care if God sees this. Hopefully he takes it into account and changes.",

            "selftext": "I was looking through some posts and all on this one website when I found one that interested me in a genuine way.\n\nThis person wanted to play a game of 4 mobsters who were adopting 4 children who would have been played by me. I'm always alright with playing more than one character as the plot doesnt get dull quickly with just one, especially with how rping children can be.\n\nWe connect, we talk about characters and everything, and since I usually like to start in rp's since I know that some people are paranoid about people auto- disconnecting without telling the problem, I started with the intro to all of the kids in the orphanage and what exactly they were doing.\n\nOne was a shy type, one liked video games, one was aggressive and another was smart from what I remember of these characters.\nIt was a relatively long post since there were four characters and I had to explain their backgrounds and appearance since personality was already discussed. The backgrounds weren't anything traumatic either, just not wanting one when they were born because of anti abortion, that kind of thing. Doesn't really matter.\n\nWhat they took issue with though, is that one of these kids happened to be both blonde and Korean. I don't know why they were so concerned with this, but apparently it was a big deal to them. I explain that it is possible that Koreans can be blonde naturally, especially if their kids since kids hair darkens.\n\nI didn't feel like I was being strict or stubborn, I was just confused of why they seemed so against that specifically. I voiced this and then they disconnected because this was apparently a big deal breaker.\n\nThis was a long time ago so I was pretty salty about THAT ruining something I was interested in, so when I saw the post again I kind of wanted to them that it was ridiculous that the hardest thing to believe in this scenario where four gangsters adopt four kids legally and unnoticed as far as background checks go, that the hardest thing to believe was that one of the kids happened to be both blonde and Korean. \n\nI also questioned if they were racist or something, even though I'm not entirely sure of that, and then I disconnected before they could say anything because I was salty that I had spent all that time writing something so long.\n\nThey made an edit at the end of their post addressing me (not by name or anything, just me in general) saying that they may have overreacted and whatever, so at least they learned something.\n\nI'm a very salty person and I know I shouldn't have ranted to them, but I never called them any names, only really questioned their morals.",

            "selftext": "It bugs me when people try to use combat encounters to RP...  Our sessions have plenty of opportunity to RP outside of combat, but some of our players literally put their allies at risk for RP flights of fancy or other flawed RP reasonings, and I find it irritating.  These are supposed to be professional, seasoned adventurers - not children. (all examples are Level 10+)\n\nSome Examples:\nMelee PC sees what they know in advance to be the boss of the dungeon, and stays 80ft back while diplomacy slowly fails over a period of several minutes both real time and game time.  The PC Lives to fight and Drink, and literally worships the god of war, yet felt like he would rather stay 80ft back from the rest of the party and spend 3 turns to get into the fight so he can stay next to his NPC Brothers who hate his guts.\n\nMost powerful caster simply abstains from combat and lets enemies attack their friends, because they want to make friends with the enemy, even though diplomacy failed, and allies are going down.  Same player invested feats ensure they win Initiative rolls, and did nothing with those turns for the past many combat encounters.  The same Caster has actively healed enemies during combat (not after) in the past, and that wasn't even an encounter the party was losing.\n\nBarbarian repeatedly misses because they use power attack all the time while in rage. (Come on, he may not be smart, but he knows how to fight, and continuing to try something that isn't working is insanity, not stupidity. Also 8 INT isn't stupid, that's why it's 8, not 2.)\n\nPC Ignores class features that would save lives of allies because they want to activate them with a story trigger that they haven't even planned out with the DM yet...

            "selftext": "This isn't an exact story of something that bothers me, more just three things that happen a lot (at least to me) that make me so mad.\n\n1. Grammar Nazi's\n Sometimes, back when I liked script style rp's\n\nwhich, by the way, can we stop calling paragraph style rp's 'literate rp's'? It sounds EXTREMELY insulting to those who like or only have time for script rp's\n\nI would usually start with a simple 'Hi' with no period. I didn't go out of my way to do this, it just kind of happened, but apparently that one dot means everything to some people. Usually they just leave if they're not interested, as you should, but some people have the need to say.\n\n((Can we make this literate?\n\nAnd I know that they don't mean to sound insulting (probably) and so I'll start to extra check my replies but God forbid, if I make ONE mistake, like not capitalizing an I, they will make sure I know.\n\nThe worst part is when they're complete hypocrites and tYp3 l1K3 Th15 (and no, they weren't playing Mituna)\n\n2. Kind of sort of maybe metagaming\n\nI'm not sure if this would count as metagaming, and if it does it's honestly not that bad I guess, but it does kind of ruin my immersion.\n\nWhat I mean is that my character will say something when just meeting someone like \"Ya like jazz\" and then my character would try to think of how they shouldn't get attached to someone right away because they could be homophobic or racist or something.\n\nIt wasn't meant as an insult to the other person's character, it was just in character for my character to think like that.\n\nBUT THEN, they say something like,\"oh yeah jazz is cool, by the way did I show you my 'gay pride', 'all lives matter', and 'I'm a great person' buttons?\"\nI sigh so heavily. \n\nYes, because instead of just revealing this information naturally, how about you literally tell everyone you just meet about your morals in the middle of a completely different conversation. \n\n3. Being obliviously sexy (or something)\n\nI HATE this one. If you want me to think you're attractive, be charming or something, don't just come out in a French maid costume saying that \"this is all I have to wear\". \n\nOh yeah, and don't godmod me to where I'm MAKING you wear the thing. If you wanna wear the stupid thing, do it, but don't keep on telling my considerate character how much you hate wearing it and when I say you can take it off be like,\"But then you'll make me do something else, I just know it!\"\nNo, I'm not. I'm really not.\n\nI remember that I was playing as a rich dragon hybrid guy with a tough exterior and soft insides, the usual.\n\nThe person I was playing with (who was also a male and identified as a male) said that the maids dress was all he had to wear apparently even though it was stated that my character let all of his staff live at his place so all they would really need to use money for is cars and food and clothes and stuff.\n\nSince he said this though, my character thought that taking him to buy him more clothes would be a good thing to do since I kind of ended up breathing fire on the guy, probably out of frustration, I can't remember.\nSo, my character says,\"Dress warm because we're flying\"\n\nThe guy literally comes out in 'booty shorts and a tank top' first of all, just call them short shorts, okay? Second of all, you are going to die if you wear that shit all the way in the air.\n\nMy character was like, dude, I told you to dress warm. And he's like, oh i'll be okay.\nAlright, whatever I guess. We go to the store and of course he goes to the girls section to try and be sexy I guess by looking at the lacy panties and whatever the fuck.\n\n My character is just waiting for him to pick out whatever and then some girls go up and flirt with the other character. I could tell that I was supposed to be jealous of this, but I wasn't because he seemed to be having fun with flirting with them.\n\nI think I eventually just ghosted them, but that's one example.",
