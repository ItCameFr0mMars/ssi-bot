            "selftext": "I was just in a group chat with three other people. We all say our greetings, but then after this one character said hi, OOC I might add, another person (Who I will call 12, because that's probably how old they were) replies by saying, and I quote,\n\n Oh, um...(character name)....hehe...\\*blushing\\* \n\n1. They were playing a very serious type character.\n2. This was still OOC\n3. They had not talked to the other person about pairing\n4. ??????????????????????????\n\nAnd so, I think that this is a joke. I respond by saying,\"How old are you lol\" I didn't want to seem rude but I was honestly curious. The other persons character said,\"My question exactly.\" and then 12 said,\"irl? not telling.\" \n\nYou're not telling because you're twelve, right? \n\nThis wasn't an age restricted rp or site so I was okay with that as long as they were a good writer. I would soon find out that their response was not joking at all. \n\nThe other person left very soon after and so did 12, probably because the other character left.\n\nLike, fifteen minutes pass and I see that one of my prompts had been answered. My prompt had been me as the character they had wanted to pair with that I never got around to deleting.\n\nMy character was a vampire and had to feed off of the other to survive, but it wasn't like a thrall thing, more of a favor to my character.\n\nI don't connect the dots that this is 12 until they start to respond in god awful ways.  I'm very empathetic to people who can't write very big chunks as long as it seems like they're actually trying. 12 didn't seem like one of these people.\n\nI started with 5 paragraphs, they replied with like, two or three simplistic sentences. They had at least not used asterisks this time.\n\nI respond accordingly for a while just to see how bad they actually are at rping. They seemed to only care about the characters being together, not bothering to act like their actual character. Their character immediately knew that mine was a vampire and said that I could feed on them. I do, and they admit their love very quickly after and my character is like,\"Fast, but okay\" and then I ask if they wanted to go on a date.\n\nThis is where the marbles get jumbled.\n\nAt first they said,\"Anywhere you want,love.\" Not my question, but okay. I'm typing a response when they edit it to say,\"Anywhere you want, love. The sun, holy water and garlic don't effect you by the way.\"\n\n...\n\nThen what.\n\n Is the point. \n\nOf being. \n\na Vampire?\n\nNot only was this godmodding, it ruined almost everything that could be fun in the rp. My prompt was about being a vampire, not your fast paced cutesy dating.\n\nI ended the chat right after without a word.\n\nEven when I first started rping, I never did anything to this extent. Maybe they should rp with cleverbot instead until they get older.",

            "selftext": "So, I was in an RP with this one community I usually do things in. Now I've been there for four years OOC and the RP I was participating in, a Warhammer 40,000-BASED RP (not a 40K RP explicitly because we allowed people more freedoms and to bring characters from other places), began roughly half of a year ago. The admins there came from another 40K based RP made by the same guy, but that died out after two years. This was a continuation I guess and I was new to this particular RP, so I came with maybe ten people from another RP on the site who knew the admins pretty well. \n\nThere was one admin in particular, and I'll call him S. S was known for being the \"Center of attention\" type dude who admitted he loved making Mary Sues and letting them take over the roleplays - He tried it with a faction in another RP I ran after this entire thing, too. I made a Space Marine from a custom Chapter that was derived from the White Scars (for those who don't know, Space Marines are the poster boys of mankind, and the White Scars/all descendants are generally antisocial in the lore IIRC). This was all when I was beginning to get into 40K, and so I made my character the last survivor of his Chapter so I could kill him off when I got more knowledge under my belt without having any big implications Chapter-wise. S made something entirely different, a female Space Marine who had been pretty much 18 years old, and just so happened to be a plant lady. Yes, you read that right. An Astartes made of plants. \n\nSo a few months go by and i decide to let my character try and remake his Chapter, as I was digging the RP premise and people were accumulating more power via factions, no real biggie. Everything takes place on one ship that's roughly 20% the size of Earth, so it's pretty big. What does S do to accumulate power on a place where people are teleported in daily from the Warp? \n\nHe decides to eat Slaneesh. \n\nSlaneesh, for those who don't follow up on 40K, is the Chaos God of Pleasure, Perfection and a bunch of other things that mark it as NSFW at times. S decided he wanted to unite a Chaos Marine faction and a few normal Space Marine factions, which means two groups that often try to kill each other based off religious beliefs, and usurp a Chaos God by eating them. The other admins don't think S would be bad enough to let it happen, so they just leave S to his devices. All but one admin, B. B calls out S on his craziness regularly, but nobody paid attention to him this time. \n\nSo I'm going through my usual day in the RP, doing as I usually do - Getting into plots and such with other characters. I decide to get into S' plot because he needs more people, and he takes us out of the ship via portals. Now, that's a bad thing because the DM of our RP explicitly made it clear that he wants us on the ship at all times for his plots to work. The DM is a pretty cool dude who's known on our site for making good plots, so everyone usually goes along with it. Except S, who can apparently get past all the miasma and lack of knowledge on the ship by opening portals to the Warp at will. \n\nS invades the Warp, goes right up to Slaneesh, and eats it. He lets Slaneesh go on some long rant about their powers, tries to snap it's fingers to desummon us, but apparently S found a way to strip it of its godly powers. S then uses magic to absorb Slaneesh's essence into his character, the Leaf Marine, and lets us all leave the Warp to be happy folk. \n\nThat's bad, because he just broke lore that had been in the works since 1977. Warhammer is older than people in my RP community and this guy just made his character the most powerful god in all the world, one who was quite literally fucked into existence by Elves. The admins are all flipping shit, but what does S manage to do? If you guessed \"Keep his OC and not care about the rules,\" then you're right. \n\nThat wasn't the last time we saw him, but thankfully he left sometime last year. He didn't do anything with the Leaf Marine after because he was on thin ice, but if he would've then someone surely would have demoted him for abusing his power, breaking (important) lore, and causing a shitstorm in the OOC chat for days afterwards. \n\nTL;DR: Mary Sue RPer makes a Leaf Marine in a 40K RP, eats a god, and doesn't care. \n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot to say: One of the most liked characters there was essentially a succubus who prayed to Slaneesh. The person RPing her handled the character well so it wasn't a trash-tier ERP excuse (she always timeskipped, thankfully), and S just tried to say that she prays to his character now. ",

            "selftext": "This is my first post on this sub, though I've been reading around here for a while and decided it would be a good of a time as any to throw my hat into the ring.  Before we begin, yes this is pertaining to World of Warcraft, however I'm not including names, realms, guilds, or character names.  This is fairly long, so apologies in advanced...\n\nI have a list of 3 short stories about my time as an RPer on the game, all having the common theme of all of these characters ICly being undead.  I'm an officer of a guild and thus have been involved with this particular community for a while.  We're a guild who, surprisingly, likes to have fun when we RP, and stay grounded in lore with a few bends here and there... with that out of the way let's get into the stories, in no particular order.\n\n**The Copypasta Within:**\n\nAdmittedly this story is rather tame compared to the rest, so this one might not be as lengthy.  We had a person play 2 characters often in our guild, both of which are ICly San'layn (*common theme for this story)* and were pretty active on the game in their spare time.  Well, this is no problem so far, until you realize that this person in particular was a MASSIVE fan of the Evil Within.  Now, inspiration is fine, I have no qualms, but this wasn't the case for this person.  One character in particular was an EXACT COPY of Leslie from the game, even going as far as to admit that... yeah, that's basically what this character was.  Often times we would have some RP going on in some place outside a major city, and this person would often times just... poof... meta their way to our location to RP.  Trust me when I say that it's no fun to have to constantly babysit Leslie when you're in the middle of discussing an assassination, a mission or what have you.  My character in particular was a hard ass about it, as he's a character who doesn't put up with bullshit.  Their second character... was merely a trouble making bitch.  I couldn't tell you what CHARACTER she was based off of, however she would often try to force \"experiments\" on people which made others pretty uncomfortable, especially when it was found out that this character experimented on children as well.  Also they tried to make a chemical weapon... I'll let you take a guess as to what they copy-pasted this chemical weapon from.  We had to punish the second toon several times ICly because of all the shady shit they've done.  OOCly this person failed to grasp the concept that actions have consequences, and would often time try to weasel their character out of a consequence the next day.  Each of these characters had some sort of mental disorder which isn't bad, but the way they represented those issues was done very poorly and was very disrespectful to the subject matter.  OOCly they were fairly nice, but would often complain that NOBODY is dropping what their doing to RP with them.  In the end, we let them down gently as we kicked them from the guild since it seemed that they weren't going to change.\n\n**Bloodlust:**\n\nBloodlust is the name I give to one person in particular who's character is now San'layn *(ugh)* though has became that way over time.  I was once very cool with this person, and would RP with them a shit ton when I first started out as an RPer in the game, and it was pretty cool starting out.  However, over time I found that there were some... glaring problems.  To start off with the minor fuckery, they owned... a lot of land.  They even went as far as to at one time, own ALL of Gilneas (on a different toon, who was also undead and had a copypasta Elfen Lied power).  They backed off of Gilneas at least, since a character of mine uses Greymane Manor as a placeholder for their house.  Moving on, they had a lot of OP characters, now this isn't a bad thing, as I have one too (who's gonna lose that power pretty soon).  However, you need to have flaws, which to be fair, their now San'layn character did, and you need to have a good reason for them to have said power.  Their reasons for their characters having the power they have?  Little to nothing.  Also those flaws mentioned pertain to the name of this segment, Bloodlust.  I've heard this term used so much by them and their group that the actual concept of bloodlust seems more like an afternoon activity rather than an actual affliction.  Even then, they'll have their characters go into this bloodlust fits, and refuse to have their characters accept ANY consequence for their actions, minus maybe like... one time after I had to scold them about it.  Not to mention that this person really seems to love violence, even in the case of peaceful characters.  Them and their wife taught a guy ICly how to be a monk, and lord knows if he said even one thing stupid, they would straight up crater him to the floor.  However, when this character's family member almost KILLS SOMEONE ICly?  She simply hides them away from any and all consequence and that's it.  It's funny too, because this person often complains about an over abundance of IC drama OOCly when they're most of the time the cause of it.  Their character now is San'layn, and to be honest it seems like they've given up a lot of what their character was, but that remains to be seen.\n\n**Hypocrite GM:**\n\nWe arrive at the final story of this, the cream of the crop.  This GM is not only a San'layn, but a BLOOD PRINCESS *(keep this in mind for later)*.  To not give too much away, their guild is comprised of undead, but some living.  Hell, they house Bloodlust and used to house Copypasta Within.  Generally speaking this guild keeps to themselves, which is fine, however OOCly and ICly this guild is filled with some of the most toxic drudge this side of the server has to offer *(that's not to say all of them, but most of them for sure)*.  This guild is notorious for starting a lot of IC drama with people, even without their consent, however god forbid that someone come to them about something minor, because they'll blacklist you to hell and back and claim you're a phobist, a sexist, or what else have you.  They dish, but most certainly cannot take, and are not too pleasent OOCly either.  All of these lovely bunches of people are led by Hypocrite GM.  Now, Hypocrite prides themself on knowing a lot of lore, and are VERY strict about lore when it comes to their guild and what they do.  Hell, they claimed they spent MONTHS writing their character...... how...?  I get that most people write slower than others, but months?  That's a problem if their character most certainly breaks lore after months of writing them.  To preface, they lambasted me about my lore and details behind my OP character mentioned earlier, who's void corrupted and has been possessed by a void lord once before.  However, they neglected to ask me for more details and instead just started to copy-paste definitions off of WoWpedia.  This person is very serious of their lore.  However, they're a huge hypocrite, since not only does their guild break lore all the time, but they themselves should not even exist as a character.  Why?  Because in WoW lore, all the blood princesses and princes have been killed *(yes, even the legion one)*.  Yet, this is the person who claims to be the shit when it comes to San'layn RP?  I don't see it.  He'll even accuse others, including me, of god modding when they themselves god mod.  They've been quoted to not like roll battling because it \"limits creativity.\"  What creativity?  The way that you'll creatively god mod your way out of any and all situations?  The situation is so bad with this guild that essentially every RP guild including mine has blacklisted them at this point, and to be honest Hypocrite probably still doesn't see the problem in the shit that their doing.  This is a community and as a GM you should be open and accepting of others, and not be so rude as to berate other people's RP styles and characters when you have flaws yourself.  They've even gone as far as to blacklist several years worth of story with someone in our guild without asking them OOCly, which is a scummy move.  The whole guild and their GM is a massive dumpster fire that's worth it's own individual story, but that's something I probably won't do unless that guild is completely gone.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed, sorry for how long this was and how rambly it got.  These stories are still fairly recent and prevalent so there's definitely some fire with the words I say.  Even with stories like these, WoW RP can be pretty fun, it's just bad apples like these that give good RPers a bad reputation.",
