            "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back again, very soon I know but I've still got some bad RPer stories under my belt, this one is again pertaining to World of Warcraft and this is back in my early days of WoW RP, specifically MG.  You are not prepared, fair reader...\n\nSo I was on my troll monk who was my main at the time, who I will refer to as McFly for no particular reason.  Well, McFly was getting drunk in front of the usual inn in Orgrimmar like he used to do, it was a pretty swell time until a particular other troll walked up and started hurling insults at him.  Now, McFly doesn't take crap so he hurls back some more insults.  Eventually me and my friend, who will go by Zombae, leave the place.  This person whispers me OOC and says I'm now blocked.... okay because my character wouldn't take your character's attitude ICly?  Makes sense....\n\nLittle would I know that this person would become the antagonist to this story, Slick.  Now, Slick comes back on another character who's only level two of all things.  Me Zombae have that suspicion it's her... well... an hour goes by and slick gives me some in game alcohol and apologizes for all the stuff earlier.  I try to be nice to people (lord knows it's bitten me in the ass many a time) and I forgive her for it... bad move McFly...\n\nFast forward a couple days and McFly and Slick get into an IC relationship, my first one mind you since I was new to WoW RP.  Now, here's the kicker, I was fresh out of a breakup when this happened.  No, I'm not here to get pity points, just prefacing.  Well... as IC relationships go, things happen, naughty bits occur.  They weren't the biggest deal, however she would push the envelope even though I told her fade to black before anything \\*cough\\* detailed happens.  Well... it carried on for only a week.... and then.....\n\nMcFly lost someone who was quite literally a son to him, a nightborne who I'll call Rambo.  Rambo was McFly's best friend, McFly rescued him from Suramar during Legion, and overall they were close.  He died and my character was pretty damn heartbroken.  What was Slick's solution...?  Get down and dirty with McFly, that'll make him feel a hell of a lot better!  I ghosted her completely after that, since it was then that I kinda snapped out of it and realized her TRUE intentions.  I was naive and I fell down the rabbit hole.\n\nThankfully, I climbed out of it since then and McFly and Zombae are now in an IC relationship and it's great!\n\nThe story doesn't end here, because she ended up running away from Moonguard and hopped to Wyrmrest Accord.  I heard this full story from both Zombae and my GM who I'll call Noot.  Noot and Zombae tell me that Slick broke up an entire guild because the GM ICly was poly and had multiple mates.  So... she got OOC jealous over an IC thing... sounds right.  This ended up leaving the GM to take a long break from WoW because of all the stress from this drama over the dumbest, most minute thing.  But, Slick is blocked by me and many others, here's hoping she never returns.\n\nTL;DR Crazy chick is obsessed with ERP and broke up a guild because of her own OOC jealousy.",

            "selftext": "Hello again friends. I know I just posted a few days ago, but I can't help myself but to share another story with you. This one isn't long, or full of Drama Llamas, it's just purely funny.\n\nOur story takes place just this past Monday. I was on Scooter, who just so you all know for context, is a half-elf cross-faction toon. Who is currently five months pregnant with twins. I just so happened to be on Alliance side, in Stormwind, on the server Moon Guard. I also just so happened to be at the top of the large slope leading from the Slaughtered Lamb inn to swoops down towards the Blue Recluse. \n\nScooter, being in the state she is, found herself waging war with her natural enemy, inclines. She'd just came up one from the other side of the clearing, and was now slowly going down this big one. Here is where Mr. K comes in. \n\nMr. K had been looking at Scooter since she came up the first hill and after a moment began to follow behind her. Nothing major, as I figured he was either trying to read her TRP still and wanted to keep her in sight for whatever reason, or heaven forbid someone on Alliance would be a decent person and was going to offer the struggle busing pregnant woman some help. I will let you know, dear readers, that the later is certainly not what happened.\n\n\"Woah, momma.\" He says to Scooter. Scooter stops as perhaps, as stated above, he's going to offer her help down this damned incline. Turning, Scooter sees a older human male in the laziest and worst king transmog I have ever seen on a max level toon. Beside him is an Alliance Page named Lionel. Oh boy...i already have bad vibes OOC and IC. However, my faith in humanity hasn't completely died yet at this point.\n\nBefore Scooter can even say a word, Mr. K once more speaks. \"Aren't you a prize.\" He says, causing me to cringe. Not the type of cringe you get when you curiously go to read Pornshire TRPs, but close. I would also like to point out that at this point, a group has formed around us. People just trying to pass but see that something odd is a foot. \n\nOnce more, Mr. K speaks before Scooter can even attempt a response. \"My son Lionel is looking for a mother. You look like you would do  nicely.\" Well, that explains the page..and what do you mean I look like I'll do nicely? Oh light, he must have a pregnancy fetish.. \n\nOne of our onlookers, a night elf on a horse speaks up. \"What in the fu-- did I just ride up on.\" By now Scooter has regained her senses. She slowly turns to look down the incline. Scooter proceeds to walk away.\n\n\"I'mma just go now..\" are the only words Scooter says during this whole thing, and as she disappears to go find refuge in the Blue Recluse she hears the crowd around Mr. K light a fire under him for being rejected by a complete random stranger. \n\nI don't get how Alliance side MG is so weird. Mostly just the human players I have noticed. It was funny though and I figured someone would get a hoot out of this. \n\nPeace out until next Story time with Scooter.",

            "selftext": "(Prepare, this will be a long one.)\n\nHi there, for my first post on this lovely subreddit, I'd like to regale you a tale of recent rp history on WoW. Yes, good old World of Warcraft. This is the story of an rp I witnessed/mildly took part in a few months back. My character is a half-elf priestess who we will call Scooter. Scooter was doing her usual and bee-bopping around a major city as is her usual to do when not leading her mercenary company guild.\n\nNow, I wouldn't say that Scooter is popular, but she knows a lot of folks through other people. One such person is her Death Knight pal, Bingo. And no, Bingo is not his real name-o. Bingo, who I am also friends with OOC, wants Scooter to meet his ex-wife. So thusly Wifey is piled into the list of our cast members for this.\n\nScooter and co. are right outside an inn when another friend joins us, who we will seem Rev. Again, I know this person OOC and they are a total sweetheart and keep ic and ooc separate. They also avoid drama. Remember this for later, it's important. Rev then tells her pals all about an elf who was rude and caused a scene that they refused to appologize for. Rev points this person out, who we will name Liar, and is the star of our story. \n\nLiar, for those of you who are curious, was a courtesan. This is where I would like to point out that our story takes place on Moon guard. So of -course- Liar's TRP profile lists the usual perfect body with ample breasts and bottom clothed in a super revealing dress that showed everything off. The usual ERP focused, but pg-13 type of special snowflake profile. Liar is also listed as being a total rude jerk and expects ic and ooc to have nothing but the respect befitting a goddess. You know...respect for being a prostitute for the courts.\n\nAnyways.\n\nLiar is approaching the inn followed by an undead gentleman. His name will be Dumass. Liar passes us and Scooter says hello, as Scooter is overly friendly. Liar looks to Dumass and proceeds to make a scene of those beneath her in status talking to her. Here is where I want to point out in Scooter' s profile it noticeably states she is the daughter to a merchant Lord. Since when was nobility beneath the prostitutes? So after showing she's a nasty type to people who don't and won't tolerate the behavior in character, Liar and Dumass go into the inn to plan out their ERP session in say. Real classy.\n\nBy this point Rev is livid. Not OOC mind you, her room is just a hot head. Wifey is also mad that an obvious street walker dissed her and her crew. Scooter and Bingo also make a few comments about the affair, because who wouldn't. Rev then goes into the inn to tell Liar off. Rev comes back out after doing so to hang out with the kids on the porch. Liar and Dumass then come out and with another rude tirade they go to the body of water near by. There were fighting words so of course Rev wnt to handle the situation. Scooter, Bingo, and Wifey go just in case things get out of hand.\n\nRemember how I pointed out several times we all took nothing out of character? Well. Liar and Dumass both made a huge fuss over Liar being called out on her IC actions and accused us all of being terrible people ooc and left for a nearby portal. No one on Scooter' s crew said anything ooc to either of these people. \n\nFast forward a few months to yesterday. I'm the GM of my guild, and one of my officers chimed in on Discord in our officer chat. His alias will be Captain Tendie, because his love of those things rivals mine to a wonderful degree. Cpt Tendie is a sweetheart and a real nice guy, so he was talking to someone who was explaining why they ran off server to WrA. They were claiming a certain Undead guild known for harassment ran them off.\n\nI'm the type of GM who tries to fight injustice when I can, so I ask for screenshots as proof to take to other gms to handle the constant issue. Guess who is was! Our friend Liar! Now can you guess what 'true' story she was telling my captain? The one I stated earlier, minus any of the facts and twisted to not only make her look like a total victim and all around good person IF and OOC, but also trying to blame a group not even involved. Rev did join the Undead guild eventually, but this was after the incident with Liar, and as far as I know Rev left once she found out how the GM runs things. She also made Captain feel like an idiot for falling for her sob story since he's a rad nice guy.\n\nSo let me remind everyone...remember who you to with and who you try to take advantage of because you will be found out, and your shame may be put on the internet in a not at all flattering light. With that, peace out my dudes until next story time!",
