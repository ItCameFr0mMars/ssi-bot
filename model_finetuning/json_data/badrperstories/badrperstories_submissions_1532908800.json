            "selftext": "Ahoy!\n\nInspired by a story here, I intended to start a Silent Hill-RP on a popular site for RPing. I'm one of those who would likely get a heart attack when playing a horror game alone, so I wanted to experience a cooperative adventure in the world of Silent Hill.\n\nAnd look at that, the initial thread did indeed spark a lot more interest than expected! So we got a few people together, even a DM to lead us, discussed the plot, set the group up and generally invested a lot of time into designing everything. We had decided for a story playing after the chronologically last entry of the series.\n\nSo it certainly would have been a start you can only dream of, right?\n\nOh god, why. :(\n\nYes, the easily most excited player who put a lot of effort into his character and the group fired up his detailed and long introduction post... vanished. Immediately. Only leaving a \"Okay, what to do now\"-post in the OoC-chat, our DM never responding at all and me being the only one to get the others to post. I also tried to spark some activity with my character to react to the others. We even had a new player coming in with her own introduction, just to vanish afterwards without a trace too.\n\nNow the group is literally silent for months, with my last post still being unanswered by others.\n\n  \nWhy on earth are you willing to go through the efforts to create a Silent Hill-playground for everyone which would have promised for a great story, only to ditch it in no time and not contributing anymore? It's baffling.\n\nSoooooo...\n\nIf you are interested in a Silent Hill-RP and willing to take an old farmer from Poland who can barely speak and understand English as he's just there for a visit currently, call me in.",

            "selftext": "You know, *that guy*, the one they mean when they say \"don't be *that guy*. That's what I feel I've become. And I want to bang my head against a wall having realised all the shit I've been doing.\n\n*I'm* the bad rper of this story.\n\nA lot of it wasn't even rp, just ooc chatter in between scenes. See, I have social anxiety that used to manifest even online. This led to some poor, annoying, or outright self-destructive behaviors like me apologising for everything, doing my best to be a people-pleaser to the point that I cared more about pleasing others than keeping myself happy, and not joining in on conversations because I was afraid that no one wanted to hear me anyways. Over time, with the help of therapy, I began coming out of my shell more, becoming more confident, talking more. I felt good about myself for once. Eventually, I grew confident enough that I decided that I would stop listening to the anxiety demons completely, at least while in the game, because I had seen that I could do it, and these people I was talking and rping with were my friends.\n\nGreat idea, right?\n\nAs it turns out, I accidentally also managed to kick the mechanism that was responsible for me not being a dick at times. My brain-mouth filter. Maybe I never developed a proper system for keeping myself in check because my anxiety was already doing a splendid job at that, maybe my anxiety *is* that system, just extremely overactive like an immune system reacting to irritants with an allergy.\n\n I have a talking allergy. I like that comparison.\n\nI ended up speaking my mind a lot more, even in places where the things in my mind were probably not appropriate. I got into arguments, and dumped some pretty controversial things, some of which I didn't even quite believe myself, but who can tell that on the internet? I allowed myself, for once to listen to my own feelings...and let them get out of hand.\n\nI ended up annoying and upsetting some people. I noticed that at least once, and apologised...and ended up doing more shit later. Oops.\n\nAnd then, recently, came the incident that made me realise just what a shit I've been. This one is actually rp related.\n\nSee, I have this character, let's call him Red. Red is something of an idealist progressive, but also has a reputation for being a loud dick to people who disagree with him - I based him off of a certain kind of Tumblr progressive; Means well, but the implementation turns people off, and doesn't actually entirely know the whole situation. One of the fun parts of playing him was watching him grow, and understand that the world is not so black and white, and being a shouty asshole doesn't work. This is all relevant to the issue, I promise.\n\nHere's how, actually. See, Red had a friend, let's call him Green. It was an odd friendship because even half a year game time before I introduced Red, Red would have never even considered being friends with someone like Green. But friends they did become, and it was all fine and dandy until Red learned that Green worked for a guy that Red saw as Literally Hitler (exaggeration, but Red was still in his Black And White worldview)  and denounced Green for it.\n\n\nFrom here on, \"Literally Hitler\" will be known as White, to keep with the colour theme.\n\nHere's another problem: When I started this thread, White was an NPC light years away from the setting of the game. Then someone decided to pick him up as a played character, and White's player did not appreciate the adamant animosity I was having Red throw at White.\n\nSo, what's the best course of action here? Would it be to, for the sake of rp and happyfuntimes to have Red ease up a little, maybe just ignore White and Green, or even reconcile his and Green's differences?\n\nSomebody explain that to my earlier self, please? Though I doubt earlier me would listen. Other players *had* try to imply and even ask me to tone it down. And for a while, I did. Kind of. I say Kind of because while I did eventually reduce Red's reaction to White's presence to glares and occasional grumbles, when White was not in the room, it was still the same ole story.\n\nAnd this is where Green comes back in.\n\nSince that faithful encounter where Red learned that Green was working for White, all of their encounters resulted with Red insulting and taunting Green. At one point, Red even took it so far that he almost got kicked out for being such a fucking dipshit. Now me, I enjoyed these. They always sent a thrill through me. I enjoyed them so much, in fact that I completely forgot to consider the feelings of Green's player, and others for that matter.\n\nAnd it all cumulated in this one recent event. \n\nDue to plot stuff, Red's world has been recently turned upside down and I took advantage of it to have him have something of a revelation and decide to change the way he does things. He even put out a piece in the local paper about realising that he was wrong to harass Green so. I discussed this with Green's player even, and we agreed to have Red and Green talk again afterwards.\n\nEveryone who knew about this ooc was expecting htem to talk. Green's player was expecting them to talk. *I* was expecting them to talk.\n\nSince I'm writing this, guess how that ended. You get three tries.\n\nHint: it was not with them talking.\n\nWe probably should have discussed this ooc before the scene, but, as they say, hindsight is 20/20. What really happened was that I ended up having to come up with a hook on the spot to get them talking beyond \"Hello, goodbye\" and I went to the topic of White. And Red ended up ranting again and accusing Green of being an asshole.\n\nBasically, the same song and dance that I've done over, and over, and over, in all those previous encounters.\n\nNow say it with me: I-D-I-O-T. That's me. I'm the idiot, to put it lightly.\n\nTo put it not lightly, I'm am inconsiderate asshole. Again.\n\nGreen's player had enough. They ended the scene early because they were uncomfortable. It took me a few attempts at post- rp chat to figure out that they were also quite upset. That's when it started to hit me, but by then it was too late. Later on, when I pmed them to appologise, they told me they were done with this thread - they'd had enough of it, and this song and dance of mine. Then the GM pmed me and told me under no uncertain terms to drop Red's deal with White *now*, because I'd gone too far with this. I repeated the same old tired routine for my own pleasure, with no concern that it was upsetting others.\n\nAnd so, this is the story of how I became *That Guy*. You know, the guy who doesn't consider others? Yeah, that's me. And I feel like a fucking shit for it. Of course, the damage is already done. I managed to upset people I considered friends, and no amount of apologies are going to undo it. Whatever my apologies are worth now anyways. Reminder: I've apologised before. Yet here I am. Somebody pass me the \"ASSHOLE\" hat. You know, like those DUNCE hats, but with ASSHOLE instead of dunce, cause I done fucked.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I want to make things right, but, it's like that exercise they have you do in elementary school about bullying where you crumple up the paper, and then uncrumple it and say sorry to it. The damage has been done, and no amount of sorries are going to uncrease it. All I can think of is to watch my tendencies more carefully from now on - hopefully for real this time. Maybe it's time to call back the demons of anxiety and ask them for a few pointers. Deals with demons never go well, but at least they kept me out of *this*  sort of shit. Honestly, I'd rather have to constantly remind myself that no, everyone does not hate me than have everyone actually hate me because I can't control myself.\n\n**TL;DR**: I went from anxious coward to overconfident asshole, and ended up upsetting people I consider friends, and only realised that I was the asshole afterwards.\n\n\n\n",
