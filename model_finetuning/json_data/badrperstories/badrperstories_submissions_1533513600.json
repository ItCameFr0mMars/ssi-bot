            "selftext": "A collection of TinyBads from various games and instances that I've seen recently--\n\n---\n\n**If the 3rd time isn't the charm, then...**\n\nThis is actually not one person, but a recurring instance. \n\nSomeone comes in and submits an incomplete character app. They're told that they need to finish components X, Y, and Z and are also given information that is relevant to what they already have to help them, and invited to ask questions and join the chat for help. They don't do either of those things.\n\nThen they resubmit a character app that still needs a fair amount of polish, but it's looking much better and is complete enough that it can be reviewed by the committee. They're told that they need to correct things A, B, and C.\n\nThe next resubmission comes with a frustrated note along the lines of, \"If it's not approved this time then I'm just done.\" And without fail, they haven't corrected those things or even made a good faith effort to try. A is done, B is part-way there, and C is flat-out ignored. \n\nAnd when it's invariably kicked back to them to fix, they whine and grouse about how it's not fair, they've submitted three times and should be approved by now. Well, if you submit an incomplete app the first time and ignore corrections the second time, it's not getting through chargen on the third submission. \n\n---\n\n**Sour Grapes**\n\nCoolKid used to play on our site and enjoyed a fairly successful career, working his character up to about mid-level with some good accomplishments. He achieved a minor position -- not an FC position by any means, and not one that had any activity requirements attached to it. \n\nCoolKid came back after about a year or so off and wanted to pick up his character. There was no reason for him to not get to play his character again, and upon a check of the database, his character was restored in full with all previously earned titles and rewards given to him. Again - no reason not to. \n\nEnter Sour Grapes. She's sour because her attempts to gain a similar position went awry because her character is constantly getting into IC trouble. She sees CoolKid show up and \"get\" this position and stews over it. And then she complains to the mods - \"I thought people don't get rewarded for inactivity?\" They don't. \"Well, I see that CoolKid just returned and he's being rewarded.\" With what exactly? \"He was just handed a position!\" Oh, no he wasn't, he earned that before. So cue more angst and whining from Sour Grapes, who wants that position too (they are, btw, by no means limited in number), and so on and so on. Somehow the reply that if she were to leave and return she could pick up her character just as well like CoolKid was not reassuring. \n\n---\n\n**I wanna be the** ***Main Character^(TM)***\n\nThat guy who tries to orchestrate a huge plot that involves blowing up something of vast significance by a bunch of NPCs. Why? Because those NPCs are hunting his character and they are *really dangerous*. You know they're really dangerous because they blew up this super important thing in a very secure location! Also, he's going to be the one to take down this *really dangerous* group that evaded people who are way stronger than him because he's the **Main Character^(TM)**. \n\nThere are many variants of this, but all seem to involve some sort of anime like plot with wanton destruction and an \"underdog hero\" that succeeds where the strong *cannot* for ~~plothole~~ reasons. Which leads us to our next TinyBad...\n\n---\n\n**But I need this!**\n\nThat Guy who needs all rules, common sense, and logic to be suspended for his character development. Bonus points if That Guy has roped a handful of others into what he described as a development RP only to suddenly start shot-calling and having a fit because \"Hey, your character needs to attack mine!\" \"But why though?\" \"Because *I need this* to happen for *my development!*\" \"But that makes no sense for my character to do!\" \"*sigh*\" \n\nThe participants quickly realize that they've been roped into a scripted RP with a predetermined outcome that That Guy never told them about, and That Guy is using this excuse of character development to act in a way that is considering godmodding by any reasonable standards. When the others point out that he's godmodding, OP, and they're not interested in behaving OOCly to suit his script, That Guy has a fit about how rude everyone on the RP is and bemoans how they've ruined his character now. Literally ruined!\n\n---\n\n**Everyone says, \"I will follow the group!\"**\n\nThis is a pet peeve that just ruins small group RPs and campaigns IMO. \n\nFour person scenario: \n\nPerson 1 has been trying to figure out how to proceed through a puzzle or other obstacle. But then the OOC and IC both stall out for a while.\n\nDM - What is everyone doing?\n\nPerson 2  - I'm waiting for everyone to figure out what we're doing. \n\nPerson 3 - I will follow the group in whatever they decide!\n\nPerson 4 - Me too! \n\nPerson 1 - ..........\n\nI mean, I get the appeal of playing a goofy/silly character. But come on, at least say something OOCly to help solve this problem...\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I am walking through Stormwind...Minding my own business, having a good day. I just got my druid the latest pvp set, and was pretty happy overall. But then I stumble onto a set of rp profiles belonging to a \"Draenei\" and an \"Elf\". After carefully inspecting them, it is clear they are both themed HEAVILY after Undertale. One calls herself the \"Fallen Child\" And has the nickname Frisk. The other is essentially the bare bones copy and paste character Sans, just with a few minor differences. The elf is...An amalgamation. She is a San'Layn (Vampire) Ren'dorei (Void Elf) Fel afflicted Nerubian Keeper. I approach both of them OOC and ask them about their characters...They both admit to them being heavily based on the characters form Undertale as I thought. They ask me to rp with them, and unfortunately I do rp with them both. I find it very cringe, as they are in a \"Fight\". I didn't understand as they were just moving around and not typing anything. Later I find out they are doing the rp over a call on Discord. Now I understand why some people wish to do that, but when other people are involved I feel everyone should know what is going on. Anyway, by the end of this I had a large distaste for Undertale. I used to love the series, but now....I don't even want to look or touch that game because I feel it was ruined for me entirely by some rpers on WoW.",
