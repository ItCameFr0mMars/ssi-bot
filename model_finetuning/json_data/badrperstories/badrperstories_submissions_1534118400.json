            "selftext": "I thought I\u2019d lucked out when I found a newly formed literate RWBY server. In the coming months before I finally left for good, I have wracked up quite a few noteworthy tales, none of which haven\u2019t been told countless times before. But while a Mary Sue/Marty Stew character isn\u2019t unheard of, the actions of the Admin (and the ghostly Mods) makes this particularly story stand out a bit. \n\nIntroducing: Martyeralius. Not the real character name, but just as made-up, long and impossible as it\u2019s inspiration. Martyeralius, AKA Martyr, was a 16 year old aspiring Hunter from Vale. Not only was he an undefeated champion, rich as all hell, scarred and tormented from a dark and unnecessary backstory (that changed multiple times) he was also the youngest and most advanced chemistry genius of our generation!! Oh, and he knew everything about mechanics too!! All evil villains were easily swatted away like flies, and any plot point was easily shot down by Martyrs incredibly inventive mind!! Which is pretty shitty when you\u2019re trying to push plots. When I tried to give some constructive criticism, letting the player know that it would be best to start small and allow your OC Room to grow into this special character, I was met with a lot of \u2018I can\u2019t do anything right :(\u2018 followed by an abrupt departure from the server. Admins were furious at me for having \u2018bullied him into leaving.\u2019 Confused and not wanting to deal with it, I apologize and he returns, but now he\u2019s posting a lot of passive aggressive and self deprecating stuff in every OOC channel available to him. Sigh. \n\nPushing plots was like pulling teeth for more reasons than just our little Martyr. I\u2019ll get to that some other time. This server was a mess of poor, and chaotically strict leadership. None of the server rules were enforced except for one: NO PUSHING PLOTS WITHOUT MOD OR ADMIN APPROVAL. \n\nFine, if they had a plot of their own I\u2019d understand. But after 2 months of waiting it became apparent that this was nothing more than a slice of life set inside the RWBYverse. Yawn. \n\nThen 3 months passed. A plot happens!! Finally, a villain enters the scene, and in the very first post after the treacherous introduction, our little Martyr thwarts the foe in two sentiences, giving no one a chance to actually battle. Okay....\n\nI go to OOC to protest the auto-hits, as well as point out that his semblance is not being used in the way it was supposed to, as per his own character sheet. It says in the rules that auto-hits were not allowed, and that all semblance\u2019s needed to be admin approved before being admitted. Martyr responds by going all \u2018woe is me, I can\u2019t do anything right, I might as well leave because everyone hates me\u2019 and promptly leaves the server, which offsets our teams AGAIN. This is in itself a huge flaw for all RWBY RPs, as it\u2019s hard to find 4 reliable people to stick with it and stay constant in their replies. \n\nOnce again, I\u2019m told to leave my complaints to the Admin or Mods (btw, these \u2018mods\u2019 haven\u2019t posted in 2 months at this point). I\u2019m once again lectured about not being an ass. He rejoins, all is right again. I\u2019m once again the target of every passive aggressive and self deprecating post in OOC. \n\nBut the tides are shifting, and every person in the server, besides the admin, is now catching wind to this BS. We all desperately, and separately try to talk to the admin about Martyr, and about our lack of plot. Everyone is met with the same response: Leave it to the mods. What mods??? \n\nAnyway, after 5 months I finally just give up and leave the server. I get a message in my inbox from the admin saying \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you talk to me if you were having problems?\u201d In one ear and out the other I guess. \n\n",

            "selftext": "So usually, with the vast majority of awesome players you write with, you get characters who can dislike each other IC and the players will still adore these characters and each other OOC.  \n\n\nOr in most cases of bad RP, you have character and rper with OOC/IC lines blurred, so characters will dislike another IC because of the player's OOC beef, or player will get salty OOC because of IC drama.  \n\n\nBut I think right now is the first time I've had someone play their character as cool with a character IC, and just throw massive amounts of passive aggressive shade and salt OOC.  \n\n\nCurrently threading a character with one from a newer player. Let's call this player 'What Even?' or 'WE' for short. WE is fairly new and has passive aggressively whined about not having much going on yet. (Never mind that at this point, WE has only approached the admins about threading or plotting.) So myself and another player offer several ideas and characters each with WE's onlt cirrent character. Each of these ideas gets hemmed and hawed at, especially since this character has not been played much yet so me and other player are going of WE's character's profile and certain aspects of his stated there, particularly flaws and dislikes listed since those can usually create an interesting basis for rp. Let's call this character... hm... Stuey. WE says, essentially, \"Yeah sure Stuey dislikes -x group of people in site lore-, but he doesn't show it.\" So you know, a flaw, prejudice, and dislike that doesn't *actually* affect him in any real way. Sorry, my mistake.  \n\n\nWE eventually just ignores the half a dozen offers given, and just opens up open threads. I'm still trying to give this new person the benefit of the doubt (even with several red flags already that have happened with WE's joining and character creation), so I try to tell myself, 'This isn't a slight against you. Maybe they just had ideas that didn't fit any of the characters or ideas offered to them.\" So I reply to the open thread with a character of mine who is related to the IC issues Stuey is mulling over and who is just a fun character who can make things interesting on his own. Let's call him 'Lucifer' for reasons that are apparent later. Lucifer teases and lightly messes with Stuey jokingly because that's how he is, and Stuey... doesn't really react overly much to it. And certainly not *negatively*. He never has negative thoughts IC even though his profile paints him as someone predisposed to being angry, hotheaded, and a bit judgmental.  \n\n\nOOC, though, in group chat, WE starts to make snarky comments about my character at every given opportunity. Makes insulting comments about him out of the blue, including calling him \"the devil\". When asked, lightheartedly, by me and another member to kind of, you know, elaborate on why he is what WE is saying he is and where it's coming from, WE just stays vague and repeats somewhat insulting things about Lucifer.  \n\n\nAnd really... I am just so confused? Like, I can be fine with you not liking the character. He's not me, after all. But even if I'm not a fan of the way other people's characters are written, I keep it to myself. And the weird, vaguely passive aggressive and insulting way WE is going about this make be me think they may have some issue with me personally. So really... what even?",
