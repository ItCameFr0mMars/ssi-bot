            "selftext": "So here I was on an ERP site, had a fairly long running elf character that people seemed to really enjoy. Heck, I really enjoyed playing the character. One fine night I meet an elf loving rogue who seemed to be pretty rad. We hit it off and played fairly well. Now, that doesn't sound too bad does it? Fast forward a month. I have taken a long break from roleplaying and have done some workshopping to improve my writing. Same dude contacts me again, I'll call him Rover. He immediately opens up with some unsolicited IC nastiness. I react fairly negatively to this, but we sooth it over and manage to get on with the day. He continually bugs me and I tell him I don't like his style anymore and don't want to play with him anymore. He didn't take the hint at all, I finally blocked him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that must be the end of it right? He did some weird stuff and tried to force an RP on me so I blocked him. Wrong. He contacted me via the sites equivalent of email, which for whatever reason wasn't included in my blocking of him. I decided to give him another chance. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. He immediately links me to a piece of art. This absolute nutjob commissioned a piece of art for my character unbeknownst to me. Amid his continual attempts at forced IC stuff neither I or my character would reasonably consent to. I tried to RP with him again but I got a poot of a two liner in response to my two paragraphs. Needless to say, I was incredibly let down by the quality of the post. I flatly told him I didn't like it and didn't want to continue. For the next couple days he would lament this and blame me for it. Saying that he thought I'd be a better friend cause he commissioned an art piece for me. I will be clear, I never asked for this art. I commission my own pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would continually accost my character in public rooms, to which people thankfully came to my defense OOC and IC. Finally after a particularly bad row with him and multiple other people in a room I moderated for, I blocked him fully and banned him from the room. It was awful and I don't know why I let it go on so long. Maybe part of me felt sympathy for his wretched begging for RP. But man, I couldn't lower my standards that far to indulge him. Especially not with the constant harassment. ",

The rp is going alright, not perfect but good. A few days later, he starts making weird innuendos and asking me creepy questions about my body. This puts me off obviously. He then confesses that he wants me as his girlfriend and that I must be so sexy irl. What the hell?? I tell him that I'm not interested (stupid reply) and stopped talking to him after.

            "selftext": "Ahoi again, fellow mariners!\n\nWhile reading through the posts here again just for the fun of it, I remembered one particular individual at a forum ages ago, which \"type\" doesn't seem to be featured here.\n\nSaid forum was a private one which had a long standing and tradition, being based on Nintendo, which was created to offer a place for those who came from the old \"Nintendo of Europe\"-community-boards. So basically, that community was old af and lasted, what, 14 years?  \nApart from its problems, like way too many mods and ran by an \"Bitch in sheep's clothing\"-admin (A sweetheart on the outside, but a ruthless, devious dictator, who also used the staff-restricted area to make disparaging remarks about some users, behind the scenes), I still considered it some kind of home, as I had met many people there who I considered friends for many years. Basically, we were like a big, happy family.\n\nIt also had a strong RP-section, where I had the honour to be in charge of. Until an argument with the aforementioned admin got me fired (I wasn't entirely innocent in this, mind you), who also was the leader of a tightly knit RP-clique that had no interest in interacting with outsiders. She's an own topic I could rant on, but I digress.\n\nTo make it short: we threw the worlds of Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda together, didn't give a damn about logic and lore and proceeded to have epic adventures while putting those settings through a shitfest of demons, foreign invasions, time-travel-shenanigans, and whatnot. It was absolutely retarded. But wonderfully so.  \nWe - a friend of mine and myself - also introduced Star Fox as a separate RP later, this time as something more serious with rules, a money-system based on posting and a shop with items you could buy with that money. Vehicles, guns, you know the drill. Unfortunately, that was at a time where the activity was almost non-existant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Incoming N!***\n\nFor little immature noobs, we were... quite advanced regarding to the rules, I guess. At least we had the standard-stuff like \"No OP-characters\". Both the friend and me also handled character-applications.\n\nN, however, immediately posted his app and started playing right away without waiting for approval first.  \nWell...  \nIt was your usual crazy, demonic, dark, black, brooding, whateverbadassshit boink bonk edgelord with multiple personalities turned up to eleven. Not to mention that he liked killing innocent people simply for teh lulz.   \nI'm not remembering much, but we went immediately \"bish, hell no!\" at the sheer bullshittery and Gary Stu-ness. His dude even came with a completely overpowered ship to boot, that was pretty much invincible and could take on entire fleets, as far as I know.\n\n  \nOf course we tried to confront him about this nonsense and denied his app. N's response (paraphrased)?\n\n***\"You know, you are overdoing things with all those rules! Roleplays should be free, where everyone can do what he wants!\"***\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know what happened after that. But if those scraps of memory are true and not just imagination, then we still stood by our decision and he stopped participating after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSooo... yeah, that's it.\n\nThe leetle baby men-tale of the player who thought that ignoring rules is perfectly fine since Roleplays are apparently sandpits where everyone should do what he wants.  \nYeah, I agree.  \nBut why won't you just go to a true \"Sandbox\"-RP instead of rolling over others who have rules for a reason? I'm sure those exist as well for your liking.",
