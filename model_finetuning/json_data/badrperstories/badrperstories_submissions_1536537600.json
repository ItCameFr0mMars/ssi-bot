So when I saw an ad for an all-boys school with homosexual hijinks, I was expecting a cute, slice of life thing where the boys grow to understand themselves and each, fall in love, panic about not being \"normal,\" and stuff like that. I wasn't expecting the very first RP of the entire game to have a teacher drop trow in the middle of class, and every one of his students fights over who gets to play with the hose first. I, uh, left the scene immediately and dropped out of the game.\n\nIt's just, I don't remember the ad saying this was a mature game? And it said homosexual not homoerotic. So maybe someone else could see the red flag, but not me. It just really put me off RPing outside my tiny circle again.",

            "selftext": "I only recently got back to rping after taking a long hiatus. Recently, I started rping an oc of mine that I recently created in several rps and looking back, I am cringing at some of the decisions I\u2019ve made when writing him so far. \n\nLike even his character is really cliche sounding: He\u2019s supposed to be a professional potion brewer in the Victorian era and because of his profession (they are supposed to be seen as odd or strange for their work, despite being needed) and silent demeanor he is treated as an outsider by others although in nature he can be quite kind. He does tend to be very organized because of his given profession and always has a neat and groomed appearance. He is quite focused as well as well read in his work and enjoys studying into it and discovering more about the unknown. Because people in the Victorian era were expected to be really formal and act to social expectations, I thought it would be cool if he took pleasure in finding out and learning more about things that most people back then-even now, would consider bizarre or just not normal. Despite this, he genuinely does not mean any harm to anyone in his work, and has deeply regretted incidents in which it has happened in rps. \n\nAnother problem is I feel like I haven\u2019t had the right situations where I could have him display traits that were crucial in demonstrating what kind of person he is. In the incidents in which I could\u2019ve, though, i feel like I failed to use them. Like, I could\u2019ve added more detail about his thought process and why he does what he does or given him better dialogue, but no. :( As a result, he either comes off as too extroverted in situations or literally has no personality at all and sounds like I\u2019m writing an edge lord at times due to his descriptions of not being able to properly blend into society.\n\nProblem is that I\u2019m too afraid to ask anyone I\u2019m rping with for criticism because I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s proper and I\u2019m honestly afraid that no one says anything because they don\u2019t want to sound rude.

            "selftext": "So besides the **need** to ship everything another thing boaty did which looking back on it made absolutely no sense was when she broke the universe rules on what is allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for anyone who's heard of the series RWBY that is where all this stuff happened,granted it was very early in the series's life,but something's had already been established. Mainly the races humans,faunus and android....none of which included angels or demons...yeah boaty was one of those people as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this stuff came from out of nowhere,but in hindsight i should've probably noticed sooner.See it all started with one of boaty's characters an average doctor type,who also just happened to have 'wings' which i didn't think much of cause i thought it was a faunus trait...nope the character was human,but still had wings because reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway this led into boaty's **need** to have this character shipped with one of the canon characters,this wasn't the first instance of it,but oooh boy did it get ridiculous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point a demon appeared and here's the kicker this average doctor type was some total badass who was allegedly the only one able to stop it cause he was holy,but this was just one demon....there was still 6 more,yep Boaty was making demons for the 7 deadly sins.Oh and on top of being the only one who could stop them,the character also got holy armor for every one defeated and scars reflecting how they were killed...and as all this was happening apparently the character they were shipped with was pregnant with said holy warrior's kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd at no point did they **EVER** do anything sexual nor was there a 9 month period of pregnancy,no this kid was just a damn miracle baby apparently,oh and yeah the kid literally appeared out of freaking nowhere....because screw every logic in the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway this whole war with the 7 demons thing played it's course and boaty told me that it was gonna end with their character being killed as they killed the last demon,but to be honest i really didn't care it had no place in the stuff i was trying to do,but of course i had to drop what i wanted to do just for boaty cause if i tried anything it would get high jacked by them or derailed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after however long the whole demon thing happened,surprise,surprise boaty's character is still alive with everyone of my characters having no idea what happened and it apparently not being important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo,no,no,no,no you just high jack what's happening for however long and then brush off my characters and me when i want to know what the hell happened,but of course it doesn't matter and what does is that the miracle baby gets shipped cause apparently he came into being as a young teenager and boaty expects me to just create a character out of thin air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah that led into the previous issue i had with boaty and for anyone who's curious,yes i made the character,but they never got shipped with the character boaty wanted because said character's brother didn't like them,nor did i,but that led to a whole other issue i had with boaty,but i'll save it for a separate post.",

This is in reference to some issues I had with 1x1 partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI RPed for years on Gaia Online \\[I didn't know better\\] and while I did enjoy it, for the MOST part, there are some partners there that are ... different. Five different examples. No wonder the site lost 90% of its user base in a few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) Partner demanded me to call off from my job so I could send posts out. I used to RP strictly over AIM when I first started with Gaia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) Was probably on drugs. No joke. She asked me if I'd be fine with playing a young/older dynamic. Nothing that would cause Chris Hansen to kick my door down but you know, just by a few years. Then she messages me saying \"I never asked that.\" I had no words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) Partner kept misspelling my character's name. The characters name was Lucian but she spelled it as Lucien. Not a BIG deal but I decided to just send a quick OOC message correcting her and she went on this rant about grammar nazis. What. Keep in mind, I'm always friendly when it comes to OOC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.) Someone kept harassing me for posts. I typically tell my partners I post a few times a week at a minimum but this person didn't get that. I told her that I was busy and IRL things happened, so I gave her a heads up but she still didn't get the hint. She sent me passive aggressive PM's until I ended up just blocking her because I got tired of dealing with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.) Similar to number 4 but if I didn't respond immediately she'd just re-send her previous PM. I work full time in healthcare so sometimes I have to stay over to ensure coverage, so you know, patients aren't waiting for delayed lab results and compromised health care. I once worked a long shift and I found her re-sending her PM not once, not twice but four times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",
