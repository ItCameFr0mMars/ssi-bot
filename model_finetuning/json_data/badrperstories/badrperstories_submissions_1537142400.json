            "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time submitter, hello! I'm here to bring you all a story of a character I've encountered a few times on my adventures in roleplay, and his efforts to woo my main oc, Crane. We'll call this guy Dandy, for now.\n\nFor brief context, all of these encounters happened on the same site- A chat site that caters to both fandoms and ocs, with a separate tag for group chats, where you can roleplay in a group- And that's where I've always encountered our friend Dandy. He's chased me out of a chat or two, but let's save that for later...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lemme tell you alllll about my trauma, baby. (Content Warning for CSA mention)**\n\nMy first encounter with Dandy happened in a fandom-centric chat, with Duck adjusted thusly- It's a semi-unique setting, but I will say that vampires are canon to the setting. What isn't canon? Incubi.\n\nGuess what Dandy was?\n\nI guess it's partly the mods faults- They were never very confrontational or eager to exercise their mod power. Regardless, Dandy was a super sexy incubus rockstar who had a tragic past and got all the ladies, and I guess he assumed he'd also get Crane, even though they only ever interacted... Once. Let's go over that interaction.\n\nCrane was running with a group of people who were trying to make their way to Moscow, because that's where the main villain of the arc was hiding out at the time, and the aforementioned group of people were currently hiding out in Kazan after an attack by one of the big bad's lackies left one of them incapacitated. So, Crane was terribly on-edge, and buying some chocolate from a corner store, and really not in the mood for anything too invasive.\n\nCue Dandy pinning her to the wall with one arm and using a pickup line.\n\nNow, Crane is very uncomfortable with treatment like that, and she told him to get off her, in no uncertain terms, she was also very visibly uncomfortable. Dandy didn't pick up on it and proceeded to ask her to this 'nice little outdoor cafe he knew' despite them being in Russia in the dead of winter. Crane didn't have any of it, and told him to get off of her again. Dandy ignored her yet again, and told her a pretty girl like her should be treated well. So, Crane finally pushed him off.\n\nAnd *then*, Dandy started to bawl his eyes out and accused her of seeing him as damaged goods because his father sexually abused him. No, I am not making this up.\n\nFor brief context, Crane is a CSA survivor, and these two are total strangers. I don't know where the fuck this came from, but I was desperate to salvage the interaction, and had Crane abruptly peace out back to the hospital to warn the group about the crazy person who just harassed her. I confronted Dandy's mun about the interaction, and they apologized before leaving. That was the last time I saw Dandy there, before...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Forget your investigation, date me!**\n\nI met Dandy's mun again in another chat a year later, and once again they asked for Dandy to interact with Crane. I needed a bit of reminding to remember who they were, but surprisingly, I accepted. Mostly because hey, it was a year ago. It couldn't be too bad, right? ...Right? (Spoilers it was still pretty bad)\n\nThe setting, this time, was a mystery sort of thing- Everyone's characters got knocked out and spirited away to a secluded location and were sent out to figure out how and why. Now, Crane has a lot of obligations in her life (work, a sister, a pet, etc), so she was freaking out a little and trying to investigate why she suddenly woke up in this new place with help from another person, a male character that we'll call Sun, for now.\n\nWhile Sun and Crane were gathering their bearings and making a plan of action, Dandy strolled up and asked Crane to get something to eat with him, completely ignoring Sun in the process. I sighed audibly, and had Crane turn him down before asking him where they were. Dandy said he didn't know, threw in the fact that he's evidently a world famous metal musician, and then asked Crane if she'd like to see him play. Sun jumps in to tell him to fuck off, and Crane echos the sentiment, causing Dandy to leave in a huff. Sounds better than last time? Well, it kinda was. Except... Dandy's mun kept making passive aggressive remarks ooc about Crane and Sun's interaction. Mods told him to knock it off, he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't seen Dandy since the second encounter, and honestly, I'm kinda 'eh' about seeing him again. He's never treated me, out of character, poorly, and I have stories about people who are... Worse than him. But, another story for another day.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I've been lurking for a bit, and wanting to talk about this, but just never really found the motivation until now. I was gonna go deep and detailed into this, giving the people involved nicknames to keep them anonymous and all that, but I've decided I should just keep it more simple and sweet, but not short. I won't deny me and my friends were in fact part of the problem most of the time, but in retrospect we were hardly ever the source of the problem.\n\nThe main villains of this tale will simply be called... Bonnie and Clyde, because I'm not a creative person, and I don't wanna be too on the nose with whatever nicknames I give them. Bonnie is Clyde's fiance, and, to put this in tabletop terms, was the embodiment of basically every DM's Girlfriend story, while Clyde is your typical Controlling DM.\n\nHowever, this was not tabletop, it was on Discord, and we roleplayed Pokemon. I joined when the RP had just finished up its second arc and started on its tournament arc. Things were fine then, it was very fun-focused and very shounen anime style if that makes sense; Pokemon getting cool powers because why not, hell even including \"Stands,\" although in this RP they were more like the games' Z-moves on steroids. \n\nA lot of people were still newcomers to the RPing scene, so yeah, there was plenty of early installment weirdness to be had. Problem was... Clyde, who owned the server, was very passionate about writing, which wouldn't be a problem at all if he hadn't pushed this standard on everyone else, and the fact he owned the server gave him an excuse to be a bit of a control freak. \n\nRegardless, things were still pretty alright, until one roleplayer had to leave for basic training. Then it started spiraling downhill when Bonnie was promoted to being an admin, and she and Clyde used this authority to put bullshit \"rules\" in place that disallowed people to do things they personally did not like, such as people having joke RPs of sorts in the OOC, and disallowing any discussion at all of the Pokemon RP me and my friends made. The worst rule of them, though, was the rule that basically said you couldn't criticize the admins, and if you tried to criticize them and they asked you to stop, you would be temporarily banned from the RP if you continued instead of stopping.\n\nSo... people criticized that rule, and of course didn't like being told to stop, so some people did get temp-banned from the RP. After that one roleplayer came back from basic, now with admin authority, he did manage to convince Bonnie and Clyde that the \"rules\" were dumb, so they were (mostly) repealed. The one about no RPing even as a joke whatsoever in the OOC remained, though we did find a compromise to this in making another channel for non-canon RP.\n\nBut oh no, it didn't stop there! Boy did I wish it did, but it didn't. See, Bonnie was now writing her own arc based on a movie she liked. That's fine, we all took inspiration from various things we liked. Thing is, this arc had a lot of problems, and the thing about that is that she and Clyde were on a high horse about being good writers, and Bonnie in particular had a big problem in which she felt her own mental health issues trumped everyone else's... these things didn't mix well when she was running an arc.\n\nYou couldn't criticize anything about the arc without her going into a \"Everyone hates me and nobody cares about my opinions ever\" tantrum and then leaving the server. This was her general attitude towards any criticism directed at her, mind you, but seeing as she was the arcrunner, this made it hard to do anything in the arc as she was simply hard to work with. And again, since she and Clyde were on a high horse of sorts when it comes to their writing, and Bonnie in particular was an extreme perfectionist, it was her way or the highway during that arc.\n\nThe arc was supposed to be \"serious,\" and this is why Bonnie and Clyde got on to one of the roleplayers for the fact his character was \"too funny\" for this \"serious\" arc, which would be somewhat reasonable... if not for the fact one of the main plot scenes in this arc was a skeleton character assisting the main villains in attacking the Pope. Yeah, you know, referencing \"Why I Gave The Pope Undertale,\" in a \"serious\" arc. This is okay, but a character being hammy and comedic isn't?\n\nAnd then it just... lagged, for so long, and everyone was blamed but the arcrunner, who had the brilliant idea to keep tacking on as many bosses and mini-bosses as she could. Of course no one felt motivated to continue in this arc when it had dozens of bosses versus previous arcs' like, ten max. Of course no one felt motivated when, just when the arc would seem close fo finishing, here comes Bonnie, adding some new mini-bosses and bosses so her arc based on the 2017 Mummy and the Dark Universe reboot could be cram-packed with every type of monster ever. People were fine with just vampires and Dracula, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster and his bride, a giant spider, the invisible man, and of course, the mummy. But literally no one asked for kelpies, no one asked for gargoyles, no one asked for a yeti, no one asked for a Tsareena with the brain of a Primeape, no one asked for... the list just goes on and on!\n\nOnce this arc was FINALLY over, and even then this was because it was forcefully ended and its final fight was subjugated to only being told via flashback, things were still looking bad. Bonnie continued on with her usual \"only my mental health is important\" shit. People kept telling her to seek help, but she insisted on continuing to throw fits about how people never bothered to message her every time she.... left the server.... and set her status to \"Do Not Disturb.....\" things that.... indicate a person wants to be left alone.... yeah, she was very much a \"You have to fight for my friendship and if you don't then you're the actual bad person\" type. \n\nWhen one person was finally done with the emotional baggage, he politely told her that yes, he cared for her well being, however he did not have the energy to provide her with support she needed. This is reasonable, because none of us were therapists and we had our own issues to deal with, we can't constantly give someone help that a professional could. Well of course, Bonnie didn't like this, and popped back at him with a \"Oh, so you don't want to help me when I'm FUCKING SUICIDAL?!\" Keep in mind this woman was nearing her 30s and she is saying this to a 15 year old.\n\nClyde... enabled this behavior, is the worst part,  and once the 15 year old had left the RP for good is when everything took a turn for the worse. Clyde in particular just loved talking about how much he hated this teenage boy, and keep in mind Clyde is a grownass man. He didn't care at all when Bonnie directly admitted she tried to manipulate this teenager--again a grownass woman admitting she purposefully tried to manipulate a teen--and in fact just blamed the teen for it all. He took every opportunity to bash the teen and his characters that he could get. This also made the teen's best friend (who is the aforementioned roleplayer who was told he had to play his character seriously) incredibly depressed.\n\nAnd it just... honestly I don't even need to explain it in full detail, it just kept going downhill from there. The teen was not the first person to leave, as the aforementioned military RPer left too, and eventually me and the teen's best friend left, and another guy left. And who did Clyde blame? Not himself, not Bonnie. He claimed the infighting happened because the RP was \"wrestled away from its creator,\" which hey, isn't totally wrong, as he did wrestle the RP away from the girl who actually started it. Sure, it started in him and his friend's server, but at the end of the day, this girl is the one who started the RP. It would not exist if not for her.\n\nSo, what drove me to finally leave? Well, between the time Military RPer left and I did, Bonnie and Clyde just got worse and worse about their biggest problem; a sense of entitlement. Keep in mind that Teen Boy RPer left because Bonnie was pestering him about doing ship scenes between their characters that got into a romantic relationship, threatening to drop her character in the relationship if this request wasn't fulfilled. But she didn't stop there, she also had a ship with Founding RPer (the aforementioned girl who started the RP), and used the same tactic on her. Bonnie straight up had her character suffer amnesia in a way where she forgot about the other character existing. She also continued to threaten to end the ship if Founding RPer didn't cave in to her demands.\n\nThis ended up contributing to the breaking point that made me leave every RP I was in. When I found out Bonnie was digging at Founding RPer's insecurities and using her threats of ending their ship as a manipulative tool, I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nAs for Clyde... he just could never remember the Golden Rule of RP; all characters are supporting characters, do not try to be the main character. This caused him to try and retcon other people's writing to go in with his, and when they disagreed, he'd say they weren't being \"lore-friendly,\" even though the lore in an RP should be written by EVERYONE as a community. The night I left, he ALSO harassed Founding RPer over the same thing Bonnie did; an edit. Yeah, a recolor of a Pokemon made Bonnie leave the server and cry about how her feelings \"didn't matter,\" and Clyde continued to call the edit ugly and say that since the character the edit was made for was in a relationship with one of his characters, that he had the authority to tell Founding RPer not to use it. Yeah. He was THAT entitled.\n\nAnd after I left because of this bullshit with the edit, Teen Boy RPer's best friend, who I'll call Swedish RPer, followed. I talked to him about it and it turns out that yeah, one of my stupid actions (which I'll elaborate on in a separate post wherein the story is about me being a bad RPer), however his biggest reason for leaving was something that had been there for a while; Teen Boy RPer leaving really hit him hard. But also, he was tired of drama and especially Bonnie's shit. In retrospect he also realized he was tired of how limiting Clyde was. Of course though, Bonnie and Clyde twisted this into being Swedish RPer's only reason for leaving being because of me, and therefore they blamed me for something that was mostly on them. Then another guy--who I'll call Chef RPer--left for similar reasons.\n\nHow the hell did it take me over a year to realize that an RP run by a control freak and his equally entitled fiance was a toxic RPing space to be in? Why didn't I leave sooner? Honestly I'll chalk it up to just being me feeling like it was an obligation to stay, especially since Bonnie and Clyde acted like dicks the minute people left the server for any reason (unless it was Bonnie leaving the server in a fit). I also genuinely enjoyed what I did with everyone else in the group, and at times I did enjoy what I did with Bonnie and Clyde! But in retrospect I realized neither of these entitled, arrogant people make good company in an RP.\n\nAnd now I'll finish this off with a list of minor details:\n\n- Bonnie and Clyde being genuinely fatphobic. Like, I hardly ever use that term, but with them wanting to make a separate gijinka channel just because Bonnie didn't like how some of our gijinkas were chubby... yeah.\n- That time Clyde completely unironically spouted the phrase \"RP before life.\"\n- After I left, Clyde called me white trash and Bonnie said she wanted to strangle me (yay for threats of physical violence!).\n- After Teen Boy RPer left, Clyde decided to butcher any of Teen Boy's characters that he personally hated.\n- After I left, Bonnie said she was going to have one of my characters die (even though I said to ask me first) and once again made a comment about physically harming me, saying she'd slap me if I said it wasn't okay to kill this character.\n- After Swedish RPer left, he decided to give a canon explanation to ending a love triangle his character was in with Founding RPer and Clyde's characters by saying his character chose neither one. This made Clyde write an obvious spiteful fic that completely betrayed what Swedish RPer actually wanted for the end of his arc, wherein Clyde's character, who is the brother of Swedish RPer's character in the triangle, daterapes Clyde's character in the triangle and impregnates her in the process.\n- Bonnie and Clyde liked using my boyfriend as a middle man of sorts and causing him a great deal of stress by basically forcing him to choose either me or them.\n- Bonnie abusing her admin powers to delete a channel... then immediately getting her admin powers back after having been punished for less than 24 hours.\n- Clyde insisting that it would be bad writing and that he wouldn't take part in an arc if a past villain were held hostage so the main characters could use his information against the main villains of the arc, because a scientist who operated on people against their will didn't deserve a \"redemption arc\" (even though this wouldn't be a redemption arc at all)... yet tried to deflect when we brought up how his serial killer character got a redemption arc, and how actual Nazis--one of which was a scientist who performed even on children against their will--got redemption arcs.\n- Clyde having dwarves that were actually called dwarves not because they were short but because their size dwarfed everyone else in comparison..... while also having giants as a separate species from dwarves even though they were fundamentally the same.\n- My boyfriend, who was working at Amazon and therefore underwent unfair treatment at work, was venting his frustrations about it, only for Bonnie to pop in and tell him \"At least if you quit YOUR job you have a house you can go back to.\" Again, she liked to pretend only her problems mattered.\n- Founding RPer literally getting banned from an RP Bonnie made because Founding RPer.... was accidentally lore-unfriendly. \n- Clyde wanting to turn the RP into a novel... so he steals people's characters and gives them different names so it won't TECHNICALLY be plagiarism. I only put this in minor details because I actually did manage to work this out with him (my problem was only that he didn't ask me), but it still irks me this happened at all.\n- And so much more, but we'd be here all day if I listed all of them.\n\nSo, yeah, sorry this was so long, but that's about the gist of it. I'm proud to say I've cut them out of my lives for months now and my life has improved tremendously since then, and I'm in better RPs now.\n\nTL;DR - Engaged couple with entitlement issues make RPing hard due to their control freak and perfectionist tendencies. One stoops as low as manipulating a teenager when she's a grownass woman, the other feels like he alone owns the RP, and both enable each other. Most people leave because they obviously couldn't handle it. I'm still baffled it took me over a year to leave. The moral story is that RPs run by manipulative, entitled, arrogant people are very toxic communities to be in and you should escape ASAP if you see these kinds of things starting to happen.",

            "selftext": "I got a message from someone a couple days ago wanting to RP. We get talking, start a bit of worldbuilding, there's a couple of bits of miscommunication here and there but nothing worth getting upset about. I roleplay with others to have fun, and I enjoy when I get along well with the other person OOC. Didn't quite feel a connection with this person, so I [drop a quick message to let her know I'm not feeling it](https://i.imgur.com/Pl3rIpU.png). I've only ever had to leave a couple of people this way and they've taken it in their stride and wished me well as they left, so her taken it this way kinda caught me off guard.\n\nI try to remain polite and apologetic. Maybe she thought we were getting along fine, this took her by surprise, and she doesn't know how to react, that's fine. [Then I get told I'm a liar](https://i.imgur.com/10Nib96.png). I had asked her questions regarding her worldbuilding to prompt her creativity, but her worldbuilding wasn't the problem. I didn't want it go down this way, but I sent her a screenshot of me asking questions to prove myself right, to which she quickly dropped that argument. She then goes on to try and leave the conversation, and without blocking me, my responses reappear in her DM list. I'm now accused of [\"standing over her\"](https://i.imgur.com/EHAvaSZ.png).\n\nThroughout the entirety of this, it felt like she was trying to pick a fight with me, when I only tried to end the conversation as politely and kindly as I could. I didn't appreciate being called a liar and refusing to let her leave the DM, which made no sense at all. I've had a few bad RP experiences, and this is another of them.\n\nIn the future, is there anything I could do to handle this better and stop things from escalating like they did?",
