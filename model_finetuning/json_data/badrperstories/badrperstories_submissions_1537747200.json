            "selftext": "Hi everyone! So basically, I first tried roleplay when I was around 15 years old with a friend and her online buddy. They'd said they would do a short rp with me to let me see what it was like, but when I tried role-playing with them they just godmodded everything and none of their actions made sense. So it wasn't a great introduction. \n\nAfter that I did eventually start a proper 1x1 rp with a mutual friend of ours and it went quite well and I really liked it, but we wrote ourselves into a hole and ended up abandoning the rp. \n\nSo now about four years have past and I'm wanting to give it another shot. I have never tried forum roleplays before and I haven't written anything that isn't an essay in years, so I know my creative writing isn't very good. I'm just hoping some of you guys can point me in the right direction as an almost total beginner. \n\nI'm worried about joining an rp when I'm not good at writing, and creating characters is another thing I struggle with. They're always super cliche. \n\nThis post is getting a bit long so I'll leave it there. TL;DR: Haven't roleplayed or wrote a story in four years, not sure where to start. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

            "selftext": "So regarding last post,  I messaged her OOC and we seemed to work something out which is good! She offered up her ideas and we agreed on a new idea. However, she seems to have it all preplanned for how she wants it to go and puts a lot of empathesis on her own oc, while nearly forgetting that my own oc is even there at all. She also is mentioning her character getting stripped a lot... what. And she seems to expect my character to come in and rescue her again, even after I wrote a scene with him being beaten to the ground with someone currently threatening him with a gun. Although I would hate to, it's actually getting to a point where I'm considering stopping rping with her because of this. ",
