Whether you\u2019re judging another player on the style of which they write, or the things they like to write about - just stop. If you have a specific group, for example advanced literate and someone who\u2019s semi-lit applies, don\u2019t berate them. Tell them kindly why it wouldn\u2019t be a good fit. You don\u2019t like cliches, but Jane does? Leave her alone. You\u2019re not better than her because of it, you\u2019re just different from her. \n\nI\u2019m sick of powergamers and metagamers who\u2019re in complete denial. Check yourselves. You\u2019re literally ruining the game for others just so you can feel like the star. You know how mad and huffy you get if your character is ever one-upped? Why would you constantly do that to your peers? Do you lack basic empathy or self-awareness? No really, I\u2019m asking, what\u2019s your fuckin\u2019 problem..\n\nI\u2019m sick of seeing players pushing eachother down instead of lifting eachother up. This is a community, we should be helping eachother. Helping eachother grow and learn and explore new things and new places. Encouraging eachother to step outside of our comfort zones and try things in roleplays you never thought you\u2019d try. Always a shy, small and quiet female character? Try to be a big bold man! You shouldn\u2019t feel judged or discouraged from wanting to stray from what you\u2019re used too. \n\nAnd mostly, I\u2019m angry because I\u2019ve lost my motivation to write creatively. Between this, and that.. I have been beaten down into a writers block that feels endless. I\u2019m sick of dead end plays. I\u2019m sick of scenes being ruined by powergamers. I\u2019m sick of being the nice group leader and making sure my members are satiated before I satiate myself. I\u2019m sick of getting excited for or about new roleplays only to have them crumble. I hate having to always be the person to come up with stuff. I hate having to carry a story. Im saddened by the lack of creativity. And so much more.. \n\nThat\u2019s my rant :) thanks for the soapbox hehe",

            "selftext": "So I want to know if anyone has advice on how I should deal with a certain situation. I've got a friend who offered to solo-GM something for me. Which considering it's a lot of work, I was super grateful for. At first it sounded promising- he was kinda new to some of the details of the setting we were planning to use but insisted he was a fan and knew enough about it to run.\n\nBut right away, we hit two problems. One: this setting (40k) requires- even if you're going to ignore a lot of the general tone that most of it carries- a certain feel for some of the factions to be true to the lore. And he clearly didn't read any of that, or read it and decided not to use it. Which would be fine, but that feel is a large chunk of what I'm after and I said so. Whatever, maybe I could work around that. It wouldn't be GREAT, but it's something.\n \nBut this GM also has this huge, massive, overarching universe he's been working on for years and years and loves to drop into things. It isn't actually compatible with the setting the new game is supposed to be in, but he's shoving it in any way and it's really clearly bolted on and even contradicts some of the laws of the canon universe.\n\nI'm all for going off book, but this game is meant to be played with a certain 'feel' (at least, how I've always seen it played.) Am I being unreasonable? What should I do?",

            "selftext": "After my horrible history of Forum RP (Detailed in many, many posts here) I moved to using Reddit as a way to find RP partners. This was done through a few specific, RP-oriented subs that I found semi-useful. Unfortunately, while the environment might have changed, my luck didn't.\n\nI met a partner whom I'll call **MS**. Looking at his post history it seemed like we wanted similar things out of RP and that we had similar styles and the like. We exchanged PMs and then went forward with planning and starting a RP. The idea was that we would be using Discord for planning, OOC chat and general hanging out, and then email for the actual game posts. So far so good.\n\nThe early posts were great, and were done at a fast pace. The pair of us also spent a lot of time chatting OOCly on Discord, and things seemed good. After a while, however, MS's post rate began to slow, while they were on Discord less and less. Or, alternatively, I'd see them on there and send them a quick hello message, but they would not reply or try to engage with me.\n\nAfter a bit over two months of RP (Which is a lifetime by mys standards) things slowed to a crawl. I hadn't gotten a new post from MS in over a week, and while yes, I had been busy with RL stuff, I was now over the hump and looking to get back into it. I sent a \"hello\" message to MS over Discord, only to find that they had changed their account to only allow messages from friends... and I was not one of those.\n\nI sent him an OOC email with the details of what had happened. He explained that he had removed me from his friendlist because I was not on Discord often and thus had assumed that I was no longer interested in the RP. Never mind that I had made the last IC post and was waiting on him. He had expected that I would constantly be on Discord to chat with him, again never mind that he'd largely been absent and unresponsive.\n\nI explained that I had wanted to continue the RP and had been waiting on him. His reply was to say that because I had not been around, he'd dropped the RP all together. However, at no stage had he attempted to contact me and ask where I was, or why I wasn't on Discord or anything else.\n\nIn short, I didn't acknowledge the problem because he gave me no indication that there was a problem to begin with. And because of that, he dumped the RP and blamed me for it ending.\n",

            "selftext": "So last time in the story of Del's Disastrous DM'ing... a lot happened. [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/9mhdb8/adventures_in_awful_rp_long_a_saga_of_stupid/) I capped off that story by saying that- although the overarching \"Saga\" of this guy is done, there's a lot of isolated incidents from over the years that warrant their own spinoff stories. And that's what this is here.\n\n\nRemember Red The Rogue? Elf-girl who Del decided should be given some... \"enhancements\"? Well as I earlier alluded to, this wasn't Red's first rodeo. I initially created her for a *different* Fantasy game before that one. Which also fell apart (I'll give you a moment to catch your breath after that *shocking surprise.*)\n\n--\n\nSo once again, sit down, grab a drink, get cozy, we're gonna dive deep into the (brief...) life and inevitable death of Red the Rogue at the hands of Del the Dumbass. \n\n\n**I: Flights of ~~Fantasy~~ Failure;**\n\nYou'll recall how all this started, way back when, right? A quick refresher, Space-Cap'n Jim wanted to run a space adventure, only for Del to hijack the game out from under him. Well brace yourself for a surprise... history repeats itself. \n\nAnother friend of mine, who doesn't mind being named, /u/Kisukisutoasterfckr/ (No, really...) we'll call them Toasty for short. Anyways Toasty wanted a break from the Sci-fi stuff for reasons we can dig into another time. And wanted to create a Fantasy game, largely based on Warhammer Fantasy- *before* Age of Sigmar took a sledgehammer to the setting I mean. Not a whole lot you need to know about this setting, it's rife with the usual stuff. Magic, dark gods, pirates, Orcs, goblins, spooky scary skeleton armies, etc. \n\nProblem is Toasty- like Jim before him, was a player first and a DM second. In the years since Toasty's come into their own as a DM, but back then? Not so much. So they made the mistake of letting Del worm their way into the power structure as a \"support\" DM, initially just for getting forum threads created and filled out, but... yeah, within a week or two Del was hijacking the place, changing the lore, inserting stuff that clashed with the tone of the setting, etc... this was the last time we let him do this by the way, from here on we made sure that anyone wanting to create their own settings did so in their own, *seperate* forum where he couldn't slither in and disrupt things. \n\nBut the point is, the setting was- once again, fucked. \n\n--\n\n**II: Nom Nom Nom;**\n\nRed was actually *not* the first character I created for this game. The first character I created was an... experiment. I was big into Warhammer alright, but Warhammer 40k. (Y'know, the one in space.) So with Toasty's approval, I used one of that game's species, tailoring them for Fantasy use. For anyone curious, it was a Kroot, sort of bird-lizard guys for whom the phrase \"you are what you eat\" is more true than most, as they assimilate and replicate the genetic traits of their prey.\n\nWe'll call him Chompy.\n\n\nSo the \"gimmick\" was that Chompy was a Ranger/Alchemist sort of hybrid. He'd tag along on any mercenary jobs or expeditions that might involve dangerous or exotic opponents, his \"payment\" coming in the form of getting first dibs on the corpse of whatever they kill, harvesting useful flesh, bone, organs, what have you. I never went into explicitly gorey detail with this, merely *implying* things. \n\n--\n\nSimple core loop, kill a thing, harvest the bits, and keep 'em. Anything specific or interesting, he could bottle and use later for a random mutation, but you're never 100% sure what it does. Sometimes it'd help out and give him some sort of massive power-up (albeit temporary) sometimes it'd backfire and he'd have to spend a few minutes vomitting up something he ate that reeeeally shouldn't have been eaten... this was my way of avoiding accusations of \"god-modding\", because I absolutely understand that random powerups on a whim would be super disruptive to the flow of gameplay. There had to be a risk/reward factor. \n\n\nWhat does this have to do with Red...? Well, keep reading, we'll get there.\n\n--\n\n**III: Guild Wars;**\n\nThe Guild System was something Toasty had been toying with before the game went live. The idea was as simple as you're imagining. Different players want different things, some of them want to go monster-hunting, some want to go looting treasure, some want to be Paladins, etc, so each \"Guild\" would have its own story arc that you could join into. You just had to tag what \"guild\" you wanted to be a part of on your character sheet. \n\nI remember at first there were around... 4 guilds. \n\n* The Hunters' Lodge- which was where Chompy wanted to go. For obvious reasons. Monster-Hunting abounds. \n\n* The Knights' Keep, which was your basic Do-Gooder Paladin / Knight / Cleric place. Help the downtrodden, feel good about yourselves, etc.\n\n* The Magos' Tower, arcane nonsense, crazy folk, big hats. Lot of plane-walking quasi-dimensional stuff. \n\n* The Mercenary Camp, which was the \"Miscelanious\" area. Anyone who wants a job that doesn't really match any of the above.\n\n--\n\nHere was the issue though... These were just the four Guilds that Toasty had come up with, and written a decent chunk of lore for each. Then... inevitably, Del happened. Del started writing *more* Guilds, which only served to fracture the playerbase even more. A Four-Way split was manageable, we'd have four seperate stories running where there'd be occasional overlap (like characters from 2 guilds' wanting the same thing, so they'd briefly interact, clear a dungeon together, split the loot then go back to their respective stories.)\n\n\nBut no... Del had to go and be Del. I think he wrote 3 guilds, which now meant *Seven* active stories. Naturally, this didn't work. *At all.*\n\nSo two of Del's guilds had to be written off immediately, I don't remember what those were, that's how... vague and bland they were. But the 3rd one, he kept... it was basically the *Edgelord* guild. Thieves, Assassins, you get the idea. \n\n--\n\n**IV: Guild Wars 2; The Guildening**\n\nWhen the forums were set up, everyone posted character bio's after reading the guilds' lore and what they had to offer, writing up character sheets, motivations and so on based on which of the four (Now five, thanks to Del..) prospective stories caught their interests. \n\nPredictably, we ended up in the exact situation I *said* would happen before the forums even went up. One or two guilds ended up overpopulated with characters (The Hunters and Knights' to be precise) while the other guilds were *vastly* underpopulated, to the point of only having one or two characters each. I don't think anyone ever joined the Edgelord guild to be honest... Del wrote a fuckload of backup characters and NPC's for that group, pestering people into joining it, but the way he wrote this guild, it was painfully tone-deaf and seemed more like your typical \"chaotic evil\" group than anything anyone would want to be a part of. For reasons we'll get into later...\n\n--\n\nSo how do we resolve this? The stories can't really progress if there's a wonky imbalance among the guild populations. You had the Hunters' guild with about 5 or 6 characters (including Chompy), the Knights' guild with 4 or 5, the Magos with... I think 2..? And the Mercs with another 3. \n\nMy suggestion was \"why don't we consolidate guilds for the first story arc?\" Sure, there was the bones of a story in place for each, but there was nothing stopping any overlap. Like... say, have the underpopulated Magos group and the overpopulated Knights group work together on something, to balance things out. \n\n--\n\nDel; unsurprisingly... did the derpest thing possible. Rather than consolidate the overpopulated guilds with the *underpopulated* guilds, he did the literal opposite of that. And suddenly we had the Knights guild working with the *Hunters'* Guild to investigate something. And the Magos working with the Mercs... \n\nWhich meant we had one *gigantic* party of 10-12 player characters, and one tiny party of 5... rather than a more even split.\n\n\nToasty managed the smaller group, since it was the story he'd personally planned out and written for the Magos, while Del.. being Del, assumed responsibility for the larger clusterfuck of a team. Toasty was still inexperienced as a DM, and while he was slightly suspicious of Del at this point, our bullshit radars weren't quite as fine-tuned as they are now, so Del was able to easily manipulate things so that he ended up in charge of this campaign too. But we didn't realise he'd done this until much later on when he started hijacking story arcs on a whim. \n\n--\n\n**V: All For None And None For All;**\n\nWhen Del mashed together the Hunting party and the Knight Party, it was not a *well balanced* union. The story was that the Knights wanted to investigate some kidnappings by a local gang of marauders, and needed to bring in some hired muscle. *Like, I dunno, the fuckin' Mercenary guild?* But no, for whatever batshit reason, he wanted the Hunters. \n\nI think I know why he did this, even if it sounds a little... self-centered? I think it was *because* of me. I only had one character at that time, I dimly recall having another character, but... man the memory escapes me. Point is, my main character in all this was Chompy. And Chompy was in the Hunters' Guild. So Del basically scrapped the Hunters' Guild story just so he could have his boring knight characters interact with me. \n\n--\n\nThis went as poorly as you're imagining. The Hunter players were getting antsy about not getting to kill anything interesting, as dealing with generic thugs and Orcs isn't what they signed up for. Chompy especially.\n\nWhile the other Hunters were being paid, his payment comes in getting his pound of flesh (quite literally in fact). The backstory for this was that Chompy's clan back home are on the verge of being wiped out in territorial wars with other factions, and he ventured out here to find fresh game and better sources of mutation that might give them the edge they need for long term survival. \n\nSo every day wasted chasing some boring Paladin work rather than an actual creature worth hunting was a day he wasn't getting back. And he's getting less and less personable as this goes on, despite Del's attempts at \"flirting\" with him with some wretchedly irritating rat girl *Yes, another fucking Rat person. Jesus, I kid you not.*\n\n--\n\nI made it clear that (A) Chompy's not interested. Age wise, he was over 200, and it showed, he was around the late 60's mark physically and personality wise, whereas Rattities here was a teenager. I was not interested in-character, or out-of. (B) Chompy actually doesn't *have* junk to use in that regard, he's a friggin' lizard. So Del backed off a little, but not much. \n\n\nWhen the Knight and Hunter group finally made it to the \"endpoint\" of their story, they were faced with a castle of mooks and a... Fire-Giant. What? This was not explained by the way, and seemed to go against the lore that had been set up before this. The random band of raider thugs had access to a spellcaster to summon this fire-giant in a setting where Magic was heavily policed and scrutinised, they had the means to summon it, and the willingness to do so, simply to protect some random girl they'd kidnapped. \n\n--\n\n**VI: Hunger Pains;**\n\nThe Knights leapt into action, but at this point the Hunters were bored as all hell and just wanted this done with. Bearing in mind this is was a text-based RP without any official \"mechanics\", the fight was difficult. It took like, 2 days of posts at regular intervals to finally kill this damn thing, and the cherry on top, the part that made me just *give up* on Chompy as a character?\n\n--\n\nDel described the 'death' of the Fire-Giant, that it \"collapsed into ash and disintegrated\". Meaning not a single ounce of salvageable material for Chompy to use. Meanwhile the Knights rescue their damn prisoner, who was a mary-sue as fuck orphan girl Del had written, whose existence would be \"integral to the larger plot\", yadda yadda yadda, *I don't fucking care* at this point. Chompy sulks back to the guild hall, checks the bounty board for anything actually *interesting,* and leaves, because he's had enough of this and it's plainly obvious to anyone with half a brain.  \n\nTo clarify; this isn't me throwing my toys out of the Pram for not getting a sweet loot drop. This is me recognising this person has failed as a DM. They have neglected to accomodate my character's skillset, goals and motivation into the story. They have failed to engage with me and get me invested in these events, and ultimately did nothing to warrant this character staying around. So it's not out-of-character for him to leave.\n\n--\n\nOh, by the way? Chompy didn't get to leave right away. I was told I had to stick around for a day or two in-universe while they \"sorted out the paperwork.\" During which point, he again tried to push Ratgirl onto Chompy, and he rejected these advances. And then there was another hard-as-balls boss fight- which now that Chompy had wandered off on his own, I had to solo... \n\nAnd the kicker? It was a fucking *spectral* enemy! A *ghost!* Meaning yet again, no fleshy bits for Chompy to salvage. *Are you fucking kidding me?!* This was your last chance to *maybe* throw him a bone (figurative or literal) and you *utterly* miss the mark so obliviously it's actually kind of impressive.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, at this point, I am *far, FAR past done* with this crap, ditch the character and start fresh. I retired the character and haven't used him since. Which is where we get to Red. \n\n--\n\n**VII: Enter Red;**\n\nI briefly alluded to Red's backstory and personality in the previous post. But suffice to say, she's nothing all too special. The long and short is if you Rule 63'd the Hugh Jackman character from that early 2000's *Van Helsing* movie, but made 'em an angry redhead elf-babe with a fondness for knives. The sort of character who nine times out of ten would be the character who belongs to the bad RP'er in this kinda story. But this is the 1 time in 10 where that's not the case. *(At least, I hope not, for the sake of my poor fragile ego...)*\n--\n\nRed's backstory wasn't anything to write home about. Grew up in a city filled with the grim and gritty fantasy monsters that nobody wants to deal with. Werewolves, Vampires, Undead, all that good spooky shit. Didn't so much become a vigilante so much as having *inherited* the job from her mother, the human half of her half-elf ness, who'd been fighting the good fight well into her old age, raising Red to be her successor and assume the thankless job of stemming the tide of plague, rot and misery once she'd kicked the bucket. Red did not come from a happy place, in case it wasn't painfully obvious.\n\n--\n\nFor reasons that are not important to this story, Red's mother ended up cursed something awful (the handiwork of a dangerous arcane adversary the mom-and-daughter duo tangled with), prompting Red to leave their shithole of a city and venture out to parts unknown to find a cure for this problem. She found one, but procuring it ate a deep hole in her pockets, leaving Red in a mountain of debt that couldn't easily be wiped away. So reluctantly, Red put the beast-killing and vampire slaying gig behind her for a time, taking on mercenary jobs to try and earn the coin to get out of debt.\n\n\n\nI'd written this up in such a way that she could end up in basically *any* guild, therefore any adventuring party so long as the end result was profit. I'd learned the hard way via Chompy that wanting a specific character motivation taken into account was apparently asking *far* too much... so \"I want cash\" is a fairly broad motivator that is easily pandered to.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n--\n\n**VIII: Here's What Went Wrong;**\n\nTake a guess which guild she was *ordered* into joining, with no choice on my part. Go on, guess.\n\n--\n\nIf you guessed \"The Edgelord Assassins' Guild\", congrats, pat yourself on the back, because that's the correct answer, unfortunately....\n\nNow Red isn't exactly \"lawful good\" by any stretch. But even for the coin to get out of debt, joining up with a bunch of wholesale murderers isn't exactly what I had in mind for the character. But whatever, I'll go with it. I'm told the reason for this is because \"The guild is underpopulated\", and this might spark interest for other players to make characters for it. Which I understand, on paper. \n\n--\n\nExcept \"underpopulated\" was a *gross* understatement. Aside of Del's characters he made specifically to act as story hooks for the guild, *nobody* was in this group. It was empty. Which means Del had *once again* tried to box one of my characters off from everyone else for his own 'enjoyment' (ugh...) \n\nI was told that someone else would be joining, but apparently in the *first encounter* Del's edgy assassins had with this other RP'er, they put a knife to his throat and threatened to murder him just for... being there...? When he was literally just minding his own business. And then Del got all irritated when this understandably annoyed person *didn't* want to join the gang of murder-wierdos, so that quickly fell apart. \n\n--\n\nAt this point I already wanted out of this, as there were *other* people in the forum I wanted to use this character with. I'd barely written a single post and already wanted to leave, and it was all downhill from there, if you can believe it. \n\n--\n\n**IX: Brain-Dead Stupidity;\n\n--\n\nSo what did this guild of Knifey goths actually do? Well, the answer is \"not a lot.\" Upon entry I was given the typical clich\u00e9 introduction to any seedy dive. People are drinking, smoking, gambling, trying to get laid, bragging about things they've done or will do, etc. Red goes to the bar to get a drink, and is promptly asked if she's beeen \"initiated\" yet. \n\nAsking what that means, someone *casually* explains that in order to join the guild, you have to be... *an Undead.* No, really... none of the patrons or other guild members showed any signs of necrosis, so I ask Out-of-Character if there's any illusion magic at work or something altering perceptions to make them look more human, or if it's a \"Pirates of the Carribbean\" situation where they only look corpsey in moonlight or whatever.\n\n\nDel tells me, \"Nope,\" just \"they're undead but look normal\". \n\n--\n\nAt this point, I had many questions. Such as...\n\n* How do you get drunk if you're undead? Booze doesn't *magically* enduce entoxication, it's the body's *reaction* to that stimulus, if you're a literal corpse, you wouldn't have a working digestive system, so wouldn't anything you consume just... sit in your stomach, not going anywhere?\n\n* How are others smoking and enjoying that? Same question, kind of requires working lungs, but I digress. \n\n* How are people *fucking?* I don't even want to know about that one, but that one... requires a pulse and bloodflow, for obvious reasons.\n\n--\n\nI end up having to explain these *basic human anatomy* things to him, including the fact that an *Assassins' Guild* made up entirely of undead is fucking stupid. As outside of healing magic- which generally does more harm to undead than good, how does anyone survive even a single mission? When you're a corpse, bruises don't heal, bones don't get un-broken, torn skin can't be patched up without making you into a Frankenstein's monster lookalike. \n\n--\n\nDel dismisses these criticisms by handwaving it with \"The ritual that resurrects them as undead lets them retain their bodily functions.\"\n\n... then they're not undead. They're just *Edgy Elves.* Because literally the only difference in his mind between an \"undead\" and a regular mortal was \"undead don't age\", that's it. No necrosis, no drawbacks, nothing. \n\nI explain to him, growing very irate at this point... that's called Vampirism, you dummy. If you want the whole thing where you don't age, but also stay somewhat normal, what you want is a vampire. Again, he ignores this. Insists \"They're undead.\" \n\n--\n\nRed refuses this \"initiation\", she says she's here to earn coin, not join a cult. And she's more than willing to test the limits of their \"undead-ness\" should anyone insist otherwise. After introductions to some thoroughly annoying and utterly forgettable NPC's, Red gets her first task. One of the guild's longer standing members apparently went to speak with a Noble who lives nearby at their manor, and then didn't come back. Red has been told to sneak in, find out what happened, and if possible, recover a certain document the missing NPC had on their person at the time. Simple enough. \n\n--\n\n**X: Red Dead Irredeemable;**\n\n--\n\nRed is given a rather bothersome *sidekick* for this mission, a character Del still uses to this day, who we'll unimaginatively call Green. If it wasn't obvious, Green is a Goblin. One of his *I-can't-believe-it's-not-corpsey!* kinds of *\"Undead\"*. Who, in the continuing trend of Del being fucking wierd, she tried to get into Red's pants. I *wholeheartedly* rejected those advances, because ew, what the *fuck.* I don't think anyone in their right mind wants to bang a necrophilic midget.\n\nThe next evening, the break-in occurs. Red takes a rooftop route and carefully plans their way in and out. As part of her backstory, I'd made it known that she fights \"smart\" rather than fair, and is an adept at constructing improvised traps and lethal implements of various kinds. Nothing too high tech, crude explosives and fragmentation devices, smoke bombs, the sort of stuff that doesn't deal a lot of *damage* but will still fuck you up in some way or other, typical thief-y dirty tricks. \n\n--\n\nShe's travelling light, not a whole lot of armour, prioritising the sneaky method, and actually *not* wanting to go in guns blazing. Red spends a few minutes watching the inner courtyard of this manor from a high but shadowy vantage point, mapping the guard patrol routes, watching their body language, trying to get a sense of which one might be \"persuaded\" to part with the information she's here for. \n\nRed eventually identifies the right candidate, and slips down. She waits for the right moment, the change in the patrol shift where one guard has just come on duty, and their replacement is leaving to go check somewhere else. She comes up behind this guard, and slips a blade to his unarmoured neck. She's got him dead to rights, if he calls out, she'll slice open the jugular. Red quietly explains in a vaguely threatening tone that she's got no interest in killing him, and he's got no interest in dying, so it'd be better for everyone if he just tells her what she needs to know, so she can leave without making a mess. \n\nNaturally, he tells her everything and then some. Red now knows the location of the document and how to get there. \n\n--\n\nAt this point, Green shows up. ... don't ask me how, her arrival was *never explained,* she's just there now. Being a frickin' *Goblin* I assume she crawled in through a cat-flap or something, because there's no way her stumpy ass would be able to take the acrobatic parkour route that Red took. Green asks about the missing NPC, at which point the Guard says that the NPC in question betrayed the Assassin's guild and sold them out. \n\nGreen promptly loses her shit. \n\nNow let me stress this- Del is controlling the Guard *and* Green, he is writing both of their lines of dialogue in the same text post. Everything I've just described, and am about to describe, was written solely by him. He constructed this scene. *Keep that in mind.*\n\nDel describes Green reaching over her shoulder and hefting some disproportionately huge *gun.* Some kind of steampunk looking portable cannon like instrument. Guns aren't a thing in this setting, I believe Del even said \"no guns\" as a hard rule in the character creation thread. But of course his Goblin has one, \"because Goblin\".\n\nIn the same post, before I can get a word in, Green aims the weapon at the Guard's stomach, and pulls the trigger. Del describes in detail exactly how much damage this weapon did, and the \"smoking hole through both front and back\" of this guard that was left after the shot. \n\n--\n\nI stared at that post for a good twenty minutes, just... aghast. No.. he didn't. Did he just... \n\n....okay then.\n\n--\n\nI hop on over to the OOC thread, and ask him to *clarify.* Did the shot fully penetrate?\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"As in, it went in through the Guard's armour on the front, and came out the other side?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n--\n\nRed, if you were paying attention, was standing *behind* the aforementioned guard. Not at a distance, no, as in, her front pressed firmly against his back. The idea was that if she did need to slice his throat, she could *catch* his inert corpse before it hit the ground, rather than letting it fall. \n\nSo, my turn to reply.\n\nI describe Red collapsing backwards with a massive gut-shot stomach wound, screaming in anger at this dumbass Goblin something akin to *\"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR, YOU HALF-BRAINED HALF-PINT?!?!\"* \n\nIn his complete obliviousness, Del had just *team-shot* my character, by failing to take into account that an object in motion *stays* in motion. If that shot fully penetrates, it's hitting the thing *behind* it too. Namely Red, who as earlier described, is *not* wearing armour. \n\nSo Red's toppled backwards clutching her gut, and that loud \"BANG\" and all the yelling have alerted *all the other guards.* \n\n--\n\nDel tries to go back and edit his old post to re-phrase it in a way that this doesn't happen, less apologetic and more *bruised ego,* in that he tried to cover up his mistake before anyone else could see it. But the Out-of-Character thread was still there where by his own admission, full shot penetration occured. \n\nI call him out on the post-editing, and he asks \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"Good question. I wasn't expecting to get shot in the gut by my own ally, so I'm as confused as you are.\" \n\n--\n\nHe didn't have a \"way out\". He'd made an ass of himself, and everyone knew it. I wasn't going to write a 3rd character, nor would I un-retire Chompy, so at this point I did the merciful thing and allowed Red to die rather than prolong her suffering. \n\nThe Fantasy RP thread soon died with her, as brazenly breaking his own \"no guns\" rule and killing someone's character with it put basically everyone off who hadn't left already.
