            "selftext": "The saga of Red has inspired me to share my own saga of horror forum RP. This particular scare takes place on a popular social site that was once popular for RPers, but over the years has become broken and borderline nonfunctional. In retrospect, I'm not sure if it was actually a decent place for RP in my golden years there, or if I was just naive to its nature. If the vocabulary in this post tips you off to where, **whoops, sorry not sorry**.\n\nMy most-used character on this site was a heavily AU version of a canon character in a reasonably popular fandom. Let's call her VampWitch. VampWitch is not the type any sane person would want to casually hang out with. She's grumpy, hoards trash of both the magical and mundane varieties, and while she's not a murderhobo by any means, her vampiric diet is an unpleasant elephant in the room for any company who happens to have blood flowing through their veins. Because this is apparently a recipe for wife material, several other players (muns) have tried to put a ring on it for reasons I cannot explain. I, being bright-eyed and bushy tailed, never had the heart to directly say no, back in the day. All were various shades of inauthentic, but none so catastrophically as this one.\n\nEnter Scythe. Scythe was a follower on my ask-the-characters page for a set cast, who sent in requests regularly from a blandly-described Marty Stu persona. So often, in fact, he ended up with something of an avatar I'd designed because I found it amusing to cameo my regulars (first mistake, giving him encouragement there, I know, I know).\n\nNaturally, when I announced my new RP page, he was among the first to follow. And among the first to hit up my shiny new muse with his own. Now, there's a big problem with this from the get-go, and a weird one at that.\n\nYou see, I'd done almost all the designing on his character based on the bare-bones traits he'd given me from time to time on the old page. So... some kind of butler? Sure, fits the setting. Emo hair? That's easy. Appears from a portal, breathes fire, has a death scythe? That's... even my bushy-eyed self knew that was cliched as fuck, but whatever, it was a lighthearted page and shenanigans happened. Trying to made sense of the OP-traits-thrown-at-me, I logic'd that it sounded like a Giratina's powerset, so Marty Stu became a Giratina gijinka by my hand. Scythe was all on-board with this, and I was so pleased to see my idea being adopted with such gusto that I drew a solo character portrait. Yeah, that was a pretty big red flag in retrospect, because I didn't consider _why_ Scythe was so enthusiastic.\n\nIt turned out Scythe had no ideas for his character most of the time beyond \\*does inane action* or occasionally \\*does needlessly violent thing* . VampWitch would give a passive reaction and not give whatever Marty Stu was up to much thought, but I did feel pressured to give at least a quip in reply in the interest of \"fairness\". Yeah, that was _really_ stupid. We live, we learn.\n\nIt eventually came to light that Marty Stu was the last survivor of his race, a fact that gave him great loneliness. VampWitch was sympathetic--she'd recently turned into a vampire at this point, and could relate to the loss of her former compatriots who now saw her not as a person but as a threat to be exterminated. So, they bonded a bit over that, and for a moment it seemed that Scythe was beginning to learn the push-and-pull of conventional roleplay. And then one day, Scythe messaged me saying he wanted to ship Marty Stu and VampWitch as lovers.\n\nVampWitch is a lesbian.\n\nVampWitch is not ambiguous about her sexuality in-universe. She hits on women regularly, and has never hit on a guy once. That said, I could forgive missing the writing on the wall when her character arc thus far had mostly focused on trying to find a cure for vampirism. Her sexuality was there, but it was subtle. Though there is the fact that the character she is sprung off from is almost universally depicted as a lesbian, and a main character to boot... something I would hope Scythe would have keyed into since my previous page depicted a different cross-section of the same universe. But alas.\n\nI politely declined, citing her sexuality. Having come to know Scythe better OOC, I was afraid he would take the rejection poorly. More than that, I was starting to realize that I couldn't stand his generally draining personality. A meme had gone around semi-recently asking RP partners to send their names in for a technique appraisal, and he sent himself in. Recognizing the Catch 22, I told him his RPing could stand to improve in very polite terms... and it devastated him for a week. So I was surprised and pleased that he seemed to take it with stride. That lasted for just long enough for me to feel my victory be drained from my body as he pitched the idea of a long-lost twin of last-of-his-race Marty Stu. A female twin. I didn't have a 'good' reason to say no this time, as I was sure anything in the realm of \"I just don't want to/It's not right for VampWitch/It's too early\" would be met with endless \"but why?\"'s.\n\nI hate that I gave in. I hate it now, but I hated it even then. I didn't want to alienate one of my earliest supporters and I was afraid of the backlash of not giving in. I was a stupid idiot, and VampWitch's character arc started to devolve into half vampire shenanigans, half slowly assimilating into a cardboard housewife, betrothed to the character I will name Bland Sue. And yes, I drew a portrait for her, too.\n\nMarty Stu was a bad character, but he was at least definable: he was an edgelord butler with a hair-trigger violent streak that should've cost him his job. Bland Sue was... nothing. I struggle even now to define her traits that weren't visual (and thus I designed, anyway...). She was mild, but she was stubborn. She was an airhead, but she was observant. She was responsible, but she was irresponsible. She was a dizzying mash of contradicting characterizations that only served to highlight whatever housewife fantasy Scythe wanted to play that day.\n\nWhile VampWitch was finding exotic ingredients for potions and stealing from important people's wine cellars in other threads, she was slowly being consumed by carrying threads like _VampWitch and Bland Sue make dinner_ (boring but reasonable if Scythe gave me anything to work with, which of course he didn't), _VampWitch and Bland Sue snuggle_ (totally out of character, but I felt strongarmed into it because I didn't want Scythe to pitch a fit), and eventually, _VampWitch and Bland Sue prepare for a baby_. Yeah.\n\nIf the lesbian thing wasn't enough, remember that VampWitch is a vampire. Undead. Her biological systems have ceased to operate in the human manner. Typically, this implies _infertility_.\n\nBut Scythe wanted a baby. VampWitch was already teetering out of her characterization with this relationship. I didn't want VampWitch to have a child, because it threw her characterization off the edge of the observable universe (remember: grumpy, hoarder, eats children to stay 'alive'). I tried to push back about it, but I couldn't deal with the guilt trips by Scythe. So once again, I eventually obliged. Again, I drew her, but in noticeably worse quality than the first two character portraits, because I was sick of this song and dance.\n\nThis is when my drive for RP started to grind to a halt. I couldn't get online and thread with my other partners on the site without also throwing Scythe a bone, because inevitably Scythe would see what I was doing, and if I didn't respond to the \\*snuggles* in my inbox, he would get huffy and bomb me with messages asking if I had seen the first message.\n\nNot only was Scythe expecting me to work his personal cardboard wife fantasies out of nothing, the posts I did get were usually full of typos or just straight up not reacting to what I'd posted. I'm not sure if Scythe was ESL, or instead mentally delayed, because we had numerous exchanges where he would misinterpret common phrases. For example:\n\n\"VampWitch stares in shock.\"\n\n\"Bland Sue recoils at the jolt.\"\n\nThis came to a head in what is still in my top 3 most painful RPs of all time. Dredging up the logs would require me to log into a long-dormant account, as we did this over the site's new-at-the-time messaging system, so I'll say what I can from memory (as if it'll ever be burned out of it, lol).\n\nVampWitch was returning home from a mushroom hunt in the forest, happy at being able to soon finish her in-progress potions, several of which she had bottled on her person, as otherwise she was concerned she'd lose them in her Hoarders-level home. Bland Sue greets her, and VampWitch excitedly shows her the bottles she's ready to complete, which I describe in detail because even if it's my shitty daily grind with Scythe, I can at least brainstorm some props for real RPs. This is where Scythe surprises me and has Bland Sue do something actually proactive for once.\n\nShe snatches one of the bottles out of her hand and drinks it.\n\n_Big dick move._ I actually have no idea how to react, and neither does VampWitch, who can only watch in shock as she watches the gross, sludgy-black liquid disappear inside the girl who's supposed to be her significant other. I'm not happy at the blatant disregard for my character from someone who's nominally supposed to care about her, and in a moment of weakness, I dangerously have VampWitch almost act like herself for once and yell at her \"wife\" Bland Sue for ruining her hard work. It turns out that doesn't matter, though, because this is where it gets weird.\n\nAs described by Scythe, a \"shadowy figure\" shoots at them out of nowhere!!!!1! Which... aside from the mood whiplash, is just strange. VampWitch is a vampire, and naturally has both excellent low-light vision and great hearing, making her especially in her element in the forest grove she calls her home. You would think that on her home turf, being borderline-paranoid about her home security, she would notice something like that before it got a chance to shoot. Alas, this is Scythe, and the mere presence of Bland Sue means VampWitch's characterization only appears when it happens to line up with the plan. Still, I guess things are actually happening this time, so I'll try to squeeze enjoyment of it.\n\nI decide VampWitch is hit in a not-particularly-lethal area, and she scrambles for cover, readying for a shootout. The \"shadowy figure\" introduces itself as Reaper and... flees. _Oh no, you didn't._ At this point, I'm ready to do anything to keep it from going back to the horrible cardboard grind, so I have VampWitch pursue, cussing and getting her weapon ready. Bland Sue decides to follow suit, and they chase Reaper into the mansion of the other notable vampire of VampWitch's (very fantasy) setting. At this point, Reaper has managed to somehow kidnap a side character of VampWitch's setting whom I will dub PurpleWitch along the way. Now, I don't play PurpleWitch. Neither does Scythe. But it becomes passive-agressively clear that Scythe expects me to narrate PurpleWitch. I think I just had her faint or somesuch. I don't remember. In any case, Marty Stu appears out of thin air, 'controlled' by Reaper, and beats the daylights out of Bland Sue while Reaper absconds with PurpleWitch through some ominous portal reminiscent of the potion Bland Sue had so kindly wasted.\n\nAt this point, I should have probably had VampWitch call it a day and get high on her mushrooms to forget it all, but I didn't. VampWitch wasn't the nicest sort, but I knew she would at least take chase for PurpleWitch, who didn't deserve to be in this mess. So I sighed, VampWitch sighed, and she went through the portal... who Bland Sue happily went through as well, somehow.\n\nWhat followed was perhaps the most underwhelming description of a \"twisted world\" I've been graced with to this day. Oh, and also, a _new_ character from VampWitch's setting who we'll call RealMaid, who I now of course need to play on the fly. VampWitch (played by me) fought the 'twisted' RealMaid (also played by me) while Bland Sue... cried about her injuries, basically. The silver lining of having RealMaid foisted on me was being able to put her out of her misery post-haste, at least.\n\nThey continued deeper into this anti-world thing that came out of left field (Bland Sue magically got her second wind, I guess), and thankfully catch up to Reaper within a few posts, who has, in the time it took to kill a maid, turned poor PurpleWitch into a half-robot(!?) somehow. Whom I now need to narrate fighting VampWitch and Bland Sue. Sigh. At this point, even my confrontation-hating self is over this trainwreck of a... roleplay? Is that what this was supposed to be, a roleplay? and so I _really_ half-ass my replies as Reaper gives an evil monologue about how she can never truly be defeated, as she's Bland Sue's evil clone created the moment she drank that potion...\n\nWhat.\n\nI'm sorry, what? You mean the unfinished potion that VampWitch, _my character_, had? You're not only going to pidgonhole me into your bullshit plots and straight-up ignore my character's input in favor of what you want to hear, but also you're going to tell me what _my_ character's magic does??\n\nThey (read: VampWitch) knocked out PurpleWitch and dragged her back into the real world or whatever, and I honestly don't remember what they did about the portal. VampWitch's last words to Bland Sue were something along the lines of \"Don't you ever do that again\". The veil was clearly lifting; what can I say. Sad that it took this long to become aware of how awful the whole situation was, though.\n\nI more or less abandoned my page not long after that, though I kept VampWitch semi-active in a fandom messaging chat with other muns for a while longer (which Scythe was also a part of, but luckily(?) he was able to find an audience with equally bad personalities). That chat could be a story in and of itself, but that's less horror and more drama and salt.\n\nHonestly, I miss VampWitch and I miss RP. But then I remember shit like this and lose all my drive and then some.\n\n**TL;DR** I encourage a guy's Marty Stu character. When he realizes he can't get into the pants of my witch character, he makes a female twin of the Stu who's somehow even worse than the original. With the new Sue, he railroads my witch into becoming a cardboard housewife stock fantasy with no regard for either her personality, her autonomy, or the setting. All while he gets free art from me.

            "selftext": "With the kind of drama that happened, I imagine this post might be longish. So here's about all of the people involved:\n\nAdmins:\n\nIrrational\n\nMr. Attorney\n\nHead Mod:\n\nAsshat\n\nMods:\n\nMe\n\nUltimateBetrayal\n\nBetrayal2\n\nNeverAround\n\nCreep:\n\nObsession\n\nPre-Drama:\n\nSo two years ago, I joined a dbz site, and was appointed a moderator due to applying for the position, and having experience as a forum mod. For two whole years I've been known for being able to \"grade like mad\", a decent writer, and pretty much one of the most devoted to the site. People came and went, some of them even being former staff, who had a lot of bad things to say about the site, the head admins, and etc.\n\nThings that I never understood why. Irrational had seemed nice enough. The atmosphere seemed fine, and during my two years here being a mod, I kept hoping that UltimateBetrayal would be asked to become a mod too, and he managed to become one this past year. Fastforward to me getting tired of Obsession dming (We use Discord for chat) me while in class at university, and I decide to block him. Now, the reason that he's a creep and is called obsession is because he clings onto people to try and thread with them, constantly saying that it's for \"story\". Dude's really annoying and has some kind of depression despite having nice things like a PS4 and etc. And I know that he must have depression, anxiety issues and etc. because he constantly tells people \"Love me\", constantly sighs, blehs, it's basically a whole bunch of attention seeking stuff.\n\nAfter I blocked this guy and decided I was going to stop talking to him, he started to treat me badly, taking away every nice thing he's ever said to me, and basically being on my blacklist. He used to be a mod before he was kicked off, as everyone got tired of him sulking, except for Irrational who he kisses up to and is friends with. Enough to where he's made a character whose obsessed with theirs.\n\nFastforward to this past year, Irrational decides to have staff discussions be on the forum, because she can't keep up with Discord chat (Staff chat doesn't move that fast at all. She has anxiety issues of her own, and somehow has befriended popular dbz artists who give her free art). We talk about double exp week, and she starts to *points fingers accusingly* at me and UltimateBetrayal, going on about how we should know better, because Asshat had brought up how back in January, me and UltimateBetrayal had planned to buy the item that would start double exp week, and take advantage of it. There's a good reason that he's called Asshat. Dude constantly brings up and uses his latin blood as an excuse for his temper, and has gotten into fights with Irrational countless times, and even with Mr. Attorney for a couple of them, yet has never received a site warning from it. Asshat is just allowed to leave the discord for a day on his own to throw a bitchfit, and is welcomed back into staff chat like nothing happened.\n\nI never wanted Asshat to be part of staff because of his anger issues, but neither Irrational nor Mr. Attorney, had ever really listened. The stupid thing about that is, Asshat has gotten into the kind of fights that make Irrational shake and cry, according to what she constantly claims. But he has still never gotten a warning for it not once. Irrational only has confided to UltimateBetrayal and Betrayal2 how she should have given him a written warning. And later on with this drama coming up, told Betrayal2 that Asshat would get one when she returns home, but never gave him it.\n\nGoing back to how Irrational was pointing fingers accusingly because of Asshat, I decide to argue with her. My first argument with Irrational, as I've never been kicked out of staffchat until this morning. The reason I chose to argue, was because a couple of months ago, I stated in general chat how Obsession had a character he only got because his character was permanently erased, and how if that character had somehow came back into existence, he would have to give up the replacement. Obsession had a panic attack and dmed along with facebook spammed Irrational to go and tell on me. Me bringing that up was pretty casual, but also reasonable, because he would otherwise have 2 powerful characters and basically cheat staff, since that other character was supposed to be erased forever.\n\nI get scolded by Irrational and Asshat, who butts in like he always does, where he also goes on about how Obsession is the poster child of what a new member is like. He's nowhere near the type of person a member should be, with his obvious anxiety issues. Some couple of months passed, and I later confided in Irrational about how I didn't like the idea of Obsession making a character who was obsessed with mine, as I didn't like him, he proved himself to be a creep, etc. There's a lot of reasons Irrational is labeled the way she is, and this is one example. Not only did she not see the problem with Obsession wanting to stalk me, she blatantly brushed off how uncomfortable I was with his idea, and even defended the panic attacks he had, going on about how he still thinks of talking to me, as if that's somehow supposed to make me want to start talking to him again. She's known for months how much I hated him. Stalking is one step away from rape, if this had been a real world situation. Yet she brushes off how uncomfortable I was. I never argue with her back then. I thought about it, but chose not to.\n\nFast forwarding back to double exp week, I decided to argue with her about this, because she was practically accusing me and UltimateBetrayal of cheating, when we had never given her a reason to do so. Our grading was consistent, and while UltimateBetrayal had began writing less and less the past couple of months, my wordcount continued to remain the same.\n\nUltimateBetrayal isn't the type to really argue for the year and half that I've known him. He's had bad experiences being a mod on other sites, being the main reason, so he just brushes off the accusation. But for me, it doesn't matter if she was trying to be cute or not, when she pointed fingers like that accusingly. I found it insulting, and defended my writing, going on about how if she had really cared, she would have actually commented on the defenses I've had, rather than write just a paragraph brushing things off.\n\nThis is when Asshat decides to join in, being like Obsession had, and taking back everything positive he had ever said about me. Insults my writing and calls it word diarrhea, among a bunch of other negative things I read, but mainly being offended for Irrational, despite the fact that these two fight enough to make her shake and cry. Another example of why she's labeled as Irrational. Those two take each other's side, and I get a site warning. UltimateBetrayal defends me, going on about how Asshat shouldn't insult my writing like that, while Betrayal2 is talking to me about how these two had gotten pissed because I had defended my writing. Irrational got pissed enough to also join Asshat and go on about how in the earlier days where I was a mod, I got complaints about me from a few members. Dbz, you see a lot of Mary Sues, and they make it pretty obvious that they're dumb individuals. She also uses Obsession as an example, continuing to ignore how that creep makes me uncomfortable, cause he also found my Deviantart and started favoriting things I never posted on the Discord like some stalker.\n\nI go quiet after that, not really talking for awhile, and Mr. Attorney offers that I can talk to him if I had wanted to, being the one who was absent for all of this drama. So I start coming to him to vent, talking to him politely and all though. Fastforward barely even a month later, which would be yesterday. Betrayal2 gets tired of me venting to him, who also offered the same thing and stops replying.\n\nHe's never made any indication he was tired of it beyond that, and I usually don't talk to people who don't reply to things, so I'm like whatever. I came home from a presentation at university, and find out that Asshat had tagged me, bitching about how I shouldn't let people know in the grading thread, that Irrational had messed up the grading. That I should have talked to her about it, despite not being on good terms with either of them.\n\nI complain to Mr. Attorney about it all, who is labeled as this, because he prides himself of being a libertarian, neutral, etc. He tells me he'll take care of things after his midterms. Well, here's where things go to shit and I got fired. I'm in class when Irrational dms me with a 'polite' wall of text that's labeled as from the staff team, and I notice that I'm no longer apart of staff chat. I later find out she offered me to talk to her, at the end of her wall of text, but the bullshit that's another example of how irrational she is, is how it's pretty obvious which parts that she wrote. Not only did she bring up the earlier days, which shouldn't really matter in comparison to the fights she gets into with Asshat, she always seen/made out Obsession to be a collective group instead of an individual. She didn't name him, but it was obvious she was talking about him in some parts of her wall of text. A lot of the crap she goes on about, involves how she's always seen me positively, which is an absolute lie, as I was able to tell four months ago (When we usually have our site events) that she had gotten impatient with me, accusing me of being heated. I wasn't.\n\nNow this is where UltimateBetrayal comes in. Instead of replying to Irrational, as I started to not like her pretty early on when I noticed she got impatient with me, I ask UltimateBetrayal what happened. Got him to directly state that he betrayed me, and pretty much talk to him for like a good hour. Not only did he vote against me, but he wanted me outright banned from the site. He Went on about how even Irrational and Asshat (The one who should have gotten fired before me) didn't even consider that as an option. They only wanted to kick me from staff. He also goes on about how he's been through my situation, which I'm very familiar with, and I go on about how his decision doesn't add up. He admits that he knows even if he didn't vote against me, it would have ended up with the same result, and I frankly tell him it was his support that really mattered more. Something he didn't give.\n\nIn the end, I decided that this site drama wasn't worth ruining our friendship, because I've tried here on Reddit looking for people who has his kind of writing quality/length, but no one ever responds to those ads. So I brush off his betrayal, and now I'm trying to see if he actually lives up to all the things he's said after about how he was going reply more to our threads. With how I've been able to write more than him this year, I honestly don't expect for him to keep up at all. He got pissed at Asshat for insulting my writing, but he also got over that pretty quickly, even though he's been through the same situation.\n\nNeverhere is only relevant, because alongside Asshat, he didn't get fired or anything, despite never grading and never really even talking. I had actually not talked on the server for a week, and only vented in dms, before finding that I was fired this morning. Only reason I'm still rping on this forum is to prove a point. One of them being how I was almost at End-Game, and another is to piss off Asshat, since I was told by UltimateBetrayal I made him think about leaving the site, and I still wish he did, no matter what good he did do for the site. Mr. Attorney pretty much winded up living to the expectation of what liars lawyers can be.",
