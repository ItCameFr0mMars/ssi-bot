They claimed that it was because they didn't think their messages got through, but I don't really believe that.\n\nThey most recently asked if I were getting bored (and honestly I kind of was) but it was in those 12-24 hour spans, which seemed to have shortened to 6-12 hours as time went by. I just blocked them because I honestly don't want to roleplay with someone who can't wait a couple of hours for a reply when I have other stuff that I need to do.",

Hmm\" and yes, they actually added the 'hmm's.\nI'm not stupid, I know what's happening. Don't try to force me to meta game just because you refuse to either go and have your panic attack, or calm down out of it. If you want my character to comfort your character, maybe have your character tell my character that.\n\nImagine if you were roleplaying a Skyrim-like setting and all your partner did was OOCly tell you some cool story about something in a cave just hoping that you'll randomly go in there.\nBut why should I go in this random cave?\n Is someone screaming? No.\n Is there something glinting? No. \nIs a dragon attacking and that's my only cover? No.\nDid I read a book about this cave at all? No.\nThen why should I go into it? Hmm.",
