            "selftext": "Disclaimer: English isnt my native language and most of it is self taught but despite that i feel like i write english well enough to be a writer (or some of my fellow rpers thought so). So if you see any major grammatical errors just chalk it up to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday i will tell you a story of an edgelord, a cringelord and so much more. Before continuing though i will need to post something about the characters (A short introduction and the style i had in mind when creating them) i played during this time. Might seem excessive but since alot of the cringey things are mainly IC it's so much better/worse when you have a sense of what the characters that i controlled were like. I'll keep it short though:\n\nSylvia Sunshard, an elven ranger/healer. Loves animals and is generally a very kind and soft person. She was pretty generic but leaned heavily to classic sci fi.\n\nKeya Gildas, an elven spy and a textbook example of a femme fatale down to speaking in a thick french accent, her being purposefully designed to be attractive and the way i wrote her. She's a psychopath by definition meaning that she is unable to form any real attachments. Most of her designs were vaporwave and synthwave themed.\n\nCole, a self learning AI inside a massive 6 meter tall siege automaton that was made and programmed during times of war. Because of this he relentlessly targets races with a certain biology. Think of Bastion but twice as big and 16 times the firepower. He was ment to be the nihilistic AI kind of character with 4th wall breaking jokes and contradicting programming. Cole had a heavy atompunk theme going on with the way he spoke and behaved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot exactly groundbreaking characters, i know but i like them well enough and they appear in my lore. The whole story went down about one and a half year ago, maybe even two or three years ago (i honestly cant remember) when i first got into rp. The cancer began at the second rp site i ever joined, i was invited there by a friend (who turned out to be a massive bellend later) . So a freshman of roleplay on a site that had a factions system, roleplayed politics and alot more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 1 - 'Welcome to hell! It's not how you thought it should be, huh?'**\n\nSo the horror begins the moment i install discord and join their server. I introduce myself and have a bit of a laugh with the staff team. I intended to use Keya Gildas so i post a picture of her ([This is the image](https://www.deviantart.com/ferdianza/art/Keya-641891964)) and pretty much immediatly i get a direct message from a person who i shall refer to as Johnny. Johnny joined the server not long before me and had already garnered quite a bit of infamy for how shite his character was and how disturbing the species was he created. Johnny played a character who's name i will not repeat because i dont want people to send him flak or even worse, be like me and give rping with him a shot so i will refer to his character as 'Duke'. Now Duke was an Ordriey (Yes that is the actual name of the species) and their deal is that they are immune to electricity, are reasonably tall, have a scorpion tail, only a furry bottom half, are pretty tough, are immune to the cold and had butterfly wings. It was an absolute pain to look at. In addition to that Ordriey could switch gender to mate, much like mosquitoes. In a vaccuum there is nothing wrong with fleshing out how your species breeds but there is a problem to it that will become more glaring later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i was on the server for an hour, maybe less and good ol' Johnny already wanted to play with me. I heard some buzz already about how bad his creations were but decided to be nice and give him a chance so his abomination got paired in a thread with Keya and it very quickly became clear he only wanted Duke to be shipped with her even though i made quite clear already that Keya is unable to form emotional attachments to other people. The thread itself was nothing to really write home about, just generic prison breakout antics although one thing did peak my interests: Keya was arrested on spy charges while Duke was thrown in for mass murder of random people, like a GTA5 killstreak. I already sensed that something was off but didnt listen to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a couple of threads and despite the fact that Johnny knew Keya was a psychopath he still made advancements with her and it resulted in Keya using Duke like a tool. Alot of the following threads were pretty generic, most of it was just recon missions and spy stuff with him acting like some sort of deranged Johnny English, it was very funny to be quite honest except that he didnt know he was doing a poor job at being a spy. I was sort of hoping he was aware of it and tried to turn it into some sort of action comedy plot but when Duke got reprimanded by Keya he genuinely had no idea what he did wrong to the point he sent me an Out Of Character message on Discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur 'plot' was wrapping up and by that i mean Keya caught the bad guy despite Duke acting like an idiot. It was actually a pretty charming end to our little action comedy but then he thought it would be a great idea to try and get me to write smut with him on discord out of the blue. I never witnessed any of this stuff before and i simply wasnt ready for it (I was 16 at the time too) nor did i want to see Keya without her clothes on and even less did i want to see Duke without his clothes on. He repeatedly asked me and i kept declining because i just didnt want to and he stopped once i told him my age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 2 - He who comes from the shadows, fire in his eyes and darkness surrounding his blade.**\n\nOddly, after i told Johnny i was 16 he seemingly took a hiatus from the site or at least started playing with other people. Dont worry though, he will be back and worse than ever. Months passed and with my amazing personality and my great characters i became moderator. Or maybe it was the cancerous memes i posted and the fact literally no one else wanted to fill the position, who knows. Nevertheless my popularity increased slowly and i introduced new characters like Sylvia while also making a faction and growing to decent power with it. But a new villain loomed on the horizon, the edgelord of all edgelords: *Lucifer...* Yes, that was his actual name. Lucifer was your average edgelord, the backstory was something of his mom being sacrificed and his dad not existing and he wanted to do nothing else than to rule the galaxy. To give you an idea of what this guy was like out of character: The signature on the forum was a naruto gif and he at some point asked if anyone on this site with roughly 56 members would be interested in animating an entire anime season that he directed for free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlot of the staff had a hard time determining wether he was a troll or not and personally i dont think so, he did seem to legitimatly care for his writing. His structure was certainly alot better than mine and he had a certain flair in his writing even if the content was as bland as a meal of styrofoam and water. Most of it was meaningless jabber about what hell was like and how his demonlord life was terrible and how he would have his revenge and as a person that doesnt really like anime reading this garbage was a chore. Anyway, back on track: Our forum had a 'development thread' system where you could increase the power of your faction or create more powerfull equipment based on your post length and thread length. (I.E 3 paragraphs on a thread with 10 posts could get you a faction tier levelup or maybe like a really strong weapon) I dont blame the admin for this, he is a nice person but in things like this he displayed signs of incompetence because no one would have predicted Lucifer would use his religious texts as development threads. To put it in perspective: My faction the immortals reached tier 3 in the span of 3.5 months, his faction the lucian empire (dat name tho) reached tier 3 in a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would often intrude on public threads as well usually giving the worst explanation of why his character is even there. One time i had a thread with Sylvia and this bounty hunter guy and Lucifer just strolled out of an alleyway trying to tag along even though the planet it was set on was well in enemy teritory of his faction. He tried to hit on Sylvia too believe it or not. The thing was though, Lucifer had this annoying practice of only responding to things he likes in the posts of his partner so he could be hitting on Sylvia even though she has made clear that she is a lesbian and already has a girlfriend and even with that girlfriend nearby, who was a hot headed criminal by the way he would just completely ignore her and only respond to the things he wanted to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis most infamous/amusing thing he ever did was when he made a race application for a race named 'kelopians' with a picture that is now being memed to shit on r/dankmemes with no nut november. The race was literally a god with only strengths and no weaknesses and he unsurprisingly goes on to get completely annihilated by the staff in that application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 3 - The war of darkness**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeeks pass and Lucifer with his god awfull empire is starting to really get on the nerves of some of the staff and as a junior moderator it was my job to keep the good peace between the actual staff members and lucifer and i can tell you that it was hard. First off Lucifer had a nasty attitude and apparently difficulty differentiating between IC and OOC. He would often post rants on how terrible the staff is in the OOC sections (That was intended to find rp parters by the way) and end those rants with something along the lines of '((Oh and OOC: Ur writing is awfull actually and if you dont approve my cancer i will leave the server.)) wich was bad in itself but we had a really toxic admin luitenant (I like to call it that) who actually went out of her way to insult him in all caps. Im not sure if she tried to fight fire with fire but it backfired horribly because now he wouldnt listen to anyone on the staff anymore, even me who he sort of kind of listened to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings were spiraling down in a hurry, especially when the lucian empire attacked asgard and executed Thor or something, idk. Some of the lore on the site was pretty bad. Tensions grew and alot of factions had an axe to grind with his empire. The biggest faction of robots hated him for his hamfisted political statements (Come to think of it, Lucifer was like a space Trump), The GSU (Earth government) hated him for attacking asgard and the immortals (My faction who were established as very violent abolitionists) hated them because they practiced slavery. What was his response? Well ally a bunch of small factions of course. It didnt work and he went on to get absolutely obliterated by a space alliance of 3 major powers and arrested. He actually had his character commit suicide - more on that in the next scene - shortly before leaving the site because staff denied one of his applications i think? Im not even sure, i was beyond done with him at that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly he wasnt done yet so he braided his fabulous long hair and came back from the dead to terrorize the galaxy once more since we didnt actually ban him. The plot of him coming back form the grave didnt go much further than \"i came back from hell once, ill do it again.\" This time he bettered his diplomatic relations and his reputation wents from -100 to 0. But Lucifer being Lucifer just couldnt leave things the way it was so he started executing nearby planetary leaders again and soon enough he was back at square one but this time he wouldnt kill himself, the end to his reign would be so much funnier but lets not get ahead of ourselves. Now that he was back after his hiatus he had an extra faction to worry about: The inquisitoral reich (Sorry if i was ment to keep that a secret, mav) wich was essentially like the warhammer space marines but with a pretty neat dieselpunk theme. Lucifer's antics quickly attracted the attention of major faction leaders once more yet this time, he wouldnt fall in battle...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was love... Love that betrayed him... Love that caught him in the end... Im not a 100% sure but i think those are his last words. But yes, his bleeding heart forced him to visit Apex-122 wich was the capitol of my faction that spitefully denied his offering of peace and declared him an enemy to visit Sylvia ([I had this as my profile picture on the account i played her on](https://www.deviantart.com/zenfulchaos/art/Art-Trade-Sylvia-Roothearth-675508815)) and he was actually dense enough to leave his automated planetary scanning devices on (What, those are standard in the new cars i hear.)... So like Al capone being arrested for tax evasion before being found guilty of his mobster crimes Lucifer was arrested on spy charges before being locked up for dictatorship. I think that prompted him to ragequit. Maybe a dick move on my end but everyone in the discord told me to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 4 - It's tough to be a god**\n\nNow i've hinted at it before but Lucifer hasnt been a very good boy out of character. That suicide i mentioned, he posted it in 'Returns and abscenses'. He often godmodded and powerplayed in threads and as i've mentioned as well he was prone to ignore things in posts that he didnt like. But beyond that he came up with some god awfull ideas for rp 'modes' as if the site was some sort of beta video game. One of my favorite ones was his pitch for 'interactive' rp where he would make the post and attach a poll with 4 options of what the selected char wich. If you have two braincells to rub together you realize it allows him to only give very submissive options wich especially in a thread with combat doesnt just give him an edge but straight up gives him the keys to victory. It got denied, obviously and he chalked it up to the staff not liking him. \n\n  \nThe second one is my personal favourite, it was a pitch for faction alliances. Note that he pitched this when the major power factions turned on him and his empire was about to get annihilated. The jest of his alliance pitch was that if you ally with him your allies or you couldnt attack him for the rest of your career on that site. In a nutshell if a minor faction that is allied to the immortals allies him i couldnt go to war with him anymore. That pitch too got denied and memed into oblivion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue with him was that his character had no real weaknesses. Originally his weaknesses were: A lack of dexterity, weakness to poison and a weakness to fire - as a demon lord mind you - but when he would fight characters that specialized in poison or agility he would completely negate taking any sort of damaging, usually with a cheesy \"You're going to have to do better than that.\"  This was actually the main thing that got him banned as he often disregarded his own writing and play off lucifer as some sort of god even though compared to other characters he was a bit of a pushover. After he left he came back once to advertise an attack on titan roleplay site once and that's the last time i heard of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 5 - Return of Johnny and Duke**\n\nAfter Lucifer was gameended twice he pretty much left the site and we could actually decently roleplay on there for a bit. There was some drama that i dont care to talk about here but the big robot faction got scrapped, the immortals fell and reverted into some sort of robin hood esque pirate fleet under the rule of pirate queen Kat Kheylana. Sadly Johnny's hiatus to arkham assylum had ended and he returned to our site to bestow upon us nothing but cancer. He started out strong by creating a new race that he named Drakkoli or something that looked like actual demon spawns with oversized feet. He proceeded to make an absolute fool of himself by throwing an IC tantrum upon finding out that in the months he's been gone Keya moved on to some sort of big military or political leader that she can use (i honestly dont even remember) before proceeding to try and keep Sylvia hostage in a forest. From that thread a beautifull meme sprouted however because he tried to push his face in her cleavage but he apparently forgot that Sylvia wears a metal chestpiece so all he did is slam his face into a block of reinforced metal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was just Johnny playing Duke the way we know him so we didnt really comment on it. Now that Duke will be in the spotlight for a bit longer ill just explain what ordrieys were like: Ugly, just ugly. He had a lot of art of Ordriey and they just looked horrible, they had like the body of your average furry but a human head with long ears and black circles around the eyes and a black dot on the nose like dog make up. He actually made an image of it once where Duke was snarling, it looked like Pennywise from IT. Now in itself i wouldnt have minded the Ordriey if they were specifically made to be ugly and unattractive because the whole style of it reminded me of Zeno Clash but issues began to arise when he openly admitted to getting his rocks off to it. From that point we actually checked out some of his creations and almost all of it was geared towards fetish stuff ranging from common hermaphrodites, male birth, gender swapping and even their main ability to be able to eat any material. It quickly became clear that Johnny's creations were not just cringey but straight up harmfull and this became even more apparent when he gave birth in a public thread (This was before the site had an NSFW section) and when he tried to eat a half dead enemy who thank god was saved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scene 6 - Exterminatus.**\n\nWe were incredibly lenient with Johnny honestly. All his crimes on here have been mostly IC but he was a really toxic person in the discord as well. He frequently threw tantrums, harassed other members, posted creepy art and when he got in trouble he pulled the old reliable victim card. When he got reprimanded he would often ignore all of it and just accuse staff of hating furries or just cry about how his rabbit recently died despite knowing what angora rabbits can and cant eat to survive (another time maybe). Any convo we had he always tried to make about himself and he almost always came online with some sort of sob story about how bad his day was or a massive exaggeration of what happened that day. Actually let me hop back to a thing that really rubbed me the wrong way once: His tendency to make things about himself. We usually signed on around the same time and one day i actually nearly died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I used to live in a reasonably small village where people would drive really fast and one day i actually almost got hit, it was bound to happen someday with how fast people drive there but it scared me in the moment. I eventually mentioned it that evening and his response was \"OMG I ALSO ALMOST GOT HIT BY A TRUCK!\" and i get that he might be trying to help by indicating he also lived through it maybe but it really felt as if whenever someone was getting a bit of attention he would one up it to claim it all for himself. Most of it was bullshit as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had an IC channel for a while and guess who was the reason we shut it down? It was originally ment to limit IC meme convos in the general chat but it evolved into an alternative for the site for people who werent at the pc. Too bad Duke was more in the IC chat channel than on the actual site, usually sobbing for attention. When Keya dumped him he emoted completely shaving himself bald in that channel (as if that would help). The IC channel was a prime display of how disturbing his roleplaying could get but alot of us balanced it out with comedy relief characters. In my case he would have my character Cole on his back since Ordriey match his kill on sight criteria but also match the protection criteria since the whole design of the character is such a mess. Johnny would often end funny threads by just emoting being sad and alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe inevitably got banned and as a fun send off (for us) we proceeded to obliterate his planet and exterminate all life on it. At first glance this just seems like a dick move but the admin wouldnt let us just remove it, this was a way for the site members to remove it from the lore in a lore friendly way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ending**\n\nOverall the site was alot of fun while it lasted. I have a LOT of stories left to tell from a creepy nonce getting banned to cringey cassanova joining our site. Those will be for another time though. In conclusion it can be hard to manage a community of internet cancer but it's important to know where to draw the line. We drew the line at Duke and Lucifer.",
