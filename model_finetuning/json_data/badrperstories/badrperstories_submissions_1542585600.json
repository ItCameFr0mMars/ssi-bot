This type is what I call the \"Attacking Coward\" The AC is someone who likes to pick fights, but can't stand their ground, and often interactions with them go like this;\n\nNormal\nNormal\nNormal\n\nAC suddenly flips their lid, cusses me out, and blocks me. \n\nWell recently I met an AC, we'll call him/her Z.\n\nZ sent me a hello. I replied.\n\nI told Z I was tired. They made a joke about waking me up with explosives.\n\nNot wanting to come off as a stiff, I made two jokes. Both were clean, safe, and not political, religious, racist, sexist etc in any form.\n\nZ seemed to get my humor.\n\nI was gone for a while because I had to work overtime.\n\nZ...messages me letting me know I'm boring, a cunt, and a shithead...and then removed me from his friend list, so I had no chance to reply. Honestly, I wasn't going to cuss him/her out or anything. I was just going to let them know that I understood they were upset, and while I would love to chat, and hang out, I also have real-world responsibilities like a job. I like to try and avoid arguing if possible, and if they hadn't been so quick to block me, I would have liked to see a compromise...maybe an apology too, but I doubt it would have happened. \n\nOh well.\n",
