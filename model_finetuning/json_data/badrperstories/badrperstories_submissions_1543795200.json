            "selftext": "2 years ago, I made a Pokemon RP.  It was a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Style roleplay where all of our characters were Pokemon.  I have dozens of stories about this RP, but right now, I wanna focus on one bad character in particular.\n\nOur story begins one day when a mun declares that they had failed their characters.  This was completely out of left field and nobody in the RP was expecting it.  They seemed to think that their characters had departed from their original premises, but it was a while ago so I hardly remember the impetus.  So after leaving the RP for a few days, the mun came back with all of their characters as well as a brand new one.  In order to talk about this new character I need to talk about another, who I'll be calling Navi.\n\nNavi was an Espeon who initially had a racist streak.  She discriminated against other Pokemon by typing... Which just seems wrong when her species' entire gimmick is being able to evolve into several different types.  This aspect of her personality had been dead and buried for months at this point, but her mun decided that it needed to come back.  At one point she made casually racist remarks towards ghost types.  Which... alright, that's your prerogative... but it just seems kinda weird when at this point in time, she was not only raising a dark type child, but was in a romantic relationship with a Dark Type (He's mine, and I'll call him Johnny).  Eventually a solo scene played out (We had more of these than we really should've had) in which a mysterious Umbreon appeared and attacked Navi in her sleep.  This caused her to develop a fear of her own boyfriend, which... okay, it kinda annoyed me because I wasn't ever consulted about this, but considering her boyfriend was a reformed villain, it's stupid, but not *that* stupid.  Her being afraid of her **adopted son** *is* that stupid.\n\nBut I haven't even gotten to the reason I'm here: The Mysterious Umbreon.  He was what nails on a chalkboard would be like it it had a personality, so I'm gonna call him Nails.  This mystery man made no friends fast.  His first character interaction was trying to manipulate Johnny into breaking up with Navi.  As a villain, Johnny was a manipulator as well, so naturally he called bullshit.  In response, Nails assaulted Johnny and ran away.  He would continue to be *charming* to several other characters, including picking fights with retired assassins for no reason, and literally trying to publicly murder a child in broad daylight.\n\nHis reasoning for trying to kill that child?  The child happened to be an Eevee (Played by another mun) who lived in the setting.  Nails assumed that this child belonged to Navi, and started to repeatedly ask who her mom was.  When the child didn't give him the answer he wanted (She knew nothing about her mom), he decided to try and beat it out of her.  Imagine seeing a grown-ass man assaulting a 4 year old on a wild guess that she was related to someone he hates.  That's what was happening here.\n\nHis motive was flimsy at best.  He was revealed to be Navi's twin brother who was trying to get revenge on her for getting adopted while he was apparently forced to live in the wild.  And then at one point he became a prostitute to an edgy pimp.  That last bit was conceived after several people made it clear that they didn't like Nails, so it's obvious that it was an attempt to manipulate everyone else into feeling sympathy for him.\n\nAnd I would've been willing to see where his character developed if Nails actually showed any sort of remorse for his outright evil actions.  But he never did.  In fact, he outright said that he didn't regret anything he'd done, including the child abuse, even after Navi decided to forgive him because he's \"family\".  He then immediately took advantage of her good will by stealing her credit card and using it to buy expensive booze.  I wish I was making this shit up.\n\nThis character did not have a single trait that could be seen as likable.  He was a selfish alcoholic sociopath who was dangerously mentally ill to the point that that I, in character as Johnny, the character that hated him more than anyone, said he needed to see a psychiatrist.  And the debate was shut down with him saying he didn't want one and therefore didn't need to see one.\n\nDespite all of this crap... he never went away.  Ever.  The admin who owned the server kept stanning for him, despite him having zero traits any human who wasn't a serial killer could like, and even played Nails' boyfriend.  He eventually became this supposedly dangerous information broker who somehow had the money for assassins... despite being stupid enough to assault a 4 year old on a wild guess in broad daylight and to randomly pick fights with people for no reason other than to be a dick.  This amounted to one scene in one (1) storyline.  And at the end of it all, he got a happy ending with like 10 kids despite doing nothing to deserve it.\n\nTL;DR: Unrepentant Sociopathic character shows up, does some jerk-sue bullshit and comes out on top.",

I know my strengths, and at best, I am very aware and conscious of what I require to ensure a successful bout of writing with a partner. When I meet someone new I am about to write with, there is usually a checklist that I go down to make sure we're starting off on the right foot.\n\nThat includes thing like general writing style, what we hope to get out of our story, the type of characters we want to write, any plot devices we want to use and elements we want to include along the way. Most importantly, a plot/story that gives us enough to really make something compelling, something that can carry us past an opening scene or smut.\n\nI'll met someone, they seem nice and well-written enough that I'm confident in the RP. Characters are fleshed out enough, plot is good to go. I'm excited.\n\nAnd then comes the part that I recently have discovered really, really disappoints me. It feels like it should be common sense for *any* writer at *any* level, but I still encounter it.\n\nI find that I am the only one moving the story along.\n\n1. **My character** does this, says this, this happens in my post.\n2. **Their character** *does nothing but responds and reacts to what I have written, without adding anything to the scene or anything new.*\n\n*The way I see it, it should always be like this, in the context of IC time passage.*\n\n**\\[-----------------------------------------------------Passage of IC time-----------------------------------------------------\\]**\n\n\\[--------My post--------\\]\n\n...................\\[--------Their post--------\\]\n\n.........................................\\[--------My post--------\\]\n\n...........................................................\\[--------Their post--------\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*But instead, it just becomes:*\n\n**\\[-----------------------------------------------------Passage of IC time-----------------------------------------------------\\]**\n\n\\[--------My post--------\\]\n\n\\[--------Their post-----\\]\n\n...................................\\[--------My post--------\\]\n\n...................................\\[-------Their post------\\]\n\n......................................................................\\[--------My post--------\\]\n\n......................................................................\\[-------Their post------\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is driving me mad.

I've seen so many people who resort to godmodding just because their precious little OC is about to get beat up. There are a lot of cases where it's good to lose a fight since it goes into some natural character growth. And if you have TWO people who don't want to lose, well too bad. \n\n\n**2. Gather 'Round!**\n\nThis is related to RPs in public servers. Whenever anything remotely interesting happens, the whole server gets clustered together trying to get the main role, resulting in a very messy and unorganised scene. If you see something interesting, don't interfere. Just try to make an actual RP. And on that note... \n\n\n**3. Messy construction**\n\nWhen you're setting up a roleplay, the plot is usually gonna be good vs evil. There's nothing stopping that. The problem is when they end the set-up then and there and just make up the story on the fly. This results in very short and uninteresting roleplays with nothing to be gained. You need to make a general plot that goes beyond good guys fighting bad guys. \n\n**4. Godmodding**\n\nJust... just godmodding. At best it annoys players and gets you banned and at worst, it gets everyone to leave the server in annoyance. Godmodding breaks an rp. And it's when people say 'no miss' that really infuriates me. You can't just add bonuses out your ass. I know godmodding, you know godmodding, and we all hate godmodding. \n\n\nSo yeah! There are some signs of a bad role player, at least that I have found. If you have any others not related, a reply showing them would be appreciated.",
