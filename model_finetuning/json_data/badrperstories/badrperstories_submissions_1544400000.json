            "selftext": "Sorry if this isn't quite the correct place for this post.   \nI\"m sort of at a loss here. I want/need to know how to keep from going nuts in this situation or if I should just cut my losses and give up. I feel like this has probably happened to many people before in every fandom and I want to know how you get through it or what happened.   \nBut here's my situation:  \n\n\nI'm struggling with a Mun, \"Dibs\", who has, to put it frankly, hogged up all of the muses of certain Canons. The muns behind those canons say that they're still open for RP and Ships, but their actions..suggest otherwise.   \n\n\nI keep telling myself it's just because these two muns and Dibs have history that they seem to give her preferential treatment but like, being put on the backburner as often as I am, makes me think that they really don't care to RP with me but are too nice to say so? \n\nA vast majority of the posts on these RP blogs are about Dibs in some way whether it's one of many replies for that day, anonymous asks gushing about the ship, or Dibs and muns tagging each other in reblogs. THere are other people engaging but they too don't get nearly as much attention. They do get more replies and engagement than I do, however.  \n\n\nI haven't spoken to the Muns because what could I possibly say? That I'm salty? Jealous? That I dont' think it's fair? It doesn't really matter what I think because they're doing it for fun and if replying to Dibs several times a session and to me once is how they have fun then who am I to criticize them for that and guilt them into changing their ways for my sake? So I just sit and wait for them to throw me a bone when, I guess, they're bored or waiting on Dibs and grit my teeth every time they post an \"anonymous\" ask about how Perfect and Wonderful their ship with Dibs and bang my head on the keyboard every time yet another reply is posted to Dibs RP post.   \n\n\nI suspect that Dibs sends anonymous asks about the ships to fabricate a fandom/support for the ship but of course who really knows. It's always anon gushing about the ship and how great it is and anons asking about the wellbeing of the characters if they're ina rough patch or asking about future babies etc. Just weird that they're always anonymous instead of one of the many followers of that mun or Dibs who, I would think, would be happy to OPENLY show their support?? Instead of behind anon? \n\n  \nIf I go into too much detail, this post will get too long. I've already had to delete a handful of paragraphs a few times. I'm just super frustrated. I don't know if it's how I Rp, if it's my muse or if they just really like her OC thaaaat much??   \nI'm in the fucking dark and I don't know why I'm being shoved to the side while Dibs is getting showered in attention.   \nThe one person I'm actually quite friendly with doesn't RP. Just my luck.   \n\n\nI wish it were a more widely RP'd character so maybe this wouldn't be a problem. I wish I knew what I could do to entice the other muns. I've tried RPing with other characters. I've engaged with others so that I can broaden my horizons, so that I can have a nice RP history  and have it have variety and just to get my mind off of this. Only two others have taken a bite, one of which a sideblog to one of the aforementioned muns (but a totally different character than the one I\"m trying to RP and ship with ) and the other a totally random character for the fandom who I can't seem to find after moving blogs. I've tried sending asks and ask memes to these muns, I've tried reblogging prompts and memes myself and inviting people to send them in. I've tried putting out Starter Calls. I've tried following other blogs. I\"m at a loss.   \n\n\nI just..must be really bad at RP or something?? But even so, I still dont get what Dibs has that makes her so special? That makes her and her muse so enticing? \n\nWTF am I missing here???? Did something change since I last RP'd years ago?\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "tl;dr If you let a player clique take control of part of your forum, they just might try to take over the rest of the group. And then when you ask for it back, well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce there was a magnificent castle. It took many years of blood, sweat and toil to build. It was the efforts of many, guided by a benevolent king. He gave them the tools and resources they needed to erect lofty towers, plant beautiful gardens, and their efforts brought in many a traveler. This wasn't a place to visit. It was a home. \n\n\"We need no walls,\" the king declared. \"We need no guards.\" For they had no need. There were no enemies, only allies, as far as the eye could see. All was peaceful for many, many years. Or so it seemed. \n\nFor there was a seed of discontent planted early on. \"The king doesn't listen to us,\" the whispers said. \"We don't want towers and gardens. We need walls! We need guards! We need to be protected!\" And thus, an enemy was born from within. \n\nThe king in all his wisdom gave them a parcel of land. \"Build yourselves a fortress so you might feel safe.\" He thought he was showing them kindness. Everyone in his kingdom deserved kindness. \n\nSo they built their fortress and their walls grew so high none could scale them, none could see in. Sentries stood vigilant. Few were allowed past those gates. Now they were safe, now they were secure. It wasn't enough. Locked away, out of sight, the whispers grew to rumbles. \"The king doesn't listen to us. See them out there? They should be like us.\" Out went the spies. \n\nInto the beautiful city they went, spreading their deceit. Half-truths twisted in the worst of ways. \"The king doesn't listen to us. The city is dying! Come with us,\" they'd offer to the panic. \"We'll take care of you.\" People began to go to the fortress. Where none could see in--and they could not see out. The darkness became their truth and it began to twist them, too. \n\nToo late the king saw what was going on. He rode to the fortress walls and demanded to speak to the people. He begged at the wall, \"Please come back! Our towers need repair, our gardens need tending! Without you we will surely fail.\" \n\nOpen swun the gates, and there stood a gnarled figure, bent-spined and leaning heavily upon his cane. A dark crown barely visible in the shadows of his hood. \"What about the wolves?\" He asked. \"What are you going to do about the wolves?\" \n\nConfused the king shook his head. \"There are no wolves,\" he replied, baffled. \"We are safe in the city.\" \n\n\"We must have walls, we must have guards.\" The crooked king demanded. \"There have always been walls and guards.\" The gates swung shut.\n\nAgain the king shook his head. \"Never, there have never been walls. We have never needed guards? Who must we protect ourselves from?\" \n\n\"If we cannot have walls, you cannot have our gardens.\" The locks were turned. \"You can't have our fortress.\" \n\nDejected, the king stared up at the fortress now towering over the city. \n\n\"I never asked for it.\"",

            "selftext": "It was a long time coming, and it was partially my fault for allowing them so much 'power'. They both started out as simple mods with a single task apiece, but gradually, slowly started suggesting new ideas for the roleplay that I had lovingly crafted for the past year. I was okay with that. I love sharing and brainstorming with people. Some ideas I liked, some I didn't, and they both accepted this. \n\nThen they started offering to help with a bit of coding here and there. They were more skilled than I, so I gave them a bit of admin rights to the forum so that they could look at my coding. Over time they took more and more responsibility over the code and I trusted them to upkeep it. \n\nThen they began to tell me that we needed a new site layout, that the one that I had created wasn't efficient enough. Apparently they'd already started working on it. I dug my heels in for a long time on it because I had spent weeks on end sculpting the existing one. It was my creation, much as the entire site was. I finally gave in on the condition that I would oversee the entire thing and it would come out looking like I wanted.\n\nAfter that they started asking if we could change this rule or that, and while I said no, from time to time I would notice that something was changed. I would demand that they change it back, and they did. They would be unhappy about it, but they would change it back. \n\nThen they asked if they could create a new faction of their own in character. (There were already three) I didn't have any problem with this. Until I realized that their faction did not follow a single shred of the lore that I had built, not one bit. They'd created their own...*everything* for it. \n\nFor example, all of the groups had a specifically named ranking system that was supposed to be based on ancient history. Regardless of who you were IC you followed the history because it was 'written by the gods'. \n\nBesides it being very specific in character, it got very confusing for players who wanted to join that group. Everyone else was named and ranked one thing, even listed on site rosters, and then 'wait what are these?' \n\nThen they started changing the names of all the things that I had created, even stuff written on the maps, group names, and other rank names. They started asking if we could remove this rank or that. I would say no, and they would both stand up against me and tell me that I was outvoted. \n\nIt got to the point that I could not even write out an announcement for the site without them telling me 'you should have asked us first' or 'Wait for us to proofread it'.  Any ideas that I had for the site were to be approved beforehand, and often rejected entirely. I would spend days crafting an idea for a game or something only to have them tell me that their ideas would come first and mine could be released to the public in two months time.\n\n Then they'd do a 'but we're all a TEAM!' if I got angry.\n\nThe final straw for me was actually *two* straws...\n\nI told them weeks before that I didn't want a specific member to have a high ranking character due to their on again off again status on site. They could be around for four months with tons of activity and the next thing poof, gone without a word. I noticed the other day that despite having numerous discussions on this, sternly telling them that I did NOT want them holding important plot in their hands, they were discussing it casually anyway, that they were about to rank them up.\n\nWe had decided together that at the end of our winter contest I would give the winner a prize, a piece of my own artwork. I came in two days ago to a message saying that they didn't think I could do the art very quickly, so they asked another artist to paint for them instead of me.\n\nI finally told them that they could have what was left of 'my' site, that I was simply done. \n\nTheir response? Basically:\n\n'Aw, okay. In other news, (so and so) I have this awesome plan I want to discuss with you.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hello all. Long time lurker on this forum, and I finally have something to vent about. \n\n*Deep breath*\n\nSo just a little quick background, I\u2019m a Mod of a decently sized RP Sub. Because I get so much spam, I\u2019ve made it very clear on my posts as well as my user profile that I am *not* looking for rp partners and don\u2019t want to be asked or messaged for roleplay (already have a long term partner that I enjoy immensely etc). \n\nDespite this fact, I get probably four or more requests every week for some sort of lewd Roleplay. Everything ranging from rape to one liners. \n\nA couple weeks ago I handled a ban appeal for a user on the sub, today I woke up to find a completely inappropriate request from this same user who I have never once talked to besides from handling their ban appeal. \n\nHere it is; \n\n*\u201dHey! I was thinking of the subreddit and I actually had a unique RP idea in mind if you\u2019re interested in doing it with me. :)\n\nSo really what it is... is you basically blackmail me into worshipping / pleasuring you. \n\nWe\u2019d be playing ourselves. \n\nYou confront me saying that I didn\u2019t put \u201cI am 18+ and all characters and participants must be 18+\u201d in my post, even though I did. \n\nI say \u201cWhat? But I did!\u201d then check to see my post only to find that it was erased... somehow from my end as well (which was your doing). \n\nYou then say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry [his name] but rules are rules and I will have to ban you again..\u201d\n\nAnd then I beg and plead for forgiveness even though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, then I accidentally slip out and say, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything (to not be banned!)\u201d\n\nYou grin and say, \u201cAnything?\u201d\n\nThen that\u2019s where the worshipping starts.~\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re interested!\u201d*\n\nNeedless to say I told him how inappropriate it was and basically asked him not to pm me unless it had something to do with the subreddit. He then told me that my response was totally \u201cuncalled for\u201d, and that I was being disrespectful. \n\nI cannot fathom how he twisted it in his mind, to where it became my fault, that he wanted to do a lewd Roleplay with me, that I was completely disinterested in... and that I denied him. \n\nThat\u2019s basically my rant. This is by far the most inappropriate request I\u2019ve gotten, but I get them frequently. \ud83d\ude11 It annoys me to no end. ",
