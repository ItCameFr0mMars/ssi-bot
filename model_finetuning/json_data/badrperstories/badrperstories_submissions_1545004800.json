I always try to be respectful but this guy got me very frustrated. I responded to a post and added this guy (don't remember his name but we can call him Dick) \n\nBefore we start dick explains his idea I believe it was a school rp where an enchantment makes it so everyone in school can't help but be attracted to him. Ok, I'm new so I'm guessing we'll pick a few characters and make subplots with different characters or something but no asks me to play every character but his. I was really confused because I'm not very good at adding in a 2nd voice let alone a whole student body but he says he doesn't mind, so we venture forward. We started small with 1 on 1 interaction but he probably wasn't getting off so he turned it up to eleven fast. skipping to a hallway scene where he walked down the hall talking to everyone at their lockers wanting me to stroke his ego. sure its part of the story so I start flirting with him but he just doesn't get it. I'm really trying to play every part but his but dick wants to get to the fucking already. so he speeds it up again. I am not without my flaws so I stop the rp and ask \"what are you doing?\" he responded something like \" I'm not really feeling it could you try better\" dude you have me playing everyone in school and I'm really trying so I'm complimenting his smell, his looks all that jazz but he just want to get to the part where he fucks everyone. I told him \"I'm trying to paint a picture\" and he just responds \" yea but it doesn't feel like you want me, I want it to feel like you can't resist me\" pretty much that told me everytime he talks to me just say \"I want you to fuck me\" that's pretty much how the rest of the rp went. he wasn't really contributing to the rp either he just wanted compliments thrown at him while he sat there. I wasn't having it I told him to contribute, a basic thing about storytelling I was always told was to show don't tell. he tried but I just more frustrated so I ended it. I'm not very good at storytelling but I'm trying to improve it just got me mad that all he wanted was a personal smut writer to boost and stroke his ego both metaphorically and probably physically. let me know what you think, personally this guys perceptions is very one-sided did not enjoy.",

            "selftext": "In my last writeup here, I'd talked about the tale of [VampWitch and Bland Sue](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/9qrmte/dont_godmode_my_goddamn_potions_or_why_i_no/). With my motivation to play VampWitch dying, I'd retreated my roleplaying activities into a big fandom-based roleplaying server. Although there were plenty of... colorful individuals during my time there, I won't need to be going into pseudonyms here, as this is more about the aggregate behavior of the chat.\n\nIt's important to note a few things about the setting before the story proper. One, the setting of this particular franchise is a fantasy kitchen sink that practically begs for crossovers by its nature, and therefore there were a significant number of people playing muses not native to the setting, and even a handful of people who had little interest in picking up the (admittedly sprawling and hard to parse) source material but enjoyed the setting it offered and the other people who played in it. Two, while there were undeniably males in the canon of the franchise, they were delegated to supporting roles or as part of the faceless masses, and the named characters (of which there were _many_) were almost exclusively females.\n\nIf you're connecting the dots to think \"so lots of people made male characters to bang the canon girls\", well... there's a shade of truth to that, but it's not that simple. There were a few who tried during my time there (such as in the aforementioned story), but by and large they either got angry and left when the other players (muns) didn't pander to them, or paired off with each other. The majority of muns brought girls into the fray, and though a few boy-playing muns who weren't in the aforementioned group existed, they were pretty rare.\n\nI was getting burnt out of playing VampWitch on-site, but dropping her into the bustling server chatrooms was breathing life back into her. Sure, the encounters were hit and miss, but eventually she was able to find a good character development niche with a handful of other muns. This culminated in a storyline with VampWitch being controlled by her sire (who I also played) against her will, with a few other muses connecting the dots, leading to a intervention-esque confrontation. It wasn't ow-the-edge levels of dark, but it was a subtle horror and I loved it. The people plotting with me loved it.\n\nThe rest of the server did _not_ love it.\n\nBecause I can't have nice things, this sparked huge drama in the OOC sections of the server spearheaded by a handful of people who weren't even involved in the storyline. Yes, you read that right. People who _weren't even part of plot with VampWitch_ were getting into spats over how they thought VampWitch's arc should be handled. I'm not sure if I'm more alarmed in retrospect by the fact that they were that emotionally invested in VampWitch's arc as bystanders, or that they were somehow able to pay that much attention given the chatroom format of the place. Honestly... the whole situation sounds so much like a self-centered RPer's wet dream that it still flabbergasts me that it even happened. It was a red flag about the attitudes of the place. And as a timid person who didn't want any animosity from a silly RP, it freaked me out. I silently decided I would can the plotline for the sake of keeping the peace, and eventually it fell into the chat's collective forgotten memory (I tried to continue it privately with the primarily involved mun later, but the spark was gone and it dissolved pretty fast).\n\nSo, this is where I decided I needed a new character. People were too passionate about VampWitch and it was destroying my spirit to play (what a sentence, eh?). Well, lucky me, because a friend had recently introduced me to an unpopular but easily wiki-able horror game and I fell in love with a character there, a slow-burn backstabber who's villain resume includes destroying a pair of kingdoms, performing personal atrocities on his brother and his love interest that would make a lot of otherwise comparable villains squirm in discomfort upon hearing, and worst of all, being given deceptively cute in-game art. Think Petyr Baelish from Game of Thrones crossed with the Joker, but presented as an innocuous ally with subtle foreshadowing.\n\nMaybe I should've thought about _why_ it felt like everyone was up in arms over VampWitch before switching over to this totally definitely wholesome guy in particular. I'll call him... Salt. Yeah, no reason.\n\nI was _super_ excited to play Salt. He was a fresh start for me, from a fresh setting, and I could build his arcs from the ground up without the snafus of characters past. I excitedly babbled about the ways I would adapt him to the setting in the OOC chat, and everyone seemed excited to see him in the RP rooms soon.\n\nUntil I actually dropped him in, that was.\n\nSee, I had a plan here. I would have him assume the persona of a happy-go-lucky traveler, eagerly chatting up the other characters as he slowly worked his way towards the inner circles of the social power structures. He would build his reputation as a 'good guy', and once sufficiently integrated, start his bid for power through covert, layered schemes \u00e0 la some of the more involved canon arcs. \n\nFrom his very first hello, he was met with hostility. Suddenly, everyone was wary of this inconspicuous traveler. Everyone could sense his 'bad aura', or his 'evil soul', or something of similar, senseless metagaming ilk. Some even went as far as to know the specifics of his crimes in the other realm! Now, it's not to say there couldn't be justifications for cottoning onto his nature on a case by case basis. I could see an older, wiser character who's seen his type before think better of trusting him. Heck, there was even one person who occasionally played a different character from his universe in the chat, and if someone's character interacted with that one, they could probably put two and two together if they asked the right questions.\n\nBut nope. This was not the case even once. It was like ordinary life in the realm was interrupted so everyone could rag on Salt for existing, in painfully perfect sync. He devolved into something of the chat punching bag, and I played along for a while because I logic'd it would be obscene to play a villain who never faces backlash from their actions... though it became increasingly clear over the months that they would never even let him act. My hopes got up when Salt talked to a mermaid who seemed like she would break the mold and treat him like your average traveler, and the encounter ended on a high note. They were dashed the second time they ran into each other, when she suddenly became distant and claimed her friends had given her a stern talking to to avoid Salt. The mun was clearly uncomfortable, so I didn't push it. Joy of joys, back to square zero.\n\nAt this point, I was smelling the bullshit, and my initial excitement had been trodden into anger and sore ego. I had no reason to think the chat would turn on Salt so badly when I'd had mixed success with both VampWitch and Sire. Notably, Sire was just as evil a person as Salt, yet for whatever reason she was treated by other muses with a slap on the wrist at worst. In my bitterness, I hatched a little plan to try and figure out what the hell was going on with these people and what set them off on Salt so badly while they turned a blind eye to Sire.\n\nI introduced a new character into the rooms, dubbed BabyMomma. BabyMomma used to be a gentle girl, but fell into a bitter life of crime, dark magic, and abuse at the hands of Salt. Put simply, she's the Harley Quinn to Salt's Joker. Perhaps most notably, she uses a visceral brand of magic you generally don't see outside evil characters across fiction.\n\nWhat does the chat do? They treat her as a sweet, innocent child that needs to be fixed (_BARF_) so she can see the light. No characters seem particularly frightened of her style of magic. She gets invited for tea and cookies. People like her. They're 'willing' to ignore her gruesome traits in favor of spoiling her. BabyMomma handles it with the grace one might expect from someone who takes a mile when someone gives an inch. She gets no backlash.\n\n...well, okay, ew. At this point, I figure maybe it's a sexism thing, and I want to test my hypothesis. So I start making icons for a fairy boy, Baker, from a different universe entirely. Baker is a young teenager who, for the sake of the setting, I decide runs a travelling pastry stand with the help of fairy magic. He means no particular ill will to anyone beyond wanting to one-up his sister with his baking skills. Not exactly how his official canon works, but the important part is that he's not particularly combat-oriented, not particularly polarizing of a personality, and not of the age that romancing the recurring cast would cross my (and I hope most people's) mind. Just a fluffy slice-of-life kind of character with potential for growth. So how does the chat react?\n\nHe's mostly ignored. I kid you not, people ignore his free-sample cookies unless there's literally no one else around. This miffs me a little because up until this point it's felt like my characters have been watched like a hawk. Baker is essentially delegated to attempted commentary because very few will even acknowledge him.\n\nWait a second...\n\nI toss in Salt again. _INSTANT HELLFIRE._\n\nI toss in BabyMomma again. _UWU BABY._\n\nI toss in Baker again. _Crickets._\n\n...yeah. I was done with this place. The people who'd been my initial partners had been slowly trickling out of there, and I took it as a sign for me to do the same. I left without a word, and no one from the server cared to confront me about it. What really gets me, though, is how supportive people always were in the OOC channels, and then when it was actually time to play, the same people would treat my characters with such blatant disrespect. Did they lack self-awareness, or were they just bullies? I'm honestly not sure. If they would have just come forward in the beginning and said they didn't want to play darker plots instead of the two-faced gauntlet I was put through, I would still have respect for them. There's nothing wrong with wanting to play feelgood fluff, but if you don't communicate what you want, treating people like trash for not meeting your expectations is, ahem, salt in the wound.\n\n~~On the plus side, last I checked, the server in question has lost like 70% of the membership it had when I left. Lol.~~\n\n**TL;DR** I escape with VampWitch to a chat server, where she's backseat-driven by people who don't even play with her. I abandon her storyline for new character, Salt, who's promptly metagamed and peerpressured into oblivion because \"he's evil\". Exasperated, I try a handful of new characters before realizing I won't ever please anyone there. Rip in pieces.",

            "selftext": "So, normally my partners and I like to portray characters that are slight caricatures of ourselves. For example, one time I had a best-friend roleplay prompt and someone messaged me saying, \u201cBest friend roleplay?\u201d And after I confirmed it, we got right into it and started acting like best friends. I guess it\u2019s kind of like those things you hear where actors and actresses will portray their characters on set even if the camera isn\u2019t rolling. \n\nAnyway, I asked this one girl if she\u2019d be interested in a taboo **roleplay** involving power-abuse and blackmail (note that I would have been on the receiving end of said power-abuse and blackmail). A roleplay, meaning we would take on roles \u2014 not be our actual selves. Little did I know that this individual was a stick-in-a-mud and a SJW. She starts getting super offended, saying that she\u2019s not authorized with powers like that (mind you, she\u2019s a moderator of an establishment which I will leave unnamed out of respect for this sub\u2019s rules) and to never speak to her again. Normally the roleplaying community is not toxic. Yeah, there are those thirsty RPers who will get awkward and creepy. I once had a partner who literally wanted to meet me in person and asked me to have her babies in real life... THAT\u2019S off limits, super creepy and warrants a reaction of the sort (\u201cnever speak to me again\u201d). But over a roleplay prompt request that I wasn\u2019t even forcing upon someone? I even ended it with \u201clet me know if you\u2019re interested\u201d. \n\nAs a good tip, be careful who you send roleplay requests to. You might find the rare occurrence of receiving toxic behavior \u2014 instead of a simple \u201cno thank you\u201d like many others do \u2014 which may leave you in a sour mood. ",
