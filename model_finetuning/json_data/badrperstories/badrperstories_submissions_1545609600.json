            "selftext": "I still don't get why people defend ghosting....\n\nLately it's just putting me in a very depressive state and making me doubt my skills as a roleplayer. Cause your partners refuse to say what's wrong you can't really get a clear idea if it's just them or you and your writing style. Honestly if roleplaying wasn't one of the things I use to cope with stress I'd just drop it altogether as it's quickly losing it's charm!\n\nRoleplay partners deserve respect, I get it some people get busy... but surely you have at least a minute to tell your partners what's up. We don't expect a full blown reply along with \"Hey, I won't be able to reply for a few days/weeks. Hope you don't mind.\" If you tell people what's up, it's likely to prevent them from deleting the rp or removing you off Discord/Skype/Other. Ignoring them just hurts them and can lead them to grow self doubt about their skills as they have no idea if you lost interest or if it's their fault. I've heard the \"But some people react negative to being told the rp's off\" excuse *far* too many times, it's honestly more hurtful to be left in the dark and not knowing if the roleplay is on or not before eventually deleting/removing it and calling it quits as you've been ghosted too many times and you feel that it happened again!\n\nI've been roleplaying for almost 11 years at this point, but only now am I experiencing the ghosting experience! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "I just need to rant, so this will likely be pretty messy, long, and not entirely chronological, but... \n\nSo, I've had a \"main\" RP partner since 2013. Throughout our writing together, we had a lot of highs, but also plenty of lows. In retrospect, it became a pretty toxic relationship that probably should have been nipped in the bud ages ago, but I got spoiled by having someone who already knew my writing style, I knew theirs, we - for the most part - knew each others' boundaries, etc. \n\nAnyway, 2015 rolled around, and I made a fresh batch of characters that eventually came to be my \"mains\" to this day. They're my most developed, most written - essentially my pride and joys. Well, my partner took a great liking to one of them in particular! In the same year I created the character, she started off asking me for permission to write this OC on another forum. On the high of having a character so well-loved, I agreed like a moron. \n\nEventually I expressed my discomfort with the situation (namely when she ceased giving me credit), and she assured me it was fine. It was over for that time. Didn't last long though, as I found her basically copy and pasting all of my characters wherever she could - sometimes with a few minimal differences, but often just outright word-for-word. Even when she wasn't straight up stealing the whole thing, the only other \"original\" character she would make was a knock-off of the one she was COMPLETELY obsessed with (I could ignore *that* though, even if it was annoying.) Or she would copy and paste excerpts from my character sheets, and add them to an otherwise original one of her own.\n\nEach time I called her out, she would profusely apologize and say she'd never do it again. Each time, I'd go along with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, fast-forward to 2018, and due to something unrelated being the tipping point, we've split as partners. And my plans were to completely move on, work on stuff with my new (wonderful) partners, not spare her another thought, no contact. Except, no can do! About a day after we called it quits, she moved on to setting up her own forum. Surprise, surprise, she has one of my OCs posted. Not even for her to play, but for someone *else* to claim. She also posted the character of mine that she's been irritatingly obsessed with for years, so she could write a pairing with one of her own characters that I had indulged her on (also a mistake, because she became obsessed with that too, to the point that it became something of a fictional 'blackmail' situation, in that if I didn't write this ridiculous pairing, she'd stop writing with me as a whole.)\n\nAnd when I say she stole everything, I mean EVERYTHING. Every appearance detail, themes, random ass family member names, personalities, the character names themselves, etc. Like, in this one OCs history, I had a vague outline of their history, but a lot of stuff was secretive. And when she copied it over to hers, she put a few of those details there, but with, like \"for some reason, this happened--\". Because she obviously doesn't even know why, since I never explained them OOC, lmao. It would be hilarious, if it wasn't so annoying to me.\n\nAnyway, after I posted a PSA of sorts to my own forum (this specific community isn't huge, so she'd likely end up inviting people from mine to hers), she ends up posting a \"notice\" on top of the stolen character sheets. Basically read as:\n\n&gt;Was originally created by keen-on-klance, so all credit goes to her. No, she didn't give me permission to use her, this time anyway. Not going to pretend that I'm the original creator or that she gave me permission this time. However, as she has given me permission to use her at least two times prior only to then recant the permission after I had already spent months planning s\\*\\*\\*, I feel no inclination to continue to agree with that recanting. So only my permission is required to claim her on this RP. \n\nSo, pretty much,  \"Hey, I'm using the OC without the owner's permission because I feel like it, and y'all don't need to listen to her!\" \n\nSince she has me blocked on every platform ever, one of our semi-mutual friends messaged her, asking what the hell was up. She told him that I had given her permission in the past, and pointed out a public \"example\" (which wasn't even for an RP, and was under pretty strict restrictions). She called my changing my mind in 2015 on a decision I *made* in 2015, \"random recanting\" - to explain why she doesn't feel she shouldn't be allowed to write them now. \n\nShe also says she doesn't feel it's fair that she has to miss out on the aforementioned pairing she was fucking obsessed with (it \"meant a lot to her\", in her words) just because we aren't writing together anymore. So I guess just because she *wants* to write a relationship with my OC, that entitles her to just... taking that OC? lmao. Whereas I had a handful of interactions I massively enjoyed exploring with her characters... but I'm willing to accept that in not writing with her, I can no longer do so without, you know, stealing. \n\nAlso tells him that she's abiding by my \"no contact\" request, as far as ignoring my email telling her to take my characters down went.\n\nAnyway, I don't really know her endgame for this, because I know for other reasons the RP she's trying to do won't last for long, if go anywhere at all. But no matter the case, I just want her to delete the damn things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",
