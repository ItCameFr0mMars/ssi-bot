            "selftext": "When you're hated on your roleplay blog for your OC  but very well liked on your roleplay blog for a canon and the people who brush you off have no idea you're the person they're so chummy with.   \n\n\nThis wasn't intentional at all. I mentioned on my OC blog that I was gonna make a blog for the canon. I did and ended up deleting both because of anxiety and because I got the impression that I wasn't at all liked. I redid the canon blog and it's flourishing. I redid my OC blog after, feeling more confident, and I get the same treatment as before; like a pariah.   \n\n\nOne of the people who made me feel outcasted (probably not on purpose) has two threads going with me currently. Somebody I hadn't really met before and I have a thread going and we plan on doing a ship as well as having her OC meet the canons son (an oc of mine)  \nWe're getting along very well and I'm getting along with a variety of new people. Very exciting.   \n\n\nWell on my OC blog, I sent a meme starter to the person who's gonna ship with my Canon. She sent the starter, I replied and then this  \n[https://imgur.com/a/RgjDh27](https://imgur.com/a/RgjDh27)  \n\n\nI'm not positive where the age confusion is from because her profile states her age. I also apparently mistook where the RP was taking place and thus chose the wrong version of my OC to use. The person seemed to be fed up already and not willing to sort things out and go from there so I asked if they wanted to cancel and they did.   \n\n\nI'm floored to be honest. Why haven't I told them? Because for once I feel like a fucking normal person on my Canon blog. People actually like me and my character (well my version of the canon). People interact with me and seem happy to do it. Again, this wasn't intentional but once I got a taste of what it was like to be accepted?? How can I ruin that by telling them it's me? I feel bad about it because I quite like these people and I enjoy interacting with them. I fear they will be angry and shun me and go off on  me. I fear that I will lose everything I gained on my Canon blog. I fear I will be even deeper in the pariah hole.   \nBut they'll find out eventually. I just know it. Something will ruin it. And by that time my lie will have gone so far back that I won't be forgivable. They will surely feel utterly betrayed and like I'm a manipulative liar.   \n\n\nI hate to keep this secret but I also hate to be that fan who nobody likes. At the same time, I'm angry because IT'S ME. IT'S ME!!! PLEASE. If you would just wait a second..it's the same person!! The characters are different but it's the same person behind them. You like me as canon..can't you like me as Oc? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm stuck in this accidental lie. I'm not faking the enjoyment when I'm interacting with them as Canon, it's real, but I know in the back of my mind how they feel about me as OC. If I tell them it's me on OC, I don't think they'll suddenly like OC. No, it's more likely they will hate me for keeping this secret.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",
