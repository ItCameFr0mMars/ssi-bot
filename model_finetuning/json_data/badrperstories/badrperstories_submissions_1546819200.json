            "selftext": "I do a lot of superheroes, and superpowered roleplays. From a very early time, I had it beaten into my head that the strongest always wins. \n\nIf my OC can lift X amount of tons, but my partner's OC can lift XX tons, then even if my OC is smarter, faster, and better trained it's just agreed on that their OC would win.\n\nDue to this, I started equating weakness with worthlessness. I didn't want my character's to be in need of rescue or to look like trash compared to someone else's character simply because their character was stronger than mine. So, I started making overpowered characters.\n\nWell I finally realized I had a complex, and where it was coming from, so I have resolved to start feeling more comfortable using my better made, not overpowered OC's because if Batman a guy with no powers, can be one of DC's best heroes, who has the respect of people way stronger than he is, then my characters can do the same in their worlds.",

            "selftext": "I've gotten back into RP more lately after being out of it for a while due to work stress and  medical issues.  The medical issues did not go away, but someone else I love's medical issues got worse, so I'm spending a lot of time loitering in hospital with a phone, an excellent time to type 1000 word RP posts with my thumbs while Dad is resting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy RP ads on my RP account tend to go like this, summarized:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nANCIENT GRAMMAR NAZI RP\n\nHello, I'm looking for someone to roleplay with my bitchy old ass.  I love grammar and syntax and original settings, or maybe Warhammer 40k, I've been into that lately.  I like other old people because they don't ghost as much as college kids.  Have a writing sample.  Here's a prompt.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou'd think that would be pretty obvious, right?  And it does weed out the worst mismatches, mostly.  But in between the potential compatibles, about half the responses I get are like this. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Hello!  I am a person of significant writing talents who is interested in your ad.  Here is my Discord handle.  You might assume from the stilted and slightly inaccurate usageness of my words that my grasp of English it's much less adequate than I believe it is but trust me that is not the case.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI always have to pointedly ask for a writing sample before I hand over my Discord handle.  The result is invariably that their writing is terrible, and they've mistaken \"looking up big words in a thesaurus\" for \"actually knowing how to write fluently.\"  It's even worse when they're trying to write high fantasy, because then they try to use formal diction without knowing how to do that and end up saying things like, \"He did walk slowly down the path, wandering in searching quest of a questing search.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAre there really that many people who don't even *realize* their grammar and syntax is bad?  I get people who don't use commas at all, who use them all over the place as if fired from a shotgun, who can't tell its from it's or their from there.  It's not that they're not native speakers.  I've roleplayed with both a native Dane and a native German and *both* of them had stellar writing skills in English.",
