            "selftext": "This is a rather long story, but I want to tell ya'll about a time some victim blaming asshole completely killed our healthy and active 2 year old server within the matter of a few months. First off, a little background. This group was originally on Skype, but we transferred over to Discord when we got tired of how bad Skype was getting. Despite the transfer, our members were happy with our Admining choices; and we continued to stay active with 8+ ongoing roleplays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe trouble maker, who we will call \"Connwoman\", was even in the group back when it was on Skype. That being said, she wasn't as large of a problem back then. However, I and the other three Admins always had a bad feeling about her. She was very self-centered, always needed to make every OOC conversation about her, would talk about things that she knew upset other people (but bitched if you accidentally even hinted at something she hated), etc. Just every staple of a bad and obnoxious OOC roleplay partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing that sucked is that she was an excellent roleplayer, and she portrayed her character in a way that everyone in the group loved. It's a rare instance of the muse being A+, but the mun being an F-. Because of this (and it was foolish on our part), we gave her a pass. In the group we had a three strike rule policy. If you broke a rule or an Admin needed to speak with you about your behaviour 3+ times, you were banned from the group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of that policy was that we did forgive and remove strikes after a certain amount of time if you behaved and showed improvement. This worked and corrected the behaviour of many group members, and was proven to be effective the 2 years before this member joined. Unfortunately, Connwoman knew and exploited this. She would be on her best behavior after receiving two strikes and said she would change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for a while, we genuinely did believe that she had changed. She showed improvement on all fronts, and was a genuinely pleasant person to interact with. So we took away her strikes. Unfortunately, not even a month after her strikes were taken away, and she started up with the behaviors that had gotten her in trouble in the first place. We started getting complaints from group members that she was making them uncomfortable, and so giving her the benefit of the doubt we talked to her about it (without giving her a strike) since we thought she had genuinely changed and had just relapsed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe put on a fake facade and said something along the lines of: \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry you're right! I was talking to my Mom about seeing a therapist, I think that I'm actually Bipolar. I'm going to get help so I won't keep doing this.\" And of course us being a group of mentally ill Admins with a bunch of empathy, we gave her a pass on her behavior as long as she promised to get help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, she had been in our group for well over half a year. We were a small closed group of about 15 people, so needless to say we were all very close with her and one another. And this is when she began to manipulate people. She manipulated the Admins into thinking we were being to hard on her (and making us feel like assholes), and she manipulated the group members into thinking we were targeting her specifically only to make her miserable because we thought it was a fun, sick game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConnwoman began to slander us behind our backs and make secret closed group servers shit-talking us (telling lies about us too), until a good amount of our members secretly hated us (a lot of them we were originally good friends with for 2.5 years). She took screenshots out of context from our PRIVATE conversations with her, told lies about what we had said to her in voice chat, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part to all of this, was that I had met Connwoman in person. My bestfriend and one other server friend were planning on going to a convention together, and we let other server members know in case they wanted to meet up. Connwoman only lived a state over from the convention, so she decided to go. But the problem was, she decided last minute (literally 4 days before) when we had been planning things for over a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then interjected herself into our plans, and invited herself over to my house (I lived and hour away from the convention center). She then got pissed off the entire weekend when we weren't doing what she wanted to do at all times, and since she was legally a minor (17) we were responsible for her since we were legally adults. It wasn't like we could leave her to do her own thing, especially since we promised her Father (very nice dude, no complaints about him) that we would watch her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bad thing about this is that she told the other members about very personal information after meeting me in person, along with the other two Admins who came. She spread lies about how we ignored her the entire time, and how she felt like we were avoiding her; when it was literally the EXACT opposite of what happened. We even had videos to prove it, though we didn't ever feel we needed to share that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you can imagine our surprise when one month after we went to the con (and had what we THOUGHT was a good time), we caught wind of her shit-talking and slandering us behind our backs (one of the involved group members accidentally slipped up). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had written a 16 page letter to us explaining how we were ruining her life and making her suicidal, for basically not allowing her to do whatever the fuck she wanted in the RP group, and not having her be the center of attention all the time (even if it was making other uncomfortable). You think I'm joking, but that's basically what this \"letter\" boiled down to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first we thought this was just her over thinking things, but then from that one member who slipped up we found out it was a much bigger problem. When we found out what was happening, after a very long conversation and a lot of thought, we banned Connwoman and explained what was happening to the group publicly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, because she had manipulated everyone so heavily, 4 members left with her when she was banned and basically told us all to fuck off (that's a nice way of putting it, they wrote a giant scathing letter and e-mailed it to us calling us every name under the sun). They told us that we were awful human beings and poor excuses for Admins, among other things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey then went to  make a new roleplay group, copying our code and rules list verbatim. The people who joined their group left a few days after joining, because unsurprisingly Connwoman was a horrible admin (and person). One of their rules was literally \"You are not allowed to change the subject on someone in the OOC chat, you need to carry out the conversation on whatever the first person was talking about\". Not joking. That was a rule that she basically made for herself so that she could always keep the conversation on what she wanted to talk about and nothing else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kinda good ending to this is that all 4 members who left our group and were nasty to us all came to us a few months later and apologized. They basically told us they realized what was actually going on, and that they figured out Connwoman was manipulating them. They all ended up feeling horrible, because some of them threw away a 2+ year friendship over baseless slander.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey all had blocked her (within a few months) and were no longer friends. We didn't let any of them back into the group because of how they acted impulsively without the other side of the story, but it was just nice to see that they eventually realized we weren't awful Admins. Conwoman was just a manipulative piece of shit with a victim complex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the group now? It's pretty dead. The roleplays haven't been responded to in over a year, and they're basically just archived now. However, we do still occasionally chat with one another in the OOC chat. It's basically become a chat hub for random things at this point, but at this point? No one cares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a lot more that happened with Connwoman than this, but this is basically a simplified version. And with that, that's the story of how one person alone killed a healthy and active 2 year old roleplay group. Moral of the story here: If you're an Admin, sometimes you need to be a hardass. You can't keep giving your friends a free pass, it'll just cause more issues than it's worth.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm actually a long time lurker, been doing so for like two months or so. Mostly waited until I ran into a significant amount of bad before forming a post, and oh boy! Do I have stories. Anyways. I've just recently gotten into roleplay and have been doing it for two months now, writing for about the same length so, I apologize in advance if my punctuation and the like aren't up to par.\n\nNow onto the subject, my characters. Me as a writer, I am one that looks to write the type of characters one would not typically see on the roleplay scene: heavier set lads that don't look like models, people of varying ethnicities and backgrounds, the disabled just to name a few. And I joined this really sound fantasy roleplay on Kik, literate from what I gathered and with enough open-endedness to allow for nice character creativity... Welp I was wrong. My character of choice was Bob. You see Bob was a simple Pawnbroker's son, more aimed at true neutrality because of his upbringing and philosophy, arguably making him more boring than anything to be honest, he barely did much. But what made Bob special, despite being kind of like some indifferent basement dweller was a mummified hand he touched a few years back-- that bad boy was that of a Demon Lord who in which had cursed him and gave him powers related to, wait for it. *Drum Roll* Rock, Paper, Scissors. Gotta love Game Of Chance Demons. I'll get into the basic crap that power does later. \n\n Now that chat, they did not like that. They never gave a specific reasoning besides \"It just doesn't fit.\" to me, at least not until I had uncovered the reasonings after they removed me. My friend sent screenshots of the admins going on about \"Oh, he would've just made his character win a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with those Demon Hands always.\" this left me absolutely dumbfounded because they not only completely ignored factors like HIS NONEXISTENT BATTLE PROWESS, and the fact I emphasized on him being for a more character driven experience. They ignored the fact he was left literally crippled for five posts if he lost a game and the fact what he gained from winning barely benefited him in the first place. The Demon Hands would basically grant him minimal faster running speed, a low-level magic barrier, and a strength boost to actually make his punches be decent. Yes, they were afraid of this character so much they had to removal me without a proper explanation to my face. \n\nWhat really gets me is that they act like my character was a Godmodder red flag, yep. Because a Godmodder would totally make a character who could not be an absolute badass 24/7 or had powers that weren't easy to abuse, Godmodders totally totally make a character that is meant to grow overtime naturally and the like. It was absolutely dumbfounding, still is! And what's worse about it is that this has happened another few times; hence why I put part 1 up there, not about to hold back now. Going to delve into each and every negative experience I've had besides theses because there's a lot more to come. Thank you for suffering through this and allowing for this to be a place for things like this, you have a good day readers/any possible staff who could be reading this. ",
