            "selftext": "Well, this might not be just the new ones but anyone that doesn't have experience on roleplaying on forum based platform. \n\nIt might sound strange, but there's a really good reason why I'm making this post. \n\nMost forum RP's have a system when it comes to replying and starting threads with someone. It is not expected that anyone replies to your post right away when you post it. Sometimes it can take even weeks before the other party replies. This is fine, forum RP's are a godsend to people who can't push away their real-life and need more time to write their posts. \n\nSo, everytime a speedy joins these communities, it gets a bit weird. What is a speedy then? Well, it's a person who's so eager to start roleplaying that once they get a reply, they will instantly post their own. Why is this a bad thing? It causes stress and messes up the pacing system. And very often, these super fast replies aren't that great in quality. Meaning in addition to it being extremely stressful to RP with a speedy, it's also frustrating and hard.  \n\nSo my advice:\n\nIf you join a forum RP, don't reply right away. Usually, people write multiple drafts before submitting the final version of a post. It's okay if this process takes a few days. In fact, you should probably let your writing simmer for at least one day before submitting it. \n\nIt helps a lot if you observe how other players handle their replies. Sometimes they might get so excited for a particular plot line that everyone submits faster, in these cases - fire away. No one will feel pressured. But if you're the only one doing this, it's time to chill. \n\nBeing fast is not a virtue. ",

            "selftext": "So, this is another story from my time in that Pokemon RP.  The first story can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/a2rwxo/tales_of_the_infallible_sociopath_long/).\n\nThis one comes from the end of the RP's life, in which our admin had driven half of the RPers away in a big stink he'd made over an edit I'd made to a character's image.  I wish I was making this up.  \n\nOne of these players happened to be running an arc where we met several of one of his characters' (Who I'll be calling Rock) family.  People took these characters up with the idea of making the locale we were visiting more populated.  However, the admin had this tendency to hog the spotlight, so he made the family member he took up a literal serial killer.  He was obnoxiously upbeat as a facade to being a murderer.  At the same time, he'd been pushing for another character (Who I'll call Scissors) to get with Rock.  This created a love triangle, that neither of the other two involved were okay with.  \n\nOnce he'd driven Rock's mun away, the arc was concluded off screen and the mun gave the conclusion that Rock had chosen neither of the two love interests.  The admin then decided to do something... *drastic.*\n\nA few days later a google doc pops up, and the Admin tells us to read it.  It was a story where Rock's murderous brother narrates himself date raping Scissors by getting her drunk in explicit detail.  And the kicker is that this literal rapist was just going to come down to where the cast hung out and nobody was allowed to be suspicious of him.  \n\nBut the part about this that genuinely upsets me as a woman:  This was done for the sole purpose of getting Scissors pregnant so she could have a kid.  Hell, in universe it's barely treated like rape, and he claims that it was supposed to be ambiguous whether or not it was rape.  Scissors was drunk and her Rapist wasn't.  That is rape.\n\nThis ordeal killed any respect that I had for the Admin and helped me realize that he was a selfish misogynistic piece of garbage.  I've washed my hands of him",
