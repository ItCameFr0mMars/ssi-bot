There has been a wave of new members after I joined and I noticed something that worries me quite a bit. \n\nNobody is getting ghosted - except for me. \n\nAt first, I thought this was because I was new, but now that we've been having new members I noticed that this isn't the case. I'm the only one that is left hanging when it comes to replies and it sucks. \n\nI get really involved in the plots that we plan together with my partners and they seem to be enthusiastic in the beginning too. Then they just... Stop replying after a few posts.\n\nI think it's got something to do with my writing, I'm not a native English speaker but I'd like to think my posts are at least readable.\n\nI don't want to post my writings here because I don't want to get recognized.  But what are the things that make RPing with someone a chore for you? ",

            "selftext": "One girl joined our group a few weeks ago, let's call her Fiona for the sake of clarity. \n\nFiona is generally a pretty nice girl, she's polite, kind, a bit of in the shy side. Really enthusiastic and actively tries to contribute in the group conversations. Nothing wrong with her personality. She does have a habit of trying to insert herself into every single conversation but I think she's doing this because she wants to fit in.\n\nFiona is not a native English speaker, she's also dyslexic. Alone, this wouldn't be a problem but she has a few quirks that make her a bit annoying to roleplay with. \n\nHer character is a checklist of \"common RP character mistakes\". A young, naive girl who has no experience of the outside world. She's weak, socially awkward and has daddy issues. Fine, not a big deal alone.\n\nBut her writing style is... awful. It's not bad bad, she is relatively literate and I think she writes novels too. \n\n\"  She was talking too fast, stuttering and losing her words.\"\n\n\" \\[the NPC name\\] started at her, the look of disdain on his face only growing. \"\n\nBasically, the issue is with her strange sentence structure. I can't post longer excerpts so that it wouldn't be too recognizable but the structure is always like this.\n\n\"Short sentence. A short sentence, pointless adverbs and action. Large ass sentence littered with adverbs and pointless rambling.\"\n\nShe also keeps hashing out words like \"trying\" \"was\" \"to be\" \"also\" \"like\" \"seem\", basically just low-literate fanfiction writing. \n\nFiona is super fast at her replies too. And her posts are so goddamn long and bad. I honestly don't understand how she even writes that fast. She does have good ideas, they just don't translate well into her writing. For example, sometimes she manages to capture her character in this amazingly sweet and cute way, then in the next part, we are reminded how annoying she is. \n\nIs there any hope that she will actually get better? Because right now it's exhausting to RP with her. ",

If you have practiced writing for ten years it doesn't mean you are a good or even decent roleplayer. Hell, you can even be published author and still suck at roleplaying. \n\nStorytelling for your own amusement is different. There, you can write your characters to be however you want them to be. You can plan their stories in advance and have them have whatever weird, quirky characteristics you can imagine,\n\nYou.Can't.Do.That.In.Roleplay!\n\nDon't create \"amazing\" character and plan their storyline from start to finish. The chances are, nothing of that will ever happen. Especially if that's your first character in that particular game. If you try to push storylines that center around YOUR character, people will be annoyed. You need to plan the plots so that it benefits and takes into account the other characters too. You can't plan what you want YOUR character to do, you need to plan what might be interesting for the other characters. \n\nIn fact, every time someone who's new to roleplaying joins in and says that they do creative writing/are working on their own novel, it's a big oh no.
