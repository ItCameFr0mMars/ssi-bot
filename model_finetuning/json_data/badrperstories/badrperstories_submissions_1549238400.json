            "selftext": "I don't want to complain since this person has generally been nice to RP with and they seem to have some real-life issues that might affect their ability to RP.\n\nIn my post, my character dropped some pretty hefty knowledge on the other character that was supposed to move the dialogue and the scene forward. My partner was also obviously building up for this specific thing to happen so when they decided to ignore it I was really confused. \n\nBasically, it's just my character giving away really crucial information and my partner's character just... continues to carry on as nothing happened. No reaction at all, they just continue their mundane chit-chat that was used to build up the scene. And they didn't mention that piece of dialogue in the character's internal dialogue or anywhere really, so my partner obviously didn't see it. Which leads me to believe they didn't actually read my post because if they had, there is no way they would have missed it.\n\nSo how do I respond to this? Do I make my character wonder why they were ignored or do I just pretend that didn't happen? Maybe I should mention this to my partner, but I reeeally don't want to nag or pressure them. What do you do in situations like this?",

            "selftext": "This is more because it's funny now rather than a vent, but I am pretty curious if this was common for other people since it happened so ridiculously frequently for me growing up.\n\nI suppose in more or less chronological order this happened in [Unichat](http://www.unichat.com/) (RIP), on forums where the liars were pretty quickly discovered via IP, but the most gregarious example I remember was on Facebook (lol).\n\nI'm not proud of the fact I used to Facebook roleplay, but an in-person friend got me into it when we were around 16. I personally always RP'd OCs and almost exclusively with other OCs before my behavior devolved into trolling all the surprisingly self important roleplays on that platform--so I wasn't directly involved, but said friend was.\n\nSo, there was this one girl who RP'd as Aizen from Bleach (lol) and I'm guessing that character is rather central to the show because the Bleach roleplayers kind of revolved around her. My friend was one of them and apparently really wanted her character and this Aizen dude to hook up but Aizen-RPer just kind of wanted to get attention from all the thirsty community members so really just ERP'd with everyone, all without changing her character's Facebook status relationship (the horror!).\n\nOnly one shining example of not-thirst stood out; an RPer who played as some side character, very marginal. I want to say she was named Loli but I'm not going to Google that for obvious reason. No, Loli was hot for some OTHER Bleach character who I think was an OC (just looked like an edgelord, whited out version of the main guy). But it turns out his player was some like, 15 year old who was gay IRL and wasn't very interested in 'Loli'. However, after weeks of harassment they became 'Facebook official' only to break up a few days later.\n\nAizen-chan would often post OOC that Loli's RPer was going through a tough time and that she often stayed up all night comforting her and to please leave her alone. Maybe a day later Aizen brought us the solemn news that Loli was in the hospital and they just so happened to live near one another and she often went to visit her. Days, maybe weeks of updates passed with Loli's condition dipping and improving depending on what garnered the most drama but when that well ran dry, Aizen *then* informed us that Loli had died.\n\nOf 'Broken Heart Syndrome'.\n\nNot only this but Aizen-chan saw fit to blame OC-kid almost directly, thus turning the formidable Facebook Bleach Roleplaying Community against him. Poor guy was ostracized.\n\nMy friend in particular was distressed over this. In the past, her character (male, idr who--he was short with black hair) had been in a relationship with another IRL friend's character (the guy with the teeth). Guy-friend was straight but crazy about my friend so engaged in fictional homolust with her via their characters whenever she'd let him--but Guy-friend eventually succumbed to his straight depravity and 'cheated' on friend's character with Loli. Like, right on their Facebook wall--I remember 'Loli' squishing her boobs together and asking Teeth guy if he approved; and also Teeth Guy telling Loli she felt so much better than '[friend's character]'s butt'. LOL.\n\nFriend used this obvious meta knowledge to 'break up' with Guy-friend (in a huge scene where friend outed Teeth Guy as the bottom in their relationship) and apparently the backlash over this was the secondary reason for Loli's fatal Broken Heart Syndrome. So my friend was ridden with guilt. Me, the grizzled internet RP veteran assured her this was all bullshit and that Aizen-chan was lying but my friend wasn't so sure.\n\nSo I told OC-guy to message Loli's account saying how he realized he loved her and that if she were back alive he'd marry her, etc. \n\nAnd she took the bait.\n\nSuddenly Loli had been alive this whole time and Aizen-chan was indeed the one who faked her death online by 'hacking' her FB by changing the password while she lie dying in the hospital. The gullible ass community turned on Aizen-chan except for my thirsty friend who defended her tooth and nail. They became close and exchanged IRL phone numbers but their characters never hooked up much to my friend's chagrin.\n\nFinally, Aizen-chan accidentally posted a status meant for her main character to Loli's account and for some reason *that's* what convinced everyone.\n\nSo that's my tale of fail; anyone have anything similar?\n\n**tl;dr: Bleach roleplayer makes two accounts and pretends one of them died OOC of something stupid because she didn't get her way IC and then reveals the secondary one to be alive, accusing the first one of hacking until she misclicks and reveals her duplicitous nature. Nobody hooks up with who they wanted.**",
