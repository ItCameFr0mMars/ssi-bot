            "selftext": "Around the timeline of 2010 to about late 2015 I role played on a certain site. a site that at the time seemed to have been booming with roleplayers because I have checked back in the recent years and it seems like it's died down a lot.\n\nNow my venting here is not against one particular person because it could honestly apply to just about every freaking person I met there. \n\nI'm clearly exaggerating a little bit, because there were genuinely a few people that I could literally count on one hand that I had no issues with at all, but for the most part I had certain grievances with everyone.\n\nWhen I put it that way it makes it sound like I'm the one who had the problem which maybe I was.\n\nAnyway, I did a lot of superhero roleplay and I'm going to get everything off my chest that I've been holding him for a while now.\n\n1. I was never respected when I was the administrator of a forum. Anytime I was on someone else's for him they were completely respected. Their word was law. Whatever they say absolutely went and no one had a problem with it. \n\nWhenever I ran a forum though people would constantly argue with me, they would try to undermine my authority, and in one particular case a person on my forum with no power whatsoever literally told me that he was not going to allow me to use a character that I made because he deemed them to be too powerful despite the fact that we were roleplaying in a universe where people like Superman exists and my character was only about Spider-Man level.\n\n\nLet me say that one more time. My own forum. We were doing a superhero Universe where people as strong as Superman exists, and I the administrator was told by another role player that I could not use my Spider-Man level character!\n\n\n2. And this brings me to my honest to God biggest problem with doing group roleplay with superheroes. Especially from that site. No matter how weak I made a character it was never enough. I could have someone that was literally Batman level but without all the gadgets or super intelligence, and would still be told that though they sounded a little too powerful.  \n\nOf course when their friends made a character that can warp reality on a universal scale they never said anything about that.\n\n3. Low effort forums always had the most attention. I could spend hours making my forum look as perfect as possible... And someone who whip there's up in 5 minutes would have over a thousand posts by the next day. \n\n\nI guess all in all I can't complain too much because if all of that had not happened to me I would not have realized how much I loved one on one roleplaying. After going through everything that I did on that site and making the switch from group roleplay to single roleplay I have been so much happier.  I am very thankful for the solo partners I have today, but because of the experience of that site I will not ever join a group again.\n\nAs a final note on this the guy who told me I could not have my own character on my own forum we have for the most part buried the hatchet between us but I've got to be honest I kind of want an apology. That never happened. I doubt that it will, but on some level it would be really nice, to get a message from him one day saying; \"Hey, I'm sorry. that was your character, and your forum and it was wrong of me to try and undermine you and tell you that you couldn't play your own character.\"\n\nAgain I'm probably never going to receive an apology from him but yeah it would be nice to get one.\n\nAlso not necessarily an apology but I would like an explanation from these two girls that were super nice to me for a little bit and then all of a sudden just started ignoring me. \n\nThat concludes today's vent.",

            "selftext": "Now. This is pretty much my first post in this sub\u2014 which has entertained me more than once I admit, but this time I ought I'd go ahead and wipe that dust off some past experiences in my roleplaying career. Most of it focused on a 'Dragon Ball Z' site. It's been *so* long but I could still rant about it day and night.  \nI have spent about a year and a half, maybe two, on this site. So, I will be posting parts of it in different posts whenever I have some free time. Given there's just *so much* I could write about and how overwhelming it'd be to put it all together in one, huge post. Now.  \nLet's begin right away saying that I have joined the site in June 2015. The site had already been going for a year or so, there were lots of characters that had already established themselves on the site. Honestly? My first impression was quite decent. There were more than eighty members online every twenty-four hours and furthermore, the chatbox was also active (which I've only later realized it was not necessarily a good thing) and people looked decent.  \nIt is also important for you guys to know how the site worked, though. It was a statless website, for the most part, but it used one global stat that was Power Level\u2014 you would do threads, finish them and put them in a thread to have mods review them and grade by your Word Count \\* Quality Score + ( 1 \\* Other Modifiers like Weights, Gravity, etc. ). That was the formula, more or less. So, you would eventually grow in 'PL' and be able to access each race's transformations as you progressed; Super Saiyan was at 100k PL and required an 'emotional trigger'.  \nHowever. I did not know what actually laid beneath all of this. Let's begin right away with this: there was a lengthy number of staff members. For the sake of privacy, we will call each one of them differently: first is Gorilla, who is the owner of the website. He used to play a female Saiyan that battled for the title of Queen and achieved Super Saiyan through a deadly battle for the throne. So far nothing wrong, right?  \nThen, we have Tu-tu\u2014 He played an androgynous Android who used to lead the Blue Banner Army and later became the President of Earth.  \nFor the sake of simplicity, we will only introduce only one more staff member among the other plenty\u2014 even though there'd be a lot of stuff to talk about when it comes to the whole group. But, for this post, I will limit myself to my first bad experiences here. We will call this one Kay. She played a homosexual Saiyan hybrid who acted pretty much like a dick\u2014 both IC and OOC to everybody, even those she had befriended both out and in-character.  \nI had just created a typical Saiyan. I was very inexperienced in roleplay back then, so I decided to limit myself with something very simple to just start and get a feeling. Thing is; I grew bored. I had at first met and threaded with someone whose character was just so edgy\u2014 the classic hired assassin but with the worst grammar I had read in a while and that offered some poor excuses to just fighting my character because mine had a lower power level and he apparently felt like winning a battle given he was made fun of because of how weak his assassin was.  \nI left the website because the thread was that boring I just lost interest in Dragon Ball Z RP. Until I showed up once more in October of the same year. There, I met one of my soon-to-be friends who I keep in touch with to this day and I will call him Soy. Now, the latter had been created his character not too later than I did but compared to me, this guy actually put his heart and soul into writing out his character. He had a certain backstory about him being terrified and disgusted by Tuffles because of his late Saiyan heritage\u2014 this guy had also written a lot of solo threads and played a lot with the gravity chamber which allowed him to get a significant boost and quickly equal, if not, ahead of many others.  \nBy the time I had joined, Soy was already around Super Saiyan 2 level. The thing is, though, this website was full of 'circlejerks'; mainly it involved the entire staff team. As Gorilla, Tu-tu and Kay pretty much \"*cut*\" at Soy with subtle comments in the chatbox every now and then\u2014 almost making fun of him because Soy practiced kendo and that he was just a student while \"*his master was a woman*\"\u2014 which is not only stupid but also sexist. Mind you, I am not even all that annoyed about the latter but it's just so stupid to make fun of somebody because their teacher is a woman in a martial art or anything alike.  \nSo, you can understand the kind of people they were.  \nIs that all? No. Back when I joined, the Queen\u2014 *Gorilla* had planned a full-out assault to conquer Earth and get the Dragon Balls to revive her dead child. But Soy did not wish to take part in this, because regardless of his loyalty to the Empire and rough ways, he was not willing to slaughter a race of '*weaklings*'. So, Gorilla tricked Soy ICly to believe that Humans were actually the successors of Tuffles through some evidence manipulation and so, the Earth invasion carried out smoothly.  \nHow did this work? The website had a factor called '*Death-Enabled*' which could be either used by members in 'Closed' threads for personal/private duels... because normally, you couldn't just kill a character without their permission unless the thread was death-enabled. And then, there were *Open Death-Enabled* threads which mostly involved the destruction of a specific board on the forum or a Saga just like this invasion. So, this 'DE'\u2014 as we will call it lasted about two or three months.  \nWhat happened? Soy's in-character mate was about to die and to save her, his fear allowed him to trigger the *Super Saiyan 2* form. He did save her, but he also happened to face Earth's strongest defender: a homosexual Bio-Android with a tail that probably had more uses than one. Which, I am not personally implying but she has stated multiple times before in innuendos. However, Soy was a gentle Saiyan and the player wished to give him an alignment change and rather join with the Earthlings as he learned the truth of Gorilla's fake evidence. Therefore, he simply calmed down and left the Death-Enabled thread with his mate.  \nThe results of this were... *a total* catastrophe. Out of character, to be precise. The admins began picking on him daily in chatbox; every time I'd come home and check out the website, I'd find Soy in an argument with the mods that had cut at him with some snide comment about how he could not roleplay his character right and that he shouldn't have been the first Super Saiyan 2 of the site. He was pretty much bullied by the mods that described him as a \"power gamer\". And this wasn't only directed to him, but his friends as well, even if they had done nothing wrong. His friends were accused of being involved with him in a clich\u00e8.  \nThey were being so isolated, that at some point, the website staff team proposed to change the Power Level system into a \"Tier system\" where staff would have divided the community in tiers depending on the website's saga arc. That would have basically given the staff full control of at which rate and speed someone would have progressed on their website. Obviously, this turned into a full-out war as the staff team posted an actual thread about it\u2014 Soy and his friends quickly felt called out because they **KNEW** and it **WAS** obvious that any of this was happening because of how fast Soy had grown in the span of months. He had joined when Gorilla was a Super Saiyan and in those few months, his character had become the website's first Super Saiyan 2 which did rub off people the wrong way. Who? Gorilla and Kay. They HATED that neither of them had accomplished such before him. Which, I will also mention by the end of the post because they will give concrete proof of their resentment.  \nBut yes, this Dragon Ball Z staff team was obsessed with control; there was another friend of mine... I'd like to call Pink\u2014 he was a Saiyan-Human hybrid and one of the few quality roleplayers that posted a lot because of the plenty stories and fun plots he usually managed to gather together with other people. He was also progressing at too much of a faster pace so that the staff team called him out in front of everybody else in the chatbox telling him: \"*Uhm dude, chill out with the posts. You're growing too much. Do not post for a week or so.*\"  \nLike; *are we serious*? You're literally asking one of your most active and excited members to stop posting? I don't know. That's not how you run a site, at least in my opinion.  \nSo, at some point, Soy and his friends decided to actually get the hell out of that website and make their own DBZ RP; it was heavily based off the systems and the story of the original one, but with a few tweaks and new features. But, Gorilla's jimmies were rustled: he had gone so angry that he decided to contact his lawyers to reach out to the new DBZ RP's hosting service and attempted to pull a **DMCA** over his '*copyrighted* content'. This guy actually had the courage to state that the things he had written on a forum roleplaying website were 'copyrighted'\u2014 and not only that, because in the end, the forum was based on *Dragon Ball Z*, therefore it wouldn't even be his property at best, but even claimable by the franchise's owners if so they wished. Not to mention; they actually legit tried to make them shut down for the dumbest reasons.  \nOne of the elements that Gorilla pointed out to be stolen was the \"Oozaru\" transformation; but not the form itself which is simply the Great Ape that Saiyans can transform into when the full moon is out\u2014 no, literally the **OOZARU** name. These poor guys had to change it to Great Ape because they couldn't keep Oozaru even if it's just *the original Dragon Ball Japanese name* for Great Ape. Again, that is a huge mistake on the hosting service itself for even agreeing with Gorilla on that one, but still, it's so stupid for it to have been considered in the first place.  \nIn the end, Soy's site moved on and did its thing and so did the 'Rustle DBZ RP'\u2014 which is how I like to call it, even though they have never moved on from Soy's time on the website. The proof is a conversation that happened months later where members were asking if there had been any Super Saiyan 2 yet and both Gorilla and Kay denied it. One of the older members, though, did mention Soy but Gorilla and Kay made sure to censor him as quickly as possible, basically trying to erase his time on the website and at the same time, throwing dirt on his name as they called him *a loser* and *a shitty roleplayer*.  \nAnd with this, I'd like to end this first post about this website in particular. And if you think any of this was bad, wait until I tell you more about \"Gorilla\" himself in the posts to come. Because trust me, there's plenty to tell.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I've been RPing for about a year and a half now, and thought I'd come and share some of the interesting people I've come across during that time. The stuff I do is for the most part pretty literary, or has become so over time, and based in the Warhammer 40k universe.\n\nFor the record, I've met a lot of cool people as well, and while most of these guys were chill otherwise, some of their tendencies were just downright infuriating. \n\n**The Master of Asspulls**\n\nThis guy was a pretty good writer, had cool ideas and was pretty fun OOC. We were friends and did stuff together for a pretty long time. But he also asspulled.\n\nA lot.\n\nYou see, in 40k old tech is rare, powerful and extremely valuable. But this guy would just pull out some of it whenever he needed it - or even just because. Sure, it made for cool stories now and then. But when your character seems more like a swiss army knife of gadgets than anything else, it becomes a bit ridiculous. To add to that, the explanations were flimsy at best and \u2018lol idk\u2019 at worst. \n\n**Creepy the Admin**\n\nCreepy was the admin of the first RP I ever joined, and man, is this a tale. He did much of the DMing there, but for some reason the only threads he'd finish were the ones that included his kid NPCs.\n\nThere were a lot of those. \n\nGuardsmen came across orphans on battlefields, Space Marines got servants that were four of five years old to help maintain their gear\u2026 at some point a small child wandered into the lair of one of the chaos characters, only to be brutally sacrificed in a ritual. They also tended to end up in... weird situations.\n\nNow, when I started I wasn't particularly aware of how *weird* it got, so when my character came across the inevitable orphans, he helped out. Later down the line one of the orphans - a six year old girl - ran off, only to end up in a brothel where she watched people doing what people in brothels tend to do. Back then I considered the scene somewhat creepy and uncomfortable, but didn't pay it much mind. Only later did I learn later that a *lot* of the kid NPCs seemed to end up in weirdly sexual situations. \n\nFor example did he insert himself into genuine ERP threads to have these kid characters walk in on whatever was going on. Not cool, man. Not cool.\n\n**The Living Meme**\n\nThis guy is a special case. He was chill as a person, but man, was he a pain to RP with at times. He ticked a lot of the bad RPer boxes: characters lacked initiative, were based around a single quirk, or would do things that made literally zero sense, OOC or IC.\n\nOver time he realized that people became wary of doing stuff with him. Not surprising, seeing how he barely stuck with a character for longer than a month, or with a plot he proposed to people for longer than a few posts. When he asked for help with solving those problems, the group he hung out with OOC of course tried to help. We helped brainstorm character ideas or plots, gave feedback to his posts, to his arcs and to a lot of the stuff he did. He seemed to understand, implemented some of the help\u2026 and then went back to his old ways a week later.\n\nThe result was easy to guess: very few people liked to interact with him. He'd come back to us again, asked for help again, received it\u2026 and forgot all about it a few days later. It happened a few more times, and to be honest got quite frustrating. So after a few months of this, most of us grew weary of trying to help him out. \n\nWhen our entire group switched places, our new RP got a lot more serious and so of course characters had to be more serious and lore abiding than they'd been before. That turned out to be a bit of a problem for this guy. He'd make something, ignore lore in the process and proceed to create something that was little more than a meme. The staff and other users would go and help him improve it to meet the server's standards. He'd start playing it\u2026 and instantly do something nonsensical. \n\nAnd then he'd get offended when someone called him out on it, or people simply didn't want to join him.\n\nLet me give you the highlight that eventually had a big part in getting him banned:\n\nMy main character is well known for not getting along with a certain faction, to the level where the character's hatred for that faction is a well known OOC joke and has been for some time. This guy was around when it started and I know for a fact that he's familiar with my character's hateboner. \n\nHe went to make a character of that faction, which in and of itself is no problem at all. He asked if his char could join my char's faction IC, to which I said something along the lines of, \u2018Sure, if you can convince him IC. It's gonna really be difficult'. He was cool with that. So far, so good.\n\nThe next day I came back to find that he'd posted his character application. It had a few issues in terms of lore, and in that it was the reboot of one of his old character, which would have made interactions with anyone that'd met the previous incarnation of the character super awkward, but those were not the main issues.\n\nYou see, in our RP it's common for players to command entire armies of NPCs. Sometimes other players will create PCs to join those armies, but it's relatively rare. Common sense also dictates, that it'll have to *always* happen with the owner's permission. Not doing that is incredibly rude. This guy had ignored all that, told the mods I was cool with it, and essentially written the character as an existing member of my group.\n\nIt obviously didn't get allowed and he got chewed out over it. \n\n**Muh Autohit**\n\nThis guy was an interesting case as well. He was chill OOC, his characters were interesting, but he was also an absolutely horrible powergamer. The first time I met him, I was a staff member on a server, and leader of the biggest chaos faction. He planned to launch an ork invasion of the chaos base.\n\nSo far, so good\u2026\n\n...at least until he simply wrote his orks slaughtering every single cultist around our lair and autohit-killed a few characters. Of course without clearing it with the players. It was retconned for obvious reasons, but since there was a *massive* power imbalance between the combined forces of 8 chaos players and this one ork - a few hundred cultists and forty Chaos Space Marines against a tide of thousands of orks with warmachines and monsters - we had a bit of a problem.\n\nSo, using my mod powers, I allowed the daemon summoner to summon a big bunch of daemons via rituals to even the odds and give Chaos a fighting chance at least. It worked, until the ork guy autohit-killed them over the course of a single post. The staff then had *another* discussion with Mr. Autohit, which seemed relatively successful. There was some more retconning and suddenly it seemed like daemon guy and ork guy had a cool battle going on that both enjoyed.\n\nSuccess, you'd probably say. Believe it or not, I thought so too.\n\nSadly I was wrong. There was one more problem. My player character was stuck on the surface of the planet, with a large tide of orks coming his way. So Mr. Autohit and I got into a thread that was my dude running away from orks. After a few shenanigans, my guy came across a daemon that he ended up fighting. It was a cool scene and a fun fight. Then, when it seemed like my character was about to best this NPC daemon, the daemon's sword suddenly simply phased through all his defenses and out of nowhere - I'm sure you guessed it - autohit-killed him.\n\n*Sigh.*\n",

            "selftext": "We're back at this again, very shortly from the first post because you all apparently loved it. So I thought I'd share my knowledge on what happened later. Because, yeah, we're still talking about that very same Dragon Ball Z site. Back in the days, after the whole Soy split and all, I was somewhat on the verge between both sites but I pretty much stayed active on the first and original website. Now, what happened is that I was basically wandering and randomly threading with people until I happen to meet my next soon to befriend who I'll call... Rapper. My boy over here played a Namekian who wished to visit his home planet\u2014 and he was also part of one of the website's most inspiring factions... because yes, there were a few factions; Z-Fighters, Blue Banner Army, Saiyan Solar Empire and etc. Rapper was part of the Galactic Patrol.\n\nAt first, we were just having our fun but then, he also invited me to the Galactic Patrol and I accepted pretty much because of the possible plots. So, before we could even get anything IC done, I was invited into this Skype chat and oh boy; the amount of gossip and shit-talking was so great that it became almost funnier than the actual roleplay. Mostly because back in the days I wouldn't ever notice the drama that happened on the website, while on the chat I could at least learn about it pretty quickly.\n\nFrom this, I'd say to talk about... Winds. A teenage girl who apparently had every disease that ever existed and even the ones that don't exist, honestly. She once listed all her illnesses and it was something like... three lines of several words and scientific terms related to diseases. She played a \"pregnant\" female Saiyan who was rejected by her parents because of her mate not having been... 'recognized' or blessed by the family. That, itself was cringe as hell. But what happened is that Winds lost her fucking child every two threads and then she'd get pregnant again the next thread. How? She basically tried to hit on every male character, but since she'd be pregnant already, she'd have her fetus die because of some random reason so that the guy she was flirting with could be the next dad. Yeah. What the fuck.\n\nWhat happened is that Gorilla sincerely called her out for being 'retarded' even in public. But Winds never gave attention to insults like those somehow and simply ignored it. In Gorilla's own opinion: 'She's too retarded to even understand that I was insulting her.'\n\nRapper was also one of those people who didn't take well to Winds, but he had never come that far. He simply ignored her or said some sneaky comment to her stuff in the chatbox. But, unfortunately, at the time Gorilla was on a whole different level. He had apparently been having problems being recognized as a 'leader figure' or rather, being appreciated as one. He knew people didn't like him, but he responded with atrocity and oppression.\n\nOnce, in order to advance HIS plots, he decided to plan a time skip for the whole website\u2014 which a few people agreed to, while the majority was shocked because most of their plots would have been crushed down and forcedly needing to take another turn, for the better or the worst. Gorilla did not like their denial, so, one afternoon, in front of everyone, he began criticizing people in the chatbox calling them out for their: \"Shitty personal plots that are not as important as the website's story plot!\" *(which oddly enough match with his plot... wonder why) \u2014* That's not all, even.\n\nHe let out to that period's frustrations as he began snapping and suddenly he changed his avatar to the one of a gorilla, calling out the member base for being a bunch of 'unappreciative fucks' who defined him as a rustled gorilla. One old friend of ours, from the Galactic Patrol, I'd like to call this time... Lad\u2014 he came on the chatbox all chill-like, without any means to offend Gorilla with this statement: \"Bro, calm down... you high man?\"\n\nI will simply *quote* the admin's response: \"Are you an asshole who just insinuated that I do drugs?\"\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, now, how about we move away from the drama a bit and introduce some more people that will play a part in all of what is come to next, yeah? I would say to begin with the Galactic Patrol's leader: FeelyWheely. He's one of the most chill people I have met on the Internet. He played a human character that trained intensely and almost became the strongest Human on the website\u2014 surpassed in such by only another mod, which I will call... Soldout\u2014 the latter also played a Human and *probably* was assisted in his Power Level growth as he raised quickly to high levels. But if anything, FeelyWheely was only to be respected for his dedication to being the second strongest Earthling at least.\n\nThen we have... the Spanish Inquisition. Regardless of the weird nickname, he's quite also a chill guy; and became who I consider my best friend to this day. He plays furries, mostly, and therefore also played one on this Dragon Ball Z website. He was also in the Galactic Patrol and that's how we met.\n\nLast, I'd say to introduce just this one guy: LightsaberMaster. This dude is actually something; a weeaboo to his finest, but that's not even the problem, the thing is that he is both that and also a fuckboy. So many times he tried to hit on a character of a married woman IRL, who also roleplayed with her husband... which was uncomfortable as hell. LightsaberMaster is called such, because he was in the Galactic Patrol, and therefore in our Skype. Once we had a video call and he showed off his plastic lightsaber, shoving it around. Before you ask, he is something like 20+. Yeah.\n\nLightsaberMaster had multiple issues with the website prior to this time period, before I was even around. He used to roleplay the classic good Saiyan, but he was nowhere like Goku. He was a typical good protagonist anime character with zero depth and even if he had any, it probably just showed when he was threading with a girl. This guy was quite something because he wished to be recognized as the King of Saiyans... but also become the King of Namek. Which did not make any goddamn sense? Supposedly, he'd have had to conquer Namek first. But he basically wanted to be recognized by the Namekians first before taking the Saiyan throne. I don't get it to this day, honestly. But either way, the staff told him how dumb he was \u2014*probably the one thing they did right in their lifetime\u2014* Not to mention that he basically snapped and fought staff openly, especially Kay. The latter was quite blunt and honestly, if you weren't related to her character, to her you basically meant nothing and were just as useless in her opinion. Kay was basically quick to tell him to fuck off and eventually, the two basically earned a warning together.\n\nThe website had a warning system in percentages: from 5% to 100% basically.\n\nLightsaberMaster was banned for some months, while Kay got off smoothly. Ah. Did I mention that Kay stated to be a transexual girl in real life? I've heard plenty of times that Kay might have used this on the staff to make them pity her and promote her to the moderator rank\u2014 and personally, I feel like that the girl flirted with Gorilla on Skype or something like that. Given how much Gorilla defended her.\n\nBut either way, the Master of all Lightsabers and seven Katana styles came back eventually as a member of Frieza's race. Of course, though, this guy was another good fuckboy all around. A pure-hearted Frieza that was born from an ordinary egg... even if he eventually retconned that deep within him laid the spirit of his former character\u2014 which was also dumb given DBZ doesn't work like that. One could argue about Uub and reincarnation but the way he roleplayed things, the spirit itself was still there... actually as a *vision/voice/ghost*, so yeah. That doesn't make sense to this day. And he joined the Galactic Patrol.\n\nWe all hated him, just saying.\n\nBut yeah, basically, there was this thing about Rapper and LightsaberMaster. They couldn't get along, at all. Maybe it was a matter of first impressions or behavior, but honestly, the two clashed on about everything; the thing is, it wasn't Rapper that clashed, but LightsaberMaster basically *forced* an argument out of everything. Like, Rapper had come back from a film once and he was like: \"Meh, it isn't all that much...\"\u2014 Quickly, his archnemesis responded with some fast ass keyboard typing shit in caps lock. \"DUDE ITS A GREAT FILM YOUR TASTES SUCK WTF\".\n\nAnd from there, hour-long arguments started in the Skype chat about films or whatnot that LightsaberMaster did not agree on with either Rapper or somebody else's opinion.\n\nNow, let's go back to our boy Gorilla. One night, he was basically asking somebody to talk to over in a private Skype chat\u2014 Rapper and I offered as we were invited and we quickly found herself a venting Gorilla who would go on about his problems with the website. Members that would be acting like *entitled assholes*, simply because they did not all cheer for the time skip occasion and because there were people like Winds that in his opinion didn't even know how to write a character, to begin with\u2014 in a certain sense, we were talking like friends almost.\n\nAnd we kind of gave him some tips and told him to chill a bit. He seemed to take it well, too.\n\nIf only.\n\nThere was something or rather someone who would happen to act like a dick: LightsaberMaster. He was in our Galactic Patrol Skype chat, so he basically had access to any log of us shit-talking the majority of staff members whenever they did or said something stupid. But he wouldn't have had reasons to actually leak them all, because he was also involved in said conversations. Thing is, at the time our boy FeelyWheely was actually a moderator on the website. The only good one, honestly. True, he did leak the grading formula to us but he was seriously an *incredible* mod; he was grading threads left and right because, given the site's activity, the review thread for rewards would get crowded in little time: it honestly went all the way up to two or three pages worth of individual members' threads. The thing is, even if there was an abundance of staff members I have not mentioned before, nobody of them actually did staff work. They just posted with their characters and for a certain period of time, our boy FeelyWheely was the only guy who took on three whole pages worth of multiple threads to be graded and reviewed\u2014 and rewarded. At first, we had tried to convince Tu-tu to make his work lighter or at least get more staff members... his response was basically: *Nah, this is pretty normal. He's fine taking on all those threads.*\n\nHe basically told us that he had to work it out as *a slave*, basically and that it didn't matter whether or not the other staff members helped him.\n\nEven though, admittedly FeelyWheely at least became loved in the community given he was the only guy who graded their threads. But he was getting tired, honestly. His roleplaying time was getting more limited and eventually, though, Gorilla was done annoying him. Because, at some point, he was basically *around* Super Saiyan 2 level but not quite there yet, but he also had a formidable item: the Tree of Might. It was an item you could place on a planet and harvest it to produce fruits you could consume to permanently increase your power level. The tree would also happen to slowly kill the planet over the course of a total turns of the automatic Death-Enabled thread. Obviously, only one person could possess said item... and it was Gorilla. Surprise surprise?\n\nWell, it was planted on Kanassa. It spawned fruits every now and then; Gorilla ate most of them and passed some other down to his faction members, but what mattered is that Gorilla finally reached the requirement for Super Saiyan 2 given the Power Level he had received from the fruits' boost. Now, it is important to know that this website's staff hated people that pre-planned things such as emotional triggers for transformations. Whoever tried would basically be either warned or shamed in public. *Out of character*, obviously. Now, though, do wonder what happened. Soldout was way stronger than him but he did not have access to his next transformation yet because a trigger was also required; so, what happened is that Soldout, regardless also being the Kami of Earth... so its Guardian, he actually went all his way to an unaffiliated planet to stop Gorilla's plans. Surprise surprise again? Soldout defeated Gorilla at first, but the latter then used this chance to transform into a Super Saiyan 2\u2014 He defeated Soldout. Shocking truth, though?! Soldout triggered his next transformation as well!! Oh my god, so unpredictable and exciting!! And so? The two continued fighting but with the eventual prevail of Gorilla until the planet died.\n\nIn the meanwhile, on Vegeta, though... the homosexual Bio-Android I mentioned in the last post... who I will call NotJustATail was about to destroy the planet in vengeance of the Saiyans' invasion on Earth. So, out of everybody else, guess who joins? Kay's IC mom... who was just perfectly fine for a transformation trigger, ah, how convenient. Thing was, though, that NotJustATail was basically three times stronger than her. Which meant, that even if she could transform, she wouldn't really be able to even get to it because the slightest seriousness from NotJustATail would have killed her. But somehow, for some unknown reasons, despite the Bio-Android's hatred towards Saiyans, she went easy on her... and so the Saiyan mom turned into a Super Saiyan. Remember what I said about staff being lenient *only* towards their friends? No? Well, now you know it. But, the mama is still basically no match, so what happens Kay finally joins the thread and fights her former lover\u2014 yes, I know\u2014 NotJustATail in a deadly battle. Given she's still much stronger than Kay, though, her last trump card is to sacrifice herself to save Vegeta and kill both herself and the Bio-Android. Now. Guess what. NotJustATail rightfully earned Hell... and special Hell training, because in the Afterlife there was a thing called Check-in Station\u2014 you guys know what it is if you've watched Dragon Ball Z\u2014 where you'd be judged and sent either to Heaven or Hell based on your actions. But, there was also a special case where if you had done certain heroic or malicious deeds that had any importance in the site's story, you could earn Afterlife Training such as the one from King Kai. On here, there was also the good guys' counterpart training that was reflected in training with Beelzebub down in Hell for only the very very bad guys.\n\nThe fact that the Bio-Android earned that is not even a surprise because: she had actually been evil and done terrible things, plus she was big friends with Kay and staff, so it's not all that surprising. But then? Kay was judged to fit for King Kai training\u2014 and there, *excuse me what the fuck?* A Saiyan who has been an asshole and has participated in the invasion of Earth, therefore she has assisted to the destruction of multiple cities and obviously deaths of people... is actually fit for the kind of training Son Goku did?\n\nThat was just stupid.\n\nBut hey, Kay was a moderator so *all* was possible for her.\n\nNow, though, let's return in the world of the living and remember what Gorilla was doing... well, guess what, not only he won but he immediately started criticizing the Galactic Patrol for having not \"*participated*\" and tried to stop the evil tyrant. Okay, lore-wise, he would have been right; because out of everyone, they would have been the first to answer such a call. One of ours, LightsaberMaster went I believe, but he did little but basically waste time and just get Death-Enabled thread bonus rewards. Which is the reason we didn't go; he accused us of just spending our time in dojos and grinding Power Level\u2014 the same guy who shoved fruits down his throat to get *free* Power Level. But again, I will remark what we exactly thought and stated: We did not want to honestly battle a foe that was almost twice as strong as our leader, who was the strongest in the faction, so, imagine what would have become of the rest of us\u2014 Gorilla, at the time, was over thrice my *own* character's power. And he wasn't even a Super Saiyan yet, so go figure.\n\nSo, he just started shit-talking the Galactic Patrol for being misled and that we didn't apparently know how to roleplay at all; accused us of metagaming and simple and plain power gaming because we were trying strong fast. The latter was true, to a sense, we were trying to grow quickly\u2014 exactly so that we could join in story events and have a certain impact. Because we are talking about Dragon Ball Z. Sure, Gorilla stated: *NOT ALL IS ABOUT POWER LEVEL. YOU GUYS COULD HAVE TRIED TO TALK HER INTO STOPPING.*\n\nAnd we all saw what happened: The Queen destroyed Soldout and turned him into a brainwashed *Darth Vader rip-off* for her Solar Saiyan Empire.\n\nPlus, the thing about this website is that in most cases every Saga thread lasted at least two months. And when you joined a Saga, and therefore a Death-Enabled thread, you *couldn't* join other threads. So you'd find yourself stuck in this slow thread for ages until it would end. Either that or maybe your character would die and so you were basically finally free. Even though, you'd be restricted to the Afterlife boards which weren't all that active given the low percentage of characters that stayed there.. so, yeah.\n\nWe were done with this shit. So we decided to leave and instead try and make our own websites. At first, LightsaberMaster apparently leaked that in the chatbox and he was approached from the staff about this; they were basically afraid that we would be like Soy and plagiarize them and etc. Thing is, we *weren't* even making a Dragon Ball Z website, to begin with\u2014 and we had our own systems in mind. Rapper also once tried and suggest to Gorilla that he had to do something about all this nepotism and shit, otherwise the site would have died. So, what happened is basically that LightsaberMaster, even though he basically had no proof of anything, he still decided to approach Kay and leaked logs of Rapper talking shit about the website in general, from way back. So, what happened one afternoon is that Rapper suddenly found himself permabanned.\n\nThe warning to this day still states: \"He tried to coerce members into leaving this website and joining FeelyWheely's site. If they didn't, he would bully/harass them.\" \u2014 But you know what's funny? We all left *willingly* and of our own accord. But, LightsaberMaster manipulated shit to make himself look like a victim and stated that we had kicked him out of our own chat after he began talking shit about how FeelyWheely's idea was *dumb* and that he would stay on the DBZ site even if he were to be the only and last member standing. So, since we were leaving, we kicked him because of that; it was useless for him to stay on that chat, to begin with, it wasn't like any of us were really friends with him. But the Jedi that we all deserve wasn't happy with that and at least managed to get Rapper permabanned and got some dirt on the rest of us.\n\nBut we didn't really care.\n\nWe just left and did our own thing. I sort of stayed, mostly because I was about to get my chance to become a Super Saiyan, so there was that. But for the most part we became active elsewhere and in most cases worked on our own websites.\n\nWhat happened on the DBZ site in the meanwhile? Kay harassed an artist who was also a member; saying that he was an *insensitive* and *rude fuck* because the art he had made for her was not as good looking as the one he had made for somebody else. She raged fiercely, so, the staff team was forced to demote her this time\u2014 because otherwise, they would have basically looked like the circlejerk they truly were. While this was going on, our boy LightsaberMaster was *very smart* and *sly* to go on and actually respond to the warning board, making fun of Kay for having been finally demoted and that it was a long time coming. He went on to call her a prick and alike, saying that she never deserved to be in charge. Do not forget, my friends, that Kay was still friends with the whole staff team... so, yeah, LightsaberMaster was permanently banned after this.\n\nSo, in a certain sense, karma got him for his *bullshit* on my boy Rapper.\n\nAnd so, I will say that we may be better off ending this post here. It's already as long as it can get, I believe, but there's still way too much left to talk about but I will leave you with one final note: We eventually created our own DBZ site with original and exciting mechanics that tempted even the 'Rustle DBZ site's staff members' to give it a try. Needless to say, we didn't even need to advertise on their board that we found ourselves full of their people that had decided to run off on our site because they had also been victims of either Gorilla or another staff member.\n\nAnd so, we had created the '*Rustle Killer*'\u2014 it's not what we actually nicknamed it, but you know, I can *not* leak that website's name.\n\nThough, even then, we were nowhere done with that site and their people. I had initially predicted this post and one more to end this '*saga*', but I fear I will have to write some short posts about certain stories on that community that deserve their own space.\n\nAnd so we're done for this post. But I am sure I'll hear from you all soon with the next story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
