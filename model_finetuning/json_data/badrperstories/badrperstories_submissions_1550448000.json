            "selftext": "I'm male.  I usually use a male-sounding username. I play male, female, or genderless characters. I really don't have a preference.\n\nIt's nothing new that roleplay is clogged with [M4F] postings, but now I'm noticing a trend of female roleplayers who will only play with other females. Considering how many thirsty guys are around, I don't even blame them, but it still makes it increasingly harder for me to find a partner.\n\nIn the past couple weeks I've not had any replies when I message male users about their ads.  Finally I decided to make an alt account with a very female sounding username to see what the result was.  Lo and behold, I got replies.  \n\nOn my male account I try to make myself an attractive partner, providing writing samples, plot ideas, and character designs.  On my female alt I was purposely vague and asked the other person for ideas just to give them the head's up that I would be the kind of person who never puts any effort into plotting.\n\nBut of course, the female account got replies.  And just for the record, I wasn't messaging people looking exclusively for ERP.  I don't do ERP.\n\nI know that these kinds of people, who are clearly only looking to get off on the fact that they are talking to a person with a vagina, would have made horrible partners anyway, and that I'm not losing anything by being rejected by them. But they so saturate the roleplay world that it's like wading through an ocean of shit. Along with them are the people who can't write, won't contribute ideas, or only pop online once a week to write a few low-effort lines.  It just isn't worth it anymore.",

            "selftext": "I've grown to be wary when people say that they want to make 'inspirations' of popular character's for RP's. Sometimes it's never just taking a bit of inspiration but full on making that character from another fandom as their own, sometimes not even changing their name. But, hey I take liberties when I like the idea of writing certain traits, or the like so I try to see what they've got before I make too many judgements.\n\n\nSo last week I wanted a fairly bleak but hopefully down to earth-ish zombie apocalypse (I may have a type) I send out the call, detailing what I'm kinda looking for as I try to find interested parties. Enter Dude because I said that aloud one to many times while dealing with them.\n\n\nSo Dude tells me they want a character inspired by the Punisher or Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil. Okay, well let's see the sheets and go from there. Enter, Trench-Coat Fist Punch. Maybe Dead-Wife Trench Coat could've worked too. He was a vigilante and okay, that can be cool even if it's a little out there. Meant to be the capable fighter of the group. Then I get the sheet.\n\n\nHe was the stock Edgy character you see who was so cool and So Prepared. His equipment section was larger than his personality which basically broke down into a few traits. Angry, Masculine, Weakness is Women in Danger, Actually Good Person, Vengeful and Probably Killed More Than A Few People?\n\n\nYeah, no. So I try to gently ask for him to tone it down a bit. A little less Movies Resident Evil and maybe a bit more walking dead? 28 days later? Nope. Immediately I get a 'Oh guess we won't work out because you want my character so much weaKER. ???, I didn't say that exactly. Just less prepared? Not carrying all these weapons, grenades and somehow resistant to pain and heals quickly? I told you wanted I was going for when we first discussed this RP?\n\n\nThis is where our communication broke down further. Dude had the notion that they knew exactly what I wanted. In fact they understood more than I did about what I was going for. Little to no violence (It's zombies???) no action (Again, zombies during the start) and character's talking all the time (I mean yes that's how an RP can progress) Character's have to be weak all the time (???) I literally asked he be less of a one man army and that apparently translated to like a bABY (It's the start dude) Then he turned it around at me that we were not compatible partner's which I did agree upon but the passive aggressiveness of their words made me feel defensive. It was my fault because I didn't fully check what he liked first! I should've checked to see if they liked what I was selling (I told you in the initial PM) He's not great at horror or zombies (Why did you reply to my attempted recruitment then?) That my ideas for an RP will just force other's to morph their styles in an attempt to fit in (Dude.) That those like him will hate my forum and leave (Bro c'mon now)\n\n\nWhat really baffled me about the end was the last thing they said to me. \"you go the way of the enemies are always stronger and i'll go the way of the enemies are of equal strength.\"\n\n\nDude, I just asked you to tone it down a bit. He also said some other weird stuff that I should've seen as weird flags like potentially being a descendant of a god because angry, and immensely disliking monotheism and just blurting that out of the blue. That character was like Edgy Resident Evil 5 Chris Redfield within season one of the the Walking Dead. Rambo in Dawn of the Dead. Chill out.",

He can't possibly get any worse than that, right?\"\n\n**Wrong.**\n\nMr. MLAMNoTD shoved himself into the center of every plot thread - even ones that weren't supposed to involve him at all. He also insisted that his timekeeping headcanon - every twenty posts in the thread equal one year of in-game time - is agreed to by everyone. Even though he literally told that to no-one until the timing issues caused by that showed up, and in some cases actually contradicted the characters' backstories and (estimated and actual) lifespans.\n\nAnd in the RP, my character was adopted by a character who themself were adopted by Mr. MLAMNoTD's character. So Mr. MLAMNoTD insisted both were both related to him biologically, and not just by adoption, and were carbon-copies of his character ability-wise. Both of us... didn't envision or play our respective characters that way.\n\nAround May last year, all that pushed me to a breaking point, and I finally decided to call him out on that. This... didn't end well - the resulting argument caused the RP to be shut down for good.\n\nLuckily, in June last year, the old fellowship regrouped - without Mr. MLAMNoTD this time - and made a spiritual successor RP which still continues today with none of those incidents.",

After he scares them off, my char wakes up and they talk. The space marine then goes to track the robbers down.\n\nKarnie, in his infinite wisdom, \"detects\" the robbery and decides to pay my guy a visit. Remember, my character had a really rough day. His dad died, he got knocked out, and his shop got robbed. He's also paranoid and concussed, like anybody would be from these events.\n\nIt doesn't take much imagination to predict what he would do when a fully armed man breaks through his door. \n\nKarnie: \"Tundra snarls, unsure of why this child was pointing a gun at his human. I wave Tundra back put the gun down kid. don't make me take you down again\"\n\nYeah, I forgot to mention that he made a pet wolf. I also forgot to mention that he doesn't use quotation marks. Mega oof.\n\nMy character, being a gunsmith/weapons expert, planted a claymore in the door way to protect himself from more robbers. Karnie immediately assaults me and knocks the gun out of my hand, I then set the claymore off in the direction of his wolf. \n\nHe, of course, manages to god mod the shit of it.\n\nKarnie: \"I rush towards my Wolf, placing myself between him and the projectiles. most of them fly past us harmlessly, and those that's don't bounce off my armor alright, that's it. Tundra, come. I'm not going to bother protecting this kid until he learns what \"respect\" means I leave, my Wolf following me, whimpering. a stray ball scuffed his flank\"\n\nNow he's faster than sonic and he's impervious to claymores. Ultra-oof. He then decides to leave my character a little gift.\n\nKarnie: \"casually tosses a flashbang into the shop \nBOOM\"\n\nI decide to set off a domino effect where the flashbang set off the gun powder stores in the shop. You know, to show him that being really stupid and morally righteous has consqeuences. Also, I wanted to give my char a reason to kill Karnie later on.\n\nKarnie was... not real pleased with that.\n\nKarnie: \"(what the fuck is it with you and self-harm? it was a fucking flashbang, you're the one who blew up your own shop)\"\n\nHe doesn't really know what a setup is.\n\nNext part: Actual unconsensual Nice Guy Antics",

I said that this character is hard to RP because they don't work well with every character and require extensive planning so the plot can be successful. This was not a comment about my partner, just my general observation of my own character. I even threw in some suggestions afterward and asked if they would be up for a plot we discussed earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner just goes: \" Oh, I see.\" and disappears.

            "selftext": "Well... I\u2019ve been looking for a place in order to post this. Thank goodness I found this subreddit. Here we go.\n\nMy first experience with Magzus was on the Bionicle Amino back in 2017. We, actually became friends at that point. \n\nBut after a simple RP Fight, he sorta got a bit stroppy. He pulled a few sore loser moves to try and keep the fight going after he was meant to lose.\n\nWhen I was fighting him:\n\n1: I beat his head into a paste. But he simply used Quick Healing in order to literally regenerate his head.\n\n2: I cut his head vertically in half while also using a power nullifying weapon to keep him from Quick Healing. He somehow managed to stay alive and pulled a Dio Brando.\n\nThe third and final time was when I cut him vertically in half. This was when he tried to argue, saying his Quick Healing would allow him to survive. All I asked was:\n\n\u201cHow can you survive being vertically CUT IN HALF\u201d\n\nHe through a strop and whines about losing. And this was ALL IN THE SAME FIGHT.\n\nOutside of the Roleplaying, and after a fair bit of time, he had his second outburst. He went off on one of the other members called Ventron, Ven for short, and a good friend of mine.\n\nHe demanded Ven to get rid of his Shadow Power buff because Magzus believed that no one can have shadow powers surpassing the Makuta. I had to step in and basically shut down Magzus, by telling him to shut the fuck up and let Ven do as he pleases. He later went off at Ven once more because of his Armour. Demanding he get rid of that as well, even going to the extent of getting the Leaders and Curators of the Amino involved, forcing Ven to scrap his armour.\n\nAfter this and after the I became a curator, Magzus once again threw a hissy fit because he didn\u2019t get picked for being a curator and I did, saying I was going to be a power hungry tyrant.\n\nThankfully I managed to pull some strings with the other leaders and such to allow Ven to get the armour back, albeit nerfed.\n\nThe second in RP encounter, was when he was using his MoC called Keevaris, against my Pseudo Elemental called Exilus, because they both were Stone users. He lost miserably, and started a whole slew of controversy,\n\n(To summarise Pseudo Elementals, they\u2019re like Logia Type Devil Fruit users from One Piece, only they aren\u2019t weak to seawater, and arrived on the planet through an asteroid collision)\n\nHe went off at me saying that I was Broken because of how I tanked his Nova Blast. To which, I\u2019ll Admit, Exilus is literally my heaviest hitter. In my defence, Magzus broke the one rule about fighting Exilus:\n\n**You don\u2019t get close to him**\n\nHe was later caught talking crap behind my back, and accused me of calling him Autistic in the context that I used it as an insult. In my defence, I made the assumption that Magzus might be on the spectrum, but I never directly called him autistic, let alone as an insult. If I did that, I\u2019d be shooting my self in the foot as I myself am autistic.\n\nThe third outburst came from when he tried to have a go at me through the leaders and Curators, trying to have a fictional stone that I made up *BANNED* because he believed that there was no way around it, or because he believed that only I had characters capable of breaking it.\n\nFor a simple explanation, this Stone I made up is called Black Prismite. A super strong stone that can either weaken or flat out nullify elemental or Makuta based powers. Depending on the kind of Black Prismite. He wanted it banned because he believed he had no way of beating me. Though he actually beat me more times than not, even when I used it.\n\nHis fourth outburst came when it came to our final fight. By final I mean the fight where me and Magzus ever fought each other.\n\nThis resulted in a loss on his part, after he died to multiple bullet wounds and expending all his energy in a Nova Blast, to which my character survived, with the aid of his shield and Black Prismite.\n\nFollowing the fight, he somehow revived and then tried to organise a plot to assassinate my character. Yet claims I\u2019m going out for him when I try to kill him again, and kills himself. In RP of course, not IRL.\n\nAfter this incident, Magzus was on a Final Warning, after he caused a great deal of trouble for the RP scene, gatekeeping, Broken Shenanigans, and mass False Flagging because of a post I went over about Overpowered Characters and how I mentioned that he was able to spam both his Quick Healing and Adaptation Powers to make himself immune to everything he comes up against.\n\nHis final outburst came when he was bored and wanted to fight someone. He then openly challenged another friend of mine, Blu. Because he wanted to beat them.  Blu turned him down, because he knew he would lose against Magzus. Magzus got angry, and then blew up on him. Somehow the topic of him being called a Shitty Curator flew about. That was when it was decided that Magzus needed to be banned.\n\nIt was swiftly done, but it wasn\u2019t over as he flipped the fuck out on one of the leaders on Discord and aolidifying his ban.\n\nPrevious to the ban, he often went black and left the Amino god knows how many times, saying he was leaving permanently for petty things, like not getting his Badass moment, or when a MoC of mine was featured, or he wasn\u2019t featured when he openly said he hardly put effort into his post.\n\nHis leaving became a bit of a meme and I ran out of JoJo references I could make.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me. The Bionicle Amino Roleplaying scene seems to have died down. But at least we don\u2019t have a person on the same level as Magzus.",

He has armor that can survive claymores, 40mm AT cannons, etc. HE HAS THE POWER TO BEND LIGHT TO HIS WILL AND MAKE INPENETRABLE SHIELDS.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe begin with an rp session on the wall, my character joining Karnie and a Space Marine. We banter a bit until I make fun of Karnie's \"inpenetrable\" scanner. He suddenly says \"I AM A STAFF SEARGENT MARINE, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.\" Remember, he is also saying this to a 1,500 year old space marine in a dreadnought. We start to see his ego emerge in full force afterwards.\n\nMy char is a gunsmith and he is armed with a .308 bolt action. Karnie is armed with a FN SCAR-L chambered in 7.62 (I tried to correct him, he refused). He senses a giant beast heading our direction and I shoot the thing five times. He decides to use HEAT shells (anti-tank rounds in a 7.62?) to blast the thing apart.\n\nAfterwards, he comments how my gun barely managed to tickle the beast. We both used the same caliber, but he somehow had access to HEAT rounds of all things.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"pcblah, you're being a bit anal about this.\" I probably am, but this just the beginning.\n \nAnother battle commences and I kill off my gunsmith character to develop another, his son. Karnie then decides that he should REVIVE MY CHARACTER WITH A TIME BENDING TUBE.\n\nI told him explicitly to stop reviving my character, but he then said \"I refuse\". After my char kills himself after seeing the horrors of the afterlife (and burning alive, there were nothing but ashes left), he decides to DO IT AGAIN.\n\nAfter I make my char go crazy and run into the wilderness, he catches up to him and shoots him in the face. AND THEN HE DECIDES TO REVIVE HIM ONCE AGAIN.\n\nAfter a few people started to complain, he decided to shoot my guy in the face and bury him in the woods. Big oof.\n\nI then introduce my new character, the gun smith's son. We do the whole meet n' greet and tell the kid his dad is dead bit. I then tell Karnie that his M249 is a piece of junk.\n\nHe decides to punch my character in the face, whereupon I raise my gun and he knocks it out of my hand. I take my pistol and shoot him in the chest, he decides to knock me out.\n\nBefore this, he never stated that he had armor of any kind. Apparently he amended that right after this on his char sheet.\n\nNext part: Non-consenual stuff and moral high ground. Coming soon.",

            "selftext": "This keeps getting deleted from the r/Roleplay so I figured I'd try to post it here. \n\nI'm part of this larger RP group and some of our members are divided over one player and her character. We are M-rated group and some of the stuff explored in the threads is rather dark, there has always been boundaries though, ones that we all feel this one person is breaking.\n\nUsually, when someone creates a darker character they have this lighthearted aspect in them. And I think this is how you should write darker characters if you're doing roleplay.\n\nSo this girl has a character that's basically tortured and abused until his mind breaks. The character is paranoid and delusional. And violent. Fine, he's rather funny at the times because of the random weirdness he talks about. Nothing wrong with this guy until the player started pushing backstory for this guy.\n\nSummarized: the character is abused and neglected as a child. He's a psychopath and has been that way ever since he was a child. When he grew up, he eventually ends up murdering people because he enjoys it (women, mostly....). Then he gets captured and the torture storyline takes place. His present self doesn't remember anything and isn't really a functional person after all that.\n\nI won't go into details because I'm 100% someone will recognize this char and start calling me an offended snowflake. The issue is not that the char is not properly explored, he's actually written so well it's scary. It's like the player is purposely trying to make us sympathize with this character even though it's disgusting to ever feel sympathy for someone like this.\n\nShe even roped some players to get their characters attached to this char before fully explaining what she's going to do with him.",

            "selftext": "Me again! This is a wonderful place to vent at. If this subreddit does allow images, I'll have my fair share to post with these ridiculous stories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my last post talked about a horrible role player who was just too OP. I have a similar story, though not as crazy. Let's call this certain role player; Star.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar joined our role play (the same one Mouse was on) in early June of 2017. She was okay at first, having some sort of edgy name. She submitted her characters and role played. Now, her grammar wasn't the best. It was really hard to understand her. But all of that could be excused when you learned that English wasn't her native language. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was one of the moderators but I couldn't put in characters since I needed to be the organizer to edit the chat description. Star had entered some of her characters and I told her that they are added. Our rules clearly stated to not be rude to the mods and don't add any groups of cats such as Clans and rogue groups. Apparently, Star didn't read it and sent in a whole Clan. We declined and she blew up in our faces. We politely told her to not scream at us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar continued to be rude to us. We told her, again and again, to be nice. One day, she wrote Plz tell \\*insert leader name\\* to kick me out of this chat room im too lazy for that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe organizer wasn't very active because of all of her school work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, Star starts to send advertisements to her chats. The rules in our chat firmly state that advertising is not allowed. Though she kept sending them. At one point she started spamming the chat and I had to get the organizer online to get rid of her for a few days.\n\nStar: If someone wanna join my new chatroom follow me so I can invite you\n\nLynx: WUT\n\nStar: Im creating new chat room whats problem with that?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told them that I didn't want to be invited since this one chat was enough for me. They acted really sad and tried to guilt trip me into joining. I didn't. She said that we were friends and I still declined. Over the next few days, she brought it up as much as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar even told me to not play as Storm. I was confused, asking why. They never gave reasoning. I was so confused but continued to play him since he was my main character at the moment. Star didn't bring it up again which still really confused me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got mad when our characters were at camp and her's were outside so they couldn't interact. She got mad at the smallest inconveniences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Star began to get angry at the organizer of the chat because she wasn't on much. \" No srsly \\*insert organizer name here\\* why you don't rp in your own chatroom?\" I mentioned to Star that sometimes my character gets visits from the villain (Who's played by the organizer), and Star made the irrelevant comment of, \"That's rare XD.\" That made me a little upset. A few days later, she sent another complaint about the organizer's inactivity. The organizer finally came on and chewed her out and gave the unnecessary speech of people having lives outside of the chat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar even claims to be the strongest warrior in the whole Clan. She claims also to be very skilled with herbs, which is the medicine cat's job to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar had gotten into a few fights. Thankfully she did learn her lesson about advertising chats and told another user not to do it when all of the mods weren't on. This other person, we'll call Firefly, was trying to advertise a chat despite the rules. Star told them off and Firefly ended the friendship and left the chat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirefly joined the chat not long after to fight with Star. Firefly called Star names and they both would not back down when others told them to leave it be. One person (I might make a post about her), Freedom, tried bribing them to stop with free art. The two declined, saying that they can get requests anywhere. I finally came online to confront them. They just gave the \"ugh\" emojis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar seems to be a little homophobic. Someone's character had a crush on another with the same sex. We were pretty open about gay relationships, so it was pretty out of the blue that she called the person out for it. But people have their beliefs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore drama came out with Star and another user that we'll call Sunny (I have some bad role play experience with her too). We first found out about the drama when someone in the chat complimented Sunny's character and offered to draw them. Star got really upset because she hated Sunny. She said to block her and never accept any apology she has. Star is telling the entire chat of 50+ people. She called Sunny \"Nothing,\" \"she is just little invsivibl breeze for us, ignore her COMPLETELY,\" and \"One word, Sunny is trash.\" She even sent us to report her and attack her. Most of the people in the chat had common sense and refused to do what Star said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI informed the organizer of the chat about this whole witch hunting business. She finally had enough and kicked Star out of the chat with a list of reasons as to why. Star did not understand why. She said that she had friends in the chat, but the organizer said that they could talk outside of the chat. Star finally understood and left us alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUNTIL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar came back on a different account with a full apology and let. That was the last we heard of her except for a few pms of her checking up on us.",

            "selftext": "Using a throwaway, hence why this is the first post (except a weird one I made because I didn't want my main account tainted by a really weird question)\n\nMy gf and I role-played all the time, and usually we would just be roleplaying us talking, but occasionally there would be character arcs. Neko the God of love goes crazy or a dream demon (Heavily inspired by Bill Cipher) tries to destroy us because of a prophecy and it was great. She was a total Mary Sue and I actually have a lot of stories, so I'll be telling as many as I remember,\n\n1) How my girlfriend cheated on me.\n\nSo I come home and just want to talk, she's rping a bit, nothing strange. She starts to introduce her new friends, played by her. It's Sora and whatever the girl main character from No Game No Life is. I recommended it to her, alls good.\n\nThen she starts flirting with Sora, then eventually they climb out the window together. I ask if we can stop roleplaying which *somehow* annoys Sora, so now I'm arguing with two people and it was crazy.\n\n2) Mary Sue and the Tale of a Thousand Deaths\n\nSo Miss Sue, my gf, occasionally will die. Every time she'd come back different. Now look, if you were the Queen of the Fire Furries (She was seriously the Queen of the Firefoxes and had a Fire Fox mode she could transform into) then you'd have magic death countermeasures. Every time you die to come back in an amulet, or you have a magic save point, or your ashes have the ability to be revived with a drop of your blood.\n\nBut you wouldn't have multiple. Every time she died there was a new resurrection method, one time we both died and so my Clone, who was a bad guy recently turned good, had to go to Summoner's Hill (A really cool location I thought of she used for our revival) and he would use that to resummon us. Story 3 is also here. So if we have summoners hill, why also have:\n\na) the ability to explode and come back as a fire fox without consequences\n\nb) your ashes can be revived by being given a drop of your blood\n\nc) breaking the weapon that killed you restores you\n\nd) Come back but \\[insert random effect that really didn't have much effect on the role-play or was ret-conned 3 weeks later\\]\n\ne) A LITERAL RESET OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE BUT SHE RETAINS HER KNOWLEDGETO OVERCOME HER DEATH AND NOW I'M TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE EFFECTS BY CHANGING UP MY CHARACTER BUT THATS NOT ALLOWED\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) You Can't have a character arc, I'm going to cheat on you again!\n\nIf whatever arc we were on wasn't about her it doesn't matter. A bit of focus on me so that I can flesh out my brother than was a skeleton and reveal why I'm not a skeleton, all leading to my brother betraying me to get the secret magic that keeps me alive resulting in cool tension?\n\nNah lets go back to that one time this NPC I made thats the King of the Foxes is crushing on me again OwO UwU 7u7 ;-;\n\nI mentioned Summoner's Hill, I had this whole plan for a bad guy coming back, developing the clone character from before further, etc, and I would do this simply;\n\nwe were killed by a mecha with a scientist in it and by the God of Hate, Edon. We use Summoner's Hill to come back for the first time ever. But there's not enough magic to bring us both through, so I become a ghost.\n\nCons:\n\nnone, I can become physical at anytime and keep all my magic\n\nPros:\n\nI get to further flesh out how my character would deal with this and give me cooler magic stuff, like she's been getting which will also nerf some of my overpowered abilities like literally turning people to dust by removing their molecules or instant worldwide teleportation.\n\nShe doesn't like this, and goes off and cheats with King of the Foxes that I mentioned earlier. So now I play as a ghost wandering around while she flirts with an NPC. I take control of the NPC and make him turn out to be a drug addict and a male prostitute, petty revenge but whatever. These issues were always flipped to make me seem like the bad guy and she'd have to leave to deal with her stress, and when she's cut herself its my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) Could you play 8 characters?\n\nAh, Truth or Dare. A fun game, but pull in more NPCs? Even more fun! Not if your the guy trusted with playing 7 NPCs and yourself. Lets see if I can remember:\n\nKokona from yandere simulator\n\nThe goth girl from yandere simulator\n\na male from yandere simulator\n\nSans from undertale\n\nPapyrus from undertale\n\nMy clone\n\nmy sisters clone\n\nTwo of her OCs\\*\n\nThat's 9, but not all were present at every Truth or Dare game. *and there were a lot.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*explination of this character is that my gf is actually the holy trinity, there's one character thats a god, one thats a human, and one thats a fox, her. The god one is a selfish prick that ends up dying and somehow because it killed me, and she killed it, its my fault?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end it turned out she was cheating on me. We've broken up.\n\nI'm really hoping she doesn't see this, I left on equal terms with her after a bit over a year of fighting for closure but thought this would be the story I'd love to hear, so I'd tell it to others.",
