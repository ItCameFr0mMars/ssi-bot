Everything is perfect, until the creep joins the server. \n\nNo one really knows where he came from, he just appeared one day and introduced himself. He seemed to write exclusively with one of our members so we figured they invited him. No biggie.\n\nMy first impressions of the guy aren't that great. The dude barely talks and promptly tells everyone they prefer \"lurking\", their avatar picture is them holding a bread knife to their cheek. Fine, I understand that I have a tendency to get overly suspicious of people. I try to be nice to the Mr Butter Knife, he answers my casual greeting with a weird, edgy comment. I'm weirded out but decide to let it go. \n\nCouple of days pass and the dude barely communicates with anyone. It's obvious that he is indeed always watching, as he's fast to jump in with a edgy comment as soon as the opportunity arises. Someone says something about going on a date, the dude comments that his tinder dates are intimidated by his katana collection. Okay there, guy. \n\nThen he starts doing a really creepy rp with that one person he's always writing with. It's really uncomfortable to read. Turns out the other person had never agreed to write that stuff with the creep and he just kept forcing the rp into that direction. \n\nThey drop the rp (Thank God) and then mr edgelord starts spamming suggestive, disgusting gifs to our server. The admins tell him to stop. He gets pissy and calls us judgmental.\n\nOne night the dude is going through a full-blown hissy-fit over something. The person they had been rping with had apparently turned down his advances. I tell him it's time to chill and he threatens to stab me with the butter knife in his avatar. It's so absurd that I simply laugh at him and he gets mad, proceeding to post a dick pic in one of our channels.\n\nNeedless to say, he's not part of our group anymore. ",

            "selftext": "I've been part of a group for a very long time.  The group itself has been going for about 15 years.  My 10th anniversary with the group would be coming around this summer.  When I started out, I was isolated, unemployed, and depressed.  It was a great way to socialise and feel less alone in the world.\n\nBut the game I've been playing in is not the same game it was when I joined all those years ago.  Most of my favourite players have moved on.  The ones who stuck around are largely there out of tradition and habit, it feels like.  This is very easily illustrated in the post volume.  When I started, it was common to have 20+ new posts per day.  On the weekends, twice that easily.  Now, we get maybe 2-3 posts a week.  People grew up.  They moved on.  That's cool.  I've been hanging around because I had stuff I wanted to do with other players, and with my own plots, but that's been getting much less fun over the past couple of years.  I've been wishywashy on dropping for a while.  Today, I finally made the decision to bounce.\n\nI started to realise the remaining players suffered from severe head-up-ass syndrome a couple years ago.  My character got into a few (pre-planned) fights shortly after I introduced him.  This used to be fairly normal, but these days people seem to want to avoid having their precious baby bumped or bruised.  That's fine.  The people my character fought with had agreed to the fight, and in some instances, started it.  Little did I know this would give my character a reputation.  Okay, I expected him to get an in-game reputation, but it bled out into the players.  It didn't take very long at all before that character was only being tagged by a few other players, while everyone else avoided him.  Okay.  Fine.  Whatever.\n\nThat was around the time I decided to get him a dog.  It wasn't a dog he chose to get; it just sort of happened within the narrative.  It was a stray dog that started hanging around, and just eventually became his.  Immediately mod called for playing an animal abuse plot.  The mods realised this was not the case, but asked that I and anyone else using the dog label all posts as containing the dog, just to appease whoever was whining.  Well, I'd just started a small plot with another player where the dog was central.  So suddenly the majority of the posts were labelled as containing this poor, abused, imaginary dog.  More modcalls came rolling in, prompting a slight change in rules not to call the mods on in-game behaviour unless you've talked to the other players first.  Mods backtracked on their original ruling that the dog had to be labelled in warning, and let us go about our business.  \n\nAt this point, I'm down to two people who will thread with me.  Any attempts to tag out get ignored.  I backed away from the game at this point, since it was pretty obvious that whoever was doing the mod calls was a major player, and on top of that, was making them based on either me or my character, and not based on anything they were reading.  Especially since the plot in question was \"dog gets adopted, fed up and healthy, and borrowed without permission by someone who wanted to see how a pet would fit into their family.\"  Or, in other words, \"dog gets loved on from multiple angles and loves it.\"\n\nI haven't quit yet, and still enjoy playing with the few people who will actually thread with me at this point.  Some more time went by, and the other player involved brought up the whole dog fiasco, and joked that if reactions were that bad over a dog, how bad would a child be?  Well, already feeling pretty disillusioned with everything, I contacted the mods.  I am going to give my character a small child.  Would this be cool?  Mods, as expected, have no problem with this.  There aren't even any rules against it, but I wanted to subtly give the mods a heads up that people may disagree with my plot choices again.  So I start leading the plot in that direction, introduce the kid, and all hell breaks loose.  My character is not the nicest human being, so in order to make the kid fit in with what's already been established, I go for the typical route where he didn't know about the kid, and the situation had to be bad enough for this guy to be considered the better option.  So he's got himself a two year old with a language delay and a mom that can't handle it.  This imaginary child is otherwise healthy and on track developmentally.  He just needs a little help, and my character is in a position of wealth and free time to do it.\n\nThis is wrong.  Since players can no longer go to the mods without first talking to me, I now know who's taken against this character and who just hasn't been interested enough to tag.  I know this because both IC and OOC, I've been getting nothing but lectures and complaints about child abuse and neglect.  Of an imaginary child.  In a plot where the whole point has been my character making the best effort possible to help the child that was dumped in his lap.  \n\nI kind of expected this to be honest, though not to the level I got.  I decided, after talking to another player today, that I'm done.  I'd linked her to a thread for her opinion, and she agreed that the other player was way over the line.  The thread was less than 10 tags, and nothing but this person telling my character how evil and wrong he was for not working every possible second of the day at getting the imaginary kid caught up on his imaginary language development.  It was so obvious this player had never read a single thread or post of mine that it was like a slap in the face.  I'm not here for you to scream at me over your own personal issues.  I'm here to play a game.\n\nExcept I'm not, because I quit.  Have fun with your talking heads where nothing interesting happens.",

            "selftext": "Now, to clarify, when I mean 'public RP server,' I mean the ones where you can just hop in at any time. Stuff like Roblox, Minecraft the like, but 'Roblox RP servers are bad,' wouldn't be nearly eye-catching. \n\nI perfectly understand the reasons for these existing. They're a way for roleplayers to hop on at any time without having to wait for weeks to have SOMETHING pop up. But the negatives in this type of role-playing far outweighs the positive. That being said, if you like public RP servers, more power to you. This list isn't meant to harm you in any way. \n\nNow, without further ado, let's get started. \n\n\n1. The roleplayers are bad\n\n Like, *REEAAALLLY* bad. Most public RP servers take place on very... kid-friendly games, like the aforementioned Roblox and Minecraft. Therefore, there will be a lot of kids out there who have no idea how to make a good roleplay and only want to do it for their own enjoyment. For example:\n\nShoving their characters into the spotlight. \nPoor grammar. \nUnderdeveloped characters. \nG O D M O D D I N G  O U T  T H E  A S S\nThose are just the ones that come up to my head. \n\nThat being said, I have seen some genuinely good people in my time in public RP servers. However, their skills are limited by... \n\n2. Severe time constraints\n\n When you're in a public server, chances are you'll want to stick around since once you leave, there's no guarantee that the person you role-played with will be on the next day. And if you friended them, you better pray to God that someone listed down what happened and that you're able to get a private server. So you'll probably want to stay. The problem is that the server is real time. Meaning that whenever someone posts, you'll have a maximum of 30 seconds to write down your half-assed, 3 sentence line saying that you punch someone really hard. And if someone decides to jump in and steal the glory, you better have the mute command drilled into your head. \n\n3. Awkward positioning\n\nMost public RP servers force you to make your OC and plunge it into the environment. This leads to most of the characters just standing around, smiling, with their cheesy ass poses, as they grieve about their long time mentor. And even if they do have different poses, most of them are just as cheesy as the default. Like, who the hell chose DAB as a pose? \n\n4. No chance of editing\n\nWhen you write your post, you better proof read the hell out of it, because once it gets out there, it's set in stone. If you want to change a story element you regretted after posting your reply, too bad so sad. This along with the 30 second limit adds up to 1 line replies that don't add ANYTHING. \n\n\n\nThat's basically all I have to say about this topic. I haven't seen many people talk about this type are role-playing so I thought I may as well toss out all my thoughts here. Feedback is welcome! ",
