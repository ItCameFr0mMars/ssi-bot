            "selftext": "Using a throwaway, hence why this is the first post (except a weird one I made because I didn't want my main account tainted by a really weird question)\n\nMy gf and I role-played all the time, and usually we would just be roleplaying us talking, but occasionally there would be character arcs. Neko the God of love goes crazy or a dream demon (Heavily inspired by Bill Cipher) tries to destroy us because of a prophecy and it was great. She was a total Mary Sue and I actually have a lot of stories, so I'll be telling as many as I remember,\n\n1) How my girlfriend cheated on me.\n\nSo I come home and just want to talk, she's rping a bit, nothing strange. She starts to introduce her new friends, played by her. It's Sora and whatever the girl main character from No Game No Life is. I recommended it to her, alls good.\n\nThen she starts flirting with Sora, then eventually they climb out the window together. I ask if we can stop roleplaying which *somehow* annoys Sora, so now I'm arguing with two people and it was crazy.\n\n2) Mary Sue and the Tale of a Thousand Deaths\n\nSo Miss Sue, my gf, occasionally will die. Every time she'd come back different. Now look, if you were the Queen of the Fire Furries (She was seriously the Queen of the Firefoxes and had a Fire Fox mode she could transform into) then you'd have magic death countermeasures. Every time you die to come back in an amulet, or you have a magic save point, or your ashes have the ability to be revived with a drop of your blood.\n\nBut you wouldn't have multiple. Every time she died there was a new resurrection method, one time we both died and so my Clone, who was a bad guy recently turned good, had to go to Summoner's Hill (A really cool location I thought of she used for our revival) and he would use that to resummon us. Story 3 is also here. So if we have summoners hill, why also have:\n\na) the ability to explode and come back as a fire fox without consequences\n\nb) your ashes can be revived by being given a drop of your blood\n\nc) breaking the weapon that killed you restores you\n\nd) Come back but \\[insert random effect that really didn't have much effect on the role-play or was ret-conned 3 weeks later\\]\n\ne) A LITERAL RESET OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE BUT SHE RETAINS HER KNOWLEDGETO OVERCOME HER DEATH AND NOW I'M TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE EFFECTS BY CHANGING UP MY CHARACTER BUT THATS NOT ALLOWED\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) You Can't have a character arc, I'm going to cheat on you again!\n\nIf whatever arc we were on wasn't about her it doesn't matter. A bit of focus on me so that I can flesh out my brother than was a skeleton and reveal why I'm not a skeleton, all leading to my brother betraying me to get the secret magic that keeps me alive resulting in cool tension?\n\nNah lets go back to that one time this NPC I made thats the King of the Foxes is crushing on me again OwO UwU 7u7 ;-;\n\nI mentioned Summoner's Hill, I had this whole plan for a bad guy coming back, developing the clone character from before further, etc, and I would do this simply;\n\nwe were killed by a mecha with a scientist in it and by the God of Hate, Edon. We use Summoner's Hill to come back for the first time ever. But there's not enough magic to bring us both through, so I become a ghost.\n\nCons:\n\nnone, I can become physical at anytime and keep all my magic\n\nPros:\n\nI get to further flesh out how my character would deal with this and give me cooler magic stuff, like she's been getting which will also nerf some of my overpowered abilities like literally turning people to dust by removing their molecules or instant worldwide teleportation.\n\nShe doesn't like this, and goes off and cheats with King of the Foxes that I mentioned earlier. So now I play as a ghost wandering around while she flirts with an NPC. I take control of the NPC and make him turn out to be a drug addict and a male prostitute, petty revenge but whatever. These issues were always flipped to make me seem like the bad guy and she'd have to leave to deal with her stress, and when she's cut herself its my fault.\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) Could you play 8 characters?\n\nAh, Truth or Dare. A fun game, but pull in more NPCs? Even more fun! Not if your the guy trusted with playing 7 NPCs and yourself. Lets see if I can remember:\n\nKokona from yandere simulator\n\nThe goth girl from yandere simulator\n\na male from yandere simulator\n\nSans from undertale\n\nPapyrus from undertale\n\nMy clone\n\nmy sisters clone\n\nTwo of her OCs\\*\n\nThat's 9, but not all were present at every Truth or Dare game. *and there were a lot.*\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*explination of this character is that my gf is actually the holy trinity, there's one character thats a god, one thats a human, and one thats a fox, her. The god one is a selfish prick that ends up dying and somehow because it killed me, and she killed it, its my fault?\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end it turned out she was cheating on me. We've broken up.\n\nI'm really hoping she doesn't see this, I left on equal terms with her after a bit over a year of fighting for closure but thought this would be the story I'd love to hear, so I'd tell it to others.",
