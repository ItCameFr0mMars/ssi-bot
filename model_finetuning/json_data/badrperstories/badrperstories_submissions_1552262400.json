            "selftext": "So. I\u2019ve been Rping for a while now, and while I started on tumblr, my preferred medium will always be shamchat(RIP). \n\nOn Saturday night I was skipping through SRPers and the like, looking for a fandom rp (I was playing Connor Murphy from Dear Evan Hansen, if anyone\u2019s wondering). It was about 2am at this point so I was about to log off when I linked with someone playing another character from the show, let\u2019s call them Jared because that was who they were playing. \n\nThey had a starter already, so I decided to reply. Now, their username on Shamchat stated \u201cLONG STARTER IF THAT BOTHERS YOU SKIP. LITERATE ONLY.\u201d I don\u2019t mind long starters and while I lean towards semi-lit and occasionally do only give dialogue replies (because. Like. That\u2019s how books are written) but I only do so when it fits in with the narrative. \n\nThis person sent their starter and good GOD they were not kidding when they said it was long. Instead of starting where the characters met, this person thought it necessary to describe where their character worked, the customers they interacted with, their walk from work to home, them feeding their dog, making dinner and then eating and watching Rick and Morty before going to bed. Then they described him waking up, having a shower and taking his dog for a walk.\n\nThis would have intimidated me had they not written it so badly. All tell. No show. \u201cJared did then. And then he did that.\u201d\n\nStill. I replied with a paragraph describing my character walking down the street, how they looked like a homeless kid, and then their anger at Jared\u2019s dog jumping up at them and knocking them over. Admittedly, it wasn\u2019t that long, but it said what NEEDED to be said. After all, I could expand on the character through dialogue. Maybe throw a few curb balls or plot twists? Who knows. \n\nObviously. This was the wrong thing to do.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d They wrote OOC. \u201cI said LITERATE!\u201d \n\nNow correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019d say a paragraph with multiple sentences classified as pretty lit (heh). \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdd more or I\u2019m moving on!\u201d\n\nNow. I have this thing where I constantly feel as though it\u2019s my fault that people are angry, regardless of how irrational they\u2019re being, so I add a few more sentences describing how Connor was living on his own and how his gloves were falling apart. \n\n\u201cStill not long enough. But I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d written about 150 words at this point to just describe this dude walking down a street, almost half a page. I\u2019d say it was enough! \n\nThey send another big long, multi paragraphed reply. This time they describe the dog. Where he got the dog. How Jared through Connor was soooo hot, etc and how he was super sorry for knocking Connor over. \n\nI reply describing Connor glaring up at him, getting to his feet, and yelling at him to control his dog.\n\n\u201cI TOLD YOU TO WRITE LONGER!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote everything he did. There isn\u2019t really much more I can do!\u201d\n\n\u201cD E S C R I B E! Haven\u2019t you read a book before? You can\u2019t write for shit. I want at least three paragraphs!\u201d\n\nNow. I\u2019m studying a creative writing degree. I\u2019ve written over 200,000 words of fan fiction in my life, and multiple novel-length original stories.\n\nI don\u2019t consider myself to be a perfect writer, but I KNEW I could write circles around this kid. \n\nI also know that, in my 2am doze. I cannot write a THREE paragraph describing this dude GETTING UP OFF THE FUCKING GROUND. \n\nSo. I left. \n\nI\u2019m guessing this person was young since they had more of a quantity over quality mindset. But still. It made my blood boil. ",

            "selftext": "Title says it all. Also, I wrote this at like, two in the morning. So gimme some slack.\n\nI have a pretty busy life, so I rarely have time to make long responses, my perfect response size being two or three sentences, give or take depending on the moment. I like to go bare-bones, describing my characters immediate actions, thoughts, sensations, etc to the moment and according to my partner\u2019s responses. This was a lot more casual and easier and could allow for much greater escapism. \n\nNow, the only one-liners are illiterate knobs who can\u2019t spell \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d and everyone else writes pages upon pages. I remember finding tons of great &lt;1 paragraph roleplayers on Kik and a while ago on Discord, but now there\u2019s basically none, and I\u2019m being forced to have longer responses.  I\u2019m personally equating this to one main thing.\n\nThat thing is that I could\u2019ve had lower standards before, even if I don\u2019t notice right now, and those I deem unworthy now (bad spelling, weird prose, etc) I might not have noticed before. Now that I have more expertise, I recognize that, the majority of the time, roleplayers who have been around longer have longer posts. Being around longer also means higher quality, generally speaking. So larger posts tends to equal higher quality, in general. Which sucks for people like me.",

I'm currently active on one group roleplay and I have couple of characters there. The issue is, no one seems to want to interact with my characters. At all. If I suggest some possible plots, I usually get turned down or the other person replies with a really disinterested tone.\n\nNo one ever seems to remember my characters at all when I participate in OOC conversation.\n\nAt first I thought this was because I was new, but it has only gotten worse as time has passed. And even newbies that have arrived long after me have managed to integrate their characters into the community.\n\nI have tried to be active, I have tried to participate in OOC stuff where we talk about our characters, I have tried to throw plots around.\n\nI think my characters are simply boring? But honestly, I have no idea how to make them better. The setting is action heavy post-apocalyptic RP.\n\nCharacter 1 summarized: a young-ish girl, who's a bit nerdy and socially reserved (not super shy, just... rather eccentric when she's nervous to interact with someone). She loves stuff like old board games, books, comics and card games. She's kind, but has a sassy, slightly sarcastic edge too. She's not a girly and when it comes to romance she's useless.\n\nShe loves to tinker with stuff and has a strategic mind once she fully focuses on something. My idea for this character was to slowly develop her into being less reserved and more confident. She grew up in a shelter and was just recently thrown into the post-apocalyptic wasteland. She has a subplot where she's trying to locate a missing family member.\n\nShe's the more problematic one since it seems that no one wants to plot with her. The select few who I have rp'd with using her have generally liked her quite a bit so maybe she is salvageable?\n\nMost of the characters in this roleplay are male and the few females we have are really different from my character. They are more aggressive, more feminine and they seem to have several romantic sub-plots going on.\n\n(I'm sorry for butchering English language, I'm not a native speaker myself)",

            "selftext": "After a year, I thought it was time to finish this damn trilogy of fuckery! This is the story of a SWTOR Guild long ago, in an update far, far away...\n\nRecaps:\n\nEpisode 1 - The Phantom Sue - https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/66uh89/fail_wars_episode_1_the_phantom_sue/\n\nEpisode 2 - Attack of the Drone - https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/69k81w/fail_wars_episode_2_attack_of_the_drones/\n\nShitty Cast List Nick Names:\nClint - The Phantom Sue, A-Class whiner, B-Class passive aggressive jab fest, friends in high places.\n\nFeeder - The Doormat, GM in Clint's pocket, likes to throw his weight around.\n\nRuth - The Prophet, a veteran of Clint's bullshit, likes cheese, hates cats.\n\nStint - The Widower, Clint's husband, Clint 2.0\n\nSo, when we left off, Clint had left in a fit of rage after I was not punished for my character cleaning up her mess. A few weeks later, a new member joined who claimed to be Clint's husband, who had been appalled by how his wife had been treated...\n\nTaking a poll here, who finds it a bit suspicious that he joined the guild while saying how appalled he is at the Guild's attitude?\n\nWe will refer to him as Stint, though calling him Clint would be easy since he seemed to carry himself in the EXACT same way from OOC passive-aggressive bitching to IC sue-ness and incompetence. \n\nHe played his Sith Lord, a highly respected Darth who'd fought in so many battles and won so many planets before she graced our order with her presence. Same deal, different funny name. \n\nThe weird thing about the way Stint acted is that with the way he talked to me and Ruth, if you didn't know any better, it was like we had some sort of prior relationship with one another. You know, like he'd argued with us before, especially when he starts coming up with some very familiar nick names and ways of insulting my character IC. \n\nYeah, it's almost like he was there for all of our conversations with Clint. We confront him on this and he simply says he'd been told by his wife about us and had watched her play a few times. Now, this is plausible, I will admit, but I find the idea that he apparently sat through EVERY conversation we'd ever had to have all these inside knowledge rather odd.\n\nThrough out the RP, my sith and his sith naturally didn't get along, especially when my Sith started to point out how a lot of the techniques his Sith used seemed like renamed jedi techniques. So, IC my Sith and Ruth started to suspect that we might have a jedi in our midst, though Feeder simply scoffed and said \"This is just silly. Now, would you start doubting my standing as a Sith if I started to shoot pink or gold lightning instead of blue?\" which wasn't really the point.\n\nLater down the line our guild finds ourselves in the midst of a conspiracy storyline, with my master and me tasked with seeking out traitors in our ranks. For this event, some of us made alt characters to act as traitors for it that were working for a few republic guilds, which also led to me having my imperial agent act as a double agent and infiltrate another major republic guild.\n\nNow, Stint seemed to take some bizarre obsession with going on about how I was clearly not dedicated to the guild because I wasn't on enough. I was on a lot back then, but I was using that time to work on my Agent's infiltration mission, getting wrapped up in a rep guild's plot where  I had to help a Jedi Master survive a temple of traps and mayhem since his padawan was out doing important work. It was some nice stuff, especially since this guild did know about the Imp guild I was apart of and we'd get into situations where I'd almost get found out.\n\nI refrained from telling Stint what I was using my time for since I didn't want to risk him trying to find my character on the rep side and expose him, thus using metagaming to completely ruin my RP. Little did I know that this decision would be crucial.\n\nDuring the height of my agent's infiltration, we reached a point where we actually encountered my imp guild, two strike teams competing to collect some vital data. Stint and Ruth were apart of the strike team, but luckily nobody but Ruth knew I was there since the rep alt I used as my agent's double identity had a different name and wore a mask.\n\nStint pulled off his usual stick, listing off his achievements, gloating about all the shit he'd do to the reps, cutting off one team member's leg and overall wanking themselves off. Problem here for the Rep squad was that we hadn't been built for a PvP encounter and Stint was five levels over us (If I remember right, he'd preordered an expansion, thus was allowed to level up their character to the latest level cap three days before the release). Now, the rest of the Empire players OOC were willing to let this be a roll fight since they saw the odds as too unfair, but Stint, as the leader of this strike team said that we all had to PvP it out.\n\nI looked at this situation, I took a moment to think and then I came up with a plan. I contacted Ruth outside of the game and made some arrangements. In-game, I made a bet, if I could beat hum in a PvP battle, then we do things their way, but if I win, we go the roll route. He agreed and in character, the two engaged, him spouting off lines about a lowly non-force user daring to stand up to a god. Ruth's character pretends to try and help, but Stint just says \"I don't need help squashing a fly\"\n\nNow, time to mention what I left out:\nThis encounter took place on a bridge.\nI had a knockback ability.\n\nSo, Stint lost the fight due to fall damage and the rolled encounter proceeded. The roleplay ended with my character retrieving the data, but just so 'happening' to drop it in a one-on-one encounter with Ruth and our group gets out of there safely. Ruth gets to bring home the data and get credit while me and the team get praise for making the best of a sticky situation; win-win.\n\nStint would not let us hear the end of it for a week, complaining about that 'dumb rep cheater', which I thought nothing of until the Rep Guild officer whispered me to ask about the encounter. He wanted my view of what went down to determine if I'd acted unfairly or like a dick since someone complained. He found that I was in the right there and I was confused, had someone come to him complaining about my ploy back at the event? I asked all others who were present and they hadn't complained or anything.\n\nIt all clicked into place when his Padawan returned to the guild. Oh yeah, Stint was a double agent as well. Both IC and OOC, he said some mighty shitty things about the other guild, gave away guild secrets, talked about some private guild matters and generally said a lot of stuff they'd not want the imp guild mates to hear. Good thing that there wasn't a double agent sitting in the corner of the room laughing at these chat entries and taking pictures. What's even weirder is that this person, who is OOC referred to as a girl, seems to act like they're single, not married. Weird.\n\nI'm ecstatic. I tell Ruth about my findings and we are so ready to build this case and throw it in Stint's face, especially since it revealed that Ruth and my Sith were 100% right in their suspicion that Stint was a jedi. \n\nNow, I didn't want to just send off what I had and let Feeder find a way to wave it off easily. I waited, patiently writing down the shit spewed as well as even initiating conversations with the oblivious Stint that could lead to him talking about the guild and revealing some damning evidence. I wanted this confrontation to be air tight, with the right evidence, the right time and the ears of all the officers to hear it.\n\nHowever, it seemed I waited too long.\n\nAnother person joined the Imp Guild and they seemed nice enough, though seemed a bit sensitive at times. During their introduction to the guild where they were talking about their character, I asked about a possible lore mistake they made (They wanted their character to know Forcewalking, which lorewise should be quite unlikely for a random young sith to learn considering how much shit the Inquisitor in SWTOR's story had to go through to learn it.), emphasis on asked. I didn't insult, I wasn't forceful, I was acting like it was a big deal, I just asked \"Could she really learn that?\" and that set the newbie off a little.\n\nShe said she felt attacked and that I was trying to control her and before I could try and interject or even say sorry, Stint starts stirring up the pot and reveals he'd been telling Newbie all about me and to watch out for me. This spiraling into a bigger argument where he kept goading the newbie on and make out my question as a bigger thing than it actually was, saying how I 'bullied' his wife off out of the guild, leading to the newbie going that if someone like me is allowed in the guild then this guild isn't good enough for her and she quits. \n\nA few minutes later Feeder, the only Mod online at that moment, kicks me without hesitation. So, the next day, I go 'fuck it' and post a big post on the guild's forums with all the shit that Stint's been doing both IC and OOC. With that, I say they'll never hear from me again and that I wish them good luck.\n\nRuth gave me a play-by-play of the reaction when the guild read the post. OOC, some people were pretty fucking livid, especially one mod upon seeing one of Stint's convos in the Rep guild was making fun of a hard time he'd been going through in RL during his guild time, bad mouthing some of the GM's friends and family and that's not to mention all the bold faced lies he'd been saying as well as talking about some of the shit Feeder had been pulling.\n\nHe was kicked along with Feeder, IC he was executed and my characters were written off as going into a special mission on the other side of the galaxy since wasn't coming back to the guild.\n\nAnd so ends the epic saga of bullshit, convenience, triumph and bittersweet defeat. Though many questions are left behind: Was Stint really Clint all along or was he just a real shitty husband? What had Feeder been doing that Stint was referring too? Where was the cheese promised at the start of the first episode post?",

            "selftext": "I've had this dilemma for a while now. And it's not so much a problem because I've just gone ahead and made my choice to not continue RPing unless something changes down the road. But I wonder if I'm being insensitive, or jumping the gun in regards to my decision making.\n\nThere have been a couple of people I briefly talked to, one from a group server on Discord, the other from a 1-on-1 I'd posted a while back. Both of these people are fine writers and we get along more or less. One of them I do not actively RP with, although we used to throw ideas around and chat in a group setting. We are not close and have not actually written together, although I'd been open to the idea. But during the past couple of months, I've noticed that I haven't really wanted to shoot the shit OOC, yet he will continuously DM me. I don't know why, but the more messages I get, the more irritated I get. I can't fathom why this would affect anything we could potentially write together, but the sensation I get of clinginess makes me not want to collaborate (maybe because of the kind of interactions I foresee).Does that make me a bad writer to not even consider writing with him because of this reason alone? Here's a [screencap](https://imgur.com/a/KmyPzBP). \n\nAnother instance is a partner I got two posts into a RP with. Great writer, experienced. But I find that chatting with him OOC feels somewhat stifling. Messages me literally the second I log on, and will keep messaging me even after I've mentioned I need to go do something, or that I'm out out (and on my phone), or semi-busy, etc. Many of the times, I'm \"online\" on Discord, but I may not have time to actually buckle down and write. I get the feeling he understands that, but that doesn't seem to stop him to pestering me for a post. Without being prompted, I typically do reply in a timely manner. But as soon as I feel pressured, I no longer feel the desire to write. \n\nI don't know if I'm being an asshole. Is it okay to let how I feel about these people OOC affect our RPs? Is it selfish? Is it strange that I feel majorly turned off by what I *perceive* to be clinginess, but could just be over eagerness? I guess it seems to skew the former just because there appears to be a lack of respect for space, but I'm not sure.",

They are nice enough, they aren't downright mean but there's just something about them that gets under my skin. They are super sarcastic about everything and for me, it just gets old really fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that no one in our group particularly likes them but no one has the guts to say anything because they aren't being traditionally toxic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir writing style is also super weird. It's not bad, but it's somehow really exhausting to read. Also, their characters are just plain horrible but apparently they think their characters are the best thing ever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, they posted a wanted add yesterday for some random side plot character and idk, the whole add is one badrperstory. Can't copy it here since our RP is rather popular and I'm sure someone would recognize them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo TLDR; our new member is loud, asshole-ish and annoying edgelord who writes godawful characters.
