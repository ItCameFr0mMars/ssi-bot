I know for a fact that they're interested in the plot that I have because the told me so, but I'm just not sure if they're motivated? \n\nIt's on Discord, so I can tell that they are online, listening to Spotify, or playing Dead by Daylight, so they aren't busy with important life things.\n\nI don't know if I should ask if something's wrong or ask to be more of a priority...? I don't know. It feels like I'm being selfish when I want people to reply more often. \n\nWe aren't even doing things that are full multiple paragraphs, just about three sentences.\n\nI'll probably end up not doing anything.",
