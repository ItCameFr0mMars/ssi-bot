            "selftext": "I've never been super great at social skills, but these two situations have me feeling unsure.\n\n1. Encountered a seemingly great match in a big rp portal site. They shared multiple very narrow interests, some so narrow that in 30 months I've never seen another with them. Yet , during our meet-n-greet conversation, she gave me these lines:\n\n&gt;Well, I don't see any reason our character or interests are incompatiable in too many ways\n\n&gt;Oh, I am not disinterested or anything \n\nMoreover, I asked her about 10 questions about her RP interests while she asked 1 of me.\n\nTo me this has a huge subtext of \"I am not interested, not excited.\" Am I reading this wrong?\n\n2. One of my longest-time partners (off and on about 8 years) has clearly told me that she has always had mental health challenges. She has also made it very clear through statements that I am her one and only roleplay partner, and yet, she has many types of interests in more dark and violent scenes that she consistently will try to swing me towards--clearly with no ill intent--but that I've repeatedly said I am not interested in. I feel great long-standing affection for her as a friend and I do love our dozens of stories that we've done in well-matched content areas. Yet she has said she's had stalkers in the past and doesn't trust anyone else for roleplay. Should I keep encouraging her to find partners for her dark scene desires, or let it rest?",

I have tons of  bad role plays happen to me, and thought i'd finally post them on here! so couldn't find the screenshots for this, but If I do i'll post those, too. For context this happened on devaintart (I know, I know, cringe, but I've been on there for over eight years and didn't want to leave because it felt like my home and where I made a ton of \"friends\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo before we start, I want to introduce this guy i'll be talking about. He had been my friend for devaintart for over 6 years (I believe, I can't remember how long ago it really was but it's close). He has always been a bit weird but I was more weird when I met him, so, no problem, right? There really wasn't, he was super nice to me and I really looked up to him, even though we weren't far apart (not sure if that actually is true because you know people online have a tenancy of being dishonest). I may not remember this all since it's  been.\n\nRPP =  role play  Me is me,\n\n(This role play was already weeks into already by the way , and since I didn't have a lot of time, I stuck to short answers and I also don't remember this very well)\n\n( -()- indicates small notes I forgot to add)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe;  \\*(My OC) was in the kitchen, making breakfast for all of them -(His OCs and some of my OCs lived together, such as the OC of mine mentioned, his sister and  her adoptive daughter. But it depended on the role play, if they were more, I added more to make it interesting. Also, my Oc's sister's  was RPP's OCS boyfriend, thought that was important to mention, because he tried to have sex with )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
