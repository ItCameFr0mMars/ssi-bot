            "selftext": "So in my character's (asexual male) bio I have CLEARLY stated that this character is not available for romance.  One of our newer members created a straight girl and the player is being so obvious with her plans for \"romance\" subplot for these two it's making me uncomfortable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a gay male and I think this girl has a crush on me. She keeps messaging me for little, unimportant things and she really likes to plot with this one character of mine specifically.  I've tried to politely ignore her and only answer her with brief, polite manner. I have also started to ignore her whenever she talks about her female character (which she does A LOT). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, this might be my own mistake because initially I accepted to plot with her. Now she won't stop talking how our characters had \"great chemistry\" and she's excited for their friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a kind of person who gets extremely anxious when pestered and pushed, she's way too chatty and it's really draining me. I have no idea how she has the enthusiasm to keep it all up when I ignore 90% of her messages. She's also eagerly greeting me whenever I show up in the public Discord channel. She's seriously killing my love for this hobby. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do? She's actually well-liked in our community and I don't want to be rude to her. She is being nice, just... really, really pushy and eager about EVERYTHING. And the way she obsess over our characters honestly creeps me out, I don't think she understands what asexual means. ",

I was semi-okay with this, since most got their points across, and a large portion of characters were actually really well made, grammar and spelling notwithstanding. Anyway, I joined this one community, and the owner is making it clear that he\u2019s the main character right off the bat. This is a list of his races, I swear to God above: Vampiric Dragon God Fox Wolf Human (Egyptian) Elemental Horseman of the Apocalypse Grim Reaper. This guy, he\u2019d pull off some of the most bullshittiest bullshit that I\u2019d ever seen, and would get absolutely PISSED most of the time, for seemingly no reason. Safe to say, I left the very next day, but I honestly wish I could\u2019ve stayed to see what kind of batshit antics the guy would\u2019ve tried. He was completely serious about it all, too.",
