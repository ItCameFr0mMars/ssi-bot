            "selftext": "Soooooo, I think this all started about a few months ago and I had started roleplaying with this girl. I\u2019ll just call her \u201cM.\u201d Everything was great in the beginning, We. Introduced ourselves and trades our kinks and limits and such, back and forth. I saw she had rape as her major kink, but I didn\u2019t mind much. That is, until we actually started roleplaying.  \n\nBefore we get into the actual role play itself, I\u2019d just like to say that this girl was a one-liner. She would send things like (Ex: I smile and push my hair back.) that\u2019s it. That is literally one of her lines that she uses really often. Also, might I add that her grammar was horrendous.\n\nMore Ex:\n\nActual word is Our: She uses Are.\n\nActual word is Since: She uses Seance.\n\nYou see how annoying that is? Maybe it\u2019s just me but that literally on its own, killed the role-play for me. But enough about me  rambling about grammar and one liner issues. Now onto the actual role play.\n\nThe scene was set in a normal modern world. Our characters were college students that were eventually going to become friends and then hopefully go into a relationship. This looks like a very generic and vanilla rp, right? Well.. then you would\u2019ve thought wrong. Remember how I mentioned she had a major kink for rape? Yup, that took place a lot in this rp, and like the trash person am, I stuck through it all. But the rape isn\u2019t really what caught me off guard, it was the fact that she asked so many questions about what should happen to her through out the rp. Lemme give you some more examples that I\u2019m sure you are annoyed of right now. This is a direct quote from her, through the rp.\n\nQuote: I smile and hold your hand. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom.\u201d (Should some old guy come into the bathroom and rape her?)\n\nQuote: I sit at home and paint happily. Are kids running around the house. (Should the adoptive father come and to the house and use her?)\n\nYup.. that\u2019s what I had to go through the entire RP. But in reality, she was such a kind individual, so I couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to say anything to her. Anyways that\u2019s my Bad Rper Story",

            "selftext": "Daily I am on a kinky chatroom website with thousands of people online at any given time. And most of the time I am approached with pretty decent RPers. (Of course, lots of them disappear after setting stuff up or getting a ways in, but I don't really care all that much) Anyways, I encountered my first bad RPer a couple of days ago and I think that this would be a great place to share my story.\n\nSo this guy approaches me. Let's call him N. N has a self-proclaimed six years of RPing experience (I only have about 3 or 4). He approaches me and says that he wants to RP with me. That's cool! I try to RP with any character I can no matter how fundamentally silly their character may be in my character's world. And he requests we do a certain subject. A subject I'm not too comfortable with my character doing. So I request negotiation. He doesn't want any and he just wants to wing it. But after slapping together a simple plot we are on our way. I start with relatively detailed posts, and so does he. But as it goes along, his posts get shorter despite asking him to try and do his best on making long enough posts. Eventually, I slow down as well and shorten my posts because, hey, if he's gonna be lazy, what's the point in me working my butt off? He never appeared to mind it. During the whole ordeal, he was very impatient. He couldn't wait for a minute before poking me and asking where I was, even though I repeatedly said \"Paaatience\". At one point he called me 'trash' because I wasn't doing what he wanted me to do. But he did immediately apologize afterward. And he also requested subjects that I just couldn't accept. And he still continued to push me even after I told him no. The RP ended and we went our separate ways.\n\nThe next day, I log in again and he's online. He appears and he says that he wants to do something else. It's a vore-related RP, and he wants my character to be an aggressive predator who won't take any. But I tell him that that's not how my character acts, and he gets mad. We then get into an argument about how a predator should act. He says that it's not realistic that a predator would be nice and sweet, but I tell him that people can create their characters any way they want to and they don't have to follow real-life rules because everything and everyone on the site is a work of fiction. He eventually dropped the topic, claiming that we have \"a difference of opinion\". I tried dodging RP this time around from my unpleasant previous experience, but I didn't tell him how I felt yet.\n\nDay 3, N comes around once again, and this time he comes with an entire pre-written plotline for us to work with. But after having a poor RP with him last time and an argument our second conversation, alongside with his impatience and attitude, I couldn't continue. And I tried to be as nice as possible with my final rejection. I basically told him, \"I understand you're eager, and I don't want you to take offense to this, but I just don't want to RP with you\". And I started to follow it up with \"It's not just you, it's a bit of me and a bit of you. But I don't think we work together\", but he signed off too quickly, leaving me unable to post the second reply.\n\nA few minutes later he signed back on, giving me this lecture verbatim:\n\n\"Since we are being bruity honest Then here is what I have to say, You are no different then all they all the other trash on this site, You have no regards for people feelings and No ideal of what people like me go through of endlessly being rejected, Some day I hope you go through the the pain of endless rejection then maybe you will understand what it feels like.\n That is all I have to sy  good day...\"\n\nI felt guilty at first. This guy has been endlessly rejected, and he wrote an entire plotline for us to work with. But then I talked with a few of my friends and they agreed that I did the right thing. I rejected him when I said I wasn't having fun and now we both know this. I set him on ignore. Looking back, I can understand why he got rejected so much. I wish him nothing but luck in the future, though, and maybe he'll find someone he can stick with and have a good time with, and do RPs that they both enjoy.",
