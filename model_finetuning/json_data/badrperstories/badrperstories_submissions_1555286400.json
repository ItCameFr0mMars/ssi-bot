            "selftext": "This might be a long one, as so much happened within 4 months. I won't go into every detail, but the beginning might be a bit more detailed to give a better idea/feel for the rest.\n\nI got a pinterest account to finally check out what it was all about (after being frustrated of having to sign up in order to see pictures that kept catching my interest on google). I actually ended up liking all the neat things I kept finding on there that I didn't see anywhere else. And there always seemed to be something new. I didn't really have interest in communicating with anyone on there. But one day I noticed I had a message notification. I checked and saw someone sent me a \"sorry if this is awkward, but I'm just looking for friends\" type of message. So I responded saying it wasn't awkward, and that it was nice to meet her. She seemed like the usual shy person you'd meet online. Which is also how I used to be. So I felt I knew where she was coming from.\n\nWe got to know what each of our interests were, and it seemed Marvel and more specifically Doctor Strange was our main big interest in common. I also happened to have my account name as \"Stephen Strange\" because I prefered to be anonymous, and it still is a current obsession of mine (If you couldn't tell by my username here). XD I was considering doing some rp'ing on tumblr, and I tried a bit earlier, but didn't feel confident enough to be consistent or frequent with it. So I haven't for a few months.   \nAnyway, I ended up mentioning my interest in trying rp'ing on my tumblr account, and she seemed to really like the rp idea, but said she didn't have an account there and suggested we could do it through pinterest messages. I was open to trying it out. I mentioned I might be a bit slower to respond than most people tho. Which she said was fine (obviously wasn't).\n\nI asked if she had any ideas for a story/starter. And she suggested that Stephen would be a jerk to her character, but she would end up saving him, and in return Stephen would apologise for being rude earlier and invite her to the Sanctum. It didn't seem too out of character for Stephen to be a bit rude (tho maybe not so much after him becoming a sorcerer compared to him pre-accident, but I wouldn't doubt he'd have his days, he actually has in recent comics), so I agreed to it. My interpretation of being a jerk/rude btw was Stephen being irritable because of a long line in a store on a busy day, then a monster attacks outside somewhere causing the ground to tremble, making a guy behind him bump into him, which makes him bump into her and dropping all his items. And forgetting to apologise before leaving the store to go see what's going on/what he has to deal with now.\n\nA few times while I was taking some time to process her responses and thinking of how I was going to respond, she'd ooc (out of character) say things like \"hello?\" or \"are you there?\" if I took more than 5-10 minutes to respond. I should mention I have ADD, which makes it a bit difficult for me to be focused and think fast with so many noises and distractions around me. But it wasn't too unbearable for me, and I ended up responding just a few minutes after each time she said that. I figured maybe she'd get used to my average time it took to respond and stop asking (Took me usually no longer than 25 minutes once I opened the messages). I did eventually explain the ADD thing tho. And she said it was fine. But she still remained impatient and even started saying more things like \"I'm just going to assume you're not going to reply\" \"I'm just going to assume you're not active anymore..\", etc.. Especially when her character was crying, full of rage, or confessing love. The pressure was on. Making it harder to for me to think.\n\nI swear she barely slept, and spent maybe like 70-80% of her time obsessively checking to see if I've read her responses. Because no matter if I replied during normal day hours or even 2-6am (hoping I'd have time to think during those hours), she'd notice I opened the message and send one of those \"hello?\" messages within 10-20 minutes. Or would start adding more to the story (including deciding what actions, facial expressions, or words my character would do/say - I did eventually mention how I didn't like that, but she did it right after anyway - that was right before I blocked her). There were at least a few days I didn't see a response for 6 or so hours. But it seemed rare. And we were rp'ing almost every single day.\n\nI did end up asking for a 3 day break for me to catch up on projects I've been putting off (which was true). She first took it as the rp being over, so I had to clarify. She agreed it'd be fine. But during the third day as I was just about ready to message her, I got a message from her asking if we could continue because she was so bored and lonely (this was the day I said I'd be back, so it was a yes anyway). I opened the message and started typing a reply that I'd be ready in a bit, that I was just going to make something to eat first. But before I could type it out, she sent another message. I can't remember the exact words now, but it went something like \"I guess not...\". and before I could respond to that to tell her I was just typing (cuz pinterest doesn't have the feature that shows when someone is typing), she sends another message, and another, and another. Really fast.\n\n\"eh.. nvm.. I'm just a bother to everyone..\" \n\n\"honestly you may never talk to me again\" \n\n\"I'm seriously about to kill myself\" \n\n\"All I wanted was to have some fun.. but I never get to have that..\" \n\n\"It was fun while it lasted\".\n\nI started shaking because I could see how even if she was truly feeling suicidal, she was clearly using that as a way to manipulate me to continue right then and there. So I was concerned, but also upset. Especially since one of my ex's had frequent suicide attempts, plus the pressure of the pushy/impatient need for me to respond INSTANTLY, so that came rushing back to me. I panicked and sent a board full of positive quotes as just SOMETHING to send while I maybe could gather some words in my mind to say without them continuing on like that.\n\nShe of course says how she already went through all of it (it was a board I made previously, so it seems they've been looking through everything I saved.. and I had at least 10-15 boards full of tons of posts, like in the 100's and up.. that or she was lying, but she did notice and mention her noticing I put a ton of autism related posts in my \"my life\" board the day I put them in there, so she seemed to follow me closely.. anyway). She said that none of that was helpful, and I didn't really expect it would be as I too have depression and positive quotes don't really fix anything on their own. So I ask if she really wants to feel better. But she went on to say how nothing ever works, and only rp'ing helps her temporarily. And says how she feels like she forces people to rp with her (Can she really not see why? She has to be playing dumb I think, trying to trick even herself). I mention she can talk to me about anything if she feels comfortable opening up about it. But she just says \"I won't force you\". So I instead just try to start sharing some things that helped me put my depression into perspective and to practice coping with/managing my depressive states (taking a step back from destructive and painful thought loops to observe it from a third person perspective and/or look at it as though you're about to help a friend with those feelings/situations. To be kind, patient, and caring towards yourself as you would towards a friend, etc..). But she ignores what I say and says \"I still won't force you\". I ignore that to continue explaining the rest of what I had to say, and again she completely ignores what I say and says it again \"I'm not gonna force you\". I'm aware this is clearly manipulation. I figure since she won't listen to what I'm saying ooc, maybe bringing some of these techniques in a more drawn out magical/fantasy type scenario might help spark some helpful results for healthier mental patterns, even if they click in further in life. Especially since I'm rp'ing as Doctor Strange, and these kinds of things fits to what he helps with. So I just give up and say we'll continue the rp. And we do.\n\nHer character ended up being the sister of Kaecilius. And while being hesitant to say I knew him and why she hasn't heard from him for years, she stops being a character who doesn't know what could have possibly happened to him, and suddenly knows he was turned into a mindless one and was in the Dark Dimension. \"He...he became a villain...didn't he? He got in trouble...didn't he? He's a...Mindless One...\" \"Isn't he?\". And starts saying how her brother told her all about his plans with Dormammu and for the Ancient One. I eventually end up bringing him back and reverting him back to human. They're happy to reunite, he says he saw now how he was wrong and how he learned his lesson, etc.. \n\nThen once Kaecilius is back to normal, apparently there was some time they both spoke together and she told him about her crush on Stephen. Because Kaecilius had a talk with me/Stephen about her MASSIVE crush on him. That once he saved her brother, she fell for him. And to give her a chance. She had high standards, and apparently Stephen fit them all (despite just meeting him literally yesterday), how patient she'd be with his shaking hands, how she had an abusive ex, and if he ever found him, he'd kill him. And if Stephen ever hurt her, \"expect to be hurt and left in a ditch to die\". I open the message to read this long full page of her responses and try to process how to respond before getting \"I'm just going to assume you're busy rn\".\n\nI explain how I may not be ready or healthy enough for a relationship yet. So Kaecilius goes on about how patient, gentle, is a good listener, won't ignore me, will hold me if something's wrong, be there, and trusts me, etc.. to just give her a chance and open up to her because she really likes me. Another long full page for me to process. And before I can respond within 5 minutes of opening to begin responding: \"I'm just going to assume you're not active anymore..\"\n\nThat's when I explained my ADD situation. They're response \"That's fine. Continue when you want\"\n\nThis is getting long. I apologize. But basically I soon ended up explaining ooc that I wasn't ready to rp as Stephen in a relationship because of me trying to get over a past relationship experience. And they said they \"weren't expecting something different\" (they totally were expecting the relationship thing to happen). And when I asked for a suggestion they might have for an ending, they said maybe Stephen saying he needs more time. So that's what I did, hoping it'd be in the past. But from now on, she gets more huggy than I hoped. She starts saying actions my character does, such as not letting go of a hug, him having a sad face, him crying (that happened often apparently), him begging her to stay, etc.. First couple times I wasn't sure if this was a common thing people did in rp's (I'm still new to rp'ing), so I tried to run along with it, but change it as much as I could to what I felt I'd have him do. I didn't like the thought of doing it myself tho, so I avoided doing that with her characters. Just stuck to controlling my own.\n\nBut the crying happened a lot. Not only did she make Stephen cry over so many things out of my control, but every character she played would have a tendency to cry over many things. Some understandable. But almost every single situation lead up to her characters balling their faces off and running away. And then another character rushing in, in full rage assuming that one of my characters hurt one of hers when they didn't.\n\nExample: Her character opened up about her missing Kaecilius for so long, she started crying, then leaves apologizing cuz she's emotional. Kaecilius heard her crying and came storming in shouting \"WHAT DID YOU DO!?\" I haven't opened the messages yet because I was busy doing chores, so she adds on to the story without giving me a chance to have my part in it, Stephen is apparently not responding, so Kaecilius slams his fist against the wall, then he comes up to Stephen ready to pound his face in while screaming again asking what he did to her. I finally open the messages to explain that she was just worried about him and cared about him. So Kaecilius then apologises and runs off balling his face off because he overreacted.\n\nThis type of scenario happened many times, but between different characters. Always leaving me to run after and cater to them. Each time, they kept running further and further too, for me to chase even more.\n\nThe relationship thing was brought up again. 2nd time I explained ooc that I wanted to focus on just a friendship based rp. they said they had no idea how to do a friendship rp, because they had no friends. I explained I had trouble making friends too, so maybe we could figure out how to do it together. So we continued. More drama. Some few nice moments. Some a bit fun.\n\nThen later on they ended up being a shapeshifter. They kept thinking I wouldn't accept her for being one. But I explained how my last name was Strange, and I've encountered much weirder things. She was going to help me learn how to shapeshift better, because I wasn't very good at it yet, but I wanted to finish just TWO pages left of a book I didn't get to finish earlier. After her deciding I used her as a foot rest while she was a tiger and saying \"I'm used to it\" (I removed my feet right after because I didn't feel it was something I'd do), I suggested she sit next to me instead while I finished just two pages of a book. I figured it'd just be a quick Stephen read the two remaining pages in a short time, then closed the book and was ready to practice shapeshifting. But her character went all \"I was excited to teach you something, but I guess that won't happen..\" and went to run off crying. But I stopped her and said I thought it'd be nice to just enjoy the peace and quiet for a few minutes together. So she stopped and turned around.. but she wrote that she sat there all upset next to me for HOURS while I read the book. I don't know about anyone else, but it doesn't take me hours to read two pages. But whatever, I closed the book and then she was excited to do the shapeshifting thing.\n\nAnd not long later on, she ended up being an alpha dragon and she said she chose me as her mate. That it was some very special honor to be chosen by an alpha and whatnot. I had to politely decline and explain that I again was not ready for a relationship, and that it's not right for her to feel like she should wait for me to be ready. That we should just be friends. Her character accepted that, but then Kaecilius brought up the mate thing and asked if we were official now. I explained to him about what I told her. Then he said he wanted to give me some advice. He told a story about how he lost his wife and kids in a car accident, and that her life could end any day too, so to not miss my chance with a my future wife. Stephen is cannonly known to have lost all his family. His sister, then his mom, then his dad, then his brother who was visiting him upset he didn't make it to their dads funeral, died right after he left, by a drunk driver. So I mentioned this and said that I was very aware of how quick life can go, and that I don't take current relationships lightly. But that also was a reason to not have her hanging on waiting and hoping they'd end up together for years of uncertainty of being ready for a relationship. Kaecilius kept going on and on about how great of a person she is, and how great Stephen was. I could see they weren't getting my hint, and were just becoming more pushy. So I had to go ooc again to explain that I can't do the relationship thing. to which their response was only \"Oh..\" as if she completely forgot or had no idea I didn't feel comfortable doing that. And wanted me to feel guilty for not doing it. \"I'll just reword it then...\" and Kaecilius said \"I tried to give you advice..\" \"Just be kind when you tell her then.. might as well get it over with..\"\n\nSo I as politely as possible once again turned her down. And of course.... she ran of balling her face off. But apparently I begged her to stay. This is when I realised this isn't a common rp thing, or at least it wasn't something I was comfortable with anymore. So I went ooc to say I didn't like her deciding my characters actions or what he said. Her response \"sorry..\" \"I had no problem when you did it with mine but...alright...\" \"I'll just go for a while\". I simply said that I don't remember doing it with hers, but if she caught me doing it to let me know.\n\nAnd literally... a few moments later... she decided Stephen had a deranged face after she ran off and slammed a door in his face because she was upset he didn't want a pet dragon. (Baby dragons flew into the sanctum, and my other character thought they were cute and wanted one. But she was expecting Stephen would want one too.)\n\nBut that's right around when I sent one last ooc message explaining how some of the rp was fun, but that I was done because me being a temporary fix may have done her more harm than good. And I didn't say it, tho maybe I should have, but I was done with her continuously not respecting my boundaries. I already knew she'd probably use suicide threats to me ending our interactions, so I also included a link to the pinterest help page for those who are suicidal, wished her the best to finding a healthier path, and then blocked her.\n\nPinterest doesn't let you know you're blocked by someone, and you can continue sending messages and it'll look like they went through. But I can't see what they are. The entire messages between us actually disappears on my end. Which is why I can't go back and re-read for exact detail and order. I only have so many screenshots from it. But she would have noticed I blocked her once she visited my page to see she couldn't interact with my boards.\n\nBut yeah. That was an experience. I haven't rp'ed for about a month now. And am unsure if I want to get back into it for a while. At least one good thing I feel came out of it. Me learning to work on standing up for myself better, setting boundaries sooner, and not putting up with stuff for that long. \n\nIf you actually read all that, thanks. And I hope it wasn't too frustrating. XD I hope none of you have to deal with anything similar.",

            "selftext": "First off, let me give you some background, since this is more a case of non-existent planning and just generally bad RPing. All of this happened about half a year ago, I believe, in Warhammer 40k place that does long form and tries to stick to the lore and spirit of the universe. So meme characters are generally not a thing, and people are expected to at least put *some* effort into the arcs they write. \n\nSo here's the OOC bit. The other guy, let's call him Alpharius, approached me OOC and asked, if his character could join my character's crew. I've had some relatively bad experiences with this type of thing in the past, but didn't want to be a dick, so I skirted around the issue for a bit. But since Alpharius kept asking I finally went with \u2018if you can convince my character IC.\u2019\n\nSo we set up a loose idea for the arc. My character would come attack a spaceship and find the other guy who'd been stowing away on it there. Negotiations would happen from there. At this point it's important to know that the other guy was from a faction well known to be spies, infiltrators and backstabbers. They like to use the equipment and colours of other groups, can change their looks (with some surgical help), are trained to adopt other people's quirks\u2026 the whole nine yards.\n\nAll of that would have made for a really cool infiltration story, I believe.\n\nBut things IC went a bit differently.\n\nWhen my characters made it to the ship's command centre, Alpharius's character was already there, wearing repainted gear almost unique to his faction and waiting for my guys to turn up. After greeting my character, he proceeded to tell him how he'd stowed away on the ship weeks in advance to meet the guy in order to join him. He stated he was experienced in infiltration, back to back with asking my guy to let him have a small command. All without even saying his real name. \n\nDue to the quite obvious clues my character immediately suspected what faction Alpharius's character was from. As one would expect when dealing with someone from a group known for infiltration, he became very careful and suspicious. So when my guy asked for an explanation and did not immediately go along with this IC very suspicious (and not very logical) thing, the other player simply stopped responding.\n\nWhile it's not as bad as some of the other stuff on here, it bothered me a lot at the time, especially since I put quite a bit of effort into the setup. But oh well, I guess.",
