            "selftext": "And by getting shoehorned into it, I really meant getting two posts into our roleplay before I brought the guillotine down on it. I can't believe it still took me two posts into it before I *really* realized what he was doing. \n\nThis writer had responded to my ad some few weeks ago. I had time, so I entertained the idea, getting a feel of his writing and experience. It seemed like a really good match and he pointed out one of my prompts: a sci-fi setting with the basic premise of an colonization expedition gone wrong on a hostile planet. Something akin to The Thing or Alien, with mild horror elements. \n\nAnd then came the strange requests. He pointed out that he enjoyed \"epic romances\" and a good amount of smut. \n\n*I said: Story, then smut.*\n\n*He said: Fine. I'll manage.* \n\n*Me: Great.* \n\n*Him: Would you be open to playing a virgin?*\n\n*Me: Maybe. Why?*\n\n*Him: \\[Something about the special nature of being one's first time, possession, other stuff.\\]*\n\n*Me: Sure, I'll bite.*\n\nAnd then before we even started he'd mention how his character would be in love with mine, and that she's his, etc. etc. I really, really dislike shipping characters off the get go. But again, I let it ride. I'd already mentioned that I would be playing someone in their late twenties and probably won't be submissive right off the bat. Sometime later...\n\n*Him: How do you feel about playing her with dyed hair?* \n\n*Me: ...Why?*\n\n*Him: Something about craving a slightly alt girl.*\n\n*Me \\[again, forever accommodating\\]: Sure.* \n\nWhen the RP finally starts going, I realized that the way he set it up it wasn't going to be anything like the original plot I wanted to write at all. He had loosely discussed taking elements from *Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri*, which I was fine with, but when it finally came down to it, he was practically aiming to write it in that universe with the same story. No horror or \"stranded\" elements, nothing like what I had *planned* for it to be. Same names taken from the game in his first post, everything. \n\nThat wasn't even the last straw. I was willing to play ball, up until we were busy introducing our characters pre-mission take off, and his IC post basically said: *My OC is 26, one of the few exceptions of those to board the ship like other security or the Captain and other leaders.* ***Almost everyone was 24 tops****.* I realized then that this fool was trying to force my character, by way of IC information, to be younger than 24. Even though I had already told him my character was going to be late-twenties, and would he still be interested in a romance element if she was older than 26?\n\nI can imagine him sitting there, thinking about how young he wanted his virgin to be, and deciding that anything over 24 was just *too damn old*.",

            "selftext": "So up until last night, I was a part of a non-canon Pern roleplay. Everything was going great until I accidentally posted something triggering on their Discord server. This wouldn't be the first time as several more incidents lead me to getting a third strike (the site uses a three strike system). Eventually, this all lead to me accidentally triggering another user on the Discord server by posting an image and I decided to leave the rp forever with the bondables that I got permission to take offsite. \n\nRecently, I decided to give it one more shot and the first red flag was when I accidentally shared someone else's art with other members of the community. She said that her art must never be reposted, even with credit. I didn't think much of it and moved on. Just this past month, I got the idea to recreate the characters from Ed, Edd n Eddy for this setting and had just finished with Ed. Last night while I was eating at my local Carl's Junior after getting my haircut, the head admin had dm'd me on Discord informing me that I had copied three lines of text from the wiki article on Ed and claimed it was plagiarism. As such, I was permanently banned from the rp and the bondable permissions revoked. I never had an issue with being able to take characters to other Pern rps so this made me extremely angry.\n\nNot only that, but I was punished for simple mistakes, accidental ones at that! They could of just asked me to rewrite the three or so sentences so that it wasn't the same as the wiki, but no, they had to slam the banhammer down on me! I have consulted with other rpers and they agree that not letting me keep the bondables and their strict rules/harsh punishments is extremely unfair.",
