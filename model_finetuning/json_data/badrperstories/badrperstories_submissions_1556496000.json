            "selftext": "I am part of a group that plays a small MMO (ish) that's sort of horror themed in nature.  In this game most of the players are by game mechanics functionally immortal and part of a war of secret societies while dealing with a threat to the world they are slowly losing.   It's a fantastic setting with some story moments that are just phenomenal, though the gameplay is flawed.  It's not unusual to see characters creating their own brand of special power to try and stand out from a crowd of other special people so when I found a group of players, in most games they are called guilds in this one they are known as cabals, that enforced limits and consequences for things I was ecstatic.  To this day i get along well with most of the players, but there was one notable exception that to this day is the most toxic roleplayer I have ever met.  This is her story.\n\nIn a world full of super powered characters she wanted to do something different and decided to have her character in a wheel chair, and made it the focal point of any and all social interactions.  She also had crippling depression and needed people to be nice to her at all times or anything she did was their fault.  Any possible chance she had to be offended by people who could walk she took, any chance too seek special treatment she clamored for, and she'd complain every chance she could about not being able to go out into the field because people weren't thinking about her.  The fact that she designed her character as the literal IT character who coordinated coms and the situation from a safe place didn't matter, it was always our fault.  I know people who are in wheelchairs, this type of portrayal of them as helpless victims who needed everyone to cater to them was beyond offensive and just so so lazy.  \n\nThen there were the powers she -did- give herself, namely technology.  She went out of her way to design impossible things to deal with every thing as it happened, and made her wheelchair capable of turning into a walking fortress, which defied all laws of physics as it simply looked like a normal wheelchair normally.  And she felt her character always had the solution the group should go with at any given time.  During one meeting in her division she threw a fit when her option wasn't considered and tried to sabotage the option that was to prove hers was the better choice.  She even crashed the final climactic battle in a plot arc that spanned a year in a giant mechanized suit she told no one about and left the dm flabbergasted because none of this was agreed too, but she told everyone her character really needed the win because of how depressed she was and she thought it would make a better story for technology to save the day.  \n\nIt's around here that my story with her began.  The first clue I knew there was going to be a problem was when she went out of her way to explain a part of her name to me, it means upper echelons of intelligence and she really wanted me to know how great her character was.  At the start we actually got along pretty well, however there was an IC leadership change and a contest to fill the position opened up.  Now I was really busy with school and I really did not think I was going to win, but I knew IC my character was enough of an ambitious twat to go for it so i gave it my all.  And to everyone's surprise I won.  That's where things got bad very very fast.  Her and another player were involved in a thread that started immediately after my character was supposed to IC be in charge of.  It was at the end of the semester and I was doing a lot of homework but still moving it forward as I could.  I noticed however these two were together hijacking the plot and trying to make this girl the leader of it.  She even ever so nicely messaged me on discord to let me know she \"just noticed that her character has been more of a leader than mine.\"  She also lied to me about the nature of a conversation she had with the leadership and implied the contest wasn't done and she still planned on winning.  So i stopped studying and got involved, a created a whole subplot working in tandem with theirs and had everyone in my group taking directions from me but not letting her know and playing along for now.  I even wrote up a taunting and obvious trap message to provoke her and she flew right into it hard, telling me all of her plans and the many reasons she hated me.  The other person involved in the plot got booted from the cabal for unrelated matters and it died down, which angered her to no end.\n\nThe next thing on the agenda was to show my character she was the real power to be feared in the group and tried to blackmail my character.  The thing was, I just wanted this drama to end.  Rp is meant to be fun, this wasn't fun.  So i made it clear, in the previous plot she'd tried strong-arming other members into bath-mouthing me to leadership, the thing was she approached all my chars friends in the cabal first.  They brought the evidence to me and we put together a plan and got the rest of the leadership to call an inquiry into her behavior so it looked like my character wasn't involved at all.  I held this inquiry and the fact the information she was trying to blackmail me with came from the company server over her head and she still walked right on ahead.  In her mind this could only end with her winning.  So i finally go \"okay, fine, let's do this\" and we set up a meeting.  She chooses the most hilariously menacing time and place to try and intimidate me but my character literally does this for a living, he's fine.  But then she started the god modding. She tried telling me what my character had done in the past to cover up this thing she was trying to blackmail me with, and it was stupid, lazy, and so so insulting.  I politely told her that wasn't how it happened and that there was an entire plot post that detailed what I did.  She got flustered and tried again, but got it hilariously wrong again.  I told her that it was wrong still and she replied \"you can't expect me to actually read a long post to figure out what you did, just tell me here.\"  I was sort of stunned, this was beyond lazy.  I saved the chat log to record this so she couldn't delete it later and tried to explain what I did.  She ignored it and did her own thing again and this time I told her \"fine, that's not what happened and my character is going to know she's obviously lying.\"  I then went and got the leadership to intervene and stop this plot because it was going nowhere fast and she told me over and over again she wasn't going to stop until she won.  It was what her character deserved from this story.\n\nFrom here on out I tried to resolve our conflicts mostly IC when i could, and reached out to the leadership when I couldn't.  Those poor poor people got way more of this fight then anyone could have wanted, but they never really took any steps to end it either.  She on the other hand moved to the OOC arena to try and resolve the fight, filling our discord with near daily insults about me and my character, who she often referred to as the same person.   That's when I realized there really wasn't an OOC separation for her with this character, she'd invested so much into it that it practically was an extension of her, and people who hurt her character hurt her.  For months this drama went on and while I was the main focus of her rage i wasn't the only victim.  She'd lash out at others when I didn't take the bait and just kept being toxic every chance she could.  In on our ongoing plots she would demand to be involved with everything and if I dared bring someone else into the plot to try and get more people involved she'd complain I was trying to control or suppress her.  She'd also try from time to time to godmode me in the most pettiest of ways, taking OOC knowledge and slipping insults into each and every post she made, knowing most other people wouldn't notice them but that I would.  I started dreading waking up in the morning to see what she'd been up to when I was asleep because of the timezone difference with Australia.  A group of other members formed what became known as the \"charname\" support group and they checked in with me like every other day to see how i was doing.  It wasn't that there was a schedule or rotation, that was just how often this person did things.  And she got away with it because leadership was largely active, dealing with personal crisis's, and that only encouraged her to do more.  \n\nHer time with the group finally came to an end when 6 other players gave the leadership an ultimatum, either she leaves or they do, and presented them with evidence of things she'd been up to.  She was finally ejected from the cabal and I thought that would be the end of the story.  But then she approached me to apologize and try to clear the air.  In a moment of insane naivety I said yes.  So she started talking and then launched into an hour and a half long spiel on all the ways in which I was a terrible RP'er and how I was guilty of everything she was and surely I should see she didn't deserve this.  Fun fact, i never lobbied for her to be kicked out of the group but too this day she thinks it's a conspiracy i orchestrated.  I remember just taking screenshots and politely ignoring most things and sent the conversation to leadership when it was done.    That was the last I heard from her for a long long time.  But unbeknownst to everyone in the cabal she wasn't fully gone yet.  We had an ingame chat channel that connected to our general server in discord and people could talk to those playing the game and vice versa.  She'd chosen to stay hidden in the chat and listened in for months.  Around that time the community was going through some drama so I started a post I meant to be helpful on RP do's and dont's and posted it to the community website.  What i did not know what she had been named a moderator for that site and it's discord.  She saw my post and reached out at random at a time she knew I'd be sleeping and left a long message that essentially took credit for the post as she'd said something similar on twitter, though of course she insulted how wordy I'd been.  She then politely as can be asked if I'd be interested in a roleplay where her character could do permanent lasting harm to my character because it would be good story.  She felt her character had gotten a raw deal of things and deserved closure and she wanted some resolution, and she informed me if i was a decent roleplayer I'd agree with her.  I politely turned her down and that's when things escalated.  The following day she started posting in our discord server through the ingame chat channel, calling me out for doing the same things she thinks got her kicked (to this day she thinks she's a victim and did nothing wrong) from the community, and demanded to know why I was still a member while she wasn't.  This was the first time in the cabals history anyone had every done anything remotely like this and we were forced to change our passwords and settings on some things to deal with it.  Since that time there has been no communication between the two of us, though she continues to spin her toxicity in the greater community at large, engineering multiple public shamings of people she believed wronged her in some way.  And every now and then I'm told she still makes a reference to me which I still find funny, it's been over a year now and I'm still in her head being blamed for things.\n\nI have all the logs of every interaction I ever had with her in case she ever slithered back into my life and even organized them into what I dubber her chronicle, because as a VTM fan it just seemed fitting because it was my own personal horror story from hell.",

            "selftext": "Back when MSPARP wasn\u2019t a totally vacant site, I used to be considerably active from about November of 2015 to maybe March of 2016. For those of you who don't know what MSPARP is: it's a forum style website dedicated to mostly homestuck content. While this encounter wasn\u2019t the main reason I left, it was a contributing factor. \n\n\nAt the time, I was 19 years old. I'm \u00a0non binary, but at the time i was still trying to figure out who i was, and used my birth given female pronouns. Most importantly, I'm \u00a0asexual and was already in a relationship. \n\n\nRoleplay was the most popular draw for most users, including me. The only problem was, to roleplay without PMing or using the post format, you had set up individual IM rooms. This was a bit tedious to do, and i couldn\u2019t really use MSPARP on my tablet well. At the time, I thought discord was subpar and it would be too much effort to switch my main form of contact. \u00a0So what I did have, was a skype. \n\n\nI advertised that outside of MSPARP I could use skype- just to make it easier to rp on the go. I did actually find a few people who preferred skype, and they were pretty chill! However, this story isn't about them, it's about the literal incel that weaseled his way into my contacts list. \n\n\nOn MSPARP, he seemed nice enough if not a bit eager. He introduced himself as a young adult and professed interest in a polite way. He started out by bringing up similar interest we had(which i think were only pokemon and rick and morty). He led in casually, and we decided on a basic plot before picking characters. I remember there was a lot of back and forth on using canon characters or OC\u2019s, and we eventually settled on OC\u2019s. He was incredibly insistent on me using one of my non (alternian)troll/non cherub oc\u2019s, and even more specific about this one based off of her design. She dressed in very expensive lacey lolita style clothing and was essentially an archetype of a calm collected rich girl by appearance. \n\n\nI could just be dumb, but at first everything was going alright! We were loosely going with a plot where the Alternians(trolls) were invading Earth. Our OC\u2019s were previously established internet friends, and as the rp went on, incel made no effort to actually establish any real friend-chemistry. What he DID do was give his character a crush on mine, and began to REALLY push for a character relationship. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t have any of my gal\u2019s quadrants filled at the time and I\u2019m okay with tame shipping to at least try it out. However, our characters weren\u2019t even very good FRIENDS at this point. His character was just a generic \u2018cold natured cool guy with violent outburst and a \u2018secret heart of gold\u2019\u2019. He eventually convinced me that If things didn\u2019t go okay i could always RP my way out of the situation. Reluctantly, I had let him establish his character as my gal\u2019s boyfriend for a trial run. I liked the plot we had and was a bit too invested to just let the RP drop over a ship disagreement. \n\nI remember shortly after starting, he asked me if I was dating anyone. I was a bit confused, since I mentioned I was on my profile, and I told him that yeah- I was in a committed relationship with my partner. He made a few comments about how he hoped my partner was a good match because \u2018I was so creative and sweet\u2019 and that he\u2019d love to have a girlfriend like me. \u00a0I thanked him and basically told him he\u2019d probably find someone like that some day. He continued to \u2018joke\u2019 about me and him dating, because i \u2018was his type\u2019. It made me uncomfortable and I let him know. Speaking of him being weird and creepy:\n\n\nEventually, the plot slowed down, and he began acting a bit\u2026weird regarding my character. I often drew the OC\u2019s of people I RPed with, and in turn- my own. Part of my character\u2019s well, character- was she had a crush on pretty much any Troll, and often went through a new crush a week. So there were a lot of drawings of her with her friends gushing about other Troll Oc\u2019s. This guy decides that i have no RIGHT to have MY character talk about any other oc in a relationship with her(even though she was just talking about goofy crushes).\n\n\nI always had to stand firmly that our RP was for fun, their relationships weren\u2019t canon, the trial run wasn\u2019t over yet, and I still didn\u2019t feel any chemistry between our characters. Even in my searching post i always made it abundantly clear that I have difficulty in shipping my characters, and it was unlikely any canon relationships would be added to her sheet unless i was INCREDIBLY impressed. Eventually, he dropped it after I threatened to just stop. He said something about \u2018not wanting to lose an rp partner like\u2019 me, and send an uncomfortable amount of winking emoji\u2019s. I was really stupid to think that\u2019s as bad as it would get. \n\n\nFor a while, everything seemed to be chill. Our characters went through a lot of turmoil and met a lot of helpful characters. It seemed like he was very abhorred to the idea of them gaining any permanent party members. Whatever, that was okay they could always revisit these characters if we needed to right? Well, sometimes he made it very difficult for My character to converse with other characters. His character always initiated the conversations and often treated mine like she was a damsel in distress, unable to do anything on her own. \n\n\nThis bothered me- but I did shoulder my way in to show off my character\u2019s true potential-That she was capable of helping and you know, actually participating in this roleplay. This seemed to upset him during particularly violent battle scenes, like he expected my character to just stand back and let his character take all the credit. I brought it up, and he pretty much admitted to wanting my character to play the role of a grateful cheerleader. I\u2019m quick to point out that is not in her character, and he needs to let me make my own decisions for her. He seems really reluctant, but agrees. \n\n\nA little more roleplay and all seems to be going pretty much okay, he\u2019s dropped his control at least a little bit. He\u2019s still vocal about how he wants her to respond, but doesn\u2019t argue with me when I have her act how you know, how she actually would. I\u2019m finally feeling confident he\u2019s learned, and that\u2019s when he begins to try and have his character FORCE his way onto mine. It got to the point he tried to godmod my character into reciprocating. He attempted to turn the already uncomfortable situation into a very lewd one. \n\n\nOkay. No. Done. I inform him I don\u2019t do ERP with strangers, I hammer in the point i dislike it when others try to control my character(again), and I persist in letting him know I\u2019m getting fed up with him trying to force a romantic relationship between our two characters. They STILL didn\u2019t even have a steady healthy friendship! \u00a0I was frustrated, but I couldn\u2019t find myself to be outright mean to him for it. \n\n\nThis dude full on begs me to not drop the RP, he promises he\u2019ll stop, and that they don\u2019t even have to date if I don\u2019t want them too. I\u2019m a major push over, and I hate making people feel bad- so I suck up my pride and agree. I\u2019m on high alert now though, but slowly I lower my guard.\n\n\nWe actually focused on developing their friendship for a bit in between plot points, but not much. It was still better than before, and my character was actually allowed to interact more with other characters. Around this time, I had been talking homestuck oc\u2019s with my actual partner, and we developed a pale relationship for my gal! She had her pale quadrant filled by my partner\u2019s first homestuck oc(an orangeblood gal). When I updated her sheet- the dude flips out. He goes on about how my character and his were supposed to be best friends, and had the gall to tell me he felt betrayed by this development. \n\n\nI eventually get him to calm down, and let him know that my partner and I made the decision together. I felt kind of bad that it upset him so much, but of COURSE my partner\u2019s oc would take priority! I promise him that for this rp i would leave my partner\u2019s troll oc out of it, my chara and his could be moirails for the rp\u2019s universe. He made a comment around the likes of \u2018So, if I was your partner my characters would get priority?\u2019 and, seemed offended when i brushed over the remark. He brought it up again, and I just sort of replied with a \u2018yeah i guess? But i\u2019m dating my partner so you know: : 0\u2019 to brush it off. He seems to let it go so I stopped thinking about it.\n\n\n\nWe reach a plot point where they steal a ship to escape, and they\u2019re stuck in the ship together. I take the opportunity to try and see if they can grow their friendship more by reflecting on the ordeal they just faced. \u00a0Without even asking, he just decides his character should up and attempt to kiss my character. Nuh uh- not this again. I have her avoid it and express my frustrations. \n\n\nWhen I ask why he thought it was okay to try and force them together again I just get: \u2018Well My character helped her so much, he\u2019s earned it. Besides her pale quadrant is filled, so that leaves her flushed quadrant\u2019. I let him know I can\u2019t do this, and I\u2019m actually done this time (Besides, she also had the ashen quadrant and the pitch quadrant available).\n\n\nHe suddenly goes off into a flurry of complaints, about how he probably liked my character more than my partner, and his character should be priority. He tries to tell me that my partner doesn\u2019t even rp with me, so he\u2019d be a better choice and i should just date him. He calls me a liar and a bitch when I tell him that no, i would NOT leave my partner to date him over the internet. I\u2019m stupid, so i apologized profusely JUST because I was already in a relationship.\n\n\nHe goes on to complain that nobody ever gives him or his character a chance, and only shuts up after i let him know i\u2019m too loyal to just dump a current irl relationship for a long distance one. He says something weird about him appreciating my loyalty more- and continues to whine for what felt like an infinite amount of paragraphs. I left him hanging for two days, not replying at all. He begged me to continue rping and began to say he was sorry for his outburst, and that he\u2019d \u00a0never do it again, that he understood i was in a happy relationship and didn\u2019t want to do erp. Stupid me believed he meant it. \n\n\nWe go back to standard roleplay, ret-conning about a quarter of the roleplay at this point just so their brief romantic relationship no longer exist and no longer gets brought up in the plot. Things were going okay again, but I felt like the rp was losing its flare for me. I was just getting a bit exhausted trying to tiptoe around to keep him from throwing a tantrum. This time I didn\u2019t even have to wait that long before he started in again. \n\n\nHe starts bringing up his complaints with other RPers and how they won\u2019t give his character a second chance like I did. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to be mean and tell him it\u2019s because he tries to force his character and he\u2019s too pushy, so I wind up saying something like \u2018just try discussing things you both want before starting\u2019 or something close. Incel mentions that \u00a0he and I HAD agreed on certain elements and he\u2019s tried that, but nobody ever kept their promises to him. I ask him what he meant, because as far as I was aware- I had never ONCE lied to him or broken our agreement on plot. \n\n\nThis leads into a whole separate fit pertaining to him saying i said we could erp and ship our characters from the start. I had the messages saved on MSPARP, and no- i NEVER said we could, I sent him the screenshots and everything. I\u2019m VERY uncomfortable rping smut with people as is, and this weirdo was being weirdly pushy about it now. I let him know this and he basically begins to plead even more. He starts in with the \u2018i\u2019m 17 i\u2019m mature enough\u2019 thing and no no no. He\u2019s a minor, I don\u2019t WANT to, and now i know he lied to me about BEING a minor. That automatically made this a whole lot weirder. He KNEW I was an adult. He also KNEW I was Asexual, it was in my frickin\u2019 bio. \n\n\nI don\u2019t reply for about \u00a0half a month, but he\u2019s blowing up my skype. Every time I open it I have a slew of messages asking where I was and if I wanted to continue the rp. I wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with this kid. We weren\u2019t on MSPARP so the moderators couldn\u2019t help me settle this, and my partner eventually suggested I just block him. So I did. That\u2019s when he began to fill up my MSPARP inbox instead- now furious that I had blocked him on skype. \n\n\nI remember telling him that I was sorry- and that if he persisted I would ask for mod intervention. He deadass told me \u2018you SHOULD be sorry. You messed with my heart and broke my character\u2019s heart!\u2019 and proceeded to try and FORCE me to continue rp under the blanket of his character committing suicide. Yes- his CHARACTER. He kept letting me know how depressed the ordeal made his character, and how i could fix it by writing my character and his together in a very, uh, active, relationship. He tried to flatter me back into roleplaying, saying things like he bet i was great at saucy rp, or that he\u2019d show me how. \n\n\nNo. I wasn\u2019t going to do that. I apologized for frustrating him, but stood my ground I absolutely did not want to roleplay with him. If he wanted to be overdramatic about his character over a non-canon interaction, that was on him. After I went on a four month hiatus from both skype and MSPARP, I think he got the hint. The last thing he sent me was something about me crawling back and apologizing eventually, because he was a GREAT RP partner, and i would realize that he was better than my current partner, and how he would laugh because i blew my chances to be happy. Yeah, right. Thankfully he didn\u2019t bother me anymore after that, and I moved on to find less creepy RP partners. By the end of all of this, I at least learned a few of the red flags- and to not feel bad saying no to creeps and leaving from the get-go. \n\n\nI feel like there\u2019s a lot of stuff I missed, but this post is already really lengthy. Yes, I\u2019m still with my partner btw- we\u2019re getting married soon and I love them with all of my heart~",

Also why would you do that immediately after him revealing he\u2019d made hundreds of flesh-puppets of himself holy shit that should have been a big turn-off for your char. But it was still in my character\u2019s personality to take physical comfort where he could so I went along with it.\n\nWhat was NOT COOL was you trying to take advantage of my mentally distressed girl who still thinks of herself as an ambulatory spaceship battery.\n\nAnd it was VERY NOT COOL to DELIBERATELY trigger the nobleman\u2019s former slave\u2019s dissociation reflex so you could feel him up without him being able to protest.

None of which involved my character. (That was the whole idea in the first place). Then, as I worked off her responses, I try to find ways that I can put my OC back into the action, just for it to get completely ignored. Then, if the canon character that I\u2019m playing doesn\u2019t react the way she wants it, she corrects me in OoC. I\u2019ve brought it up multiple times that I don\u2019t want to be told how I need to RP and that I would like my character to be apart of the story. But it\u2019s essentially turned into her reading me the story rather than the two of us building a story together. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I just want to block her and move on but I\u2019ve got a lot of time and creativity invested in this story. And I\u2019m not one to just abandon a partner.",
