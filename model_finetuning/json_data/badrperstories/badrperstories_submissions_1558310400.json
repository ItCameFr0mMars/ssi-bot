But then, life got in the way, I figured out I was gay, I started writing more on my own and developing a different style, etc. He kept trying to RP with me lately, and I really, \\*really\\* tried to make it work. Fast forward almost ten years, and I just can't with posts that literally read: \"-smiles-\". Over and over and over again. I can't do it. Not to mention it's based on Sonic, which is very action-adventure-based. I'm very much a more detailed-oriented person these days, but... I dunno. I hated having to end it because we got along, but our tastes and styles became so different. I evolved, he didn't. I just couldn't do it anymore. He still typed like we were thirteen, not mid-twenties, and it came back to me at an almost illiterate level.",

            "selftext": "A while ago I had a server where some guys including me would RP countries in a historical setting. This time we did 1900 as a starting date, and we did accept new members. The guy who played the German Empire had to leave, and we got a new one, who went inactive, and another new one, who liked the concept and had played something similar several times. He did inform me that he had \"permission abusing owner PTSD\" as he called it. I did play the Russian Empire, which is important because Russia and Germany shared a border at the time while being in opposing factions. No problem, because I have several other GMs who can deal with questions and stuff either. His first action in character was declaring war on Belgium and Holland. He took quite some losses while fighting, but he inevitably won as his army was like twenty times Belgium and Holland combined. This somewhat reckless action did cause him to lose some of his reputation because he had basically no valid reason to invade them. From this point it must be mentioned that I had a sytem for annexing small countries, as experience had shown that it is needed to prevent a country from taking over the entire continent through mini wars or diplomatic shit. Anyway, the next random event, which was rolled for, consisted of Austria Hungary splitting up in a lot of independent nations. I, as Russia, immediately starting annexing the one bordering me by diplomacy according to my system, but Germany (I'll just call him that because of rule one) saw a better option. He decided to threaten the newly formed Czech republic with war. I played the Czech republic from that point as GM, and found the good move to forward the threats to other superpowers, which is a fairly reasonable move imo. Despite playing a superpower and needing a good reason to screw over Germany as Russia, I didn't react to the letter. The letter could be seen by all superpowers who received them and Sweden-Norway, who became a superpower a little earlier thus receiving the letter, reacted to Germany with the statement that it should back down. Germany was still too weak to face Sweden-Norway and its allies, so it did as was told. Later he asked me ooc if he could buy Polish land from Russia. I said he should ask that question IC, as it is a character asking another character. The guy did ask me IC and I refused, because I needed the land for both income and fresh conscripts for my army. He then raged the fuck out. \"It's not funny bc u already have so much and u r the owner and u abusing ur position\". I kept on saying no because it made no sense to sell Poland, and then he started ranting again that I am abusing my position and permissions. That went on for a while, and he kept complaining it is unfair and it went on and on and on. I told him to calm the fuck down. He said he needed a break suddenly, and then ranted on. Then I told him to take the break he wanted and enforced that by muting him for a few minutes. He then left. I still regret not having banned him.  \n\n\nPS: I forgot to include a poll I held under players asking if I should allow myself to play a nation or not at his request. He lost the poll 11 to 1.",
