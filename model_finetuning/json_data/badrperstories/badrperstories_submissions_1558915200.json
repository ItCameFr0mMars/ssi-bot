            "selftext": "This story has become a bit of a meme in the place I RP at, and I figured you guys might get a kick out of it too. This whole thing happened a year and a half ago, on a Warhammer 40k place.\n\nFirst of all, let me give you some context. My character at the time was pretty popular around the people playing chaos, and I was mates with most of them both IC and OOC. We had formed a little warband and with the mods brutally neglecting chaos and not really caring about what we were doing, we cooked up our own plot (much to mod annoyance later on). \n\nWhile the lead up to this is pretty stupid in its own right, I\u2019ll cut it out since it\u2019s not all that important. The tl;dr is, that a player\u2019s first character ended up being kidnapped and held prisoner by a member of my character\u2019s warband, and got pretty pissy about it. So he made another character, who was that first character\u2019s long lost brother. His name was Varis. \n\nAs I said above, we were playing in the Warhammer 40k universe, so there\u2019s a **lot** of weird things you can do without people even batting an eye. This character went beyond that. He was a Chaos guy, and a champion of Khorne (the setting\u2019s god of war and skulls and blood and berzerker rage, pretty much). He also wore a purple designer suit, liked to compile notes on things and people wherever he was (at least according to his app; I never saw him do it in character), and had vampire fangs. If you don\u2019t know much about 40k, just believe me that it was pretty damn strange.\n\nSo this guy of course starts planning to get his sister back and made that clear to me OOC. I didn\u2019t really mind. There was some OOC posing about how he\u2019d kill my guy of course, but I honestly didn\u2019t care much. For a while nothing happened, and me and my friends went on plotting.\n\nVaris\u2019s player kept bugging us about it. He also kept being an ass in chat, spamming people\u2019s PMs at a few occasions, and was generally annoying, as well as lore breaking and doing some other shit, like lying about his age. To publically ERP, with another underage guy. He also fought another character and then took over the other player\u2019s actions so Varis would win. \n\nAt this point people started getting fed up.\n\nFor a little context, we were running the warband out of my guy\u2019s crippled ship, and the plot was for a cult that had been brewing on it for a while to spring a massive trap on all the NPCs not involved, kill off a bunch of people and by that trigger a massive ritual that would in the end lead to my guy (against his will IC) becoming a chaos champion. The whole thing was in the works for *ages* and was going to have a ton of players involved.\n\nSo Varis\u2019s player asks if Varis could be involved. I shrugged it off and told him no because there wasn\u2019t exactly a logical reason for it. Then I went to bed. \n\nThe next morning I wake up to a text from another player telling me we\u2019re letting the guy in. I\u2019m pretty confused (and kinda pissed) - at least until he starts laying out the most beautiful revenge plan I\u2019ve ever seen. Funnily enough this guy was the local Word Bearer, so no surprises there.\n\nSo after clearing with this guy that there\u2019s a chance Varis will die, we commence the plot. And oh boy, it was wild and pretty terrible.\n\nVaris and his 500 guys got smuggled onto the creepy chaos ship, and get told by cultists that they\u2019ll have to split up in order to get to get to where they want to go. Unbeknownst to Varis IC, the cult would use him as a distraction to further its own plans. Varis does it, then starts to godmod his way through the ship in the most over the top way I\u2019ve ever seen. The guy writing the cultists had an NPC attack him with a giant fucking hammer hammer, expecting to write a cool miniboss fight. Nope, Varis rips his arm off, bites through his throat and just murders everything else in 2 seconds flat. He starts dodging las-fire and doing all sorts of beyond absurd things.\n\nSo cultist guy gets fed up with that bullshit and just put him on an elevator do dump him in front of my guy for his bossfight. \n\nI ask him if he wants to hash the fight out beforehand, which was a semi common practice to make sure no one got too upset.\n\nHe declines. \n\nSo this mortal with his his 20 man bodyguard ordered into \u2018Guarded Fang Formation\u2019 and his Warp Fangs ready, meet my currently *very* angry Chaos terminator lord. The fight would have been pretty fair and I was ready to just kinda play the cool bossfight for him and bitch out at the last second, should it go wrong for me. After all there\u2019d been a lot of hype over it for the last few weeks with Varis\u2019s player talking about doing cool shit and whatnot. Also, despite the guy being a dick, I didn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable about just murdering his char. \n\nSo the fight finally begins. We have a short scene about the ritual being completed and my guy getting a small powerup, which the other player was aware of from the start. \n\nHe still starts shitting his pants in the chat. \n\nI tell him he\u2019ll be fine with some strategy.\n\nDude says okay.\n\nSo Varis charges my guy. Alone. Completely forgetting about his 20 man guard.\n\nI ask him if he\u2019s sure this is a good idea, which he confirms.\n\n...alright then.\n\nHis character doesn\u2019t draw a weapon, just kinda runs up to my guy and lunges at him. To bite him in the fucking neck. If you\u2019re somewhat familiar with 40k, I\u2019m sure you can tell *why* biting a fully armoured terminator in the neck is a terrible plan. For everyone else, [this is why.](https://www.deviantart.com/penuser/art/Sketch-40K-Terminator-Cross-section-636830438)\n\nSo with me being both disappointed and pretty damn done with this, my character backhands the guy out of the air and takes a moment for some semi-insane laughter at the absurdity of what\u2019s happening. \n\nVaris isn\u2019t having that. \n\nHe gets up again, and instead of getting a weapon or using his 20 guys, just lunges *again* with his vampire teeth. The target this time around? My guy\u2019s leg. \n\nYes. He wanted to bite through a terminator leg.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m beyond done, and with the place having the rule that stupid actions will get you killed, have my character just knee him in the face, give him a post to recover if he wants to, and when he doesn\u2019t, have my guy pick him up and break his neck.\n\nAfter this I noped out of writing bossfights for other people for the a very long time. The entire story became a meme though and I\u2019ve retold it probably a dozen times by now, so there\u2019s that. Varis\u2019s skull also still has a place of honour on my character\u2019s trophy rack, so there\u2019s that.",

So the fight starts and we were having a fun time winning. As I shot it with an arrow from my longbow, nat 20. I finished it off and he proceeded to say. \"The monster crumples to the floor, its blood painting the walls. When you hear a whisper, the spectators body disintegrates as a ghost rises from its ashes. You are now cursed as you are the one who has destroyed its host\" He then said how my character is now chaotic/evil and I start going crazy as the ghost claims me as it's new host. I start arguing with him in the meta. He didn't care that he shouldn't kill off a player character at the beginning of the game. He noticed he was losing the argument and started to insult my character saying \"She deserves to die because her backstory is garbage.\" Fyi she was a hunter who saved her town from a famine. At this point I'd had enough and just left the dnd group altogether.",

            "selftext": "So I was thinking back today on all the forums I've been on, all the good and bad. I remembered all the overtly cliquey places where mods favored certain members or where it was impossible to get my characters foot in the plotting door because everyone had their groups and that was that. \n\nI have two bad examples that have stuck with me.\n\nExample 1:\nI was maturing and just starting out in serious forum RP (previously I had only rp'ed on gaiaonline lol) I had an intense muse for one universe and found a forum that looked nice and in depth to the degree that suited me. \n\nThere were a bunch of red flags which I didn't identify at first because I was quite frankly a noob to forum RP. These red flags included an archive of disapproved applications. These applications might have had a few things the mods didn't like and instead of just working it out with the member they'd simply axe the profile and throw it in the trash with a 'sorry your style doesn't suit us' message for all to see. I also found out that these disapproval's were accompanied with IP bans. Another flag that would be glaringly obvious to me now were the cliques. I noticed members would stick to the same people/groups and most of the mods just roleplayed with eachother. A new member might be lucky enough to gain notice and become absorbed by one of these groups. \n\nNow at the time, I was heavily into this universes lore and had my character come from a group of outcasts that lived in the wilderness and they abandoned children who showed signs of being able to wield magic. I write this profile, state why my character was abandoned and give it no second thought because it's canon lore. \n\nA mod reviews my profile and sends me a message saying it doesn't make sense that this tribe of people would abandon a child for such reasons. \n\nNow, another character with an approved profile came from the same group (they're many and spread out so my character and theirs weren't from the same tribe) and was abandoned in the same way. Her profile had been approved. I message the mod back and state with a level head that the practice in question is in the lore, and then I raised the point of another characters profile being approved while it contained the same lore piece. \n\nSo my profile gets rejected and my IP gets banned. Grrr8.\n\nThat killed my motivation for a while. It didn't help that I had spent a month putting the profile together and was excited about getting stated. I acted normal, joined the forum, posted  welcome message and ruffled no feathers. I assumed all forum RP must be this terrible and didn't attempt anything until a year later where I discovered fantastic communities and realized that other forum was the worst example out there.\n\nExample 2:\nThis next example is pretty short. Joined a forum, created my character and followed the rules of being 'pro-active' and posting in other peoples plotters and was met with dead air. Posted an open thread that had a whole 3 views after 5 days and a mod said she'd rp with me if I posted in her plotter. Weird, but whatever. The place was rife with cliques, the indepth characters with ugly or unconventional looking faceclaims vanished under being ignored. The admin was apparently notorious for having a flavor of the month far as fandom went and abandoning their own forums so it was of no surprise when I left and came back a month later to find the place literally shutdown.\n\nAnyway, share your cliquey stories if ya got any.",

            "selftext": "For clarification, I should probably talk about the rules of this game that matter in this story. \n\nNormal Summons only happen once per turn, and Special Summons can summon monsters whenever you want given that certain requirements are meant. \n\nMonsters like Synchro and Fusion monsters Cam only appear in the Extra Deck, and your regular deck had to have a minimum of 40 cards. \n\n\nNow onto the story. \n\n\nSo I was browsing for some RPs when I found one for Yu-Gi-Oh! I thought it would be fun to dive in so I made my character with her deck and I actually got in! Sweet! \n\nThe story goes on and then one of the characters, we'll call him Frank, challenges me to a duel IC. This is the first time either of us have gotten into a duel in the rp so I was nervous, yet excited! \n\nNow, some backstory for Frank. His bio calls him a 'master duellist' so you would expect his deck to be good right? Wrong. His deck barely has 10 cards, and even that's full of random cards pulled from the game, including 2 MONSTERS BELONGING IN THE EXTRA DECK. Not to mention that some of the cards in his Extra Deck were supposed to be in the Main Deck. \n\nSo Frank's turn comes and the first thing he does is Normal Summon Panther Warrior, seems fair. Then he summons White Ninja? Excuse me, but White Ninja has NOTHING on it that says it can Special Summon itself. \n\nAfter that, Frank plays a Field Spell, Fusion Gate, which allows him to Fusion Summon without a Fusion Card. Then he... Fuses Panther Warrior and White Ninja? Which by the way, can't be done since one, they don't fuse, and two, their Monster Types can't be used in a Fusion Summon since there aren't any in his Extra Deck that requires those Monster types as materials. \n\nThen he summons ANOTHER Monster after Normal Summoning and then he summons a SYNCHRO monster, which CAN'T BE SUMMONED with the deck he has. \n\nThen he summons Winged Dragon of Ra. A monster that can't be summoned unless you tribute 3 Monsters for a Normal Summon, just the cherry on top. \n\nOf course he declares an attack without a target then ends his turn. \n\nI tried to discuss it OOC but he just... doesn't reply. There's also absolutely nothing to work around since his poor excuse of a turn is from a supposed 'master duellist.' \n\nNow, if this was from an rp that had nothing to do with the game, I would actually have little problems with it. However, the ENTIRE POINT of the rp is to be about the game. Why would you join an rp for a game that you clearly have no idea how it works? How did you even get in? \n\nAlso quick question, what the hell should I do in this situation? I don't want to leave since there are some pretty good roleplayers here except for Frank.",

            "selftext": "For those that remember my Karnie Kerrie adventures, I'll get the third part up in a few days. Meanwhile, I want to talk about a phenominon for a bit: character deaths.\n\nI like putting characters out there that die easily. If someone auto-hits my character, I'll oblige and have that character get kerploded into non-existence. If someone power-plays my character, then I'll play along and let that chracter get dragged down into the dark realm.\n\nBasically, I want to see their character's reactions to my character deaths. It tends to be the authors, though.\n\n\"YOU KILLED YOUR OWN CHARACTER OFF, HE SHOULD HAVE LIVED!\"\n\nNow, I'm going to go over all of my character deaths and the methods used to do them:\n\n1. Player 2's Vampire shoots a dark beam that cuts a wing off of a SU-25 jet, causing it to spin out of control. This caused the pilot to black out from the g-force, preventing him from using the ejection lever. Not to mention that the wing is full of fuel and had several dozen bombs mounted to it. Boom.\n\n2. A gunship is spawned by Player 2 with no warning and it shoots at a guy with a submachinegun. Guess who wins?\n\n3. Spikes appear out of nowhere into the character. Big suprise there.\n\n4. Player 2 refuses to stop the gunship from killing another one of my characters for some reason.\n\n5. Player 2 slices my character's arms and legs off. Keep in mind, the server had a \"permission to kill only granted by character owner\" rule.\n\n6. Sun powers. Karnie uses this to melt my character. I'll save the rest of that story for later.\n\n7. A guy decided that he had the power to flip over tanks. These weren't enemy tanks, they were just normal security forces tanks. He flipped them over because he didn't like my character. The commanders were probably sticking out of the turrets, so I'll count this.\n\n8. Some guy decided that he had 400mm cannons to blow up my APCs.\n\n9. Karnie forces me to get a character killed about 20 minutes after he was made. He was supposed to replace the previous character he killed, who replaced a previous character he killed.\n\n10. Karnie kills about 20 guards by melting their equipment with the power of the sun. He later complained that he didn't want to kill them, he just wanted to melt their guns. You know, the ones they were holding.\n\nThat's about it for the non-intentional death stuff. Sure, I could have complained to an admin at some point (1-5 were by a server owner), but I enjoy collecting these bits and pieces.\n\nI now leave it to you guys, what was your dumbest character death?",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna start by saying I made an account on Reddit with the only purpose to vent about this story because that's how much it's making me mad lol.\n\nI want to apologize in advance for any errors, english is not my first language, I'm italian.\n\nP.s. Some details will be changed so others won't recognize it's about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, let's start from the beginning.\n\nI'm in this roleplay forum that has been active for at least 10 years, I joined it two years ago and everything was fine, there were a lot of users, of situations to play and group threads to join.\n\nI don't know if it had already the same problems as now and I was just very excited because it was a new experience, but it sure was more active.\n\nNow instead it feels like nothing ever happens, there are some quest to somewhat move the plot along but they are few and most importantly they never get concluded.\n\nTo make an example: They poisoned the food of a certain race of characters, which alright, cool, the players roleplayed that but then the staff didn't 1. Give a way to other characters to help cure them 2. Didn't give anyone a reason why it had happened on game (or even off game to be fair) 3. Didn't make any of the characters who should have cared, like the police or the goverment, look into it.\n\nThey just poisoned them and then went 'well that was that.' and never brought it up again on game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's how every quest they start goes these days, they throw an idea to us and then they shrug and don't follow through with the logical conclusion of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can imagine the state of the plot of this game, nothing has really changed in it's universe/story for years now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this is a problem, right? Especially when me and other players I talked to hit the rock bottom and end up not being able to write anymore because it all feels too repetitive, no matter what you do with other characters you can mostly just roleplay romance or interpersonal conflict, because there sure isn't any action or danger to look forward to and take part in.\n\nYou can make up your own yeah but... it's not the same. It only affects you and maybe your rp partner, it doesn't change anything in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time me and my rp partner tried to talk about it to the admin, their response was: Well, we won't do anything until September (so four months of nothing...? Okay...) because there aren't many players around now, it's normal, it's almost summer and anyway you're right but in general there's little participation from the users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd... yeah, it's true. But I need you all to understand that there's no participation because we're losing players like flies, othen than not getting new ones.\n\n It's a mess, we haven't gotten any new user that stuck around at least since... 2017 I think. There were a couple who stayed for some months last year but they dropped out along the way, and now a lot of people are somewhat disappearing. Sometimes they pop up once every tot days, sometimes instead you find them in other forum lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome time after they told us that I talked again with a mod about it out of desperation lol, her response was even worse because she basically blamed it all on us players. Using an example of threads that got abandoned by us to prove her point, but the thing was, those quest she used had a span of two, TWO, months between one response from the staff and the other, and I think is frankly normal that if you take two whole months or more (because yeah there are admin who take more, like five months and I'm not exaggerating) to respond and move along the plot users might get disinterested and drop it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, a couple of days ago, me and a two other users decided to talk to the founder because everything about this is stressing us out. She was nicer but basically said a lot of the stuff we offered to do to give the forum new life and help in some way, like updating lists (ex: the occupied faceclaims one) that haven't been updated in years, or publicizing the forum, can't be done because the staff is full of susceptible people and basically they would tear each other apart if we did some of those things and cracked the organization they (don't) have.\n\nDon't ask, I don't even know what the hell they could argue about when it comes to that...\n\nShe then said they are already working on other quest (that they won't finish?) and that she would talk to the staff about our complains/suggestions but it all felt very 'we will consider your request' and 'yeah we take years to do anything plotwise but it's fine' more than a real confirmation she would take the commitment to put more effort into it.\n\nSo now we're waiting to see if they actually \\*do\\* something, but who knows maybe it might be in five months \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if it's all a little confused but it is a true mess.\n\nI needed to vent but also what would you guys do?\n\nIs it a lost cause? Me and four other players are taking other sites to move to in consideration, 'just in case', and as far as I know there are even *other* users who want to leave that we don't know the names of. We all loved this forum and I feel bad thinking of leaving, but in the other hand the situation is what it is.\n\nAdvices?",

            "selftext": "I have a partner, we have several lines.  With different characters/pairings.  I've been starting to notice it more and more, and usually, I'm just kind of miffed by it, but I let it go.  Because I don't want to insult them and I feel it's my fault because I'm at a phase in my time RPing where I don't have inspiration or drive to really write/RP at all.  I told them this, and I told them I'm fine with them having other partners, but I digress because this issue in of itself might warrant its own story here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, writing things for both our RPs and my characters without a heads up/okay from me started as little things that annoyed me.  Like how long they have been dating if they are, to the level of intimacy.  I have actually addressed this with them in the past, as actually writing out the courting/steps in itself gives me a connection/better comprehension and, without mincing words, makes me give a shit about two characters relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it became specifically about what my characters would do in hypothetical situations/conversations about plotting.  As in, them telling me that MY character has done this, or would do this, then to my character's alternate background in an AU RP, because it went with their character/partner.   There was also a point where they pretty much told me how a character of mine met theirs and when, and who initiated the relationship (which was mine).  This particular scenario annoyed me for two reasons:  The character was new, I was still feeling my oats with them, and they gave me..... no room to get that feeling by thinking about how they would react/what they would do in the situation.  Thereby getting a better feel of the character.   The other thing is.... well, based on the character's species, and how they age, my character would have been very underaged.  I brought the latter point to their attention twice, once politely (which they apparently didn't get because they did the math wrong), and the other I was very specific and told them why it made me uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, however, I think I'm at my wit's end, because they did something and I'm not sure if I should confront them, or if I should even be mad/consider it bad roleplaying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a character.  The character has a somewhat tragic backstory that involves someone they knew growing up pretty much screwing her and several of her friends over.  Several of her friends died, and she lost her home and her parents.  I have been pretty vague about this, in character and out.  In character, she has only given a very abridged story.  Lots of details were deliberately omitted, and I specifically didn't even point out who it was.  Hell, without looking back at logs, I have never even specified the character that screwed her over's gender.  This character existed for a sole reason.  This character continued to exist for a reason.  They're a big part of my character's life, albeit in a behind-the-curtains kind of way.  This character and their relationship with mine was essentially the driving force behind making the character deep, and fun to write.  It gave me a reason to want to write her, and develop her as a character.  I had plans for what I wanted to do with this character, with MY character.  And I guess it all went down the toilet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time I roleplayed with this person.............  their character literally handed mine a handful of teeth and said:  \"I took care of him for you.\"  Suffice to say, I was, and am kind of floored by it.  As a writer, I feel like they took it upon themselves to rip out my character's backbone without telling me.  They never asked, OOC, for more details about the character, they never asked/brought it up, because I probably would have at least politely shot the idea down.  And now I don't know what to do.  I don't even want to reply to that post because it upsets me so much OOC to the point I think I would only be able to muster a sentence-long post that culminates to my character saying: \"Gee, thanks.\"  If, you know, it's not exactly that.",
