            "selftext": " I'm honestly confused here. I feel like I held myself pretty well, but the person on the other side of this story seemed like a pretty reasonable guy at first so I'm wondering if I actually did something wrong?\n\nAnyway, here's the context:\n\nOne of my favourite pastimes is online roleplay. I know, I know - roleplay doesn't have the best rep. But the place I use values writing ability and story progression: it's less kids mucking around in the minecraft chat, more writers wanting to expand their abilities and make friends with similar interests. I'm obviously not gonna namedrop the site, though, since this is pretty recent. You don't have to know much about online rp to get this, though it might be helpful.\n\nAnyway, I've done this for a good few years now - since I was pretty young. I've recently come off a year hiatus, though, since I've been working on my education, and upon getting back decided that I wanted to do something Harry Potter.\n\nThe specifics aren't necessary. They could help you find the rp itself, which I don't want. All you need to know is that it blew up pretty quickly, and pretty soon we were waiting on just two more players.\n\nMy opponent here will be called Pink. Pink was the second last to join, and seemed okay at first. They filled out their character sheets and were accepted. They could write well, and their characters were interesting. No warning bells.\n\nThere was a bit of an awkward moment were they DMed me claiming another writer, the last to join us, was taking too long with their sheets. It had been two days. It was a bit annoying at the time, as that sort of thing is generally seen as an assumption that I couldn't do my job as the GM (game master). Especially seeing as the other player would tell me an hour or so later that they had DMed her as well. She was most definitely not in the position to do that. However, I am, by nature, the sort of person who looks for good in people. So I took it as them just being excited to write, and thanked them.\n\nWe talk for a bit, discussing character dynamics. We get along well. The rp starts and people are having fun - it's one of the most active and attentive groups I've been in for a long while, and everyone was very active in OOC (out of character) chats, discussing each other's characters and writing. Pink got their character interacting with mine, and as our characters have very different perspectives things began to heat up. It was fun - in character disputes always are. However, they ended it by having their character give a very long (about three hefty paragraphs) speech essentially shaming my own, assuming my own character's reaction (being, of course, flabbergasted and deeply shamed) then leaving the carriage, closing any chance of my character responding\n\nIf you aren't familiar with rp etiquette, that sorta thing is not typically considered in good fun. Its called god modding - assuming a character's reaction and not giving them the chance to respond, thus forcing the plot a certain way and painting characters that aren't yours in a certain light. I approached them in a manner I consider polite, but just in case I'm mistaken, here are the chat logs:\n\nMe: *Nice post! Be careful you don't god mod, though - you've assumed quite a few of his responses in that post that are rather out of character, and haven't given me the chance to have him respond. That's not always the fairest of moves, in RPs :)*\n\nPink: *She wouldn't give him a chance to respond though. Hit him with a bomb and then leave so he feels badIt's a common girl tactic*\n\nMe: *Hah, perhaps. Just be careful with such long passages in the future, if possible. I don't mind much myself, but I've seen it annoy players in the past.*\n\nPink: *The pause would have been half a second, not long enough for him to interject. I didn't think it necessary to include exactly how long it was.*\n\nMe: *Not the pause - the speech itself, and the way you described his response. Not allowing characters to respond can be infuriating for writers.*\n\nPink: *There is also the fact that another person came in. There was no way in hell she would have continued that conversation in front of someone else. I wouldn't do it normally but having her stay would have been completely out of character for her.*\n\nMe: *I understand that the new character entering the scene was an issue in regards to their conversation, but in that sort of case (wherein it was stated in my post that she entered as soon as he finished speaking) I think perhaps it would have been a good idea to find a way around that sort of thing. In my rps I value continuity, and short blocks of text in order to allow everyone in a scene a chance to contribute. Please note this is nothing against you, but rather a critique as to the way I like my rps to be conducted.*\n\nPink: *Fixed.*\n\nThe post wasn't exactly perfect after their edit, but it was workable and I didn't want to push it, so I thanked them politely and moved on. Afterwards, they were pretty short with me - short sentences, blunt dialect, full stops etc. I didn't say anything until they disappeared for a few days - three, to be precise. It is generally agreed by role players that real life comes first, writing comes second. However, GMs often impose a rule that states writers must tell them if their disappearance is more than a certain amount of days, so that other writers don't have to wait too long, and can move on without a response.\n\nI warned writers before they signed up that I expected such as warning if someone was to disappear for three days or more. And so, when Pink stopped replying and held up the chain, I waited until three days had passed until I contacted them. Here are the logs:\n\n\\*please note they had two characters, and one had been used two days before. I realised this after the first message\\*\n\nMe: *Hey! Just making sure you know the Prefect's compartment is waiting on \\*their character\\**\n\nPink: *I realise but it's only been three days. Kinda putting my job and exams first. Because being able to provide for myself and education is kinda more important*\n\nMe: *Of course - that is understandable. Please remember, though, that I have asked to be informed if anyone is to disappear for three days or more - while RP must always come second, but courtesy to fellow writers is a must as well. Of course, you did reply with your other character not long ago. As long as you know what's happening*\n\nPink: well yeah, I had a few spare minutes so I got a post out. Next time I just won't then if you're going to hold it against me??\n\nAlso, you said that you warn in advance when you disappear for weeks at a time. It's not like I completely disappeared like you said I did get a post out.\n\nI'm sorry I had to work 34 hours in the past three days so I don't starve?? On top of it being exam weeks\n\nMe: *I have been very patient with you, and I expect that you hold yourself correctly when speaking to me. i have held nothing against you: I informed you that we are waiting on your post, as people in OOC are considering what to do as they wait. When you replied, I was polite and understanding, and reassured you that your real life should come first.*\n\n*In the opening post to the IC I stated that I want a warning if someone is to disappear for three days or more. That is information participants were expected to read. In my last reply, I conceded that you had replied in the past couple days, and as such had nothing wrong.*\n\n*It is my exam week as well: I don't expect daily or twice-daily replies. I do expect to be spoken to, though, with respect. Hold yourself carefully.*\n\nAt this point, of course, they had been short with me for a number of days. I felt this was a good point to remind them I was the GM, and as such in charge. Players speak to the GM with respect - that's how rps run.\n\nPink: *I didn't have time! I haven't touched rpn since I posted last.*\n\n*Respect? You think when you stoop to threats that you should be given respect?No, you're acting like a child.You earn respect you can't demand it or try to gain it through threats*\n\n*You have no idea what goes on in a persons life. Frankly, I don't want to be near someone with such little compassion for others and what they are going through*\n\nMe: *Wonderful. Then you shall be removed from this RP's roster. Thank you for your time.*\n\nThey didn't respond.\n\nLater, in the public thread, I said the following:\n\nMe: *I regret to inform the group that I have removed Pink from the RP. Their characters have been removed, though the positions are available. I understand that some people had negotiated outside relationships with Maree's characters, and it will be a bit awkward working around the sudden disappearance continuity-wise. I apologise for the inconvenience. If you have any questions about how to handle it, I'm happy to answer :)*\n\nPeople were a bit bummed, but moved on. Apparently Pink had been telling people in DMs that they had left instead. To this, all I said was:\n\nMe: *They were still involved until just a few minutes ago, just inactive for the past couple days. I don't often remove writers, so don't worry or anything, but I do draw the line eventually*\n\nIt was a way for me to defend myself as having kicked them without coming off as immature. Pink replied to the public thread, saying:\n\nPink: *Hi. I have a right to defend myself so I will. I thought \\*op\\* was treating me unfairly so I left. It is how I feel and there is no changing that.That is all there is to it.They didn't kick me out.*\n\nNo one responded. I'm not a fan of public drama - I find it childish. So all I said is:\n\nMe: *I will not comment on what happened, as it is unprofessional and I don't intend to vilify anyone publicly. If someone is worried that I may be in the wrong and not fit to GM, then please DM me and I'll be happy to openly discuss your concerns*\n\nAnd that was that. I want to make sure that A) I wasn't actually in the wrong, and B) If I indeed wasn't, it didn't come off that way. I have a reputation to uphold to keep this rp moving. I have been as truthful as possible, right down to exact chat logs, so I hope I can get a truthful response.\n\nSorry for the long post. If you got here, thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and salutations, dokis! First attempt at doing this, hopefully all goes well.\n\nBackstory: I'm active on a site called Quotev. It's semi-remote, but it's mostly pretty chill and over my 6 years of being there I've rarely ran into any drama at all! But...there's always gotta be one, right? I'm also a fan of many things, but the one important to this story is Aladdin (and Disney in general). Onto the main event! Apologies if this is kinda long, I can go off on tangents occasionally, hehe. It's namely two, somewhat minor, yet kinda not. I'll explain.\n\nLet's begin with the ballad of GG (I'm kidding). Now, it all began a couple weeks back, about 7 or so. I, for some reason, was really dying to do an Aladdin/Disney RP, and had been trouble finding any groups. I *do* have one of my own, but at the time not many people were joining and I hadn't went for Aladdin for any of the ones before. So, when you see the name of the exact thing you're looking for - I do as all do, I clicked that good ol' *Request Membership* button!\n\nI had made a mistake.\n\nSo, I wait a bit, not expecting it to take too long considering they're already online! A bit goes by, and I get a message. Obviously, I skidaddle my way to my private messages. It's the admin of the group, GG.\n\nThe conversation went down as such: (note - for reasons you'll see, this has to be done from memory as I ended up blocking him)\n\nGG: Hey\n\nMe: Hi!\n\nGG: You joined my group right\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nGG: Did I tell you I only do B x G right (note: for those who don't know, that's boy x girl).\n\nThis set off a red flag in my head. See, I have OCs who are bisexual or lesbians, and I state that openly in my RP information journal. Still, I gave the benefit of the doubt - perhaps he just hasn't got much experience writing it, I tried to think. I thought, 'Welp. Looks like our boi Aladdin's the only option.' Anyway, I respond;\n\nMe: If you have, I don't remember, but yes?\n\nGG: Ok\n\nMe: Why do you ask?\n\nGG: Can you send a writing sample\n\nMe: \\*sends my sample\\*\n\nGG: Nice what movie do you want to do\n\nMe: I'd like to do Aladdin.\n\nGG: Oof I suck at Aladdin can you pick something else?\n\nOkay, listen. If you make a group for a fandom sometimes, you gotta accept some things are gonna happen. If you make a group for Miraculous Ladybug where OC X Canon is allowed, be prepared to play Adrien unless you outwardly state he's taken. And similarly, if you make a Disney group, you gotta expect someone to pick one of the most well-known and well-liked movies from the Disney Renaissance - especially when the main character's abs are on display and happens to be a charismatic thief. It's kinda inevitable, you know? Since Aladdin was what I came for and I'd already gotten the red flags and was getting pretty tired of this, I went silent. He spammed me a bit with, 'Hey' and 'Talk' for a bit, but it went quiet.\n\nTo see if my concerns were somewhat warranted, I had a peek in the group I'd been allowed to join. There was only one other topic, and I don't peek at other's topics  - unless I'm suspicious of the person I'm RPing with (how they write, if they respond back at all, etc.) The other RPer in there had sent over a whole bunch of Descendants OCs in one journal so they could start the damn RP already, as the bits before from GG was just nonsense. (He really, really likes Elsa. No problem with that, but I just noticed it's kind of a trend with this dude in particular.) Now, I want to let you know - I've seen GG's OCs and they're...less than impressive. Like, one of them was a modern day man with a war ship.\n\nIn the Avatar universe.\n\nThe Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. Yes, really.\n\nAnyway, he says 'none of them really appeal to me'. I would have been less bothered by this, if he hadn't questioned someone else why their character was short. Apparently he doesn't understand that pint-sized people exist, like moi. It really just seemed GG was just being judging of others' characters from the way they said it.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nA short while after this happens, I'm talking to one of my RP buddies, who I'll call Dia. Not real name, obviously.\n\nThey vent to me, about how they're angry because one of their friends got crap off a guy for dropping an RP she wasn't interested in. Initially, the name of the user didn't register in my head (cue dial up connection sound)...but you'll never see it coming - it was GG who had been a twat to Dia's friend!\n\nBut that wasn't what ended up being the last straw for me. No, no. \n\nIt continued on a different day. I happened to be browsing and decided to have a peek at GG's profile, that sort of 'hell with it' curiousity, you know?\n\nThey're not just being themselves - they're talking trash about one of my RP buddies, who I'll call Eir. Their words went, 'Don't RP with Eir they are a bad RPer and very stubborn' or something like that. **On their public activity that most Quotev users can see**.\n\nNow, I've RPed with Eir before - and not only are they good at it, but they're also super cool! I love discussing RP ideas and HCs and OCs with them. Now, we have a private group where we chat about the different fandoms we're in, and since we've not spoken in a few days, I ask if they're okay. They are, but they were unaware of GG talking trash. Anyway, they told me that they were fine, but that GG had been being a twat to her just for fun for too long, which was why he got blocked by Eir.\n\nTurns out I dodged quite the bullet in not RPing with GG, as apparently he had done things like killing her character or just making her characters more minor or just a love interest. Bleh.\n\nEir warns me to be careful around them, and I blocked GG, as they were one of my followers and they could potentially try that stuff with me...especially considering they may be stalking Eir on another account.\n\nNo thanks, buddy!\n\nHope you guys enjoyed reading - sorry if it's kinda long.",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrowaway account time! Yay! I've had an RP partner for 4-5 years now; we've written countless stories together, and for a long time, I was a lot of her moral support, or at least as much as I could be behind a screen. Now, she hardly talks to me :(  we'll call her Nina.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get it if it were IRL things going on, but it's not. Nina makes time to RP with other people and even has a guild - but will put in very little effort for me. For example, one of our oldest RPs is going through a lot right now - there's a major plotline coming to an end, but she rarely wants to RP these characters, or will put in any effort to contribute to the story. She's never told me she wasn't interested in the plot or anything, but I suspect she might be, which is fine - but Nina could at least try to steer it in a direction that she likes, or talk to me - or anything, really. We take turns coming up with little story arcs, but it seems like whenever my character has the spotlight for a moment, she loses interest. Which sucks, because hers get attention all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a hiatus off a game we also played (couldn't afford the pay to play), and I was gone for a while so it's fair that her characters were off doing other things. When I came back and tried to rejoin our plot, she said 'no', because her character would definitely leave his new love interest if mine came back, and she likes the new rp relationship too much. Keep in mind my character was set to kill the main baddie of the story, and now he's permanently 'missing' or dead, and can't come back. I'm not too beat up about it, but it was a little annoying, because now my character is in limbo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother time we had agreed on a scene for her character to be robbed by mine, who was an experienced thief; she godmodded and her character literally picked mine up and put her off to the side, said 'no', put on their armor and walked off all in one post, leaving me no room to act/reply. She hasn't ever done anything like that, we always /roll or RP fights fairly. Turns out, she was ditching to go RP with someone else. It hurts because these stories have been going on for years, and suddenly, I'm being ghosted, or at the very least cast off to the side as though she's known me for three days. She's trying to move right now, so I understand not having much time to reply, but that's only been the recent few weeks - this problem has been going on since last summerish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have other examples of her just- not wanting anything to do with me, I guess? But the character limit might run out. Does anyone have any similar stories to share?",

It's seriously been like four or five years, but I just started thinking about it and decided what the heck.\n\nI used too heavily be into group roleplay. Especially for Marvel and DC Comics.\n\nSince I only roleplayed on one site back then naturally anyone else who is into this stuff would run into me it's like these are the kind of forms I like so obviously I'm going to sign up for them.\n\nI even made a few of my own forums.\n\nWell back when I started making my own forums these two girls would join up a lot and we were pretty tight at first.\n\nUntil one day one of them just kind of stopped coming to my forums and because the other girl was kind of a follower to her she eventually started doing the same.\n\nWell what eventually broke the camel's back so to speak is when the more alpha girl told me that my forum was so much better made and she enjoyed it so much more than someone else's forum and she started lying to me and saying that she had been gone all day but I could literally see her posting all day on the other person's forum.\n\nI called her out on it and she didn't respond to me.\n\nSo I took it up with her friend in p.m. and I tried let her friend know that hey I was not trying to be mean, I just wanted an honest explanation.\n\nHer friend says to me that it felt like I was stalking them...\n\nAs in because I happen to enjoy the same kind of roleplay that they do and show up on the same forms that I'm stalking them.\n\nI mean if I was trying to figure out where they lived, what their real names were, their phone numbers anything like that I would understand that being considered stalker behavior but all I was doing was just joining forums for roleplay that I was interested in that they just also happened to be on.",
