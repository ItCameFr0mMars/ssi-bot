            "selftext": "(This post turned out incredibly long. If you would like to see the issue/topic in general without having to read all of it then please see the last few paragraphs. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not sure how to do a tl;dr for this.)\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nFirstly, I would like to say that I\u2019m not sure who is the \u201cBad RPer\u201d in this, or if there even is one. If there is, it\u2019s most likely me, though others have said otherwise. Secondly, I don\u2019t have any anger or hatred towards anyone involved. I still consider them friends and wish them the best. I\u2019m sure some of them might read this and I want to be clear this isn\u2019t a rant about YOU guys nor anything I haven\u2019t talked about before. Thirdly, this is more of a story about burnout and trying to fit where I didn\u2019t belong. It happens to most roleplayers and it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, sometimes you just don\u2019t mesh with a group, even if they\u2019re friends. Fourthly, apologies if this is super long!\n\n\nLet\u2019s get into it then. This is the story of how I completely quit rping and writing.\n\n\n**The Backstory:**\n\nI used to roleplay occasionally in forums a few years back, people might have known me as TheMargaret or a variation of that. I\u2019m not even sure if my accounts still exist and I know most of the forums don\u2019t. It was simple text-based rping set in a post-apocalyptic universe based around a very popular game and I didn\u2019t really take it too seriously. That was all fine and fun, my first real experience with rping. I took a few years off, distracted by work and life. That was until a new game came out, there was a lot of hype and I was joining many discords to find clans for the game. This is where I met this group and immediately I felt right at home. They had a text-based campaign that just started and I was hyped. My best friend joined as well and the roleplaying started, it was super fun! Some things were a little out of place for the universe, such as the introduction of \u201cmagical\u201d things, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal. It became clear that this wasn\u2019t just a simple post-apocalyptic campaign. Now, I\u2019ve never liked fantasy, anime, or media containing magic much. Just my personal taste and nothing against those that do. Rolling with it, I didn\u2019t see it as a big deal at the time, even if it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea.\n\n\nThis was my first mistake.\n\n\nEventually, it wasn\u2019t just the one campaign, the group had spidered out into several campaigns and created a connected universe. It was awesome and fun to keep track of! I ended up being the main GM in two of them (one of them being kind of forced on me, it was supposed to be a group effort but I ended up being the only real writer. It\u2019s okay, people get busy. I wasn\u2019t prepared but I did my best.) and started taking my writing more seriously. I\u2019ve always been the type to overplan and jump headfirst into a hobby and this was no exception. I spent hours and hours planning, writing, talking with players, and doing my best to keep everyone happy. It was difficult, considering the elements introduced into the story that I didn\u2019t know how to write around effectively (the magical shenanigans), but I really did try my best, though I didn\u2019t enjoy those aspects myself at all. Other people did, especially the main GM that started the original campaign, so I compromised and all was well. \n\n\n**The Incidents:**\n\n---- *The Crustacean:* Someone came into one of the connected campaigns and almost immediately started power-playing and generally was being very pushy in OOC. I tried to make it clear to people that I didn\u2019t want to be pinged needlessly on discord since I was involved in so much, it took a lot of time away from important things. This person would do it daily, spamming me with pings. Right off the bat, this player caused needless chaos and abused the rolling system we had to powerplay their character, causing a lot of other OG players to not want to participate in quests with them. As the GM, I did my best to try and keep this player busy since no one else wanted to do anything with them. Honestly, if I had the power at the time I would have banned them. But as it was, I was just a writer and not a mod. The mods were mostly absent (eventually I became the server owner, but it was far too late by then). I took time out of writing for the main quests and had to put other things on pause just to write quests and partner characters for this person. Still, even through all the distractions and time, they were relentless and still power-playing like crazy. Many people complained to the mods in the server but nothing was really done. It caused me to burn out for a month or so, I just didn\u2019t have the time nor the creativity to deal with it, much less the power to do anything about it. I was stuck and blamed myself for not being a good enough GM to handle a power-player. I almost quit right then, feeling defeated due to this player. At some point, this player joined the server that the original campaign was in, immediately did some BS power-playing, and tried to cause unneeded chaos. The main GM banned him there and that\u2019s what it took to get him banned in the server where I was GM. We killed his character IC and had many jokes about it afterwards (I even wrote a boss fight later on that was a play on his discord name, a type of crustacean, for laughs). I got my confidence back and started writing again, eventually finishing my writing for my campaign. I was so excited to get into the meat of it, we were close to the end and I was pumped to share the largest and most complicated thing I had ever written.\n\n\nThis was another mistake of mine.\n\n\n---- *The Dead Server:* The campaign that I was GMing was nearing the grand finale: full-out wars with custom battle systems, new enemies, foreshadowing events in the other connected campaigns set in the future, new bosses, new heroes, and big rewards for participants. I was stoked! I had always had confidence issues with my writing, feeling very inexperienced compared to the rest of the group, but I was genuinely proud of what I did. But then\u2026 the campaign died. It was hard to get players to participate. I don\u2019t blame them, not at all. With me taking a long break because of burnout and coming to the realization that maybe I had not done as good of a job as I thought I had, it was understandable. Plus, people have lives and the original campaign was poppin\u2019. I did what I thought best and ended the campaign prematurely, spending days rolling the battles myself and writing out conclusions. I didn\u2019t want people to leave without the end of the story, but I also didn\u2019t want to pressure them into feeling like they had to participate when they didn\u2019t want to or didn\u2019t have time. Ending the campaign all by lonesome, I was pretty upset, mostly at myself. But it all seemed fine with everyone else and the \u201cthank yous\u201d I got for taking on the role of GM meant so much.\n\n\nThere was a big issue with the mods of the server, most of them being inactive, one even left at one point, taking our very important rolling bot with them. But that got fixed and was fine by this point in the story. The other mods didn\u2019t participate in the campaign or even knew what was going on. Again, people have lives and that\u2019s okay. The active players and I all agreed we would take the next campaign to my server, where I paid attention to every campaign going on and was active daily. So we did so and it was all good. Sidenote: After I ended the campaign myself, THEN was when I was given server owner of the server with inactive mods. A little too late, but I was glad to have the server safe from deletion; I like having archives. We all moved on and the next campaign began. This time, I tried to make it clear that it would be beneficial to have everyone help write. There was no main quest and I was excited to have everyone collectively contributing as co-GMs. I ended up taking on most of the writing again, but others did contribute and it was fun. We even got to actually play out the rest of the campaign I finished by myself from the previous server! I felt SO happy and confident that the players were now willing to play what I had written and I honestly had so much fun. The last boss battle was my favorite moment in rping ever and it was a real bonding moment. But this ends that chapter, my last real good experience.\n\n\n---- *The Conflicts:* I would like to note that these events took place over several months and might not be in order, but they\u2019re all important to why I eventually quit.\n\n\nThe first conflict was when my best friend started backing out of the campaigns. He was my co-writer, favorite person to rp with, and generally my favorite person to be around in the entire world. It\u2019s because of him that I even got back into rping in the first place. He had some issues with the main GM, mostly because of the unfitting elements of his campaign and his tendency to power-play just a bit, at least in my friend\u2019s opinion. You see, I had always loved rping with the main GM, even if we didn\u2019t have the same kind of opinions on how the universe should be handled. But it was his campaign and I was invested in the story. There were times I felt out of place because I had more \u201ctraditional\u201d characters that didn\u2019t really fit, my friend felt the same but stronger so. Other people also complained to the main GM about the introduction of magical elements and his tendency to \u201cshow off\u201d his own characters at the detriment to ours. The first big thing that upset me was my character essentially getting downed (and eventually died from her wounds because of bad rolls) when I stepped away from my computer for a few minutes mid-combat to take care of my sick grandfather. But it was all talked out, as this group often did, and there was no real animosity. Except for my friend, he left before things could be smoothed over. He even warned me multiple times that this wasn\u2019t going to end well for me and my writing style, but I thought of the main GM as a friend and was enjoying myself. Mostly. After my friend left I suddenly had a very hard time making my characters fit in. I killed off a few or simply tried to retire them, making many others. Throw shit at the wall to see what stuck, so to say. Soon, I had a handful of characters all very involved. This plan backfired, now I was overwhelmed and STILL didn\u2019t feel like any of them fit. I feel if my friend stuck around then I could have had that anchor to help keep me focused and fitting in. But it is what it is, and I was thinking of quitting because I simply didn\u2019t know how to bring myself into the campaign and fit in properly. And I really missed having fun with mine and my friend\u2019s characters, he was really fun to rp with since we know each other so well.\n\n\nThe second conflict was another new player coming in. Now, I will say that they are one of the best writers I\u2019ve ever rped with. Very creative, very detail-focused, and I felt like both of us having a tendency to overplan made our character\u2019s stories together really blossom. At first, I was excited to have someone as invested as me! But soon, I started realizing yet again I didn\u2019t quite fit in. They had a tendency to introduce a lot of character drama, something that my characters weren\u2019t made for (most of mine are combat-oriented and militaristic since the campaign was in that style, at least it was at the time. I also prefer playing those kinds of characters.). I had one that was very, very sensitive. But it was supposed to be in a \u201cshe gets excited and motivated easily\u201d and \u201chas no filter for her potty mouth\u201d kind of way. But eventually, my character and her character were in a relationship. I thought this was a great opportunity to bring some more of my character\u2019s emotions out in a healthy way. But I was wrong, so very wrong. See, her character had a tendency to gaslight mine and emotionally abuse them. My character had no idea how to handle that, being a quiet victim of abuse herself before, and shut down. I always tried to be honest and human with my characters, so of course my character became depressed and honestly suicidal, as an emotionally sensitive human probably would in that situation. Eventually, I personally couldn\u2019t handle the drama and made plans to retire my character. But I agreed, after a lot of convincing, to not kill my character off so their character could still have a partner. I wrote a quest just for our two characters so they could bond and heal in a healthy way. I stopped playing the character as they would actually act and just started playing what kind of character their character needed for their own story. I had essentially lost one of my favorite characters, and definitely my most complex one. Eventually, this person left the campaign and started their own, another connected campaign in the universe, and all was well. Everyone seemed happy and they had a great story they got to tell freely. But I honestly was pretty sad, defeated, and again felt like I had failed to take control when I should have. I had lost several characters to this newly introduced drama, and other things. I decided to back out of the original campaign for a while and reassess my approach. Others were sad to see me go and told me, which meant so much, and eventually I came back to try again (we\u2019ll get to that towards the end).\n\n\n---- *Anger:* I like writing very dark things, it\u2019s just what gets my boat to float. I didn\u2019t join a post-apocalyptic campaign because I like writing about princesses in pretty dresses and tea parties. No offense to those that love fluff, I simply don\u2019t. In the games that these campaigns were based on are things like war, slavery, rape, murder, torture, sexism, and racism. Very, very controversial topics, but it\u2019s part of the world that everyone willingly joined in on. I wrote about all these things, partially because it was what I liked and it helped me deal with some of these issues myself, and partially because it was fitting for the universe. Other players weren\u2019t so happy with that at times, preferring to focus on the survival, characters just chilling in fluff quests, and the magical aspects. I did my best to write these things from time to time but it was very draining for me and\u2026 I hated it. But it\u2019s about the group and not me, I didn\u2019t want to be selfish. Slowly, I started pulling the darker aspects of my writing back as I wrote more. But the stuff I had already written still needed to be played out (this will be important later). A list of things said to me were (paraphrased, I don\u2019t have access to or know how to find the exact quotes, sorry):\n\n* You trapped my character in your shitty quest.\n\n* You\u2019re depressing (this was said nearly weekly).\n\n* I don\u2019t like your theme (the main theme of my campaign that depended on it), do something else.\n\n* I don\u2019t like the faction you wrote.\n\n* Your faction(s) is/are dorky/corny/dumb.\n\n* Write in something where our characters can rest, too much combat.\n\n* It\u2019s too militaristic, write more for the average character.\n\n* I don\u2019t want to read about that stuff.\n\n* Your posts are too long (most of the campaign was shortform).\n\n* Write something happy for once.\n\n* So many eye-rolling and hateful reactions to my posts.\n\n\nAnd so on in the same tone. I took all of these to heart and did my best to listen, but soon I was writing things that I mostly didn\u2019t enjoy. But everyone else seemed happier, I could take the hit to my own selfish pleasure for the sake of them having fun. Still, this hurt my self-confidence a lot. I mean a lot. I began questioning everything even remotely dark in my quests, even being scared to initiate combat without making it super easy so they could move through it quickly and have their characters not be too afraid. I eventually started writing backstories and filling in the blanks of time skips with my own characters to fill in that void of dark themes that was missing. I tried really hard to do it when people were asleep and keep it out of the way from everyone else, but I still upset some people when they read my posts. I realized that my flavor of content would never fit. This is when I stopped writing quests, relying on old ones that I had already finished. I was defeated and not having fun anymore, only doing things for other players and not for myself at all.\n\n\n---- *The Old and Last Quest That Never Was:* I had written a quest many, many months before it was actually time to play it. This was before the introduction of a lot of elements that I simply didn\u2019t know how to write around. I was nervous to do it when it came time, and asked quite a few times if I should skip over it. Players said I should do it so I went ahead. The day came when it was supposed to start, I was hesitant but willing. It began great, everyone was participating, even a player that hadn\u2019t really been around much made a new character just to come in! I started having fun again! This was a quest with many of the darker elements that I enjoyed, I had written it before any of the conflicts in the campaigns had happened. I had written freely with no worries. I felt so happy typing out my old words, seeing what really made me happy for the first time in a very long time. I suppose I had gotten lost in my own happiness selfishly when *it* happened. The main GM had a beef with one of the enemies, which is FINE and expected! I was looking forward to his character trying to come to a deal with the enemy. But the main GM must have thought that the absence of the magical elements was boring everyone? Or something like that? I wasn\u2019t sure, I still am uncertain of why he did what he did. His character suddenly became all powerful. I don\u2019t know what else to call it except power-playing, but he was the main GM and it was his campaign. I was only doing the quest as a guest GM. I tried so many things: talking down his character, ignoring the magical stuff since it didn\u2019t fit, and even bringing in a magical character of my own I only use during special occasions when things get out of control (I really hate doing that, but sometimes it unavoidable to keep the campaign flowing). Nothing worked, he was still doing his thing with his character and made it very clear that no matter what I did as guest GM that he was going to run the show (and kill off a main faction that I needed for the rest of the quest). I posted a reminder as the guest GM that this quest was written in the flavor of the original lore, trying to be nice and patient while also asking for a little understanding and compromise from him. He was having none of it and quickly posted that this was his campaign, he was now the acting GM, and his theme was the right one. I gave up, taking the hint that I should leave.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n**My Exodus**\n\nI handed over my notes and wished them all good luck, letting him take over again like he wanted. It hurt, it hurt a lot. And I was completely crushed. This was my \u201clast straw\u201d campaign, I was going to do it to see if I still had a place in the group. It was clear to me at that point that I didn\u2019t fit and the main GM didn\u2019t want my quest there, at least not like that. We were only a few hours into the quest too, this was only the introduction. I was, am, devastated. I spent that night going over all of the campaigns I was involved in and realized that I had made people upset in all of them at some point. And that I wasn\u2019t having fun anymore, I hadn\u2019t written something I really wanted to write in a long time. All of the quests that were of my flavor were ones I had written before the first big conflict. So I quit them all, cut myself off from ruining others\u2019 fun. It hurt to do and so many hours spent writing and planning were wasted. But I thought, think, it was for the betterment of everyone, except for me. This incident, the main GM power-playing to send me a message, wasn\u2019t the only thing that made me quit. But it was the cherry on top, the final hint that I should take my leave.\n\n\nNow this is where I\u2019m conflicted. After I left I had gotten DMs from almost every player asking me to come back, saying they enjoyed my quests, saying they would miss me, asking if I was okay. Well, everyone except the main GM, but that was expected. I simply gave him my notes and he asked me to stay. I was confused by that, since he essentially just ran me out of my own quest. The conversation was short and he stopped responding quickly. I had it in my head so hard that I was unwanted that I didn\u2019t know how to react, it was all so confusing. I did my best to leave quietly with no drama, I didn\u2019t shit-talk anyone, I lied and told them all I was fine, and kind of gave some robotic and \u201cpositive-view\u201d responses in hopes that they would all continue on without worry. But over the next few days the DMs continued, asking me to come back and asking me if I was okay. I kind of went quiet, logging out of discord for most of the day and left a few servers so hopefully they would stop worrying and just enjoy themselves (even while writing this I got another DM asking me to join back in and if I was okay). That\u2019s all I wanted, remove the bad egg from the carton so they could be happy. But I was so very unhappy myself. I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019ve been horribly depressed ever since. RPing was my favorite hobby, something I could do between work and a very stressful life. Between moving, selling my house, taking care of dying family, getting horribly sick myself, the death of my boss and friend, trying to work and finding new jobs, and generally always being exhausted from all of it\u2026 this was my escape. My one real happiness that I could look forward to daily. Not to mention that writing about certain darker topics and playing them out through a character helped me deal with a lot of my own similar trauma from my past. But now I don\u2019t have an outlet. It might seem so trivial, and I know it\u2019s just a hobby, but it really meant a lot to me. And now whatever confidence I had as a writer is gone. It sucks. It just sucks for me. But I really hope they\u2019re happy and have been told the campaign kept going, so that\u2019s something that makes me feel better about my decision.\n\n\nThank you if you read through all of this. Normally I would do a tl;dr for my posts but I feel like I needed to get it all out in detail. I\u2019m not sure how to feel about all of it, whether I did the right thing or if I was the odd man out. The way I feel, terribly defeated, completely conflicts with the feedback I\u2019m getting from the players as they reach out to me. What do you do when you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re the bad rper but others tell you you\u2019re not?",

A lonely girl that has two male friends from Slytherin (one she is in a relationship with), a friend from Griffyndor (which she is a Griffyndor too), and her brother who is/sometimes was in Azkaban.\n\n I went online to RP a bit and found someone who wanted to RP with me. We were doing well until this happens. She just types in chat :\" *she would text Rex to have her meet in the common room*\". I pushed it off and we kept going. Then she \"texts\" me again. I have no trouble helping people with roleplays so I have no hesitation to tell her what she did wrong. I said :\" (You can't text because in Harry Potter there can't be a use of electronics on school grounds because of the magic)\".  She just ignores it until later. She texts me again and I tell her that same information. Then she just says:\"(ok)\".  Later on I had to do something. This was at the point the RP was at its climax. Our characters were not friends and there was a plan against mine about to be done. I then typed :\"(AFK)\". And then I left. Now I RP with others and ironically someone asked to RP and I wanted to include them. I like people who know how to RP so nobody creates confusion. But when I came back she is still RPing. I tell her : \"(you can't RP with someone who is AFK )\". She then just says 'OK' and continues. Soon after that I had to leave. \n\nAlso, more of the stuff that made her entitled was during our RP she kept constantly asking where I was and saying my characters name. So I would always have to stop what I did and go to her and stuff. She also acted like she knew everything about me. (Which you can't do in a RP because that's how you learn about characters and stuff).      \n\nEdit - The friends that I play with are real and I friended them (not Harley though who is other Slytherin that is just a friend) just not my brother. And I have to more stories about others. One was about a Slytherin girl and she was being really commanding. She found others and for got about me and left. \n\nAnother one was a Ravenclaw girl. She was also very commanding. When we had classes she insisted that she was in mine. Which,  no I had DADA (Defense against dark Arts) and Slytherins have it with Gryffindors. We don't have any classes with Ravenclaw. So after that she said we should study in her common room. I can't get in there so we sat outside and studied. Then she did a transition in time which I don't like doing. After that we got on a full server and then shortly after she left.",
