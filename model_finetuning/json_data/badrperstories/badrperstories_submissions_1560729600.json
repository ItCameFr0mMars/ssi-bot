There is such a lack of motivation and well, interest for me makes it difficult to write, and only now do I realize/better emphasize better with all of my good friends/RP partners who preferred to fade to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I've always had issues with people, and one of them was/is the owner of a chat-based roleplay site that kind of filled the void for a lot of people between yahoo and f-list.  Whenever I told this person I was depressed/tired from work/just not in the mood, they called me a liar.  I've got this from a few other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what I get more is people who.... just don't care/make it about them.  I can't be tired, I can't be sick, I can't have work early in the morning.  They take it as a personal affront to them, despite telling them, countless times. I have issues with writing ERP, and recommended they find someone else to write it with them/I wouldn't get jealous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead, I get guilted, I get them constantly pestering me/making me feel bad about not finishing smut threads, despite telling them.  And while a lot of the times I could have blocked/avoided the site that person is on, which isn't really ethical, but when they're stressing me out to the point I don't go online at all just to avoid them, I feel it is an issue involving my mental health., and that goes above getting rocks off.  The problem is, this person is very close to me OOC, to the point that we're going to be rooming with each other for a week in less than a month.  But they get mad a me if I tell them I can't, or I'm tired, or I have to go to work early (given I work at 4am....), and they always take it as a slight against them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've given them my blessing to find other RP partners that are more consistent/less flaky.  I've also ased them, several times, if our friendship/relationship is based largely on RP, and they tell me it isn't, but stuff like this really makes me think.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Alex, and I typically rp in one-on-one scenes. Groups kind of intimidate me, but thats not what I want to talk about. I've been roleplaying for years, but most of that time was spent with the typical, boring, two-sentence turns from myself and my partners. Only recently, a few months back actually, did I actually take the plunge into detailed responses. It was purely by accident, but I discovered a love for writing that I never knew I possessed thanks to a partner whose writing style swept me off of my feet!\n\nI'm one of those bottom-feeders who posts in all kinds of subreddits looking for rp partners on Kik, most of the time for smut. I'll admit that much. At this point, rp was getting incredibly boring for me, and I was considering giving it up when I received a request from someone who expressed interest in one of my posts. I essentially shrugged, accepted the request, and got to talking to them about the plot. Note, this isn't a smutty scene. Its a classic fantasy-adventure and so on.  What can I say, I love typical tropes. We agreed on a starting location, and I asked them to start us off, as I was incredibly lazy back then.  Their starter immediately blew me away.  It was paragraphs long, but managed to keep my interest wholeheartedly as it described the interior of a common tavern, all the way from its creaky floor to its leaky roof. It went on about the howling winter wind outside, their character, and the mention of mine. Plenty to work off of. I was incredibly intimidated, as up to this point I'd never sent more than a single paragraph in rp before! I knew this was a golden opportunity to really delve into something fun, so I did my best to match the length of their turn and be as descriptive as I could be. It was shaky and read a bit weird, but I sent it regardless. \n\nFast forward to today, and we're still doing the same campaign, sharing the role of GM, and sending essays back and forth with no end in sight. Our characters are developing believably, have interesting backgrounds, and are just powerful enough to warrant being \"badass\" but not nearly powerful enough to take center-stage over the other. They are essentially considered above-average and nothing more. It is genuinely the best campaign I've ever been involved in, and it has definitely changed me as a \"writer\" permanently.  I find myself lovingly describing the colors of plants, the time of day, the bags beneath my character's eyes, and so on. All things I never even thought to do before this person came along. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately, I've been looking for a second partner to do another, similarly detailed campaign with. I found one, and they're pretty good, but their writing makes me... kind of cringe.  They write very well, talk about enough to keep the plot moving, use interesting vocabulary, and everything was going great at first. But then I noticed that they were starting to partially control characters I'd created within the world. It caught me off guard, but I figured that might be a normal thing to do. They were just background characters, so I definitely didn't mind sharing them. Keep in mind, I'm still relatively new to the ACTUAL roleplaying scene. Then things started to get really frustrating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd create a character with the sole intent of them behaving a certain way, even including these intentions in my turns by saying things such as \"so-and-so almost never speaks even when they should, no one knows why\". Obviously this is just a lame example, but my partner would do things in their following turn that directly counter-act these intentions by having that character talk, and not even about anything important. Things like this were a bit of a constant, but I pressed on. I started to notice other things that really bugged me, like how their turns almost never directly responded to mine, but rather read like a continuation of their previous turn. Or how their character was incredibly bland and was constantly bullied by a very boring character my partner had created whose sole purpose was to bully them. Before things even really start to kick off story-wise, their character is suddenly going through a huge, VERY important character arc that has them taking center stage entirely, and already doing things that go against their own morals for the worst of reasons. Even their writing says things like \"X does this very cool thing, and Y, Z, A, and B are all shocked that X is doing this very cool and difficult thing\". My character has essentially become a vessel for their character to show off. Any time I try to have any sort of character development with my character, or even mention their past or who they are, my partner immediately grabs the steering wheel and veers off into a whole other thing about how cool and unique their character is. We are still carrying on with this scene, and I pray it gets more bearable simply because I do enjoy their writing and the story around our characters. Its just all the unnecessary focus on their character is driving me nuts and making me seriously consider ending the rp all together. Inwardly, I'm hoping its just a one-time arc thing, but I seriously doubt my character will become nearly as important to our story as their character will be, simply because they keep writing things in to MAKE their character more important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I felt the first half of this post was needed was simply because I wanted to include my own experiences with something positive to counter the negative, and to give some background about my writing.  I know for certain that if it weren't for the first partner, I never would have seen the seemingly unending problems with the second. I find myself at an impasse, because while I cant stand the way they put their character on a pedestal, it is incredibly hard for me to find partners who use as much detail as I now enjoy in their turns. I'm not saying I DONT like less detail, but its always a breath of fresh air when you actually have to scroll to read everything the other person has typed, at least for me. I've decided that if things don't improve within the next couple of missions, I might pull the plug honestly. I would talk to them about it, but its hard for me to put something like \"Hey, your character is boring and doesn't deserve to be the star of the show, stop having an arc based around them so early on\" into words. I definitely will if things don't get better, but I'd really prefer to avoid the hurt feelings that come with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading, and I apologize if this reads like utter nonsense, I'm not used to posting on Reddit aside from partners ads on my alt! I could go on and on about what the second partner has done and said in our campaign that justifies this post further, but I figure that my post is plenty long enough.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! This is my first post on Reddit and I just wanna share my story. It happened a long, long, LONG time ago, so I will state anything my forgetful mind can recollect. Oh, and do note that this will be a very lengthy one due to me wanting to add any details and stuff my mind can remember (and will be a multi-part series) and the grammar might be a little off too. So yes... here comes the story.\n\n\nCast: \n\nStar: me\n\nMoon: bad rper and close friend of mine irl.\n\nFire: Moon's character. typical op edgelord with a harem\n\nViolin: my OC's daughter and was controlled by either me or Moon. has a crush on Fire\n\nSec: minor character from Moon. was only used for one thing. \n\n\n\nFive or six years ago (If I remember correctly), it was just a pretty boring night for me until Moon started introducing me to RP. I agreed to that since I was very very bored that time. He first showed me some anime-like pics since theyre gonna be used as faceclaims for a wife and a daughter, and lets me choose. \n\nThe starting plot by the way, is gonna have both of us have an already made family and are doing slice of life stuff... or so it seems... Do note this part, okay?\n\nAnyway, after choosing and creating my OC Star (which is basically a self-insert of me), and creating his, whom we will call Fire (who is also a self-insert). After that, we started RPing on Messenger. So far, it was going smoothly, doing slice of life stuff with a few action scenes added. \n\nAnd in those action scenes, I had observed that Fire was your typical edgy, godmodding character and even dubbed himself \"Harem King\" at one point. His character even had almost all the weapons in whatever fandom/universe he can get his hands on (ex: Yamato from Devil May Cry series, Excalibur from Fate series). Meanwhile, my character can only get his hands on a simple scythe and that's pretty much it, as far as I remember. \n\nI let it all slide, though, since I had no perception of what is overpowered, nor what is godmodding. \n\nAnyway, like I said earlier, everything was going smoothly until a scene came where Star's daughter, whom we will call Violin, had to tell me something. (Moon was controlling Violin btw though I would often control her) Of course, being the good listener my character was, I let Violin talk. \n\nViolin confesses that she has a crush on Fire. \n\nOkay... What...? I'm disturbed at this one, so I had my Star talk some sense into her about how... messed up it is. Of course, she complies... or so I think? \n\nAnywayyyy... Fast-forward to a year and almost a half!\n\nOur RP had lots progress and was going smoothly. Lots of plots were finished too! We both had already created so many characters and I had to turn Star into a cyborg to render him near-immortal due to the RP's time passage. Meanwhile, Moon's characters are basically immortal. Okay, sure... Also, he pointed out that my Star's wife is immortal too, and in turn, his children are also immortal. Excuse me but, wtf? \n\nAlso, I was at that point where I have enough understanding what is in a bad roleplayer due to my constant research on improving my RP skills, in which I also surmised that Moon was a bad RPer. Still, I let it slide. \n\nAnyway, Moon came up with a plot where the lord of Hell created an army and rose up to exact vengeance on... Fire. Uh...huh... Sounds a bit cliche but I accepted it. \n\nSo... our characters started to a part where our main place was destroyed and we had to search for some survivors. No one died, though. But then, Fire went alone deeper in the place, where he found Violin brainwashed and was ready to attack him (i was controlling her that time). Of course, he wins and reports her status to Star. Fire also wants to take Violin with him so she can recover, to which I accepted. BIG MISTAKE!\n\nAs soon as Fire took her to a safe place, Moon gave both a POV where Violin was resting and Fire suddenly transformed into a... girl. Yes, his character got genderswapped. The genderswap then proceeds to have \"her\" way forcefully on Violin. I was a bit angry since that wasnt supposed to happen but, like the usual, I let it slide since the show must go on. \n\nSo... after \"that\" horrendous scene, Fire reverted back to his male form and I had Violin realize that is was her \"Uncle Fire\" all along. \n\nNext scene, by the way, is about Violin meeting her long lost friend whom we will name Sec. Sec is Moon's character and is Fire's secretary. Also, Sec has a crush on Fire. ...Great... \n\nSo anyway, we had to play out a dialogue where they miss each other and had Fire treat them to a resaurant. It was at this point Moon was controlling Violin, by the way. And after the restaurant scene, the trio went back to the safe place and went to rest. Fire was in his own room meanwhile Sec and Violin had to share rooms. \n\nWhile in the bedroom, Sec had to tell Violin about her crush and... wants Violin to \"train\" her. Goddammit, Moon! \"The show must go on...\", I always keep telling myself while forcing myself to watch this. \n\nSo... after that \"training\", Moon had the two get out of their rooms (in lingerie, of all clothing available) and sneak into Fire's room, where the two saw Fire already fuccing another character, his own this time. When will this end...\n\nAnd after fuccing that girl, Sec and Violin went in and had one big threesome. Okay, but where is the army of the lord of Hell???\n\nSo... after that, Fire leaves the two exhausted and their POV is done. Finally! I sighed in relief after that.\n\nThe POV then shifted to Star and Fire fighting off an army. Finally! The plot is going back! Moon even had us fight off the army's generals, which made my mood back up after it went down from those horrific scenes earlier. \n\nMy Star and Fire then had a dialogue in which we will have to seperate ways to recruit some people to help us fend off the enemy army, to which the two did. \n\nThe POV then shifted to one of Fire's children, in which the character did a pretty good job in getting some men to fight for him. That scene went my mood up more since it was good progress. After that, I told him I needed a rest since it was night time, so we stopped. But in reality, I wanted some time to re-think about that previous scene while drifting myself to sleep... \n\n\n\n-Part 1 end-\n\n=To be continued=&gt;",

            "selftext": "I had people banning me because of false rumors, I did what it took to reveal people's faults, and finally actually got a real apology. I am on SL, as SamanthaPrater. I am on forums, as VivianaZariah, etc.  I used to be a very dark soul. I made a lot of enemies because of it. I am not proud of such. I was put on a drama website, harassed, and more, and it's because I trusted role-players way too easily.   \n\n\nI would show the images, but it's all-ready over. My lesson is something like this. TRUST is something I handle deeply. I under covered EVERY SINGLE RUMOR, LIE, etc, and I'm not going to sit here and let them half-assed tell rumors. My Feelings? MY Sex life? MY hard life? shouldn't be a topic online. it is. I WAS the bad rper in this story. I didn't let thing's go.   \n\n\nbut I could not let them tell me I was a monster for telling men NO, I didn't want to have sex. (Also known as ERP.) those men decided they would try to ruin me. MY lesson for you, overall, is even though I admit to being the Entitled/ Bad Roleplayer? they were even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey felt they were entitled to EVERY SINGLE INFORMATION ONLINE THEY COULD FIND OF ME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry for my past. I am sorry for the dirty rumors you may've heard, or read about me. I know now, that some of this are/is my fault. No more drama.  I left the game I used to play too avoid the mess. Communication is key, on how to actually handle things, and no one decided to do that. I FEEL a relief knowing I am NOT the entire problem.  I felt I needed to remove MY SELF from the problem to continue to do what I am doing, which is learning myself all over again after real-life abuse. hurt, and pain is not what I am about. I never have been. I WILL defend my respect. I WILL not let someone call me a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* . or other.   \n\n\nI have been online for more than enough time to share some light on this. I refuse to be the hated person, even if I have made mistakes, other's have made more. I was stalked, harassed, and fell into a dark spot. I looked up to some of these folks and I refuse to further this. a similar situation online happened around this time. I feel like I am the James in this. I ALL-WAYS shared my actual screenshots, in full, I SAID the truth. even though all I did was handle it wrong.   \n\n\nI am a Twenty Eight Year old member of the RP community. I actually DID get the legal action involved in this. I DON'T have to share it. I don't have to share if I am male or female. (female. I will share that in spite of my previous statement, I am a legal female. people actually claimed I was trans. I'm a husky woman. you can find my Instagram here.....----&gt;  [https://www.instagram.com/emiiartsy/](https://www.instagram.com/emiiartsy/)  . In my opinion, I'm no model. I am husky, I am buff, but no model. ) Communication is key. my personal issues became public, and I didn't want it. but I finally broke. I made sure people KNEW KNOWINGLY WHO was in the wrong. when I did? only a few had seen it, and they got a taste. I call that justice. we have ALL figured out who did what on many sites. I have only ever made the mistake of TRUSTING TOO EASILY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand not letting it go when it came up. people judge too harshly, but those Entitled / Bad roleplayers who felt they were entitled? They didn't know a lot about my past. My past is rough, I was hurt. I came out of it through people falling in love, so to speak with who I am.  I don't want people to think I'm not something. I refuse to be seen as someone who willingly starts drama, but as someone who Identifies as a pansexual? I love everyone. It's who I am.  \n\n\nI don't like it when people SHOVE their gay in front of my face, when it's not appropriate to do so. can you all blame me? LGTBQ , were a family. you may notice a similar statement in the other fight. THIS HAPPENED LEGIT TWICE. once with me, and once with James. James and I were BOTH slandered, and harassed. we are NOT the best people for our past. we deserve our future. We are people who make mistakes. I should've ignored the site when I heard about it. I am not a  bad person, I have mistakes.  I've come out of the \"closet\" and here, to admit  I made a LOT of mistakes, it's not, up to any of you to assume, who I am and who I am not. I took time to myself, the same way they did.   \n\n\nMy Ego was so big, yes. but that was because I had been hurt enough and I never wanted ANY drama. I didn't understand at the time, because I  had never had anything like that before. I was fat-shamed, I was body shamed. I took the time to handle my problems, I got a therapist, and their still not happy. I found out who it was, and yes, I don't regret sending that message.  MEN who treat women that way are despicable. I told him, no, and he said DO IT. I told him, no, then he got blocked.  \n\n\n Regarding the other drama.   \n\n\nI don't do it. okay? I DO Defend my person. I do refuse to be treated like trash. I refuse to harm myself. I refuse to go hurt myself in any way. I read about this, and I refuse to stoop to this level. I get, that by posting it, is bad. but in this case, sexual harassment is like rape online. I was harassed, asked to do things I didn't wanna do, but did because of pressure.   Due to other people online ALSO trying to control me, I was feeling alone.   \n\n\nNothing of mine will be lost. I refuse to it. I have only ever been honest, and I refuse to be treated like this again. I will be more careful.   \n\n\nMy Tumblr issue/ drama on that?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwas simply because of a person either being drama-filled, or hate on me because I was hating myself, and it led to her. I am sorry. but I'm not Toxic. I was constantly told to hide. to the point, no one knew who I was, or what I was capable of. I had to remove several accounts from Proboards, discord, and more. I refused to even participate in MY OWN AGE stuff because I was afraid others would get hurt. I refuse to be a Manipulative person. I'm not. But I WILL make sure Justice, is served to those who do deserve it. and by that? I Am NOT a  person who WILL serve UNNEEDED justice. I deleted it as soon as I got their apologies, after all, and we set off in different ways. I feel that doing that, makes them realize it's their fault, not mine. I feel they are very young at the mindset they are at. we have since disbanded as friends, and some have stayed with me to give me the chance to finally show who I am. I Got into a spot where, I REFUSE  to be seen as a monster. I said some things I was not proud of in anger. You'd be angry too, had you been betrayed after fourteen years.   \n\n\nI apologize for the lesser context, but those who know about this know more. I sent many emails trying to get the website in question to remove my personal content. they won't. I never got any defense, and I learned who my real friends were.   I WILL warn others about the site.   \n\n\n     The SITE is a drama site, I am not proud of how I handled it.I saw RED for being lied about. I refuse to do it. I wanted my name cleared so bad I even hid. I have a syndrome people out blasted about online, and it's embarassing. I was outted, and I didn't want that. My biggest fear had come true. I was bullied some-where, I thought I could be normal.  several have used my phone number to stalk me. I block now. HATE IS SOME-THING I REFUSE.  BOTH issues have framed me and lied about me, and yet I'm still apologizing for thing's. I got called fat, and fat shamed, and more. I have felt like suicide was the best idea all over again,and I refuse to do it. I am strong, I am me for a reason and I am making this vent/ entitled story to give you guys a warning. COMMUNICATION IS KEY. \n    \n    I DO have the  proof, and more on facebook that this is the case. those people felt they were entitled to my personal information and roleplaying was what led to it, I am some-one who is raw, down to earth and I'm not afraid to own my mistakes. I did make a lot, and i'm sorry. MANY of you don't know any of this because I didn't even know this site existed for a long time.  I don't make up things. I have been honest, it's not reality here, but I wanted to be real. I don't like liying.  The internet is .... a dangerous place for a young abused person. people thrive on hate, and anger. I know I wasn't the best person in the past, but I was young and made mistakes I 'm not proud of . I was Thirteen / Nine / Eighteen when I first joined these. I actually am an adult now. I'm not their scape goat. I have actual issues, and I'm not afraid to admit that. but I never said the issues where there, because I wanted to be treated like a snow flake. I REFUSE to let other's assume I'm saying other wise, I AM NOT crazy, NOR AM I SPECIAL.  I make mistakes. I said the wrong thing's, and I refuse to be treated in a bad way by role-players who I have helped countless of times. Entitled people need to understand that, that's rude. Online is online, for a reason. you never need to feel entitled to involve you're self in this. I was a kid when I first found my love for online, and I made a mistake in trusting too easily. I am a failure in the communication aspect of that. I was young. I'm sorry , but I'm not going to apologize for being young and dumb at the stupid. \n    \n    I was on good terms with several people. but now I'm on BETTER Terms with a lot . people didn't know why I was hiding or being the way I was. I never want people to hurt themselves, ever. I will state that I thought about it. the person kept calling me \"F*** twat\" and other things, and I refuse to it. this person  chose to harass me and more. I'm sorry this is so long, but this person both situations in fact? chose to fail to communicate with the one person who could conf irm or deny.\n    \n    \n    YES I SAID BAD THINGS. I don't mind people saying that I did that. I ACTUALLY ADMIT I DID SAY MEAN THINGS. but I REFUSE that people see me only as a monster. I am not. I want people to know that . I want people to know I only said the things I said because they were all-ready out there.Rumors hurt, but proof is there. I refuse to be a rumored about person, and i'm not hiding it. \n    \n    I made mistakes; I moved on. people need to realize I have been SCREAMING online , so to speak for A YEAR for them to remove themselves and move me out as well, of their lives. I REFUSE to think I am the one who needs to apologize, when I only ever role-played usually, and refused too believe other lies. Sex and such is none of people's busniess. that's my life. the entitled people will not be mentioned, you can find them in my name. Of course I'm going to be mad. I got harassed for a year over false rumors, and edits. and fake screen shots that only showed half the story. of COURSE I WAS MAD. it's fourteen years down the drain of my life. Who is the entitled person? me? I was a  little selfish but I kept people at arms lengths because I had a temper. I was angry at the world, and did not want to hurt. I kept  trying to be a friend. I didn't deserve some of them.   this is why I was never online. drama. I got into it too much, and people feel I decide to do it. people ACTUALLY need to realize my real life is my own. you need to know nothing but me being honest about product sales, etc, when I get my art going . I refuse to be seen as the problem. I only wanted friends. and I tried too hard, and I'm the one who's honest half the time. why am I NOT The victim again?  I'm sorry for my mistakes, but . who are you all to judge people ?  I want people to understand that you're Online life, should stay safe. only reason I gave people my name's is because I want people to see who I was, prior to who I am now. I want no secrets. \n    \n    I do have online account's that are no longer active. I did threaten at a point to have someone arrested because they never stopped. I got harassed, and doxxed when people tried I immediatly called my IP address. I made mistakes,  as a kid / teen / young adult, and I am now Twenty Eight and trying to move on. My message to the bad roleplayers, is that i've been you. don't do it. I tried every-thing to be loved. it's not worth it . I trusted the wrong people, and did my job on Society Online, and that'll be that. SP/ V . I am bringing this up again because I want people to see what I actually am like. I need people to know this, because I won't lose my self respect. I don't wanna be feeling like I HAVE TO DO SOME-THING, you shouldn't either. \n    \n    \n    \n    COMMUNICATION IS KEY.\n    \n    TOXIC PEOPLE CAN GO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/bMjK1F9s3GE](https://youtu.be/bMjK1F9s3GE)  &lt;-- please see this. this is a lot similar to my situation, and a great way to handle the drama.",

The Entitled people eventually wound up harassing me to get OUT of the community so badly, I had my IP address block the site! I'm not allowing myself on it any-more.  I highly recommend if you check it out? TRUST NO ONE TOO EASILY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did, and it got me cyber harassed. they doxxed me, and Linden LAB refuses to act on them. I was even suspended despite my many\"Tickets\" as they are called. I was created as a bad person.  Remember the saying.... \"Don't poke a lion with a stick , it'll only make it angrier? \" of course I'm going to get angry.    \n\n\n  \nYou kept at it.  \n\n\nI'm not sorry for being a jerk. You deserve it for telling me no. for denying someone to try and get included. you refused to include me. you refused too enjoy me. you refused to see me for me. I was harassed, and I'm Entitled? please note I've  apologized and countlessly, got told to leave.   \n\n\nit's not fair on you.or me. which group is Entitled? me or them?",

            "selftext": "So bear in mind this RP was supposed to be highly literate. It was fine for a while but then I noticed something annoying - my partner has that awful, janky, gritty style Stephen King uses and in my opinion, that's just terrible writing. This is from a group forum so not all of these posts are for me but for example:  \n\n*\"His voice was soft, kind, despite the rough language he let slip out. He was never been good at that, holding his tongue. It didn\u2019t matter if he was talking to a little girl or someone\u2019s grandma or the damned queen of England all he cared. Some silver-tongued assholes might have talked all pretty but their words were poison, shit was always shit. It didn\u2019t matter how beautifully you wrapped it and fed it to whoever was listening.\"*\n\nand\n\n*\"The way he lingered pissed (name) off. You\u2019re blocking my sunshine, you shit-filled cunt, he thought but didn\u2019t voice it this time. That would have been useless noise, nothing but a few feeble words that would roll off of the man\u2019s back like he was a damn goose. Words that didn\u2019t have oomph in them, angry words, the kind of words half-wits used when they racked their brain but nothing but static came through. \"*\n\nNow, I don't mind the profanities but otherwise, this kind of writing style feels jarring to me. Am I so out of touch? Is this what people categorize as literate and well-written nowadays? Because this person seems to be popular at the board, even with their.... Interesting style. It's all telling and not showing, I don't understand why he needs to write like that. And he's capitalizing on weird, useless things when he chooses to be overly descriptive. I can't take this anymore.\n\nThoughts? Prove me wrong, I want to be proved wrong.",
