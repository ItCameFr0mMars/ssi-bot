            "selftext": "Okay, so, for context I have this online friend that I used to do a 1x1 rp with based off of a fandom pairing we were into. It lasted for about 3 years and I ended it with them due to lost interest and...well, also because of them.\n\nWhile we were still running it, they would ask if I finished my post ALL. THE. TIME. Nearly every five minutes, no, every other minute in a seperate chat they would ask \"Now? Now? Now?\" It was. Infuriating. It also didn't help that I was dealing with a lotta stuff at the time during high school (thanks unknown depression!) and I was using this forum site to rp to destress. Them doing this constantly was not helping me much, especially since the more pressure I get, the less creative writing I can pump out. I'm also a biiit of a perfectionist and I was reeeeally shy and introverted during most of this happening.\n\nLong story short, I told them the lost interest reason, and didn't really bring up the constant asking as the main reason. Mostly bc I still valued them as a friend and since I didn't have many actual friends, I didn't want to lose them. Or have them be mad at me since I already got that enough from my parents. We broke it off relatively okay, and after that we kinda drifted apart as school really took up most of my time with college on the horizon.\n\nFlash forward to today, nearly 6 years or so later. I happened to join a group rp in the forum site that they were mod for, and we got to talking again. They brought up wanting to revisit the unfinished rp and start over, but I told them no. They would go on to re-ask in my interest to spark it again several other times over a semi monthly period, and each time I told them that I wasn't going to change my mind.\n\nWhat changed was when they brought up a commenter who got really pushy about us finishing the 1x1's story, since my friend decided to post it all as a full fanfic type of deal in a separate site (I was okay with it). We discussed how to deal with the commenter, ended up discussing loosely how we would've done the ending/a new story idea and... next thing I know, I'm back rping with them again. Apparently the ideas we had seemed to be enough to convince them that I was interested again, and admittedly, that was very much my fault. I did genuinely liked the ideas we formed, but I failed to mention that this wasn't going to make me go back to 1x1ing with them. \n\nNow I've trapped myself into this, accidentally leading them on about more ideas and drawings, and right now they're waiting on my next second post, still doing the same, constant bugging every second, this time (they don't say \"now\" anymore, but they've taken to poking me and more politely asking if they can expect a new post soon every day).\n\nIt's been...nearly 2 weeks, and logically I know that they technically have some right to ask since it HAS been a while for my turn (though for them they posted like. Immediately after my first intro post since they're extremely impatient) but my brain is just. Dead. I know what I should post next, but I'm not inspired enough to do it. Or, more likely...I actually don't care about it as much as I first thought. And I know it is my fault for not being forward enough bc I have a hard time saying no, but I don't want to be too aggressively assertive in case it might affect my standing in the separate group rp we're in since they're the rp mod n creator, and this 1x1 only just took off so now might be a really bad time to end it since we just discussed wanting to go farther than before in the story, and...I'm at a loss of how to handle this. \n\nI'd really like some advice to fix this horrible mess I've written myself into. Should I keep going hoping it'll be okay? Or tell them straight up that they are the main reason I've stopped rping and that I never wanted to do this 1x1 in the first place? \n\nWhat...should I do? Please, any help would be appreciated right now..",
