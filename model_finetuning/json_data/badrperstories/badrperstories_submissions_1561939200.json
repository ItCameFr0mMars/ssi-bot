It's getting annoying. -.- I get that people like their characters but enough is enough! This RPer randomly starts talking about plots their unimaginative character is part of, past events, their relationships, EVERYTHING.\n\nHow do we make it stop?? I know other people are annoyed with this too. This is not even a popular, well-made character. It's basically inside chatter with the same group of three or four people. And they're flooding our Discord channel with this so yeah. :)",

So, I decided to turn to my favorite pastime: Roleplay! So I decided to join a Fantasy School Amino (FSA for short, title has changed since) let's set up a few characters (apologies for the formatting, im on mobile, blah blah)\n\nOO: old owner\nNO: new owner\nM: me\nT: toxic person\nF: friend\nIce: nickname of one of my OCs\nPlant: nickname of my other OC\n\nOkay, so, the old owner wasn't the best. She would not deal with problems at all, no matter how many people reported things to her. NO was a curator at this time, the only curator who did anything. My character Ice was a frost giant who moved to the school from Jotunheim to learn more about human culture, and was currently going through some things, so due to F's suggestion, i retired the character for the time being and returned with Plant, who was a nature spirit who loved music. During this time, T moved into the dorms. Now T was a Cthulhu-like creature (a Mind Flayer from D&amp;D lore) and took an instant, sadistic liking to Plant. He would always try to get Plant to do sexual things with him, but Plant always denied him. Eventually, T resorted to sexually abusing Plant....even STABBING him at one point. I told both NO and OO, but OO was taking one of her infamous 'Hiatuses'. In other words, neither of them were going to do jack shit. Eventually, i told F who handled the situation and T left the amino to bother other people, and i retired Plant for good. He just gave me too much anxiety and bad memories.....I have PTSD and depression, so reliving sexual assault and abuse through a character of my creation going through the same thing really upset me. Eventually, i publically posted about this in the amino. And then all hell broke loose.\n\nIf you'd like a part two, I'll make one!",
