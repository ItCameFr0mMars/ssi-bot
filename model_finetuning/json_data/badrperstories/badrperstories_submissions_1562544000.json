            "selftext": "Okay, today I'm going to share a story about something in RPs that really triggers me.\nWe shall call the subject of this story \"phantom\".\n\nNow, on my RP website, I have meticulously structured almost every RP I have made into an intricately interwoven Universe.\nAlmost all the Lore and canon in my Universe is entirely original, with fandom elements and characters only being present in the background. I have a specific plan for what I want to do, and details that are yet to be revealed. \nA unique element of the lore in my Universe is that some players can contribute lore of their own that helps to shape my universe better.\nNow you can call me crazy for this next part, but I have this dream of my fictional Universe somehow \"making it big\", and becoming a wide scale Fandom. Because of that, I am a bit territorial and protective of it, trying to nurture the story as best as I can. But due to this, it is easy for me to become protective whenever I feel that my Universe or lore could be in jeopardy.\n\nAnyways, Phantom is a newer player of my RPs. He, unlike most other players, has a different style in RPs.\nI wouldn't call his writing \"good\", in fact it's the least good out of any other player I have. Phantom has committed many writing sins in my RPs, including:\n\n* Signing up 20 characters for an RP and only ending up playing 7 of them.\n\n* Constantly changing the plots of his characters in the middle of a plot that's already developing, and not making up his mind about what to do with his characters. Because of this wishy-washyness, most plotlines are just abandoned before they are fully developed.\n\nOne of Phantom's more annoying habits is that he aggressively inserts his characters into other players' characters' interactions. \n\nHowever, there is one thing above all that I can stand the least:\n\nPhantom has this nasty habit of interfering with, changing and hijacking an RP's lore and other characters' backstories to involve his own in an attempt make his characters more relevant. And of course this is nonconsensual. \n\nSo, you can see how this poses a big threat to my lore and story. Multiple times, Phantom has metagamed and played my characters without my permission in one way or another. One example would be when one of his characters were revealed to be a clone of one of my own, when there wasn't even any reason for him to do so.\nI have tried to explain how this is wrong to Phantom, but one way or another he always manages to circumvent my rules, no matter how specifically worded.\n\n\nSo I need your advice. What can I do to get Phantom to stop and back off from tampering with my canon?",

            "selftext": "Hi all. So I literally just left a very toxic DRoP site last week, that I was a member of for several years (we're talking 6+). It's one of the longest-running DRoP sites on JCink (it started on ProBoards before they did their updates). The original owner of the site was a great Admin; she ran it fairly, people didn't really have to worry about a lot of drama (any RP you're in is going to have drama, I haven't found one that doesn't have at least a little bit). People got things fairly, Impressions were generally very fair, and the super special snowflakes were cut to a minimum. Life was good, I loved the site, and as someone who was at the time new to DRoP, it was great to learn a new fandom and meet cool people.   \n\n\nThen original Admin/Owner got sick with a lot of health issues, left, came back for a little while a totally different person, eventually couldn't keep up any longer and passed site over to 2nd Admin. Second Admin was AFK forever, only showed up when it suited her for things, and here comes all the special sues and favoritism by some members. Moderators kept it pretty in-check, though, so it was nipped in the bud relatively quickly. Life was pretty good, still. Some Impressions happened out of spite because I called out Absentee Admin/Owner for basically never being around and not bothering to pass ownership off when she couldn't dedicate any time at all to the site period. Ended up getting a match for a dragon to a character who literally did not know what to do with that match. Had to figure out how to make it work, struggled with it, eventually transferred the pair out because another player started insinuating that he become 'eventual partners' with their then 9-year-old Wednesday Addams insert character (he was 24 at the time that happened....ew, no).  \n\n\nFast forward to current time. Most of old Mods are gone (they left when a handful of other long-time veterans left, and changes happened to the site they didn't agree with). Old Owner is gone. Most of old cast are gone, we're now full of adult children who are 25+ yrs old IRL, who act like they're 5, and who floodspam the Cbox with Kawaii-Desu emoticon bullshit and who get upset when you don't use it on everything you say (otherwise you're being 'snarky' and 'aggressive' - more of that later). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew Site Admin/Owner is one of the longer-term members,  who has been posted on the old LJ BadRoleplayersSuck because of her super sparkly sueisms. Dragonriding Lady Holder, Mental-Therapist Healer/Whiterider whose White is a terrible rendition of River Phoenix from Firefly. Super special attention-whore snowflake who has to be the spotlight character 100% of the time in anything she does, elsewise she doesn't want to play. Double-Wherhandler who is Blind, a Dolphineeer, a Betahandler, who singlehandedly stole a plot point she had no hand in creating, and took credit for the entire thing, despite the fact there are multiple threads with other characters being responsible and involved.   \n\n\nShe is never around, unless it has to do with all her own plots, or her own Hatchings, or her own characters being center-stage. Nobody else is allowed to have their plots; everyone else has to play second fiddle to her spotlight syndrome. She insists she wants more Hold RP on the site, promotes other people via contests for Lord/Lady Holders, and then proceeds to do things without their input at all, period. We're just supposed to go along with it; including removing the events that are primarily done for and by Holders - Gathers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe culmination of the bullshit was recently, which was why I quit. Staff on the site have been running an apocalypse of events in a chain that has literally been so overwhelming, multiple people (including myself, as at the time I ran a Lord Holder for one of the Holds, who literally had only been the Lord Holder for about half a year IC prior to the first event) have asked them to slow down. The majority of people on-site, who are actually active members, post about 2-3 times a week this time of year (summertime means vacations and increased work for a lot of them), had trouble keeping up with everything. In the span of less than 3 months OOC, there were the following:  \n\n\nSevere Drought, which lead to....\n\nWildfire (destroying crops at both holds both from fire as well as dumping sea water on them)  \nMassive Flooding due to to huge thunderstorms/bad weather that followed that\n\nMassive Snowstorm that followed that, which buried much of the outlying cotholds and required those Holders to move into the main Hold, putting further strain on the food supply.  \n\n\n***Mind you, after the wildfires, both Holds had to contact other Holds to ask them for aid. There hadn't even really been time to do a harvest, since most of this happened in the Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring, so there really wasn't a crop to harvest in order to pay back the other Holds.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggested that in the future, I'd like to do a Gather at my Holder's Hold to thank the Weyr for their aid. Abruptly received a message from Head Admin that lol, there was going to be a Gather at the Weyr in future weeks. Why you would host a Gather at a Weyr, when they're primarily financed and put on for a Hold, evaded me. But I sighed, shrugged (because really, what could I do at that point), and carried on. Mind you, bringing up the point that it would not make sense to have it soon, because see the bolded paragraph above. I figured Staff/Admins had it sorted.   \n\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, and suddenly there's a Gather at the Weyr. Along with a nifty thing on the sidebar, stating that it was 'financed by -my Hold-', and was 'a party, a Gather without end'. Because yes. After just experiencing ALL of that crap above, a Hold's coffers and fields would be able to support a massive party somewhere that didn't benefit them at all, whatsoever? I bring it up to one of the Staff - literally get the ASCII /shrug emote from them in Discord.   \n\n\nAnd I'm sitting here going 'okay, what gives, WHY is this so important'....  \n\n\nOnly for there to be A FUCKING EARTHQUAKE at the Weyr. Crushing most of the party-goers, requiring massive mustering from the Wings, Prides, and Hold Whers, which incidentally, means that Head Admin's characters are once more in the spotlight, and in charge. Despite the fact none of those characters are technically in positions of leadership where they are making demands/issuing orders to others. Amongst all this? And someone who's a recovering alcoholic, who manages to Impress a dragonet and that's cool, but someone with PTSD gets passed over in favor of just betweening the baby out of existence? And then you let the Hatchmom Impress one of her own eggs to her char? One of the special colors, at that? I know it's not technically against the rules or anything, but it's seriously bad form when the clutch is relatively small and not many of those colors exist to begin with, let alone that the character is 9 years old (and magically an Apprentice at her craft, when Apprenticeship was drilled on to everyone else member-wise to not even be permitted in the applications until age 10)? Oh, but wait - that character is the sibling of one of Head Admin's chars. That explains the Mary Sueism!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Fighter, one of the new colors (out of literally a fucking RAINBOW of colors on-site, really, when is enough enough already), decides that it's a great time to *lay a clutch of eggs*. A Fighter. In the middle of a fucking Earthquake rescue. Mind you - **none of this has been posted on the Flight sign up sheet.** So everyone who has gotten one of the much-desired slots to run a clutch? *Now has a reduced pool to work with, and potentially has to go and re-vamp their Impression listings and choices, potentially rewrite entire dragon babies, because one of the Staff decided their super-sue Fighter got to suddenly start hatching beeblets out.* No notification of at least *'plot hatching shenanigans'* to at least give immediate-future Hatchmoms a chance to be a bit more loose with their choices, no chance to let people know 'hey, Fighters used to be clutchers WAY back when, and we phased that out, but hey now it's back, so make sure you put that you don't want a Clutching female on your Impression Preferences, because now even Fighters pop out eggs!'.   \n\n\nCouple this with a requirement to use Icons on all IC threads, with us having to put a stupid icon on a character sheet thread, when it's specifically for Character Sheets in the Character Sheet forum, being called a 'call out post' against the Staff member who did it - all because I didn't 'word it appropriately' and it was 'snarky' and 'aggressive', and I was done. One of the members is constantly passive-aggressive in the Cbox, abusive towards other people, complains constantly about not getting tags back quickly enough (read: within the first 10 mins after they tag someone) but because they're '*on the spectrum*', their behaviour is excused. I word things bluntly without flowery terms of endearment or cutesy emoticons, and I'm being 'snarky' and 'aggressive'. You even have members with ranks on there who barely make the minimum posting requirements, and if they don't? You tell them to slap up a Hiatus thread so they can still make the reqs. One of your Weyrlingmasters was over 6 months late on lessons, to the tune of Staff having to fucking graduate them because they couldn't be bothered to post (too busy spamming characters on other sites), and you still didn't demote them. STILL. DIDN'T. DEMOTE. THEM. But I miss one lesson with my Wherlingmaster, and I'm getting told in messages on Discord, repeatedly, by multiple people, that I'm missing a post? Are you fucking serious right now?  \n\n\nI miss the old site a lot, but I just couldn't stay there anymore. Pro tip for Admins - if more than one member, I'm talking long-term, active member, tells you you're doing too much, too quickly? ***LISTEN TO THEM.*** Brushing them under the rug and focusing your attention on appeasing people who are *literally never around* isn't going to win you any favors. A lot of your members are ghosting now because almost all the active people left. I hate to see the site come to that, but enough was enough. I'm on a much better site now, with more canon color spreads and much less drama/hand-winging non-posters/adult children on board.   \n\n\nBut if you'd listened to your members more, maybe you could have been, too.",

            "selftext": "Today I am here to share a story with you, about three RP players who have been a nuisance throughout my GMing career. One is (too) good, one is Bad, and one is straight-up Ugly.  \n\nLet's start with The Good. Now, this isn't the good kind of good. This is the bad Good, where someone acts condescendingly towards others. When people think they are \"too good\" for something. So, I was running a superhero-themed RP. In the beginning, everything seemed to have run smoothly. I didn't really bat an eye at any of the other players. But, there was ONE player. He had been on the website long before I had, and I was new to the site at the time, with this superhero RP only being my second RP. This player and I have largely different tastes and styles in RPGs. He prefers Open-World RPs, in which the players can raise total anarchy in the GM's created world, without any overarching plot. He is also hyperfocused  on \"realism\" and \"logic\", getting triggered whenever there is  a timeskip, fast-travel, or quick-healing injuries(which is very silly, considering that most of the RPGs on this website are sci-fi and fantasy themed. Not much realism there, either). This player is also very passionate in his opinions, so needless to say he is very much an overzealous elitist, criticizing and condescending every player who does not play in his style. Meanwhile, I prefer narrative-based, story-driven RPs, in which all the characters participate in one singular plot.  So it is easy to see that our clashing tastes would inevitably lead to conflict. Towards the end of my RP, the player blatantly ignored and autododged my character's (granted autohit-y) attack. He, in his own words, proclaimed himself to be the \"catalyst\" who \"dared to defy the word of law that is the GM\". Seriously, you can't make this shit up.  What confused me was that up until then, the player mostly played along and was submissive to me. But only NOW, at the most inconvenient time, he decided to drop the ball and start criticizing me about everything I did as a GM. The thing is, why would you WAIT to give your criticisms if you wanted to better the RP? The player started telling me about everything I did wrong in an aggressive manner. Of course, his number one complaint was that my RP wasn't \"open enough\". So, in an effort to appease his picky ass, I decided to try to make the sequel to this RP in a more \"open\" format. So, come the sequel, I try to do things differently. I gave more freedom to all the players in the RP. However, I still wanted to have a GM plot, so I began attempting to find participants. Somehow, this RP incited MORE complaints than the last one! I also found that most of the players and characters alienated themselves from me, boycotting interactions with my characters. I realised that the one player from before had formed a coup with the other players to attempt to overthrow me as the GM. When I attempted to restore organized order within the RP, I was met with a more violent retaliation from the players. The one player was leading charge, and for a whole day my OOC chat was filled with backlash, agressive criticism, and unproductive arguments. It reached such a high toxicity that Mods had to step in to shut my RP down! All because of this one motherfucker. But it didn't end there. Even afterwards, this player constantly jabbed and criticized me, even in completely unrelated situations, to the point where it was borderline bullying.   \n\nOkay. Now let's talk about The Bad. In another RP if mine, I had received a player who was new to the website. This player was \"bad\" in the sense of being bad at a video game. He knew practically NOTHING about RPing. So I tried to teach him as much as I could, but I'm not sure if much of my lessons have stuck at this point. He, like a parrot, regurgitated what he aforementioned \"Good\" player had complained about with me. He also made a point about me \"not upholding my own rules\", saying was too soft. And often, this player made contradictory statements in different conversations with different people. He aggressively inserted his characters into other players' situations, even nonconsentually inserted the involvement of his characters into other players' characters' backstories. Needless to say, he is a hazard that must be contained and watched closely.  \n\nAnd now, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Ugly. I once had a player in one of my RPs. At first, everything seemed fine, though there were a few annoying things about him at that time. For example, he was online the most out of any other player. So, he wrote the most posts. Because of this, a few adverse side effects arose. For one thing, he and his characters were given more precedence in the RP than my own. His main hero and villain were held to the regard that my own were supposed to be, and I was overshadowed by him. Just because I couldn't be online 24/7 to write a novel if exposition every day. Another annoying thing was me having to read HUNDREDS of posts after waking up the next morning! And most of them are just filler and live scenes between the player's character and another player's character. So then my job is to filter out the actual important posts among all the filler. Anyways, this player was soon banned due to his toxic argumentative nature in the OOC chat. He was a control freak, and easily offended and stubborn,  not willing to take the advice of other players. This lead to his complete banning from the site. In the aftermath, he was invited to our player group's discord channel. But things were even worse there. He sweated excessively, and often made a lot of racist, sexist and homophobic remarks. So he was banned from there too.   Anyways, what do you all think of these stories? And do you have a Good, Bad and Ugly of your own?",

To this day I\u2019m not sure if I guilted myself into joining or she guilted me into joining.\n\n\n2. We were all supremely OP. I don\u2019t think we had a fight that lasted more than one round.

We are chasing an *active serial killer* and you decide you just want to plop us on a cruise ship with no structure? My character has things to do other than watch two other characters make out in a corner! Things like catching an active serial killer!\n\n\n4. We had exactly one mission that wasn\u2019t \u201cbarge in, fight something\u201d (I am choosing not to count the beach episode as a mission.) \n\n\n5. While that one mission was interesting (social engineering get-somewhere-you-shouldn\u2019t-be), the other players immediately decided to negate it next session by saying they needed my character to turn in the new mad scientist ally she made.\n\n\nSo I left. I\u2019d been having intermittent schedule issues already, so I had a good excuse. And yet, I feel guilty for it, like I let them down. What the hell is wrong with my brain, self?",

            "selftext": "Before we begin, I just want to start off by saying that there is no intended single \"Bad RPer\" in the following story. Everyone, including even me, was at fault. I acknowledge that I made some pretty retarded decisions and a few jumps in logic. It is more generally about a \"Bad RP\" rather than a Bad RP-er. I cannot pin the blame on any one person even if I tried, as a lot of this bullshit came from all angles.\n\nThat being said, I am sharing this story to Chronicle the epic Downward Spiral and crash of one of my RPs. This incident is nearly infamous on my website, and this RP is often used as an example of what not to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut before we can start this story, we first need to know the players(no pun intended):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Shadow:\\*\\* The original GM of this RP, retired before he even got one post out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Omega:\\*\\* Massive hypocrite, incredibly stubborn and persistent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-King:\\*\\* Arrogant Overzealous Elitst. The main source of rebellion against me in my RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Kira:\\*\\* Descriptive, large-vocabulary writer, but not good player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Coi:\\*\\* Owner of an OP ice-powered character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Monopoly Man:\\*\\* miscellaneous player, mentioned in passing in this story. However, he did not contribute much in the grand scheme. There were yet other players in this RP, but they weren't important enough to this story to be included.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-Brony and Hawkeye:\\*\\* Site Moderators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-The Sense of Right Alliance:\\*\\* The RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...anyways, I am having trouble finding where to start with this story. Because it has its roots in, well...the RP's very beginning. Maybe even before that. Let me explain so you can get a proper background.\n\n(Warning: this next part will be a bit long-winded. So if you think you can read and enjoy the story without context, feel free to skip down below to where it says the story begins)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe website this RP was on was not exclusively an RP site. It's mainly a fan site for an obscure fandom of a franchise that died 9 years ago, despite multiple attempts to revive it . Needless to say, this fandom hosts an incredibly small demographic nowadays, but this website still has a lot of activity. On this website, people can share excerpts of their original stories, share art, and just chat casually. And of course, a small portion is dedicated to RPGs. Most of the RPs here are centered around the aforementioned fandom, and Halo and Transformers. However, there are also a few originally-themed RPs, with an original setting and story. The content rating on this website is PG-13 at the most mature, so \"intense\" romance, language and gore is not allowed.\n\nI found the site about a few years ago. At that time, I had no idea about what an RP even was, though I had previously been interested in the concept of collaborative writing and interactive stories. So when I saw that RPs were pretty much the same, I was more than willing to give it a try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started off in the RP world quite unconventionally. Instead of just first playing in someone else's RP, I created one. That's right; me, a week-old user who still had their default profile pic, created an RP signup thread. Looking back, I realize that I would have had a greater chance of being struck by lighting on any other RP site. But I had a surprisingly good turnout, and we played the RP together. It turned\u00a0out really great, and I decided that I wanted to continue this type of thing after the RP ended, and that I would stick around for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I signed up for The Sense of Right Alliance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Real story begins now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Sense of Right Alliance was a superhero-themed RP, its concept and signup thread created by Shadow, the original GM.\n\nAt first, I didn't believe I would have as big of a role in the project as I ended up getting. I just thought that my villain character would be part of the villains team and get into some shenanigans, and my hero character would be part of the hero team and get into his own shenanigans. But Shadow promoted me to co-GM, and my villain character as leader of the villains, thanks to a word put in by Monopoly Man(who played in my previous RP). Then, I waited for the RP to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was getting sick of the waiting, as were pretty much every other player. All the players were asking where Shadow was, when he would be back and when the RP would finally start. But all these inquiries were met with no response. Eventually, it had been about a month of waiting, and it didn't seem like Shadow was coming back. I felt bad, and saw that almost every other player had wanted to play this RP as much as I did. So I made a bold but controversial decision: I decided to exercise my power as co-GM, and take executive action to start and host the RP myself.\u00a0\n\nMost players praised me for this and were grateful, while \\*some\\* others silently objected. Nonetheless, every player that signed up played in the RP when it started.\n\nAt that time, I easily overlooked most of the RP players. That is, except for \\*one\\*: a user by the name of King.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKing had been on the website long before I had, and so he considered himself to have \"been around the block.\" \n\nAlmost immediately from his first post, I could tell that something seemed...a bit off about him. In his first post on the OOC thread, King proceeded to greet me and the other players by picking apart my first post on the RP thread. He pointed out every Sperling and grammar mistake that I had made, and then went on to say that he didn't like the amount of times my character's name was used.\n\nNow, I am all for constructive criticism. I appreciate advice, because it can help me to improve. And a part of me did appreciate King's input. But there was also another part of me, one that was subconsciously offput by his demeanor. But I just shrugged it off, and told myself that I should wait before I could truly judge him.\n\nBoy, would I be wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RP progressed, and everyone largely played along and followed my plot. At this time, the RP was met with minimal complaints....\n\nExcept for one.\n\nEnter Coi, the owner of an autohitting OP Ice-powered character. At least, according to King. King complained that Coi's character was overpowered. But when confronted by King, Coi threw \\*me\\* under the bus, for apparantly being \"incompetent\" enough to allow it! So I was forced to intervene and nerf Coi's character's abilities.\n\nFor the rest of the RP, things proceeded normally, up until the final battle. The fight between the heroes and villains.\n\nIn the fight between my character and King, King blatantly ignored and autododged my character's (granted autohit-y) attack. When reflecting on this moment in the future, He, in his own words, proclaimed himself to have been the \"catalyst\" who \"dared to defy the word of law that is the GM\" in that moment. Seriously, you can't make this shit up. What confused me was that up until then, King had mostly played along with me and was overall submissive. But only NOW, at the most inconvenient time, he decided to drop the ball and start working against me.\n\nKing's character, as well as another character who was on the villain team, attempted to tamper with and sabotage my villain character's \"doomsday\" device, in an attempt to gain his resources. But the joke was on them, because it wasn't actually a doomsday device at all- It was a teleportation machine. My villain character then proceeded to teleport away from earth, leaving behind no trace of itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, as this final fight had been occurring, a new batch of players decided that they would want to join this RP towards its end, and so they signed up their characters. Among these late-coming players was a user named Omega. Since the RP was a bit too late for new players to join, I told them that their characters were accepted, but they would have to wait to join until the sequel. In fact it was an \\*order\\* that I had given them as the GM.\n\nBut Omega just ignored my ruling and proceeded to casually waltz into the RP. I was angered about this, but I decided not to say anything in fear of coming off as \"rude\". But now I had been given the unwanted task of holding Omega's hand as I guided him through the RP's city, while the final fight was simultaneously occurring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI soon ended the RP, with a vague teaser for the sequel in the final post.\n\nIn the OOC thread, King started criticizing me and pointed out everything I did wrong as a GM, from the beginning of the RP to it's very end. But the thing is, why would you WAIT to give your criticisms until the end if you wanted to better the RP? If you felt that something is wrong, why not point it out immediately instead of hiding your complaints and pretending to be fine with everything?! Of course, King had a number one complaint above all others: my RP had not been \"open enough\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, King and I have largely different tastes and styles in RPGs. He prefers Open-World RPs, in which the players can raise total anarchy in the GM's created world, without any overarching plot. He is also hyperfocused on \"realism\" and \"logic\", getting triggered whenever there is a timeskip, fast-travel, or injuries healing \"too quickly\"(which is very silly, considering that most of the RPGs on this website are sci-fi and fantasy themed. Not much realism there, either). This player is also very passionate in his opinions, so needless to say he very much acts like an elitist, criticizing and down-talking everyone who does not play or GM in his style.\n\nMeanwhile, I prefer narrative-based, story-driven RPs, in which all the characters participate in one singular plot. So it is easy to see that our clashing tastes would inevitably lead to conflict. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I made plans for the RP's sequel, creatively titled \"The Sense of Right Alliance: Volume 2\", King obviously had to object to this idea, like every other one of mine. He said that I had no right to start an RP that \"wasn't mine\", and that it \"belonged\" to Shadow(you know, the guy who suddenly disappeared and failed to start his own RP?). And while he may have been right to an extent, this was \\*my\\* RP now. Technically, Shadow's version of the RP was still dead, and never even started. I solely devised and structured the plot of this RP, not Shadow. So while our RPs may share the same title and theme, it was \\*my own\\* story now, and I could do whatever I wanted. \n\nI explained this to the other players, and also said that it wouldn't be fair to the new players who signed up at the end to not be allowed to play this RP. Everyone largely agreed, except of course for King, that is.\n\nAnd so, I started the 2nd RP in the Sense of Right Alliance series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, you are probably disappointed in the lack of downward spiralling. But trust me, things are about to go from tame to batshit crazy in a moment...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately from my very first post on the new RP thread, things began to go downhill. \n\nIn the first post, I explicitly stated that 3 months had passed since the events of the previous RP. I did this to give time for things to have blown over within the story and leave a calm break period between the nonstop action, and for the characters to get off to a refreshed start. But then, immediately afterward, someone responded with a post that began with \"3 Months Earlier\".\n\nSo now the whole purpose of giving room in my plot was defeated, and this RP was merely beginning right from the end of the last one. This really got me going, but I remained silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn an effort to be progressive and try to appease King's picky ass(I don't even know why I did this, he was literally the only person asking for this), I decided to try to make the sequel to this RP in a more \"open\" format. So, I gave more freedom to all the players in the RP. I allowed them to roam freely and create their own plots, and not have to be restricted to mine if they didn't want to be. However, I still wanted to have a main overarching plot, so this was where my \"Big Bad\" came in.\n\nHe was a semi-superhuman Plague Doctor-styled mercenary, a shadowy bioterrorist with an unknown past and vague, sketchy plans for the future. Sounds pretty mysterious and Badass, right? Well, this character would soon find himself degraded and picked apart by every other player of the RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings began well off enough. I had my villain character do some spooky things to get the players' and characters' attention in the RP, such as leaving branded corpses in the streets. I allowed my character to remain hidden for some time, but everything fell apart when he cane out of hiding and got involved in a fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should take a brief moment to explain what exactly my character's abilities are. Since he has no actual superpowers and couldn't actually go toe-to-toe with real super-powered beings, my character has to rely on his cunning and natural talents, aided by technology. \n\nThere is a greater emphasis on offense then defense, with my character wearing a cybernetic suit of armor. It is incredibly resilient, being resistant to extreme high and low temperatures, radiation and corrosion or rust. But above all, the most important detail for all of you to remember is that his suit is Bulletproof. Not bullet resistant, bullet \\*proof\\*. Meaning, he is completely immune to firearms, and no bullet can pierce his armor and harm him. And no gaps in this suit exist either. The armor is made of a fictional metal, meaning the limitations of real-world metals do not apply to it.\n\nNow, I mean it isn't too far-fetched for a character to have bulletproof armor in a superhero story. I see it all the time in movies and comics. Anyways, just keep all this in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, my character found himself in a confrontation with Omega's character, we'll call him Toby. Now, Toby has a really special power: he can summon and conjure weapons, namely firearms. So I thought this fight should be a piece of cake for my character, of not closely matched. Toby summoned a .600 Nitro Express. This gun is used for hunting Elephants, and were used in WWII to pierce steel barriers. But my character's armor is not made of steel. It is a bulletproof fictional metal that can withstand any firearm. So naturally, my character's move is to just stand there and allow the bullet to bounce off his armor. \n\nOmega lost his shit when I did this. He flipped out on the OOC thread, ranting about how \"BuLlEt PrOoF aRmOr IsN't ReAlIsTiC!\" And that it was too absurd ti be believable. And this is coming from a guy whose character pulled a gun out of his ass a minute ago. We were in an RP filled with Superheroes, Aliens, Paranormal Entities and Alternate Dimensions, but bulletproof armor wasn't believable?!\n\nWhen I asked Omega this, he said \"yes, yes it is.\" \n\nI tried to get him to see that my character required this armor to be able to get on the level of super-powered beings, and that if it were nerfed he would be too easy to kill. But he wouldn't budge.\n\nSo after arguing back and forth for about 30 minutes, I was forced to let my character get shot and wounded by the gun, and then die of fatal bleeding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wasn't going to give up that easily. I soon retconned his death, saying that the person who died was really a double of the real character. But when he too was bullied by the players into dying, I made it out that he was a double as well. And this went on and on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, I found that I had made a mistake in making this RP open-world. Most players excluded me from their interactions, and I was becoming more and more alienated from them. It was almost at a point where I felt like I was just writing a story on my own, with only about two other people willing to participate in my plot.\n\nAs I was left scratching my head about what was going on, the most unexpected thing happened:\n\nShadow came back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sent me a PM, and told me that he had been away due to \"personal issues\", though he didn't explain further. But the point was that he was back, and I was ecstatic. Maybe he could finally put in some good words about me to the players and make them all see that I wasn't that bad. And I was more than happy to give up my GM position, since it was becoming stressful for me. But Shadow said that maybe instead we would have equal authority over the RP, but I was fine with that too.\n\nI began telling Shadow all of the big plans that I had for the RP, but he simply just responded to me with an \"ehhhh...\", saying he would \"think about it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then...nothing again. \n\nShadow had been recapped on all the events he missed by the other players, including King who did an especially good job at insulting my plot, saying that it \"betrayed and insulted the atmosphere you had set up prior\" or some bullshit like that.\n\nAfter that, I saw no posts from Shadow, either in the RP or anybody the OOC threads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was back to square one, forced to independently run this RP. However, Shadow's brief appearance began to make all the players not treat me with as much loyalty and respect as they had before, that us even if they had before. Whenever I would do the tiniest thing in an RP's story, I would be bombarded by the players with statements like \"You should have asked Shadow first?\" Or \"I don't think Shadow would like you doing that.\"\n\nThey were all acting like Shadow was some sort of risen messiah just because he was only first one day after disappearing for half a year, before disappearing again. The had some delusion that Shadow would fix everything in the RP, and that it would only be a matter of time before he returned and I would be fired! I'm sorry, but did they \\*not\\* see the post where Shadow gave me equal authority over the RP as him, which was in the OOC chat for every player to see? And it wasn't like I could ask for permission to do anything anyways; he wouldn't have responded.\n\nSo I was obviously annoyed that all the players were worshipping Shadow while they disrespected me, when I put in all of the work into this RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then, a new twist arose. Coi sent me a PM containing screenshots. And the content of those screenshots had me absolutely livid.\n\nApparently, King had created a secondary PM for the RP that had every player in the RP except for me in it. And in the PM, everyone was talking shit about me, my characters and my story. And that's when I realized the truth about why most of the players had been avoiding my characters and plot: King had organized a coup with all the players to from a rebellion and attempt to overthrow me.\n\nEven Shadow, who before he disappeared, had written a post saying that he didn't like the plans I shared with him.\n\nThere were also talks of players attempting to get Shadow to \\*reboot\\* the RP behind my back and start from the ground up. Without me having any say in this. Luckily, Shadow had disappeared before he could take any action. \n\nEssentially, Coi was warning me that I had to act quickly to salvage this RP before it completely slipped from my fingers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this point, I was more than sick of the open world fornat that I never even wanted in the first place.\n\nI realized that in order to restore order to this RP, I would have to create one large scale plot that nobody could ignore and had no choice but to participate in(genius idea, I know).\n\nFirstly, I needed to explain away all the multiple doubles of my villain character getting killed. So I turned what was originally \\*one\\* villain character, into a literal cult of people who looked and acted just like him. And the true villain was the cult leader. This was an incredibly stupid concept, bit it was the best that I could come with. So basically what started as one powerful dude, had to be downgraded to an army of weaker expendable stormtrooper versions of himself. A plot I never wanted, all because of the players' bitching and moaning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I had a \\*\\*Genius\\*\\* idea for how I would get every player and character's attention.\n\nYou know how in The Amazing Spiderman movie, The Lizard uses attempts to use a machine to turn his reptilian formula into a cloud above New York city that turns everyone into lizards?\n\nI was going to do something similar, except with zombies. Yep, a zombie outbreak would be the grand climax. But the catch was, only superheroes were immune to the virus, the plot would be that they had to figure out why they were immune, while simultaneously finding a cure for the virus. It sounded (somewhat) great on paper, but when I put it into practice everyone hit the roof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey all started complaining that I was interrupting their \"stories\", which they let me have no part in and therefore I had no investment in, and they didn't have an actual impact on the RP's real story.\n\nOmega also threw some of his \"logic\" at me by saying \"ThAt'S nOt HoW cLoUdS wOrK!\", and he told me that wouldn't happen in real life. \n\nAfter being pushed around more, I was forced to restrict the zombie outbreak to \\*one tint\\* portion of the city, where nobody would be able to involve themselves, and the virus instead spreaded through the vents. How exciting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I attempt to top it all off with one exciting climax, not caring about any other characters' plots. I just wanted this hellish RP to end. \n\nSo, in the final battle the cult made the all the zombies fuse into one giant skyscraper-sized amalgamation that the only 2 people participating in my plot had to fight as the final boss.\n\nAnd one of these two players, was Kira.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKira was one of the players that had been in the batch who signed up at the end of the last RP. His character was a superhero from an alternate universe, a self-proclaimed \"archangel\" who wiped out the beings of his universe because they were too violent. Good backstory, cool character. Kira always wrote his posts to be very descriptive, and often used a lot of big words and poetic wording. This wasn't a problem, I thought he was a really great writer. In the OOC thread, he was one of the very few players to not insult or disrespect me.\n\nAnyways, Kira's character was in the final battle. \n\nHis character carries a spear as a weapon. Nothing special about it, just a plain old spear. So, when he was fighting the final boss, he hurled a the spear at it at a high velocity in an attempt to split it in half. \n\nAnd in the post where he did this, Kira wrote this really poetic and wordy post describing the attack. And the final word in the post was \"struck\". This is a blatant autohit, and The fight wasn't even half way done. And the monster's hyde is super thick, so even if the hit did land it wouldn't have even penetrated him. Kira acted like his good writing would mask the obviously unfair move. I wasn't going to let that fly.\n\nSo In the following post, I responded by saying that the monster stopped the attack by merely flicking the spear away with his hand before it hit him. \n\nSo do you know what Kira does in response? He throws a temper tantrum by rage quitting the RP, like any reasonable man would do in this situation. Kira's final words to me in the OOC thread was \"I hope your GMing skills improve on the future\". I'm sorry, but what the actual fuck? Was I in the wrong for upholding my own rules? And the move was stupid anyway. It would be like someone throwing a toothpick at me and thinking it would put a hole in my skull.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKira's quitting created a domino effect, and most players who were involved and invested in his plot left as well. But I was past caring at this point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI soon found myself met with a more violent retaliation from the players. King was leading charge, and for a whole day my OOC chat was filled with backlash and agressive criticism.\n\nAt this point, I wanted to eat a hat. I was the one who allowed them to play this RP in the first place. I constantly catered to their needs and attempted to please them as much as I could, and what did I get in return? More bitching, complaining and whining. I was done. I was sick of being an unappreciated doormat to all the players.\n\nSo, I finally snapped. I lashed out, and finally told everyone how I truly felt, and what I thought about all of them. All of my bottled up rage, irritation and frustration was finally released, and it felt \\*good\\* . But it didn't help matters, and the OOC chat reached such a high toxicity that Brony and Hawkeye, moderators on the website, finally stepped in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, \\*someone\\* had flagged the OOC thread and alerted them. After monitoring the situation, they reached an agreement:\n\nI and King were given warnings for our conduct, and let off with slaps on the wrist. That on it's own would have been embarrassing, but still bearable. What really upset me was what they did next. They \\*closed\\* the RP due to the \"real\" GM not being around. And right in the middle of the final fight. It really pissed me off and upset me, to see the thing that I devoted so much of my time and creative essence to, end up turning into something vile and being shut down, making it all for nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo this day, I still don't know who flagged the OOC thread. However my favorite theory/interpretation is that King had fone it in an attempt to take me down, bit it backfired and he himself also was given consequences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI learned a many important lessons from this. But among the biggest was that as a GM, you can't let your players walk all over you. You must establish your authority early on, and not be afraid to voice your opinion if you don't agree with something.\n\nI've been running RP's like that since, and things have worked out just fine for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to pin the blame on one person in this whole ordeal. We each all made mistakes and fucked up in our own way. Though I do feel that King had been a primary cause of most of the tension and stress, at least mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this has occurred, I am still extremely frustrated that even today, people still give credit to Shadow for the RP. Sure, he devised the concept, but any old person could make a superhero RP. And Shadow did Jack Shit to contribute to this. I carried this RP myself and did everything, so it frustrates me to no end that people still treat Shadow's word as Gospel, when there is no \"word\" to speak of. And I doubt I will ever get credit and appreciation anyways, especially after some of my dickish behavior during the RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you may be asking, \"what happened to all the players after this?\"\n\nWell...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKing, whenever he can find the chance, constantly bashes and talks down to me about what I did in this RP, even when the conversation had nothing to do with it. To say he's holding a grudge would be an understatement .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the most of the other players, my relationship with them is surprisingly quite strong today. They have still played in almost every other RP I made afterwards, and never again displayed the behaviors they had with me in this RP, despite me retaining almost the same habits and styles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Omega...\n\nWell, in an RP that I was hosting after this one, he played a large destructive space robot. When a character shot at the robot with their gun, this was what he responded with:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The\u00a0bullets would bounce off the robot's armor harmlessly.\"",

            "selftext": "Before we begin, I just want to start off by saying that there is no intended single \"Bad RPer\" in the following story. Everyone, including even me, was at fault. It is more generally about a \"Bad RP\" rather than a Bad RP-er. I cannot pin the blame on any one person even if I tried, as a lot of this bullshit came from all angles. That being said, I am sharing this story to Chronicle the epic Downward Spiral and crash of one of my RPs. This incident is nearly infamous on my website, and this RP is often used as an example of what not to do.   But before we can start this story, we first need to know the players(no pun intended):  \n\n\\*\\*-Shadow:\\*\\* The original GM of this RP, retired before he even got one post out.  \n\n\\*\\*-Omega:\\*\\* Massive hypocrite, incredibly stubborn and persistent. \n\n\\*\\*-King:\\*\\* Arrogant Overzealous Elitst. The main source of rebellion against me in my RP.  \n\n\\*\\*-Kira:\\*\\* Descriptive, large-vocabulary writer, but not good player.  \n\n\\*\\*-Coi:\\*\\* Owner of an OP ice-powered character.  \n\n\\*\\*-Monopoly Man:\\*\\* miscellaneous player, mentioned in passing in this story. However, he did not contribute much in the grand scheme. There were yet other players in this RP, but they weren't important enpuogh to this story to be included.  \n\n\\*\\*-Brony and Hawkeye:\\*\\* Site Moderators.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*-The Sense of Right Alliance:\\*\\*  the RP. \n\n...anyways, I am having trouble finding where to start with this story. Because it has its roots in, well...the RP's very beginning. Maybe even before that. Let me explain so you can get a proper background. The website this RP was on was not exclusively an RP site. It's mainly a fan site for an obscure fandom of a franchise that died 9 years ago, despite multiple attempts to revive it . Needless to say, this fandom hosts an incredibly small demographic nowadays, but this website still has a lot of activity. On this website, people can share excerpts of their original stories, share art, and just chat casually. And of course, a small portion is dedicated to RPGs. Most of the RPs here are centered around the aforementioned fandom, and Halo and Transformers. However, there are also a few originally-themed RPs, with an original setting and story. The content rating on this website is PG-13 at the most mature, so \"intense\" romance, language and gore is not allowed. I found the site about a few years ago. At that time, I had no idea about what an RP even was, though I had previously been interested in the concept of collaborative writing and interactive stories. So when I saw that RPs were pretty much the same, I was more than willing to give it a try. I started off in the RP world quite unconventionally. Instead of just first playing in someone else's RP, I created one. That's right; me, a week-old user who still had their default profile pic, created an RP signup thread. Looking back, I realize that I would have had a greater chance of being struck by lighting on any other RP site. But I had a surprisingly good turnout, and we played the RP together. It turned\u00a0out really great, and I decided that I wanted to continue this type of thing after the RP ended, and that I would stick around for more.  So, I signed up for The Sense of Right Alliance.   (Real story begins now)  The Sense of Right Alliance was a superhero-themed RP, its concept and signup thread created by Shadow, the original GM. At first, I didn't believe I would have as big of a role in the project as I ended up getting. I just thought that my villain character would be part of the villains team and get into some shenanigans, and my hero character would be part of the hero team and get into his own shenanigans. But Shadow promoted me to co-GM, and my villain character as leader of the villains, thanks to a word put in by Monopoly Man(who played in my previous RP). Then, I waited for the RP to start.  And waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited...  I was getting sick of the waiting, as were pretty much every other player. All the players were asking where Shadow was, when he would be back and when the RP would finally start. But all these inquiries were met with no response. Eventually, it had been about a month of waiting, and it didn't seem like Shadow was coming back. I felt bad, and saw that almost every other player had wanted to play this RP as much as I did. So I made a bold but controversial decision: I decided to exercise my power as co-GM, and take executive action to start and host the RP myself.\u00a0 Most players praised me for this and were grateful, while \\*some\\* others silently objected. Nonetheless, every player that signed up played in the RP when it started. At that time, I easily overlooked most of the RP players. That is, except for \\*one\\*: a user by the name of King.  King had been on the website long before I had, and so he considered himself to have \"been around the block.\"  Almost immediately from his first post, I could tell that something seemed...a bit off about him. In his first post on the OOC thread, King proceeded to greet me and the other players by picking apart my first post on the RP thread. He pointed out every Sperling and grammar mistake that I had made, and then went on to say that he didn't like the amount of times my character's name was used. Now, I am all for constructive criticism. I appreciate advice, because it can help me to improve. And a part of me did appreciate King's input. But there was also another part of me, one that was subconsciously offput by his demeanor. But I just shrugged it off, and told myself that I should wait before I could truly judge him. Boy, would I be wrong.  The RP progressed, and everyone largely played along and followed my plot. At this time, the RP was met with minimal complaints.... Except for one. Enter Coi, the owner of an autohitting OP Ice-powered character. At least, according to King. King complained that Coi's character was overpowered, but when confronted Coi threw \\*me\\* under the bus, for apparantly being \"incompetent\" enough to allow it! So I was forced to intervene and nerf Coi's character's abilities. For the rest of the RP, things proceeded normally, up until the final battle. The fight between the heroes and villains. In the fight between my character a d King, King blatantly ignored and autododged my character's (granted autohit-y) attack. When reflecting on this moment in the future He, in his own words, proclaimed himself to have been the \"catalyst\" who \"dared to defy the word of law that is the GM\" in that moment. Seriously, you can't make this shit up. What confused me was that up until then, the player had mostly played along with me and was overall submissive. But only NOW, at the most inconvenient time, he decided to drop the ball and start working against me. King's character, as we as another character who was on the villain team, attempted to tamper with and sabotage my villain character's \"doomsday\" device, on an attempt to gain his resources. But the joke was on them, because it wasn't actually a doomsday device at all- It was a teleportation machine. My villain character then proceeded to teleport away from earth, leaving behind no trace of itself.  Meanwhile, as this final fight had been occurring, a new batch of players decided that they would want to join this RP towards its end, and so they signed up their characters. Among these late-coming players was a user named Omega. Since the RP was a bit too late for new players to join, I told them that their characters were accepted, but they would have to wait to join until the sequel. In fact it was an \\*order\\* that I had given them as the GM. But Omega just ignored my ruling and proceeded to casually waltz into the RP. I was angered about this, but I decided not to say anything in fear of coming off as \"rude\". But now I had been given the unwanted task of hold Omega's hand as I guided him through the RP's city, while the final fight was simultaneously occurring.   I soon ended the RP, with a vague teaser for the sequel in the final post. In the OOC thread, King started criticizing me and pointed out everything I did wrong as a GM, from the beginning of the RP to it's very end. But the thing is, why would you WAIT to give your criticisms until the end if you wanted to better the RP? If you felt that something is wrong, why not point it out immediately instead of hiding your complaints and pretending to be fi e with everything?! Of course, King had a number one complaint above all others: my RP had not been \"open enough\".  You see, King and I have largely different tastes and styles in RPGs. He prefers Open-World RPs, in which the players can raise total anarchy in the GM's created world, without any overarching plot. He is also hyperfocused on \"realism\" and \"logic\", getting triggered whenever there is a timeskip, fast-travel, or injuries healing \"too quickly\"(which is very silly, considering that most of the RPGs on this website are sci-fi and fantasy themed. Not much realism there, either). This player is also very passionate in his opinions, so needless to say he very much acts like an elitist, criticizing and down-talking everyone who does not play or GM in his style. Meanwhile, I prefer narrative-based, story-driven RPs, in which all the characters participate in one singular plot. So it is easy to see that our clashing tastes would inevitably lead to conflict.   As I made plans for the RP's sequel, creatively titled \"The Sense of Right Alliance: Volume 2\", King obviously had to object to this idea, like every other one of mine. He said that I had no right to start an RP that \"wasn't mine\", and that it \"belonged\" to Shadow(you know, the guy who suddenly disappeared and failed to start his own RP?). And while he may have been right to an extent, this was \\*my\\* RP now. Technically, Shadow's version of the RP was still dead, and never even started. I solely devised and structured the plot of this RP, not Shadow. So while our RPs may share the same title and theme, it was \\*my own\\* story now, and I could do whatever I wanted.  I explained this to the other players, and also said that it wouldn't be fair to the new players who signed up at the end to not be allowed to play this RP. Everyone largely agreed, except of course for King, that is. And so, I started the 2nd RP in the Sense of Right Alliance series.  At this point, you are probably disappointed in the lack of downward spiralling. But trust me, things are about to go from tame to batshit crazy in a moment...  Immediately from my very first post on the new RP thread, things began to go downhill.  In the first post, I explicitly stated that 3 months had passed since the events of the previous RP. I did this to give time for things to have blown over within the story and leave a calm break period between the nonstop action, and for the characters to get off to a refreshed start. But then, immediately afterward, someone responded with a post that began with \"3 Months Earlier\". So now the whole purpose of giving room in my plot was defeated, and this RP was merely beginning right from the end of the last one. This really got me going, but I remained silent.  In an effort to be progressive and try to appease King's picky ass(I don't even know why I did this, he was literally the only person asking for this), I decided to try to make the sequel to this RP in a more \"open\" format. So, I gave more freedom to all the players in the RP. I allowed them to roam freely and create their own plots, and not have to be restricted to mine if they didn't want to be. However, I still wanted to have a main overarching plot, so this was where my \"Big Bad\" came in. He was a semi-superhuman Plague Doctor-styled mercenary, a shadowy bioterrorist with an unknown past and vague, sketchy plans for the future. Sounds pretty mysterious and Badass, right? Well, this character would soon find himself degraded and picked apart by every other player of the RP.  Things began well off enough. I had my villain character do some spooky things to get the players' and characters' attention in the RP, such as leaving branded corpses in the streets. I allowed my character to remain hidden for some time, but everything fell apart when he came out of hiding and got involved in a fight.  I should take a brief moment to explain what exactly my character's abilities are. Since he has no actual superpowers and couldn't actually go toe-to-toe with real super-powered beings, my character has to rely on his cunning and natural talents, aided by technology.  There is a greater emphasis on offense then defense, with my character wearing a cybernetic suit of armor. It is incredibly resilient, being resistant to extreme high and low temperatures, radiation and corrosion or rust. But above all, the most important detail for all of you to remember is that his suit is Bulletproof. Not bullet resistant, bullet \\*proof\\*. Meaning, he is completely immune to firearms, and no bullet can pierce his armor and harm him. And no gaps in this suit exist either. The armor is made of a fictional metal, meaning the limitations of real-world metals do not apply to it. Now, I mean it isn't too far-fetched for a character to have bulletproof armor in a superhero story. I see it all the time in movies and comics. Anyways, just keep all this in mind.  Eventually, my character found himself in a confrontation with Omega's character, we'll call him Toby. Now, Toby has a really special power: he can summon and conjure weapons, namely firearms. So I thought this fight should be a piece of cake for my character, of not closely matched. Toby summoned a .600 Nitro Express. This gun is used for hunting Elephants, and were used in WWII to pierce steel barriers. But my character's armor is not made of steel. It is a bulletproof fictional metal that can withstand any firearm. So naturally, my character's move is to just stand there and allow the bullet to bounce off his armor.  Omega lost his shit when I did this. He flipped out on the OOC thread, ranting about how \"BuLlEt PrOoF aRmOr IsN't ReAlIsTiC!\" And that it was too absurd ti be believable. And this is coming from a guy whose character pulled a gun out of his ass a minute ago. We were in an RP filled with Superheroes, Aliens, Paranormal Entities and Alternate Dimensions, but bulletproof armor wasn't believable?! When I asked Omega this, he said \"yes, yes it is.\"  I tried to get him to see that my character required this armor to be able to get on the level of super-powered beings, and that if it were nerfed he would be too easy to kill. But he wouldn't budge. So after arguing back and forth for about 30 minutes, I was forced to let my character get shot and wounded by the gun, and then die of fatal bleeding.   But I wasn't going to give up that easily. I soon retconned his death, saying that the person who died was really a double of the real character. But when he too was bullied by the players into dying, I made it out that he was a double as well. And this went on and on.  Meanwhile, I found that I had made a mistake in making this RP open-world. Most players excluded me from their interactions, and I was becoming more and more alienated from them. It was almost at a point where I felt like I was just writing a story on my own, with only about two other people willing to participate in my plot. As I was left scratching my head about what was going on, the most unexpected thing happened: Shadow came back.  He sent me a PM, and told me that he had been away due to \"personal issues\", though he didn't explain further. But the point was that he was back, and I was ecstatic. Maybe he could finally put in some good words about me to the players and make them all see that I wasn't that bad. And I was more than happy to give up my GM position, since it was becoming stressful for me. But Shadow said that maybe instead we would have equal authority over the RP, but I was fine with that too. I began telling Shadow all of the big plans that I had for the RP, but he simply just responded to me with an \"ehhhh...\", saying he would \"think about it\".  But then...nothing again.  Shadow had been recapped on all the events he missed by the other players, including King who did an especially good job at insulting my plot, saying that it \"betrayed and insulted the atmosphere you had set up prior\" or some bullshit like that. After that, I saw no posts from Shadow, either in the RP or anybody the OOC threads.  I was back to square one, forced to independently run this RP. However, Shadow's brief appearance began to make all the players not treat me with as much loyalty and respect as they had before, that us even if they had before. Whenever I would do the tiniest thing in an RP's story, I would be bombarded by the players with statements like \"You should have asked Shadow first?\" Or \"I don't think Shadow would like you doing that.\" They were all acting like Shadow was some sort of risen messiah just because he was online for one day after disappearing for half a year, before disappearing again. They had some delusion that Shadow would fix everything in the RP, and that it would only be a matter of time before he returned and I would be fired! I'm sorry, but did they \\*not\\* see the post where Shadow gave me equal authority over the RP as him, which was in the OOC chat for every player to see? And it wasn't like I could ask for permission to do anything anyways; he wouldn't have responded. So I was obviously annoyed that all the players were worshipping Shadow while they disrespected me, when I put in all of the work into this RP.  And then, a new twist arose. Coi sent me a PM containing screenshots. And the content of those screenshots had me absolutely livid. Apparently, King had created a secondary PM for the RP that had every player in the RP except for me in it. And in the PM, everyone was talking shit about me, my characters and my story. And that's when I realized the truth about why most of the players had been avoiding my characters and plot: King had organized a coup with all the players to from a rebellion and attempt to overthrow me. Even Shadow, who before he disappeared, had written a post saying that he didn't like the plans I shared with him. There were also talks of players attempting to get Shadow to \\*reboot\\* the RP behind my back and start from the ground up. Without me having any say in this. Luckily, Shadow had disappeared before he could take any action.  Essentially, Coi was warning me that I had to act quickly to salvage this RP before it completely slipped from my fingers.  By this point, I was more than sick of the open world fornat that I never even wanted in the first place. I realized that in order to restore order to this RP, I would have to create one large scale plot that nobody could ignore and had no choice but to participate in(genius idea, I know). Firstly, I needed to explain away all the multiple doubles of my villain character getting killed. So I turned what was originally \\*one\\* villain character, into a literal cult of people who looked and acted just like him. And the true villain was the cult leader. This was an incredibly stupid concept, bit it was the best that I could come with. So basically what started as one powerful dude, had to be downgraded to an army of weaker expendable stormtrooper versions of himself. A plot I never wanted, all because of the players' bitching and moaning.  Then, I had a \\*\\*Genius\\*\\* idea for how I would get every player and character's attention. You know how in The Amazing Spiderman movie, The Lizard uses attempts to use a machine to turn his reptilian formula into a cloud above New York city that turns everyone into lizards? I was going to do something similar, except with zombies. Yep, a zombie outbreak would be the grand climax. But the catch was, only superheroes were immune to the virus, the plot would be that they had to figure out why they were immune, while simultaneously finding a cure for the virus. It sounded (somewhat) great on paper, but when I put it into practice everyone hit the roof.  They all started complaining that I was interrupting their \"stories\", which they let me have no part in and therefore I had no investment in, and they didn't have an actual impact on the RP's real story. Omega also threw some of his \"logic\" at me by saying \"ThAt'S nOt HoW cLoUdS wOrK!\", and he told me that wouldn't happen in real life.  After being pushed around more, I was forced to restrict the zombie outbreak to \\*one tint\\* portion of the city, where nobody would be able to involve themselves, and the virus instead spreaded through the vents. How exciting.  So, I attempt to top it all off with one exciting climax, not caring about any other characters' plots. I just wanted this hellish RP to end.  So, in the final battle the cult made the all the zombies fuse into one giant skyscraper-sized amalgamation that the only 2 people participating in my plot had to fight as the final boss. And one of these two players, was Kira.  Kira was one of the players that had been in the batch who signed up at the end of the last RP. His character was a superhero from an alternate universe, a self-proclaimed \"archangel\" who wiped out the beings of his universe because they were too violent. Good backstory, cool character. Kira always wrote his posts to be very descriptive, and often used a lot of big words and poetic wording. This wasn't a problem, I thought he was a really great writer. In the OOC thread, he was one of the very few players to not insult or disrespect me. Anyways, Kira's character was in the final battle.  His character carries a spear as a weapon. Nothing special about it, just a plain old spear. So, when he was fighting the final boss, he hurled a the spear at it at a high velocity in an attempt to split it in half.  And in the post where he did this, Kira wrote this really poetic and wordy post describing the attack. And the final word in the post was \"struck\". This is a blatant autohit, and The fight wasn't even half way done. And the monster's hyde is super thick, so even if the hit did land it wouldn't have even penetrated him. Kira acted like his good writing would mask the obviously unfair move. I wasn't going to let that fly. So In the following post, I responded by saying that the monster stopped the attack by merely flicking the spear away with his hand before it hit him.  So do you know what Kira does in response? He throws a temper tantrum by rage quitting the RP, like any reasonable man would do in this situation. Kira's final words to me in the OOC thread was \"I hope your GMing skills improve on the future\". I'm sorry, but what the actual fuck? Was I in the wrong for upholding my own rules? And the move was stupid anyway. It would be like someone throwing a toothpick at me and thinking it would put a hole in my skull.  Kira's quitting created a domino effect, and most players who were involved and invested in his plot left as well. But I was past caring at this point.   I soon found myself met with a more violent retaliation from the players. King was leading charge, and for a whole day my OOC chat was filled with backlash and agressive criticism. At this point, I wanted to eat a hat. I was the one who allowed them to play this RP in the first place. I constantly catered to their needs and attempted to please them as much as I could, and what did I get in return? More bitching, complaining and whining. I was done. I was sick of being an unappreciated doormat to all the players. So, I finally snapped. I lashed out, and finally told everyone how I truly felt, and what I thought about all of them. All of my bottled up rage, irritation and frustration was finally released, and it felt \\*good\\* . But it didn't help matters, and the OOC chat reached such a high toxicity that Brony and Hawkeye, moderators on the website, finally stepped in.   Apparently, \\*someone\\* had flagged the OOC thread and alerted them. After monitoring the situation, they reached an agreement: I and King were given warnings for our conduct, and let off with slaps on the wrist. That on it's own would have been embarrassing, but still bearable. What really upset me was what they did next. They \\*closed\\* the RP due to the \"real\" GM not being around. And right in the middle of the final fight. It really pissed me off and upset me, to see the thing that I devoted so much of my time and creative essence to, end up turning into something vile and being shut down, making it all for nothing.  To this day, I still don't know who flagged the OOC thread. However my favorite theory/interpretation is that King had fone it in an attempt to take me down, bit it backfired and he himself also was given consequences.  I learned a many important lessons from this. But among the biggest was that as a GM, you can't let your players walk all over you. You must establish your authority early on, and not be afraid to voice your opinion if you don't agree with something. I've been running RP's like that since, and things have worked out just fine for me.  I don't think I'll ever be able to pin the blame on one person in this whole ordeal. We each all made mistakes and fucked up in our own way. Though I do feel that King had been a primary cause of most of the tension and stress, at least mine.  Since this has occurred, I am still extremely frustrated that even today, people still give credit to Shadow for the RP. Sure, he devised the concept, but any old person could make a superhero RP. And Shadow did Jack Shit to contribute to this. I carried this RP myself and did everything, so it frustrates me to no end that people still treat Shadow's word as Gospel, when there is no \"word\" to speak of. And I doubt I will ever get credit and appreciation anyways, especially after some of my dickish behavior during the RP.  Now you may be asking, \"what happened to all the players after this?\" Well...  King, whenever he can find the chance, constantly bashes and talks down to me about what I did in this RP, even when the conversation had nothing to do with it. To say he's holding a grudge would be an understatement .  As for the most of the other players, my relationship with them is surprisingly quite strong today. They have still played in almost every other RP I made afterwards, and never again displayed the behaviors they had with me in this RP, despite me retaining almost the same habits and styles.  And Omega... Well, in an RP that I was hosting after this one, he played a large destructive space robot. When a character shot at the robot with their gun, this was what he responded with:  \"The\u00a0bullets would bounce off the robot's armor harmlessly.\"",
