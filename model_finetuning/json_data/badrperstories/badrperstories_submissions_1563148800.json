            "selftext": "I attend an independant, little larp every month. It's nice. Honestly, it has spoiled me a bit because I can't go back to trpgs or 1x1 rp. There is something very different about making a character you then play for an entire weekend. This larp averages about 50-100 people per event  so you meet a lot of people very in love with their pcs. And most of the time it's interesting to see. However, there is one girl who attends this larp who I can't stand. \n\nWe'll call her Sarah. Sarah really loves her character. All she ever does is talk about how cool and powerful her character is. And, from a storytelling pov, her character is absolute dogshit. \"Lol random chaos!!1 xD\" is how we've come to describe her pc. She has her hand in every pie at this larp, participates in most factions and guilds, and yet contributes next to nothing to any of them. Farms new players to try and use them for her gains instead of trying to facilitate them having a good experience. \n\nAll she does is cry to staff until staff give her exactly what she wants, and it works every time. One time her pc proclaimed how she was going to kill all authority because lol random chaos. The rest of the town voiced their disdain and stopped trusting her. Sarah cried to staff about how she was being bullied by the playerbase until they finally let her be the sole savior of one event. The only one who could save the town. And yet Sarah has the AUDACITY to say she never gets anything. \n\nIn addition, she is trying to steal another players personal plot bad guy, the one he wrote as his character backstory and has been working for actual years to have his pc obtain this goal, because.... why not. She deserves it. Sarah thinks anything demon related is her personal plot and throws a hissyfit any time anyone does something with demons. (That would be like if i tried to claim the entirety of elves were my personal plot and nobody else could have them.) She REALLY wanted to be mentor to my friend. My friend denied that and said she wasn't comfortable with the rp. Sarah still insists her pc taught my friend's pc everything she knows. She whined her way into being squired by a knight and if her pc gets knighted soon I will be pissed. A new player had the opportunity to shoot his abusive dad, a diplomat, and plunge our war treaty into jeopardy. It was great roleplay, and his pc ended up exiled to the demon wastes as captain of a futile extermination mission. Sarah got mad because why can't she be captain, even though her character could easily participate. \n\nI help run a lot of rogue mods. I usually cater my portion of running the mod to new players, because new players can use an extra push to get involved. Many times if i need to build a team I have them open for people who have been at the larp for less than a year. Sarah wanted in on one of my missions; she's been at game for several years. I tell her this. Her response: \"BUT [her pc] IS NEW TO TOWN!\" \n\nOne time, between games, I tried explaining to her that you can't be a protagonist in larp and that you have to share the stage with other people. She didn't understand at all. \"If I'm not getting attention whats the point\".\n\nNobody I know at this larp likes her but none of us do anything about it. You probably think she's a teenager, right? Nope! She's older than a lot of the player base by a decade!",

            "selftext": "So to preface, both I and my RP partner are playing customized versions of a blank-slate player character in a sandbox RPG. They're the main characters of their story. And I'm okay with that! It in fact helps their amazing chemistry because they're coincidentally very alike and empathize with the other a whole lot.\n\nBut the other player is younger and likes the drama centered on their character, and their character, who we'll call Zack here, is extroverted and insecure, while mine, we'll call him Nate, is introverted and insecure. Zack, when my character steps on his toes, is very clear in stating that mine has dun goof'd and set off Zack's self-loathing. By contrast, I favor the school of strong, stoic suffering for my character's pain. If Nate hurts, he's going to do his best to hide it and assume it's his own fault it happened.\n\nThe problem starts to surface because Zack's insecurity begins to interact with Nate's own insecurity and his desire to not be a tick constantly sucking out Zack's resources. At this point, because of how the worlds work, Nate is literally attached to Zack's lifeforce in order to even exist and not get ejected out of Zack's world. He's dependent on Zack in a way that Zack and Zack's player, IC and OOC, know Nate is uncomfortable with. But Zack feels threatened every time Nate takes the lead or accidentally turns out better at something than Zack.\n\nAnd Nate's feeling increasingly like Zack's third-wheeling trophy wife. I've made sure that my narration involves Nate feeling awful to just sit there and let others care for him, physical cues that he's restless and fidgetty and to note that he does menial tasks as busywork. So ICly, it's clear something is afoot because when he's fine and bored, he meditates or writes.\n\nIf it was just Zack being oblivious, I'd be delighted! Because Nate is patient, but once he hits his limit he snaps and says what he really feels that he bottled up. And I would absolutely love for him to be pushed to use his words instead of picking at them painfully until he says something sanitized and inoffensive.\n\nBut Zack's player, OOC, is delighted to talk about Zack, and Zack's pain, and how Nate hurts Zack's self-confidence. But doesn't really react when I try to talk about Nate except in the context of reacting to something Zack does. Or at all about any time I express an interest that's outside of the game, even in a politely disinterested \"uh huh, that's nice\" way.\n\nAnd I'm getting tired of Nate being Zack's supporting cast, as much as I otherwise love how those two idiots step on eachother's feet, accidentally cause a disaster and then blunder into fixing what they broke while they fall in not-exactly-healthy love together.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: Characters do bad things. Consequences happen. Player thinks it is \"unfair\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis person in an rp I'm in has been getting on my nerves for a while and has come very close to getting kicked by the admins for how often they cause problems. They're 20 so it's really not because they're young and still learning.\n\nThe problem rper will just be called Person.\n\nT is me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblems with character 1:\n\nCharacter 1 and mine get into shenanigans. Character 1 misinterprets my character's actions and tries to kill her, thinking she is going to kill him first. My character tries to escape but Person is absolutely ridiculous and keeps retconning their character's mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can only be in one place at a time while rping. Person, in the middle of pinning my character, makes Character1 leave to go talk to their friends in another rp 2 miles away about what is happening in the rp I'm in. He is trying to rally other player characters to come attack mine. Obviously, since Player's character is now 2 miles away, my character makes a run for it. Person makes character1 immediately leave the other rp to rejoin mine and captures her again. I try to let it go but I'm just hardcore wtfing at what has happened. An admin steps in and says \"hey, you can't travel that quickly. you can retcon you leaving this rp or you can keep the leaving part in but you can't recapture T's character in time.\" Player is upset and says that it is unfair. Admin says that this is apart of the rules and asks again what Player wants to do. Player decided to keep the leaving part in and mine runs to the home area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rp follows a group of people in the apocalypse so there are no police to resolve the issue. My character warns them of what happened and the group waits for Character1 to return to figure out what to do. Character1 returns and argues their case. Fine, right? Nope. Character1 has a speech impediment which the leader of the group misinterprets as Character1 being dumb. For whatever reason in their long multiple paragraph speech, Character1's speech impediment completely disappears for no explained reason. It was super awkward to read for that reason. Because their isn't enough evidence of what went down, but there is evidence that both Player and my character weren't doing their jobs, we both get punished. Player immediately becomes pissed and complains that Character1 shouldn't be getting punished. Player says that my character should be given the death penalty for what happened. One person argues against them saying that their character was at fault too. Another person steps in and says that it was already explained that there wasn't enough evidence to even do so, and that their character was getting punished for not doing their job. Player quiets down for now.\n\n(Note about the speech thing: Those feelings about the speech are in-rp, the player of that character acknowledges how bad that thought process is.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this the other characters are understandably uncomfortable around mine and Player's because they are both considered untrustworthy. My character is afraid of Character1. Player was not okay with this reaction and would get upset every single time another character wouldn't want to be around their's. Mind you, no one was avoiding them outside of the rp, this was all in-character. But Player could just not accept this. Character1 loses friends who are now on my character's side. We would have rps where our characters were alone together and Player would ask if Character1 could join them. We would say okay, but warn them of what was going to happen. They would join anyways, and then when our characters would act afraid, player would lose their shit in chat and repeat that \"we need to get over it.\" They were taking our character's actions personally. An admin told them to stop so they took it into the rp. Character1 makes a giant speech that is extremely cringey, ooc, and again, their speech impediment is gone!! Another character yells at Character1 and tells them to leave my character alone, calling them out for their attempted murder. Player makes Character1 leave, join another rp, and attempts to rally other characters together to kill ours. Out of 5 characters they asked no one agreed to it because of how ridiculous the idea was to them in-rp. Player takes this response personally once again and types in all caps CAN YOU GUYS RP SERIOUSLY OMG. They were put in, and still are currently, in a two week time-out. The admins are super nice and patient but this is literally their last chance to fix their behavior so I doubt Player will last much longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already super long but guess what! The story doesn't end here! They have another character that they refuse to accept the consequences for.\n\nCharacter2:\n\nCharacter2 and Character1 have virtually identical personalities. They both do dumb things and get upset when consequences are given.\n\nCharacter2 has a trait where they like to steal medicine supplies to get high. They are open about it. The leader of the group found out and punished them for it because they were wasting medicine. Player predictably got angry and cried that it was unfair. Timeline wise this is before Character1 was even created so they were only gently talked to by an Admin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOOC Bonuses that annoyed me:\n\nAfter both of their characters were punished Player would bring it up constantly and sarcastically ask the player of the leader to not punish them for it. For example, if one of their characters dropped a cup and broke it they would say in OOC, \"Wow I sure hope Character1 doesn't get punished for this!\" The player eventually stopped giving a fuck and would just respond k which I'm sure infuriated Player based on how personally they kept taking everything.\n\nPlayer drew a picture that they would Not. Stop. Spamming. I looked back on this, thinking I might have just been overreacting, but they mentioned it over times in one hour. I don't know the actual number because I only searched what they named the picture. No one was acknowledging them past the first time and they seemed to think it was funny but it really wasn't. It was just annoying.\n\nLet's say the picture was of a funny cat. This is what the spam looked like: (I am directly quoting it btw)\n\nPlayer: Character1 rn lol \\*picture of funny cat\\*\n\n2 mins later\n\nPlayer: Funny cat is my soul \\*picture of funny cat\\*\n\n1 min later\n\nPlayer: Funny cat is my spirit animal \\*picture of funny cat\\*\n\nPlayer has changed their profile picture. (Take a guess on what they changed it to...)\n\nEventually (THANK GOD) they asked if they should change the profile picture because it was hard to rp with. 14 people said yes and no one said no. They finally took the hint and stopped bringing it up.",
