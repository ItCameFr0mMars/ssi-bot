            "selftext": "Hi everyone! This happened a long time ago and being someone who is actively involved in several D and D Campaigns. It's always kinda bothered me that I've never quite know how to deal with situations like this without it causing conflict. Basically I was really young at this point and I was  on a chat forum role-play with a supernatural (like with vampires and devils not the show) type of theme. One day this character came on and immediately the admin started to complain about how his characters never got to have any conflict. I was still pretty new but I empathized with his/her/their struggle. \n  I honestly tried my hardest to include them but every moment with their character was about how sad and difficult their lives were, and honestly it was pretty unpleasant. The main problem was any time the story wasn't about their character, they would make it about their character. The two main examples being that two characters in the story had a budding romance and we're having a tender moment. In the middle of which their character storms out, and they must have let one of their friends know because they came in and started in character shaming the other two characters and the admins. That basically called the admins out of character selfish as well. \n The second situation was what made this particular character leave the chatroom for good. The situation main was that we were at the moment surrounded by enemies and they choose this time to have their character have a full on panic attack. My character (thinking it was the best idea) tried to get their character out of the situation to safety before going back in to fight. As I was trying to discuss that with another player the admin basically had their character kill themselves, and exited the game after calling me selfish and rude. Then the icing on the cake is later on I hear through the grapevine from another Roleplayer that the admin had been trash talking me on his Tumblr and on the other pages. \nSorry for how long this is. It's just a moment that I genuinely wish I could have handled better, and was wondering if anyone had any pointers for situations like this. I never want anyone to feel like I'm purposely casting them aside and I tend to come across situations like this a lot.",

            "selftext": "It felt nice to vent about the other rper I encountered so here's some more stories from over the years. Every star of each story will be dubbed Player, their character will just be called Character with a capital. As far as I know, all of these roleplayers were very much adults.\n\nIgnore my bad grammar lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The hater of drama in and out of rp who still somehow enjoyed creating it\n\nThis is definitely one of the weirder roleplayers I've encountered.\n\nThis person was notorious for getting upset anytime conflict not involving their character happened in rp. Let's say two characters who weren't any of the Player's were getting into an argument. It was awkward but could easily be ignored, which is what a lot of people outside of the conflict were doing.\n\nBut Player? Nope. They'd get upset every single time something like this happened and make a big deal of it OOC. They'd say things like, \"Can you guys stop.\" and also, \"I think I'm just gonna make Character leave...\" People would always beg them to have their character stay but after I realized how often this would repeat I would just roll my eyes and ignore their attention-seeking. It was like they hated any kind of problems within the rp.\n\nExcept, well, they didn't hate *all* conflict in-rp. I remember one instance where a fight broke out and Player pulled their whole, \"I'm gonna leave\" spiel. The players involved in the fight let it die down and Player allowed their character to stay.\n\nAnd then, in a very few amount of posts later, *their* character started a fight. And they were completely okay with this and didn't bring up the fact that they had just asked someone else to not do that. This was the point where I started to completely ignore their reactions to us and encouraged other people privately to do the same.\n\n(Btw, the fights or arguments or whatever were very basic. It wasn't like they involved the topic of serious issues or anything that could be upsetting to anyone outside of the rp.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, on to non-rp drama problem. Any type of drama would cause Player to involve themselves. *Any kind.* Even the OOC,\n\n\"Hey I don't like where this rp is going can we end it?\" \n\n\"Can we try \\[this\\]? I can still see some potential.\"\n\n\"Nah man, I'm really not into it anymore. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Oh okay.\"\n\nWithout fail, you'd see Player posting in the vent forum about how they were sick of everyone fighting each other. It would leave a lot of people baffled because of how miniscule the \"drama\" usually was. Player also liked to start drama out of nothing. If there was a long time of nothing noteworthy happening they would post in the vent area and bring up how they were upset about something that had been resolved multiple times forever ago. Or they would make a rant post that was so vague it would get some people upset because they'd think there was something bad going on in the community. In reality, it was just Player being Player. The vent forum should have just been called \"Player's Soap Box.\" The rp died eventually so I never saw any comeuppance for Player's annoying actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. You guys are all problematic and non-educated. Also, my abusive character is NOT abusive you guys are just liars\n\nThis is the youngest Player in here. They were 18 when this happened.\n\nPlayer was very famous for making every RP about their character. Sneaking outside of the dorms? Uh oh, Character is having an asthma attack! A private conversation is about to happen? Character wants to join! Also don't make them leave or I will get angry in OOC!\n\nBlah blah. You've probably heard a lot about self-centered rpers so I'm not gonna focus on that. Just bringing it up because it was an important part of Player along with the even more annoying stuff.\n\nWhen Player first joined this rp they gave us their Tumblr. This will be important later.\n\nTheir character quickly became involved in a relationship with a female character that had a rough past. Player's character had a bad history too, so it seemed cute. However, it quickly became apparent that Player was playing an abusive character. There was nothing wrong with that. The problem was that Player was convinced their character was godsent and their character's lover, who will be called Girl, was the *real* abuser. When Girl began standing up to Character for their actions Player would label them abusive outside of rp. Because the spotlight was always on Character, whenever Girl would bring up her past Character would get pissed and tell them to get over it. Player would metaphorically pat Character on the back OOC. One time Character screamed at Girl and Player said she deserved it. Girl's offense? Being sad because her friend was dying.\n\nGirl's rper one day decided to make Girl break up with Character. People in OOC were cheering her on and saying stuff like, \"FINALLY!\" No one was insulting Player. They still lost it. They called us all idiots and wanted to know why we were cheering on an abuser. The chat went kind of quiet until someone who was new said, \"Um, Character is pretty abusive dude.\" Player began to lecture us on all the \"sins\" Girl had done and how she was bullying an abuse survivor. I pointed out that Girl was an abuse survivor too and Character wasn't acting right. Player told me, \"Shut up, whitey\" (??? They were white too) and a mod stepped in and muted them.\n\nThe chat was pretty awkward for a while as everyone tried to figure out what the hell had just happened. Someone asked if Player was a troll but they had been on the forum for ages and couldn't have been. Then someone was like, \"Uhhhh guys look at Player's tumblr.\"\n\nIt was filled with Player ranting about a lot of things. They were telling a very different story about what had happened and talking about how we were all uneducated and a danger to abuse surviviors. They also said that one of our players was racist for playing an asian character who talked a certain way. SHE WAS ASIAN! The character's speech pattern was based off of the player when she had first started speaking English. It wasn't a stereotypical accent, it was just mixing up some English words with others.\n\nI think the only reason Player posted all of this was because they forgot they had shared their tumblr. They had done it a year ago at this point in time so by this point not many of the rpers left were still following them.\n\nThey came back after some discussion with the mods and announced that they would be leaving. They said that first they wanted to make a post about their character going away. Alarm bells went off in my head and rightfully so, because Player rped out Character shooting themselves in the head. This was a school rp so the gun thing didn't even make sense. A mod banned them and cleared out what was written in the post. Eventually, someone else came in and fixed it to say, \"Character was expelled for being a fucknut.\" and all was well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Helicopter Player\n\nThis is a shorter story because I'm getting tired of typing lol.\n\nThis Player had an obsession with commenting on all and any rps. This took place on Discord. Player was well-known for reading every single rp that went on, which you knew because they would react to a lot of the posts. It was a little weird but not too bad. Then, the obsession started to show.\n\nAn rp had a character meeting another. One character was a little naive so she wasn't afraid of the stranger she was meeting. Player says in OOC, \"I don't think that's how someone would react realistically in this situation.\" They were not at all involved in the rp. One of the players said, \"??? Okay\" and ignored Player.\n\nThis would occasionally happen in OOC until Player, who I assume thought their \"advice\" was going unnoticed, started posting the comments *in* the rps. It was super annoying to have a good rp going and then out of no where a post would appear from Player, \"Yeah dogs can't do that.\" Enough people complained to where Player was spoken to. They said in their goodbye post in OOC that everyone needed to learn to take constructive criticism.",
