If you want to roleplay and people make effort to bring your original idea alive, do not waste their time. I love to write and I often use it as a way to escape my life during the day. I gave my time to a boring plot but I desired to see the possibilities in it, I spoke to a person from a rp page and went over what he desired I so much as gave backstory all for a simple and basic idea. He wanted a Train Ride roleplay..\n\nI wish I were kidding. I spent Two days talking to this guy, setting things up, and he wanted some sexy fun in the roleplay so I worked that in. I have never had many complaints or partners which throw hissy fits. But this guy was a major douche. I sent my post in and waited for a response over discord I thought perhaps he got busy. I checked on the guy after an hour later, and it  turns out after my post he flat out removed me and never gave reason or word what was wrong. If he did I were removed and couldn't see it.\n\nI didn't have much to go from, he wanted a train ride for the plot, I spent 2 days planning with this person...yet I'm guessing my post weren't ideal to him? If you see a guy looking for a train ride rp don't bother he will waste your time. It pisses me off because I believe in a set of rules. [Education, Family. Friends, Mental Health, Physical Health, Jobs, and your personal free time to do what you enjoy comes first.] Communication is key between a proper understanding, if people desire to post they will find the time to post and I sit waiting. I've been waiting for Four days now for a response in a story I am trying to develop, my new partner[s] have let me know of their lack of time.

Our writing styles click nicely, and we both have compelling characters. But there's one thing we're not compatible on and that's response times. My partner wants me to give 4-5 responses a day. I can only manage 2 responses on the days we roleplay. It's not that I'm overly busy, it's more like a perpetual state of writer's block. I've suffered from serious RP burnout and I've quit for a year before deciding to come back to it. It's hard for me to write in general. I love what we've created so far, from the world to the characters. I've talked to them about this before, promised that I was eventually get better, but I know they're being let down, and I hate that. \n\n\nHow can I get rid of this block?",

Because if he does smut then he's just another (his words) weirdo, creep. He seems to base this on past experience of seeing a lot of people only wanting to RP smut, if their partner was female.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's some other stuff, but it all boils down to....he likes to play submissive, feminine, small guys, and wants to have smut...but thinks that he's not allowed to enjoy such things, even though I personally won't mind doing any of that for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe in the past he met people who were judgemental towards him, and that shaped a lot of his current behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's a nice guy, and I mean genuinely nice.

            "selftext": "\nBefore getting into the why of this vent, I\u2019m going to backtrack to 2014~15, those were the years I first got into roleplaying. *(The NSFW part is the usage of profanity, yeah..it\u2019s one of THOSE vents..).*\n\nI roleplayed on a game called \u201cElsword\u201d, a 2.5D RPGMMO game. I met a person (let\u2019s call them O) on there. O was the first person who introduced me to rping. Long story short about our relationship is that we became \u201csisters\u201d (quotations because I found out that O was a guy the whole time..)\n\nOur roleplays on Elsword were based on the events that happened in the game. Later on O introduced me to another person, S, this S girl was actually in the same guild as me so with a already existing connection we got along very well. This is where the story begins..\n\nTo give you a TL;DR of our \u201croles\u201d, O was the decision maker of the group, decided what needed to be added, removed, and got the final say *if a rp continues or not.* S was making suggestions, and I...was the story-maker, worldbuilder- the one who leads the story. Me being the story-maker/lead, I would usually have to play the most characters (O: 3, S: 5, Me: +12). I find myself having to rp scenes by myself because some character interactions couldn\u2019t match with others. You might be wondering why was there such a character # gap between O and myself, to answer your question, O would dm characters I HAD to make to interact with his characters. (Ex would be making another guy/girl character to fall in love with their character.) AND THE FACT THAT O ALMOST ALWAYS CREATED MARY SUES. It\u2019s either the big booty Jane that gets all the guys, the tiny but overpowered feared loli, or taking on a high positioned/important role (Queen, Princess, Group Leader or the \u201c1000 year old legendary chosen warrior\u201d). \n\nNone of our roleplays would EVER finish. The reasons would be O\u2019s character(s) didn\u2019t get attention/interactions with other characters, I didn\u2019t make a character to fall in love with theirs, or some other petty reason. Because of this we always clashed heads. It wasn\u2019t fair that even though I took on the role of making stories, characters, leading the story interactions (so you would think I would have most of the say), O always had the last say, even though HE BARELY CONTRIBUTED IN THE STORYLINES. THE ONLY TIME THAT HE DID IS EITHER HE DEALS THE LAST BLOW TO THE BADDIES, 1v4 CHARACTERS AND WINNING, OR BEING THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DEFEAT THE BIG BAD. \n\nAs you figured out by now, S was always the one who would break up the fights and try to keep us together. S was the only person in our group that I truly saw as my sister. She would help me lead the story and add suggestions to the plot. But unfortunately there weren\u2019t times we could spend time with each other outside of rping because O would want us to spend time with HIM. He would keep us late until 3:00 A.M. ON WEEKDAYS. When S was getting tired and wanted to end the rp for the night he would say \u201cdunk your face in some water\u201d. \n\n\nSEVEN. FUCKING. ROLE-PLAYS.\n\nSEVEN RPS WERE RUINED BECAUSE OF THAT INSENSITIVE BASTARD! ALL THE TIME AND LOVE THAT WERE PUT INTO THOSE STORIES AND CHARACTER INTERACTIONS WERE *RUINED* BECAUSE ONE FUCKER DIDNT GET HIS CHARACTER IN THE BED WITH SOMEONE. \n\nSo I decided to end that toxic relationship for good, S didn\u2019t even try to convince me this time as she knew by now it was a lost cause between us. She cut his off as well. \n\nAfter that toxic relationship, S wanted to start rping again, this time between us. I actually wanted to quit rping because of the pain I went through from it but I decided to rp again...It was going great and It slowly began to restore back my love and passion for it again. \n\n*Unfortunately this story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending...*\n\nBack to now, S became Busy and couldn\u2019t rp like she did years ago. I decided to join other rp groups but they all ended shortly due to drama and inactivity. I tried to start my own rp server but now it\u2019s beginning to share the same fate of all my past rp groups...I\u2019m beginning to lose all of my motivation for rping now..if my own server rp doesn\u2019t work out then I\u2019ll delete and quit roleplaying...If only I didn\u2019t meet that Manipulative  liar...if only I could\u2019ve been exposed to genuinely good rp communities...I regret ever associating myself with roleplaying...it all ends the same...",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm mostly new to roleplay, I haven't wrote anything in about 8 years aside from one short lived rp attempt last year.\n\nOne of my buddies is very into rp though and is gonna do a horror rp with me, and I'm at the character creation stage. I wanna play an inhuman character. A monster that's (mostly) humanoid and has intelligence, but not fully human intelligence. There's something *off* about it.\n\nThe only problem is I don't know how I would write this character. Like how do I write its thoughts when it probably doesn't think in the way we do? Or write its actions before it meets my friend's character (since it will likely mostly be reacting to what she does, unless I figure out something else).\n\nHas anyone here played a monster before? How did that work in rp format? Any general advice would be appreciated too. Thanks!!",
