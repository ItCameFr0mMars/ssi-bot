            "selftext": "So currently I have two partners and their writing styles are vastly different from each other.\n\nSo partner 1 likes to describe her character to a point where it gets annoying. She can spend paragraphs after paragraphs talking about her character's blue eyes and a rich chocolate mane that covers her olive skin like a silk curtain enveloping the poet's stageplay.\n\nIt gets... Tedious. So, so tedious. And this person is PRAISED for her amazing and beautiful prose so of course, she crams this stuff into every single reply. And honestly, I think I'm the only one who's annoyed by her character's sapphire orbs glinting in the first moonlight like the baby fireflies, fluttering through the space looking for a purpose.\n\nThen to partner 2 and honestly, this is the writing style I prefer but this person gets so much crap for \"poor, boring writing\"\n\nI've never seen her describing her character's appearance unless it's absolutely needed. For example, she will mention her character is wearing a hood if they're trying to hide or that their hair is dishevelled if they're having a bad moment etc. But other than that, nothing really. But strangely enough, I do have a clear picture of how this character looks.\n\nSo overall, the style 1 seems to be preferred? Why is that? It's extremely obnoxious and so common it's actually less unique than the \"boring, bad writing\" -style.",

In fact, this type of bullying is rampant in this community and it's getting old. \n\nInstead of talking about their issues through like functional adults, roleplayers often resort anonymous complaining and public shaming in hopes the other party would somehow be able to read their mind or give up and just leave the community.\n\nI've seen people get smoked out in a very similar manner. Nice people, great writers. But for some reason, one or two writers have something against them. Maybe it's clashing personalities, maybe it's just good old jealousy. And when people start throwing rocks it can quickly get ugly and blow out of proportions. \n\nIt usually boils down to people projecting their own insecurities on the other person. People try to find reasons to get offended, they feel they're being personally attacked by innocent comments.  \n\nYesterday's thread someone was unfairly being called \"self-centred prick\" and a jerk who doesn't know anything about hardships others might go through. Just because they're extroverted and the person who started the thread was an introvert. They also proceeded to tell this person is a lousy writer and makes bad mary-sue characters, essentially letting everyone know they shouldn't write with them.",

A follower of mine who I've never spoken to contacts me, we'll call them Ty. \n\nThe message thread went as follows:\n\nTy: Hi\n\nMe: Hi...! \n\nTy: Rp?\n\nMe: What do you want to RP?\n\nTy: A smut idea I've had for a long time.\n\nNow, keep in mind that I don't RP smut. Not only smut, anyways. In stories, I do allow it, but only between two people who have developed a bond that warrants it, romantic stuff, you know? I state this firmly in my RP info.\n\nSo, I respond, now suspicious:\n\nMe: Sorry, I don't do Smut RP...\n\nAnd...what do they say? Do they leave me be knowing I'm not comfortable with this?\n\nOf course not.\n\nTy: Yea you do. I read your rp info.\n\n**Well, clearly not thoroughly enough, darling.**\n\nIt continues as follows:\n\nMe: Not just smut, though. I can do it in an RP, but not as the central focus. I prefer not to, anyway.\n\nTy: Please?\n\nMe: No. I don't want to and don't feel comfortable with it.\n\nTy: Then block me if you want. I do smut RP and ONLY smut rp. NOTHING ELSE. \n\nI, 100% done, respond as below:\n\nMe: Dude, just because we don't RP the same things doesn't mean we need to block.\n\nTy: Like I said, NOTHING ELSE.\n\nMe: Yes, I get it. You don't RP anything else, fine. You can block me if you feel like it then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey still haven't. And want to know what's delightful? Their most recent status update is...\n\n'Why are people so turned off by me? I WANT FUCKING ANSWERS.'\n\nHaha, you wonder why.

Fair enough, hijack attempts happen all the time. \n\nAnd then not long after he comes BACK! We try to ignore him and the heroes are trying to find their own ways to escape. And then this guys speech is what ticked me off. \n\n\u201c -_- Bruh I have a dimensional key to bring all of you to my dimension just let me do it.\u201d\n\nI was in an rp that was basically Who Can Plot Armour better because it was for fun but EXCUSE ME!? Just a quick tip, person. Just because you see people in an rp in danger doesn't mean they need help from ANYONE outside the rp. Do you not know how OOC works? Also, this guy talked in an attitude where he though we would all be wowed by his amazing strong abilities, instantly making him a well-written character right? No, it's the opposite. After we tell him to leave again, he also plays the victim card and calls us a bunch of jerks. \n\nNow, this doesn't seem very major, and it isn't, hence the flair. But the issue is Roblox RPs basically become unplayable because shit like this happens all the time. It's a godsend to have a nice, clean, uninterrupted RP.",

Or, at least, it was fantastic. \n\nThe thing is that they were gone for a month and I always get anxious because I get worried about the people on the other side.\n\nThey finally responded today saying that they were in the hospital and of course this makes my worry feel justified.\n\nI always ask if its okay to ask what happened since sometimes people like to just talk about stuff.\n\nThey respond with a lot of exclamation points saying that they just tried to die and...\n\nI didnt know what to say. I asked if they were being serious and they said yes and I was put on the verge of a panic attack.\n\nI've always been super anxious that someone would die before responding and I would never know and it just kind of freaks me out, I guess.\n\nI'm thinking about ending the chat with them just because Im kind of uncomfortable with how open they are about it, I guess?? And Im also worried that the seriousness of the rp wont help them, and also I dont want them to disappear again and just think that they actually died??\n\nI have no idea. I dont know what to do. I feel like if I end the chat, even with explanation, they will get more depressed and possibly try again? I dont know if thats irrational I'm just freaking put right now.",

            "selftext": "I don't care if someone recognizes the place or the person I'm referring to: I'm beyond pissed because this has been going on for months and it's never going to change.\n\nSo summarized: our discord server has this overly enthusiastic writer and they're constantly making people uncomfortable. I don't know what it is but it feels like this person needs to be the center of the attention all the time. They need to participate in every conversation and throw their own opinions and experiences everywhere. They're never content to just LISTEN. \n\nFor example:\n\nPerson A (very shy and reserved) shares a band that's very important to them and links their song.\n\nThe overly excitable jerk: Oooooh this is amazing! Reminds me of this another band I know! \\*proceeds to link the band and effectively hijacks the whole conversation\\*\n\nThis sort of thing happens ALL THE TIME. It's gotten to a point where people don't want to talk anymore because this one jerk is always there, always commenting and making it about them and stuff they like. \n\nIt would be okay if this didn't happen so often. I don't know if they're doing this on purpose but they do seem like a bully if I'm being completely honest. They have no idea how sensitive some people might be, how hard some people might have had it in life. Essentially they have no idea how to put themselves in other people's shoes. \n\nThey've been told numerous times to chill and be mindful of others. No change. \n\nWell, the only change has been that now they're always quiet and lurking BUT still jump in to hijack conversations if the opportunity arises.\n\nThey also don't care about trigger warnings at ALL. :) Yes, it's 3-3-3 rated Post-Apocalyptic board but still, have some common courtesy. \n\nThe reason why I give very little shits about someone recognizing this: it's a big board with loads of active members. If anyone happens to read this and they have been feeling disheartened by this idiot: don't worry, you're not alone. About 90% of our community hates them. :) We are currently in a process of gently trying to make them leave by simply not plotting with them. They won't change their behavior when told so maybe they will get bored when no one wants to write with them.",
