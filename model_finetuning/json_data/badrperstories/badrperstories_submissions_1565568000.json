            "selftext": "Warning: Pretty Long Rant Ahead. Be seated at all times. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01( I'm using emojis because I have to say what I have to say and I feel really nervous about explaining) \n\nSo me and my best friend have made some pretty bad RP mistakes in the past. When we first started out I was kinda a beginner but I've gotten better with my characters and plots, storylines. And we weren't flawless at first. We roleplayed back in March and it was fun. I enjoyed it, although I would say the amount of ridiculous power his main OC has ( let's call him Bryan that's not his real name) Kinda annoyed me. He was an Experiment and light being combined. But still, if he's half experiment or robotic then he should have been ripped to shreds by the actions of my villains. In fact he should've been dead. Thinking about it now, he was a glory seeker and made his characters the main ones. Wow, I didn't care about it then because I just enjoyed it. However i slowly realized my mistakes and his and on one day is when the bad roleplaying really began. Like REALLY. Even though he's been roleplaying for years. And I just started last year, and more this year. \n\n\nSo, here's how it started. Not interesting yet? Oh don't worry,  I'm just warming up. \n\n\nSo, back in May he wasn't feeling like roleplaying with me. So I just left him a message in case he wanted to. And he joined yet said he wasn't in the mood? I didn't even force him. I kindly left him a message if he WANTED To. I guess he wanted to after all....\n\n\nBut that's no excuse for what's to come my friends. So, the villains for this story line have just arrived in another dimension. Not even a minute into the dimension, keep in mind that this dimension is miles, miles, miles away from where his main OC Bryan is. And somehow, one of the side characters,  let's call her Carla, who is friends with Bryan... can f!*@&amp;&amp; sense them  from miles and miles and miles away!! HOW!!!? First of all, she contributed little or nothing to any of the storylines we've made. And that's the problem. First she's just an Experiment who is almost 30 years old, yet talks like an obnoxious 5 year old and sounds like it. \n\n\nAnd she has the power to sense villains,  even though it is literally IMPOSSIBLE, to do so when they are literally in another dimension. I don't care, someone that acts like a child in the body of a girl looking experiment shouldn't even have powers like that to begin with. And that's the thing, all his characters somehow have the magical ability to sense villains from miles and miles away!!!! They're all OP!!! And that's what bothers me. You can have one ridiculously OP character, but to have a whole arsenal is just..... NO.... \n\n\nIt takes both the fun and joy of having the hero get ready for the villain. Now that the hero knows that the villains are present and are plotting it isn't even a fair or good storyline anymore, because heroes have to be surprised and face challenges and make decisions. But now that they know, it's not even a challenge because they already know!!!!!! Not even ichigo or goku have this much plot armor!!! I think I owe them an apology........ how a human looking experiment that acts like a obnoxious 5 year old have more plot armor than those 2 combined is beyond me!!!\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31. At least goku and ichigo are likeable. But they are overpowered and have survived A LOT. But I'll admit they have redeeming qualities, because they're actually skilled in many ways!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere it's just a side character that does almost nothing and she's almost no different from Bryan at all. Carla is almost alike to Bryan, both have this ridiculous ability to sense threats coming from another dimension miles beyond weeks of travelling. Both can't be destroyed no matter what!!! No matter what!!!! How!!! Holy $^#&amp;#&amp;. And what's makes It worse after she senses them she runs away like a coward towards Bryan. How is she this OP, yet afraid of them? How!!!? Okay, okay let's focus on why she can somehow sense villains from miles and miles away. \n\n\n\nWanna know my best friends reasoning of why she sensed them.  I asked him how? Not even lying heres what he said in return: \n\n\nAnswer: \" ( Carla thinks heard a lil before she ran and basically said she thinks some evil dude wants to take over the mainframe )\n\n\n\nOkay. Okay, yes the setting is a mainframe but still, there's no fu#$ing way she can have that ability. I don't care, it's not possible and even roleplays have to have logic!!! \n\n\n\nNEXT BIG FLAW!! So all of his characters seem like copies of each other. All ridiculously OP. No matter how useless they are.. They have that \" I CAN'T DIE BECAUSE I'M THE CHEERLEADER OF THE MAIN CHARACTER AND I HAVE TO BE ALIVE TO SUPPORT HIM\" Syndrome. \n\n\nBut here's what makes things worse. Somehow, not even a minute let alone 10, some of Bryans friends just so happen to have snuck onto the dimension they are in which is one impossible. And they disguise themselves as villains.  First of all my viallins aren't gullible yet he makes them look gullible even though my villains know each and every one of their members and dont invite outsiders because they want no one to find out. \n\n\nHe says all experiments are Hyper- dimension jumper though. Look I know it seems like I'm being a jerk, but it ruins the fun of a great adventure. All of his characters have the same ability. Same OP status. And what's worse he just states this. This was never mentioned or even told before. It ruins it because then they can just go to that dimension and just beat them up. Theres no build up, no actual danger for anyone becuae they're all the same. Carla doesn't have this ability however yet somehow can sense them from another dimension. \n\n\n\nAnd I don't want my villains to know they infiltrated because if they do then it'll be too early for them to know and trust me, If I do make my villains know that Bryans friends are with them... then my best friend would question me... even though my villains logically know who's a traitor and not. \n\n\nOkay, okay. OP Rolepayers likely best friend usually come off as annoying. I know my friend means well but still, when I tried to question him again about these plot holes he just ignored me again and again. And seems to get ticked off even though he has to know that it doesn't make sense. I don't dislike my best friend, it's just his OCs. All almost identical to each other with ridiculously super enhanced abilities. And some being completely useless to the story. \n\n\n\nAlso i hope none of you feel that offended over my ichigo and goku bit. It just feels comparable tho. Carla is a obnoxious character and is somehow able to compete with them both combined. I like both btw. But I have to state facts, they do have a lot of plot armor. Not as much as Carla tho LOL.",

Thats when A user (Lets call them Raph since they were Rping as him), And Another user I'll call M. DMed me And told me to look in the chat, And so i did. And This one person Ill call VA, Was Saying how they were bad people in my chat and Was butting heads With M. After a while they left before i got on. \n\nAs organizer i checked everyone out and we dropped it, (The user playing donnie made A private chat so we could continue). But VA Was almost always Harassing users, Bullying them, And causing drama, They also pulled this on TMNT HQ!! When I was a temporary Curator on the amino M. Told me how VA Was causing drama again, So i brought it up to the other leaders and curators, And We decided to Strike him. But while a leader was talking to him. . . (Wait for it). . . HE THREATENED SUICIDE!! So We banned him permanently. But him threatening Suicide over a Strike was Uncalled for, It's not a huge deal to get a strike!!!! But to threaten to kill yourself over it IS JUST PLAIN WRONG!!! Anyway i hope you enjoyed reading this \ud83d\ude05",
