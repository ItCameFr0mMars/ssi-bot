            "selftext": "So I posted this in a different subreddit, but I'm posting this here as well because why not?\n\n**((Alright just a fair warning, this is gonna be a rather long story since there will be a lot to bring up and discuss. Everything might not be 100% accurate since this did happened back in 2015-2016 and a lot has happened since then. Regardless, if you have the patience or not, please do be advised. Other than that, let's get right into the story.))**\n\nHere's some background.\n\nI was a part of a group based from DeviantART, and at the time our group was looking for a different chatting program that was better than Skype (this is around the time when Skype was declining as a service), and our previous choice was an app called Raidcall. Unfortunately, the Raidcall servers for the US discontinued as it was originally an Russian app, which led us finding and choosing the now so popular Discord. The time where this all began was around September 2015, so this was EARLY Discord where friends lists weren't even a thing (Ah, Baby Discord was such a strange creature). Here's the first bit of context, our group chat was relatively easy to join in at the time. Raidcall was not very popular and wasn't user friendly, so when we shift to Discord, we advertised our group chat and a lot of new people joined in (though of course you had to be a member on the DA group first before entering), which included the very man who would be the center of this story. We'll call him \"Kain\".\n\nRight off the bat, Kain was just, to put it lightly, *off*. For starters, he'll RP during normal/casual conversations, acting like if he was a character and would constantly derail discussions, and when called out he either acts like an idiot or just continued RPing. He eventually stop since sometime after that we made a roleplaying chat and all was good, but little did we know this was just the beginning of Kain's spiral into madness.\n\nBefore I continue, there's a bit more context I want to address first. 1) I had a huge crush on someone at the time and sometime after we joined Discord together we started dating and became a couple, she'll be significant to the story too so we'll call her \"Elise\". And 2) Me and several people (including Elise and Kain) RPed a lot together, so there were plots being developed and several characters being introduced, so a lot of people involved tend to take the RP seriously, I promise this is important. Anyways, let's continue with the story.\n\nThe first time where I started to have a bit of distaste towards Kain is when he ruined a future plot I was gonna start because of how stupidly busted his character was. At this point, I might as talk about his character because it is something to note. His character is practically his avatar, that being a fedora wearing, scythe wielding, dimensional shifting, half Eldritch-Bird man... Yeah I'm not making that up. He'll go on about how his character is corrupted by Elder Gods (yes the Lovecraftian ones) and his character was just basically an Edgelord. What's worse is that he'll make it known how powerful his character is, in fact, he was so stupidly strong that he would break pocket dimensions and would try and defeat one of my characters in one-shot. The worst part about all of this is that the guy would constantly god-mod, he didn't care what you do, he'll just do it for the hell of it because he thinks his character is somehow more important than everyone else. So when he was pulling this stunt with a plot that I wanted to start, I got pissed and just scrapped the plot entirely because I know he'll just ruin it even more if I did continue. It almost feels like you HAVE to be overpowered to even keep up with him because that's how bad it got.\n\nIf you think that was bad, OH BOY, that was nothing compared to everything else this guy did, and this is where the descent truly begins.\n\nThere's another guy involved who is significant in the story since he interacted with Kain and had to dealt with his BS the most, we'll call him \"Bear\". Bear was (and still is) a no-nonsense kind of guy who is one of the moderators of the server and is a veteran RPer. He was also one of the very few people who would call out Kain regularly, such as calling him out for god-modding and his general nasty behavior, and he has been very critical of Kain's character. So one day, Bear once again calls out Kain for the same shit (it was either god-modding or something along those lines), and Kain just went APESHIT, threatening to beat up and KILL Bear. This was out in the public and when I witnessed this I was pretty shocked. Thankfully, shortly after that Kain was banned, but unfortunately it was only temporary.\n\nHere's some more context to bring up. Basically how our group functioned is that we had a 3 strike banning rule. The first one would result in a temp-ban for a week. The second one would result in a temp-ban for a month. The third and final one would result in a full-blown perma-ban. I wont spoil much, but I think you guys have a good idea where this is going. Now back to the story.\n\nKain did eventually came back since it was a week long ban, and honestly not much happened for a while. Of course Kain continued with his usual BS, but at this point people just expected it and didn't do much about it, so it was whatever for the most part. Kain did eventually get banned again but I mostly forgot what happened, all I remember was that he caused a huge commotion and that got a lot of people talking and he basically just threatened EVERYONE involved (which was 10+ people I think? Again I can't remember much). Around this time, I was continuing my loving relationship with Elise and it was public knowledge at this point that we were a thing. Another thing to keep note is that both Elise and Kain hanged out and RPed a lot, as if they were close friends, and trust me... this is unfortunately important to the story.\n\nOnce Kain came back for the second time things were a bit strained with him and a few other people, myself included. He continued to RP but there wasn't really much to note except for the occasional god-modding. There were people who were still friends with him at the time, which is why he was kept around for as long as he did. At this point, I was kind of fed up with him. Not only has he made RPing not fun whenever he's around, but him basically threatening one of my friends and several other people just didn't sit well with me. Plus, I felt like he was going after Elise which really bothered me since we were a couple, but we'll get to that. In a way, I was sort of looking forward to the next time Kain messes up again, which led me into a direct involvement with Kain's final ban.\n\nI'll say right now, back then I was a self-righteous little shit and it isn't one of my proudest moments, so I guess at the time I wished I handled things better, but this is what essentially happened.\n\nSo one night, there was a big RP happening in the roleplaying room with one of the more popular RPers. There were a lot of people involved and because of this the room was off limits for anyone else who wanted to join, and Kain so happens to be one of them. Normally people would ask if they can join the RP, and if the people involved said no, they would just move on with their day. Kain on the other hand wanted to join so badly that he was forcing himself into the RP, not \"trying to\", WAS forcing himself into it without asking. This of course didn't sit well with anyone in the RP so they told him to back off, and Kain didn't take that too kindly as he quickly snapped at everyone. This kind of pissed me off, so I called him out as well and of course he snapped at me as well. I wasn't having it so I had the bright idea to directly confront Kain myself in DMs, and these are the following messages...\n\n**(Note: Once again I was self-righteous and I should've handled it better, not my proudest moment.)**\n\nMe:  \nYou know I can let the admins know about that comment you just said towards me, \"Sky stfu\".\n\nKain:  \n: |\n\nMe:  \nSo don't push your luck.\n\nKain:  \nSky  \nJust don't\n\nMe:  \nDon't think I wont, I ain't gonna let that slide you know.\n\nKain:  \nMaybe because you use this as a way to bully others due to how shitty your life is  \nIsn't it  \nGuess what  \nIt ain't cutting it\n\nMe:  \nI'm not bullying though. **((Oh god how unaware I was back then, this is cringing me.))**\n\nKain:  \nSo just ignore all of this and get on with your own life until it becomes even more shitty\n\nMe:  \nWow, are you seriously trying to make me feel bad or trying to get under my skin? I only said that I ain't gonna let your insult slide and now you're doing... *this*.\n\nKain:  \nNope  \nI'm not doing that  \nI'm only showing the obvious  \nNo wonder your brother bullies you  \nSky...  \nThere is a ***reason*** I believe your relationship with Elise won't cut it  \nbecause this world is not the internet  \nHer parents may be shocked at how battered you are by your *own family* and see you as an unsafe being  \nI'm not trying to insult you  \nThat can happen ***A LOT***  \nNow Sky  \nThat is my own two cents on **YOUR** situation in regards to the actual physical world  \nand not the internet  \nNow Sky  \nHere is my advice  \nGo onto some website and find something regarding what is going on  \nand not just CNN  \nOther news feeds  \nalso go research various cultures as well and the history behind it\n\nMe:  \nDude, I know you're trying to be philosophical but it's literally pointless. You're trying to breakdown my life without having a lot of knowledge of what my life is like, no shit the physical world is not the internet, do you think I am that stupid? No. Also, what does my family have to do with ANYTHING with this? I love my family, I don't like my brother, but I still love my family. So don't you dare think how my life is like because you don't even know it.\n\nKain:  \nWell  \nThen it is your loss  \nIf you think that way then why do I even bother  \n=\\_=  \nDon't cry on my shoulder then when shit goes down on your side\n\nMe:  \nDude, just fucking stop it already. You are coming off as pretentious. Me crying on *your* shoulder? Hell no. If anything stop thinking that you know everything because you don't, so just stop it, please.\n\nKain:  \nSky....  \nI am stopping  \nBut you are just keep on going on and on and on\n\nMe:  \nWell yeah because I ain't gonna let you say all of this false crap.\n\nKain:  \nFalse Crap?  \nSky....  \nIf my dad have met you, he would be very disappointed in you(edited)\n\nMe:  \n*YOUR DAD*!? What the fuck are you even talking about at this point? My dad is NOT your dad. You are literally not making any sense.\n\nKain:  \nSky  \nThis is on your head  \n\\--END--\n\n**(End of the exchange, again I should've handled it differently, but it's whatever now.)**\n\nSo yeah, the dude basically tried to ***\"psychoanalyze\"*** me, saying that my relationship with Elise wasn't good for her, thought that just because you watch the news you're somehow better? (Still not sure what he meant by that) Made several false assumptions about my life, and by the end of it all he just threatened me... Yeah, it was a shitshow.\n\nI mean nowadays I just laugh at it because this guy seriously can't be *this* delusional, I mean sure I was acting like a little shit, but GOD it was pretentious. However, at the time I'm not gonna lie that I was pretty shaken up by it, not just with the false assumptions about my life but also the threat at the end of it all. I felt scared that he might actually hurt me. So of course, after this exchange, I reported this to the Moderators and they took action. They decided to bring him into a private call, and unfortunately I wasn't there for it, but from what I heard they basically confronted him and he immediately got aggressive. He was making comments about how \"rose-tinted\" we are as a group, that he knows the \"real world\" because he watches the News, and have made disturbing comments like bombing an entire anime convention because he hated Anime and anything Japan (which is ironic because our group was based around a particular Japanese shoot-em-up game series). So yeah, the guy is fucking nuts.\n\nSo as you could imagine, the moderators were done with his ass and finally **perma-banned** him from the group. All the while he was calling us \"rose-tinted\" and \"goody goody two shoes\" because we \"focus too much on the good side\" and other BS. Yeah, this guy was an Edgelord through and through. I was finally relieved since now I no longer have to deal with the guy, but the story doesn't end there.\n\nNot too long after his perma-ban, he made a journal entry on DeviantART, bringing up stuff that happened with him and the group. I was one of the few people he mentions directly and said that he \"traumatized **\\[ME\\]** presumably to the point of no return\"... Like hell he did. He continues on how he can now do whatever he wants in terms of violence and political analogies, and ends it off by mockingly saying \"See you later **\\[Group Name\\]**. At least I have actual friends and goals to worry about now!\" as if he achieved something. To me, the jorunal entry is a joke and is just him stroking his own ego, nothing more.\n\nThe last thing involving Kain is something that I've learned recently from my now Ex-girlfriend, Elise (we're still good friends by the way). She mentions on how Kain confessed his love towards her and tried to get into a relationship with her DURING me and Elise's first year of being together. So not only did Kain had an obvious crush on Elise, but he tried to **weasel** into getting with her despite me and her being a couple at the time. Which is probably the reason why he brought Elise in our little exchange. Real smooth Kain, real smooooth.\n\n**And that's the story on how I got an Edgelord BANNED from a Group due to his own hubris and anger management issues.**\n\nI'll admit, I wasn't innocent during the whole ordeal, but considering his behavior and history, he would probably get perma-banned eventually even without my involvement. Because if it wasn't gonna be me, it would've been someone else. The guy was too arrogant to admit his faults and his vile behavior is what led him to his downfall, it's just so happens that I was the one to put the final nail in the coffin. I do feel a bit sorry for the guy since he probably acted this way due to a poor upbringing, but I'd rather not make assumptions and honestly I don't care too much. All I know is that he's out of my life and that's fine by me.\n\nSo to Kain, hope you're having a good time in the REAL world, you fucko!",

            "selftext": "so I roleplayed with someone a few years ago and they fit the bill for being the most bizarre person I\u2019ve ever met. Keep in mind that I\u2019ve literally roleplayed with furries and bronies. Great people. This one was an original roleplayer with pretty standard interests but was honestly a garbage person\n\n-obsession with making me jealous of their last partner/making my characters jealous of others\n\n-obsessed with height to the point where she would ignore and defame any male character of mine that happened to be under 6\u20190\u201d\n\n-initiated timeskips to avoid said characters, ignored characters of mine completely, acted condescending towards things I introduced (fair enough. Tell me when I\u2019m being bad. But...)\n\n-refused to OOC or talk about what might make her uncomfortable/annoyed. Usually I\u2019ve roleplayed with people who say \u2018hey don\u2019t call my character that\u2019 or \u2018hey we should do this with this pairing\u2019 and things really work well. She refused to OOC and so frequently things just fell apart and great things weren\u2019t realised because she didn\u2019t want to say how something should go\n\n-literally roleplayed with herself with every post. Would section off her posts and roleplay with her own characters. While I sort of understood why and found it interesting, seeing as the posts showed off characters and powers my characters wouldn\u2019t be able to see, they would roleplay literal romance scenes and fights concerning characters mine hadn\u2019t even met or had any relevance with\n\n-introduced ideas and concepts without regard for the plotholes. While I don\u2019t like putting down people for lacking prose or chops, as I know some people are great storytellers and partners regardless of ability, she would introduce concepts that absolutely shatter the current roleplay\n\nE.g. time travel. My character is faced with a conundrum where a loved one will be killed by a plot mechanism that stops the antagonists, no matter where they are (science and magic and shit). I wonder why we can\u2019t exactly just move the character with time travel to evade the plot mechanism entirely. Many such plotholes and bizarre things which usually resulted in me being called paranoid for questioning\n\n-narcissism. I didn\u2019t realise it until my now girlfriend pointed out the absolute bullshit their apology message was filled with. They never owned up to a single thing they did, obscenely patted themselves on the back for apologising at all and just made reference to their ego. Constantly fetishised control and mind games\n\n-suggested my main character rape a character while they\u2019re drunk under the justification that theirs would realise in the morning that they were \u2018made to be\u2019\n\n-fetishised bipolar disorder",

            "selftext": "Me and this one rper were trying to do a story setting and some world building, because I wanted to try out my hand at it...and...now that alot of the rose-tinted glasses are gone...I can look at it and say with confidence...his rp was trash.\n\nSo...pretty much I've made this world with you know the traditional races and stuff...and some variation...and...to make a long story short for the time being...this one guy i'm rping with seems to dislike conflict of any kind...\n\nThe Cannibalistic Dark Elves that would raid the other races for things they want? Suddenly not cannibalistic and overall pretty cool now because of..divine influence, despite that same divine making them into what they were. The wood elves with a racial hatred of Orcs...never brought up again...like ever\n\nMy Goblin blacksmith, who for a long time, was the only civilized Goblin known because she was raised from childbirth by a human, is now the Goblin empress with magical powers that can solve anything with them, and, as many times stated by him, had an increase in height for his personal preferences...because I guess short people aren't good or royal?  \n\n\nAnd this wasn't like...a short increase in height, she was as tall as an elf...because...reasons? I never brought up her height again...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crux of our rp seemed to always center around the Goblins, in particular, the Goblin Empress, who **was** my favorite character till he ruined her. It's essentially a world where Goblins are feral pests, but she was rescued and raised from infancy by a human blacksmith, who didn\u2019t just think she was an animal.\n\nShe grew up civilized, but had to accept that she had to stay in hiding in this biased world.\n\nMy idea was for her to grow up and become an advocate of Goblins everywhere and prove they weren\u2019t animals but were still effected by circumstance. She\u2019d discover there was a Goblin Empire in the ancient past, but giving them an Empire now would get rid of the theme of Goblin prejudice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got as far as showing off what ferals were like and how this character interacted with the world, before an angel came down to the Planet, and found Civil Goblin, and awakened her powers and saved all the Goblins from the curse that made them ferals.\n\nYou know...despite this being a problem that\u2019s dated for so long, people just thought this was natural of Goblins...despite an ancient Bloodline realistically suppose to have been killed off after so long...nope...every Goblin is now civilized\n\nI tried to work with this, I really did...I tried to make it more of a gray area. Like she\u2019d insist on reacquiring land for a kingdom (not a whole empire) and it explore the ramifications of a people being told they should surrender their land they\u2019ve had for many years on years...and instead...it was given with no complaint by the humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made the human foresters, who are made up of displaced Goblin hunters who are very open about how they feel about the Goblin menace and would find support among other people that felt such a way while also acting as scouts and wilderness defenders to human and human allied races...but nope...everyone, even humans, hates them...and they are now being vilified by humans...despite not even a few years back Goblins were killing indiscriminately.  \n\n\nI used plenty of chances to try and paint the Empire as a theocracy, who worshiped the angels with a great fervor and would try to make deify the Empress and her bloodline...but an angel came down and insisted to not worship angels openly. The angels became his go to to solve all the problems...\n\nThe Goblin skirmishers, who were just a scout order of Goblins that relied on many of the methods to sneak and ambush they had picked up as ferals...were now just tribal Goblins that worshiped one really buff, muscular Goblin...and this never came up again because around this time I realized how trash this was becoming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I tried to make a new sub-race of Goblin called the sand Goblins. They lived in the far east desert and were largely enslaved by the Demon worshiping humans...wanna know how that turned out? It turns out, the one Sand Goblin that had escaped slavery...**WAS ALSO DESCENDED FROM THE OLD EMPRESSES BLOODLINE AND WAS AWAKENED AS WELL!**\n\nHow a sand Goblin was a royal, despite being descended from the Goblins that fled from the curse and war of ancient times...I don\u2019t know...\n\nBut I never brought up Sand Goblins again...I was just getting tired of all the solutions to problems being just easily given.\n\n The two most recent stories before I finally stopped rping with him dealt with three conquering overlords\n\nAs usual, i\u2019m the one who initiates the story...I made a Orc that had grown sick of the treatment of Orcs and had decided to take back Orcish land and forge an Empire for Orc-kind to prosper. She had a hatred of Goblins because as it turned out, she was from the ancient past and the last thing she remembered before being flung to the future was the war on Goblins (I\u2019ve accepted that this is bad story telling and would avoid time travel if given the chance to re-do that story line)\n\nOf course, before exploring the whole stigma of an Orc conquering to make a better future for her people while having unjustified hatred for an entire race...a Goblin elder convinces her that not only should she start exploring diplomacy instead, but also proves that Goblins aren\u2019t bad and that she should avoid hating them through her new Goblin power of both looking into the past bloodlines and allowing others to do the same (something all Goblins can do now?) Also, her half-orc daughter or something...descended from the overlord.\n\nSecond one, a human overlord and her two daughters are conquering the land. That\u2019s all I gave him for story, and I was fine with whatever narrative he went..so this is less me complaining since this was more for him...apparently, God told his character she had to conquer all the lands to save it...and she had superhuman abilities...and of course, she was ONLY benevolent and would leave the former rulers in charge with no issues because of her diplomacy skills\n\nHis overlord even killed my Orc Warlord...than resurrected her to lead her people against this dark, end of the world scenario. I think it\u2019s shit, but I\u2019m more excited for the idea of actual conflict...\n\nAnd now my third one...MY Demon Overlord.\n\nSo I was never given anything to go off of as to what this threat even was save it'd devastate the world if the nations didn't stand as one...fine stuff...so I decided to make a big bad and one that had been, for too long, culled...Demons!\n\nYou see, in our world, Demon inhabit the plane of Hell...I even had what I thought was a cool explanation for what they were...but in events I've largely put out of my mind, Demons were no longer evil, but actually chill and good people, and Hell was a utopia now. I hated this decision, even back when I was at peak cool with this boy...so I decided to remind the world that a demon could always be a threat by having a Demon rebel and go to the mortal plane to conquer it.\n\nshe took over cities, killed these angels easily, and enslaved whomever she desired. She would be the big bad, and she would be able to contend with all the world's unified people...and than the angels...it's always, the angels...\n\na whole army of angels came down to the one city she had been inhabiting, and put up a magical, holy barrier around it to stop her from leaving. No big deal...this Demon had slain angels before and was making a throne of bones...so the angels march into the town, decimate her forces and enter into the Town hall (important) and began the fight.\n\nOne angel led the charge...and my Demon was mopping the floor with her and had even broken her wings...so naturally the whole army came and started throwing spears at her and without any chance, was impaled on them,...but at this point I was tired of this nonsense and she took it like a champ...and than the God modding. One angel suddenly came and took her head clean off, no problem\n\nExcept I kept rping it as her blocking and even repulsing these attacks, because that was bullshit, and the angels threw more spears at her?! So, she charged the angels to take them out...and in response, the angels took to the air, within the enclosed space of a town hall and dodged the attack easily.\n\nThe Uber strong, holy warrior angel than came and swung for her hands. I blocked the attack...and still lost my hands...so I charged to rip into her throat...and had a sword in my throat before it was popped off....one session, Demon came and went...I didn't even respond after that because I finally grew tired of all that nonsense...",

Before I make any character who has a power of some kind I do a lot of research on what their power is.\n\nI think really it's feeling like they are assuming that I'm dumb.\n\nThe problem is that I am really conflict avoidant so I tend to let it slide for a while before I finally flip out.\n\nsuch as in the past I let a partner and get away with it for a little bit before I finally said to him; \"I'm getting the feeling that you're talking down to me.\"\n\nI probably could have chose my words better but I was trying not to make a big deal out of it up until that point.\n\nJust like everyone else he then proceeded to unfriend me.\n\nTherein lies the second problem. Whenever I do try to speak up about it I don't know if maybe it's because of the tone I use, or if me telling them to stop over explaining at me is some kind of personal attack on them, but they leave.\n\nSo I need to figure out how to get across to people that I don't like having long-winded explanations thrown at me without them throwing a fit and leaving.",

            "selftext": "This is going to be really long, I apologize in advance.\n\nRecently I joined a roleplay that takes place in a multiplayer game.  Core playerbase is only about 20 people.  There are mods that allow for roleplay mechanics, such as rolling a dice for skill checks.  There aren't any hard rules - you can set your skills as high or low as you like.  It's generally understood that you should make a balanced character, but really strong mages and such are okay too.\n\nThe way skill rolling works is this: You emote an action, then you roll for the skill related to it.  Like block, luck, agility, etc.  It's up to you which skill you want to roll for, even if multiple skills might come into play.  The other player rolls a skill in response, and then types a response based on the numbers.\n\nI play a pure warrior character who knows NO healing magic, teleport magic, any magic at all, and has unenchanted weapons.  In this setting magic isn't rare, but becoming powerful at it is, and there are PLENTY of non-magic NPCs fleshing out the world.\n\nMy problem is that I feel like I am the only person playing a balanced character.  Everyone around me is a master mage who is already 1000 years old, or a necromancer, or someone with the most OP demon armor set in the entire game and walks around town in it like that's normal.  My character has not won any fights so far because I roleplay realistically and these characters use magic against me, which there's really no escape from.  When I do try to attack people, they just teleport away from me.\n\nEarlier I got in a large RP-battle with a certain player who I generally like.  At least, he's one of the only people willing to RP combat with me.  Most of the people here are slice-of-lifers, which I find boring, so even though I find this guy a little edgy I want to be on good terms with him because, to be blunt, he's my only option if I wanna do combat.\n\nThe problem is that he has a magic knife which disintegrates armor, and a magic sword with mind control abilities - if it touches you, you'll stop being aggressive.  \n\nEvery time he would get a bad roll, he would roll 3 more times in an attempt to get a good roll.  For example, I shot him with a crossbow.  He rolled agility to dodge, then rolled his armor skill to see if it penetrated, then rolled endurance to see if it would hurt him, etc.  What he is doing is not against the rules. However, no one else repeatedly rolls skills.  Most people roll once and then take the result, unless its a really complicated situation.  (Like, magic arrows that cast a spell when they hit.)\n\nIn other occasions, I have literally hit people in the face with a hammer and they hardly react.  One guy literally said \"he was bruised.\"  Really, that's all?  Not knocked back at all??\n\nI am considering being cheesy with my replies, but I feel like a dirty rat doing it.  For example, I got hit with the mind control sword, and I went along with it, RPing my character getting calm and passive.  Since its up to you to write your own responses, I could have easily chose to write something like my character getting slightly calmer, but not enough for it to have any affect or make her stop fighting.  I don't like this.  I don't want to make a damned OP character or cheese my rolls, but it's the only way for my character to ever WIN against these people, or even get away unscathed.\n\nI am especially upset because of what happened to me earlier: edgelord used his magic sword to disintigrate my character's armor, and then tried to carve his name on her naked body in a very brutal way.  I must tell you in all honesty that I had previously told him I'm okay with nonconsent/sexual violence stuff, so I have only myself to blame, but it was too far for me.\n\nUgh, I guess I already know I'm going to get people telling me I'm right and he's in the wrong.  I just wish I could know for certain if he was out of line or not and not be hugboxxed.",

            "selftext": "A plot twist can be good if it had context and does correlate well with the story. However, if it is inconsistent... that's where that plot twist becomes a plot hole.... like seriously... not every plot twist is going to blow people's minds. Some plot twists are confusing and bad. This one is really bad. \n\n\nAlright so, me and my best friend haven't been replaying since 2 months ago. Yeah, that's a very long time. And his OC who I called Bryan last time I posted here is really OP. But honestly I can change that..... no one seems to care that he is ridiculously op. But when it comes to me and my best friend roleplaying... it's not just the characters that make a story... it's the story itself..... \n\n\n\nSo, in our first storyline ever the villain who Is a \nDEMON OVERLORD... dies by getting his head ripped off by Bryan. Yes he dies and my best friend didn't even get my permission to kill my villain OC. Jeez, and whats worse he calls my villains \"cheaters\". WHAAAAAT!?!?!?!?! Yeah, I didn't include this last time because that was focused on the OP characters he possess. This time it's plot holes..... \n\nHis OC calls my villain characters \" cheaters\". That's the most ironic statement I've ever seen. His OC has like a million different abilities and is impossible to defeat. Yet he calls my villain characters \"cheaters\". Why are they cheaters? Because you're jealous that my characters can compete with your plot armor Bryan?? Like, I was baffled.... And I didn't even know what to say. \n\n\n\nHowever, in a later roleplay, we have a confrontation between the son of the demon overlord and Bryan himself talking about his father's death and how Bryan killed him..... \n\n\nAnd you know, my best friend decided... \" Hey, it's plot twist time!!!\" And I was not ready for the plot twist... I mean.. even he knows Bryan killed his father who was the DEMON OVERLORD!! And yet he makes that plot twist that another person killed his father yet in the moment it did happen he was the one that killed his father!!!!! And what's worse is that.... later on.. currently in the roleplay that we were in before my best friend went away and hasn't spoken to anyone in general..... it's confirmed that Bryan did in fact kill his father the DEMON OVERLORD!!!!!!! WTF!!!??? So... what is this plot twist to be exact....???!! I've officially been mind crushed. \n\n\n\nI guess I don't need Yugi and his millennium puzzle to blow my mind... I have this plot twist that makes zero sense... how are you going to have the plot twist that somebody else that looks identical to Bryan kill the DEMON OVERLORD?? BUT THEN HAVE ANOTHER PLOT POINT THAT CONFIRMS THAT BRYAN DID INDEED KILL THE DEMON OVERLORD!!!?!?!?!? Like, I do not get it at all.... it legit makes zero sense...... you can't have a character that legitimately killed the villain have a plot twist that somebody else killed the villain even though they were NEVER brought up before.... to have YET another plot twist that Bryan did kill him even though that was ALREADY TRUE!!!! WTF!!!??? \n\n\n(Sighs) I'm sorry. But here are plot twists that would've worked much better. Maybe not perfectly... but better. \n\n\n- Have the demon overlord be the true father of Bryan. But of course not since Bryan wants to be all innocent and all... And hates demons so that wouldn't work......( star wars anybody??) \n\n\n- Have the demon that is the son of the demon overlord that witnessed his death be related to Bryan in any way. \n\nLook, I know he means well but this plot hole is the only one that bothers me.... And it makes no sense. I questioned him in frustration.. And I'll admit he questioned by so called \" Plot Holes\" \n\n\nHe asked how my main oc.... well former main OC how did he die if he was too strong to die? He asked it because he was getting mad at me.. even though we both knew his plot hole made no sense. \n\n\nI legitimately confirmed it weeks before this roleplay  guys. I literally texted him in the storylines where my main OC dies that he had physical problems...... And weeks after he acts like he was in perfect shape.... \n\nMy main OC died because he doesn't need plot armor to be bad@$$ that's why. He went out like a hero and did what he feared. Dying in honor. Heck, he does question this out of anger.  \n\n\nWe soon apologized and reconciled but he hasn't roleplayed with anyone or even talked to anyone in 2 months. And honestly.... I need some suggestions to fix this plot hole. I have one suggestion that we both need characters sheets. Now I need help with this one guys.....",

                    "selftext": "So the GM quite obviously has his pet faction and his own metaplot he wants his game to be railroaded/led towards.\n\nTo protect this pet faction's interest and his own endgame (eventhough they are always on about the whole worldbuilding and not victory spiel), GM had to take steps to make sure they don't get whittled down by opposition (of two players out of nearly 40!) I think the protectionism/favoritism to this faction is also quite obvious because barring the players which joined it from the start for RP/flavour reasons, some people jumped ship for the benefits it provided after it was listed out (a giant head start!) which was also a point for contention recently.\n\nSo yeah, the two players who actually opposed them had a lot of finger wagging from other players if others didn't try to actively hinder them at the behest of the pet faction. One (who succeeded in blowing up one of the faction's bases with a very limited player power) was immediately attacked by another \"threat\" in game world immediately losing them a unit (no roll!) and then being forced to burn 5 actions on a project (players also only get 5 actions a turn) or suffer the repercussions.\n\nYou probably see the sort of nonsense I'm trying to portray present in this here game..\n\nAnyway because of the actions of the two, the pet faction had to cry for help for the other powers (players) to send them units in return for favor and reputation. Seeing the chance in the vulnerability, I gave an outline of my plan which the head GM kinda okayed (albeit there was some argument there as well)\n\nIf you want to know the argument, it was basically my group giving strong vocal support to the faction from the start, even risking aggression from one of the aforementioned two by fighting em in a public forum to humiliate/shut them up with their dangerous ideas. Not to mention public endorsement that the faction's ways were beneficial to everyone so we should uphold them (and this was before I actually proposed this idea too) being completely irrelevant in his eyes.\n\nAnyway this GM insisis it had to be hard because I don't have the mechanics to support this (in the reputation system) I'm like fine, but due to some things he also said I pointed out that 1) no one has tried this before so they wouldn't be alert against it, 2) If not an obvious friend to them (because rep) I am an obvious enemy to the other two, 3) the faction requested for the units, I didn't initiate offers so there is also no reason to suspect subterfuge, 4) the faction is distracted by the other two and some other stuff I can't remember. Again completely irrelevant even though he has considered completely irrelevant things to his benefit.\n\nBut on to the point for his firm denial. He didn't want anyone having an easy time against his pet faction. He was balancing against a hypothetical high statted player later on (who wouldn't be under the same conditions I\u2019ve pointed out above) a.k.a. \"balance\" (which is a joke since he gave one of the other players one of the most OP military powers ever which people spoke out against but he didn't seem to mind drafting/suggesting which made everyone feel it's a whole lot worse) And he was stupidly evasive on my stronger points especially on the topic I may as well do the easiest action (which someone already did) and suffer no repercussions even if I fail and would only cost one action so he can't be proven wrong.\n\nFor comparison, I\u2019d have to spend one of my limited secret actions (1/turn) over two turns, send them a total of four units to reach the rep requirements (so ordinarily an action to raise each unit separately, and two more actions to send em) and then make two separate rolls to not get caught and get out with the information I\u2019m scouting for. Eight actions all together!\n\nFinally after telling him off (because of his insincere assertions he can\u2019t communicate this well enough or actually consider everything for the sake of \"balance\") I told him I\u2019ll drop it and reach his stupidly expensive reputation requirements and, make sure I do everything I can to cap the rep since he suggested more rep = an easier time to execute my plan just to be by the rules and so there would no longer be any argument for why I can't do it.\n\nI think you can predict what happened next. Spoiler: I predicted what would happen next when I told him in DMs, \u201cI bet I can mathematically try to pull rep 3 or at least rep 2 now by the next round to attempt this now that you've pointed out reps\nBut I bet at that point, you'll just throw more reasons for why it should be hard for me so I don't think it is in my interest to invest in that, especially since that would mean I already commited 1 round\u201d\n\nAlso, in the end I was fed up and actually did everything to reach rep 4 which is the highest there is based on the benefits he said I might get from high rep.\n\nSo next round even more arguments. Because the GM wanted his pet faction to benefit from his overall plans, he stealthily changed his faction\u2019s actions to attend an event so other factions can send units to them. The problem? His faction never even did a single thing ICly in that event which put me at a super disadvantage because despite poring through the event IC thread and the main game IC thread daily to see if I have competition for the units (first batch sent gets even more rep of in case of ties a dice off) I didn\u2019t see any constructive sign of any such act because there was no evidence of the faction being in the thread and the other person sending units hid his actions in a sub action that no one would ordinarily look through.\n\nAfter some argument which ended with him asking how to make things right, I gave him a suggestion which he used to try and turn against me because I\u2019m asking for special treatment while I was complaining about the GMs\u2019 special treatment for vets and the faction. Bzzt. Wrong. I only asked to be put into the position of what I would have gotten had everything been done properly; like a court of law would have given during a contractual issue since I\u2019ve been acting in reliance of the GM\u2019s rules/rulings/clarifications all this time.\n\nTo his credit the GM went over and above with my suggestion but obviously it was too good to be true because cue the current round.\n\nHe sent me a DM which is pretty much the equivalent of \u201chey! I know you invested everything into this and are doing this secretly but the moment you go through with this, the faction will know its your fault immediately without even having to investigate (despite investigations being a specific action by rules which has to be rolled for, so much for rules huh?) and they will hate you (a.k.a. I suspect he means I will suffer the same treatment as the other two players which went against them previously) or you can waste yet another action and make a roll to avoid being hated which if you fail will mean them hating you to the same level anyway. But I\u2019m so nice and don\u2019t want to fuck you over (*cough* yeah right *cough*) I\u2019m giving you the option and the chance to play nice with my pet faction by not ruining everything I've got planned by releasing the info early.\n\nYeah fuck you, you deadass hamster.\n\nFuck you especially when I\u2019ve specifically mentioned when I suggested this plan my units were going to scout the no man\u2019s land the faction was protecting on their own (pretenses of border patrol or whatever) (hell one of the reasons I should actually get them back but I acquiesced to the GM anyway that those units have to be lost for reasons eventhough they are never going to be under the faction's control) but somehow out of the blue, the GM insists that my entire plan is stealing information from them which I never once mentioned so that, in his own words, he can force consequences. \n\nF-O-R-C-E C-O-N-S-E-Q-U-E-N-C-E-S even if you succeed in the perfect crime!\n\n\u201cThey will know that something is up if you steal their information. They still have to roll. If you roll much higher than them, they will be more confused as to what is happening, but still suspect you.\"\n\"Steal stuff: Take consequences. Don't steal stuff: don't suffer consequences.\"\n\"That's just how it's going to be.\u201d\n\nTl: dr; the GM wants to force on consequences to punish me despite his already punishing conditions which I\u2019ve already fulfilled to continue protecting his pet faction and his metaplot to the point he is willing to deliberately misinterpret things to his benefit, reiterate everything into his own words and points despite being obviously contrary to what was already agreed and so on. Therefore he has to assert that I\u2019m stealing regardless of the plan despite me not doing so because that is the only way to make sense of punishing me eventhough throughout all this other than the fact he is the head GM, he makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nTotally called it since (like I mentioned earlier) because I sensed he was exhibiting bad GMing behavior from the start (a lot like one of my previous GMs I may share in this sub later, if I can find the post in the PF sub). The shithead should have just been straight and told me outright he didn\u2019t want me to fuck with his beloved faction or his metaplot so I wouldn\u2019t have wasted three rounds of planning, mathing and actions to do this so I could have done something achievable by his rules instead (a.k.a. use the 4 units I sent him to attack/bully someone else or use the actions to take over other regions or just explore)\n\nA few of the players know I\u2019m already ditching out of this game in a few turns because of this bullshit and though they have tried to convince me to stay, they know my reasons are also valid. The only reason I\u2019m staying at all for the time being is to make good for some other players who have made investments on my fun. On another point, a different horror story where I'll likely be the horror player because with nothing to lose and his antagonizing me, the poor guy is going to be crippled by the end of these three turns for a significant amount of time. No reason other than starting something at the wrong time before I leave. Lol. Probably a story for another time.\n\nBut yeah like I told the other players, I'm totally out of this game and will not be in any future games for as long as this shitstain is a head GM calling the shots. Because its quite obvious he can't be trusted with that responsibility.",
