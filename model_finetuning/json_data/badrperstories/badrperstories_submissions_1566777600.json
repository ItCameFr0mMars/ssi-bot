            "selftext": "This is going to be more of a generic rant rather than actual 'BadRPer Story' but bear with me. \n\nSo, I've been roleplaying for a while now and this has always bothered me, nowadays even more; female characters and how they're portrayed. \n\nThere's basically only a handful of pre-determined slots every female character MUST fit and it just annoys me:\n\n1. The attractive badass dominatrix who wastes every man they come across and are so, so, so very cold. Bonus points if lesbian. Falls for the angelic shy girl.\n2. The attractive, angelic shy girl. Can't take care of themselves, refuses to see reason. Usually used as a prop LI for the badass, hardened male character.\n3. The attractive leader-type, not to be confused with the badass dominatrix even if they're really similar. Supposedly the \"respected leader\", usually has some sort of military background yet never portrays any actual leadership qualities, keeps making stupid decisions, falls for some psychopathic edgelord.\n4. The attractive mean-girl who is not \"secretly\" quite so mean. LI for the shy, smart nerd character. \n\nAnd the god damn rape backstory. Why is it that every time female characters need SOMETHING to agonize over, it's the damned sexual abuse story. If it's not a backstory, you can bet your ass the character is gonna get sexually abused during the story. And most of the time, this never actually has any real effects on how the character behaves or feels about themselves, it's always just used as an excuse for their ever-burning hate for ALL THE MALES yet they secretly long to be loved and healed by some toxic dickhead. NO! Stop doing this, just STOP. \n\nI've been roleplaying for ten years and I can honestly count with one hand fingers the times I've seen an actual, fully-fleshed out female character who doesn't get raped or used as a one-dimensional LI. Post-apoc genre is notorious with this shit. For some reason, people seem to feel that a violence against female characters needs to be sexual. No, come up with something else. Girls can get hurt without getting raped.",

            "selftext": "This RP hasn't started yet, but already I'm getting major warning signs from another person. I might update this in case something does happen. \n\nSo I have a female character. She's tall, I guess to some people she's pretty (I tried to make her sort of attractive to my liking, so I explained her face and didn't just say \"she is really pretty!\") but she's not interested in romance. She has a dream man, but that doesn't mean she won't go for anyone else. Anyways, she's more of a loner and hides around in the castle a lot because she's one of the princesses there. \n\nSomeone else made a knight character, and of course they named them Ash. Who doesn't name their badass character Ash. So that's what their code name is going to be in this. Ash's character is a crappy asshat who is described as being mean and breaking women's hearts. He is a knight. His description was described as being \"really handsome and lots of women love him, but who could possibly get him? He's tall, and strong too.\" \n\nI passed off this character thinking he was only going to be background noise in the RP, because of his vague personality and such. If he was attracted to anyone, he'd be attracted to the main, more outgoing princess anyways, right? WRONG. I got a PM from Ash saying \"Hey, our characters are a lot alike. Maybe they could get together.\" I was thinking that they weren't, but I went to go check on the Sign-Up. The person edited their character to mirror mine's personality, of course with the added ass. \n\nIt should be noted, my character Savina is a very sensitive person. I gave no description of her dream man because of well-this. Someone trying to be him. She isn't at all looking for love. So why is this person trying to force their jerk onto mine? (oh uh... I mean... it's metaphorical! i think...) \n\nI never replied. I get too nervous when I turn people down in this kind of stuff because they might think I was trying to be mean. I thought they'd get the hint. Again, I am proved wrong. \n\n\"I'm not one for the whole planned crushing thing lol. That never happens in the real world. Maybe they could just be could friends... and then something more..?\" Ash says. I kinda just ignored that for a good two hours before I said \"Only time will tell!\" Ash hasn't yet responded. It's only been a day, so maybe they gave up. I'll update this if something else happens because it's fun to talk about drama, admit it.",

            "selftext": "Okay! So. I'm in a discord server for a pan-fandom setting, and most everyone in there is an utter gem. The setting's pretty typical these days (everyone's trapped in a sadistic murder game- Think something like Zero Escape or Your Turn To Die), but everyone's been bringing their own unique spins on it, and they're all great.\n\n...Except for this one player, let's call them R.\n\nI try to be easy on R, since almost everyone in the server is a pretty experienced, veteran rper, and we're all mature enough to not let one bad person ruin our rp, but you can only submit so many samey, obstructive ocs to the rp before people start getting annoyed. \n\nR has committed two murders, in-universe, and both trials have been laughably easy. To the point where everyone ic has to make their characters take a whole bunch of stupid pills to make sure the case isn't solved immediately and ruin any tension. I ignored it pretty well before the second case where this one character of R's- Let's call him Hammer, completely obstructed the case.\n\nFor further context, Hammer is your typical 'shy' character. He's meek, quiet, and 't-t-talks l-l-l-like t-t-t-this'- Which, you know, is pretty annoying, but I'd be less annoyed by it if R stayed consistent with it as a quirk (which they didn't). More to the point, Hammer was *uncomfortably* child-coded- He constantly carried around a toy mallet (and EVERY post R made detailed how he would 'grip his hammer tightly'), he got food all over himself whenever he ate, and his room was filled to the brim with toy chests. All this despite Hammer being seventeen, according to R, which just pushed him into 'horribly creepy' territory for me. \n\nHammer also covered for a murderer, and we were expected to still like him.\n\nTo take a step back, the murder he covered for was committed by R's second character, Duck, who Hammer had loaned his gloves to. Duck, in response, left them at the crime scene, and the only clue we got that Hammer himself had not used them was Hammer wearing food stained gloves to the actual trial. Except, Hammer would not say who he gave his gloves to... Meaning he was one of the two only people being implicated. Other than Duck.\n\nR had the nerve to get upset about this.\n\nEither way, it was made obvious it was Duck, and my character (let's call her Rabbit), called Hammer out on attempting to obstruct the trial. Rabbit is generally played as single-minded, determined, and is one of the most in-universe useful people in the trials- So, her calling Hammer out on keeping the trial from moving forward was completely ic.\n\nHammer attempted to kill her. And R started taking potshots at Rabbit ooc, saying she deserved to die for saying less than kind things to Hammer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFucking yikes.",

            "selftext": "Heyo everyone. This is my first post here and I wanted to share some stories from my few yet very fun years of rp. I do lots of different genres of rp and have many cool whacky characters but I decided to pick three and share them. Warning for nsfw references (like i\u2019m Not going to explicitly explain anything it\u2019s just a warning that it\u2019s hinted cause that\u2019s what happened.) now onwards to the first story.\n\nStory 1: the dragon who wouldn\u2019t be human.\nI\u2019m a very proud owner of so many dragon characters I should go to counselling, I love dragons and many of them have cool stories but my favourite one, we\u2019ll call him W because that\u2019s what his name starts with, probably gets the best and the worst rp partners sometimes. I was rping with W one day and came across a human character who was willing to rp with him. We\u2019ll call them k because their character was a female knight and that\u2019s a bit of a jump from the usual damsel seeking Knight. We started chatting and discussing and were about five minutes into the rp itself before K messages me ooc. The conversation looked like this:\nK: hey uh does your character turn into a human?\nMe: no why?\nK: because i\u2019m A hopeless romantic and wouldn\u2019t mind some KxW shipping.\nMe: sorry, i\u2019m Not a fan of the whole dragon turning human thing for several reasons.\n\nI\u2019m always wondering if I should\u2019ve regretted that sentence because K then went on to demand that W become a human somehow so she could ship K with him. I pointed out that regardless if W could turn human K would still be having a romance with a dragon. After five minutes of arguing that it was different K then proceeded to forcefully change W into a human to suit her tastes before immediately going down on the poor fellow. At this point I was starting to get a bit mad, I absolutely hate it when people forcefully change a character that they don\u2019t own. In fact I stopped the rp and left a message before leaving the rp itself. I ran into her a little while later since the site I used was a roulette chat site and she tried to victimise herself in hopes I\u2019d be guilt shamed into rping. This was what she said:\n\nK: why did you leave? I only wanted a romance with your character. This character never gets romance.\nMe: well i\u2019m Sorry about that but you don\u2019t control my character.\nK: I wouldn\u2019t have had to if you rped properly.\n\nK then proceeded to hurl insults and pitiless woe at me for five minutes before I left. Haven\u2019t run into them since but don\u2019t really expect them to have changed much if I do.\n\nStory 2: the half alien who wasn\u2019t human enough.\nThere seems to be a very big thing of making half alien characters that look only human with maybe non human coloured eyes or other unnoticeable features. I prefer the opposite where they look alien but with a mix of human traits. My half alien character, who we\u2019ll call C, is a character who looks more alien than human but is still distinguishable from a non hybrid of his species. I was discussing a rp with someone on discord and was going to be using C. The person I was going to rp with, we\u2019ll call E. E asked for a description of C and I did so, it was less than three seconds before they immediately started a ten paragraph spchiel of how they couldn\u2019t rp with my character because they were not human enough. I\u2019m not going to plague you with the ten paragraph word vomit they sent me so i\u2019ll Condense it down. Here is the condensed conversation:\n\nE: there are several reason I cannot rp with this character.\nMe: (confused) why not?\nE: they are not human enough.\nMe: well duh, he\u2019s half an alien.\nE: exactly! I don\u2019t want to do *insert smut here* with an alien.\n\nNow we hadn\u2019t in anyway discussed smut or even romance so I was confused as to why this was a problem. I voiced that of course and got the most patronising response in return.\n\nMe: we haven\u2019t even discussed romance, also I don\u2019t even do smut with any of my characters.\nE: well you\u2019re obviously a bit slow in mental functionality if you think I\u2019d be content doing just a boring platonic rp.\nMe:........okay then.\n\nIt was after that response I decided that I\u2019d had enough and blocked and unfriended E. So what if my character isn\u2019t some handsome white skinned human? We had no voiced intention of doing romance so I didn\u2019t see how it was a big deal, I still don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like a character purely because you do not think it\u2019d be something you\u2019d end then don\u2019t even bother wasting someone else\u2019s time and being so rude.\n\nStory 3:the Mary Sue.\nEveryone has run into one of these before, still surprising the antics they get up too. I was rping with W again and had found another dragon character, we\u2019ll call her D, and we were actually doing very well. Sure she was a bit powerful, she could breathe fire/water/earth/ice/electricity/etc and she was rather young to be a dragon to have mastered those powers in the way she did but since it was a dragon I didn\u2019t think much of it. W has power over storms and ice so again the power dynamic didn\u2019t seem too much to me. However it was about maybe a few hours in that the Mary sueness started to show. This was the first signs of it:\n\nD: so W did you know i\u2019m A princess of a dying race of dragons.\nMe: (wondering why this is of any importance) no.\nD: I\u2019ve been searching for so long on my own for others but it\u2019s been so hard to even find someone who looks remotely like my kind.\nMe: harsh.\n\nD then went onto explain how she was so young yet so powerful and perfect yet no dragon would take her as a mate because they deemed her too unworthy for some weird reason. Now W and D were not only two different kinds of dragons but absolutely nothing alike in appearance or mannerisms. It was after that little mention of her being a princess that she really started to amp up on the Mary sueness, always protecting W when he didn\u2019t need protecting, ruining rather major plot points just so she could show off how amazing she was and of course getting very colourful when describing her more intimate parts to poor W who most certainly had no interest whatsoever in that. I put up with it, not sure why I did. Maybe it was hope that this was just a phase or a part of her character development that she was just working through. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. When I next got onto discord (we were rping on there) I found out that she\u2019d typed a whole paragraph about how our dragons were mating with each other. It was rather explicit and I immediately without hesitation messaged her out of character. Here\u2019s the convo:\nMe: whoa dude! What the hell of going on?\nD: I was just writing about their romance.\nMe: they haven\u2019t been even remotely interested in each other.\n\nW and D had been having no romance whatsoever so I wasn\u2019t buying it. After I voiced this however D decided to tell me how I should be thanking her for writing an explicit Paragraph on dragon mating and how it was somehow a part of the story. Yeah no, it didn\u2019t. I eventually said my good byes and left. I will never stick around people who do this kind of stuff. No siree.\n\nWell there you have it folks, three stories that\u2019ll hopefully make you laugh,smile or just brighten your day. The moral to each of them is don\u2019t let people try to control, change or do things to your characters that you don\u2019t want them to do.",

            "selftext": "When I was 16 to 17, I joined a stupid forum where we would RP \"urban fantasy\". Basically a modern day, suburban setting, but with vampires, werewolves, witches, you know the like. It was a smaller community of about 10 regular members, all girls, 17-22 year olds. We all lived in a smaller European country, so same time zone, and we all lived pretty close to each other. (My current best friend, I actually got to know on this forum 'cause we both live in the same city.)\n\n1) There were these 2 girls who were in a RL relationship. Their main (straight) characters were also in a relationship. Sometimes, they would mention having sex in our common chat, WHILE they were claiming to be doing it. This was towards the beginning, too, so we were like wtf, keep that to yourselves, we don't even know each other??\n\n2) There was this really weird, neurotic user who would fall in love with every male character. It was so obviously just wish fulfillment for her. She'd have her female characters raped, abducted, get addicted, whatever she could do to get everyone's attention. In the end, she caused our forum's demise when she decided to try and turn everyone against a new user (that we invited to fill John's position, more on John below). \n\nShe also got into edibles and alcohol IRL, and she'd keep telling us about it.\n\nIRL, she literally showed up at another user's house, UNANNOUNCED. We don't know how she got the address, and they were on good terms, but still, creepy af.\n\n3) We had this dictator of a user whose character, John, was the \"alpha\" of our \"werewolf pack\". Mine was supposed to be the beta, he was literally 35 years old so I told this user that I don't want him sharing a fucking forest mansion with the rest of the pack. In the end she pressured me to go along with this ridiculous idea or else \"I can't have him be a werewolf\". She was SO fucking MAD all the time about everything, it was almost funny.\n\nAfter our first common threads with the whole werewolf squad, this person soon became a big meme. We still joke about John every now and then with the people I still talk to from the old crew. In our universe, werewolves would have to transform in order to gain their strength, otherwise they were mostly just normal people. But when this dude, John, got mad, we got paragraphs describing how he literally ran through the forest twice in his human form in a few minutes, destroying every pine tree in his way, and this was just a normal Tuesday for him. \n\nAfterwards, he got back to the pack's little frat house that the user insisted on, and decided to punish the pack member who was responsible for this. He treated everyone like his dog, even my beta who was supposed to be his advisor or something.\n\n4) There was this user who always wrote these female characters who HATED other women. When my character (a sheriff, while hers was a deputy) asked her why she chose this career, she replied she wanted a workplace where there were no women. She literally said something along the lines of \"all women were interested only in looking good and acting slutty\", except her, of course. It pissed me off so much as a woman myself, so my characters avoided her like the plague. She could sense I disliked her as a person, so she would always throw shade in the chat. \n\nOne time in the story there was this big crisis going on in the town, and her character blamed my sheriff for everything while defending her love interest (since I rejected her, although I wasn't looking for a LI for this character so yeah she never stood a chance). This caused a stir because my character was a pretty nice person who was known for overworking himself and deeply caring about the community. (He had his own flaws too, of course, but) he was the most popular character for a long time. So jokes on her, trying to dish me in-character didn't work.",

            "selftext": "I wasn\u2019t fully sure if I wanted to put this here since I\u2019m not sure if this person uses Reddit or if they just steer clear. Reason I\u2019m not sure is because they are a NSFW roleplayer. Me being 18+, I have no issues as long as my partner is also 18+. Makes things less awkward and the like.\n\nNow, as for why I am making this post. It\u2019s something that should have been dealt with in a more simple way. I respond better to, as everyone should, kindness. I understand different people have differing ideas. I for one usually don\u2019t like smutty roleplays. That being because it\u2019s not always handled in an appealing way. I am also not very good with the wording, so I feel I\u2019m not good enough for such a task.\n\nAs for why there was a problem, to put it simply, I wanted to make things interesting. Think of modern day feminism. If you have no clue what that is, basically a group of women being sexist. \n\nNow, please don\u2019t give me heat for this. I just wanted to make things interesting. Instead of actually being polite about it, as I would have understood and been more willing to come back, the person said they would not tolerate it. I understand, not your cup of tea. Easily could be changed. I didn\u2019t exactly make these characters to begin with, this person just told me to pick personalities. I went based of pictures. If I showed the picture, which I will not, then it be understandable why I chose this trait. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t seem like it was rude to anyone else, sorry. I see things the wrong way, but I saw that phrase to be quite rude. \n\nTo lighten my own mood, I thought of a theory that I killed the person\u2019s boner, lmao. \n\nAnyways, thank you for reading, and sorry if this didn\u2019t seem all that bad.",
