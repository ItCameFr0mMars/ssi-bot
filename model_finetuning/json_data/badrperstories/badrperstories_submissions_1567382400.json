It's a Forum RP where everyone needs to use Face Claims or Play By's (Pictures of celebrities).\n\nOkay, so, me and this particular roleplayer had a good thing going with our characters. I'm usually very picky about romantic subplots but we actually made it work, our characters had GREAT chemistry and writing their slooooow burn romance was actually something we both enjoyed. Until recently.\n\nMy partner dropped the romance between our characters in favour of another character. Because that character was using a FC that's been my partner's character's FC's love interest in one TV show they were together. My partner said they think the relationship between our characters is amazing and cute, but they just have to go with the other one because, quote:\n\n\"Then they'll have cute gifs and all the material!\" \n\nUgh.",

I'd never abandoned or drop you.\" Funny how a string of words can send instant regret and doubt into your head.\n\nThis is my 10th try with a person from Reddit. My 10th try to build a story with; plot, character development, thrilling action, little but of fluff and NSFW scenes to appeal to my partner[s]. I've always done everything to try and allow my partners comfort before my own. I make sure they are comfortable, they understand the posts, I stick to general themes they enjoy, I lead scenes a certain way they'd enjoy, I communicate, i plot and try to ask questions, I open my creativity and entertain the idea to build.\n\nFunny how; you can predict when people will ditch you without warning, not a single concern shown. No word how they don't like something, no word how they feel something else should happen, no feedback to how they dont like a certain thing. They just up and leave out of the blue removing you or blocking you..\n\nToo many times have I said. \"Sure we can do that, no that doesn't bother me, that sounds like a good idea, whatever you want to do I don't mind.\" Too many times have I wasted my time on people which have only led to disappointment. 10 times to keep story going, 10 times I've only lost more interest, 10 times I made sure to incorporate what my partner[s] enjoy..\n\nI use roleplay as a way to manage my anxiety and escape. I have horrible depression and I can't do the only thing I love. Instead I shut myself off, then I'm encouraged to open up or talk OOC more, I cave in and think this person could be different, then they know the real me they see a glimpse of the person behind the screen. It all goes to hell. I try to incorporate OOC to allow a breather for the mind, not every can stay in character long and I always try to be as understanding or open minded as possible. But as soon as something happens the other person doesn't like, instead of communicating and explaining how that upsets them or makes them feel uncomfortable...I get blocked and dropped like I was never worth the time of day. And that is what makes me hate writing now.\n\nEverything seems fine, I am quick to my responses and I even encourage help in case others dont understand..we have fun and then something happens and I just...I get ghosted and dropped like I never even meant anything or spoke to the person. It hurts and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting my time I to something or someone and being treated like it doesn't mean shit...",

Me personally, I don't see the problem with topping, but I'm a switch, and it's like it's so hard to get my fix dude. It's kinda disheartening and sucks the joy out of roleplay for me. \n\nOne experience I had, a friend of mine, the first three years we knew each other, completely refused with all she had to top, even though I don't get as much enjoyment from it. One day, she suddenly turned around and said she liked doing it (being dom) and wanted to do it, but I already have anxiety so that wasn't, and hasn't been setting too well for me. I have a problem asking other people to be the sub now.. And roleplay is becoming more of a \"see how long you can last\" Challenge for me..",
