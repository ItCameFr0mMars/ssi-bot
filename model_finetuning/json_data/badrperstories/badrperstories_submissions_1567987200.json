I hope you soak your shield and sock in a deep puddle.] I picked up this person August 12th or so, I've been patient, I've tried to work with their schedule, I nudged for story progress and roleplay here and there after so many days of waiting. Instead of telling me the truth and saying their muse hasn't been good, or they didn't even want to write to begin with. They kept me thinking for a MONTH. I would be able to write with them. \"I'll get you a post in, I promise I'm not ghosting you.\" Shove it.\n\nSo now finally after literally a full month of being led along and screwed over. They finally drop me and remove me like I knew they would. I wasted my time, I was treated disrespectfully, I was placed in a very anxious position. I gave them all the time in the world and I waited by my phone daily for a message. This lousy excuse of a writing partner played me like a violin and I'm sick of it.\n\nIf YOU plan to write with someone, if YOU plan to waste their time, if YOU plan to use excuse after excuse, if YOU plot story and make plans. STICK WITH THEM. Screw you, screw people like you, screw this entire system of ghosting and being dropped, I'm done. I'm fed up and I dont plan to try finding partners anymore. If YOU message me or we get in touch to discuss roleplay and writing. Do not be such a selfish prick and treat my time like some joke. I'm not here to flip backwards trying to entertain you and keep you interested, I'm sick and tired of giving a damn when nobody else at all seems to.",

            "selftext": "I started roleplaying on a certain platform, and I noticed some people are *obsessed* with real-life face-claims. Some people will make OCs based on people they find attractive, creating characters that have little to offer other than being hot. A lot of people demand RL FC -- or rather, *attractive* Rl FCs -- and effectively thirst for the *FC,* caring little about the character behind it. \n\nA lot of my OCs have detailed drawn references or written descriptions. I like showing their actual design, and I don't think a random picture would be equally accurate. That ended up being a *huge* problem, and it's incredible how many people suggested realistic face claims are an indicator of quality. Mind you, some of those people fit the sub's description pretty well; the only difference is their OC is usurping a pretty model's face. \n\n Someone recently suggested looking for realistic Face Claims for my muses. I accepted, even if I thought it was unnecessary. They ended up suggesting people who looked *nothing* like my characters, insisting they were 'hotter' and 'better.' They had a different eye color, body type, hair, and one even changed race... it was pretty clear they simply wanted me to play someone they found attractive.  \n\nI have no issue with face-claims, but this excessively superficial attitude saddens me a little. I don't care about how my partner represents their muse so long as they are comfortable with it. I know one of my main RP partners had the opposite problem: people would go after her OCs *only* because of the face-claim, showing no interest in the rest.",

            "selftext": "First time, long time lurker here.\n\nHello and I would like to apologize about English not being my first language, just in advance.\n\nThis may be a long read- but I will try to squeeze in everything. And maybe because I wanted to use this place as a vent away. \n\nI've been roleplaying for over a decade right now. I had a share of bad and good roleplayers, until, I met one of my long-time roleplaying partners (and who I have decided to date, which was a big mistake to begin with). We roleplayed for 2 years and a half. Only to realize that I have lost my passion in roleplaying and I start to feel very anxious each time I try to go back to it.\n\nLet me by begin saying that I do have a very low self-esteem and I usually tend to be a people's pleaser so this only ends up being taken as an advantage of. But I realize that this is my personality's weakness ( :( ). \n\nAnd my biggest pet peeve is that he would not listen to me. He didn't respect me as a roleplaying partner.  He didn't even listen to me voicing my opinion or what I want, what are my desires and what do I enjoy. \n\nWe used to have trillions of characters and ships.  At first it was fun, but I started to realize that some of them have become more and more of a chore, completely aimless and most of the time a lot of them would spend a lot of the time in the \"bed\" instead of doing anything story-wise. I am more story oriented. I need something interesting to keep my blood pumping and flowing.  And yes, I did later end up complaining to him about that and expressed my feelings- only for the things to cease down for 2 weeks until he started forcing the smut all over again down my throat.\n\nI started to lose a lot of voice for certain characters and I wanted to put them on hold/on hiatus for the time being until I can regain it or at least miss them and figure out something else what I want to do with them. He didn't understand what I was trying to come across. I even told him that I would appreciate it if we stopped adding new characters for the time being, only for me to wake up and him suggest that maybe we should add. Or at once he had suggested to me to add 32 more characters.. I didn't even have a remote interest in playing and even expressed that opinion so many times. I even said that I don't even have any ideas for them.\n\nBut my biggest pet peeve is how he would not even read my replies or at least that's how I felt like. Or maybe he would read them, but he would end up changing the outcome in my replies. During my very first replies, I would try to introduce my characters, their personalities and their interests, even what they are doing to give them some sort of a backbone - not just a \"play-by\" or to be used for a smut. Only for him to change some of their traits in the midway.Once, even I was working on one of my replies, I  wrote him a long paragraph saying that this is not how I i intended my character to be and he should re-read one of my replies if he had forgotten. This is when I was starting to become tired because I noticed this is starting to become a pattern.\n\nExcept, this pattern would appear during our discussions, and he would say that \"I don't see this character that way, I'd say this is more your other character\" and \"this is weird, from the way you write your character I would not think of them that way\" - you know, the gaslighting or godmodding.\n\nBut for me the most heartbreaking thing was when I spent days on building one of my characters up and he was one of my originals from the beginning I started roleplaying with and I wanted to bring the character for him to roleplay with.  This original character comes from one of the supernatural TV series, it is based off of there although he's an original character. For his origins only to be changed tremendously to fit in his \"narrative\". Apparently, that show didn't write witches correctly according to him and he didn't like the series.\n\nI told him that while I do agree that the series are not the best, that's where my character originates from whether he likes it or not and that I have been writing my character like this for months with him until he decides to throw a hissy fit and start changing his origins all out of nowhere because he doesn't understand \"witches\" as a concept (and he truly does not, I tried explainnig to him his character and where does his powers inherit from). When I told him that, he just gave me a half-assed \"I am glad that we both can come to terms and you agree with me\". \n\nAs I continued to rp, I decided that I started to feel second question myself and my choices, if my replies are alright, what if my characters are not doing good enough, and I would dread on working my replies for him that sometimes I would not just be able to do them. I was feeling zero excitement.  I realized that this has become like a work that doesn't even pay me.\n\nAll the anxiety that follows me even today. I lost all the passion I've had for roleplaying. I tried coming back  to it a couple of the times only to end up riled up with the anxiety and fears all out of nowhere.  The one thing that always kept me calm and happy now riles me up with the anger and pain. It was my escape from a reality and stress. But now I feel like I grew to despise it. \n\nAnd I know that there are a lot of wonderful people out there. \n\nHe tried reaching out to me for a few months after we stopped roleplaying and he told me a couple of times he misses us doing roleplays but I told him that I was no longer ineterested. He stopped after 7th month or so because he most likely must have realized that I truly have no interest in writing with him anymore. \n\nI honestly don't wish anyone to have an encounter with him or a person like him .Roleplaying should be fun and you should have fun developing your characters and building up the universe around him. It should be an amazing experience that doesn't take your energy away or makes you feel bad about yourself.",
