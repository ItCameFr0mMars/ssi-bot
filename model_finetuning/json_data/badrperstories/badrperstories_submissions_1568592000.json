            "selftext": "I'm new here, so first of all, hello.  I've been role-playing for fifteen years, I've seen a lot of really crappy role plays and been the crappy role player too.\n\nI'd like to put this entire rant into context before getting into it: I DON'T ROLE PLAY ONLINE ANYMORE. It's for personal and time management reasons, and I don't like to be leashed to electronics. I meet with some friends on weekends to play D&amp;D, and that's just about all the role playing I will do and truly enjoy at this point.\n\nToday I'm just so annoyed with a friend who... Ugh how do I put this. She can't have a discussion about characters without turning it into a roleplay. Under normal circumstances it might be just an expression of excitement about the characters and it's fun to speculate how they'd react to different situations, and I wouldn't really mind this if it weren't for her character, we'll call her T, who is always in a bad place. \n\nI apologize if my explanations are a bit nebulous and compromised of scattered thoughts and emotions. T is just un-eefing-bearable because Friend really really seems to enjoy keeping T in a state of any of the following: Being beaten up, Suffering a raging terminal medical issue, a nervous breakdown, miserable because my characters are not paying a very specific kind of attention to her, assuming my characters or the world in general hate her (tbh if my characters seem cold it's because I personally hate T but this started long before I explicitly disliked T), constant self loathing, martyrdom, incapable of any happiness (literally one of her key character traits verbatim \"never cracks a smile\"), the history of sexual abuse pops up a lot more than I'm comfortable with, T constantly compares herself to my character with this kind of longing jealously and self loathing that I find ESPECIALLY CAUSTIC because it constantly worms its way into the narrative, cannot have any positive emotion without immediately deprecating herself against some sort of idealism focused at my character... Just......... T is always in pain and sad. Frankly, she makes me sad. I can't read anything Friend spitballs about T without being miserably sad. \n\nI write drama fiction in my spare time, I'm unpublished, but I'm aware that you need the characters to experience a wide range of emotions or else they fall flat. You need to treat things as an up and down cycle, with good events and bad events and resolutions. Friend is deeply in love with the suffering of T and actively creates unnecessary roadblocks in the way of resolution. I not saying resolution should come EASILY, but it should not be designed to be impossible, which Friend does consistently.\n\nI find myself having zero interest in responding to her Sad Narrative ideas because it a) makes me sad and b) Friend is not great at taking criticism. I try to avoid pointing out harmful or reoccurring upsetting narrative because Friend will start to self depreciate on her writing (spoiler, she writes drama too and is excellent at it, I actually LIKE T in her written story quite a lot, I just hate her Ketchup flavor next to my mashed potatoes if you catch my drift, she's perfect in her story like ketchup is perfect on a hot dog.)\n\nHere's another instance where I got super uncomfortable. We were generally discussing a What If scenario. Friend is so focused on keeping T miserable and unloved (THE UNLOVED NARRATIVE UGHUGHUGH) that she hypothesized that a side character of mine, an older man we'll call A, would be perplexed and disappointed at his friend who we'll call B (another supporting character of mine) for taking in T as a successor due to T's physical flaws. It just kinda irked and I guess even hurt me a bit that she'd assessed A's personal opinions in this way while knowing he's taken in a bunch of problem kids with a wide range of their own personal difficulties and flaws with the sole goal of getting everyone to adulthood in one piece. Just... I did point this one out, by that I mean clarified that A would absolutely not regard T this way, because I was pretty offended on A's behalf that she pulled him out of character in order to make T unlovable(TM) again...\n\nUgh... Idk. I'm losing steam writing this vent here. When I think about it I feel like a jerk. I know a lot of T's really unlikable traits come from Friend having a lot of self doubt, so it's hard to separate critique of T from Friend's personal life. I really care about Friend, I absolutely understand where these feelings come from, but it's really difficult to hear a character and a writer self depreciate so much and no matter how much I try to boost her up and reassure her she still compares my characters and ME to herself and its complicated and she constantly calls herself and her characters garbage.... It's frustrating when you constantly hear that comparison, and can't convince someone they're good, and then more comparison. It kinda just hurts.",

            "selftext": "Dear Spineless Jerk.\n\nHello, Hi, Bonjour, Hellur! Don't send your friend to harrass me and try to blame me for YOUR problems and mistakes. Allow me to make this clear. This is the explanation of the worse partner I've ever had. [Apparently his friend saw my last post so I hope another friend of his sees this one.]\n\nIf you decide to speak to a person, engage in a story and ask if they would like to roleplay. Be sure you have respect for their time and don't treat them like crap. He may feel like I somehow am at fault for how HE treated ME. To those which will read this be ready for a TL;DR post. If this doesn't interest you please don't bother reading any further. If you are interested and want to hear very valid reasons continue on.\n\nReason 1: I waited an entire month for only a little bit of interaction which was more than unsatisfactory. I was given; excuse, after excuse, after excuse, after excuse, after excuse, after excuse. And when he decided to interact with me I was accepting and I took what was given to me even if it meant very little and didnt make up for his lack of respect.\n\nReason 2: I gave him days, weeks, a month even. Anytime he sent in a 'reply' I would respond instantly and wait another four or five days for one post. He liked to talk OOC yet he wouldn't put effort in the story. I was seeking roleplay as a way to help my anxiety, I use writing as a way to balance myself and steady my anxiety and stress. I've had my share of people ghost me and what he did was ghosting.\n\nReason 3: He should have put more effort in. I dont know what else I could have possibly done. He gave me a crappy excuse I accepted it and encouraged him to move on. I waited and waited for him to interact with me properly but he lacked common respect and effort. He didn't even fight his own fight instead he sent a friend to tell me I was wrong. His friend insulted me, went one how I was the reason said person didnt want to write, said I was the problem, he even called me a sociopath [actually admired he knew the proper word, though I'm just fed up with being ghosted] This guy knew I used rp as a way to feel better. If he didnt want to write in the first place he should have said so and we could have avoided all of this.\n\nReason 4: A few of the excuses made were a dead give away he had no interest, I only snapped after I realized he didnt give a shit about my time nor my interests. He made bullshit lies and I shown him nothing but patience and kindness. I encouraged him for one little post after having enough of being put off, I took what he gave even if it was more stressful. He is by far one of the worse people I've ever tried to write with. He didn't stop and consider that instead of being a selfish jerk he should learn to respect people's time and hold his word. What excuses were made? Well that brings me to my final reason.\n\nReason 5: The following actions and examples are worded a certain way out of respect, but the accounts are actually what happened. The following; spent two hours organizing a DVD collection instead of getting around to posting one response after saying they will, they were in the middle of a move which I understood and often asked if that had free time they would say yes but leave me on read waiting for a response, we planned story and had this big set up when I asked for progress they would say sure but once more not send in progress, they often had family matters which I dropped any interest in story for that day as he took care of it, I would send one message and ask how he was nothing in return I tried making effort in communication he did not, when we started to write and got around to posting only two posts were exchanged in the matter of 20minutes then nothing for five days, he would say \"I'll work on getting you a post in tonight.\" To which I got excited and waited only to be lied to and ghosted, and finally the cherry on the cake. He had the nerve to rant and complain about his problems and anxiety expecting sympathy and comfort, which I provided to him. I tried to help him feel better. But when I asked for story progress he denied me if my comfort and way to relax...so if he sees this post, of his friends see this post, stay the hell away from my inbox and dont message me ever again.",

You should start from the \\[beginning.\\]( [https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/at6wmy/hello\\_there\\_i\\_am\\_seargent\\_staff\\_general\\_marine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/at6wmy/hello_there_i_am_seargent_staff_general_marine/) )  \n\n\nNow this is going to be a long post with quite a few quotes. Karnie began to follow the trail of the robbers and meets the Warhammer 40k dreadnought, Pyrax. They find the robbers' truck is on fire and it's very clear that they had switched rides. He talks to Pyrax for a moment before automatically detecting an oil trail from the second truck.\n\nSo, Karnie and Pyrax go onward to talk to these criminals, who turn out to be a highly armed and trained revolutionary group, the NSPM. The NSPM are holed up in an abandoned stadium, where they had managed to setup heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, AT guns, and tank destroyers (TDs) to stop any would-be invaders. They had also setup an extensive minefield with manual detonators, making for an almost impenetrable defense.\n\nThis means that Karnie should try to bargain with them, right?\n\nhaha\n\n&gt;*Karnie: \"I arrive at the truck's location far earlier than the Dreadnought, so I take cover behind a wall, setting my HUD to combat mode. I load in a mag of HEAT rounds, and go prone, taking aim at the tank destroyers, then fire, eliminating them\"*\n\nKarnie's SCAR-L (still chambered in 7.62x51, of course) manages to auto-hit these TDs instantly somehow. I decided not to give in and have the TDs remain operational, because HEAT rounds can only poke small holes through armor. The NSPM simply changed out the crew if they were injured.\n\n&gt;*Karnie: \" I dash out of my hiding space, then unload my HEAT rounds into the Tank Destroyers, destroying them. I continue to dodge gunfire, dashing from cover to cover, loading in a new mag, firing, dropping bodies, reloading, dropping more bodies*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I run out of SCAR ammo, then I grit my teeth. I retreat outside\"*\n\nThis is the point where I began to use the minefield, blowing Karnie's position away. \n\n&gt;*Karnie: \"outside, I grimace, setting down a cylinder to heal my wounds, and I watch the Dreadnought lumber up the street. I glare at it behind my helmet, my bleeding wounds slowly healing* Took your sweet time, Big Guy. can you finish them off for me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(my dude, what part of OUTSIDE do you not get)\"\n\nApparently he thought that people can operate minefields **INSIDE OF A GOD-DAMNED BUILDING**, but I digress. Pyrax meets up with Karnie and they get greeted by the NSPM's charismatic leader via PA system. Now, I intended the NSPM to be a final boss of sorts. Karnie, well, he wanted to beat him on day 1. After a bunch of arguing, Karnie accusing the NSPM of robbing the shop, the NSPM accusing him of almost killing a kid (which was true), Pyrax suggests a cease-fire. How does Karnie respond?  \n\n\n*haha*\n\n \n\n&gt;Karnie: \"*I close my eyes, and four dozen Balls of Condensed Sunlight flare to life around me. I send them out, each one locked a different hostile* *B.C.M still off* maybe. but only for a bit *I activate the Orbs, and each one fires a beam of pure heat, vaporizing 4 dozen hostiles instantly*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I hate using Solenmancy, it really drains me  \n&gt;  \n&gt;but desperate times, you know?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*quickly summons 6 more Orbs, and they Condense into a hardened barrier around Pyrex and myself*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Condenses more Sunlight to Reinforce the Barrier, my whole focus to keep it active* Big Guy! I'm focused on Defense! you're my Offense!\"\n\nFucking sunlight magic, man. I ignore the **IMPENETRABLE** solar shield, much to his displeasure.\n\n&gt;Karnie: \"(DUDE! BARRIER! READ THE RP!)   \n&gt;  \n&gt;(OH YOU ARE SO FUCKED NOW)  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *the explosion's impact on my armor, while not dealing any damage, forces me backwards, sending me flying out of sight, my barrier dropping, exposing the Dreadnought* \"\n\nKarnie can't get injured, only flung away from the battle zone. Pyrax, however, gets immobilized by several concentrated missile strikes. The NSPM ceases fire and they strike a deal to repair Pyrax's armor.  \n\n\n&gt;Karnie: \"(I could fix this with a Rewind Tube)\"\n\nWelp.\n\nUp next: Karnie gets creepy with the girls.",
