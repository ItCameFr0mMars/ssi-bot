            "selftext": "I have been involved in an RP set in the alternative universe of a popular anime for about a little over a year now, and while it has been an enjoyable time, the head DMs has always left a bad taste in my mouth. From the get-go he always left a bad taste in my mouth. One example I can think of is when I first joined the server and was getting my character set up, I didn't quite understand a mechanic so I asked how it works and he asked me to explain how I thought it worked, his response to my question was \"Why would you think it works that way? That doesn't even make sense lol.\" Should have been a red flag right from the start, but I liked the people in the server, so I wasn't about to let one bad apple ruin it for me. There were a few other instances like this of the head DM being condescending, but nothing really of note.   \n\n\nWhat this post about is a more recent issue. The server held an event where our characters were grouped up in order to have to run through a gauntlet sort of challenge. Everything is going well until all of a sudden, a message is sent into the room basically telling someone that they've been using their power all wrong and their character is basically drained now. The person messaged the head DM and basically got the same \"Why would you think it works that way?\" response, which is hilarious since he's the one who makes all the tweaks to powers before they're approved, it was his bad wording that made the person think it worked the way it did. So, whatever, the event carries on for a week or so and then suddenly we are told by our group DM we're going to pause. We aren't told why we were paused, and when I messaged by the group DM and head DM, they both told me it wasn't my concern why the group was stopped. I can understand why DMs would want to keep some things a secret but having been DMing myself in various groups for about 12 years now, I think your players deserve a little bit of transparency. And now we get to where we are now, my group being on pause for 2 weeks while everyone else is still going.",

            "selftext": "This is something I thought would help people. I\u2019ve had the incredible bad luck to come across some very toxic and manipulative people in the art of roleplay. They\u2019re people who think of you as something they can just drop the moment you hold no interest to them or decide to play victim. Very recently I got gripped by a very toxic partner indeed who is now happily spreading stuff around on different subreddits about how she is proud she ghosted me and that I\u2019m just some person on the internet and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s begin shall we?\n\n\n1: the \u2018any\u2019 rper:\n\n\nEver come across someone who says that they\u2019ll do absolutely anything you want? Those seemingly enthusiastic people who agree to do whatever type of rp you are looking for then immediately complain about how much they hate it or lack the knowledge to properly rp that type of roleplay? Well these rpers are people who don\u2019t actually want to do anything but hope by saying that they do that they\u2019ll find exactly what they want. These rpers tend to say yes to absolutely everything and promise absolutely everything under the sun to you but in the end give you poor quality. While not all any rper\u2019s like this (I\u2019ve met at least a handful who actually did have knowledge of the style of rp I liked and were truthful in what they could and couldn\u2019t do) a majority of them are. If you do decide to take a chance on someone who claims to be an any rper do so at your own risk and don\u2019t be too disappointed if you end up not getting what you thought you would.\n\n\n2: the \u2018adaptable\u2019 rper:\n\n\n\u201cOh, I normally only do fantasy rp\u2019s but I can most certainly adapt to a apocalyptic rp.\u201d Adaptable rpers are a bit like any rper\u2019s in that they don\u2019t have much knowledge of the type of rp you may be looking to do but will promise you that they can do it. The difference between them and any rper\u2019s is that they tend to ignore people until they realise they\u2019re not finding the kind of rp they want and then decide that they\u2019ll do a different kind of rp in the hopes they get one. This is seen as very desperate and often ends with arguments as the adaptable rper turns out to be not as adaptable as they advertise. Again not all adaptable rper\u2019s are like this but a good majority of them are, if you see someone who has completely ignored you has suddenly messaged you saying they can adapt to do your rp chances are you\u2019re not going to get it.\n\n\n3: the manipulator:\n\n\n\u201cI want this in the rp, don\u2019t give it to me and I\u2019ll leave. \u201c this is something no rper wants to here. Manipulators are one of the nastier people to encounter in the world of role play and often present themselves as charming, friendly people who may make character action suggestions or certain plots here and there to you before it progresses into threats to leave or even controlling your character without your permission. Due to the fact that there\u2019s no real way to tell between someone who is like this from the start you can get a nasty surprise. The main rule of thumb here is if your partner is frequently suggesting stuff for your character to do in a passive aggressive way after being friendly then its best to leave. These people will say stuff to try and make you stay but it\u2019s just lies that they will not follow through with.\n\n4: the toxic controller:\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re character isn\u2019t paying any attention to mine so I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d Is a very poor excuse to take control of another person\u2019s character. People like this tend to over plot and over think situations for the characters and will nit pick you to make themselves seem in control. They will take over your characters and expect you to do absolutely everything they say and not question them. The moment you do they will play the victim to make you feel horrible. This was the type of rper I myself encountered a few days ago due to her creating a copy of tony stark and trying to force a romance plot down my throat. When I was taking my sweet time getting my characters to interact with hers or tried to be a side character she\u2019d go off at me claiming that side characters shouldn\u2019t get much attention yet we\u2019re still somewhat detrimental to the story. She claimed the fact my characters were premade made her feel uncomfortable for some weird reason and that she could not rp with me. She said this for three days straight over and over again before I finally snapped and she left. These people will always try to make you look like the bad guy. Even if you\u2019re enjoying the story you\u2019ve come up with if the person you are rping with gets upset about things like that and treats you like garbage for it do yourself a favour and leave them.\n\n\n5: \u201cI want this but I don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to rp with your human character but your alien looks like a furry.\u201d \u201cI want a slow burn romance but I don\u2019t want them to be friends for very long.\u201d Yep, these are downright Ridiculous but true things I\u2019ve come across. These rpers are very very picky and when offered with one thing they turn it down and demand another. If you\u2019re lucky to even actually start and rp with these kinds of people you probably won\u2019t get very far.\n\n\nThere you have it folks. Why did I pick these five and these five only? Because they\u2019re the ones you gotta look out for the most. Also, the list of bad types of rpers is endless so I probably would\u2019ve been writing to post up till I died if I went to incorporate every single bad rper out there. Do feel free to give your opinion on this and even share your own but please remain civil about it and note how I say not everyone is like the rpers I have come across.",

I've had a number of people who I thought were good friends with me just block me completely out of the blue.

So I have a nice roleplaying partner who I just adore OOC, she's funny, considerate, has GREAT ideas. \n\nThe problem is... Her writing. \n\nFor the longest time I couldn't figure out what exactly is wrong with her writing but I just recently figured it out when I started to write with more experienced roleplayers (my friend has been roleplaying for about 7 months now). \n\nMy friend doesn't write like a roleplayer, she writes like she's writing a novel. There's a couple of key issues with her style that just make a writing with her exhausting.\n\nFirst, she spends soooo much time describing how her characters feel about things: my characters, the environment, memories, everything. Her writing is also littered with similes like: \"it was as if \\[insert weird metaphor here\\]\" or \"The evening felt like a \\[strange simile here\\]\"\n\nIt's not purple. It's hard to describe. Sometimes her writing could actually use some purplishness. It's very sharp, very to the point. \n\nSecond, because she writes like she's writing a novel, her characters tend to ALWAYS steal the spotlight. Every single time.\n\nI've actually mentioned the second issue and she has promised to tone it down, it just... hasn't happened. Her characters have an insanely strong presence and they naturally get steered under the spotlight. They would make excellent novel characters but they're not fun to roleplay with. At some point, I can't help but feel unsatisfied because my characters never seem to get as much attention as hers do.\n\nEven if the plot was about someone else, her characters end up being much more important than originally intended because she likes to move the action forward and she likes to describe how the situation affects her characters.",

Meaning I am more focused on the plot, lore and storytelling aspect of the game rather than the actual character interactions themselves.\n\nOf course, my circle is filled with like-minded people with a similar writing style to my own. So we all have grand plans for the story and world of our game.\n\nHowever, there comes much tedious planning and brainstorming in order for a cohesive, fluid narrative to be pulled off. Every player has their own stakes in the plot and have their own plans for what they want to do with their characters. Some are just as much ambitious as my own. \nAnd that's the problem.\n\nSee, I want to be a nice GM and give all the players the opportunities to see their own plans come to fruition. However, I do not want to do this at the expense of my own plans, as some players' plans interfere with my own.\n\nI could reveal to them what I want/plan to do, but that would ruin the surprise and shock value of the in-game reveal. Plus it could risk my RP being metagame with the OOC knowledge of what is coming.\n\nSo, what is one to do in this case, and could you share your own personal experience regarding this matter?",

I honestly dont even know why Im part of it, to be perfectly honest. I never say anything because my opinions are very different and would probably get me literally silenced or banned.\n\n\nI remember one time I was reading what they were saying, and they implied that anyone who liked to rp highschool au's were pedophiles. \n\n\nThe whole group just screams tumblr.",

Weird how that work out, right?\n\n2. They use a lot of emojis, lol, haha, and excessive !!!!. These people are immature assholes in disguise, plain and simple. Cut off immediately. \n\n3. They don't read your ideas thoroughly and rush. You can tell this because of how they misunderstood something you wrote so clearly.\n\n4. They keep swerving off topic and asking you weird questions about your life. Buddy, this isn't an irl dating arrangement.\n\n5. They act like the character you are playing is your self-insert. Instead of saying I want your character to be .......... they say I want you to be...... Major red flag.\n\n6. They are too impatient. You haven't replied to them in 2 minutes and they write \"hello, are you there?\" Well not any more you are not because you will stopped the rp immediately. \n\n7. They keep complimenting you on every idea you gave and I mean the empty kind of compliment. \"Wow that's so cool you are so creative!\" \"I love that!\" Over and over. Drop the rp immediately. Major red flag.\n\n8. They don't add anything to the world building or help bounce off the conversation. I.e you're doing everything. Try to ask them what they think of this and that, but if they still give boring replies then drop immediately- not worth your time. \n\nThrough filtering out the many bad ones upon first meet, I managed to find the good rpers faster.
