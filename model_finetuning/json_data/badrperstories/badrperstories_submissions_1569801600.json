            "selftext": "Warning: this story includes mentions of suicide and selfharm\n\nWhen I wrote some of my first RPs (i was about 16, maybe 17 at that time), a search for a fantasystory caught my eye, and I wrote the person who wrote it. They quickly agreed to RP with me, and seemed like a good writer, despite their character being a little bit depressed. But oh well, it was a dark setting, so I did not mind at all. While talking to them, he then told me his name, his gender and his age, which was 28 if I remember correctly, and I did the same. So he definitely knew how old I was.\n\nAfter having written the RP for about 2 days (it was around christmas), he suddenly wrote me that he was suicidal, that he had recently cut his wrists, and the only one who could safe him from doing this again was...me. I should agree to call him. I was young and a bit stupid at the time, and I panicked, so I agreed. But I called him with a suppressed telefon number.\n\nHe told me how depressed he was, that he wanted to kill himself, and I listened to him. But suddenly, the conversation became weirder. He began telling me that the main reason for his depression was that he had not been able to find a woman to marry and have children with. I tried to be nice, but that struck me as a little bit weird, and made me more uncomfortable.\n\nWell, rightly so. In the conversation, it turned out that he wanted ME to be this woman. He told me that he could feel that we are soulmates, I should come visit him as soon possible and that he believes it will work out, how he has a good job in IT and how I never would have to work in my entire life if I did not want to. Always emphasizing that he was suicidal and that he might kill himself if he did not get what he wanted (a woman and children of his own) soon. I made up some bullshit excuse to leave the call.\n\nAfter that, I talked to my dad about it. My father said I should not panic, that this person was just manipulative and I should stop writing with them. I wrote my RP partner a short message about how I do not think that this would work out, and he simply replied with something like 'Ok.'\n\nHe never contacted me again or tried to ask what was wrong, which I found a little bit odd, because of his behavior before. But I was relieved by this. A little bit later, I would find out why. The RP site on which we both wrote had something similiar to a guestbook function, where people could leave greetings. I never paid any attention to this, so I had not read his before. And his guestbook was full of weird messages from different girls. Many of them seemed to be confused that he 'wrote with other girls' or 'why we never write anymore, I thought we had a connection'. I believe that he pulled the 'I am so suicidal, please call me, we are soulmates' card with every RP partner he had, and then ditched the girls immediatly if they wrote something he did not like.\n\nOne year after this happened, he was still online frequently, so it is safe to say that he did not kill himself because I stopped writing to him. Truly one of the most uncomfortable RP experiences I ever had.",

            "selftext": "Hi.\n\nSo, I'm keen on playing female characters and my long-term (5y+) partner is completely OK with that. That's not the issue, though. They enjoy certain types of characters, I enjoy certain types of characters. However, lately it's been seeming as if they drop interest if my characters deviate from the expected. As such, we've shifted through at least like 6 different plot ideas/roleplays because my characters are \"not enthusiastic\" or have \"a depressing reason to be in a certain place\". It's annoying because I spend time carefully crafting these characters and setting them goals so they can get out of the depressing situations they're in and hopefully better themselves and those around them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my partner is not a bad writer at all, and always has creative ideas, but some just don't appeal to me. However, smut isn't excluded and ***if*** it gets to smut, their responses are quick and they're very interested in the RP out of a sudden? Regardless of how \"depressing\" and \"boring\" my characters may seem to be. If I even hint at something like that being a possibility, they're all over it. I noticed this being a pattern a few months back and I've started playing asexual characters more often simply because I found the attempts at smut just pure unadulterated cringe, boring roleplay and really just un-neccessary to keep an otherwise interesting story going.\n\nI've also developed my skills over time, so when I drop a post that is more detailed and longer, it's really discouraging to get 2 lazy paragraphs as a reply with nothing for my character to work with except nod her head and move on after saying \"ok cool\", you know? It's discouraging and I'm not really sure how to deal with this.\n\nOf course, all the overly annoying questions I get about my characters don't help, either.\n\nIs she thicc? What are her measurements?\n\n*I don't care. I want to portray a realistic character, leave her lady bits out of this for the love of God.* I enjoy roleplaying with my partner, but lately they've been getting more and more unsubstantial, undeveloped smut-oriented or otherwise they take forever to reply or give just... lackluster replies.\n\nAs much as I enjoy playing asexual characters, it's really hard to play a character with any other sexual orientation with my partner simply because I know that they just want to engage in smut with my character(s), though I personally wouldn't mind it if it had any backing to it, it's just... no.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nPost scriptum: Yes, this is a throwaway.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so this first one comes from a rather popular Mass Effect community on Discord. There were a few great people on there, but man, a lot of the admins were baaaad. I have a few horror stories from that place, and here's one.\n\nSo, this server was comprised of two servers: the training server, and the main server. That's stupid enough, but it's neither here nor there - just a bit of context so you can understand what I'm talking about going forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI and two others, P and O, were part of the tenth training class, and we were all pretty tight, with each other as well as the others in the class. Great group overall tbh. But there was a problem: the admins had taken a dislike to O. Not for any real, objectively punishable reason, I don't think - they just didn't like him as a person. Which is fine; as an admin, it doesn't matter if you like someone or not, as long as you treat them fairly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut these guys didn't. Oh no. So, as soon as the class was over and those who'd graduated (yes, you had to graduate from the training server before you were allowed to join the main RP) had added their chars to the main server, the admins began a witch hunt against O, and being that P and O were especially tight, they decided to blackmail P into scrounging up dirt on O so they could have a reason to ban him. Of course, P had no choice but to comply or (presumably) be banned, so he did. This wound up destroying P and O's friendship in a spectacular fashion, and they never reconciled afaik.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's right - the admins of this server destroyed an entire friendship because they didn't like someone and were looking for a reason to ban them.",
