            "selftext": "Once, I was looking for an rp partner. It was a pretty open search. The only things it should include was knights and a medieval setting. Soon, a guy wrote me that he is interested. We exchanged some messages. But he would never add anything to my plans, his only answers consisted of 'hm', 'ok', 'if you want'. If I ask him 'what character type do you want to play?', he would answer 'don't know'. After he wrote seven messages similiar to those mentioned above, I had enough, I told him 'Hey, if you are not interested in the setting and don't want to rp anymore, just say so. These short answers are annoying.' \n\nHe wrote back that he only wrote such short answers because he was at work at the moment. In the evening, he would share all his great plans for the medieval fantasy setting with knight with me. Okay. He did not write anything in the evening. The next morning, I ask him 'So what are your plans?'\n\nThis time, he replied with a somewhat longer message... 'Hm...how about we write an rp with a modern setting instead, and our characters are serial killers?' I never wrote back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother time, I searched for an RP with characters that are children, similiar to stuff like stranger things or the first books of Harry Potter. I made it absolutely clear that there should be no sexual themes at all (because the characters are children), and romance only if it is age appropriate (so maybe a childhood crush, but not marriage or staying together forever). The focus was on the adventure. \n\nA girl messaged me, and while exchanging messages, I noticed that she obviously had not really read my search. For example, she wanted our characters to be 20. I replied that she should please read my search again. She said oh, it is okay, some characters can be younger and some can be 17, and I saw nothing wrong with that. So while we created our characters, I asked her if there was any character types she wanted me to play...and she wanted me to play two girls, for a lesbian love triangle. She wrote me a lengthy message about how my characters should fight about her female character, and how great that would be. I searched for her own searches, and it was all super nsfw stuff.\n\nAfter that, I told her that this was not working out. Is it really so hard to read searches and only answer if the topic is something that really interests you? I had so many encounters similiar to these two. It is frustrating as hell.",

            "selftext": "So I started this rp about two months ago. It was going quite well for the first couple of weeks. The person I was rping with it prefers to write longer posts (my usual style is literate but more like a few sentences to a short paragraph or two at most per post depending on the situation), but I don't mind it and sort of just accepted it as a challenge as I have not rped in a long time before this. I was pretty excited about some of the planning we did and then... She stopped replying.\n\nI admittedly got a little anxious thinking that my previous post maybe wasn't long enough (it was about an average paragraph, but our exchanges have been significantly longer) so after a week with no reply, I edited it and sent her a message apologizing if my post was lackluster and just explained that it had been a while since I last rped and that I was not used to writing posts that long. This was how it went:\n\nMe:  I noticed my last reply was kinda lackluster so I edited it (it looked longer in the app, but I noticed it was very short when I looked at it on discord in my browser). I apologize, I'm honestly not used to writing posts this long. I can do it and don't mind it, I'm just not quite used to it so it takes me a while \\^\\^\" \n\nHer: That's okay hun. Sorry I've been quit. We're moving so it's been crazy here. I have to get a 3.5k down payment so I've been working alot. @\\_@ Then my brain is too stupid to write ahaha! If it's better we can set up a day to RP and we can just write short back and forth for longer?\n\nMe:  No worries about not replying in a while, I understand real life stuff comes first! I just got a little anxious cause I\u2019ve been in a few rps before where if I didn\u2019t write a long enough reply sometimes others would get frustrated. I mean I understand being frustrated with constant one-liners but there was a group in particular I used to rp in that had ridiculously long minimum word limits and people would get upset even if you were a hair short of the word count so I ended up leaving it, so yeahhh \\^\\^\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyways I just kinda explained where my anxiety about my posts came from, but she didn't reply after that and its been exactly a month. But I see her online on discord a lot so... She's probably not interested anymore? Should I message just to check on her to see if she's okay and ask her if she still wants to continue the rp or should I not bother? Like I said in my reply I understand her situation but I feel she should have at least acknowledged my message or something by now?  Any advice would be appreciated.",

            "selftext": "So, this story is less bad and more fustrating, so very much so a rant type of thing. I was playing some WoW, Alliance side ans came across a Lightforged Eredar. To anyone in the know, the Eredar are split between those who still carry the name and are Demons and those who chose to oppose the Demons, the Draenei, of which I was playing.\n\nWhy they chose to specify being an Eredar rather than a Draenei, along with ignoring the realistic deal of being considered an enemy by association I don\u2019t know...and i considered just not rping with them since I didn\u2019t much care for pushing the envelope on what you play as...but that made me think of myself as an rp elitist and decided to swallow my pride and walk up.\n\nI ask if I can ask them a question ICly, keeping it friendly the entire time...I wait for god knows how long, nearly walking off thinking she went afk...than she blinked right at me. Taking this as a sign that was her way of saying I hear you, I asked my question IC...I wait that same amount of time for a response...than...she stands up...and walks away...\n\nDid she miss my post? Did it get lost in the chat and just assumed I was standing there? No...because I sent a whisper saying if she didn\u2019t wanna rp, i\u2019d have just accepted a comment saying as much...that was also ignored. \n\nThis happened last night and I put her on my ignore list, but i\u2019ll never understand why someone would say they enjoy walk-ups, than promptly ignore walk-ups. Part of me wonders if it\u2019s because my question was pertaining to how she became Lightforged, and still retained demon characteristics...maybe she got defensive...but unless i\u2019m harassing her OOC, that\u2019s no excuse imo.",

We have a post-apocalyptic roleplaying setting that's shaped by the player decisions and actions. The lore is flexible and so on. It has always been a dark and realistic setting and everyone has been fine with that. here's blood, gore, violence and torture. And yes, some of the violence just is sexual in nature. \n\nI'm not sure when it started but gradually our server started to shift towards more smut/NSFW oriented. We still have one member who doesn't want to do anything of sexual nature at all. And it's.... Difficult for other members. \n\nShe writes female characters. Now, the thing is, it's HARD to interact with her characters since she doesn't want ANYTHING sexual to happen to them. Not even fade-to-black or hinted stuff. And honestly, it's getting a bit annoying and feels like her characters exist inside a bubblewrap when compared to rest of the cast. She's fine with violence and other stuff, just nothing sexual.\n\nAnd yeah I realise she was on the server before the smut-ocalypse happened. But eh, do we really need to keep catering to one person when everyone else wants to do what we do?",
