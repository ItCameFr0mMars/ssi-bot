            "selftext": "The title pretty much says what today's story is about. So I'm someone who puts out ads to rp every now and then (mainly if my other partners have been too busy or if I've found that more than one has just rudely decided to leave without saying anything) and yesterday I had someone respond to my ad via comments. Now every time I make a post a make it clear that you have to dm me for more details and saying you're interested in the comments means yes you wanna jump right in. So I responded to the person assuming they wanted to get right into it (let's call her E), E decided that I should pm her instead. Now this was kinda the first flag, they're meant to pm you. Not comment then say you have to pm them. Well I pm'd her and the first thing she did was tell me how she didn't like the examples I'd given because of how I described the role (despite the fact I said literally in almost everything that we can discuss and negotiate what happens) and demanded that I tell her what kinda characters we were to use (it was for a dragon rp), I just calmly explained them then gave her my discord. Oh how it escalated from there. On discord I gave her my character ref and it wasn't even two seconds before E went rabid, claiming that this character wasn't LGBT simply by his looks and personality. That was a really big insult, all my characters are LGBT+ regardless of what they look like and I'm also LGBT+, she was very happy to make stereotypes and assume I wouldn't say anything. E copped quite a mouthful from me and then tried to play the pitiful \"it's just an opinion I didn't mean anything by it\" card (she wasn't really justified to use it). After arguing even more that I was too argumentative and that I was preventing her from doing what she wanted, we proceeded to rp. Surprise surprise she gave terrible one liners and one worders for an hour straight before claiming she had to go to bed. I woke up this morning to find that E rudely left. I'm upset a little bit because of how I was treated and that she wasted my time but it showed me exactly what kind of rper she is. Rude, self entitled and overall a brat.",

            "selftext": "A short bad and general rant about a toxic person in a community I moderate. If you remember my post about the superhero server, this is the same general group- Myself, Platinum (the admin, and a very good friend), and the bad roleplayer that we'll call 'Iron'.\n\nIron wasn't necessarily a completely bad writer. He was able to keep up with long, multipara posts, and his prose flowed decently... But he had a few glaring issues. Iron *always* played Gary Stu murderhobos- You know the kinds. Half-demon edgelords who aggressively push themselves into interactions without ooc consent and is far too overpowered... But we're a SUPER oc-positive server (which is a good thing! ocs are generally good), and he never technically godmodded, so we were super gentle with him.\n\nAside from that, Iron (who was a minor) was the kind of person to... Aggressively push for ships, ooc, especially with regard to a lot of Platinum's characters. Iron had a type- Namely, cute, femme boys- that Platinum played a lot of... So he would constantly ping her and harass her, begging to be able to 'keep' her characters. He would also talk, at length, about her characters crossdressing or being forced into crossdressing- With emphasis on the 'forced' part. He tended to fixate on any femme male muse that any of us made being put into humiliating situations, in general, actually, but Platinum got the worst of it by far.\n\nNow, Platinum's absolutely lovely, but she has never been a confrontational person. That, however, is why she has me. I have something of a reputation on the server as being strict, and generally I'm the one confronting people about any shitty/rule-breaking behavior, which I'm fine with. I also tend to confront Platinum about things that I'm worried are making her uncomfortable, including Iron's constant advances. Platinum admitted to me, in DMs, that Iron's behavior did indeed creep her out, but since he technically wasn't breaking any rules, she wasn't sure what to do. I told her I would handle it.\n\nI called Iron into DMs to confront him on it, telling him in no uncertain terms that his behavior ooc was making people uncomfortable, but Iron brushed it off by saying 'oh, they're just jokes'. I told him that they weren't very good jokes, and told him to knock it off. Iron got defensive, and asked me who complained. I, of course, refused to tell him.\n\nCut to Iron heading into the general OOC channel and asking, word-for-word, \"which of you sensitive vegan cunts complained about me?\"\n\nI'm not making this up, I promise you, Reddit.\n\nAnyways, Platinum was in a very bad position, emotionally, but she replied to Iron, asking him to stop. Iron refused, accusing me of making up complaints against him because I didn't like him. Platinum stepped in, telling Iron that she was the one who made the complaint. Iron's response? \"Fuck you. You're a fucking lost cause, you oversensitive n----- cunt.\"\n\nAnd yes, he used the hard r.\n\nThis was justification enough for me to swing the banhammer down on him, banishing him from the server. Unfortunately? I'm the kind of person who sets my DMs to 'friends only' on Discord, so I added Iron to my friends for mod business and forgot to remove him once I banned him. Iron responded by spamming me with gore and slurs (the n word, the f slur, pretty much every name in the book) all while demanding he be unbanned. I responded by first reporting him to Discord, then blocking him without so much as answering him.\n\nTL;DR because this got way longer than I intended for it to be: Edgy underage roleplayer creeps on admin and gets banned, and thinks spamming the only mod he has access to with gore will somehow get him unbanned.",

            "selftext": "I'm not really sure what to tag this as, as it is partly a rant, my bad, and advice needed.\n\nI fell in love with tumblr style rp back in 2012 (save for the fancy format stuff). I loved that you could create a blog with an aesthetic to match your muse, the easy tagging system, use icons, and have little pages with headcanons, rules, about, etc. I even liked that you could add music! I loved that you could reblog posts relating to your muse's interests, get asks from anyone, etc.\n\nThis was always an unpopular opinion I had since day 1 within the tumblr rp community, but I actually really, **really**, liked that *anyone* could read your rps, like them, and reblog them.\n\nI was a somewhat popular rper back then with over 2k followers. I only roleplayed with about 10 people at most, and all my other followers were just \"normies\" that loved my writing.\n\nThis was what kept me writing. In truth I was bored by 90% of my rps, but the fact that I would receive daily messages from random people praising my writing was so encouraging. It wasn't just an ego thing, either. Most of the messages were from people struggling with mental illness, and they told me stuff I'd write would keep them from self harming, made them decide not to commit suicide, and that reading my rps gave them something to look forward to.\n\nThen around 2016 things got really bad in my life. I had to delete my blogs for safety reasons since I was put into a dangerous living environment.\n\nFrom 2016-2017 I lost the 2 muses, too. I even ended up almost not liking the main one I played due to him getting crappy character development in canon that completely changed his personality out of nowhere.\n\nBy 2018, I had pretty much erased anything from me on the net to the best of my ability. I'm still not in the best living situation, so I have zero desire to put my identity out online in any form. However, I still have the desire to rp.\n\nI got a new muse and went back to tumblr. I made a 100% new blog; no kind of announcement that it was \"me\" again (which I'm **so** glad for).\n\nTo my unpleasant surprise, the tumblr rp community was not the same. I only had my new blog/muse 2 weeks when I got an infamous call out post going around about how dangerous I am--that I'm an abuser, and this-that-and-the-other-thing.\n\nThe part that had me really confused was that I had **no** roleplays on my blog yet even! I had about 3 different starters that were open, but no replies.\n\nThe call out post had screencaps to *prove* that I'm a dangerous person. Upon clicking, it was nothing more than my rules page. I read further on op's and the reblogs mental gymnastics, and I was apparently because I mentioned in my rules page that I would rp topics like abuse, manipulations, gore, dubcon, kidnapping, torture, and so on...\n\nAnd they are all things the muse has done in canon, as he is an antagonist and all around shit person. I had that I would rp those things WHILE noting for my partner to tell me their triggers so I could respect them.\n\nBut nope; according to these people, because I was willing to rp such topics, to write about such things, despite it being fiction, that it meant I was capable of doing such things in real life. Therefore, I should be considered dangerous, and stayed away from (except for keeping an eye on me so a paper trail could be made in order to inform others for their protection of my \"intents\").\n\nThe ironic part? The op of the call out post also played said muse, except they were \"canon divergent\"... Where they are a good boy now instead of a meanie!\n\nI just could not believe this all, and I had no energy to be dealing with that bs. So I deleted my blog and once again tumblr was a *safe place*. Yay~ op of call out post saved the website!\n\nNow it is late 2019. Since the incident in 2018, I've tried to rp on Discord, but I ALWAYS end up dropping the rps because I get bored easily...which I feel bad about. I have the desire to roleplay, I desperately crave an engaging story, and I really miss the fun tumblr offered me with all the aesthetics and reblogging. I miss having an audience. I don't feel the same just writing for 1 person.\n\nFanfiction bores me even more, too. While I could get the audience there, I lose the will to write since I already know what is going to happen. I bore myself. At least with rp, there was a chance I'd be sucked in the story, and it excited me to not really know what was going to happen next.\n\nI've thought about going back to tumblr, but I've read other accounts that there is a really toxic purity culture there now.\n\nSo this is where I ask for the advice in wondering if anyone knows of a good tumblr replacement. I know Dreamweaver is an option to make public, but that can be difficult for people to find you on.",

            "selftext": "I remember, yeeeeaars ago, on Tumblr, I set up a Hyperdimension Neptunia multi-muse indie RP blog. Those were a huge thing in the Neptumblr community at the time, and I wanted to give it a go too! And I quickly made acquaintances with most of them, including a Nepgeo (or it may have just been Nepgear) roleplayer. Yep, someone chose a minor NPC as their muse, and it was actually really interesting in concept! She was a pleasant person to chat with.\n\n...well, we then both ran into the same issue. As soon as it was revealed that we, the muns, were (young!) teenage girls, that's when we both received messages from other RPers who claimed they wanted to \"fill our loli holes\" or \"lick the lolis.\" At first we believed these messages to be in-character messages, speaking to our muses, but as it turned out, it was the muns talking to US. We were being called \"lolis\" and receiving sexual messages solely because the people behind the blogs were underage girls.\n\nI'm 20 now, but it still sticks with me how incredibly grossed out and alienated I felt, how it drove me to leave the Neptunia RP Tumblr community entirely, and how I'm pretty sure this drove away the other girl too, and it overall lessened my opinion of the Neptunia fanbase in general, even though I so, so badly wanted to believe, and wanted other people to believe, that not everyone who enjoys this ecchi series were creeps and pedophiles.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen to them in Neptunia RP? Does stuff like this STILL happen?",
