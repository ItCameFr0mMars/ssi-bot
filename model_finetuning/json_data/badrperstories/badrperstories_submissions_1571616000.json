            "selftext": "This happened a while ago, now, but another post here reminded me of it.  I joined a roleplay server for an action-themed game.  Not much was going on.  The server was full of vampires, adventurers, guards, powerful mages, undead/immortals, but all they ever seemed to do was stand around in taverns chatting with each other.  I wanted some combat and action.\n\nSo I decided I would create some tension.  I created a \"heel\" character who was an absolute snot.  She was constantly picking fights with people.  She was a liar (a very obvious one) and a scammer.\n\nBut... these people were either too stupid or too disinterested to pick up on any of this.  No matter what she did, I couldn't get anyone to actually get mad at her.\n\nExample 1: Some guy said something that irritated my character while they were in a tavern together, so she purposely stepped on his foot.  He didn't react.  So she did it again, this time grinding her heel down on his toes.  The player said OOC, \"Um, what is she doing..?\"\n\nExample 2: My character explained to another character that her \"friend\" had some goods that needed to be looked after for a few days.  These goods were being stored in an empty house, which I described as having a smashed in lock, and could you pretty please hold onto these things for me for a few days?  The other player didn't realize he'd been used to help break into a house and transport stolen goods until after I had my other character explicitly clue him in.  And even after he learned the truth, he did not confront her about it.  He pretended like it had never happened.  The worst part is that this other player was RPing as an elite guard.  I picked him specifically because I thought a guard character might like to have a criminal nemesis, but he simply didn't care.\n\nExample 3: My character wanted to kill this one dude.  She left a note with his family detailing a job offer that was very obviously fake, in an attempt to lure him out to a deserted area.  Her target, as well as all of his friends who read the note, just didn't care and didn't try to report my char to the guards or retaliate against her in any way.\n\nObviously I quit the server.  There's nothing wrong with people who only wanna do slice of life, but it's just not for me, and idk why you need to be a powerful immortal creature to RP baking cookies or whatever it is they did all day.",

            "selftext": "I have a friend whom I\u2019ve been rping with a long time, almost two years now. I\u2019ve started m to notice that I\u2019m becoming less and less happy with our stories as of late, which I\u2019ve been attributing to as bad character writing. Every character, whether original or fandom-based, ends up just being another version of the same person. This ends up happening on both sides, though I try to fight it at first.\n\nWith my partner, it just feels like I\u2019m talking to her (or her ideals) rather than a fictional person. She inputs her own person interests in them\u2014 which is perfectly fine to be honest and can be quite fun imo\u2014 but she ends up doing it for literally every single character she plays.\n\nFor example, she adores Gordon Ramsey irl. Well, so does this OC, and *this* furry character tries cooking because of him. And *this* alien character doesn\u2019t understand his insults but goes around calling his lover a \u201cfucking donut\u201d because it\u2019s just oh-so-funny and totally not hurtful or OOC at all... Oh, and they all have crushes on famous chef, naturally.\n\nI feel that, normally, this would be okay. Personally, I myself don\u2019t like the inclusion of actual real living people in our rps, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal, and I can let it go and joke about it like normal. But the fact that it has to be for every single person she plays?\n\nThat\u2019s not the only interest, of course, and I honestly don\u2019t feel she overloads them too much (not intentionally), but it\u2019s rather boring and kind of getting irritating at this point.\n\nFor myself, I tend to gravitate toward more brooding characters myself (I know, I know, edgelord alert, but I like them because they help me cope with my depression), but I swear I do like to *try* different personalities. But I don\u2019t feel I stay consistent, or get to because my partner seems to just find ways to dislike or even *hate* the character I\u2019m playing. And I\u2019m such a pathetic doormat that I keep trying to alter my character\u2019s reactions or even the character itself to fit her liking.\n\nAnd so I end up getting unrealistic roleplay and boring circular dialogue that goes nowhere. Romances that spark way too soon and inorganically, drama that\u2019s unnecessarily over-the-top, and wins that are just unearned and artificial. She\u2019s enjoying this dull, soulless world while one left twisting.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling this way for some time now, but wasn\u2019t sure if it was imagined or not. Today, however, really helped cement the glaring problem for me.\n\nA little backstory here, I swear it\u2019s important. If you\u2019d rather skip, head to the *** down below.\n\nWe have these two alien leader characters that come from the same race, a race of beings that are absolutely *not* known for love, peace, and acceptance. My OC, who we\u2019ll call V, is supposed to reflect that\u2014 she\u2019s often analytical, blunt, and ruthless. A bit emotionless and even callous at times. She is not supposed to care for creatures beyond her own people and her very tiny circle of loved ones.\n\nMy partner\u2019s character, C, is the polar opposite\u2014 she\u2019s kind, caring, and optimistic. Idealistic even, believing that everyone can change and be better. She takes food to \u201clesser life forms\u201d, constantly gets on V for \u201cbeing mean\u201d to their young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (who are canonically SELFISH IDIOTS and are constantly screwing things up), and she has an entire menagerie of pets she thinks are cute (but this is not meant to be any twisted sort of collection, just my partner wanting to have pretty animals for kicks).\n\nC is actually considered defective by the race\u2019s standards, but my partner also wants her to be loved and admired by everyone and thought of as like a mother figure. To a race of beings that canonically have their young grown in *test tubes* and immediately treated to adult knowledge thanks to technological advances.\n\nA tad annoying to say the least.\n\n***\n\nSo my partner gave a hypothetical today. Her character C brings home a cute little kitten (this is yet another interest pushed on all of her characters) and proceeds to beg my character, V, to keep it.\n\nV\u2019s response is to allow it because it makes C happy, because a happy C lets V focus on other tasks, *like ruling the planet*.\n\nMy partner then begins to insist that V would see said kitten and be very infatuated by its sweet furry everything. Um, no. I personally would, yes, because cats are awesome, but V would not be impressed or interested, at the *very least* not right away. I tell my partner so.\n\n\u201cUgh, that\u2019s so boring,\u201d is her response.\n\nI know I\u2019m overreacting. I know I\u2019m reading way too much into it. I can\u2019t help that though. I\u2019m just too damn sensitive for my own good. But that hurt me on so many levels that I\u2019m about ready to start screaming at her and dumping all of our stories into deletion limbo.\n\nMy characters are \u201cassholes\u201d because, holy shit, stars forbid I have an OC whose unresolved trauma actually still affects him. Or another character that doesn\u2019t appreciate repeatedly being called a \u201cfucking donut\u201d and snaps. Or a character that is naturally too deeply set in her ways to change *overnight.*\n\nAnd now apparently I\u2019m boring.\n\nI fucking hate this. I\u2019m seriously considering never rping with her or anyone again.",

            "selftext": "First time posting here, usually lurk. I've been a DM for multiple different systems for years now, so I'll start with 3.5. I'll use fake names for the players.\n\n1. *(In Person)*My first campaign was a 3.5 campaign where the party banded together out of circumstance and were aiming to escort a noble back to the capital. The second session they were setting up camp and one of the players: Amy, was on watch. She heared noises in the distance and made a few checks to investigate, I explained that there's a small pack of Goblin's setting up camp, she believed attacking them on her own would be ideal, leaving the rest of the party sleeping. Fight ensued and she realized she's going to lose so she began to yell and make loud noises to try and wake the party members. Unfortunately by the time they got to Amy it was too late, she had been knocked down and failed checks to survive resulting in her death, the party beat the goblins and began to mourn. Amy then spent the rest of the session crying and complaining, resulting in me having to cut it short to console her.\n2. *(Online)* **NSFW:** I've ran for many different players over the years and the most peculier to me was a very promiscuos woman we'll call Elly, I likely should've seen the warning signs when she said she wanted to join the campaign. See Elly's biggest fetish was to get pregnant, something that became obvious through her interactions with every male character and NPC in the campaign, now this wouldn't be a problem if I had to run a smut campaign and I had explained such to Elly which just resulted in her being more subtle at the start of sessions. Sessions with her would go as follows; the party would make their plans for the day, Elly decides that she wants to try and get pregnant and flirts with everyone she can, sadly there was another player: Jeff who was a min-maxer that loved rule sharking and arguing with me. Jeff encouraged her attitude and they'd hold up entire sessions with 'important rolls' on how they were doing in bed. I realize now looking back there were many different ways I could have dealt with this but at the time, I think I ran two sessions and decided to scrap the campaign, I do think they became a bit of a thing afterwards so I suppose that at least something came of that! \n3. *(Online)* Tina fully sabotaged my campaign after dying. In this sci-fi setting the party were trying to find there way out of a city that was currently under martial law. They go to a club where there is a large amount of guards, criminals and corrupt law enforcement, the plan was to talk to a mob boss and try to find an illegal way out of the city. The mob boss was a male version of Cruella De Vil, wearing a clear thick coat of fur. One of the party members got into a fight at the bar and Tina decided to shoot the mob boss who had plenty of guards around him.  Rather quickly she was taken down and used a feat to get back up and continue her attack at 0 hp. I had zero intentions of killing her despite the decision until this momen, Tina was killed and the other party member who was with her was taken, resulting in a plotline where the rest of the party had to find them.  Now this was what caused Tina's sabotage, she spent time privately talking with every player, shit talking all of my decisions, asking for more information just to insult it. At this point I'm trying to discuss with her how to work on her next character and myself and all of my players believed it was her fault. From Tina's point of view, it was entirely my fault because I introduced a character that kills small animals, what baffles me is Tina is completely okay with the darkest elements of roleplay and in graphic detail, but if a character hints that he kills for fur then I've taken it too far.  She was and is still a friend but effectively destroyed any steam my players and I had for that campaign.\n4. Myself, as a DM I have ran about over 50 different campaigns. I don't know where it goes wrong but there seems to be a stigma I have about my parties getting over level 12 in DND settings and the joke when we run other campaigns is that \"What's the level 12 of this book?\". It's something I'm looking to conquer, did anyone else have this issue or a DM with the issue and did you ever get over it? I don't like to blame it on maybe one or two players flaking but I struggle to understand it.\n\nMaybe I should just start a campaign at level 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nSo I roleplay a lot with this person. This person plays as more than one character and they do really great at their role. (Note: this happend long ago. The details are fuzzy but I remember the main parts. )\n\nSo I was playing with my friend and they were playing as their two of their characters Gleam and Pete. In the roleplay my character (Emerald) and Pete were turning Gleam good and we were doing great with it going through hardships and stuff. \n\nWhile playing we met this guy. (Note: Our RP had magic involved and it is easy to get attracted to.)\nHe came up to us while me and Gleam were arguing. He pops in and then stops our fight. Soon we let him in and his RP name was Jake. We RP for hour and he got in mine and this other person's little group. \n\nSo after our meeting and RP with each other a lot I guess this guy did not like it anymore. So one day I was on a game by myself and RP by myself. (A bit lonely but nobody else was on.) \n\nJake comes on but he was not on a good mood. He then starts yelling at me. He goes on about how he was done and we fought. I thought this was part of our RP but I was wrong. He just left me and I blocked him. \n\nThen I talked to my friend. They did not know what was wrong. And we decide to go and follow him into a game. The friend was playing as Gleam and I was playing my character still. \n\nAlso it was a fun fact that Gleam liked Jake. So this is when crap hit the fan. \n\nGleam and I confront Jake. He was with other friends. Jake would only talk to Gleam though.  Soon Jake and Gleam argued but I was done. I think Gleam was crushed because of Jake and his friends. Soon enough we got out of there and we were taking this as a part of the RP.\n\nWe never saw him again. He is still blocked only account and I never want to see him. Though me and the person that plays Gleam and Pete and other characters still play very often. \n\nTl;dr: Guy comes in to RP and then ruins his reputation with us by leaving me and a friend very rude.",
