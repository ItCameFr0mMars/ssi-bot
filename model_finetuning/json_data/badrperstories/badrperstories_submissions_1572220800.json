            "selftext": "A lot of people don't seem to realize how hard it is to play a shy/anxious/quiet character.\n\nIt's easy enough to play an outgoing character with no filter whatsoever. You don't need to delve into their mind and describe small giving ticks about how they're actually feeling or think about what the character should say or not say and how to word it. Playing a character type like this is VERY difficult, and I can only imagine it's a master level for some who has no experience with being shy or quiet.\n\nAnd yet the amount of people who expect these types of characters to approach theirs FIRST is utterly ridiculous.\n\nThe story goes like this:\nI was on a roulette type website (I know, sue me) and when I go there I usually have a starter ready since I think it establishes what style I write in and a plot very quickly. I still add OOC notes at the end of it, though.\n\nIn this particular prompt my character who has crippling anxiety and never really made a blip on the map had amnesia due to being hit on the head. (The reason leading up to that is triggering so I won't go into it since it doesn't matter all that much in this story). I explain all the context and whatever and say that preferably the other person's character would pretend to be/actually be a friend or significant other.\n\nNow, despite me absolutely loathing having to make an anxious character approach someone first, I had mine bump into theirs in a hall.\n\nThis person's character is immediately pissed at mine (because they're going the 'actual significant other' route) for not talking to them for months. My character is very confused because to them, they don't know this person. So he doesn't know what to say other than that he's been in the hospital.\n\nDoes this other character change their tone from anger to worry? Are they worried to death that their boyfriend was in the hospital for months and they weren't there for them?\n\nNope.\n\n\"And you didn't tell me?!\" (Said in a way like he had a birthday party and didn't invite the other)\n\nMy character is still confused and the others storms off so my character assumes that they need time to cool down and if this person truly is very important, they will eventually talk to him. I decided to timeskip until lunch and had my character sitting alone (kind of a hint that now would be the time to talk to him without freaking the HECK out)\n\nSo what does this other character do? This other character that is very confrontational and impulsive?\n\nSit alone as well. As if MY character who doesn't know who the HECK they are, has crippling anxiety, and only memory with this person is intimidating, is supposed to try and make things right with THEM. \n\nSure, I could've talked it out OOC. But I don't want to continue playing with someone who refuses to move the plot along and can't take any logical steps to do so.\n\nSo I said to myself, \"Haha, no.\" And disconnected. This whole rp was maybe four responses long.",

            "selftext": "This post is a little bit more lighthearted than the stuff I usually post here, but it still annoyed me a little bit. \n\nThe setting of the multi-player RP this takes place in was your typical fantasy high school. With vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, the whole deal. It was not very realistic or dark, a little bit more comedy oriented. I created a vampire character who was not well liked, an asshole and kind of a bully, but also very insecure. He was not pretty, had some issues with impure skin,  not good at sports, and so on. He made some snarky/tactless remarks sometimes, but he was not the type to get into physical fights. \n\nThen, there was this female character. She was your typical fantasy nice girl. Super pretty, but more cute than sexy, with a special background (think of stuff like half dragonshapeshifter/half witch), described as sensitive, empathetic, always nice and polite. My character made a snarky/mean remark to this once, about the dress she wore. Well, I want to make it clear that I did not intention to make my character likeable, and I was always fine if other characters disliked him (that was kind of the point of the character).\n\nBut this time, the reaction of the other character became a little bit...questionable. Basically, every time when they met, she would outright bully my character. Telling him that he has no friends at all, mocking him for being a little bit gender-nonconforming (he had long, black hair ) and his clothings style (okay, that was fair considering what he did), making mean-spirited remarks about the possibility that he might be gay, even playing 'pranks' on him that put him in physical danger, constantly talking with the characters that were her friends about him in a negative way, making vile comments about his impure skin, and much more. He sometimes said some mean-spirited comment back at her, but often, this was completely unprompted.\n\nSo don't get me wrong, I would not have minded a reaction like this at all, if it would have been a better fit for her character. But a super nice girl mocking someone for stuff such as having impure skin or being abandoned by his parents? Gathering all your friends to mock his looks? That was just too vile. I almost began to pity my own asshole character because her character was so mean to him. And she continued to act as if her own character was this little ray of sunshine with no mean bone in her body...it just did not make sense to me. At all.",

I messaged him through reddit asking why and he said it was because he didn't feel like rping and had partners. Why the fuck would you put an rp ad up if you didn't want to rp? I knew he was lying about the having other partners thing because I was one of his partners technically and the only one who'd responded to his ad. When I voiced this he claimed I was harrassing him? I honestly will never understand how people feel like they are entitled to wasting another person's time then ditching them claiming incompatibility despite never actually rping. We had such a good plan and setting too so I honestly do not know why he did what he did but I do honestly doubt his 'partners' (I honestly think he's lying cause there's no doubt he treats others like this) will stick around if he does the same thing.
