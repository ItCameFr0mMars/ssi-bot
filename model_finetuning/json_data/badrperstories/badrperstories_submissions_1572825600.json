            "selftext": "This text is half venting, half advice wanted. \n\nThis is about a group rp I joined. I soon became friendly with the moderator, let's call her Lena. Lena and I got along well. When the first character I created had no other character to write with, she immediately gave me suggestions which scenes I could write with him, and asked me to join a group of characters so I could write him. When I created a second character and expressed doubt that anyone would interact with him (small group), she even created a new character just so that I would be able to write him. Needless to say, I was very thankful.\n\nWell, of course it went wrong. When Lena told me she was looking for new members for her RP, I asked a good friend of mine, let's call them Kim. I told Kim 'this is a great RP, the moderator really takes care of it' and so on. Kim joined, and soon created their first character. And here is were the problems began. Kim would ask for suggestions from Lena, but all that ever came from her was 'I have no opinion on this' 'I do not know which scenes you can write, I have no ideas for your character' 'Nobody is free? Well, I am not either' (even though we could have added Kim's character to our scene). I soon became a little bit ashamed of Lena's behavior. But I thought, well, maybe she has personal issues and lacks motivation at the moment, and therefore her answers are so out of character for her.\n\nShe also stopped writing one of her characters who was in a scene with mine in March, and only mentioned it in July once like 'Yeah, I know I should write with Johnny, but I am concentrating on a different scene at the moment'. No apology, no 'hey, is it okay if we pause that scene?', nothing. \n\nKim had no possibility of writing her character, considering that one of mine was in a scene out of which he could not escape, and Lena thought it was impossible to fit their character in the other scene we were writing at the moment. No one else was free. So Kim did not write, they just waited. Kim also did not participate in the chat for the rp often, because it was often just people talking about plot ideas and character in which Kim was not part of. Soon enough, Lena called her out for not 'being interested' in the RP. I came to Kim's defence, told Lena that Kim was still interested and simply asked me if she had a question concerning the RP, and that it was impossible for them to write at the moment (because Kim had no other characters who could write with them). Lena begrudgingly told me that Kim could at least have participated in the chat. I found that a little bit unfair, considering that neither she no any of the other players did anything to make Kim feel welcome or include them in their conversations. But I realised that it might be better to start with a different character, so that Kim could participate.\n\nKim created a second character, and I created a third character just for them. They were supposed to be best friends, with Kim's character being a bit of a role model for mine. Suddenly, when I created this third character, Lenas ideas came back. She immediately wrote me a message on how this character and one of hers might be friends, and so on. Now this was the last straw when I realised 'wow, it really is just favoritism'. Mine and Kim's characters were very similiar personality wise, and still, Lena had only ideas for mine. I was taken aback. \n\nSo, me and Kim start of, we write our characters for some time, then real life hit me like a truck. I apologized, Kim said they would wait for me. Time passed. I wanted to try writing again yesterday, when I came to the realization that Kim's characters had been deleted from the rp. I asked them about it, they said that they did not delete them, so Lena must have deleted them.\n\nIf she had kicked me out of the rp, this would have been fair in my opinion. I even told her before hand that it was okay to  delete my characters from it, as I haven't written for a long time and did not know if I could find the motivation for it again. But deleting the characters of Kim, who literally could not write because 1.) their first character had no play partner, and no one of the other writers was free and 2.) their second character was in a scene with mine and it was my turn to write? But not me, even though I am the cause of the second problem? And she did not even write Kim a short message, asking them why they do not write or explaining why they deleted their characters. Nothing.\n\nThere was a dude that hadn't written since freaking February, with no apology, and he was allowed to stay in the rp until October, when he left himself. Kim's last post was in September. Lena has this character which she hasn't written since March even though he is in a scene with mine. Still, Kim was apparently blamed for hindering the RP. I am at a loss for words. I do not know how to react now. Kim is not mad at me at all. But I do not know how to confront Lena. Any tips?",

            "selftext": "I'll tl;dr below. Hopefully though, it's a cool enough story, and you'll like it. Fair warning, touchy subjects ahead so be careful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo World of Darkness is already set up to be a very Dark settings. I mean, it's in the name. Still, I usually shy away from making a dark past character. However, I'd been getting very good players and storytellers to keep going. Werewolf the Apocalypse helps make it easy too. A lot of the story is around your rage. You character's anger at how evil the world is; How if you could just rip it to shreds to fix it, you would! Now, now you can.\n\nSo I wanted to try pushing my limits. I made character who's past was filled with abuse from their family. Her father cared more for her brother, and her brother took full advantage of this. At first, she simply accepted it. Then, she fought to be better and stronger than her brother. Finally though, when she realized how much was stack against her, she snapped. She killed her brother in anger. \n\nHer father wanted her dead for this, but a group who knows these things don't come out of nowhere stopped this by moving her away and hiding. This didn't fix her real situation though. She knew what she did was wrong. She knew that she deserved punishment. Her only hope was to try to repent for it, in some way or form.\n\nThus was how she was added to the start of this game. She was pitched as highly experienced to rest, but with a horrible reputation to everyone around her. The players only knew she killed her brother \"in jealousy\" and she was taking care of the \"pups\" because that's all they could trust her with to redeem herself. To me, this was the first \"clue\" to the other players. Most people with empathy should understand... something is up. Not like right away, but probably would try to find out.\n\nSo, to not make this too long. Further sessions with this group continue and further \"clues\" are given. She fails by getting stuck separated from the rest of the group, which almost gets the rest of the group killed without their \"fighter\". When they find this \"death machine\" later, she is curled up in a ball, shaking and talking about how horrible she is for failing. Even later, She has a flashback of her past in front of them, and almost rips herself apart trying to fight back the phantoms of her past, yelling out about how \"she's not just a punching bag\".\n\nThe final kicker in a session were we are all sent into our dreams, and have to deal with them. A door represents each of us, and out dreams. Their doors are all.. well normal. My character's is a clawed up shoddy wooden door. We go through their dreams first, and most of them are just warnings to their self. \"If you go down this path, this horrible things could happen\" or \"Losing your mom sucks, but keep moving forward\" even one that was \"Hey seriously, those people are just prepping you to take over a task no one wants\". Overall, the ending of each one only occurred when the person who's dream it was, realized why it was wrong and refused to accept the fate their dream set.\n\nMine.. Mine was much different. Each door had a clue at the start, and the clue for mine was \"what could have been\". Stepping through that door was amazing. The Storyteller hadn't told me, but he had faith that I could pull off something amazing. He messaged me in private to run the dream, and my task was to make both my character and the world change to \"What if you had been loved equally by your father.\" I had also apparently failed some previous roll, and unlike everyone else's dream, I didn't know I was in a dream. The other players then had the task to realize this, and realize they needed to fix this. Fixing this, meant reminder her of her past. Reminding her of her past, slowly changed the world around her back to reality from a happy family, to the abusive one it had become. They got to slowly see her descent as she got less and less love from her father, and the abuse got worse and worse. Then, they realized what they had to do to end this dream. Get her to kill her brother. And they did. She may not have remembered her past in the dream, but when she walked out she remembered her dream.\n\nSo here is where I started to get confused by these other players. After all that; after seeing her get abused and literally having to be the ones to push her over that edge in that dream... They actually started to use that abuse against her! They heard her in those dreams talk about how she was \"just a training dummy, and punching bag\" and after the murder was \"just a killer\". They started using those exact terms against her whenever she tried to push them to a task that they didn't want to do! \n\nWhen a bad guy took a player's mom hostage, one of the OTHER players tried to sneak her away without telling the plan to others. Unfortunately he made a loud noise, and the bad guy went to push the death button in front of my character. She immediately jumped the bad guy to try to kill him before he pushed it, but was too late. What did my party do? They blamed my character. Literally said things like \"You killed my mom, just like your brother\".\n\nWhen another player did his best to not help the rest at doing anything dangerous (for example when he literally took advantage of a moment of invisibility to slip away and sit in the car while we all fought a big baddie as planned), after winning the fight, she went back. She grabbed him and brought him back to the elders of this group to judge him for his actions. He admitted everything and was punished by the elders, who deemed him worthy of shame (They changed his voice to be a shrill and piercing nasal whine, until they decide he makes up for his crimes). In retaliation, the player left both in and out of character. He told the storyteller that his character would run, betray the party, and tell the big bad evil everything and start to serve the big bad evil. So what did my party do in the game? They blamed my character! \"You scared him away! All you do is get Angry! If you didn't send him to get punished, he wouldn't have left! He's just scared of you killing him!\"\n\nThis pattern continues! One player pulls a knife to another player's throat (who was not threatening him). My character is one of two characters who jump in to try and disarm him. They both try, but she's the only one successful in doing so. She gets blasted for \"almost hurting him!\" \"He's just like this because you scare him!\" (reminder, we are all capable of regenerating). Later, everyone has to make a choice to save a city by either trusting someone who took control of one of our party and tried to taint a holy place(and hope the person isn't lying about a fix), or go through a portal into a dangerous place and find the \"for sure\" cure there. My character (She is the Leader) decides to call a vote since everyone is very divided on what to do. The vote won to go to the dangerous place. One of party that didn't want to go ends up dying there as we find the cure and save an entire city. You guessed it, the rest of the party isn't celebrating. They call her a \"murder\" for \"letting that person die\". When a party member who keeps lying and betraying us does so for the 5th time, she finally gets mad at him and explaining how this time had almost killed some of them. He runs away and gets hurt because of it, and what do the rest of the party say? \"You just scare away people for no reason! You're getting people hurt!\"\n\nThat list GOES ON. I could keep this going for a while. Now to be clear, there was always one player that always was like \"What the heck? You're all crazy, she did nothing wrong\" but at almost all times it was the one person defending her, and the other 2-3 players calling her \"good for nothing but killing\" or \"Just a death machine\" etc. Is this normal!?! Should I just not risk playing a character with previous issues? Or did I just end up with an \"oops! all sociopaths\" party? Or did they think \"Hey, she made a abused character. She obviously wants us to continue that abuse!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - Is this common for players to see an abused character, and then just pile on them? or did I just play with psychopaths?",
