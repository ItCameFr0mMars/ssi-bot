            "selftext": "So... it's entirely possible that I'm (21F) just trippin, and that's kinda why I'm posting here. Basically, I've been talking to this dude (21M) since the start of September. We've been RPing for longer than that, maybe since May, but we only added each other on discord when I left the forum because of another person, so the 2 of us could still continue writing.\n\nWe've been talking non-stop on Discord, like every day, sometimes for 4 hours straight in the night. Every friggin day.  Then last Friday I told him about a date I went on (although I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about it). He continued replying to me for another hour...\n\nAnd then boom, he was gone for almost 48 hours before he updated me on his thesis progress (something we've been discussing). He did this in the beginning sometimes, but lately it was very rare for us to go 24 hrs without talking. I'm thinking,\n\n1) maybe that 3rd person talked shit about me to him, although it's unlikely that he disappeared bc of that, bc literally before he disappeared he mentioned something negative (although kinda minor) thing about them for the 1st time ever.\n\n2) maybe life got in the way, I guess...?\n\n3) he's mad I still haven't replied to our thread (which I'm sorry for but finals are killing me)\n\n4) he heard I was dating IRL and somehow didn't like that? This is the only version I could come up with that explains why he became so inactive so suddenly. \n\nWe officially never saw each other's face although he knows my name, city (same as his) and university so he could have easily found me on social media. But it just doesn't make sense, maybe I'm overthinking and he just wasn't really feeling it for a few days. I mean, do you think a person would do that (disappear because I told them I've been on a date)...?",

            "selftext": "Almost a year ago, I got into RP in a new MMO setting. I'm not new to RP but it's been a refreshing change from my last one. Since then, I've had some amazing partners, scenes, story arcs, and character development. However, one group of people has repeatedly been frustrating to interact with. Every time I introduce a character or idea to them, they show great enthusiasm and express interest in RP with me, but then fail to communicate when I try to co-ordinate with them and set something up. They frequently cancel what few plans they do make with me in favor of a more insular experience with only a handful of people. I don't mind this, but the issue is that they only tell me they're going to cancel at the very last minute when I was led to believe that they meant to follow up on their plans with me.I only get vague answers to questions like 'when  are you available?' Or 'is x/y/z day good for you?' Sometimes I get no answers at all, and it's like my words are falling on deaf ears. The RP I've had with them in the past has been spectacular, and I'm not quite ready to give up on them just yet. I still have other friends and groups there, but these are some of the only people I can explore certain concepts with. What's the best way to proceed? Is it worth it to keep trying with them? Should I back out and look for other options?",

            "selftext": "I love RP a lot. I'm a fan of a group RP, as everyone has (usually) vastly different characters and ideas and it's fun trying to make it all work. But, recently I find it's more tiring mentally than it is fun. Mostly, it is the plot stuff. I'm moderating this modern supernatural horror sandbox type forum. It's been fun, but less so now because I get often asked *'Well what can we do?'* but like all the time regarding plot.\n\n\nI've offered ideas, my character's and reasons they'd interact to get things going but when over one person has shown an interest, no one ends up taking it. I just get a *'Oh, that's cool!'* and then no follow through like no one wants to be the one to take the neat idea or something. \n\n\nOr on the flip side when an idea gets going, people just want to jump in but there's no major planning so I'm then left scrambling trying to make it work in the aftermath. It's kind of stressful in character trying to manage it. Out of it, sometimes there's one member who's been a little passive aggressive. Announcing they were bored, or wanting to RP but when I try to offer ideas, or solutions it's just not happening. Or they directly ask me what they should be doing all the time and I try to come up with stuff because RP is about fun and all that but my dudes. At this rate my muse for this RP is going down the drain.\n\n\nIt's like they think I just planned for every single character involved, but there's a lot of OC's and I love the enthusiasm but my goodness it's getting hard when it seems the pressure of coming up, maintaining, and moving forward the plot seems to just fall onto me.\n\n\nI've tried to remedy my growing weariness with coming up with plot. I've offered a plot/scene area where people can make requests and ideas known. That way it doesn't get lost in the chat, and I know they have ideas so it's a good way to showcase that I want more input from them. Still empty though. I've thrown out multiple ways OC's can become involved in ways that don't directly involve my OC's (So I can take a mental breather) but it doesn't seem to take. They're for it, but it's like they are too nervous or something. I've all but screamed from the rules section that I want their ideas, and plot points and backstories to come into use, but I'm left with all these puzzle pieces trying to mash em together like a possessed toddler or something.\n\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I'm getting anxious just looking at my email notifications because I know as soon as I come online there's going to be questions of *'When are you posting this idea?'* or *'What can we do next?'* or *'What should we do here?'* and I am just **Big Tired**. I feel better after venting about it, and I will continue to try and think of ideas on how to ensure I'm not the only one responsible for managing ideas in the RP.",
