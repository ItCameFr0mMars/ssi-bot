            "selftext": "Actually, I do not really hate them, but the way some people try to incorporate them in every single RP. Not for their characters, which would be fine b\u00fd me. But for mine. And this pisses me off so bad.\n\nYes, characters can change, their can be character development, I am not against that. But if I want to play a character who is lazy, a liar, lacks morals or is outright evil...I actually want to write them that way, at least at the beginning of the RP, not just for three replies. I once wrote RPs with a girl, and every time a new villain/not so nice character appeared in the RP, it was like her 'redemption-arc-mode' was activated. Often with their characters heroically teaching mine that their past behavior was bad. She imagined these conversations to go like:\n\n1. My character steals something\n2. her character confronts and tells him 'You know, stealing is actually not nice'\n3. my character saying 'OH, nobody has ever told me that. Okay, I will stop it from now on, thanks for your help'\n4. happy end\n\nIf the scenes did not play out like that, she would get angry, and tell me that characters who do not change are boring, everyone needs character development, and so on. For me, that is not character development, it is just...dumb. This stuff needs time, nobody completely changes their behavior just because some stranger told them to. Some people do not want to change their behavior.\n\nAnother problem was that she imagined that if her characters forgave them, everyone should do that to. So you had scenes were a villain, who has pillaged villages, killed numerous people (often even torturing them to death), was forgiven by the king of the country. And suddenly, the citizens are the bad people for not being as forgiving to someone who has literally killed their families. It was always framed in a way that if one of my characters dared to say something like 'hey, maybe not the best idea, he is a murderer after all', they were suddenly the evil person, who does not allow the poor villain to be happy. \n\nEvery thing had to end with people being happy, living in harmony, and every evil character turning good. It was so unbelievably boring.",

            "selftext": "Hey ya all, I finally encountered a bad roleplay to talk about here :D\n\nWarning, this might be a *taaaaaad* long; also English ain't my first language so don't mind any small mistakes and the like.\n\n So, if anyone saw my other post, I roleplay Danganronpa characters on Discord. I made a bunch of memories and friends there - along with memes - and overall I never experienced anything bad with a few one-offs; however, everything changed when I joined a FCFS.\n\n I was looking for a quick roleplay to fill my time between one that I got in, one that I applied to and one that I am modding with few others, so I started looking through one of the fangame's bulletin boards. After a few minutes, I saw a roleplay ad with limited info - so basically, a lazy ad. However, my gut told me to join it for lols and I simply agreed. So I joined it. As I was joining it, I was also talking on VC with few of my friends and they asked for a link too because they were bored.\n\n So now you have five or so new people on the server.\n\n We looked around and it was what you would expect from FCFS roleplay - no setting, little to no app, **Publically sent apps** and the like. All of us decided to app for lols as we were bored. With that, here comes our cast:\n\n**Me**, who applied a Time Lord(yep, Hideyoshi is back for more chaos);\n\n**T**, who applied a Sumi-e Painter;\n\n**K**, who applied a Candy Confectioner;\n\n**S**, who applied a Kleptomaniac;\n\n**M**, who applied an Impersonator;\n\n**R**, the mod and the main reason this story is in here, who applied an Arms Dealer - there were also few other people but they aren't important.\n\n So, we send in our apps - not full apps, as this was a FCFS so they didn't have such things as 'How probable is it for your character to be a killer/victim' and we wouldn't post our private backstories for the sake of the discord word count - and we get immediately accepted. That wasn't a surprise after seeing some other apps that were applied there. So, the cast is 'picked' and the date of start is picked to be today(29.11.19) - FYI, this happened last weekend - and we get a sandbox open. However, this is where things go down as the sandbox is held in the *exactly same places as the main roleplay will.* Not only that, but there were no descriptions or consistency at all. The setting was a school and FOR SOME REASON there was a bar. Why? I have no idea ~~not like I complained, my character loves alcohol.~~ So we wake up in the classroom, interact with each other and the mod's character leaves.\n\n May I also say that in the rules, it was stated to not Godmod; this will be important later. Back to the story:\n\n So, the **R's** character left and despite there being a hallway, they immediately went for the storage room. Remember no Goddmoding rule? This isn't the end. Like I've said, the setting is in a normal school - with a bar for some reason - and guess what **R's** character finds in the storage room? An RPK. **RPK.** For those who don't know what an RPK is, it's basically a **Soviet Machine Gun** \\- because every school has those in their storage rooms. So, a mod character has a gun now...\n\n...it won't end well - and it didn't.\n\n After some time, everyone was called to the gym for some reason, only for the main mascot(?) to announce a killing game. I remind you, this is a **sandbox.** The Killing game shouldn't start until Friday. But I and my friends roll with it because we didn't expect much from it. So we go out again and interact - making some pretty nice interactions with each other - until something... Weird happened... \n\n Remember when I mentioned that other people aren't that important to this story? One is. They applied an Artist who was veeeeeery similar to just a copy-paste of Bob Ross. So **R** decided to meme and make the character be called Bob Ross. Anyway, that's enough of the info on them. So, some time later, while waiting for a response from **T** and **K,** I looked over at the channels, only to see that Bob Ross was shot dead for no reason. Yep. Someone was killed in a **sandbox for no reason.** And that wasn't the end of it.\n\n Later, **S** and **M** were interacting together and for some reason, again, **R's** character came and shot them in their kneecaps. So that was fun. Not. But you think this ends here? Nope. We have one, grand, finale left after which all of us left due to deciding this isn't worth our time!\n\n So, the whole gang was in the kitchen - so **Me, T, K, S,** and **M** \\- because **T, S,** and **M** were already there and then **Me** and **K** went there to make some smores. Then suddenly, out of blue, some sort of Gas started filling up the room - after some googling up we learned that it was a highly poisonous gas from WW1 times, and it was then when we decided that the entire thing is happening in Russia - but it turned out it was a joke after we made our characters panic. You know. Like normal people would react when they are being gassed? Then we had this exchange - which is paraphrased and is ooc btw:\n\n**R**: You know the gas is a joke right?\n\n**Me:** So we won't die?\n\n**S:** Shame\n\n**T:** *Sent the Shame.gif*\n\n**R:** If you really want to die I can kill you right now\n\n**M:** Please do\n\n**K:** Yeah\n\n**Me:** We gonna be fine in main rp anyway\n\n**T:** Yeah\n\n And with that, we were shot to death by the mod. Now, I know this seems like it is our fault, but can you blame us? If your roleplay is so bad that people want to die before it even started, I think there's something wrong. What happened next is just a clusterfuck of bad roleplaying that I might mention in another post once I'll get more examples of portraying mental disorders and personalities wrongly. But after a specific accident, we decided to just leave it.\n\n On side notes, here are some of the highlights that weren't that bad, but were bad regardless:\n\n* **R's** character constantly specifying he has an RPK - when it was more than obvious - and then wondering why no one wants to talk to them(therefore creating a meme of when one of us would get someone's attention and say that 'he has an RPK' and the other person would act surprised);\n* **R's** and another character teleporting to locations out of blue - remember the Godmodding rule?\n* The mascot teleporting where interactions were going nicely just to stirr chaos - not good type of chaos;\n* One character being stated as 'emotionless' - which I'm fine with - but later shows emotions(make up your goddamn mind);\n* Heights that made no sense - aka a 19-year-old with a height of 3'4\";\n* People reacting toxically to constructive feedback;\n* Someone applying a Country Ball and it being accepted as a valid student.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, now me and my friends joined a better roleplay. It's still a FCFS because we can't commit ourselves to a fully pledged rp with google docs apps, but it is SO much better. There's more information provided about the setting, the people there are so nice and the atmosphere is just wholesome. So I guess this story has a good ending too - I found a different rp and created a meme with our friends while you all get a story to read. \n\nPeace out\\~!",
