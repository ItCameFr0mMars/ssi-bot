            "selftext": "Howdy folks. You might have already seen my post about Fae'ler'on on /r/rpghorrorstories , but if not, a few friends and I have put together a satirically bad roleplaying community and we're opening it to the public. It struck me as something that'd be right up this sub's alley.\n\nBasically back in October a few fine folks made the Fae'ler'on boards, a forum RP with the premise that everyone roleplays as the various users of an OOC board for a shitty fantasy RP. In other words, everyone is roleplaying as a bad roleplayer. It's been a lot of fun - threads are overrun with edgelords and Mary Sues, terrible typos, off-topic posts, petty arguments, vagueposting, rules-lawyering, goth furries, and a middle-aged man from Benin who's only there because his daughter plays and he wants to see what it's all about. The whole forum is run by an ineffective teenage moderator with an uncomfortably poorly concealed developing fetish. The artwork for various forum links is a sludge of dead links and placeholders. The admin doesn't know how to remove items from the news ticker or lock/delete threads. The whole thing is a a glorious trainwreck of every bad roleplayer forum user you've ever met.\n\nWe've had a lot of fun with it, but after a while it tapered off and it's been dead for weeks now. I figured as long as we're done with the game, we might as well offer it to some others, and wanted to make the game public for anyone to join. If you're interested, [you can find Fae'ler'on here.](http://faeleron.freeforums.net/). We've temporarily suspended the approval process to join to make it easier for people to get in, but we may re-implement it if we see an influx of low quality posts or spam.",
