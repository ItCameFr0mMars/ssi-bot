            "selftext": "So this is my first time using reddit in awhile but I think I get the gist of it! ((I will say we didn\u2019t actually start the roleplay))\n\n((english is my second language so there may be a few errors but I like to think my English is good))\n\nCharacters (not real names) :\nMe : ((who else would it be?))\nKay:  ((roleplayer))\n\nSo there is this app I\u2019ll call K, it\u2019s an app where you can talk to people and it\u2019s commonly used for roleplay, and not gonna lie I\u2019ve had a lot of good stories from this app, but non compare to this one. \n\nOne day I got online and realized I had a few new messages one simply saying \n\u201cHELLO!!\u201d From a user named Kay (not the actual name of the user) So I reply like normal, \n\n\u201cHello, do you need something?\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cYes actually!! I was wondering if you would like to roleplay with me!!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cUh sure...what do you have in mind\u201d (me)\n\n\u201cWell I was thinking a romantic roleplay.\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cOh okay! So just two characters in love?\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cWell I was thinking s^xual\u201d (Kay)\n\nAt this point I was already a bit uncomfortable ((after all I had never met Kay before this))  but I thought it was fine, after all I had done roleplays with people I\u2019ve never met before \n\n\u201cUhhh sure!\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cSo what characters do you have? And what are their personalities? Do you have a page on them??\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cYeahh!! I\u2019ll be my character Gigi!! And can you be shadow???!! ((Not character actual names)) I really like the way the character looks!!\u201d (Kay) \n\n\u201cOh sorry but shadow isn\u2019t a character I feel would fit this type if roleplay\u201d (me)\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d (Kay)\n\nI then explained how shadow was actually asexual and didn\u2019t have any love interests, Kay protested a few times but then just accepted it.\n\n\u201cOkay what about chan!\u201d (Kay) \n\n\u201cSure, so what is Gigi\u2019s personality?\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cShe is nice, kind, sweet, and generally loving\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cUh okay...\u201d (me)\n\nMy character chan, ((not real name of character)) was supposed to be a narcissist, and generally rude, so I thought it could be a bit interesting.\n\n\u201cSo where does this take place?\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?? (Kay)\n\n\u201cYou know like the setting\u201d (me)\n\n\u201cUhh in a coffee shop!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cAlright..so what will the story be about generally?\u201d (me)\n\n\u201ci just thought we would make it up as we go!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cOkay-\u201c (me)\n\nSo we set up the roleplay, and I slowly began to realize this person was mostly interested in the s^xual part of the roleplay ((which is fine)) but suddenly it dawns on me to ask Kay\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cOH!! I forgot to ask!! How old are you??\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ten\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cTEN??!!! Like 10??!!\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cYeah but it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m okay with it\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cSorry but I\u2019m not comfortable with role playing something like that with a ten year old!!\u201d (Me)\n\n\u201cNO WAIT I WAS JUST JOKING IM ACTUALLY 17!!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know how I feel about this anymore-\u201c (me)\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d (Kay)\n\n\u201cUhhhh I have to leave sorry-\u201c (me)\n\nI feel like I more of avoided something there, I don\u2019t know if this is the right place for this but I don\u2019t know where else to put it, even though I didn\u2019t actually start the roleplay",

            "selftext": "TL:DR - Person claims to have read my roleplaying rules and character, ends up fucking up the whole roleplay and I get some revenge.\n\nBefore you read this, I will like to mention that my explaining and phrasing isn't the greatest so you'll have to be a bit mindful/lenient on that :)\n\nSo this actually happened again funnily enough! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give some context, I have roleplayed with this person a few times in the past. Four times to be exact.  This person is the type who just messages 'Hi' and one word replies, not really showing much interest in the rp. Normally when this happens, I continue talking to them and see if they'll type anymore.\n\nNormally when I start roleplays, I always go through this sort of process. I respond to requests in my messages, ask them what sort of roleplay they want to do, if they have an oc for that, what sort of plot they want to do and what characters each of us will play so one person isn't doing everyone. It's a fair process if you ask me. Normally, I get deacent roleplayers, people who respond with some detail, good plots and actually have some interest in the thing  we are going to RP.\n\nI understand that there are some people who have difficulties, like anxiety or have issues explaining or writing enough. So normally I ask people if there are things I need to know. Most of the times, I get info.\n\nToday is different. Now I shall introduce, the person who is apparently the fastest reader in the whole bloody world\n\nSo this person, as I said before has roleplayed with me in the past, broke some roleplaying rules (which I will provide at the end of the post if you're interested) and caused some issues in the past. A few months ago I had created a new RP account since I wanted to start over. This person, I shall call Jess, had messaged me on my previous account three times. So seeing her message me on my current account was no surprise.\n\nSo I respond to this person and tell them that I recognise them and if we had done a roleplay in the past based on a fandom I am really into. They said yes and they wanted to rp something new, another fandom I am in. So I said yes, of course but I have some new roleplaying rules. They ask me to send them, which I do and not even 30 seconds later. They say \"I read them.\"\n\nSo, Jess. You can apparently read 639 words (yes I used a word counter to count them) in 30 seconds? \n\nSo this is how the following conversation goes:\n\nMe: There is no way you read them in under 60 seconds. \n\nMe: No offence or anything (I apologise, A LOT)\n\nThem: I want to rp (fandom) and I re-read the rules\n\nMe: Right. Sure. Okay, we'll see about that.\n\nI was very sceptical at this time and really didn't want to deal with any arguing. After rping with this person in the past, I know it'll just end up in a \"no I did read them\" \"No you didn't\" back and forth argument. \n\nAt this point you may be wondering, why didn't you just say no at the beginning? I'll tell you why.\n\nNormally when bad roleplayers message me from the past, (if it has been a year or so) I give them another chance to see if they've changed so this is what I had done. I normally like giving chances because I know people can be a good person if they try.\n\nSo carrying on with the story. I ask them for their OC, which they provide a few minutes later. After looking at their OC, I instantly knew how this is going to go. They had written very little detail on their oc. For each part of their oc. Like looks, personality, background. All there was:\n\nPersonality: Kind, Selfless.\n\nLooks: Tall, red hair.\n\nBasically like that for EVERY single part. I already knew what I was getting into, so I carried on talking to them. I send them my oc. I am very detailed when it comes to OCs. Keira, my OC, has detail on every part of it. Backstory, personality, looks, flaws, everything. So it would have taken around a good 5-10 minutes to have a look through her. 5 minutes if you skimmed through. \n\nBefore I sent my OC, I want to let you know I edited my oc and added (So sonic, how long did it take you to read through this?)  at the end of the OC. \n\nNOT EVEN 1 MINUTE LATER. They reply to my oc journal thing and say. \n\n\"Quite a while, but I love her\"\n\nHold on for a second, so you're telling me. In your words, 1 minute is a long time for you? You lying bitch. (sorry for my language)\n\nSo I again I call them out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Me**: // 2 Minutes? That's a new record.   \n\n\nI'ma just guess you didn't actually read through it properly. Like the rules. You probably just scrolled right to the bottom.   \n\n\nAm I right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Them:** No I didn't actually, I read everything about her \n\n**Me:** //So you're now apparently the world's fastest reader?  \nHow did she meet \\*charater names\\*  \nWhat are her abilties?  \nWhat's her birthplace?\n\n**Them:** \\*character's birthplace\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that wasn't a sufficient test but I just wanted to quiz them if they actually read it. So I continue to set up the roleplay. You know how I mentioned earlier that I like to spread out the characters so everyone had a fair share of people to play?\n\nThis person decided to take 9 characters and leave me with 4, including my OC. I was pissed but I just let them do it.\n\nThey soon come up with a very basic plot and then the rp soon turned into a nightmare. \n\nCharaters were all over the place, no control was on their side. They hardly had people interracting with eachother. My OC was left out and I just gave up. What was my revenge?\n\nI just made the other person's OC's crush start questioning why things were happening so fast. The other person didn't say much but I had fun making the characters question the plot. There was some funny 4th wall breaks.\n\nI am going to be ending the rp with them, I hate roleplays when my character isn't included much and the other person clearly doesn't listen.\n\nI'm going to assume this person was at least 12 years old or 13. I'm not saying all young people are like this but this is what it's like with every rp with them.\n\nI do have another story about how someone apparrently \"kills themselves\" over a god damn roleplay. So If you wanna hear that story, lemme know :) I have a lot of stuff to share about that.\n\nHere are my rp rules as promised :D\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b41uh9yq3j341.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=414d1084ebbc4f08a4431edd36f0e79fceb1a3a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2s5jm8t3j341.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365d6cfb2854765197e5a5db84a055f830854bb9",

            "selftext": "This happened yesterday night. Its actually a two-parter to this story.\n\nSo once upon a time, on a roulette site that can either be gold or dirt for role playing partners, I had an idea for an rp. The idea doesnt really matter, just know that it was a realistic rp with two characters.\n\nThe idea seemed kind of outlandish to me and I was worried that nobody would be interested, but I've found that people ARE interested,  so thats always nice.\n\nSo this person takes an interest and we talk about the rp and everything. This is not done with OCs, it was in a fandom. I dont know how much that matters.\n\nSo my character canonically has anxiety, but my headcannon is that they have autism due to both me just liking characters that I can relate more to, as well as some things in canon that might suggest it.\n\nSo I write the starter and I forgot to mention that I headcanon that, so I mentioned it after the fact and asked if it was okay. I said that it wouldnt really be mentioned in the rp and it would only be shown through what he understands and how he acts. I didnt want to be one of those people who base an entire rp around the fact that a character has a disorder of some kind.\n\nThey immediately got offended, told me to fuck off and that someone can have anxiety and not be autistic. Then they disconnected, never to be seen again.\n\nI was upset for a while because that of all things was what made this person leave. After what I thought was a pretty reasonable question. We didnt even have to include it at all, which is why I asked if it were okay with them.\n\nOnto part two. I was looking for that first person to try to explain myself when another person asked what happened since I had some explanation in my name. I explained the story to them, and my wifi has been really weird with blipping out for like 10 seconds and then coming back, so I had to disconnect on them.\n\nWe run into each other again and they ask why I disconnected on them when they were defending my point. I apologised and explained again and then they let me know that theyd be happy to rp with me.\n\nIt made me a lot less upset than before since they were totally okay with the autism thing. In fact, we make it a part of our rp.\n\nThe premise is this: Their character takes my character to the park since they has a hyperfixation with plants and my character doesnt realize that it was supposed to be a way for the other character to hit on mine.\n\nIt was cute and funny at times. But then their character kind of goes apeshit about how my character doesnt even care about them, wouldnt even care if they left, blah blah.\n\nThis interaction goes on for way too long, and so my character eventually has to explain that he has autism so he wasnt trying to do anything bad. All of the sudden their character is perfectly okay but of course feels really bad. \n\nNow, when we discussed the plan for the rp, this was where their character was supposed to be sympathetic and try to, i dont know, communicate better.\n\nInstead their character thinks the solution is to just avoid my character after that. So of course my character thinks that the other is avoiding them because of his disorder.\n\nThen my wifi  cut out again. Good, honestly.\n((This post seems to be too long to post so Im gonna fit the rest somehow",

It turns out, this person was 13 and I was (at the time) 16 and it quickly went from somewhat eagerness to start to awkwardness.\n\nThis person ended up saying they didn't want to anymore and that they were very busy anyways, and I agreed, but it did kind of suck. It was not anything inappropriate, it was about a gardener becoming friends with a creature it finds in the garden one day.\n\nNext person I was going to try to RP with was 18, and I was still 16 (at the time) and they said they didn't want to RP because we were going to do a romantic one and didn't want anything coming back to bite them because of the ages.\n\nI'm not one to really step out and try to find RP, but I find myself commonly running into people who are either 18+ or 13 and below when I do and it's just a bit aggravating sometimes.",
