I feel like a burden on them, so I feel like telling them goodbye after a year of getting to know them. Though, I'd feel bad about my decision since they have nobody else who's so willing, but I'm just a stubborn idiot at this point so they should really move on for better rpers...",

            "selftext": "Since this subreddit exists I just wanted to complain a little bit about my roleplay partner. I never played properly with anyone else. We\u00b4re playing together since ve were kids so maybe ten or eight years because one time there was a pause in our friendship. Most of the days I\u00b4m enjoying our rp story bud there is always time when it starts to get boring. So just change the story right? But quess what? She doesn\u00b4t want to. I totally get if she just doesn\u00b4t want to play for some time. That\u00b4s ok! We have school and our problems at home but I don\u00b4t see the point in keep going. I\u00b4m not perfect roleplay partner but I dare to say that these boring phases are mostly because of her. Most of the time her replies are fast and short (and believe me I got nothing against shorter replies) like: *Martha was eating. A*nd that was it! I usually try to write a little more but most of the times she replies with another very short sentence. So I usually stop writting our rp but shortly after she is writting me that I owe her reply. I don\u00b4t get it. Is she enjoying this? Writting the same sentences without sense? \n\nAnother problem is that she\u00b4s often bringing her emotions into her characters. Which is fine to certain extent but her characters are sometimes completely and suddenly out of character. \n\nI will probably be looking for another rp partner (but I still be writting with her because sometimes... sometimes our rp is great) problem is in my country there isn\u00b4t many of them. \n\nWell thanks for place to vent a little and sorry for mistakes.

            "selftext": "So, where to start...  \n\n\nI joined a Star Wars server, a relatively new one and I was looking to make a character, one of the things I was considering was playing a Hutt, so I asked if that is possible.  \n\n\nThe answer I got shocked me. I was told, that appears to play a Hutt I would need to speak Huttese in character. Now, this was stupid for obvious reasons, as generally in RP when there are multiple languages in question, you simply translate it to the language the RP is in, assuming in character you can understand it.  \n\n\nThis was made even more stupid by the fact that on the server, there were other races who have their own languages in the Star Wars universe, and they all spoke English! I thought that this might be a misconception because Jabba speaks Huttese in the films, but he appears to be the only Hutt that does this, and he uses a translator droid.  \n\n\nI said that Jabba does this because he is a prick, who wants to show off the superiority of the Hutt race. To which the owner derailed the conversation completely saying that \"No one is a prick for speaking in their native tongue, Spanish people in America speak Spanish all the time! They are not pricks...\"   \n\n\nNow, I said that if you wanted to speak to someone who does not understand Spanish, in Spanish, while you both understand English, but you refuse to speak English because you are a Spanish supremacist or whatever, that would indeed make you a prick. For which I got banned because I am apparently \"ignorant\".  \n\n\nI wonder if I got banned if I came to the server speaking in my native tongue, which is not English BTW, but Czech.",

            "selftext": "I used to do a lot of RWBY roleplaying when I was into the series, I loved making teams and finding interesting dynamics.\nSo I'm playing someone who had their face horrifically scarred after being attacked by grimm (basically evil animals) in the dark, thus developing a fear of it. He always wore a mask cause he felt ashamed by how he looked. We'll call him Luca\nAnother guy is playing a character who wears an eye patch, and has a split personality, switching the patch to the other eye when he flips. Let's call him Ren.\nThen we have a blind girl, I don't remember a whole lot about her character but I remember she had a dog and was trying to hide the fact she was blind. Let's call her Daisy.\nAnd lastly is Mary Sue, apparently the most beautiful girl in the entire school, she can control nature and a bunch of other broken shit that we found out later.\n\nCue first day, we skip over the exam and Ren somehow got hurt, so we are all trying to help but Mary Sue wants to help more, so she TRAPS US IN A BLACK VOID, baring in mind that she was trying to get with Luca, mostly to take off his mask, not a good idea to put the main with a fear of the dark in a black void.\nShe doesn't realise she has basically given me and the blind girl (we both agreed in pm it would make a sweet couple but we wouldn't force it) time to get to know eachother. She then leaves and we are left to assume we can leave this hell void.\n\nA few days pass and Mary Sue has passed out and can apparently only he awakened with true love's kiss, Daisy is saying it is likely Ren but Mary Sue is making it VERY apparent that it is Luca, the character who now wants nothing to do with her after the void incident. So now I have to cut the whole reveal of taking off the mask just so she will actually join in, Ren and Daisy are in the room and Luca puts his mask back on immediately after, so Ren was the only one who actually saw it.\n\nA few more days pass, Luca has now made it very clear that she puts up with Mary Sue for the sake of their leader, Ren. Mary Sue immediately abandons her team to get with random character she just made, John, who could apparently beat all of us without any problems. Whatever, neither Luca or Ren were interested in her and didn't care if she was dating someone else. For some reason Mary Sue has a habit of making animals talk and tell her she is the daughter of a goddess and keep saying how beautiful she is.\n\nFew more days pass, Ren has been kidnapped by the thugs that Luca was on the run from (did this cause irl Ren was gonna be busy for a few days and he said he was cool with this). Luca and Daisy out here exploring, camping and fighting, Mary Sue refused to come until she realises that shipping is happening when Luca asks if Daisy knows how to dance. Apparently Mary Sue can teleport now cause she went from the capital to butt fuck nowhere within 10 minutes when it took Luca and Daisy several days. Confrontation between Luca and Mary Sue, Luca demanding an explanation as to why she abandoned the team and how he doesn't trust her at all, John apparently teleports too cause he is there now, saying that he's gonna knock Luca, the man who stole from thugs straight out of Mad Max after escaping from them and killing some of his captors, meanwhile John went to school and that's all the combat training he has ever had.\nRp is now dead, Ren is still being held captive and I like to think that Luca took off his mask and knocked John and Mary Sue out with it for not caring about Ren, the best bro a horrifically disfigured shotgun wielding weirdo could ask for.\n\nWell I've got tons of rp stories with insanity like this including more with the same Mary Sue, if this gets some love maybe I'll post more ^-^",

            "selftext": "I feel a big part of toxicity regarding roleplaying is how much we must rely on others for every aspect of this hobby. To be a good roleplayer, often someone uses empathy and acting to write a convincing character. Those emotions can make people more vulnerable as well. But unless you make fake accounts you can't rp by yourself. Doing it solo, it becomes a different hobby entirely: fanfic writing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd it's part of a bigger problem, how toxic social hobbies and activities have gotten. Look at Twitter, YouTube, MMOs and online shooters. They need other people to keep going. For being so connected with the rest of the world, we've ironically become more isolated instead. Blocked, ghosted and forgotten. In the eyes of many, there are millions of others that can replace one person, and that's saddening to me.",
