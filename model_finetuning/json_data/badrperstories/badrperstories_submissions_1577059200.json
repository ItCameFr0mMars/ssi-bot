            "selftext": "I have one such RPer. They mean well, but have no restraint when it comes to thinking up new ideas. Eventually I almost had 30 threads running at the same time and it got overwhelming. As much as I love RP, switching between so many threads got me into writer's block.\n\nSome things I tried to migitate the issue while recovering from writer's block:\n- Discussed \"fusion\" of ideas. This means combining small thread ideas into one bigger thread, which also helps keep the plot fresh and ongoing. Example: one thread about werewolves and one about vampires, combined into 1 thread about werewolves vs vampires.\n- Made an ideas list channel on Discord, dedicating 1-3 posts per theme/AU/story. If a new idea came up, said posts would be edited to include the idea.\n\nAnyone want to share other tips and experiences with this kind of situation? Has anyone got writer's block out of it and if so, how did you get past it?",

            "selftext": "I was reading a discussion on another site about toxic roleplayers, and some people had some interesting ideas, just trying to explain why the stuff in here and in /r/rpghorrorstories happens. And I think you guys here might be better able to explain it.\n\nOne person said:\n\n&gt; Lonely and extremely socially awkward people tend to flock towards the world of make believe in order to gain the affection they believe they lack \n\nI think it's possible this is it. I think that:\n\n* Roleplay attracts a combination of people: (a) those who love fictional drama, (b) those who love to be creative and self-expressive, (c) those who want to put on a show for others, and (d) those who want to experience the fictionalized friendships and romances shown in media.\n\nI think that I have to be honest and say that I was socially awkward when I first started RP. I've since become passably functional in real life - job and marriage and all - but I still love RP, and focus on it more for the performative aspect, I love to become a diva on a stage that makes the audience go \"whoa dude\".\n\nI think that the \"toxic\" or bad RPers we find are most likely people who approach roleplay as a way to sort of manipulate others into becoming a kind of forced friend or minion, by either begging or manipulating others into playing this \"roleplay game\" with them, and trying to input minimal creative effort while getting a maximum emotional-fulfillment response from the good-faith partner, ic or ooc. I think this applied equally to stuff like D&amp;D, ERP, and other methods.\n\nWhat do you think?",

A different one from last time, here being on Discord, and this time the problem isn't about the game itself. \n\nThis was more of a beginner-intermediate level here. Small actions take around 6 words to describe and speech is generally around 1-2 lines, nothing special. \n\nWe got this one guy, let's call him Phoenix, and his character Elesa. Now Elesa, she has a dead mother who died in an accident, and BOY HOWDY does he like to mention it! He doesn't stray away from it either, his words are like, 8 words MAXIMUM. Here are some of his more frequent posts:\n\nElesa thinks about her mom\n\nElesa sighs\n\nElesa cries\n\nElesa *walks*\n\n'wow it's like the tragic accident with my mom' cries\n\nThe entire plotline of one of our arcs is a CARD GAME MAFIA, and this man still somehow thinks it can link to the accident Elesas mom had. Whatever time our characters have with Elesa around, Phoenix always tries to steal the focus back to Elesa by talking about her mom and everyone sending their condolences. Jesus Christ, is she your mother or a fucking pair of puppy eyes? If you have a dead parent in rp, sure. If you want to talk about them, go for it! But don't go out of your way to shove her into literally every conceivable convo. You spent so much time on your dead mom that no one can see what your actual character is like.",
