            "selftext": "Although this a short story, it is one of my most frustrating experiences in an group rp. It is about a fantasy rp which was mainly about knights. I love knights, so I decided to join. I wrote a moderator to discuss my ideas about my character. All of my ideas were accepted, until I mentioned that my character would have a darker skin tone.\n\nThe moderator immediately answered, telling me that 'all people with dark skin were slaves back then, a character with a darker skin tone will not fit in an rp about knights'. I pointed out that this was not true, and there are some knights in arthurian legend for example who are described as having dark skin.\n\nBut this was not accepted. The moderator told me that they were aiming for 'historical correctness' in their rp, and therefore, it was impossible. I begrudgingly accepted, and began to make my character overview. While making it, I realised that I did not know the name of the fictional country the rp took place in. So I decided to ask the moderator about more information for the background of my character. (short note: you could only see the characters of the other writers once your character had been accepted).\n\nShe answered: \"Oh, just imagine it like medieval England. Pick an English or a japanese name for him. Most characters are japanese, anyway.'I never left an rp so fast in my whole life.",

Clear cut, bla bla. \n\n\n\nMy Ad will say something to the effect of; \"I wish to RP as X kind of character in Y series.\"\n\n\n\nI always get people though who message me and will be like; \"So tell me about your idea.\"\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is there to tell these people? I mean what part of \"WANT TO PLAY X CHARACTER IN Y SERIES\" is difficult to understand?\n\n\n\nI do not have the entire plot thought out. I do not have some long-range plan in mind. I want to just play this type of character, and have fun with it. Usually I just want to follow the series along, just with my own character inserted.\n\n\n\nYet people message me, and I get the feeling that they think I have the entire RP mapped out. They want me to explain how my character affects the world. What their interactions are like. How is the story affected, etc... I have absolutely no clue! \n\n\n\nI do not know any of those things. I do not think that far ahead. The only time I seriously plot things out is when I am doing a serious roleplay. When my idea is just I want to play a certain OC in an established series, I tend to just want to follow the series. \n\n\n\nI do not have any idea beyond the type of character I wish to be, unless I have time to really think it out.\n\n\n\nI do care about my roleplays, and once I have a partner I can do all of that brainstorming stuff, but I wish I could be clear that I have no \"ideas\" beyond what is initially presented. If I had a long-range idea, like a full plot, I would put it into the ad for my RP.",

I decide to come back in 2018 I was on and off. I became active rper in 2019 on twitter rp since my laptop is broken. There\u2019s was like 3 rps I remember being good but close down either the admins ditching or the community force the rp to close because they didn\u2019t like plot twist including murder. \n\nI join recent rpg that is so basic like nothing is going on; there\u2019s this murder plot but it was all done before and its barely used. My character was burnout with a lot of edge to him actual got character. I was there from the beginning out of no where I got a message from admin saying I used aave because for some reason there\u2019s this imagination rule that only black people can used it as black myself [i haven\u2019t hear such thing in the real world] i was so confuse. I say I haven\u2019t used that word. Admin say that it\u2019s slang and I was so confuse like slang phrases I haven\u2019t used. Admin continue to say it two anons sending messages to the main knowing anons they can be one person sending multiple messages. I say you can take a look on my tl and see I haven\u2019t use anything you accuse me of. The admin went from two person to whole rp group is uncomfortable. What is uncomfortable theirs people talking about sucking vomit off person\u2019s dick but I\u2019m making the whole group uncomfortable because \u2018slang\u2019 [speaking slang isn\u2019t a black thing] I quit the group. I still don\u2019t know what the hell happened what is \u2018particularly words not being says\u2019 admin really say that to me. \r\n\r\n\r\nJust warning don\u2019t join anything that\u2019s have to do with tumblr/twitter the community is fill with witch hunters that\u2019s ready to burn you on the stake if they don\u2019t like your character. they wonder why tumblr rp is dying because they won\u2019t stop being trigger over every little thing and rpers can\u2019t have the rping experience to play character with ultimate freedom without being police. People that once was on tumblr that I know move to discord or finding other platforms. Please if you have any good rp platform do share :)",
