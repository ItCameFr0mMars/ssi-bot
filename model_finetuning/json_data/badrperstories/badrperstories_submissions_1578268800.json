            "selftext": "How entitled and inconsiderate does a person have to be to dictate to me when I should or shouldn't respond to roleplay? I have a full-time job, bills to pay, a house to clean and keep up to date with maintenance, the weekly grocery shopping and on top of that I'm helping out my family by looking after my grandfather who is severely ill, in constant pain and is always tired with cancer. So not only do I have to keep my own house together but I also have to do the household chores and grocery shopping for my grandfather. On top of that I have other things going on in the background that require my undivided attention. I don't how your work schedule is but in retail leading up to Christmas, and especially the month of December, I am required to work overtime.\u00a0\n\nKeep in mind that without the overtime I already work full-time. And not only am I taking on extra shifts but I'm doing overtime because it's Christmas. So throughout the month of December, excluding these dates: 25th - 26th - 27th - 28th - 29th - 30th and 31st of December, I was working overtime from the 28th of November right through until the 24th of December. The dates that are excluded is the days I booked off.\u00a0\n\nSo with working all those hours and taking on those extra shifts, paying bills, taking on both mine and my grandfather's household chores and weekly grocery shopping, preparing for Christmas myself by buying Christmas presents, wrapping them up, decorating both mine and my grandfather's house with Christmas decorations and everything else that is going on in the background of it all. In other words, when I wasn't working I was looking after my grandfather, doing the weekly grocery shopping, doing the weekly laundry, taking on extra household chores, preparing for Christmas and trying to look after myself and have a life in the process.\n\nWhen I wasn't working I was busy doing something else and when I was available\u00a0 I was catching up on sleep or having some me time. Now, I gave my roleplay partner a heads up that I most likely won't be roleplaying with them throughout the month of December but if I could find the time I would try. They were very understanding and didn't seem to mind waiting for my response. In between all that we chatted every now and then but our conversations were never passed five minutes. Even prior to Christmas, December and taking on all those extra shifts I did let them know that I wasn't the type to roleplay daily or even weekly.\u00a0\n\nI love roleplaying. It's a hobby of mine but I can't put in the time the way you or other people could. It's just humanly impossible for me to roleplay daily or weekly. I have far too much going on in the background and I'm not being rude when I say this but comparing all those responsibilities I have roleplay isn't a priority for me. I would never neglect myself or my loved ones for something that should enjoy doing in my free time.\n\nUpon our agreement to roleplay with each other he was more than okay with the fact that my responses would have a delay. Actually, he said that he preferred it that way as he doesn't like being under pressure and when he writes a response he likes to take his time. So I was under the impression that this arrangement was okay.\n\nBefore I did overtime I would always send in a response to him within two weeks. And my response was heavily detailed with multiple paragraphs. I always chatted with him days or weeks prior to sending in my response because I wanted to let him know I was still interested and he wasn't forgotten. I also made it known that I was appreciative of his patience and time. Which he always told me to stop being silly: that he was happy and enjoyed roleplaying with me.\u00a0\n\nLow and behold I get a message from him that basically says that I took his time for granted, that I hurt his feelings and that he couldn't understand why I couldn't find the time to write out a few paragraphs within the month of December\u2026 Even though I gave him a heads up that there could very well be a possibility that I may, or may not, be able to respond because there was just too much going on in the background for me. He said that he would give it one more week before deleting the server and unfriending me altogether. He also said that in future I should respond in a more timely fashion moving forward. Otherwise I'd be completely cut off.\u00a0\n\nMy reply? I left the server and blocked him. Now, I would understand where he was coming from if he hadn't heard anything from me or if I didn't give him a heads up, then I would be ok. He has a point. But I gave this stupid bastard a heads up. He knew what was going and why I couldn't talk and roleplay with him all the time. And be more consistent moving forward? Dumb fuck. We had an agreement that it was ok if we took our time. You've taken two or three weeks to send a response to me and I've never bitched about it. The only difference between us is that you have more time on yours hands. And I waited three weeks because you were playing games on Discord, roleplaying with other people or engaging in phone sex with random people on Skype.\u00a0\n\nGrow. The. Fuck. Up.\n\nI took your time for granted? You are an inconsiderate asshole who doesn't understand the concept of having a life, working full time, helping out your family and prioritizing responsibilities. People like you piss me off. Your feelings are hurt because I couldn't send in a roleplay response? My grandfather is fucking dying with cancer. He lives in a house by himself and he needs my help. Go fuck yourself you self absorbed prick!!!",

And when it happens it tends to makes me lost and empty. I lose interest and all enthusiasm in things I crafted and put my heart into.\n\nI would rather someone to ghost me right from beginning or slowly fade into oblivion after we both lose interest, than being ghosted by someone I connected with on so many levels.\nAnd sorry but I had to vent about this.",
