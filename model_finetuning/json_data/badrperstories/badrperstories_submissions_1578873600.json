            "selftext": "So, I've been RPing fora long while, and I consider myself semi-literate (9+ phone lines on discord), and I really love to find people who can match me. Now, I don't always measure based on length, I measure based on effort. If my partner is putting in as much effort as me and is trying, then I am just glad and willing to lower my standards just for this fun. I don't put heavy importance on grammar or spelling either since as long as I understand it, it's fine   \n\n\nNow,  a few times, I've ended up ending an RP with someone because I am writing long replies, putting in the effort, and I get a single sentence reply. There have been times it's been very early in the RP. I've got many 20+ line starters and people respond with a single line and I just end it then and there to save me the time, but this one guy seemed nice and fun and willing to learn, so I stuck with it.   \n\n\nAs we got deeper and deeper in, I ended up replying my usual length, and he gave me very little, spelling 3/5 words wrong and giving me very little. He was a native speaker, non-dyslexic and 18+ so there was no real excuse for this beyond laziness. I've RPed with newbies who have matched me or tried their hardest, and I was the same when I was younger! But this was just too much.   \nI asked, politely, if he could write some more, try and match me, or just put in some more effort, and he responded: \"But I'm new, you can't expect me to write that much!!\"  \nI ended the RP then, explained my issue and left the server. Every so often he keeps trying to message me, begging me to let him try again, but RP is something I enjoy, it's something I devote much of my time to, and when my partner isn't willing to put in the same effort as me, I just have to go.   \n\n\nDoes anyone else feel this or am I just a super picky person?",

I mainly like action games unfortunately. However, my friend really loves that series and has been begging me to roleplay it since it's his favorite. I like him as a friend and I want to do this since he hasn't ben having the best of days but I don't want to do the roleplay since I'm just not very invested in the game series and I know I'll ask him too much questions... But i want the guy to be happy, I seriously do but I just think I'm getting burnt out and i just don't want to bail or do anything wrong when he's looking forward to the roleplay. I've said yes already but I'm just terrified of disappointing him and ruining his day further with what I want to do because I think his happiness is more important but when I look at it from the long run, it seems to go downhill from there... What do I do?",

I'll admit it: I was part of the horrible \\*grabs peach\\* RPs before I got a lot better at roleplaying, but this isn't about me.\n\nIf you've been living under a rock for a while, the \\*grabs peach\\* RP is where a Bowser play spawns outside Peach's castle, types \\*grabs peach\\* and then basically Naruto runs to the Bowser's Castle point on the map. Usually, a Mario, Luigi, or Yoshi player would follow. (Probably gonna write more on the Yoshi types in that game.)\n\nThankfully, in Paper Mario RP Recrafted/RP Extravaganza, I haven't found any yet. But seriously, Why? The world's your oyster!

He tried to stop those 2 people, but still lost, and the criminal was brutally killed.
