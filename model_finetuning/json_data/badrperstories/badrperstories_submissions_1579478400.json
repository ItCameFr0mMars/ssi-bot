This time, we're covering mutants/RAD people, and how most refuse to listen to the PTK rule.\n\nI was RP'ing with someone, just being friendly to their character, and then a bunch of mutants/RADs come up to us. They basically overpower us, and drag us. I did not know about PTK just yet, but I wish I did. Anyway, back to the story. They had some kind of wild beast human thing kill my character, so I made another. I lasted about 12 minutes before they yet again killed another character. I had had enough, a bit of my own fault. SO I made a prisoner character, but he could take a ridiculous amount of bullets, and live. After blowing off some steam (And them kicking me out of the RP) I left. A lot later, I had just made a character in about 10 minutes, and I was walking around Boulder Cove (The town where most people spawn besides Craterview) . 2 more mutants show up, smash my character into a pole, and start brutally killing them. (Don't worry, after this, I learned what PTK was.) SO I apparently \"False voided\" them, just because I didn't want every single character I make to die in about 10 minutes. It's some of my own fault, but it's mostly the mutants' fault. Now you know why I want to try to be as fair as possible.",

Now, I'm not here to take their enjoyment from them, but I wanted to say, \"Please use the normal baby Yoshi morph, not the TTYD morph.\" And now we go the absolute salt of Yoshi OCs: The god-modders.\n\nThese players were baby Yoshis, right? But they had Dragon Ball-Z like powers, comboing characters to death. (If it can be considered like Smash Bros.)

I don't doubt that it is also a problem in other rps too, but with vampire rps, I have encountered it so often that I will focus on that. My problem with vampire group rps is that people just create their original characters without even looking at how the world was constructed.\n\nFor example, you would have 1000 year old vampires with 'royal blood', in a setting were vampirism is an illness which has only been spreading in the past decade. Or you would have some human characters who sell their blood in a setting were vampires are violent monsters who would normally just take it without paying for it. Or you would have backstories full of bullying, the parents were killed by famous vampire hunters and that kind of stuff...in a world were vampires are completely accepted by society and a vampire hunter would be seen as a murderer, not a hero. Or people would create original characters who were 'vegetarian' vampires who do not kill humans as some kind of a special thing, expecting their characters to be outsiders/weirdos because of this...in a world were nearly all vampires drink a substitute for human blood, and the ones who do harm humans because they want their blood are seen as criminals.\n\nMy point is, especially in this 'fandom' (can you call vampires a fandom?) I have met so many people who just try to force their original character into a setting only based on their assumptions what vampires 'have to be like', and who do not even read the rules and the history of the world...it sucks.",

(FOr instance, being related to Harry Potter.)\n\nWhat's the point I'm trying to make? On Minecraft, there's a server called Potterworld. You can join classes, explore the map, cast spells, and most importantly, Role-play. The few Role plays I joined, people mostly started in King's Cross. People would say they're related to Potter and whatnot. Me, I tried to play Callie (Y'know, from Splatoon) and that worked out fine. (Not really.) But there are some good RPers there.
