            "selftext": "So. Last time, I told you guys about how the admins of a popular Mass Effect RP server [destroyed a friendship because they didn't like someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/dbg29g/destroying_friendships_because_you_dont_like/), and now it's time to talk about someone who is arguably an even bigger douchebag than both of those people combined. And yes, I'm making a series of all my posts related to Mass Effect RP, because my adventures in this community have been a ride. A mostly pleasant one, sure, but there have been some bad parts too. So. Last time, I told you guys about how the admins of a popular Mass Effect RP server [destroyed a friendship because they didn't like someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/dbg29g/destroying_friendships_because_you_dont_like/), and now it's time to talk about someone who is arguably an even bigger douchebag than both of those people combined. And yes, I'm making a series of all my posts related to Mass Effect RP, because my adventures in this community have been a ride. A mostly pleasant one, sure, but there have been some bad parts too. (Now, just to be clear, this is less about RP and more about the types of dicks you can meet in your RPing adventures, so if you're looking for actual stories of bad roleplay, this isn't your post.)  \nSo after being banned from that first server for reasons I'll get into in another post, I wound up first on another, more private RP server (which also has its own big Bad RPer story - stay tuned for that), and then on another server that was, at its peak, much larger and more active. This, if I recall, wound up attracting our villain for this story, who we'll just call Bob.  \nDespite claiming to be mature and claiming to value professionalism above all else, I swiftly learned that Bob was, in fact, a massive manchild. We got along fine for months, and were, in fact, rather close friends, until one day when I had the audacity to disagree with him. You see, Bob claims to be more than tolerant of dissenting opinions *unless* his perspective on the matter is based in fact. Okay, fine, you can't disagree that water is wet, for instance, because it objectively is. But with Bob here, disagreeing with him is a minefield because you never know which of his many subjective opinions he considers to be \"based in fact\" and therefore objectively true and indisputable, but whenever you stumble across one and have the guts to continue to disagree, he will go to any lengths necessary in order to try to prove you wrong and force you to change your mind, i*ncluding* attempting (and failing) to make you look like a hypocrite in front of an entire RP server that has over a dozen of your friends on it, and on which you've worked extremely hard as an admin to keep active and drama-free.  \nHe did this to me once. And what was it that I disagreed with him on? What objectively true thing was I blatantly wrong about?  \n*I disagreed with him over what black paint does for a car.*  \nI argued that black on certain cars makes them look aggressive and mysterious, while he argued that black cars are universally classic. Okay, cool, I can see why you'd think that. However, he then tried to force me to change my mind, and when he failed, he dug up an incident from the day before where I criticized an awful wrap on a Lambo Aventador and tried to make it seem like I was saying that the owner of said Lambo should have no right to wrap his car like that. I assure you, you are not having a stroke - this guy is so childish that he can't differentiate between \"I don't like this\" and \"this objectively shouldn't exist.\" And by the way, his reasoning for trying to force me to think that black cars are universally classy? Because according to him, the first black cars were painted that way specifically to look classy. Sure, if you look through some old photos, you'll see that luxury cars from the early days of the automobile tended to be black. But come on. Do you have objective proof from any of their designers that they were specifically intended to be classy? No, you don't.  \n\"Alright, MCZ,\" I hear you ask. \"But why is this relevant to RP?\" I'll tell you why: it's to help set up what kind of character this guy is so you can understand the rest of the story a little better. So, shortly after the Black Car Incident, Bob leaves after everyone sees what kind of asshole he is, sets up his own server, and invites me to it. At this point, I think, \"Why not?\" because I don't want to let the Black Car Incident destroy our friendship. So, a new server, a blank slate, and the Mass Effect RP is getting off to a great start. However, over time, it slowly becomes apparent what Bob's real intention is, or at least seems to be from my perspective: this isn't an RP server, it's a political echo chamber *disguised* as an RP server. Remember when I said there are certain subjective opinions that Bob considers to be objective? Well, that extends to politics too. Now, a disclaimer - I can't actually speak to what Bob originally intended to do with this server. He could have intended it originally to be nothing more than an RP server, he could have intended it to be a political/RP hybrid server, I don't know. All I know is, political channels start appearing: first the #politics channel, then the #the-violent-left channel, and then #right-wing-winning (and possibly more after I left; I don't know).   \nIt's in these channels that he quickly assembles a gang of yes men consisting of Bob himself, his best friend (who once used a security loophole to ban everyone from the previous server, presumably at Bob's bidding - the one on which the Black Car Incident took place), and about four or five others if memory serves. Together, these people gang up on anyone who dares to disagree with the Almighty Bob on anything concerning politics, sometimes resulting in the person leaving the server outright. Everyone else on the server is pretty much cowed into silence or agreement, while Bob can post anything he wants without having to fear disapproval from \"gay race-baiting, Hollywood lefties\" (his words, not mine, even though he's gay and therefore has no right to hold it against anyone else).  \nNow, I'm not one to simply sit by when I see something screwed up, and I feel like some balance is due here. So I hop into DMs, ask him to add two channels (#the-violent-right and #left-wing-winning), and... that's it. Of course, this is met with fire and brimstone, another argument ensues, and I wind up simply muting the relevant channels. However, by this point, I'm becoming more and more disillusioned with the server and with Bob. Months pass as I simply try to ignore the bullshit going on in the political channels. However, eventually, I can't take it anymore, so I bring it up with Bob again, more arguing happens, and for that and other reasons I may get into in another post, I wind up simply leaving. Ironically, the last thing he sends me before I leave and remove him as a friend is an invite back to the server, for when I'm mature enough to handle others' opinions.  \nThat would be a great enough ending, but immediately after that, he banned another player *not* for breaking the rules, *not* for doing anything dangerous, but because he simply didn't like the guy's character. Apparently their chars had been beefing for a while at that point in another RP on the same server, and it had been Bob who'd started and continued it, trying to kill the other guy's character for no real reason other than a difference in ideology.  \nIronic.(Now, just to be clear, this is less about RP and more about the types of dicks you can meet in your RPing adventures, so if you're looking for actual stories of bad roleplay, this isn't your post.)\n\nSo after being banned from that first server for reasons I'll get into in another post, I wound up first on another, more private RP server (which also has its own big Bad RPer story - stay tuned for that), and then on another server that was, at its peak, much larger and more active.

It's written like a book, that one line. And for OOC, someone would usually type (Wait, hold up). Another style is using \\[\\] instead for OOC, or maybe, {} for OOC, but I don't mind. Another style, using my chair example is this: No! \\*She got up from her chair.\\* Or they could simply say, No! \\*Gets up from chair\\*.\n\nWhat's the point I'm making, you ask? In most RP games, they're almost always someone that doesn't use punctuation, doesn't really use () for OOC, or makes their actions different from their speech. For instance, without the \"\", I saw someone type \"kills\" in the chat, but I ignored it. But please, head my warning: Make your speech different from actions, use some form to describe OOC, and to go the extra step, write it like a book author would.",
