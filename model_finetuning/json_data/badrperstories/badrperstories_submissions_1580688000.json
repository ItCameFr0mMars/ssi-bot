It wouldn't be so bad if at least one of them had a shred of honesty and told me they weren't interested, but everyone just randomly disappears and never appear again. It's quite frustrating, roleplaying is supposed to be fun not this.\n\nI  don't even understand why it happens, I never ask personal questions, I never push people to do stuff they don't want to do, I never say anything harsh to the other player.... but every damn roleplay I've started this year as resulted in me getting ghosted! I'm so close to calling it quits and giving up, I've been roleplaying since the early 2000's but now it just feels impossible to get partners -\\_-",

            "selftext": "So, I roleplay in a fandom and everything seemed to be completely fine.  We both played semi-OCs; I am a bioweapon and he is a cop.  \n\nAfter we get through the planning stage, I post up and we are having a good time.  Suddenly, without any reason, he leaves me a note that we are not on the same level and he abandons the discord.  \n\nHe seemed upset, so I messaged him and he unloads that he feels inadequate to me and doesn't think he can keep up with me.  I console him, explain that I am enjoying our roleplay and if I have to wait(which I never nagged), then I would within reason.   He agrees, he joins up and we start again.  4 days later, he says that he can't roleplay for the next three months because he is moving in March and asks me to wait for him.  \n\nI said that we can leave the roleplay open after I explain that I am only making this exception because I am being nice about it.  I usually won't wait unless my partner and I have a few months in, not like 2 weeks.  So,  we agreed and I start posting ads again looking for the same thing because there is no guarantee that he will want to roleplay in three months.  \n\nSo, he starts messaging me with jealous messages. He asks me why do I need more of this fandom, especially if I already have it.  I explained that I don't, not actually, because I am not going to wait 3 months.  He seems annoyed, keeps asking if I found partners and is annoyed that I am looking.  I actually do not care, so I continue looking.  His jealousy gets the best of him and now he says he can do 1 reply, 1 time a week and I agree to that.  \n\nHe ends up roleplaying like normal, so I believe he was lying for some reason about \"moving\".  I decided against calling him out because I don't care, which leads to the next event: not liking his consequences whilst IC.\n\nHe creates a sitiation where my character get shot in the head, which I play out.  Since she is a bioweapon, she is stunned by this as her wounds regenerate which incapacitates her.  After his character kills the assailant, he checks her and realizes that the wound is closed even tho the bullet went through, but she is actually alive.   He knows she is alive, so instead of taking her to the hospital, he takes her to the police department and proceeds to: carry her in a fleece while she is blood, drop her on top of the reception desk, explain to a fellow cop that she is dead.  \n\nI responded by having a higher ranking officer yell at him, see she is alive and proceed to try to save her life.  He doesn't like this, he says its fictional and this should be fine, but it's not.  He said he wanted to see this path, found it hilarious at first, but just wanted to see what I would post even though I warned him this is a bad path to take.   After a huge argument, he decides to go back to edit his posts and I do the same, except we need to go back several days.\n\nHe leaves the rp again, in the middle of the night while I am asleep.  He says that he knows I can reply in 10 minutes, so why havent I? I must not be interested.  Now, every time he has done this removal purpose, he promised me that we would discuss before he leaves and I explained my schedule and how it effects when I can reply and to just **wait** for me before doing anything.  Every time he promised, every time he broke his promise.  \n\nI tell him that I need time to prepare, because my post will be a big one and I have been very tired because of work.  He doesn't seem to understand, so I believe that he may have some form of mental illness as he seems to not understand a lot of human interaction.  So, he promises he will behave and not dick out again, but I don't believe him.  I start writing my post yesterday, while I am asleep he leaves again, says I am clearly not interested even though it has not been 24 hours since he was last readded to our rp again.  \n\nI left him a short, to the point message about his behavior.  At this point, he has left 6 times, lies to me, needs constant reassurance, cannot wait for replies even after I explained, and no matter how good his roleplay is I am just done.  \n\ntl;dr:\ninsecure player leaves discord numerous times, needs reassurance, does unrealistic things in roleplay and argues about it, leaves for a 4th time, nags for posts and when told why I can't, leaves again, gets reassurance and leaves again.  Assumes I'm not interested after 2 days and leaves again.   Pretty much done.",

            "selftext": "So I have been on different servers on a game platform. These games are pushing towards RP's. One time when I was doing an RP with a friend. (Have mentioned them before). This server was more towards a school aspect. Note on it people just talk too. So it's common to see people just chat and hangout and not RP. \n\nSo while doing the RP a girl came up to me and my friend. In our RP we were fighting evil clones of ourselves and other friends. So it was pretty stressful  for us. So this girl comes up, and she asks us our names. We talk a bit before the evil clones find us. Then she just says that she does not like to RP. So we stopped talking to her because she not likely would  have no interest. Also, at this part the clones found us. We start fighting and since we were in the open people thought we were weird and were commenting about our RP. Just saying how it was (and there was a lot of people there). \n\nAnother time is on a different server based on Harry Potter. I don't have frequent friends that play anymore. (I used to and now I RP with their characters but I do everything ).  So people can see me typing everything in chat and I don't think anything of it. And sure, sometimes I get someone who wants to RP.  But then I have people commenting on how I RP. They don't even talk to me but just say things about how I RP. Like how it is weird when I just talk to myself. Also, a few times there are just people that sit around and talk. They don't RP at all which I can't make them but when your at a specific place (like a Harry Potter RP) their talking makes it hard to follow a RP. \n\nSorry if this was long I just really think this is a problem and want to get it off my chest.",
