            "selftext": "... from carrying this scene.\n\ni have character M and A, X isn't mine.\n\nThe characters are trapped in a small apartment building with two floors. We're doing a zombie rp with a bit of a twist and right now, there's a gang outside that's been tracking them for a while because M, A and X killed some of their buddies. X, who is my partner's character, is a rampaging mutant creature that's very territorial and there's tons of commotion downstairs as two gang members snuck in, which is where M is trying to take X so that they can escape while A keeps the baddies outside at bay until they're safe. \n\nI'm writing like... Massive paragraphs, full of things to react to: people downstairs, M is trying to urge X to be quiet and go downstairs quickly, shouting outside between the gang and A, tension building-\n\nAnd i get one sentence on how X tries getting on the roof for some reason?\n\nFirst of all: X and M are in a hallway in the second floor of the building and it's not exposed or anything, so??? Is he just busting through the roof? Or is he running to the balcony A is on? Which will in turn probably get A shot?\n\nSecond: really? One sentence? There's so much going on???? I'd be happy even with some inner monologue!\n\nThey aren't a bad rper or anything, but the second I get a small event going, I get shit replies. Like, if it's not interesting, add something?? Or say something?? Like... How do I build on one sentence? That doesn't even make sense?! \n\nIdk if my partner frequents this sub or not so I'll take this post down eventually... i just had to vent, omg.\n\nAnyways, back to carrying the scene I guess.",

            "selftext": "I've been looking for a certain rp for more than a year now. Its an au for a fandom that has, yknow, characters already made.\n\nI've had three people in the last two days that havent worked out for this certain rp.\n\nThe problem is that I'm looking for a specific character that people usually REALLY like to play as because he's the dark and edgy yet anxious type that worries about others. The fandom version of this character is one of those characters that have been corrupted into a sensitive uwu soft boy so Im already asking for a lot for them just to be in character. They always either go way too edgy or way too sensitive.\n\nThe other problem is that I play as the sort of villain  of the canon (even though he's not, really, its just that his character is very, I dont know, pushy?) And so people like to treat him like he kills babies in his spare time or something.\n\nI'm not only looking to play this character, but I play a lot of side characters too, in order for the story to progress naturally.\n\n1st person:\nI send the starter. Things are going fine. They are the type that plays the character very sensitive. Whatever. Theres no other interaction that they should have with the 'bad' guy, so I have another character being very bothered and literally almost crying be near them.\n\nSince they were playing the sensitive type, I thought they would be drawn to others sensitivity in order for them to interact.\n\nInstead they godmod my character to come back so that they can talk more.\n\nNo, I'm out.\n\n2nd person:\nCan somehow automatically tell that my character is up to no good even though they really had no reason to believe so.\n\nWheres the conflict? No. I'm out.\n\n3rd Person:\nI actually put up a paragraph of disclaimers of what not to do. I.e dont act like my character kills babies and take a fucking hint when another character is around and mine is not.\n\nThey start by already pushing it by making this canon character trans without asking me. Some people might think I'm transphobic or whatever for wanting to be asked permission for this, but its just different when its a canonical character that is in no way implied to be that way. (Also, I just really dont like the story element that comes with it, because the scenes of dysphoria and coming out are absolutely unavoidable and Ive played through them so many times.)\n\nI didn't care anyway, I let it slide, whatever. So my character is trying to speak to them. They dont want to talk to him. Their character makes it extremely obvious that they want no interaction with ANY character.\n\nNo. I'm out.\n\nFor fuck sake I just want a competent person to rp my stupid goddamn idea with.",
