            "selftext": "I understand why these groups exist.  You know, the ones that you have to submit writing samples to join?  I get tired of receiving RP requests from clearly illiterate people so it'd be kind of nice if I could look for partners in a place where everyone is guaranteed to have at least some skill.\n\nSo I get it.  It's a nice idea.\n\nThe problem is that every one of these groups seem to be run by assholes who don't actually know anything about grammar or good prose.\n\nEarlier today I submitted an application to one such Discord group and was rejected for mixing tenses.  (I write in past tense, and she was saying parts of my sentences were written in present tense.)  I was dumbfounded, asked for clarification, and the person who evaluated my writing sample pointed out a few examples to me.  Again I didn't understand.  I googled, saw a few grammar sites saying that the words in question could be used in past tense.  I pointed this out to her.  She said it was still too confusing.\n\nI know I'm not a perfect writer, but looking at the samples of people who had passed the evaluation, I didn't see how they were any better.  One, in fact, was quite bad.\n\nSo I grabbed a chapter from one of my favorite books, edited the names of the characters to match my characters (that were in my previous sample) and submitted it to the group.  \n\nIt was rejected because the story was \"too choppy\" and didn't \"flow.\"  (Which is not true in any way.  The author I used wrote beautiful prose.)\n\nI informed the admin of the Discord group that she had rejected a published author and even linked her to the original so she could see for herself how little I changed in case she didn't believe me.  \n\n[Her reaction was underwhelming,](https://i.imgur.com/BNCUNlV.png) and I'm sure the admin and mods of the group will find a way to justify their behavior to themselves.",

            "selftext": "So, just a small story here... I've been approached for RP by someone. They were polite about it, clearly enthusiastic about the play and even came up with an idea of their own! Thing is... the person's writing wasn't quite enough for me. Frequent grammar/spelling mistakes, lacking punctuation, basic vocabulary and so on. The person's response length was also much less than what I personally prefer to go for, so there was most certainly a conflict of interests and preferences. I'm a bit picky regarding that stuff, admittedly. People might be new at this and still learning, but I want to enjoy myself when I'm playing out a scene. It's smut RP we're speaking of, so reading and replying to well-written post is where the joy is at, for me. \n\nWith all that in mind, I've declined the person's approach and told them this won't work out. I didn't do so in a rude way, either. I was trying to be as kind about it as I possibly could, seeing just how passionate and willing to play the person was! Said that our styles aren't aligning, that we're after different pacing of the RP, that we wouldn't have too great of a time together. Even apologised for upsetting them, if I somehow did! This is where we should respectfully agree to part ways and both look for something that'll leave both of us more satisfied with the RP at the end of it, right? No. The person decided to just send me a reply along the lines of \"dont worry... nvm... cya\" after my apology and logged off the RP platform we were both logged onto.\n\nHave I in any way deserved this sort of treatment? :c",

            "selftext": "Alright so just a heads up this happened several months ago so I might not remember anything but I remember the jist of it.\n\nSo a few months ago I had been looking for a particular canon character to go against my OC. It was an AU so while many things were kept canon (gotta be able to recognize the universe after all) there were some stuff that was changed. Not immediately but it would have taken place over time. A lot of things were kept very slow burn which is fine because I dig that.\n\nAnyway after a couple of years (and SEVERAL disappointments because people are ass and ghost all the time) I find a potential partner. I cant remember how it came up but I ended up explaining that I had been looking for a particular character for some time but was never able to get them. And when I was they always left after 2 posts.\n\nPerson: \"well maybe they wouldn't leave if your plot ideas weren't shit. Not shiting on your character but your ideas are bad.\"\n\n\"Your really stupid if you think something like that is going to work. You're an idiot.\" \n\n\"It would be better if you went with my idea because yours is so dumb *lists something I've never been into* (among some other things)\n\nAfter that I just had enough. I REALLY wanted something to work out but they made me feel like an idiot and combined with the constant ghosting I was just done. It's been months and I'm still really angry about it. Of course I told them what was what because that really pissed me off and I legit fired back \"if you weren't such a needy prude maybe you'd have better luck finding a partner.\" And them left after sending that. I realize I'm not any better saying that but it needed said. I hate it when people treat me like dirt like that. Ghosting? Whatever they're not going to reply back anyway so why bother. They're not worth the time. But if they're still talking to me and treating me like that? No GTFO. I dont deal with assholes.\n\nIt's safe to say I haven't gone back. That whole experience ruined it for me. It ruined my already worn down self esteem from the ghosting. I realize that not everyone's like that and I wish I had met those people beforehand. And I'm really sad I was never able to find a good partner (and yes before anyone asks I did try my hand at other rp's not just this one but they didnt work out either).\n\nAnyway I had to get that out. Sorry if it seems like I'm complaining but after several months it had to come out. Thanks to them I've completely given up on roleplaying. If people are just going to treat me like that by either ghosting or treating me like shit I'm just not going to bother putting myself out there anymore. I guess what really weighs on me is I wanted this so bad for so long only to have it crash down on me like that really sucks.",

And every time he replies it would always be a new character here and there, worse, he would then rely on me to help make said character reply for him instead of him writing his own replies. Therefore making me assume the added character's role. \n\nI'm so goddamn tired of this. I've talked it out with him a couple times before, but it would end up with him adding in MORE characters from different games and such, then make me assume the role. The latest so far is are the T-Dolls from Girls' Frontline, and there would probably be more coming in for the forseeable future.",

It can be a nice starting point when asking 'Is your character evil, is he good?' and to get a little overview.\n\nBut some people seem to forget that most characters have more than one personality trait, or use their character's alignment to justify the stupid decisions their characters make.\n\n I often encounter the same reactions/hobbies with totally different characters, with different life experiences (who just happen to share the alignment lawful evil for example), because their writers base these reactions on some funny memes they saw. And after a while, it gets a little annoying. \n\nSome of these characters who are so heavily based on alignment charts almost feel like totally flat characters, because they can never change in any way or grow. If you tell their writer 'Wait, isn't that reaction that is a little bit over the top?', they will go on a rant that this is just their characters alignment, as if being chaotic neutral means that people can't think about the possible outcome of their actions anymore. \n\nEven if you play chaotic neutral, you should take into account if your character is supposed to be intelligent, for example. What are your opinions, does this bother you?",
