            "selftext": "So- I was roleplaying with this guy on discord in the DMS.  \n\n\nIt was an uh... kinda NSFW RP (Keep in mind- the server I advertised on was for ADULTS ONLY. AND THE AMOUNT OF BAD GRAMMAR HE HAS POSTED ON THERE MAKES ME WONDER HOW I DIDN'T SEE IT BEFORE.) My character, an escaped half-dragon (mostly for the appearance of having horns, and a tail don't @ me.) who was enslaved for three years offscreen prior to the RP. (Most that happened to be his character disguised as a naked woman who appeared to be beaten and dying.)  I put up an ad saying that I was looking for at least a paragraph, and to fill up the paragraph space (With terrible grammar and spelling mind you.) he pulled possibly the dumbest shit I had ever seen in my at least eight months of RPing by then.\n\nSo basically- my character is being dragged away by guards, and then he decides \"I need to fill up space on my post!\" and proceeds to make my rather feisty, angry, character... who would try to rip off the flesh of anything that touched her... act like a coward, and a classic distressed damsel rather than a literal beast- which was what I had been portraying her as thus far. Turns out- he didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to take control of another person's character, and when I called him out on it, what was his fucking excuse?  \n\n\n\"Oh, I didn't want you to ruin the plot!\"  \n\n\nTo which... I had to call him out on again... by telling him the most obvious rule for RPing... is that RP is a two-way street.   \n\n\nFor those of you who somehow stumbled on this subreddit- here are a few general rules of when you're rping, NSFW or not.  \n\n\n1: Do not do anything that goes against what was agreed upon. If your partner didn't agree to have their character kidnapped/mutilated/killed/etc, don't do it.  \n\n\n2: Do not control other people's characters. You can do it for memes in OOC channels if its with a group you're comfortable with, but don't play as another user's character. It's not cool, and it's a dick move.\n\n3: Do not... and I mean- do not- metagame, god mod, or powerplay.   \n\n\nMetagaming is when you take out of character knowledge, and then plop it into your RP, acting like your character knows it when they haven't learned it in that RP yet. For example, You're told out of character or by looking at Sally's reference sheet that she's terrified of water, a glass of it being splashed on her could throw her into a panic attack. So then you splash water on her face to try to send her into a panic attack... Don't be this dude.  \n\n\nGod Modding... This is basically when your character suddenly becomes a god and then does whatever the fuck they want.\n\nPowerplay- the best way I can sum it up is that you have a character, and then you go around saying that he's better than everyone else's and that he's stronger, faster, or whatever else. Don't be this dude either, he sucks.  \n\n\nSo aside from that: I'm a magnet for weirdos, I have more horror stories when it comes to roleplaying, but none that really should get their own post. This one stuck out to me because this guy was so blatant with trying to insinuate that I don't know how to rp, and that he somehow 'knew' how to play my character 'better' for the rp. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say- the RP was called off by me, because the number of times he did weird shit in the RP, or dumb shit, or just being an idiot, in general, was actually starting to spark up my anger issues on top of moving at the time.  \n\n\nSo there you have it- a story of a bad Roleplayer. Because that's what this subreddit is for.",

Sorry in advance! This is going to be a long one.\n\nI've been RPing for more than 12 years. I've seen not only my writing develop, but also my roleplay skills (i.e. building a plot, giving my partners lots to work with, being engaging). I often find myself in situations where I'm pleasing the other person, never the other way around, and maybe you could tell me to avoid them but this is all people want to do.\n\nWhat I mean is: I'm very good at playing dominant males or smart, sensual women. I can be anything in between or beyond, but people only want these archetypes. I find that with females who like to play female characters or submissive male characters, they adore me. With male roleplayers who only play male characters, they also adore me and have intricate plans for fetishizing my character with zero intent on building a story.\n\nI don't have to play these types of characters all the time--hell, I want to do something different for once, but this is just what people want. It's either this or no roleplaying at all. It's so rare to find it the other way around, AND for the person to be a good writer. Typos and grammatical errors here and there don't mean anything to me (I do it all the time), so I'm hoping I'm not coming off too strict here.\n\nAside from character roles, I'm always leading the story, I'm always building the plots... In my roleplays, I give my partners choices within the story itself. The decisions they make will change how my characters react and how the story will develop. Sounds like how it should be right? Nothing special? So why don't other people do the same for me?\n\nI'm just tired. I'm sad because I love to roleplay but I'm always disappointed. I find that the only \"enjoyment\" I get out of it is when my partners gush over me and love my characters to death... But I know it's only because I give them what they want. The novelty of being admired wears off pretty fast.\n\nI just wish I could enjoy a roleplay for *me*. Of course, I want my partner to still like me/my character and get something out of it too but damn it... I just want to not have to carry all the time.\n\nRoleplaying shouldn't have to make me sad, but it does. I'm on-and-off with it, getting exhausted by my disappointment and setting it aside before getting hopeful enough to try again. At this point, I feel like quitting for good, but the thought of doing that makes me feel like a quitter, and frankly, even sadder.\n\nI just don't know what to do.",
