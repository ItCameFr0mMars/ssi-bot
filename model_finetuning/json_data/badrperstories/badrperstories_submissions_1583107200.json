            "selftext": "this is my first post here, sorry if it doesn't belong-\n\nSo i've been online RPing for like... 2 years now? I'll really do anything, like survival. Like this one RP.\n\nThere were some warning signs with the admin of this RP. I should have paid larger attention to them aha but i'm dumb so I didn't. I'd make a joke in the discussion about how two characters were interacting and they'd swoop in and correct me on how the interaction was going. And then continue to insult my character. I'd be fine with this if they were joking but like... no. All of the joking we did in chat was wasted on them because they just couldn't understand that we weren't serious.\n\nThen there was the second warning that I missed. My one character was extremely over-dramatic, and would make threats in the heat of the moment. They were just like that. Well, in the discussion after my character made threats (not injuring, just throwing words around) the admin had to tell me 'I was going over board' and 'causing useless drama.' Their character, the leader of the group, had announced something without consulting the rest of the group. So mine reacted the way they would based on their personality.\n\nI tried to tell them that it was just them saying things. They weren't going OP and hurting them, they were just throwing around threats they would forget they made in like an hour. But no. The admin still had to tell me that it was sTiLl A bAd ThInG. \n\nThen the third sign. My character had been kicked out for threatening the leader and had then decided they were going to stalk the group out of malice. Someone else went over to interact with mine. Guess what happens in the discussion?\n\n'Unnamed, you shouldn't interact with them. You will be kicked out of the group.' We both tried to explain to them that it was for drama because the RP was moving painfully slow, and they still insisted that Unnamed remove their post and not interact with me. \n\nThe final straw happened when shit hit the fan in the RP. The admin's character was kicking people out of their gang left and right and other characters, including my own, were arguing with them. Guess who posted in chat crying about how we were all so mean and needed to chill? \n\nYep. Keep in mind, this is coming from the person who was threatening to kick people out if they dared interact with me. They had their characters constantly screaming slurs at mine and thinking about how horrible they were. But how dare the other characters even think of *questioning* their overlord? \n\nI'll admit I'm pretty dense so after they posted &gt;with their character threatening everyone else of course&lt; I typed up a reply about how mine brought up valid points. They were pointing out the flaws and pretty much ripping into the leader with their argument &gt;yeah, not my smartest move-&lt;  when the admin threw a fit. \n\nThey posted 'That's it! I'm done! All my characters are dead and Unnamed can be the leader!'  They continued to block me so I couldn't post on the RP anymore. \n\nTheir one mistake being, although they blocked me, they had their friend create the RP Thread. so i could still post and RP with everyone else.  But yeah. We were all sort of stunned that they just couldn't handle normal roleplay drama and we eventually had to wait for the co-owner to come on just for the thing to be cancelled because the previous admin was flooding their PMs talking about how mean we all were.\n\nsorry if this really wasn't that exciting- i just need to vent. basically someone had a character abusing their power and was sort of being a jerk in chat and couldn't handle it when the others started to fight back.",

            "selftext": "So, I have quite a few account on a few apps and sites, but this one is a very popular typically used for game chat.\n\nFunnily enough, one of the people I met here on Reddit (I doubt she\u2019ll see this, but she knows who she is) suggested me to a group chat (Basically a Futanari Hooters that serves meals and various kinks that the customers may have) and I was invited in and offered a choice:\n\n1) Be one of the Servers (meaning should your character be male they are forcefully turned into a Futanari, not only that, they are forcefully injected with something that lets the Owner and Customer change your appearance at will) and said injection would give your character the ability to cum on command.\n\nTL;DR, Taking full control of your character.\n\nOr 2) Be one of the Customers, having to earn multiple part-time \u201cpasses\u201d (once used, you can\u2019t participate in being served until you get another pass) before being able to convert them into full-time passes (you get one session with a waitress/waitresses daily). Which doesn\u2019t sounds so bad, until you understand how the Owner (who is also the head of the server) gave out said passes.\n\nIn most cases, once you joined and have actively participated in chat, you were given one free pass... So great!\n\nBut now comes the fun part:\n\nShe would lock out winning passes to Customers behind random Q&amp;A\u2019s about herself (basically impossible to answer things that no one knew about her), \u201cminigames\u201d like \u201cI have _____ for this console, play me and win and I\u2019ll give you a pass.\u201d Which would all be fine, if they were regular, weekly occurrences, but she was always so random and sporadic with them, that people could literally go weeks without earning a pass (if they even bothered trying).\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even related to what just recently occurred!\n\nI like to think of myself as very open-minded, especially sexually (I\u2019m usually of the mindset that I\u2019ll try something at least once) but I\u2019ve interacted with people in the Blacked/Snowbunny communities and have such a foul taste in my mouth from the little glimpses I\u2019ve had (to me, the mentality of \u201cbreeding out the whites\u201d is incredibly racist, and if a white woman or man said they\u2019d try to \u201cbreed out the blacks\u201d people would pull the racist card IMMEDIATELY) and I\u2019d learned that my close friend and mutual was actively in the community being used by these \u201cbulls\u201d I was pissed and needed to vent, so I came to the group chat.\n\nOnly to be met by one of the members indirectly (but still insinuating that me and the other members) were stupid, to which I briefly left the chat because it had ended up being toxic.\n\nWeeks later I join back, only to be quizzed in why I left, explaining everything I\u2019ve listed above as problems and the Owner basically said:\n\n\u201cIt may be racist, but we have to allow those kinks in case someone here likes it.\u201d\n\nSo I reply with something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re allowing people to willingly indulge in an inherently racist kink and doing absolutely nothing to stop it?\u201d\n\nTo which she\u2019d repeated herself and tacked on the infamous title of this post.\n\nEventually she\u2019d kicked me from the group, to which I said good riddance, but fuck man... Never thought that someone would try to defend racist kinks as \u201cKinkshaming.\u201d \ud83d\ude15",

And for those who are doing it with their partners, for the love of Christ, cease those vexatious antics at once. Think about how they look forward on how the story developed, the ideas and characters they put a lot of effort to, the excitement and happiness they felt when someone are interested to be their partner before you shrugged them off like nothing happens.",

It's been a while since I've written on this subreddit, but if you're familiar with what I write about, it's either bad RP'ers, or bad RP games.\n\nI'm sure you've heard of this game before, if you're somewhat familiar with RP games on ROBLOX, or you've seen examples of it, such as some clips in the series \"ROLEPLAYERS ON ROBLOX.\"\n\nThe game does control nicely, though the music gets a little repetitive. But it's not the map, or the music, or even the controls that are the issue: It's the actual Role players themselves.\n\nThere's only 3 good RP'ers on the game as far as I know, and all 3 of them were RP'ers from a different RP game. If you want an example of what kind of RHS RP'er I'm taling about, here's an idea:\n\nSam/Is kind/half demon/half angle(Note: The spelling was probably done wrong)/Silent/cute\n\nIt's those kind of RP'ers that make a sterotype of RP'ers on ROBLOX: All of them just play Adopt Me, RHS, or Royale High.

I've lost interest in roleplaying despite numerous attempts to rekindle it with a friend. Burn out has massacred any chance for some kind of roleplay that could've produced an awesome storyline. I don't know what to do, and each time we try to figure out a problem, there's just no solution whatsoever/newer problems, like constantly apologizing and being uninterested; as we only have 2 interests in common so we try to do those to keep the other satisfied, but it never seems to work. I know I shouldn't be doing this, but I accept any rp idea to at least escape any boredom and hopefully regain that spark but it's not working. I don't know what to do. It's just a constant cycle of doing nothing and apologizing too much. Maybe it's my partner not giving much besides one sentence that has like 5 words in it or the lack of depth at times, but I just don't want to hurt them since I can come off as rather blunt and rude if I do say something. What's the reasonable thing to do here? (Sorry if this is all smashed together and seems incoherent. If anyone can actually read this properly and interpret what I'm saying, then kudos to you!)",

Been having several RP partners throughout the years but one of them have stuck for almost all of these and well, there in lays the trouble. \n\nWhen we started RP I was kind of a newcomer to it all so I never knew where to put down my limits. They had more experience and this created a power dynamic where they were the ones pulling the strings: they made up the plots, world build, character dynamics, events ext. I take some blame for just meekly going along and there's only so much I can push onto the \u201cI was a newcomer how was I supposed to know?\u201d card. \n\nBut this changed with time: I found other RP partners and started to take more charge of what I played. This is also about the time where I picked up a clear pattern in their characters. Almost exclusively they were brooding, tragic, overly dramatic ass holes that were rude to everyone and everything. It got so bad that I started to develop a mental bingo every time they wished to introduce another character. \n\nOur RP's started to really diminish in quality and it seems to correlate with me not putting up with all of their plot ideas. Too each their own on what one finds comfortable to RP but I myself am not a fan of playing out things like sexual assault/molestation ext. This RP:er had dragged me through one of those and that was enough for me to put down my foot and say \u201cnever doing that again!\u201d. \n\nThe RP's we've had for the past 2 \u2013 3 years have been so stagnated. Either I have to play a \u201cyes\u201d sayer: a character who never goes against them, who always kiss their ass no matter how terribly their character behaves and who should just shut up and be thankful. If I, in a moment of purely being done with that bullshit, introduce characters who challenges them, who doesn't just flop over on their belly as soon as their character sneezes, the entire role-play comes to a screeching halt. It has gotten to the point where I've stopped using my most favoured characters with them: there's no point in using those that I adore when I know they'll either be constantly shat on or called \u201cbullies\u201d because they didn't do what this persons character wanted. \n\nNow I'm really at the end of my rope. I know that the most logical thing to do would be to drop them like a hot potato. But there lies the trouble: we're sort of friends IRL. I've tried talking with them about it but they can be rather moody and it's hard to really read them. Any suggestions on just how to handle this?",
