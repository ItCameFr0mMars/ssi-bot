If I even think about rejecting them or saying no to them I either get blocked, whined and begged to or ranted at and blamed for the issue myself so it\u2019s usually something I avoid or ignore when it comes up. \n\nAm I the issue? I don\u2019t exactly avoid these things in the roleplay but I also don\u2019t think I put the expression out that that is what I want or something that I am looking for - as I have made very clear when I make any kind of AD or post looking for partners in the past.

            "selftext": "So I joined a Discord RP server a while ago at the behest of a person who I thought was a friend of mine (\"F\"). F asked if I would be interested in helping him mod his server since he knew I was pretty good at keeping my own servers in line. This server is small and okay-ish? Essentially it's a Carnival Row rip off without the conflict and more modern, I don't have a problem with it at all, it's pretty okay but within a few months I began to really notice something in regards to a few things: \n\n&gt;1. How F manages his server and his moderators.  \n2. His undisclosed list of what is and isn't considered a cryptid. \n\nI'll get to the first part: as a moderator in a smaller server there really isn't much to do. There was one person who wanted to be a huge drama whore but they left on break and was refused entry back into the server once they left. I tried to be active everyday between work and managing my home, and also posting \"ads\" on their advertisement tumblr blog when I was able to be on my PC. However, I was pulled aside by F and another Admin and told that I wasn't being active at all, that I wasn't performing the duties required as a mod, and that a different server I had created for another person and I from that same server (we clicked really well writing wise and OOC-wise). \n\nF was dictating that anything I roleplayed about in that side server needed to be moved into the main server because if it was taking away from my activity it wasn't worth having. This seemed to be hammered in by Admin 2 because she insinuated that I didn't really care about the Server since I didn't do what was required of me and that I wasn't active in actual threads since I was taking way too long to respond to two plot important threads.\n\nMind you this entire thing took play from 2 am-4 am EST because they cause my panic disorder to pop up because they were vague about it until they were both ready to talk to me.\n\nAnyways it was agreed that, fine, I would check the server as often as I was able and move any relevant things to the main server, but only with the stipulation that the requirements for the server moderation were stated somewhere: there were no rules or lists of what was actually required of the mods. F had me join, but never gave me any notion that moderation duties involved more than being active, keeping peace, and queuing up ads on tumblr.\n\nNot long after, F changed all the account passwords without my knowing and refused to respond to me. I requested Admin 2 to demote me to a regular player because I don't feel that being ghosted like that as an admin is appropriate behavior. \n\nNow on to the second issue I'm running into: the vagueness of terms in what is a \"cryptid\" and what isn't. \n\nNow, the types of characters we have so far are Fae, Vampires, Werewolves, a Dragon, Centaurs of various sorts, Humans, Selkies, and a Harpy. So when F's rules clearly point out \"no cryptids allowed\" I figured \"Okay, we can't play any of the famous bois like Bigfoot or Mothman or anything okay.\" \n\nNope.\n\nF gets to determine if a character's species is too much like a cryptid to be allowed in the server. For reference I have a bat person who doesn't know if she has any others like herself, I was going to place her in the server because she's adorable and figured why not? F quickly said \"sounds too much like a cryptid.\"\n\nThis, albeit little, makes me more than a little upset since anything other than humans are considered cryptids by definition:\n\n&gt;an animal (such as Sasquatch or the Loch Ness Monster) that has been claimed to exist but  never proven to exist Contrary to popular belief, **cryptids** don't have to be supernatural, mythical or even all that strange\u2014though many popular creatures acquire these characteristics as their legends grow.\u2014 \n\nSo this includes all approved species so far? To me it feels like F has a very specific list of species he wants in this server, but has not posted it even when the concept was made with the beginnings of the server or the tumblr account. \n\nThis is a really long post, sorry about that, but this shit has been bothering the shit out of me for ages and while I am going to leave the server eventually I'm staying for a good friend of mine who was also pulled into the server as a moderator.",

I lurk this sub and you guys get some wacky antics, and unfortunately, I, u/why_so_annoyed_tho, am on the receiving end of some very wacky, and honestly upsetting antics this time around.\n\nSo, this story starts about a month-ish ago. I'm just having a grand time. Listening to music, going through my 1x1s and dropping quality replies left, right and center. Then, one of my roleplay partners messages me and says: &gt;!Hey, I'm horny rn. How about some instructions? !&lt;\n\n...er, what?\n\nYeah, you read that one right. He's just done upped and asked me that. *Naturally*, I **hoped** it wasn't for me and it was a misclick or just went to the wrong person. Spoiler alert: **NOPE**, it was meant for me. I politely declined and asked him not to ever ask such things from me again. Because, you know... it's pretty weird? It's been calm since. Until a few days ago.\n\nI wake up earlier than I usually do, and I hop on to read some of the roleplay that my pals left me over night. I grab myself some milk and just enjoy my cold beverage while reading. Ping.\n\nDiscord message! Oooh, it's my roleplay friend. I wonder what funny meme he's sending me now!\n\n&gt;!Hey, can we talk about sucking cock while you call me a faggot!&lt; yeah I dunno man, that's a bit too fucking much? Thanks, I guess?????\n\nFor context; I don't do smut. I didn't hint at smut. No, I don't hit on people OOC, that's just cringe. This was just me drinking milk and getting this shit. I honestly don't know what to think about this kinda shit. He apologized about it and said how he's irrational when he just wakes up (lol?????) but that was just fucked up and wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, dudes and dudettes.

            "selftext": "Hello all. This is my first post here. So this is something of a rant because I\u2019m pretty irritated. I\u2019d also love input on how best to handle the situation.\n\nI posted online trying to find a roleplay partner several days ago, had some great responses but one in particular that just fit perfectly. We worked out an amazing storyline and have been world building for days - so far the roleplay has been excellent.\n\nThe issue came in our OOC chat. At the start, I told him I didn\u2019t want to discuss religion or politics. I ended up sharing my faith because he was genuinely interested and very respectful - no judgement or aggression. Which was great.\n\nTonight we were roleplaying, and he made a political comment, I replied saying I believed it wasn\u2019t quite the way he had made it seem (the political situation he was referring to), and then reminded him that I didn\u2019t want to discuss politics.\n\nHe began to attack me, insisting that I explicitly share my political views and saying that if I politically supported XX that (implies) we can\u2019t be friends because XX was against his very existence. I was astonished to say the least, that he would judge what my political views were based on a non specific comment, and then attack me for it. I\u2019m still shaking my head.\n\nI basically told him that he was being totally ridiculous, and that I hadn\u2019t even shared my views that he was simply presuming what they were and that I was getting offline until he decided if he wanted to apologize and continue our friendship/roleplay or not.\n\nHis response to that, was basically demanding to know what my views are, and that he was sorry it got heated (not that he attacked me). He implied that I was the one who needed to calm down.\n\nI\u2019m just mind blown. Especially since I made it so clear at the onset (as well as several times since) that politics were a no-go subject. I\u2019m just... astonished. In all my years of roleplay experience, I\u2019ve never dealt with this particular situation. Ugh! It seems likely that this partnership will fall apart, because I don\u2019t think he is going to accept that I refuse to discuss politics now that he assumes that I believe differently than him. Which sucks, because the roleplay was excellent. \n\n*Sigh*",

            "selftext": "So, me and my friend were worldbuilding here and there. We'd share ideas, charas and stuff. Now, do take note that my friend isnt a good RPer and I'm basically giving him a chance and helping him out, lest the past will repeat itself just like from my old and unfinished series in this SubReddit.\n\nBut one time, he showed me a character and her bio and... well... I'll let you peeps take a look. \n\nBy the way, this is a rough and summarized translation of the bio, since it was sent to me on our mother tongue.\n\nCharacters:\nPatch - the main focus of this post\nGunner - Patch's guardian\nEdge - another one of Patch's guardian\n\n\n\nEnter Patch. \n\nPatch is my friend's self-insert reincarnated from a future dystopic world where only a few remain.\nA baby Patch was found by Gunner lying on a flower patch. Gunner decided to take care of it.\n\nFast forward to 10 years.\nDespite her age, Patch was declared as an absolute genius though was mentally unstable. During that time, certain NPC's placed Patch on the frontlines, which was certainly suicide. Gunner aint having that and rescued her while the NPC's were \"tortured until they begged for mercy\".\n \n(You know... instead of reprimanding what's left of your manpower?)\n\nAnyway, fast forward 7 years!\nOnly a handful of their group was left and other were dying here and there. Their group decided to elect a new leader and Patch was declared as their new leader. \n\n(Of course, there will always be some peeps who disagreed so I asked him about it. His response?)\n\n\"The ones who disagreed or were against her lead were killed and tortured.\"\n\n(bruh)\n \n\"And one of them was her closest friend who then betrayed their group when Patch became leader.\"\n\n(b r u h)\n\nSo to continue, when Patch became leader, Edge decided to \"test\" Patch by taking her to... my friend's self-insert's grave (with a sword sticking on it). Now then, Edge's test was... insulting Patch with a few words. With Patch's rush of emotions, she pulled out the sword on the grave: a feat no others can do. So then, they fought for, as my friend stated, 5 hours. As expected, Patch won and Edge, knowing she passed whatever that test was, turned into a weapon (another sword) for Patch to use...\n\n(what even?)\n\nSince then, Patch has lead continuous victories against the enemy and eventually, they all won and peace was back. \n\nIt was also stated that Patch doesnt smile anymore since \"emotions get in the way of their campaigns\".\n\n\n\nAnd that was it. I called him out on this since I feel it was way too much glorifying the character and comes off as a Mary Sue. He said that \"he couldnt make characters like he used to on the past\". I let his reason slide and told him that guides exist around the Internet, since reading her bio screwed me up big time. \n\nI have yet to see Patch in an actual RP (and I hope I wont) and hopefully, he'll revise her bio to a more believable and less-glorifying one.",

Don't get me wrong, I like a little fun sometimes. That is no problem, not everything has to be tragic or creepy all the time. \n\nBut she will often use jokes that are...very unfitting. 200 year old characters who do not know the most common things in the world (even though they spent their whole life in this world, surrounded by people and it is impossible that they would not know about them) just so she can include a funny scene with this character asking a 'funny' question. Or she will have her loyal/dutiful character leave his task so that he can have some fun, and if I tell her that this is not really reliable behavior (which is a character trait of this character) she just answers with oh but it was funny and nothing happened anyway, he had fun once he is still super reliable. She is really not amused if I tell her that this behavior might have consequences.\n\nOr she will ask 'if my character x and your character y would meet, would it not be super funny if x would insult him? What a funny scene that will be, we should write it.' (my character is very powerful and views people like her character as disposable). So I answer that she should not try it if she does not want her character to die, and she is pissed of that I can't just 'make it work'. Or that my characters would react really offended when being insulted by random strangers instead of finding it as funny as she does.\n\nOtherwise, the rp is good, but every time she wants to include this scenes I have to tell her 'no' and it really makes me feel like a villain...it would be okay if it would be only with the characters who are more of a comic relief character, but I have the feeling that if I agree to her ideas my powerful characters will come of as someone no one can take seriously.",

The guy just became toxic and there were times where I just stopped RPing with him just to cool off and not to get into an argument with him. There were even times where I purposely didn't go on cause I felt like we were gonna get into an argument and we were never gonna finish a story.

The most significant RP time in my life that I remember is when I ran an account for my Star Wars OC, Hyde. He was and still is one of my best characters. I met very talented, original, and artistic people during this time. But I also experienced a few horror stories. Even one where one player would not stop harassing my character and his friends. But at least even then, he played by the rules despite being a complete asshole. But one that stood out to me so strongly is the worst God Mobber I\u2019ve ever seen throughout my entire time of role playing. Hyde was a very strong (maybe even a little overpowered) character, but I always made sure to give everyone a fighting chance. He still had his weaknesses, and I let people take advantage of them since Hyde was so strong. It\u2019s only fair. The game would be no fun if I didn\u2019t. I always let my partner get a few hits at Hyde if they were fighting and I definitely let Hyde miss a few times and I DEFINITELY MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT tell my partner what happens to their character or what there character is going to do. This girl that I was partnered with... did. I hated it so much. She told ME how her actions affected Hyde and wouldn\u2019t let me block her attacks even if I said he would. It got so bad that I ended up having to overkill her. I did not hold back and just eventually had had enough of her so I just killed her. I don\u2019t usually kill my partners character (unless it was established beforehand) and I think that was the first time I had to do it. It was such a frustrating event that I remember it so clearly... this was 4-5 years ago.",

I've had so many kids come into my server trying to \"flex\" that they've been role playing for anywhere from 3 months to 3 years and each time acting like that's this massive amount of time and I should be so lucky to reach that length of time with my own experience.   \n\n\nThen it inevitably comes out that I've been text based role playing for 19 years and the *disbelief* I get never fails to amuse me. And I'm not even the oldest person in my server. There's some people who started when they were preteens, like me, who are in their 50s and 60s now.   \n\n\nIt's come up a few times that a lot of the new generation of role players seem to think their generation somehow invented the concept of text based RP. We've been doing this online since there's been internet. We play adults. It's no different than writing, especially since many of us don't do ERP. Not only has text-based RP existed since commercialized internet, but role playing in general can be traced back to the 1970s with the rise of D&amp;D or even as far back as collaborative storytelling in ancient civilizations.   \n\n\nI really don't understand how some kids are out here like \"derp, this is only something lil bebs do, and anyone older than me is dumb\".

            "selftext": "Ah Yes, the most talked about issue. Every here has gone through it at least once. This specific time focuses on two people who we will call Tony and Pam and we will call their characters Bret and Tina. My characters will be white a red.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTony has a host of problems that I will try to address as clearly as possible. \n\n1. Bret is never alone: When I create a post I always say \"Your OC\" or \"OC Needed.\" For the specific post. This means that you can use one OC unless I say otherwise. So Imagine my surprise when Tony Tries to invite not only his character Bret, but invite is whole fucking space army. (more on that later.)\n\n2. Everyone Fucking love Bret and Bret has to be the center of attention: Bret Controls an entire space army, consisting of more than 10 billion soldiers and units and they all love this man. Women wanna fuck him, guys wanna to be him and if you don't agree than you are an idiot.  His army has threatened to destroy my army's kingdom because he was attacked. (More on that later as well.)\n\n3. Bret is an edgy son of a bitch: My character Red gets into a little fight with Bret which is interrupted by white. White offers Bret sanctuary in her kingdom. How does Bret show thanks, Well by threatening everybody of course! He Tells his second character to shoot anyone who even looks at them funny. My character who is the literal goddess of peace, health, and love says she's hurt that he would even make such a threat. His response is he cannot trust anyone until they start kissing his feet so he's going to keep pointing his tank's 40mm cannon at single family homes for the time being.  Another instance was when the group was gathered in the throne room where Bret has a breakdown. One of his Groupies has to explain that he committed mass genocide, killing innocent men, women, and children because his wife was killed, but he feels really bad about it. So what your telling me is child killer over here lost his wife and kills everyone and my character is just suppose to be okay with that? Fuck that.\n\n4. Tony doesn't doesn't work well with others if he cant lead: I informed Tony that his army  is OP and is overshadowing the story I have created. This lead to us brainstorming some Ideas which were way fucking worse than what I could imagine. He said that his character, Bret will not lead a puppet another kingdoms army. I said he can either invite four other characters to lead if he really needs to or he can be an adviser and train my army in modern combat. Tony and all of his infinite wisdom decides to invite four characters and two whole squadrons of soldiers. On top of this when White and Bret are trying to make war strategies all he does is take over and makes plans himself and adds whatever character and equipment he wants, saying that my character knows nothing. \n\n5. Bret doesn't give a fuck about you or the world you built:  As stated before Bret is loved by his entire army like some weird fucking pet. If anything even looks at this man they will come down and destroy everything to try and capture the person responsible and they will be put on trial. Now from here one of three things will happen. 1. They are held prisoner for life, 2. They are executed, or 3. They become a sex slave. So not only does Bret disregard the laws set by the world he chose to participate in he will also choose what punishment to bring upon those who attack him. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNow on to Tina and her character Pam. My issues with Tina are not as nearly as long.\n\n1. Tina is OP: Yes the classic illness that blights a ton of RP sessions. Before we began Pam asked me what the power level of my characters  were. I told her White and red are gods who have special requirements to kill. Of course she comes in with her own god like character who never gets hit, and can never be damaged. Even my fucking character feels pain, but Pam's do not. White and Tina got into a fight and Tina could not be touched. Every attack was deflected or dodged  and every attack that landed was described as weak and my characters fingers should shatter because of it. \n\n 2. Pam is a one sentence pony: Pam never rights more than one sentence and that one sentence is usually dialogue. Here's an example. \n\nMe: Writes paragraphs of detail describing the world around her. \n\nTina: Smiles \"This is nice.\"\n\nAnd it will literally go on like this for days.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAt this point Im thinking about calling it quits. I am not having fun anymore.",

            "selftext": "I started to roleplay on Discord at a fairly young age, like 12. Because I was so young I was very naive and easily manipulated. This one girl, who we will call \u2018 Jane \u2018 for this story was very nice to me when we first met. We were the same age, lived in the US, and liked the same things. We grew very close and roleplayed together daily. \n\nJane and I still talk and she is the main issue of the story. She used to force me to do erotic roleplays and as a childish 12 year old who barely knew what sex was, well I felt so guilty and dirty. Jane didn\u2019t care when I expressed this to her and because of my shy and push over nature continued to let this happen. \n\nOur friendship continued, we grew closer as friends, sharing personal stories and selfies, we even video called a few times. We continued to roleplay even though I was uncomfortable and unhappy\n\nAs we roleplayed together I noticed that not only were her characters boring, basic, and just copies of one another but if they messed up and one of my characters got angry at them Jane would stop the whole roleplay to yell at me. She\u2019d would be angry because I called her character out on messing up. One time in particular, her male ( gay ) character literally RAPED my straight male character. When both me and my character showed how disgusted, horrified, and displeased we were with this behavior she got MAD at ME for being childish and a baby. I knocked some sense into my self and finally told her that I didn\u2019t want to rp with her anymore. \n\nJane and I remained friends but didn\u2019t rp for a few months, I agreed to continue when she promised to respect my boundaries. \n\nSo we started again. Yes, she didn\u2019t push my limits anymore but she INSISTED on doing ALL homosexual roleplays with me and they ALL had to be slightly erotic. I have NO issue with the LGBTQ+ community but I\u2019m not comfortable ONLY doing homosexual male characters. I like some variety. But I agreed and continued like an idiot.\n\nAs I previously stated Jane\u2019s characters are \n- bland \n- boring\n- copies of one another \n- overly sexual \n- unable to face consequences \n- always in the right \n- or Mary/Gary sues \n\nIt\u2019s so *annoying* when I pour my heart out trying to make fun, interesting, and diverse characters and she tells me I can\u2019t use them. \n\nFor example, I had made an very artsy Latino boy and she proceeded to tell me I couldn\u2019t use him because her characters wouldn\u2019t like to date a Mexican boy. This ENRAGED me. Not only is is racist but this character was seriously 100 times more interesting than all her characters put together. \n\nAnother time, I made a young male with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome after having to do a school project on an inherited disorder. I thought this disorder was very interesting and I wanted to express my interest in a new innovative character. When I showed her my character she said she didn\u2019t want to roleplay or have her characters date someone who was disabled. Yes, his diagnosis may hinder his ability to do certain things but he\u2019s not disabled. \n\nSimilarly, I made a well-put-together young man who was abused in childhood. For WEEKS I researched the affects of PTSD/ depression/anxiety on the human psyche. Unlike her boring and frankly offensively written depressed characters, mine was convincingly depressed. She once again told me that he was \u201c disabled \u201c and she didn\u2019t want me to use him. \n\nShe does a few other things such as idolizing Asian people and those in the LGBTQ+ community, thinking rape is even remotely okay, not respecting me or my wishes, and a lot more I can\u2019t think of off the bat.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I stupidly agree to her antics. I suppose I crave companionship because I don\u2019t have many friends in real life or online but I\u2019m honestly sick of her. For 3 years I have been her little slave and I\u2019m thinking for cutting her off as high-school, volleyball, and theater is getting in the way of my free time. I truly appreciate those who take the time to read this. Have a great night :)",

            "selftext": "\n\n\n\nTL:DR at the bottom, this one is really long\n\n\nHello redditors, I'm in a bit of a pickle here, I'm part of a small discord RP group of about 10 or so players, and while some of us are less active than others. we are all good friends, However, there is one person, let's call him host/ player X, who has shown to be very unfair with how he hosts his RPs and plays on our fairly large shared verse freeform RP,\u00a0\n\n\nThis all started in November 2018 when I was playing his D&amp;D style RP that he had decided to\u00a0 timeskip to the end, and we were fighting the final boss. Things seemed to be going poorly, so I had my character prepair what would of been a heroic Sacrafice hopefully do some significant damage for once, however, this resulted in one of his heroic characters calling mine a \"Fucking idiot\" and another of his supposedly ally characters attacking my character and tying them up and not allowing them to escape, none of the other players were subjected to this treatment, and hardly any of his characters had objections to this. Later on in the battle, my character was denied yet another chance to attack because the final boss was surrounded by water, even though there was no indication given my character couldn't swim earlier in the RP, and other NPCs were fine with swimming in this water and could keep acting\n\n\nWhen I made complaints about the binding via private message, he basically told me to shut up and that I had to follow the rules and that he could not be held accountable for his character's words and actions because they were the words and actions of his characters and that I was immature for being unable to distinguish between him and his Characters. He also wouldn't even let me try to tell him what gear and powers my character would potentially get during the timeskip because it would be favoritism ((to be fair, He did at least let me use an outside weapon my character would have have gotten if the game hadn't been time skipped, but still ignored this weapon's potential to cut her restraints or harm his NPC when that time came and the weapon was still inferior to a lot of spells and equipment the other players had, plus my Character also didn't get a chance to access an NPCs artifact cupboard that the other players were ae to use)) yet was perfectly fine giving another player a powerful illusion spell and another spell that, when combined with the previously mentioned illusion spell, would allow him to see other players' actions and tailor his illusions against the players to manipulate them and their actions, effectively allowing that one player to meta-game and screw over other players if he felt fit to do so. The most my character, a time witch, got, was a spell that randomly shuffled the perception of time of everyone but herself, not even a simple, reliable time manipulating spell.\u00a0 And furthermore, it backfired and was used to the benefit host X\u2019s NPCs despite the disadvantage they would, in theory, be given due to the distorted prescription of time they should also be experiencing. Thanks to these incidents and the previously mentioned timeskip robbing her of the chance to be developed properly in verse. I feel that my time witch, who was supposed to become a sneaky, well trained rouge hell bent on getting revenge on the heros that shut down the criminal agency she was a top member of, was reduced to being a complete idiot who couldn't even grasp the basics of her speciality and wasn't even capable of acting appropriately in combat despite it being implied she had the equivalent of special forces training in physical and magical combat. It should also be noted that none of the other players were attacked by the host's NPCs nor were denied the ability to attack because of an environmental effect. My character was also not given an opportunity to access an artifact cupboard owned by one of Host X's NPCs before the final battle while everyone else was given this opportunity.\n\n\n\nNow, this would have been fine and dandy, after all, it could've just been a string of unlucky rolls right? Wrong, after comforting host X with the help of another player, we learned that the final battle had been godmodded by host X, likely making it impossible for the players, as only the metagamer and host X's NPCS were able to do any significant damage to the final boss himself. Therefore, myself and the others have strong reasoning to believe that the dice rolls leading to my character\u2019s misfortune the host claimed his character won were nothing but lies as well. Fabricated to trick me into thinking it was a legitimate loss instead of being a fix.\n\n\nFor the past year or so, every time we have brought this up to host X, he has been dismissive\u00a0 and tried to downplay this issue as smaller than it is despite the god-modding and being very unfair to my character and has never properly apologized to myself out of verse ((he has said sorry to me a few times, but they don't feel genuine, especially bas there are more incidents to follow that have similar issues to this)), or to my character in verse, the most he did was change the effect of that spell to something more useful, but this didn't happen until a month or so after the RP ended so it is basically useless. Unfortunately. Host X's misdeeds have continued throughout the last year, both in his other RPs, and in our communal freeform RP and a lot of those incidents carry some similarities to this incendent, hence why it has always been brought up when future incidents occour. This particular incident has also been mentioned to just about every member of our community and virtually all of them stand against host X on this matter, all I've asked is that he apologizes properly to the character and myself and show he has changed his ways, but sadly, this is not the case as the RP is now closed, and host X thinks this event is largely irrelevant due to how long ago it was. In fact, during a recent conversation about something like this occurring again in a newer RP that was hosted in Host X's server, one of the host's ally NPCs there was only revealed after my character showed what she could do, and this NPC has an ability that seemed pretty much tailor made to counter my character\u2019s abilities at a moment's notice, instead of addressing the issue when I brought up the issue from the previous RP and it's similarities to this, Host X deleted the post from his server referencing the friendly fire incident opposed to actually addressing my concerns of it happening again in this RP. It took an organized call our from several players in order to get him to acknowlge the problem with this and even then he seemed evasive from what I recall,\u00a0\n\n\nAround the same time in this RP, still on host X's own server, in August 2019, two players were loosely railroaded into a fight against two enemy twins who used fire and ice powers, alongside some ally NPCs, I was not one of those players, but from what I saw, Every attack the players made was met with the attack being blocked or otherwise stopped. One of the players even tried to be creative by ricocheting their projectiles off the walls but this attack was also stopped, on the very next turn, that Player became trapped in an avalanche from one of the twin's powers, almost mirroring what happened to my Previous character in the incident above ((which is partially why Host X has not been forgiven for it, despite it being over a year ago)), both players eventually complained on the general chat and were only told that the fight was not impossible and to take what they knew about powers and use it to their advantage, despite not being given any clear in game hints on what to do to counter those powers, eventually, one of Host X's NPCs revealed that the twins couldn't use their powers together or hit each other with their powers, however, none of this was conveyed during the battle itself as the twins were comfortable using their powers in close proximity and showed no signs of concern about the other one's abilities, in fact, at one point, the ice twin was able to surround both twins in a dome of snow, and as soon as a player broke though part of the dome, they were countered by a flame pillar from the other twin, which in my eyes, would imply that the twins were perfectly fine with each other's powers. While the players were victorious, they were once again denied any chance to do any real damage until host X's NPCs straight up told them what to do,\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this kind of behaviour isn't limited to host X's own RPs, in our communal freeform RP, Host X has carried out some similar shenanigans, in one instance, he completely ignored any and all detection abilities everyone else's characters may have had so he could slip his own antagonist into an area and steal the souls from 3 big bosses that the other players had been fighting to power his own villian up further, luckily, this boss was able to control souls beyond the grave and ended up being reborn as a new entity on the side of good with this villian's powers as her own, what myself and other players deemed a suitable punishment for Player X's actions, unfortunately, there have been multiple occasions where player X inflates his villains to be untouchable by other player's characters, the most egregious example of this is in the newest Version of the RP,\u00a0\n\n\nThis version of the RP has some semi strict rules involving characters, all characters that fight, and outlines of their powers and abilities must be added to a communal character list that everyone can access, and characters must not be artificially powered up for the sake of winning a confrontation. During a battle in a magic based town, player X's character was unlisted in the communal character list and player X has admitted to having a private character list that he will not share with us which has some other players concerned he is up to something, in this more recent case, Player X's character was being pinned down by gravity magic and a life draining ability, however, Player X then made their character transform into a new form with almost no warning and still no information on the charcter list, this new form happened to be immune to the gravity magic and was able to walk off the life drain as if nothing happened and went on to threaten to blow up the town, an action that would of brought several unconnected plots to an end and would of killed off a lot of characters, I will admit I may have overreacted by bringing in an overpowered character of my own to stop this from happening, but me and the other players involved agreed it had to be done, or an admin character would have had to fix it anyway.\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem like this kind of thing will end any time soon, that character was a minion of player X's ultimate Villain, who is attempting to capture many of player X's other characters in order to fuel his artifact that will let him take control of reality. This villian himself and the powers he possesses are also not on the communal character list by the way. Given player X's past actions as a player and host, myself and the other players are concerned that Player X will continue to use his dishonourable tactics to downplay our characters and amp up his Villains to ensure the artifact's completion, and then wreck havoc on our realms despite the power rules we have in place, only to have this once again solved by one of his heros with a Deus ex machina. Assuming the admins don't stop him, as a matter of fact, Player X has already been disregarding and downplaying some of our characters\u2019s abilities by having inconsistent rules for our characters compared to his own. In player X's eyes, it is ok for his villains to be able to beat any character and then inflict serious damage to their soul to steal their powers and prevent them using magic, but it is not ok for our characters that are on the communal character list and that specialize in high tier soul manipulation to be able to repair the damaged souls of his characters unless they know his characters really well. Effectively preventing the characters who have lost to his villain regaining their powers, making them easy pickings should they need to be recaptured.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile this hasn't happened yet, myself and the other main players in this RP are concerned that, given player X's history as a host and player, Player X's villain is guaranteed to complete his artifact and will gain the power to control reality, an ability that the players have seemingly collectively agreed is banned in this version of the RP, the only character who has that level of power is a hero character who has been there since the first incarnation of this RP before the rule was in place and they have been massively toned down to accommodate the new rules and regulations that are now in place. However it has become apparent that, much to our dismay, thay character may need to be restored to her former glory to counteract this villian when they power up for the sake of every player's realms.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMost recently ((February 2020)), two of player X's villians's subordinates were captured by another player's hero and handed over to player X's law enforcement organisation for incarceration, however, Player X recently had his Villain attack the organisation entirely off screen, giving none of the players and chance to react against it if they had Characters able to and allowing his villian to take back the two subordinates completely unhindered, effectively undoing the in Character work done to capture them. While admittidly, handing them over to player X's organization was a mistake, it still doesn't change the fact that player X's villain was able to undo the hero's work in an instant off screen with no chance for counterplay ((he literally just posted the results of the attack, nothing about the attack being about to happen or any events of the attack taking place)). One of the Characters rescued was even imprisoned with no opportunity to fight back. just like my Character way back in 2018. this was largely deemed acceptable as it was an interaction between two of Player X's groups of Characters, after bringing it up with the server admin, he stated that regardless of whether they were between a player's own Characters or or multiple player's Characters, off screen actions would not be allowed to significantly affect a plot, it is currently unclear if this action will be retconned.\n\n\nMyself and the other players have called player/host X out on his bad behaviour numorous times over the past year or so, and though he promises to change, things always seem to just get worse a few months later as he downplays or ignores the significance of the events that have transpired and looks for ways to deflect out criticisms opposed to learning from them, in the meantime, the owner of the communal RP server is aware of our complaints in regards to player X, and has helped set up some rules to limit the damage they can do and agreed to take action if Player X's reality controlling Characters gets out of hand.\n\n\nAm I the A hole for ensuring that Host/player X's actions are not forgotten by the community and putting them through this? And what would you guys reccomend we do going forward?\u00a0\n\n\nTL:DR: Host/Player X shows a ridiculous amount of NPC favoratsim in his own RPs to the point where he mistreats players, and godmods his RPs to keep his NPCs on top, to the point of outright abusing and mistreating other player's characters to ensure the story goes in one specific way and refuses to apologize properly for doing so and change his ways after doing so, opting to deflect criticism or hide from it instead, leading me to myself and other members of our community unable to fully forgive him for what he has done.\u00a0 as a player in a communal RP, he ignores the attributes and abilities of other people's Characters, doesn't use the communal list the server rules say he should use, instead opting to use a private list of characters that he will not make available not everyone, despite being told to do so, and the players of the server beleave he will continue to use his dishonourable tactics of downplaying and powerplaying to ensure his villain is able to carry out his plan and reach a level of power that has effectively been banned and then abuse that power, when called out for his actions by a group of players, he deflects incidents far in the past saying they are irrelevant, even though underlying issues from those incidents apply to his more recent offences as well and are still somewhat valid and claims he's going to change, only to go near silent for a few months and then re-offend.\n\nLooking for advice in advance in case he re-offends,",

            "selftext": "Once years ago I knew someone who connected so well with me, so creatively we were just so on the same wavelength. We wrote together every single day for a full year, we had created this huge world and we had so many character that filled it. It was beautiful and amazing, but then we drifted apart as people and I lost that world... but I want to make something like that again with another person. \n\nEver since then I\u2019ve been trying and trying so hard to find that other person I can connect with like that, but it\u2019s... so so hard. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just not finding the right people, or if my expectations are high now that I did have it once so good with someone? I feel like I\u2019m not super picky, but still I\u2019m struggling. \n\nMy issue so far is that a lot of people are super submissive and don\u2019t really take charge in the story? They don\u2019t plot and just expect me to write all the twists and turns, and it\u2019s mentally draining. I really want a rp partner that\u2019s similar to me where we are constantly surprising one another as we have our characters go on an adventure together. Equals. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be harsh but I also noticed that like majority of people want to play just submissive roles and do a strict specific thing (example; high school, one setting stories), but my brain is so creative and explosive that I just like making the rules and the world as I go. I have so many good ideas and I don\u2019t want my brain to be locked up in a (metaphorical) high school setting. \n\nI\u2019m just ranting and venting. I\u2019m stressed out because this is a huge deal with me. Rp is super important for me, even when I\u2019m super busy irl I still always make time to be active. I feel like giving up searching, but I know I\u2019ll find someone eventually, but as I sit here typing this message I feel so pessimistic. So so pessimistic about it all.",

I did not feel comfortable roleplaying with her any longer.\n\n\\-I did not start roleplaying with someone because they insisted  that there are alpha and beta males, all 'females' have the instinct to breed with the alpha males, and so on. I just felt uncomfortable roleplaying with the person after reading this.\n\n\\-Ended a roleplay about nordic mythology because the person I roleplayed with kept talking about his extremist right wing world views, how German people are better than everyone else, sharing very explicit music etc. I am not talking about moderate right wing stuff. I mean stuff which was straight up neo-nazi views (I am from Germany).\n\nWould you consider my behavior over the top, because it is just their personal life and it did not have a (direct) influence on the rp? Or did you do something similiar once? I am open for discussion.",
