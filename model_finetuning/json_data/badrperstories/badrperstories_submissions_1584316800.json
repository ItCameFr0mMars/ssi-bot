Now I\u2019m a flaming liberal; a card holding member of the Green Party, a vegetarian pacifist, and a women\u2019s activist.  I\u2019m THAT kind of liberal.  But I want to rp.  So I messaged him and he happily agreed to try an rp.  \n\nNearly a week later we\u2019ve been having the time of our lives romping around the Galaxy.  \n\nMay the Force be with you and may you all find such excellent rp partners in such unexpected places.",

            "selftext": "So I'm a mod of a discord rp server, there's about 5-6 of us who are pretty active and have become pretty good friends from chatting a lot in the general chat. So everyone's getting along well and everyone's participating in the rp except the owner seems to maybe have ghosted the server? They were somewhat active at the start, but despite them often being online, they aren't replying which makes it difficult for us to move on with the rp especially since they are the main character (its a fandom rp). I understand that maybe something could be happening irl with them causing them to not reply as I have been on that side of the equation before, but the rest of us really want to move on with the story and it's been about 3 weeks since we've heard from them at all, but they have been online. I was wondering if maybe we should try to reach out to them? Any advice would be great, thank you!",

I eventually got in a screaming match with him over something else- I think it was him trying to say Dragons are mammals... Because I made a dragon and human hybrid race and got it accepted. (Which by the way I had it set up- was bullshit since they're cold-blooded and have scales on that server.)\n\nSecond- A power-player who- a friend of mine for a year up until a few months ago made a freaking unbeatable villain character, and made the 'strongest' character in the RP... -\\_- The only way to kill this villain was to find seven hearts- to which he never eluded to in the RP or out of character. Looking back, I shouldn't have accepted it since I was the co-owner of the server. This dude tried to enter a character that would have 150% of every category, such as magic, physical strength, perception, speed, etc. That one was thankfully not accepted because that was also some rank bullshit. Later- the same dude wouldn't stop saying the words for... the fertilizer for babies... On a server with kids on it- and I was uncomfortable, after asking him several times to stop, I finally just cut off my friendship with him after a year.\n\nThird- A dude who said his character is inevitable and could defeat gods... In a server that didn't allow gods. The same guy went on about how another character of his could control probability...Which is very much god-modding/Powerplaying. I continue to shake my head at this dude since I'm still in the same server as he is.",

            "selftext": "So I found this subreddit today and after a few years of both discord and Minecraft RP, I have quite a few stories to tell. This is the one I first thought of.\n\nMe = Horus\n\nAnnoying character = king\n\nLess annoying character = agent\n\nVictim character = V\n\nSo I was in this roleplay. About 10 players. I started out playing a character they already knew from other RPs, but they randomly decided to switch from Fantasy to Cyberpunk or Sci Fi or something like that.\n\nI change my character to Horus, an AI created by UN researchers in cooperation with a race of dragon people. His schtick was that he gained sentience by assimilating parts of other programs such as AIs and Viruses. \n\nSo eventually the owner of the house the RP takes place in agrees to grant Horus permission to connect to the House's network. I start RPing a bit and really focus on the whole \"UN AI\" bit, in other words being Lawful Neutral stick-up-his-rear in regard to the international laws. \n\nAt some point, King breaks up with V. And proceeds to shoot her. In the house. She survives somehow but it's still a shooting\n\nHorus tells him that hey this isn't cool. He should stand trial. King refuses because he's a king so he can't be charged with crimes.\n\nThis goes on for a while until Horus calls the police on King. He RPs as the police, who enter the house, ignore King and tries to demand Horus shuts down. Horus gives them a \"permission denied\" until eventually the police leaves. \n\nAt this point I've dropped that Horus operates by spreading his code between computers that were constantly in connection (I know, might be borderline godmod to prevent char death but it seemed logical for an AI to do). While King has said he's the king of the major of five nations who are fighting a larger nation. Before you ask: no, he isn't staff or anything. We were equals in that server.\n\nKing keeps trying to hack Horus, who keeps giving him access denied. When I expressed confusion as to why a king would know how to hack, Agent, King's secret agent or whatever tried. Still giving access denied because I wasn't about to have my character reprogrammed into a supporter of his super awesome white knight character.\n\nOut of character, at this point I had supplied a map for the owner. With the country we were roleplaying in being the largest, followed by King's BBEG empire and his own 5 kingdoms, followed by my city of dragon people on a small, barren peninsula. He got upset because his kingdoms were larger. Do note, this wasn't official server lore, or accepted lore, it was his own idea. I ignored this and continued to roleplay.\n\nDiscovering that the bulk of Horus was hosted in the Dragon city, King went there, demanding access to the servers. The guards flat out refused access. To try and threaten them into cooperation, fighter jets flew into town.\n\nNow, I know this part is bad on my behalf but stick with me. In previous roleplays, it was established that this city was an Outpost belonging to a big nation of dragon people who replaced technology with magic. And spent most of their existence at war (peace having been made somewhere in the 1900s). So when fighter jets fly over trying to subjugate the population, bad things happen.\n\nA few moments of magical anti air later, the jet was scrapped.\n\nEventually King gave up, heading back to the main RP location. Agent had tried a few more times to mess up Horus but failed.\n\nSome more RP goes by. V recovers, King claims that he was declared not guilty on grounds of insanity claim because \"he was heaviy affected by his emotions and not thinking straight\". If Horus could facepalm he'd done it.\n\nEventually a truck stops outside belonging to King. It contains EMPs. He detonates the EMPs on the house, frying electronics (but miraculously not Agent's cybernetics) until they're restored by the owner's character. Horus, in the meanwhile, returns after everything is fixed, almost unaffected. \n\nMore time goes by, some forgettable RP happens, another truck appears and King goes to unload a barrel from it. Containing nanites. Powered by an AI that was, I kid you not\n\"Horus but better\"\n\nAt this time, the RP server all but died. Too bad. I loved my AI rules lawyer.\n\nI do have a question. Was I acting overly obnoxious? I personally thought that he should be somewhat affected by attempted murder in the middle of a community other than some angsty self-loathing, but if you have other opinions please do share",

If someone stops replying for a substantial amount of time, I understand that they are no longer interested in continuing our roleplay. And I move on. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand, however, are the partners that make excuses for themselves and then don\u2019t follow through with their promises to return. For example, I had a partner who hadn\u2019t responded to me in a month. I didn\u2019t pursue them, didn\u2019t bug them for a reply. I figured that it was over.\n\nOne day, they just popped up in my PMs and explained that they were having IRL issues, and that they will have a reply for me by tomorrow. I reassured them that it was no big deal. I even told them that if they didn\u2019t want to continue, it was no problem. They apologized profusely and once again told me that they would be getting a reply to me tomorrow, for sure. Weeks went by without a word. And then, they unfriended me. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand that logic.",

So I write something like:\nMe: \u201cMary held her hand out to shake \u2018it\u2019s nice to meet you\u2019 she stated with a smile\u201d. \nThem: \u201cI reach out to shake YOUR hand\u201d\nThrough an entire paragraph they referred to this very clear side character as my character MULTIPLE TIMES. No problem, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Maybe I just need to be clearer. I make it clear again, using the side characters name when playing them and then saying things like me and I with my own character right after to give the hint. They seem to catch on. Well then they mess up happens in similar ways over and over again.\n\nI mentioned it\u2019s an apartment building and they would be living with another person but they refer to the room as a single bedroom for just them. Ok no big deal, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear enough again, I clear it up by describing the space, describing the two bedrooms in it, and mentioning it\u2019s an apartment building again.\nThen I give them the code that was mentioned earlier in the role play that lets you into the apartment. Right after I tell them they say something like \u201cI don\u2019t have a key yet, don\u2019t wanna get locked out\u201d. RIGHT AFTER I TOLD THEM THE CODE.\n\nI\u2019m still working with them because I feel like maybe there\u2019s a chance I\u2019m still not clear enough? Part of me wonders if there is some sort of language barrier since their writing is fine but sometimes how you understand things can be wrong. Who knows.\n\nP.S.\nAlso saw something again recently that has me facepalm every time. If I give you my character description and then give you essentially all the freedom to make yours, don\u2019t steal my specific character details. \nExample: My character was said to have killed their teammate and the person includes the same detail. (This is not something that is normal/seen as ok for that role plays context).\nBe creative. Sorry if I have what you wanted but there are other options. At the least ask before you do it.",

            "selftext": "I had a feeling I'd be posting here soon.\n\nSo, I see an ad up for what someone likes to rp. Seems nice, reasonable. They don't mind reply length, nice. I usually take that as a 'I write a fuck ton so don't feel the need to try and match it cause it's very long' in a non-condescending way of course.\n\nSo I answer the ad, we talk a bit about what all will happen. They still seemed nice and mature enough.\n\nWe decided on a thing where their character is a fairy that lives in my human characters gothic birdhouse and my character brings it in to un-goth it.\n\nI write the starter as they request. It was at least 7 paragraphs long. They reply with two. I'm a bit confused because of my original assumption but okay.\n\nIt became clear to me that they were the type that did no world-building of their own which was why their posts were so short. Okay, lets just keep going until I get annoyed.\n\nSo their fairy character is not scared of my human character in the slightest despite being in a human house and they don't explain why exactly the fairy is not scared. Think about Tinkerbell 3 (pretty sure thats the one where Tinkerbell is caught).\n\nTheir gothic fairy also doesnt seem to have any problem whatsoever that my character is making their house pastel colors. Doesn't even glance at it.\n\nSo my character asks the fairy questions and the fairy answers them. The fairy doesnt ask any questions at all. At this point I realized that If we were to continue, I would be carrying the whole rp on my back like I already had been so I blocked them.",
