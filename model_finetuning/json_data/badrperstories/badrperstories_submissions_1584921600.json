We both get excited about the same things and generate ideas at a similar rate. There have been some issues with it feeling like she dominates the scenes her MC is in, but we were able to get past this hurdle and it's been smooth sailing ever since.\n\nWe have many AUs planned for the series we're currently RPing post-canon. In all of them, the pairing where her MC bottoms do not have children because her MC would be too \"jealous\" of potentially losing some of their partner's attention.\n\nIn one of the AUs we have planned, we'd discussed the possibility of giving the partner an adult child from a previous marriage, because we'd agreed that he would want to be a father. My partner was very excited for this particular development and frequently talked about how sweet it would be that this character would get to be a protective dad. Then tonight we were talking about our plans for this AU when I mentioned the daughter in some context and my partner said, \"She's lucky that [MC] will let her live.\"\n\nI was confused and asked her to clarify, and got a speech about how the MC will hate the daughter and barely acknowledge her existence, but at least he won't have her killed or make his partner choose between them. WHAT????\n\nI said it sounded like MC would barely tolerate the daughter, and my partner added, \"She'll be proof of [partner's] past. A past that didn't include him.\"\n\nIt had already been established that the MC would go out of his way to cook, clean, and entertain for his husband's parents and siblings as a way to impress them and endear them to himself. FWIW in canon this character is a murderous sociopath, so I'm not sure how this is considered IC but not him not killing the daughter?\n\nI said that it would probably be better to just forget about the daughter as the kind of reaction she was proposing would cause significant and lasting strain on the relationship between the two characters. She got upset, blew me off for the rest of the night, and then let me know when she went to bed.\n\nWTF. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills for being so confused by this still. Not gonna lie, also feeling a little pissed off that this is somehow my fault for nixing the daughter character when her involvement would've done nothing. but introduce unnecessary problems.",

I know they're there and cam see the message.\n\nThing is when we first started talking we hit it off really well and I could easily see us being the best of friends if it had continued. And we were both REALLY excited about the RP we were going to do. Like we were essentially fangirling over it we were that excited. At first I gave them the benefit of the doubt and was like, \"okay they're probably just real sick they've been complaining about how they feel I'll give them a few days to recuperate no big deal.\" Well days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months. And now in a couple of months it'll have been nearly a year since we last actually spoke.\u00a0 I get it some people are sickly. They never feel healthy and are in and out of the doctors more then most. Especially these days with a pandemic going on.\n\nThen a few days ago an earthquake happened in the area where they lived and I saw them online so I thought I'd see if they were okay because I'm genuinely worried. After all they seem nice enough despite everything else.\n\n\nNothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm not sure what to do. I've been waiting so long for very little to nothing happening. I don't know what's going on or if it's even my fault and if it is what I did to warrant this or if they're just sick of me and want me to leave them alone or what.\n\nIf they're still sick I would have appreciated a \"hey I'm doing alright thanks for worrying about me this is what's going on blah blah blah\" at least every once in a while so I know it's not me. Like I said I'm so confused because we seemed to be getting along so fucking fantastically that it was like it was ment to be and then it didn't.\n\nShould I delete them off my discord?

It wasn't too long after that I started to get suspicious about my partner, while she brought energy and enthusiasm, it always seemed to be in response, never unprompted and usually, I hate that. Whenever I ask somebody's thoughts on a topic, I make sure to give my own opinions and general thoughts, but I foolishly took too long to call my partner out on this and that was mostly because I got caught in the trap of a surprising amount of enthusiasm I rarely got from someone who was mostly limited when they brought their own input. My partner provided great references, images and music that fit, clips from shows that did a great job of illustrating the details she had in mind...\n\nIt made me lose sight of the other flaws. I'm not saying this was the worst partner I've had, but she was the one I can confidently say I wasted the most time with. I guess what I'm trying to get out today is that even if someone you partner up with is brilliant, constructive or otherwise incredibly helpful in multiple ways doesn't mean you should ignore potential red flags or continue to give them the benefit of the doubt. Communicate and work with them, sometimes a problem can't or won't get fixed, but don't simply ignore them. Roleplaying should always be a two way street and if someone just wants to stubbornly restrict themselves to a one way roundabout.. \n\nDon't be afraid to move on.",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna try my best to explain this.\n\nSo I had an rp that revolved around my character being extremely clingy to the other persons character. Whenever I play this idea it usually works out alright even if the others character eventually gets fed up and snaps at mine because eventually they make up and get a healthier relationship because of it.\n\nThis person didnt go that route.\n\nSo we start the rp by my character asking theirs through 11 text messages if they wanted to hang out that day. This is the first response in the entire rp and their character says no. That they would rather have an alone day.\n\nMy character (A) is kind of confused and asks a lot if theyre okay, if they needed anything, what was wrong.  Their character (B) gets a little frustrated but doesnt show it too much over text, just explaining that they wanted an aline day.\n\nOkay, so thats kinda hard to work with for me. They seem like they fully intend to rp the whole day B is alone but still expect replies from me.\n\nA understands and everything, but does send them a meme that afternoon. I dont know what I expected this person to do but B just ignored the message. Again, difficult because A is actively trying to give them space and is not going to just randomly show up to B's house.\n\nSo I had A be close to a mental breakdown from being away and alone for so long. So he texts B about how he really needed someone. Keep in mind that in rp time it was 5:30pm so I thought maybe that would be enough time for B.\n\nB accuses A of being manipulative, making B seem like the bad guy, and B is tired of being A's parent all the time.\nA keeps on trying to just apologise but doesnt really see how asking for their help as a friend was manipulative at all.\n\nB continues in accusing A of being manipulative and toxic. Nothing about the writing seemed to imply the possibility of B overreacting. It seemed to think that B was the good person in this situuation.\n\nSo lacking the emotional support and having someone they practically worship be angry at him, A has that mental breakdown and they dont speak for what Im assuming is a week because I just took it upon myself to timeskip to a time that they were both present.\n\nB wants A to apologise (even though they did like 8 times) and prove that A even cares if B is okay at all (which he already did by asking those follow up questions of why they would have an alone day)\n\nA is just being super honest about how they felt that they put a lot more effort into their friendship than B did, because A never asks for anything and the one time that they did need something, B exploded on them.\n\nB keeps on trying to storm off dramatically after they keep repeating the whole manipulative bad guy blah blah blah.\n\nSo eventually A is open about why they needed B so bad at that time. It was because A was feeling suicidal at the time and just needed a friend to distract him.\n\nB doesn't believe A (for literally no reason whatsoever) and the writing is still making A to be the bad guy here even though its more of a grey situation.\n\nThe rp ended with B monologing that A needed to 'learn a lesson' and B purposefully disappears off the map, rumors going around that B was dead.\n\nDude, no. How in the fuck is that not manipulative and abusive on B's part to purposefully make A think that B is dead? They thought that B was in the right this entire rp. So I ended it with an IC reply of A not believing that B was really dead, and suspecting that B was only doing it to bother him. So he wasnt going to be concerned, let alone be  B's friend anymore if they legitimately couldnt see A's point of view even though A had tried to talk things out multiple times.\nThe end.\n\nJesus Christ. I shouldve talked to the other person, but I didnt know what to say. I didn't want to get into a real argument with anyone. There were a lot of times before then that I thought about just leaving the rp but something was telling me not to.",

I don't want pity or anything, but advice to just avoid this in the future.  \n\n\nThis basically started because there was an rp drought with me and my friend. We barely had any new ideas we wanted to rp, nor did we have much motivation to continue or begin a new one. Whatever conversations we'd have were quite short, with my friend sometimes ignoring responses, though this was rare. At times, we'd have alright conversations, but they felt distant sometimes. After a while, I couldn't take how weird it felt and I decided to \"address\" the issue by tiptoeing around it and now it's 100x more dramatic, emotional, and selfish than I wanted it to be. I kept mentioning things about quitting roleplaying all together, but that's what my emotions were telling me what to do for some reason. I even went as far as refusing to speak because I couldn't handle going a few minutes without a response. Before I could type anything else, I actually took time to read my garbage replies and realized how bad they were and well... I couldn't get myself out of this because I'm already knee deep in my awful pity party to turn any of this around without making the situation worse.
