Most of the time it becomes weird. I ask for a fluffy cute romance. Boy meets girl we live happily ever after scenario.\nIt becomes a whole porn sordid affair. It's demoralizing to be honest. Maybe it's my fault because i grew up reading romance novels.\nTheir characters tend to be rough, selfish and \"controlling\" they call my character insulting names that just makes me want to quit writing with them.\n\nAnother thing very few know how to do historical roleplays. They overpower their kings, have zero ideas about politics, manners or consequences. Like no honey your character cannot kill rando x character without consequence. I mean he could but this would be an entirely different roleplay. If you want to play a mad king we can but that means we get to overthrow you.\n\nPS. Keep the same pov in every post. Show some vulnerability to your character. Give him a personality that's more than rough angry dude with a smirk. Stop making him all shouty for no reason. It doesn't make him look powerful but whiny. \n\nThis is why I like roleplaying with girls more. I learned to play male characters because you guys can't. I rather give a girl her three hours of fluff than your five minutes of rough smut.\n\nAs I said not all men. I had the delight of meeting a few who were just wonderful and understanding and respectful. To those I tip my wine filled glass.\nYou know who you are.\nTo those I have ghosted now you know why.",

You could definitely see them being in the military without stretching the imagination at all.\n\nBut the fucking bad ones man. The Bad ones are fantastic when you run a group roleplay. I remember I was running a New World Order modern science fiction roleplay. Large empire, coupled with unreasonably large rebellion force, that kinda cringe. \n\nI remember me and the other people running the game decided PC's couldn't be any higher than a Commodore, O6 by Canadian Standards. Cringe in it's own respects, but we managed. y character was the Commodore and I would basically walk around saying nice things to people and complimenting them and sending them on missions. I was supposed to be the nice commander who wasn't really in a rush, but was actually in a rush.\n\nANYWAY! So, new guy comes along, submits his character sheet. I go to read it over and see if there are any problems. Character's 19 years old. Looks good. Then it all went down hill. \n\nThey were a top ranking sniper in the USMC ((Which didn't exist in setting)), They were a 4 star General of the Army, their pet was a Half White Wolf, Half Albino Bengal Tiger, and Half Polar Bear. Cherry on the cake? They had the exact same last name as my character, and was a child soldier. My character was 46 years old. \n\nTurns out, this guy was under the impression that his character could be all that plus my characters blipping child. I didn't know this person from Adam. I didn't know him from Eve, or their overly friendly neighbor Steve. He didn't seem to get it. He was like \"You just don't wanna be shown up by your son!\" And I couldn't help but laugh, cause it was absurd.   \n\n\nAny of you ever have an absurd player come up with some retarded combination?",

I think it adds some flavour to the story and can be used for interesting plot hooks (once a character took it upon themselves to restore my characters eyesight, which was a very cute and interesting plot).\nOf course, not everyone shares this opinion and that's okay - I will play a \"normal\" character if my partner tells me that they don't particularly like disadvantaged characters.\n\n\nBefore we started, I asked my partner if it would be okay for him that my character would be blind. He said okay, no problem.\n\nBut apparently it was a problem or he was just lazy, because after a while he told me \"Oh, since your character's blind, I don't have to describe my character's mimics and stuff.\" \n\nAnd he actually stopped doing that. From that point on, he only wrote what his character said. No emotions, no mimic, no hand or body movement.\n\nI was very puzzled, because my character did react on those descriptions. Like when he was telling a story and tears welled up in his eyes. She didn't see those tears, of course, but she could tell by the way a voice changed when you have to fight down tears. Things like that.\n\nI tried to react adequately on his now one sentence paragraphs, but well... I (and therefore my character) ended up not understanding when his character was being sarcastic or tired to be funny.\n\nSo after a very short while I asked him to start describing his characters actions again. Which he did... on a bare minimum. Like he would only describe something if it was directly involving my character (i. e. touching her). I got so annoyed that I ended this play shortly after.",

I felt like, for once, I belonged somewhere.\n\nPt 1: the intro. \n\nI created a tomb raider account, and that's how I met Roddy. He sent me a request with his OC and I accepted because his profile info seemed pretty cool. The OC was creative, original, and adventurous... I remember thinking \"Oh my gosh he and Lara would have some amazing adventures together!\"\n\nObviously, he wasn't thinking the same thing.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, he was a talented writer. At first, the story we wrote was normal...he planted the idea that they were wold lovers, she left him etc. I decided \"Eh, whatever,\" as long as romance didn't take over the storyline. They were supposed to work together to find an artifact, but it turned into them hiding in a crammed part of the cave, his OC breathing on her neck, complimenting the vanilla scent on her skin...\n\nAnd then, like that, he vanishes. For a month. It was his turn to write, and I would see him on the account, but he wouldn't reply. Well, there was a friend of mine who played a character and was going through a depressing time irl, so I figured \"It's been a month since this Roddy guy has written me back, I guess the story wasn't for him.\" NOTE: the characters were not even shipped. So, my friend and I got to writing another story, and holy shit did the two characters click. It was like they were made for eachother. My friend introduced me to his writer friends, we all clicked, it was amazing.\n\nAnother month passes, and Roddy returns. Sees my Lara is in a relationship with someone and tells me I have to pick between roddys character and the other one.\n\nI told him since he didn't reply for a month, yet would show online... Rather than send messages, I took it as a hint that he didn't want to continue. He removed me from his contacts.\n\nI should have just moved on, but the empathetic part of me felt bad, so what do I do? I create a new character just for Roddy. Surprise him with it, but he's clever and figures it out before I could tell him. I only wanted to make him happy. That's why I did that.\n\nPart 2: Hangouts.\n\nMore months go by, and Roddy and I soon exchange contact into on Google Hangouts. This is when I start tainting my talent of writing and start... Smut. Which I was very, very new at.\n\nSoon the writing became....personal. Intimate. He would tell me things he wanted to do to me in real life. We opened up to one another. Got very intimate and close. I was too blind and naieve to realize he was controlling... Telling me to do things for him and only him. Telling me rather intimate things I'm still ashamed of. We would talk every single night. Made multiple smut stories, not thinking that this was LITERALLY the only thing he ever wanted to write with me. Not even realizing thta every adventure story I came up with, he created a smut scene and then stop writing that scene.\n\nHe'd beg me to create more girl characters for him. Insist on certain face claims, telling me this bikini model or that playboy bunny would make him so happy if that was my characters face claim. So, I obey. I use an underwear model be picked for an XMen character. I used a playboy photo for my OCs. Face claims I picked were never good enough, and if I didn't choose his FC, he wouldn't write with me.\n. Being stupid and blinded by my emotions, I changed for him.\n\nOh I should mention this bit: he friended another account I had, and flirted HARD. CORE. on days he would not reply to my OC account. Stating he had to go and was going to work...but then would send my other account messages during that time. Needless to say I confronted him. He had nothing to say. \n\nPart 3- the girl.\n\nWe have a discord group. I bring a friend to the group and introduce her to everyone, including Roddy. He takes a huge interest.\n\nLittle did I realize what would happen. You see, two months after they meet, she tells me he wants to be her boyfriend.\n\nFun fact: THE DAY BEFORE SHE SAYS THIS, he said he loved me. He talked intimate and sexy to me. But HE SAID HE LOVED ME. failed to mention to me that he had feelings for someone else.\n\nI confront him about it. What does he do? He brings up the Lara croft account. As if everything happened because of me choosing my friend over Roddy. He gaslights.\n\nI cry about it to another friend, when LOW AND BEHOLD... he was doing the SAME DAMN THING to another girl! That's THREE GIRLS he was leading on! THREE!!! (third girl we Call Raven) \n\nNaturally, the girls teamed up. Compared notes. Realized he was saying the same thing to all of us.\n\nHis 'girlfriend' confronts him, but in the end he comes to me to scold me. How dare we talk? How DARE we realize he was saying the same thing to everyone?! How dare we compare notes?\n\nBut, I was blind and stupid. I apologized. Cried. I was soon told it was okay as long as I swore to never talk about him behind his back, and if anyone did to immediately tell him.\n\nI never told him. We all still talked.\n\nPart 4- leaving him.\n\nA year passes by. A whole year. And in that year, he befriended more female friends, wrote smut with all of them, even flirted with someone under 19 years of age. While he was definitely in his 30s.\n\nHe wouldn't write with my characters as much. They were collecting dust, and my muses were slowly dying.\n\nI find out from his NOW \"ex\" that she hacked into his accounts, and saw thta for all eight of his accounts, he was writing smut with HUNDREDS of women. Including ones we were individually shipped with (which was a huge deal because he would go on a speech about how single ship writing was the way to go.) So, I cut loose. I messaged him stating I was removing one of the characters he was writing with. Gave it two days, and then deleted it.\n\nHE. WAS. PISSED.\n\nberated me. Scolded me. Stated I had no right removing my own character. We hadn't written anything in FIVE. MONTHS. I couldn't keep waiting, not when others wanted to write. I didn't want to get guilt tripped for writing with other male characters.\n\nHe is a controlling narcissist. I didn't see it then. But what he did and how he talked to me hurt more than anything.\n\nI removed him. I cut all ties.\n\nPart 5 - truce?\n\nI felt bad how things ended. Idk why, stupid empath part of me wanted to send a \"I wish you all the best and goodbye\" message.\n\nHe asked to talk. We did. What did it consist of? Oh, the usual. He would scold me, tell him how I affected him with what I said and did. But when I would talk to g about his mistakes, he doesn't wanna hear it and just wants to suddenly move on.\n\nHere I'm thinking, fine\nWhatever.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI noticed how he never changed. Even though he was dating another user, he still called me babe, beautiful, saying all this flirty shit.\n\nWanting me to make OCs for him and only him.\n\nI left him again, getting the closure I needed.\n\nNot to mention an OC account was made and he message me because he thought she was beautiful, and instantly tried starting with a smut scene.\n\nThat was my big closure.\n\nHe was never going to change. Ever. \n\nHe still hasn't changed. \n\nPart 6 The Mole. \nSo after weeks of crying, I finally get over how everything happened. I start taking a step back and noticing his toxic behavior and how poorly he treated me. My sadness turned to hate. I would talk about with Raven everything, and how we're both moving on. I would tell her the accounts I made on the site, not telling anyone it was me.\n\nIT TURNS OUT.... Raven was still talking to Roddy. Yup. And she was telling him everything I told her. This wound up resulting in his Harem ladies (all the women he smut with) in stalking my profiles, which freaked me out. It got me paranoid, because these people have MULTIPLE accounts. I'm talking 10-12 each.\n\nI started freaking out. Seeing Roddy as friends to whomever sent me a request or stalked my page.\n\nSo... I do it. I delete everything. All my accounts and passwords from the role play site. Because of Roddy...i can never trust another writing group again.\n\nIf you see someone who plays Bruce, Clark, Strange, Parker, and a few OCs that all sound the fucking same on the exact same site...stay away. Far away. You don't want to get sucked into his black hole.\n\nI barely made it out. But it cost me the will to write because he took that away from me.",

            "selftext": "So, I built a setting that I like to roleplay in. Involves gods, magic, etc etc, pretty bog standard on the surface and most people don't care about the nitty gritty when reading one of these things. \n\nSo I wrote the setting, wrote the Character's of the Gods, and I wrote a handful of lore about them that people in the setting could be able to easily know if they wanted too, so on and so forth. \n\nSo, we're writing, and the players find themselves somewhere they \"shouldn't be\" which usually means they are exactly where I want them to be. It's a temple, very deep underground, a whole bunch of skeletons are laid out very carefully on the ground, and there is a deep blue bottle on the altar. They know Bottles in this setting are some pretty interesting things. So they go and they try to grab it.\n\nThey summoned death in the process. It's their bottle. So on comes the mood lighting, the Party prepares for combat as a single skeleton gets up, with a strange not fire flame burns giving it some look of life.  Problem Player(PP) immediately strikes it down, and it falls to pieces without resistance. \n\n\"*Ow...\"*\n\nThat's all they heard, and the rest of the party notices that and are like \"Hold up\" as another Skeleton gets up, but PP immediately strikes it down again. \n\n\"*Please stop...\"*\n\nParty is like \"Dude, we get it, undead are usually bad, but like... The Skeleton just asked us to stop, we can at least see why it wants us to stop.\"\n\nHe reluctantly agrees, and watches n silence as the party meets Literal Death. The oldest of the deities, and the only one who can truly kill the others in this land. They were around before the gods and the world, and they will be the only one to remain after the gods and the world have been reaped...\n\nAnd she is just the shyest, most timid, whispery thing you will ever meet in you life. Her nickname is the Great Librarian, and if she's around, the last thing you need to worry about is dying, because she actually doesn't want you to die. She wants you to live, because when you do kick the bucket, and you one day will, she wants you to tell her a story that ***deserves*** popcorn with real butter and not that synthetic crap. \n\nOfferings? She wants stories. She just wants to be told stories. You say you wish to giver her an offering, she will sit down cross legged like a child ready for story time and wait for you to tell her a story. Any story. She just soaks it up, and it doesn't matter if someone else has told the story before, it will always be different being told by you. Just don't tell her your life story, or you die. That's the only rule, and she openly tells people this. You will not die, if you have the willpower to not tell her your life story. She's also very motherly when stories aren't being talked about. Encouraging. \"You can do it I believe in you!\" kinda thing, and she's disappointed with Necromancers. She's not mad, just Disappointed. \n\nProblem player fucking hates her. Thinks she is literally the dumbest thing ever written and that I clearly don't understand how to write Death. I ask him why. He says Death is supposed to be this evil thing. You're supposed to fight death, you're supposed to conquer it. Death should be trying to wipe out all life on the planet because that's just how Death is. \n\nI kinda liked my death. You still have to fight her, cause you can't tell her your story. She is kinda scary, but I wanted to get that whole \"Death is scary, but it won't hurt you\" thing going you know? Why can't Death be this thing that makes you feel a little better about your impending doom? That you meet and go \"Wait, this is who is going to care for my soul when I die? Well fuck, that ain't so bad afterall!\" Someone people would want to protect if some crazy hero tried to actually kill her. A friend who you know will bend the rules if you ask her too, and not have any strings or catches. She just wants you to live your best life so she can hear all about it when you die. \n\nIDK, apparently I suck at writing death.",

            "selftext": "Another Bad Roleplay thing, but this is more a vent post than anything?\n\nSo, we all know Literate Posters. These are roleplayers who strive to write as much as they can in a given situation. I get it, you want there to be a standard, and it's usually a way to weed out low effort roleplayers. \n\nSo, first I want to say, when I first started roleplaying in places that didn't have a really low character limit for posts, I was a multi paragraph poster. I was still pretty shit. My posts said a lot, but had nothing to say, you know? I padded out the posts so that people wouldn't get mad at me for not writing enough. Cause people would. \n\nI would pad it out with anything I could. That's not good. Then I joined a roleplay where there was a minimum six paragraph post length requirement, and a paragraph as defined by them was 5-7 sentences, rather than what it actually is. A body of coherent writing that conveys information of a smaller detail in a whole body of writing that has no set length. \n\nIt was insanity. Imagine having to have enough filler to write six beefy paragraphs? So then I inevitably asked. \"How are we supposed to maintain this minimum during a low interaction scene, like a dialogue heavy conversation?\" And they said I should describe things I saw around me. I should talk about the colour of the walls, and the cracks in the window sill, and just get into extreme details regarding the room around me.\n\nMy followup question got me banned. \"Why does any of that matter, if I am talking to John about when Mary was going to come back from the store?\"\n\nI like to say I am an expert of the short post. Short posts are important. Especially in writings that are supposed to imitate the writing in a book. Literary writing's #1 rule is say the most in the least amount of words. It has to be coherent, people need to understand what is going on well enough for theater of the mind to work, and in roleplay you probably have to write just a little more to make sure the other player doesn't create a strange paradox in the setting.\n\nThis isn't to say I only write short posts. I can get a pretty good average of 2 paragraphs, one to respond to the previous post, and the other to give the next in turn order something additional to react too. But I find it so irritating when I write a short post, and there is nothing more I can write that would meaningfully impact the situation. There is nothing more I could write without repeating the same details over and over again. \n\nFor those people who wanna write books who swear by this type of writing, you're just making yourself a worse writer. Being able to write a lot is fine, but it's useless if you don't know how to figure out the stuff the reader needs to know, and throw away the stuff that doesn't push the narrative forward. \n\nIDK, it's irritating to me at least.",

I RP on a forum where I write replies of 350-550 words, except it takes more time bc English is not my first language and I'm a perfectionist (recipe for disaster lmao). \n\nWhen I joined the site, someone asked me to make my character her character's love interest before I even started writing my application (backstory etc.), because she could tell by my Discord msgs that it would be the type of character she would have written a request for. \n\nBut OH MY GOD \\[burning Elmo gif\\] we have been writing the SAME THREAD for over a month now and I was mostly interested until it turned into smut. Bc as it turns out, this player is all about smut and that's unfortunate bc smut does nothing for me personally. \n\nBesides, I had a v specific character idea in mind and it's not really a person you'd want a ship with. But hers isn't, either, and the whole idea was a toxic relationship with two damaged people who are both shitty yet pitiful in their own ways. \n\nBut I don't even think the characters are compatible because (surprise!) they both suck at relationships AND I somehow get this weird feeling like we the 2 players keep misreading each other's (admittedly complicated) characters.\n\nIt's impossible to tell what she thinks of this bc she has literally 200 characters and we don't talk, we just tag each other on Discord, and I don't wanna bother her or just \"cancel\" the thread. So rn I'm trying to get out of that \"trying to survive this and hoping she likes it\" mindset to \"trying to enjoy this and writing what I want\". But it's difficult bc I like to take my time and she replies to *everybody* in like 5 hours max.\n\nOkay long rant but **I also have questions for you guys.** How do you decide who to reply to first? Their speed or your mood? Do you think it's rude to reply to one person but not the other?",
