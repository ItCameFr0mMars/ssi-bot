            "selftext": "A bit NSFW\n\nI've all but completely removed myself from various RP communities because, as a female gamer (both tabletop and video) I am so fucking sick of the r/niceguys that pervade the community.  \n\nI'm sick of going to tabletop conventions and having some idiot point out that \"I was raised right so I'm holding open this door\" and then IMMEDIATELY following it up with \"also, the view is nice\" before pointedly staring at my ass.  I'm sick of having online mmo rp friends that decide after months of only being in group chat with me, that it's time to pile on me why their still virgins and talk to me about it like I'm their representative for every female in existence.  Then when you try to offer advice they're like \"well you wouldn't date me so what's the point?\"  This was said to me immediately after my separation from the military btw, while I was recovering from severe combat related PTSD and a danger to anyone sharing a bed with me.  And then listening to them pile on for MONTHS the damn guilt comments about how I'm \"offering advice when you still won't give me a chance because I'm too nice!\"  \n\nThe ultimate r/niceguy of my roleplay life has wormed his shitty self back into my world though my girlfriend.  He was our FC leader and would give the nice guy talk to literally anyone who came into the FC with 2Xs.  We were in his FC for YEARS and stayed because we respected the work he put in pushing our FC forward.  And of course, he'd have good stretches.  Then it'd be \"I'm going to die a virgin\", \"no one ever gives me a chance\", \"you aren't interested in me so why do I bother?\"  My girlfriend and I hid our relationship from the whole FC until about 2 months after we'd moved in together solely because we knew he'd take it like two of his \"only chances\" were now off the market.  \n\nWe'd thought he'd taken it okay, but then he started with the jokes.  Jokes that made it extremely clear he was using us as sexual fantasies.  Extreme detail on how he thought we were having sex but always with that tone of longing.  Finally I told him to cut it out and he told me \"The only reason you're with \\_\\_\\_ instead of me is because I want my genetic line to continue.\"  (My gf can't have kids)  \n\nNow, my girlfriend has never expressed a sliver of interest in him romantically.  She's always made sure to keep herself firmly as \"one of the guys\" but she's been a much closer friend to him than myself.    He has never asked my girlfriend out either, and when I pointed this out he just said they'd always been \"close\".  This is true, but in a friendship sense and never anything else.  Hell, she'd been in a relationship legit the whole time he knew her (all girls btw) with the exception of a month or two between each relationship.  \n\nI wish I could say we cut him out then, but no, we stayed friends because FC drama was also going on at the time and we wanted to show solidarity.  We didn't leave until he kept us up one night complaining about the FC \"traitors\" until 4 in the morning the day of my practical exam and, when I told him I needed to sleep or I'd definitely fail, he told me \"I hope you DO fail\".  He, of course, claims he never said this in spite of over half the FC having been in that voice chat (we'd been trying to help him) and hearing him.\n\nNow he's back 3 years later, talking to my girlfriend on Discord, but he's basically just messaging her every month or so in cycles.  \"Oh hi I'm doing so much better, here's all the mental health steps I've been taking\", followed by clear signs that he's lying and exactly the same as he always was when he finds out we're still together, and then he drops off for another month.  He's never tried to message me thank the gods, because I'd probably say something cruel to him that I'd regret.  I honestly think he's just fishing to see if she's available every so often, or waiting for an opening to sow drama.  \n\nThe dumb shit is, that he actually IS a nice guy when he's not being an obsessive jackass.  He's not an incel, I never once heard him pulling any \"guys are better than girls\" at video games bs, and I've never heard him \"mainsplain\" (hate that word) anything.   He's got this really cool passion for cooking, loved and took care of his grandmother, dealt with insanely useless parents whose bills he still helps pay, and he's smart as hell.  But through his obsession with finding a girlfriend/wife through RP he's become this desperate asshole.  \n\nRP communities are first and foremost for RP.  If a relationship falls into your lap, great!  But don't ruin other's experiences, forcing them to start completely over, by being mad at them for not being your soulmate.  \n\nDisclaimer: Yes, I know \"not all guys are like this\" but if you feel the need to point that out you almost certainly are \"like this\" in some way.  There are tons of amazing folks of all genders that I've RPed with but, in my nearly 20 years of RP experience, nothing brings my RP to a halt quite like a \"nice guy\".  There are conventions I don't even go to anymore because that door guy example above is a DM at tables there.  I don't let guys buy me ANYTHING, not a soda, not a cookie, not a damn thing.  Even when I know they're just buying for the table, because I need to honestly be able to turn down every single random ass gift I'm offered by a rp buddy who then proceeds to invite himself to a football game I have tickets for.  I can't wear a damn dress in the summer because guys at my table have thought I'm hitting on them when I do.  These guys are the minority by FAR, but they definitely do a lot of damage.",

            "selftext": "I know I've been dramatic and that I've been posting so frequently on the sub, but please just hear me out. I actually have something to share for once. Basically, a \"friend\" who I'll be naming Quo had just abandoned me out of the blue. After everything we've been through, he just straight up ignores my existence. I listened to his rp gripes, his worst partners, his worse servers, etc... I've even rp'd through plot lines that nobody would want to do with his character. Though, I'll admit, some of them just made him the \"protagonist\" of his own adventure while ignoring that  the canon characters actually exist. Sometimes we'd retcon or ignore plot points and that doesn't stop there. We'd even make up a new AU just for him to be satisfied, which I'll admit, is partially my fault since I was desperate at the time to break from my other circle of friends. After all, there's just so much pokemon rps you could do until your head spins off.  \n\n\n  \nA few moments after i joined the discord server and got to know mostly everyone, someone pops up in my dms and asks if I'd like to rp with them. Being the gullible shite that I was, I accepted without having any boundaries, limitations, or anything like a fool. Every post was about his character and not even mine. I eventually wised up and knew what he was doing and confronted him, but I was just too lonely and in the mindset that \"nobody wants me\", so I kept him around even after he made excuses. He even said shit like, \"Let's continue so you don't make me mad\" or something along those lines that struck one of my nerves, but I still didn't leave. Fast forward to now... and well, we're not friends any more.  \n\n\nBefore we stopped talking, he just went off about himself and ignored most of my messages. I guess he's moved on to become a better person than me at the moment. I kinda feel used and abused right now, (and very bitter) to the point where I'm considering dropping this hobby, but it's made me suspect that nobody I know really cares that much since they barely respond to me. I know the adults in my life actually have excuses, but my friends don't really come around as much. Yet, I still want to roleplay my interests even though it might be near impossible.",

            "selftext": "I started this RP a few weeks ago and at first, it was great! I feel like I really click with this person, I love their writing style and I think they're also enthusiastic about the RP. Pretty much all you could ever want from an RP! But I don't know lately is just feels so freaking heavy and I'm not sure if I'm just overreacting or if I'm too sensitive for this kind of RP.\n\nSome background, the RP is a take on West Side Story so two people that belong to two separate groups at war with each other. Naturally characters will make decisions that will drive a wedge between the two character, there will be dire consequences to their actions and I firmly believe that every action should have a reaction. However, it just feels like my character is constantly getting a far more emotionally devastating reaction. For example, (I'll just refer to the characters as Romeo and Juliet because that's what's happening here) Juliet and Romeo are at a party and Juliet saves her friends from being caught by Romeo allowing them to get away and Romeo to fail his mission. He gets so pissed at her, and now not only doe her fellow group members not trust her (because how was she to survive Romeo's clutches since he is a known badass in the RP) but now Romeo is pissed at her because she got in the way of his mission. Things just go downhill from there, she tries to make up but he's cold to her the entire time. She tries to warn him against an assassination attempt against his uncle, but it a little too late and now he wants to kill her. \n\nI'm sorry if my explanation is long-winded, honestly I just needed to rant I suppose. I don't know, it makes me feel like no matter what she does, she'll be met with hatred and disgust. Although I feel like that's very tragic and interesting, in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis.... I don't know, it's really starting to get to me. \n\nSo, I don't know am I being too sensitive? How could I have prevented this? Should I consider taking a break from Rping all together? Help!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I am sorry but my story might seem a bit lengthy. And I'm also sorry for any English mistakes you may spot. English is not my first language.\n\nI have been roleplaying over a decade. I have been a frequent forum and boards user since 2005 to 2011 before I have moved to the other sites. A couple of years ago I met my rping partner. I even started dating him a bit later. From a one couple only we went to having many other ships and characters for us to explore.\n\nHowever, I learned as the time goes by, that I am not enjoying the stories as much as I thought that I am originally. I stuck with my partner over nearly 2 years. Some of them became a chore to reply on. Some of them turned just into a never-ending ERP where it feels like characters never leave the bed. I tried to nicely issue a complaint about it and suggest a few ideas for us to brainstorm, but this would never work out.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I can write ERP, but I feel like I am in a minority who doesn't really want for it to take over the whole story idea - if that makes any sense? I prefer indulging in the story a lot more than writing sex. For me, the sex in roleplaying can it even be non-existent. I get a far bigger pleasure developing characters themselves and seeing their growth. \n\nUntil it became even more tiring. My partner started to make touches on my characters. He didn't like it that one of my characters being witches, so he started to retouch on its abilities and what it can do, and what it can't do. Which actually did hurt me. Because we were already in the middle of roleplaying when he started to do it and I started to argue with him over this, which only it led to him not understanding me at all, and only saying that \"I'm glad that you agree with me\". Which I did not and tried to tell him my point of a view.\n\nAlso, then I made one of my characters lawyers. I even mentioned it in one of her replies I have done. In his next reply, she suddenly becomes a cheerleader at his character's high school (which makes it even more creepy, no?). \n\nNot also forgetting to mention, that it was the most straight-forward and blatant narcissistic .\"Everyone tries to copy and paste the face claims I use', \"see how creative I am? I even use music and images to create the atmosphere\".\n\nHe openly started to mention which ships he started to dislike and why he would not reply to me. And I was supposed to react in any sort of a way. But yet whenever I would mention any flaws that I felt like we should be working out together, he would ignore them and let it slip past his fingers. \n\nAnd yet he would be surprised why I don't take more advantage and an upper hand in my writing to create more ideas. I didn't want to do that anymore. I felt like I can't outdo and be better than him, losing my voice in an order.\n\nAs the straws continued to pile on, I honestly broke everything off with him. I grew way too exhausted. I think it is one of the days when you wake up and realize that enough is enough and you can't do it anymore. Especially ,if you are not enjoying it.\n\nI will be honest. 2 years later I don't regret a thing and I am so happy. It was the best decision ever. I have never came back to re-read any of the roleplays we've had. I think it only shows how much I don't miss roleplaying with him. But I felt like I should share my story with everyone and someone might find it even relating. \n\nI developed a serious anxiety issue about rping. There were days when I feel like I don't want to do any replies yet I would force myself. I felt like I am not good enough and that my partner is the only one with all the ideas.  My anxiety is a lot better and I think that it is because this person is off of my life. But yet at the same time, I get anxiety over rping again. \n\nI have not roleplayed since spring 2019 .This was the last time I really tried with different people and while I have found lovely people, they would ghost me. And ever since then I really have not tried to roleplay :( I feel like I am never good enough for anyone. \n\nWriting has always been one of my passions. Sometimes I still daydream about roleplaying with other people but I don't think that I am able to find people who would stick with me. (Plus, my interests are a lot more in the fantasy/superheroes/magickal lane).",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been roleplaying for around 2 years now. Here and other sites. I really enjoy it. Writing for characters that I love and creating my own are so fun. Especially for ERP. I usually prefer to RP smut and romance. Luckily, I\u2019ve only come across one partner that was a bit toxic. They once hit me up and noticed I was a fan of a celebrity. They said they wanted to play her for me and I could play myself, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m actually living a fantasy. It seemed fun at first, but then they wanted me to give a lot of irl info I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing.\n\nThey asked for my first name. I was fine with that. But then they pushed harder. They wanted me to describe myself. I gave fake details so they would get off my back.  They started to manipulate me into a sort of online relationship. Toying with the fact that I was just very generous. Subtly being manipulative and toxic. I sort of played along at first and wish I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just not the type for online relationships. Then they started requesting that I sent photos. That\u2019s a big no for me. I said no. I just don\u2019t enjoy it. They kept pushing and said stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d \u201cjust do it\u201d. I should\u2019ve just ignored them but I tried to keep them calm, continuing forwarding got creepy. Requesting I give my last name for RP purposes, photos of my genitalia and vids of me doing stuff. Again, I should\u2019ve just blocked them and left but I wanted to give them one last chance. Reminding them that I was already a bit out of my comfort zone and that I really enjoy playing more as characters. They quickly stopped and continued on and eventually ghosted and blocked me. \n\nI just hate other role-players who try to get you to step out of your comfort zone, and are clearly trying to manipulate you into giving more info then your comfortable with.",

We were in a giant space ship, I was taking potatoes from the space farm to make the illicit alcohol. The bootlegger wasn't supposed to be my partner, as he was playing a space-cop.\n\nMy plan was to have the merchant scramble to get the cop out of the shop by offering him overpriced wares, closing up the shop in front of him, and leading the cop away from the premises. Instead, the cop decided to be the bootlegger.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a funny rp session turned into a drug deal. You can't exactly fit jars of shine into your police jacket. The whole conversation kinda dragged on. I tried to find an out by asking for info on the ship's government, but he said \"nope, nothing\".\n\nHe left and that was the end of the first session.\n\nSo, my questions for you guys, was it unreasonable to expect a cop to, you know, be a cop? Should I have made it more obvious?\n\nShould I have had a lil' session zero with him to figure things out? It was a public discord server. So I usually try to let things organically happen.",

            "selftext": "I'm slowly tiring of people who join RP's, claim to have idea's and then a short time later just bumble around the OOC topics saying they're bored. It's a small thing, I know but you hear it enough and it gets draining especially if you're one running the forum, or trying to get events going.\n\n\nLike, okay, fine. You're allowed to be bored when there's a lull, or no one is around to RP wit. Heck, you're even free to leave if it's not what you're looking for. But these are often people with character's accepted and free, but it's like they're just wanting a plot to fall into their lap with no work on their part! \n\n\nMost of the time there's nothing in their initial I'm bored statements. No asking if anyone around can chat, or plot together, no offering of scenes or idea's that could move things along in the RP. And then when I have tried to offer them idea's in the past, it's like I need to be the one to come up with the idea's and tell them what their roles could be in such a scene. There's very little input from them.\n\n\nIt can be creatively demanding for the RP'ers who would see the \"I'm bored\" and offer idea after idea until their own creativity for whatever setting the forum is in dies out. I've lost total interest in entire genre's over that before. And from a moderating standpoint it's downright demoralizing sometimes when you just want to be able to step away for a day, a few hours and do something else and they've just stalled and grumbled about being bored.\n\n\nIt's not a surefire phrase that means all of the above, but in my experience when someone says I'm bored or something like that in the chat? Well, odds are these things are what is gonna follow.",

            "selftext": "Does anyone have this one friend in the roleplay community who has their character shipped with their roleplay partner's character?\n\nI do...Well 'did'.\n\nThis happened back when I roleplayed on Instagram last year. I met this person there, we'll call her Foster.\n\nShe seemed like a cool person. We would joke, laugh, and having interesting conversations. I did see her profile and saw that her character is shipped with another character, which was cool because I always liked other people creating stories together on their posts and bring their creativity to life.\n\nThen this happened.\n\nFoster came to me, depressed, saying that her roleplay partner broke it off because they lost interest and life is constantly in the way from preventing them to roleplay any longer. It happens to everyone and we all have that right? I have that. I see it as normal in roleplay. I know others do not. (Question: How do you take it when someone saying they don't want roleplay because of that same reason? I'm curious.) Let's just say Foster didn't take quite lightly...At all.\n\nShe would from this nice and happy go to person, to a...(what's the word in order to be nice? Stalker? No...Harasser? Alright guess use that) harasser. She sent me screenshots of her messaging her now formerly roleplay partner to give her another chance, their reply is a hard no, for that same reason and she wouldn't stop crying about it (literally). I was sympathetic at first, but after seeing her creating over 4 accounts just to roleplay with the same person is too much. Those 5 of accounts she owned are now in the former partner's block list.\n\nFoster had the nerve to use me as a last resort, I said no because for one, it is none of my business and two, I want no part of it. I always had to talk to her and say that there are plenty of other people who will be your roleplay partner and there is no point to go after on person. Sadly, Foster never listened. She continued to harass her former roleplay partner and got the extreme to where she found their IRL profile on Instagram. The harassment continues.\n\nI had enough of hearing the entire thing and decided to block Foster and all of her accounts. As for her former roleplay partner, I pretty much assume they dropped the face of the earth or created an account that Foster isn't aware of. Just hope something like this doesn't happen to everyone...\n\nPeople like Foster do need to learn that when it's over, it's over.\n\nPlease be careful who you meet in the roleplay community. No matter what site or app you're in. You may never know if the next person you meet could be like Foster...\n\nToday: Foster is still blocked on my account until recently I discovered that her accounts are deactivated and her main account was reported due to harassment. I heard that she made another account, chances are that she still might be harassing them or moved on.",

            "selftext": ".....yet demands you accomodate the rp to suit THEIR needs. I think it's obvious this going to be yet another story about an entitled rper and a vent in one post. Buckle up this will be a big one.\n\nA little back story before we start:\n\nI'm a person who dabbles in the (only slightly) more easier way of rping. This means I prefer something original created between me and another person rather than having to abide by the rules of a fandom or prewritten world. I do still get those desires from time to time to put myself in the shoes of character who I've watched on TV or my own character in a world that's different to the universe I write them in but not so vastly different that it can't be worked into the setting the show is set in. \n\nHow is that little slice of information relevant? Why not read the story below and see for yourself.\n\nI have been somewhat idle during these days of panic and chaos amongst covid 19 and the need to stay inside so that of course means that I'd been binge watching all my favourite shows on Netflix (and eating ice cream. You can't not eat ice cream whilst watching Netflix.) and it was whilst watching my absolute favourite show that an idea formed in my brain and the itch to write got to me. Every one, well, most people hopefully, knows what Voltron is whether you've seen all the series or simply legendary defender (the one I'm fairly sure everyone is familiar with) you'll at least know it's got something to do with five lions that form a very awesome robot.\n\nAfter dragging myself away from the tv I wrote down the main points of what I wanted in the rp and what it would be about. I stayed very, very, VERY clearly that shipping was not a key priority in the rp and if you want to ship two canon characters together than you have to play as the pair since I find rping solely as a canon character kinda ruins the fun. In no way am I against it, it's just that most rpers will be obsessed that you play the character as if you're reading their show scripts........yet they're somehow okay with rewriting an entire characters personality to suit the ship.......two sides of the very same coin really. I also put out that I don't double or play multiples after another incident where I was requested to play ten+ characters and was rather rudely insulted in the process when all ten characters weren't in the same paragraph. Something very important I made sure of was to point out that this was an alternate take on what happened during season seven (or eight..... can't remember specifically but it was between the two.) when after the galra invasion is taken care of the paladins stay behind on earth to train cadets to fly their own animal space ships. It also mixes lore from two previous Voltron series (I made it quite clear that any potential partners had to have seen only one series and I would happily fill them in on details) and personal head canons as well as what we come up with together. \n\nAfter the ads were posted I then sat back and waited,and waited. Then waited some more and before too long it was two months since the ads were posted and I still got no one. I thought perhaps I was being too picky and demanding too much by drastically altering the canon time line or perhaps it was the shipping thing that was turning people away. I liked to think that my requests were more than reasonable. One day I awoke to a friend request on discord and I opened it. Huzzah! It was a response to the ad I put up!\n\nI bet you're all thinking this is the best case scenario isn't it? Nope. Not even close. Within five seconds of me saying hello the rper, whom we shall dub K in honour of her first request, bombarded me with a wall of text begging me to do a klance rp. The words \"please do this no one ever wants to rp klance\" was more than enough to warrant an eye roll. No one ever not wants to do klance in the Voltron fandom. I said no, politely pointed out that I don't do shipping only  rp's and sent them a copy of the ad so that they could reread it. After (hopefully) rereading my ad K apologised and tried to brush it off as a joke. They did seem to want to and were willing to put the effort into the rp so I decided to give them a chance.\n\nI really should've left right there and then because when I introduced my OC K went ballistic and claimed that my species was a copy pasta of the galra despite the obvious differences I pointed out (galra genes are recessive in hybrids, they all look different and range from mammalian to reptilian in appearance where my species is strictly mammalian and their genes are dominant). They went on trying to tell me how an alien looking hybrid was then going against canon (it really doesn't. Peeps rp the half alien dude as looking like an alien more than half the time) and that I couldn't rp with that character. I was starting to lose my cool by this time and I warned K that I was incredibly close to calling it off. They apologised once more and offered to write a starter as proof of apology. \n\nI REALLY should've said no to that cause when I woke up and checked discord the next morning to find that they'd written a starter about my character fucking one of the canon characters and calling him daddy. I was disgusted because they'd literally just written a smut fest starter of my character doing things he'd never do with a person who is considered his teacher. Forget the fact that the character is the age of consent, teacher/ student relationships are unequal power fetishes. I wrote K a polite message thanking them for their time but that I didn't think this was gonna work before blocking them.\n\nSadly to this day I've still not found a decent partner and am still reeling in disgust at what literally occurred less than a week ago. I guess I was giving a crash course in fandom toxicity.",

            "selftext": "So I'm in this RP community where most of the RP is done in-game on a server -- let's call it Wayfarer. The setting is space cyberpunk with some D&amp;D-style fantasy and post-apocalyptic stuff on the side. Anywho, I had an admin's character (let's call the admin Griselda) convince my character (i.e., Alice) to walk into the diner that Griselda's character worked in. Then the diner was locked by another staff member's character (let's call that staff member Fariq) and Alice asked that character why the door was locked. After being told it's \"after hours\" ICly, Alice then talked with Griselda's character. After a bit of IC chit-chat, Griselda then asked me if I consented to anything, and I said no. This is where the real shit begins.\n\nYou see, there's this rule on Wayfarer where any character may take minor injuries for any reason without consent. Now, another staff member's character (let's call this staff member Tigger) went and tried to smash Alice's head into a diner table, which would most certainly give Alice a concussion and a broken nose, neither of which readily heal within 2 IC days (which is the definition of \"minor injury\" as per the rules). I had Alice dodge the face-slam and try to break out of the restaurant she was now trapped in, but Fariq quite conveniently said that the glass was bulletproof, meaning Alice was unable to get out. Then Fariq and Tigger tried to have their characters basically flay Alice and break bones (as far as I remember).\n\nThat's when I called for a timeout and demanded to talk to other staff about this. Griselda tried to explain that Alice had ample warning before entering the criminal diner because Griselda's character was suddenly behaving too nicely -- the only problem here is that I hadn't been given any OOC indication that entering the restaurant means my character will be badly beaten up or worse.\n\nThings got more heated because I now wanted to quit the combat RP; such an action is known as \"combat logging\" on Wayfarer. My character hadn't even retaliated or swung punches at anyone, so well, I felt that \"combat logging\" would be the right thing here. Now, Fariq showed me that, if I \"combat logged\",  Alice would be murdered and her corpse would be eaten by a demonic abomination residing in the cyberpunk city's underbelly as punishment for not continuing the combat RP that I basically got myself forced into. (Wayfarer's standard policy for \"combat logs\" is that the quitter loses all consent, even against death, upon quitting, even if the quitter didn't start the combat RP or retaliate against other characters -- this includes self-defence -- before quitting.)\n\nNow, Wayfarer does have character revival, but I didn't want my character killed in the first place, because it would disrupt ongoing plots and stuff I had with other RPers. Of course, I was informed by Fariq in a rather toxic manner that \"combat logging\" basically forfeits all consent, even if done out of frustration and aggravation, which only aggravated me more, so I asked for a complete void, which they refused (both sides have to consent for a void on Wayfarer). Fariq then went and spoiled to me the ongoing plot line that gave his character and others justification to kill and injure other people's characters who wander into the diner, after having me promise to keep it secret. In the end, I did have to \"combat log\", getting my character killed.\n\nSince I'm also staff on Wayfarer (but not RP staff), I ended up reporting this shit in staff chat on Wayfarer's Discord server, but it only ended up in multiple other staff members ganging up on me. (Now, as a side note, it's been known for a while that some of the staff are toxic, and I've frequently had to tell other staff to stop interrupting serious discussions with shitposts and keep their shitposting in the correct channel on the Discord server. Yes, other *staff*.)\n\nAnywho, they finally managed to let up and offered to let Alice go with only minor injuries, but I demanded that they stop randomly attacking and ganging on my characters (which had been a problem for several months know) as part of the deal. That proviso was rejected, and I only got more aggravated. Then Griselda and Fariq went on to say my characters was killed and the deal is off the table -- I was put on a fucking timer. Upon further prodding, the final \"deal\" where my character was killed and I received *no* concessions was revealed to be non-negotiable and I couldn't get it voided or retconned anymore, which left me \\*really\\* aggravated.\n\nNow, there are other staff members on the server who were pissed with Fariq and Griselda's behaviour and tried to work with me (and them) to try to get a better deal, but didn't get anything through since Griselda's an admin and we're not. Also, the other admins we asked invoked their usual \"we never override refusals to void if the override is for OOC reasons\" policy, which I find infuriating.\n\nFortunately, when I got my character revived by admins the next day, I was able to arrange the revival such that neither Alice, nor my characters, nor many other RPers' characters know that Alice died and was revived, which basically neutralises the effects of her bullshit death in the RP and allows me and others to RP our headcanon where the death was voided without staff getting on my case. It's not quite as good as a full void, but it'll have to do, since getting the admins to void their \"official\" canon wasn't going to happen. Also, Fariq's friend (whom we'll call Tucker) insulted me and generally acted like a toxic little shit all the way through, which obviously didn't help with my aggravation.\n\nNow, I'm asking what kind of advice you guys would give me regarding this matter. Should I quit Wayfarer? (Hard to do so when it's the most popular and active RP community for the game we RP in and most of my RP friends also RP there due to its popularity.) Am I the asshole for not accepting the staff's \"Alice gets away with minor injuries and her stuff stolen\" proposal without my \"staff need to stop coming up with transparently bullshit IC excuses to gang up on my characters\" proposal?",
