Someone else comes in and makes a copy character.   \n\n\nImo, it's the Admin/GM's job to reject the copy character. I get *some* similarities here and there are going to happen. I'm talking about full on **copies.**  \n\n\nExample:   \n\n\nI joined a Supernatural-themed Slice of Life server that was basically a small southern town. Think True Blood. My character was the only vampire, since the server was relatively new. My character originated in France. Before she was turned, she came from a family that hunted werewolves to keep their village safe. She was born in 1687. She worked as a bartender at a pub in town. She had pale skin, brown eyes, a strong jaw line, and super long curly brown hair.   \n\n\nTwo new people joined as a duo right after me. Both made vampires. Cool.   \nThe female made a vampire who, before she was turned, was from a village in France where her family hunted werewolves to keep the village safe. She had brown eyes, pale skin, a strong jaw line, super long curly brown hair. She got a job as a bartender at the same pub. She was born in 1686.   \n\n\nAt first, I thought, \"obviously the Staff won't approve this.\" But they did. I kept my peace for a few days. Then the girl was in the out of character chat talking about original her character was, and I just about lost my shit. And in the end, I was the one who was told to leave because I was \"the only one with a problem.\"  \n\n\nAs an Admin for my own server now, I will actively bar any application from being processed if I see it's too similar to an already existing player's character because I know how shitty that is. But I've seen other Admins who are so thirsty to fill up their servers that they let copy after copy into their stories with no regard for how their players feel about it. They say \"intellectual property isn't a thing in RP.\"   \n\n\nA lot of the characters I see are OCs, made by and for a particular player who put a ton of time into that character. I will never understand GMs that just allow that shit, especially because you *know* the moment someone makes a copy of the GM's character they're going to shit 12 bricks simultaneously.   \n\n\nThat's some bull shit.",

She was hurt and still had to perform. With all the pressure she was facing, was it really her own decision to do so? Henry seemed to be forcing her quite a bit. But regardless of this, Gulliver did not say anything and made sure that his emotions did not show.\n\nHer. Even though Gulliver did not say anything, Lee (Henrys son) noticed that he seemed concerned. He looked at him and said '(something that is intended to paint Henry in a good light).'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning, I was okay with it. I thought: Well maybe it is possible that you can guess what kind of emotions Gulliver is experiencing, it is not totally impossible after all so it's okay. But after a while, I noticed that my play partner always does this is my character even dares to think something negative about one of her characters...and that rubs me the wrong way.\n\nIf I write 'He did not let it show' this means you can't tell he is thinking that. Can the other person guess that he might be thinking this? Yeah, but he can't always guess right.  I am annoyed that every thought about her characters has to be positive or it will turn into a discussion, even though he did not even voice his opinion on the matter.\n\nMy character is a bit dumb and rather immoral sometimes, so really not the type of person who makes the best judgements about people or their intentions. So I do not even know why my playpartner can't 'allow' him to ask himself if something is right or wrong without making sure that he will end up basically worshipping her characters.\n\nAny advice about how to bring this up to her? Because in the end, it would be possible for her character to guess my characters emotions, just not always in these kind of situations...",

I'm mostly on Discord now, but I've used Elliquiy, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, AOL, AIM, Yahoo, Rolepages, etc.   \n\n\nThere's one thing I've seen happen more often than not and it never fails to give me the simultaneous reaction of being both amused and overwhelmingly annoyed. Without fail, there's always, at least, one person who will watch for anyone of their preferred romantic gender to come in and they just *pounce* before they've read the lore, before they've even started making a character.   \n\n\nIt's  like X is a woman who plays female characters.   \nY comes in and is clearly looking to play a male character.   \nX will privately message them before anyone on the staff has a chance to even properly welcome them and start talking to Y about their character and heavily suggesting that Y makes a character that's auto-paired and in love with X's character.   \n\n\nI've seen it happen with every possible combination of gender or sexuality. There's always that one person in every group that does it. But they don't *only* do it once to get their character a gf/bf. They'll do it several times and create a weird little harem/love triangle for their character. The majority of the time, they'll do it without telling the other players they're doing it.  Eventually, one of the other players finds out that their character is essentially being turned into a cuck, they get pissed, they leave.   \n\n\nI really don't understand the logic of people like this. Typically, if I see it happening in my server, the person doing it gets 1 warning. If it happens again, we ban them. Now, I totally get some people liking to play love triangles or harem types of stories, my question, really, is why not just be upfront about that to your writing partners?   \n\n\nGive them the chance to make an educated decision for their character with all the information. Because otherwise, you're effectively lying to other players and making them feel bad and eventually leave the story they're in, which hurts the group you're in.   \n\n\nWhy? Why why why? I'd rather be ghosted a hundred times over than deal with being lied to and having my character end up looking like an idiot because of this. Additionally, most of the times that I've seen this, it's more that they've been lied to and had the ability to give informed consent taken from them than it is actually about  having their characters cheated on.",

Possible trigger warnings: amputations, roofies, one moron.\n\nI do a lot of kink-based rps - until now - because I like them. They\u2019re interesting and introduce me to things I would never consider otherwise. I watch videos, read stories, I research so I can be a good partner and that\u2019s my choice. I never regret that effort. Anyway I agreed to an amputee roleplay - and medicine is my thing - that has turned me off of my kink streak. \n\nHe listed the milestones the story was to hit. I swing by after a party because I left my purse with him. We fight. I get hit by a truck. He is a surgeon and amputations occur. He agreed to my terms of what he was allowed to remove (just the legs).\n\nSo I do my part and try to start the fight by being hungover and pissy and instead I am talked into a movie. Fine, I agree to that. But then he roofies my water which was never discussed but hey, I\u2019m a laid back chick so I\u2019ll drink the water. \n\nApparently I \u2018slept funny and my legs turned purple,\u2019 and the good doctor \u2018panics\u2019 **his words** and amputates on the kitchen table. Well now I\u2019m worried about infection. Did he clean that table after the party? Because the rest of the house was trashed. \n\nBut then he told me my arms \u2018turned purple\u2019 *apropos of nothing* and he removed them too. I politely said that wasn\u2019t agreed upon and I can\u2019t continue this and he suggested we try a different story instead. So I said we were incompatible and I blocked him. I\u2019m not asking to do this with an actual surgeon but all his character did was smile and then tell me things were purple. I couldn\u2019t suspend my disbelief and my imagination is already pretty out there. But...\n\nMy character was *nothing* like me. So why do *I* feel mildly traumatized from this? I\u2019m not new to this arena, but I\u2019m new to this sense of unease and I\u2019m not sure what to do with it.",

I've joined a good sum of servers where the main focus seems to be aesthetics and it's getting tiring. \"We require not only a face claim but also additional pictures, or you to use this overly stylish and filler filled sheet.\" Why? Why is my OC's favorite color or blood type that important? Or why is a fair written description no longer feasible for a character? Is this not a writing hobby? Not everyone feels morally right using a random person's face or stealing art, you know. And what's up with these crazy 3+ paragraph minimums and heavy reliance on Discord Bots for immersion?\n\n It's not to say I don't appreciate the time put in to making it nice or having a unique aesthetic for a world/character, but when that's more of a focus than the writing. (Which tends to be overly flowery nonsense/a wall of text that otherwise could've been a paragraph and had been just as powerful.) \nAnd it's alienating any potential rpers who don't care for all that; it's just making it hard to get back into all this as somebody who wants to. What alternative platforms or search terms do you guys think I can familiarize myself with to find more lax writing focused places?",

It can span a pretty wide spectrum of emotions, dynamics, and themes! It has a fairly predictable \"arc,\" which makes it easy to do one-shots or develop into larger stories! It is a fun way to flex your writing muscles, explore some character traits, practice descriptive writing, and make something sexy in the process.\n\nObviously it's not everyone's cup of tea, but there are SO MANY RP servers and RP communities that are SFW-only so I just don't understand the constant disdain for smutty RPers just *existing* in spaces where they're allowed to be. \n\nI also don't understand, and this is what sparked this vent, when people connect or message you about a prompt or ad when you're very clear that you're looking for a smut-focused RP, to tell you that they're \"willing to do SOME smut\" but \"need a LOT of buildup and development first\" because they're \"tired of everyone wanting their characters to just hop into bed and fuck\"\n\nLike why would you reach out to me and immediately neg the type of RP I explicitly stated I was looking for? I don't connect with people who are wanting to plot out long, dramatic epics like \"ok but I hate all that plot shit, here's my f-list,\" because I know they'd (justifiably!) block me and get a ton of validation venting about gross people who like to RP smut. Why is it okay the other way around??\n\nLike. I get it. SO many people who focus on ERP have a lot of issues with boundaries. This is probably more frustrating to navigate as someone who *wants* to do a lot of ERP than someone who just avoids it entirely. It just sucks to be made to feel like a gross and bad person when I'm trying my hardest to be upfront about what I'm looking for, and stick to RP communities where it's allowed/encouraged.",

            "selftext": "So I had this role play where there are two princesses, one well known and the other not so much but the king of an other kingdom wanted to marry the known sister rather than the other but the not so popular princess ended up marrying him because the known sister didn\u2019t want to marry him. Sounds confusing I know, this isn\u2019t the whole plot so tries narrowing down the main points.\n\nANYWAY!\n\nso I played the unknown princess but this princess spent her time in the training grounds while everyone pays attention to the other princess. My character basically knows how to wield a sword and do simple combat. But when facing off in a battle, my partner decided to annoy me:\n\nMe: Sylvia pointed the sword at the man, her breaths hitched as her eyes darted from him to the wounded woman on the floor. \u201cI do not wish to kill you, but if I have to, I will.\u201d She said taking a step closer, he was a mere meter away but if she could reach him in time, she can get the woman to safety. The man smirked up at her, reaching for his back. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to kill me.\u201d He said arrogantly, pulling the sword from behind. Sylvia gripped her sword, charging forward.\n\n(LET ME BE CLEAR, this isn\u2019t how I role play because it would\u2019ve have way more paragraphs but I don\u2019t want this post to be long and dreading so I shortened it ..ALOT)\n\nSo that isn\u2019t how I usually write but it\u2019s an example and then my lovely to partner will do that:\n\nHim: Astria noticed his wife on the battlefield, sword pointed at the betrayer that was once his best friend. Austria knew his wife couldn\u2019t fight\u2014 not without him at least\u2014 she\u2019ll be overpowered. Astria kicked his last victim to the fall, running over to his wife before the man could hit her, Astria slashed his sword near the man abdomen, making him collapse to the floor.\n\nThis is what pisses me off the most because 1) my character been training so she can hold her ground, 2) they are completely shifting the story because we agreed to let her fight and get hurt in process blah blah. I hate when my partners think my characters are weak and fight a whole battle while my character stays silent and does nothing.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether or not to end the role play to be honest.",

I reply in a respective polite manner and we talk back and forth about getting the feel and the flow of things...Then after 1 reply from my side later...Ghosted. I'm sure we all get this shit right? Right? I get that we all have lives. I get that we all get busy. I, myself do have a busy life and do get busy too.\n\nAgain. I post a prompt got someone who may be a potential partner...Bye bye they go.\n\nFor the love of god...Fucking stop! Do not say that you're interested in people's roleplay ideas and ghost them. You're wasting their time and yours with that bullshit. Not only that, it also makes the person get their hopes up in finding a roleplay partner.\n\n*This doesn't apply to my roleplay buddies. They're the best.

A little light chat, roleplay, a couple jokes. I was fine with that!\nNow he has started to manipulate me, saying he\u2019ll leave because he\u2019ll be too upset when I get a boyfriend irl. To me this sounded ridiculous and I soon realised he was saying all this just so I would beg him to stay...which i\u2019ve stopped doing.\nThe truth is I do lack self confidence and a bit of courage so I think I do end up with guys who can be a bit manipulative of me.

            "selftext": "So I made a similar statement on another post I\u2019ll share later. But I wanted to elaborate more on unbalanced races. Why do people make races that include races without powers and races with powers and have no consequences?\n\nLet me say this, no one, unless they want a challenge, they don\u2019t want to play a character with no powers. That instantly puts your character as the weakest character no matter how built, strong, and fast they are. It causes races with powers to come in to save the day and steal the spotlight away from the races with no powers. You wanna know why people would want to make a character with no powers in a mostly heavy fighting rp? \n\n\n\nCan you guess?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you! Drumroll, please...\n\n\n\n\nUNDERDOG CHARACTER ARCS!!! Except that instead of one person doing it, +12 other people are doing it. Oh boy, get ready to see their OCS making 6 paged paragraphs how much they exercise and build up their speed, stamina, and strength in one day of rp time. They will detail how their punches can now instantly break mana shields and how they can kick a fireball back a people because they \u201dtrained\u201d to have resistance to fire and the strength of their kick had enough force to deflect the fireball back at the sorcerer. This sounds like an anime yet? Cause most of the time shit like this causes those anime fight scenes but it\u2019s more illogical and borderline cringe, coming from someone who watches anime. \n\nSure if your character specializes in playing dirty, being smart, using the environment to their advantage, then you sorta have a chance but still, you have to rely on things IN the rp to gain the upper hand or if the person playing the race with powers have shit writing and others find a way to exploit that. \n\nI\u2019ve seen so many fights in servers and groups because of this. It\u2019s either the non-power races complaining how powers seem to have no cooldown and people aren\u2019t showing their weaknesses or it\u2019s the people playing races with powers saying how they shouldn\u2019t be able to do XYZ because it wasn\u2019t stated in their character sheet. I do agree with this because I don\u2019t see a human with a dagger beating a witch with elemental powers. It\u2019s natural, everyone wants to feel important in the story. \n\nBecause of this, many others (including myself) have come together to make characters with no races to show the flaws in creating unbalanced races. Let\u2019s say you are in a fight with a monster that spits out acid. The only human who can shield the team from the acid coming into their bodies and melting through their skin is well... a literal medium-sized shield. Oh forgot to mention that the mod is obviously controlling said monster so you\u2019re at the mercy of them. Now you realized that your only line of defense happens to melt through metal and steel. And again I\u2019ll like to say that your characters will be at the mercy of mods because they can change the outcome of the fight. They can literally paint the \u201cmages come to save the day\u201d narrative and making the non-magic races be at awe at them. This is fine but when this happens too often you might as well just have your ocs sit back and eat popcorn while waiting for a witch to come and defeat the monster. \n\nThis problem uses stems from mods not knowing how to make things in the rp balanced and every race being on the same or similar playing field. The solution could be fixed if non-magic races could use magical items and the races with powers had a cooldown system with their skills I.e: Fireball shot 1 turn, 3 cd for it to return to be usable.\n\nTL;DR unbalanced races cause unfair advantages and it results in poor writing, overused underdog story arcs, and nonsensical fight scenes happening which cause arguments amongst members.",

Not really doing anything, just kind of sitting around hearing things go on in the ooc chat. When they were called upon, one of these players said, and I quote\n\n\"...we had a plot going on? I didn't notice.\"\n\nNow, this isn't a case of this player not knowing. I know he signed up, but wasn't chosen. Multiple people who were on the Home team signed up but weren't chosen - but like him, they seemed to have just checked out.\n\nDid we mess up somehow to make the players check out like this, or are they just sour because they weren't chosen?",

            "selftext": "This is a vent. Not really an angry one, but it's long because I just... type long winded. ~~Plus, self-isolating has probably made me crave more interactions. Who knows?~~\n\nSo, I reached out to this guy who wanted to do a spy RP. He tells me the plot he has in mind, makes a server for us, and posts his character/intro first. When I start to write *my* character, I honestly don't know too much about spies - how they become spies, what spies really do aside from what I might've seen in films, etc. - plus, I struggle some in terms of not wanting to make the background of my character too similar to his character.\n\nIt's his character. I don't want to make it seem like I lifted parts of it for my own.\n\nI went with a bit of creativity instead. The start of our characters were pretty similar. Both military kids who would then try to find themselves following in the parents' footsteps. But then I felt somewhat pressured to change things. I didn't want to make a straight line through military to government recruitment (like his). Instead, I put her into a different field, to then wind up working for the government regardless. Same general endpoint, with room for more.\n\nOnce I post, I message him OOC letting him know I didn't want to make their backgrounds too similar. *Tell me if you want me to change anything*. He said it was fine, we could fix stuff down the line. I say, cool. And we don't even have to write over things! (I assumed he was talking about retconning. Now, maybe I was wrong.) Changes to her character can go with the natural progression of the plot! You know, long-term partner plot progression. The good, rare stuff. \n\nHe says, okay. He even replies *in character*. So I'm thinking we're good. We're chill. I feel bad for not writing a spy, but she *can still become one*. We just need a little bit of room for growth. Then, when I go to reply, the server is gone. He's removed from my friends list too.\n\nAnd, like, I'm not mad. At first I kind was annoyed for sure. It felt rude to say things are fine, then suddenly delete not even 24 hours after he posted a reply. (If I were to ever ghost like that I'd... probably just not reply at all if I was thinking about deleting.) I get that it was his plot and he had an idea he wanted, but I didn't change things to intentionally disregard what he wanted nor was I unmoving in changing things to fit his idea more. I only did it because a) I thought there could be story progression - even if it only took a few posts - and b) making my character too similar to his would've seemed lazy and possibly looked even more rude.\n\nFrom a confrontation point, I get it. It's easier to avoid any conflict by just ghosting. I once stayed in a server where my partner forgot to answer me - *twice on the same post*! After two months she realized I was the only person in her shared server she hadn't replied to. Then still didn't reply. - for three months because I was afraid of her asking me why I left. (Which she did, after month four.) I just wish that he either told me my OC wasn't really what he wanted rather than deleting suddenly.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I would take criticism on a character - especially if there's a vision in mind - a lot easier than zero communication. Because if *you* know how to write a certain character, you can feed in helpful input rather than scrapping the whole thing entirely. Or compromise. Generally speaking, not just in terms of this whole scenario, I don't think you'll ever find a RP partner who will 100% match your vision unless you write the entire plot together. Even with friends or co-writers you still might have conflicting images that you wind up having to adjust.\n\nTLDR; Partner wants us to write a spy vs spy plot but I didn't know how to design my character without her being too much like his. I tweak some stuff, we talk about possibly changing things in the future, *he replies IC*, deletes the server before I can reply, and unfriends me so I can't reach out.",

            "selftext": "\n\nLet me first say I wish no ill on these people. The only thing I wish is...never to have met them in the first place. They ruined writing for me, triggering my anxiety and depression and making me feel worthless. No one should have to feel like that, yet the group all decide who's worth writing with and who isn't by badmouthing them, playing the victim card, and mocking them behind their back. I have seen it firsthand, and never approved of it. It was one of the many reasons I stayed silent in the group. Perhaps that was my fault. I should've said something, but I was afraid I would be the next target for them. I should've been stronger. But now? I don't care. This is just me venting and releasing everything so I can finally move on. \n\nAlso, these people were part of the toxic site Roleplay.me, so if you're looking for a fun place to write... Don't go there. EVER. \n\nThere was one person (let's call her Bianca) who would always make herself the victim. They would always have a \"poor me\" attitude and compare their character to other duplicate ones. They seeked for attention in negative ways which wasn't cool, especially when she started verbally complaining about how other people would write with MY character and not hers. It would make me feel terrible about having this character in the first place, and I would always NEVER write as that character so Bianca could write. Needless to say, the story always died, and it wasn't my fault. \n\n Another person (let's call him Dick) was the secret smut seeker. He would act like he writes amazing plots and details (which... UGH, he was a good writer I have to confess), but it's just to hide the fact that all his stories had smut. He would have his character call others \"dirty filthy whores\" and do the absolute worst, darkest things to them. Would wrote about his manlyhood throbbing and veins popping out and... You get the idea. \n\nDick was the ringleader of the whole group. Everyone flocked to him, craved his attention, wanted to write with him, plot story ideas... Everything. He acted as friend and confidente but whenever someone pointed out something wrong he did, he shifted the blame to others. It wasn't HIS fault he wrote multiple sex scenes with random behind people's back--after stating he was only shipping characters with one person--oh no, it was because of people like (here he would ramble about other male writers on the site for writing smut or always checking out other profiles but not responding. The only reason Dick never got caught was because he turned off his stalker notification.)\n\nMy characters were running dry on motivation. They were collecting dust, and I didn't want to have accounts collecting dust. So I properly notified people I was writing with, giving them notice that I was deleting my inactive  characters. Apparently, that wasn't good enough and I got my ear chewed off on how selfish that was of me. \n\nSorry if I wanted to move on since nothing was happening with my characters. \n\nSomeone close to me (let's call her Pam) gave me props for it, though. She and I were vistims of Dick's toxic ways and she told me how proud she was of me and she wished she had the strength to do that. He hurt her more than anyone else with his lies and bullshit. Eventually, she finally did after she hacked into his account and discovered all his smut stories he was writing and things he would say and do that didn't match what he told her. \n\nFast forward to a month or so later. She goes back to him. WHY?! after all he did?! It was all I could think about, I was so angry. So I did something I regret even doing in the first place. \n\nI created a fake account. He added my character the first fucking day and I accepted. Pretended to be someone else. Got the evidence I needed, though. He never changed. He still talked the same way to everyone the way he did, he... Heh, he even took credit for finding a website that made background collages... THAT I ORIGINALLY SHOWED HIM. he made my account promise not to say anything or show it to anyone. (for the record, it's befunky.com and it's an awesome site where you can make background images or cover photos if you chose to.) I showed him this site when we used to talk, and he steals the credit. How fucking rude. \n\nEventually he found out through a hacker friend (let's call her Mole) that it was indeed me, and I deleted everything. I got all the answers that I needed. However, it cost me my friendship with Pam. Because Dick went crawling to her to inform her what had happened. \n\nFun fact for all this though... I didn't know it was Mole who told him. Because she was also a close friend of mine. She stated she was getting back online and done writing with Dick and had created a couple Marvel and DC characters and wanted to know if I was coming back. So, I give it another go and tell her my account names. \n\nMole tells Dick EVERYTHING. I didn't realize it until being confronted by Pam and noticing Mole had blocked and removed me from discord, the site... Everything. \n\nIt was my own stupid fault, I know. But now, I wonder...did I really lose? Because they all went back to Dick. After we all banded together and told eachother everything he would say to us in private. Shared screenshots. Confided in eachother and revealed how much of a toxic asshole he is. \n\nI left. They went back. It is what it is. If they trash talk me, let them. I don't have to deal with him anymore. I don't have to deal with Bianca and her guilt trips and victim cards. 'Oh no one will write with me, they all wanna write with mysterion.'  - - - 'Oh, I wanna wrote as MY character, but you all obviously want mysterion to do it, so I'll just be left out' - - - 'why do they like writing with you more than me?! Waaaahhh' \n\nOr me trying to seek Pam's approval because people adore her and follow her. Or me trying to please Dick so he won't have another scolding speech towards me and my choices. \n\nI'm free of it all. I wish things ended differently, I wish I never thought of the idea of creating a fake account, and for that, I take full blame for and apologize if they ever find this, read it, and discover it's about them. I just wish the toxic hypocrisy would end. I know it never will, but...\n\nI...I wish them well. I do. I hope they come to their senses and change their ways. I hope they find peace in the choices they have made, like I am. I can't change the past, but I won't let it affect my future anymore.",

            "selftext": "...which is what made it so bad. So a little premise before I continue. This woman found my contact information via some third party roleplaying website. She contacted me, feeling that I would be a good fit for the world that she and her friend, G, were creating.\n\nThis was my first time being contacted by someone who was so detailed and specific with their request. E was the first person to contact me regarding joining this very specific RP, a very detail oriented RP from the sounds of it. Naturally I asked for more information about the premise of this RP, how many active members she had, how the RP was run (were there several smaller RPs in this overarching world or was the RP itself a cohesive story, kinda like DnD), average post length, the general themes and motifs they were looking for, etc etc.\n\nAt first I was quite impressed. They'd not set up a Google Doc like I thought they would. No, these two had gone through the trouble of setting up a forum. They had an intro page that had a rather catchy pull into their story (a team of ragtag people with powers are hunted by some evil corporation that sees people with powers as evil. These individuals initially have trouble working together but are meant to finally come together to defeat this evil corporation).\n\nIt. Was. An. Absolute. Shitshow. This is before the Avengers movie came out so I can't even compare it to that but...they were essentially trying to show that each member of this RP team had a chip on their shoulder, or some sort of character flaw that kept them from working well with others. I didn't mind this too much, but then I was introduced to one character who's flaw AND power (?) was that she is required by some sort of binding magical curse to kill anyone who lies. We'll call her G1 (numbered because it gets a bit complex).\n\nSo...My character, J, G1, G2, and E1 are in an elevator. E1's character flaw is apparently drinking and was thinking about lying about it to E2. G1, pulls out her katana and she. Goes. OFF. G2 hasn't batted an eye during all this. Meanwhile J is literally having heart palpitations over here and G2 simply goes \"you'll get used to it.\" I'm sorry, WHAT?\n\nNow, I was willing to write this off and just keep my character's away from G's, but they ridiculousness of G1 going around killing people was just absolutely stupid, as she had killed a few more random NPCs already. I confronted the owner of these characters about it, first confirming that G1's whole thing is that she HAS to kill. Not, maim or injure, nor attempt to kill or anything but....has to deliver a death blow. I received a very emphatic affirmative, followed by a lengthy and completely ignored explanation.\n\nI then proceeded to outline the following scenario. Let's say I create a second character, J2. Now, J1 is talking to G1 and chooses to lie about something that is integral to her character development. You're telling me that G1 is going to kill J1, who does not have any sort of healing ability, because she lied? You're just going to off my character without my permission? And to build on that, let's say J2 is 8 years old, is brand new to this encampment, and has just witnessed G1 killing J1 for a lie. A logical statement for G1 to make may be something along the lines of \"You're new here, who are you?\" And J2, understandably, lies about her name because she doesn't want this psycho to kill her in her sleep. You're telling me J2 is going to kill this little 8 year old child for lying, something that ALL children do?\n\nThe second I received backtracking instead of simply owning up to the stupidity of the character, I decided to get out of this RP. J packed up her things and left during the night, leaving a letter suggesting that the other characters play some sort of team sport to try and work together. I went back to that site about a year and a half later. Turns out the character's took J's idea up and decided to play baseball.\n\nYou remember what I said about too much detail? The next three pages of this forum were them deciding positions, flexing on whatever position they were in, and one of the posts was literally \"He pitched the ball.\" That's it. Four effing words.\n\nI must have purged it from my mind because I cannot, for the life of me, find this forum again. Perhaps they deleted it too? I sincerely hope so.",

            "selftext": "So I've been friends with someone whom I roleplay with for almost a year now. He's great, he's amazing, we click really well and through our stories we have developed a great friendship. We used to write pretty much everyday until he came back from a two month break a few weeks ago. We have a new story going on and everything, but we barely have time to talk anymore. Sometimes we'll go five days without talking to each other, and it's just... Kinda upsetting? I know five days may not seem like a lot to others, but I have an issue with staying in focus and not growing out of a rp if too much time goes by without having contact with my partner or receiving a constant flow of posts. \n\nI asked him about it and told him that I'd prefer if he told me if he didn't have time to rp anymore, as I'd prefer to focus on just one active RP instead of having a few slow paced ones. He'd reply with 'I'm here now' constantly, which I guess is fine. Later I asked if we could exchange schedules so we could be online at the same time, and despite planning it, he never comes on during the time he said he would. I do see him online, and sometimes I'll leave a small message saying hi just to check if he's there, and he'll reply but also be away. When I don't message him, he won't. Sometimes I'll ask him if he'll be online tomorrow or any other day, and he'll say yeah, and then he won't be. \n\nI'm just so confused? He is excited about the rp and I know he is, as when we did spend time together to talk he would be hyped about it, but these false promises are just... So disheartening. I care for him a lot and I don't wanna abruptly stop our rp or anything like that, but at the same time I wish we could have more time together.\n\nAm I overreacting? Do I perhaps care too much about this?",

Infact that's the place I used to RP. Then moved to Kik. \n\nIt was kik where my roleplaying improved, became Literate and I realized how fun group Roleplaying is. Eventually moved to other platforms. On kik I realized how much of a hassle it is to Roleplay. Every guy simply wants to pair with another female Character and hook up. Nothing Wrong with it if they both want it right? But I soon realize almost all groups Role-plays are just Roleplays between couples, their Characters just often crossover with each other sometimes for plots. \n\nIn one instance one guy was angry because I introduced my Character through her female love Interest Character. Wasn't even trying to hit on her but merely say Hi simply because I knew the Roleplayer well and she agreed to introduce my Character to the Role-play. The guy later said he planned it all out, Don't meddle in our Roleplay. Well if you wanna just Roleplay between you two then why even do it in a frigging group? Ofcourse I can't generalize all group rpers like this. Some do get along and rp is great. But essentially it's just everyone trying to pair their Characters with someone else and if you are in a Roleplay where you have no one to pair with then find Someone and then bring her to the group for yourself.\n\nGroup Roleplays are a hassle and the frigging drama between people could ruin your RP. Since then I rp 1x1. \n\n1x1 rp can go wrong too but it's salvageable &amp; manageable if you just talk it out between the two. Group Roleplays often when they go wrong are just not redeemable.\n\nI know many of you love group RPs. Totally understandable I am not saying you shouldn't but for me it's not something I would do. I have been in several group Roleplays and almost all of them have the same pattern or end up doing the same.",

All of his characters are meant to be hard to get, but it just comes off as bitch and is not fun to play with. He also doesn\u2019t allow for much response in his actions, he says something and my character is forced to do it, and I have to go along with it.\n\nSorry if this sounds nit picky, but this roleplay has some fun characters in it, but has just become less fun to play because of the people involved.",

            "selftext": "I haven't posted in this subreddit yet but I do check it frequently, I guess because I'm curious what horror stories folks have encountered in their roleplay journeys. I've been fairly fortunate, overall, but I did have this situation crop up recently that made me want to write a post here.\n\nSo, I found a partner who wanted to play out a plot involving a vampire pirate, and since that sounded kinda fun, I agreed to take on that role. We did some mild brainstorming beforehand, but mostly just jumped right in, with her character having stowed away on my character's ship and his crew discovers her, yadda yadda. Given that he's a vampire AND a pirate, he's probably supposed to be somewhat dastardly, so I have him toy with her a bit, and then all of a sudden she introduces the fact that her character has been horribly sexually and physically abused in the past, to the fact where she's got cuts &amp; burns all over her body and is basically traumatized (and, up until that point, she'd made her character feisty and stubborn and quick to challenge &amp; back-talk my guy, which isn't to say that folks can't react in different ways, but it just struck me as inconsistent).\n\nSuddenly it's difficult for me to play out this dastardly vampire-pirate dude who's supposed to do wicked things to her, because I-as-a-player (whose job involves working with sexual assault survivors) am just NOT down with that. I kiiiiiinda wish that had come up before. Anyway, we ended up talking about it, and she offered to retcon the horrible abuse aspect, but as if it were no biggie. Like, wouldn't that be a major aspect of her character and shape her as an individual? I think that's the part that bugged me the most -- that it seemed as if the traumatizing abuse were just something she decided to  throw in to make things interesting, without actually considering how that would shape or define her character.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it though. It was just some random RP we started and didn't delve too deep into backstories or motivations for our characters -- we were just kinda making things up on the fly. But I still feel like one should try and create a well-crafted, consistent character where, if you're going to introduce a major back-story like that, it should fit with everything else. And if you decide to remove it, that's also going to change who your character is and how they behave.\n\nBasically, when it comes to trauma and abuse, don't just \"throw it in\" for shits and giggles. And maybe give your partner a heads up before you do. \n\nAnyone else encounter anything like this?",

            "selftext": "If there is a better flair for Discord rp I apologize, I didn't see one. On to the story.\n\nI decided to join an open Discord RP, as I prefer the quick back and forth available on chat RPs and can type up paragraph pretty easily. RPers on discord often seem to be paragraph or two long so I can adjust quite easily to that, and it really isn't too hard. Now the owner, unfortunately, did not have the best judgement- she was often quite obnoxious, but this isn't about her as much as her friend she dragged into it. He, whom we will call Shadow from now on, was quite edgy- in the \"I have no reason but now desire to assault small animals just because I don't like the other characters enjoying themselves\" way. In RP however, we would often easily drive him away as it's like 3 to 4 magic users against just 1.\n \nShadow's replies were always one line, but we accepted it as life because otherwise things were going fine. Until he wrote something outright impossible because of the placement of our characters- stating he assaulted them when they had been long gone elsewhere. Of course we asked Shadow how he did that- politely, as everybody makes mistakes- only for Shadow to respond with \"It's not my fault you guys are damn novelists. I can't read all that.\" Soon after, the server died in general due to things like this from Shadow and the owner who refused to do anything but complain, and I haven't seen Shadow around since. But I do still wonder how maybe 9 paragraphs (assuming we all write quite a bit for the situation) is \"too much reading\" if you joined rp knowing it's a hobby of about 90% reading others paragraphs in group rps?",

I have no idea why it comes over me even when I really love the idea. So I\u2019ve stopped trying to approach 1x1 RP\u2019s because the feeling of getting left after like a week is shitty. \n\nTaking a break hasn\u2019t worked, I just come on with excitement that dies after a week once again. I usually have this problem with 1x1 RPs which I\u2019ve always wanted to do, but I cannot for the life of me stay motivated to reply. Even if I love the story and everything, it\u2019s draining and making me guilt riddled. I wish I could find a fix so I could enjoy it more. Does anyone else have a similar problem?

Since then I've had quite a few partners want to do it and it starts off well enough but after the first smut scene they ghost me. I don't know what it is but all of a sudden they stop responding to messages without so much as a hint of being dissatisfied with the rp. \n\nIt's really frustrating when you put so much effort in and actually want to discuss ideas for the story (I wrote the prompt so that just about whatever my partner was into fetish wise it could be included, with the idea being that we would work together to decide where the story went) but once they get their rocks off once or twice their out. \n\nRemember everyone that girls just want to get off just like guys and they'll go along with whatever until they've gotten what they want, just like guys. \n\nThat said I'm not going to just show my side but also look for some insight. In my prompt I state that I want to include a harem (IT ACTUALLY PLAYS INTO THE STORY), wish fulfillment? Maybe but isnt that what all roleplay is more or less? \n\nAnyways I do all the set up, discuss it and look for their input but they never seem to want to contribute anything meaningful.\n\nNow that I've finished my rant/vent if anyone would like to give advice or if you're curious about the prompt send me a message.

So I was just trying ny luck again, maybe the next partner I find is the best one yet.\n\nSo I was doing what I usually do, saying hello and waiting for them to respond, or if I was feeling lazy I would just copy paste my age and gender and see if they disconnect or not. But this time, I didn't get the usual response of their age and gender or just the outright disconnect, instead what I got was somewhere along the lines of this:\n\n\"Asl doesn't matter in rp, you only ask for it if you're a c*ck desperate for c**chie\"\n\nNow that bothered me a bit and got me wondering; is it wrong to want to rp with someone of the opposite gender? See the kind of roles I like are romantic in nature, and since I'm straight I'm atteacted to the opposite sex. Is it wrong for me to want to rp with someone who's a woman roleplaying as a woman? I know that there's no absolute way of making sure the people I'm roleplaying with are actually women, but atleast I have the illusion of it, is that so bad?",
