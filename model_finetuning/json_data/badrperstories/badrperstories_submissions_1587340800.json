            "selftext": "Hello all, \n\n  \nI have been sitting on this story for a while but I feel like I need to tell you all the story of the Hostage Character or the most Mary Sue  character I have ever seen.  \n\n\nFirst, I believe some background is needed. Once upon a time, I was the admin for a Percy Jackson roleplay discord server. The idea was that there were OC children of the gods and some of the kids were really powerful but they had to earn this power.  This server had a few main roleplay tenets they had.   \n\n\n1.  Put in the effort for the character. Character sheets were usually pretty long.\n2. 50 words per post. Oddly enough this rule was a sticking point.\n3. The more powerful the parent, the longer the backstory must be. Children of Gods are already powerful so you need to earn that power.  For example, I had a child of Zeus who could lift 750 pounds over his head at the start. This was allowed because my backstory alone was five pages long double spaced and it was the myth of Persues in a modern setting. I put the effort into it. For reference, the most powerful kids were what the lore called \"The Big Three\" kids. \n\nWhen I joined the server, I was the only one to have a child of Zeus. My character was strong but he also had weaknesses and a backstory that explained why he could do what he did. In this server, the owner and his second in command had been fighting about just about everything they could think of. This story is about the Owner btw and I will call them the Owner for now.  \n\n\nSo I posted my six-pages long character sheet and was instantly accepted. Things were going fine as the Owner and his staff fought over anything and everything. Eventually, I was made into a staff member because I tried to get them to stop. It was then that the Owner snapped. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething about me being a staff member made the Owner mad and he demanded that he wanted a Big Three kid now and that my character (that he had accepted before ) had to be removed. We all stopped him with that last part but since we couldn't tell anyone no in terms of character creation, he was allowed to put a sheet up for the other staff to approve.   \n\n\nA few things to explain before I show what I remember of the character. The Owner (who was male) had serious issues with men to the point where he would demonize them in his writing. He would creep on female characters and players on the server. Finally, his characters were always the \"Beloved\" (ie most powerful) of their parents (the Gods). Best I could tell, no one had ever told him no.  Please note that I saved a few choice quotes that stuck with me.  \n\n\nHere are a few of the \"highlights\" from the character and the reason for them:  \n\n\n* The Character was 17 and an air force veteran. The reason for this was because my character's mother had been a pilot and the Owner wanted to \"Have a stronger character\". \n* The Character was an orphan raised in some sort of nightmarish Dickensian esque Orphanage with a  \" mean old hag named sister Bertha \" nicknamed Big Bertha. No, I did not add that nickname.\n* The Character had a boyfriend who \" he has been born with AIDS \". Yes, a sensitive subject like that was just thrown out there. Said boyfriend was killed by The Character and quickly forgotten about.\n* The Character escaped the nightmare orphanage, got a perfect fake id, and was able to join the Air Force.   She was kicked out but that didn't stop her from moving on!\n* The Character started dating another guy who was super like the first dead one. It was at this point that the character gained her superpowers (Godly powers). The Boyfriend would say  \"am I dating Super girl?\" regularly.\n* Her powers were just the strongest! She could do everything without training and was the Beloved of her Father! *Her father (Zeus) had told her that he hated her brother Logan (my character).*   This was in the sheet and around the point my Mary Sue Alarms started blaring. \n* Eventually, she was so powerful that she vaporized the new Boyfriend when evil Nightmare Nun Bertha came back! So that's two meaningless characters dead for no reason.\n* She arrived at the camp (the game's setting) with a copy of her autobiography under her arm. \n\nObviously, I took one read of the sheet and politely told him that the character was too powerful, knew a lot about the setting (which was not allowed), and finally, he could not demonize MY CHARACTER in his writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat really set him off. The owner said he would delete the entire server unless The Character was accepted! He claimed that I hated him and wanted to ruin him! So he would delete everything right now unless I accepted his character! He went so far as to try and removing everyone's posting privileges. Sadly, Staff were always able to talk and we managed to talk him down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This went on for a few hours before finally, he stopped and dropped it.  \n\n\n  \nTLDR: A Staff member makes a Mary Sue, gets politely called out for it, flips out and holds the server hostage.",

            "selftext": "Okay let me start off by saying i love this friend to bits (let's call him C), but my god, he is so painfully bad at roleplay.\n\n  \nIt's just his characters that are the problem, to be fair, his plot devices ... could use some work, but they're at least imaginative.\n\n  \nBut the characters. Dear god. It's the same cookie-cutter depressed uwu helpless baby every. goddamn. time. They're constantly getting hurt for,,, no reason. Everyone hates his characters without reason, he'll go out and get jumped in the street by complete strangers. My characters (who I usually start out very excited to play) become complete caregivers for his characters, and then his characters will suddenly show uncharacteristic displays of badassery at random moments and be like 'oh, i don't need protecting'\n\n  \nHere's one example: my character, the leader of a notorious gang, got captured and tortured by a rival gang, and by the time he finally managed to escape he was half dead and barely knew what was going on, and so he ended up in hospital, despite hating it.   \nWhile visiting my character in the hospital, C's character gets tortured. By doctors. Ordinary doctors who just happen to work at this hospital and hate his character for no reason. And then my character doesn't even get to recover, he just has to protect C's character. Things like this happen all the time.\n\n  \nHe also turns everything into sex scene after sex scene, and I went along with it when it started because it was fun and silly, but it got to the point where as soon as the characters had sex the rp was over, and they would do nothing else. So I banned sex in rp completely and *somehow* it still happens. I insist on fading to black but its just boring and it wastes time and I hate it. \n\nI just don't know how to talk to him about it without horribly offending him, especially since he just got out of a horribly toxic relationship in which his partner constantly insulted his writing, and I have no problem with his writing style or anything at all, I'm just a firm believer that rp should be fun for everyone, and I just dread replying to him at this point. Does anyone have any advice about how to broach the topic? I would much rather just put up with terrible rp until the end of time than lose his friendship, but ideally we can sort things out.\n\nTL;DR: Friend makes the most horrible characters which all get tortured for no reason (and thats the whole plot), I don't know how to nicely ask him to stop doing that.",

As boring as it sounds, I would rather have,\"Oh no, I forgot to turn in my library book!\" In comparison to \"I have a rare flesh-eating disease and I'm afraid to tell my family because then my wife will take the kids\"\n\nI like slice of life things. Occasional mythical being fitting into normal society, American Dragon style.\n\nSo because of all of this, I like to state very clearly at the beginning of all of my rps that I am not okay with any type of abuse (animal abuse, drug abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, neglect etc.) And self harm.\n\nCall me crazy, but I think that people can have a slice of life rp without those things.\n\nSo I have this partner. And they're great, other than this tiny thing... they will repeatedly write responses with abuse and then afterwards (directly after they send the response) ask me if it's okay. I always say no.\n\nIt got to the point where I sort of had to politely say,\"Uh yeah, but it's just kinda that I said no abuse at the beginning and all so..\" and they toned it down a lot. Although they did mention that they liked to \"show not tell\" and I'm pretty sure they didn't mean it as a jab towards me to imply that I didnt know the basics of writing, but you know.\n\nIn the rp that we're doing now it's like we can't have a single soft moment because their character will always have an internal monologue about how messed up they are. I very often feel like my character goes ignored in favor of their own character. In fact it's kinda hard to get my character alone with theirs because they're playing other characters and seem to just want to write fanfiction between the side characters.\n\nThe main story was supposed to be that my character didn't believe in the concept of love and their character was supposed to try and convince mine. Their character always says that they are obsessed with mine but they dont show it at all. (Show don't tell much?) They are always off sulking somewhere or busy with something else.\n\nI just needed to vent, honestly. This partner is great other than making it a heavier rp than I would like. I've told them I wanted it to be lighter, and in fairness it is. I guess I should've said that I just wanted it to be light.",

He's basically a high-functioning sociopath, an ex-con with a mild case of antisocial personality disorder. Other than that, he's mostly fun to interact with, a trickster type character that some of my partners actually like because of his sense of humor.\n\nSo yeah it's not like he's a moustache-twirling villain that you can see from a mile away, BUT he is still obviously a bad person and some people tend to underestimate that due to his sense of humor.\n\nSo if you were a partner to this character, which one would you prefer in terms of RPing experience?\n\n1. If I kept you informed at all times when my character's lying or trying to manipulate your character (for example explicitly saying or implying it in the monologue)?\n2. Or if I just keep it up for interpretation so you can guess, but also possibly set your character up for a disappointment if you miss the signs?\n\nThanks for the advice!",

Like seriously I wish there were more sites that used the base concept, it's just SO elegant, but there's not much to pick through if you're not looking for fandom RP\n\nBUT that's not what I'm here about! I popped onto that website about 6 weeks ago, having used its predecessor Trollplay a few times way back during the freaking Homestuck renaissance. If you're not familiar with the format, basically  the main page is full of prompts (with a few bare-bones filters) posted by anonymous users. It'll describe the premise of the RP and sometimes have a starter, and you can connect to any of them and just start RPing, usually having a bit of OOC discussion beforehand but not necessarily always required.\n\nThere's also a directory for more in-depth searching/posting, with tag searches etc. But a main-page prompt usually means the poster is online and will respond quickly.\n\nSO within minutes of joining I see exactly one starter that's all my yes, and connect to the prompt. I pitch them a character, they seem super into it. They pitch me a character, I'm definitely super into it. We actually spend a couple days going back and forth hashing out the details of our characters and how the RP will go down. I was super excited about it and they seemed to be, too.\n\nThen I went ahead and wrote them a nice chunky \\~500 word starter, which they told me was awesome and that they were writing their response right away\n\nAaand that was over a month ago. I have nudged them twice since then, just \"hey are you still interested?\" after three days of no response, and \"is there anything I can change to make this prompt/character work for you, because I was really excited for this RP\" after 22 days of no response. Both times got the \"oh there's just so much going on and  I've been so stressed, I'm definitely still excited/interested in this RP!\"\n\nWhich like, would totally be fine with me. Everything is crazygonuts right now, I myself have spent more of this quarantine than I'd like to admit just burrowed under my blankets and dead to the world. \n\nExcept they are constantly relisting the prompt both on the main page and in the directory, occasionally rewording it slightly so they can repost it multiple times, so they are obviously still frantically searching for someone for this RP idea.\n\nObviously they're not interested in RPing with me and are never going to respond, it just hurts after spending so much time planning it out, thinking we were both excited about it, and even offering to change my character/starter into something they'd like better, to just be freakin bailed on without even one response.",

            "selftext": "So I've recently gotten back into RPing in fantasy settings after years of steadfastly avoiding them, and am quickly remembering why I kinda stopped. I really love fantasy world-building, and insist on doing a lot of it because eeeeeh so much of the bargain-basement standard-issue collection of high fantasy tropes is either vaguely or overtly problematic and I just do not prefer to fucks with it. SO that's the first hurdle. The second hurdle is that folks out there who *do* try to dabble in some worldbuilding and just, wildly miss the mark.\n\nThis isn't about any person or forum in particular, just the frustrations I've personally had trying to play in this space. \n\nThe first is the setting just being, super nebulous. Even trying to pin down a general time period to base the state of technology, art, and architecture in the world can be so frustrating. \"So what time period did you have in mind for this setting?\" is often answered with \"just regular medieval fantasy\" which like. \"Medieval\" refers to a 1000 year span of history. 1000 years of technology and fashion and social norms, in *one* part of the world!\n\nThat's not even touching on the fact that people tend to use \"medieval\" to mean everything from \"possibly the actual middle ages\" to \"idk Victorian,\" and actually usually mean \"Renaissance\" (also when they say \"Victorian\" they usually mean \"Regency\" if the don't mean \"Steampunk...\"). Not that Western Europe is the default template by which all civilizations would develop (and ooooh I could make a whole nother salty post about that) but like. Is there indoor plumbing? What does the average person who's not a protagonist wear? What kind of jobs are there? What does family life look like? These can all drastically change within a few generations!\n\nWhich is another thing that frustrates me with fantasy settings, that so many of them stay exactly the same for thousands of years. The thought that technology would develop to ~~\"renaissance\"~~ \"medieval\" and then just... stop... is honestly pretty freakin dystopian. Especially considering that there would be magic to more quickly solve problems of energy faster than we managed it in the real world.\n\nThe unrealistic cultural stagnation clashes hard with the tendency of people to make their fantasy characters too \"modern,\" or at least to not do any cursory research into what a person in this sort of world might actually be like. I mean, I personally think having slightly more modern dialogue or attitudes can suit the writing, I think Tolkien-esque type dialogue is pretty bland and dry, but there's... idk there's kind of a balance, kind of a difference in when it's done on purpose and done because the writer doesn't really know how to give their characters a unique voice that feels like it fits in the world, and just has their character speak the same way they do.\n\nAnother place where... not really considering how the world would actually work is apparel. Which comes up hilariously often when you like to write smutty stuff like yours truly. I mean, I have a slight obsession with fashion and re: historical fashion I love watching stuff like priorattire and really getting INTO historical apparel, so it's just kinda funny to me when someone writing a fancy princess or whatever has her just shuck off her court gown like it's a cotton maxi dress. Like nah girl there's a lot of bodice to rip there. Then the kirtle. Then the stomacher. Then the stays. Then the chemise...\n\nLike, again, fantasy world wouldn't necessarily have the exact same fashions as a particular period in western history, BUT seriously consider what people are wearing and how it's influenced by the world they live in. Handmade, natural fabrics tend to be pretty breathable, so you layer a lot of them for aesthetics or just to freaking keep warm.  You probably want to keep your tiddies in check for comfort at the very least -- that's what corsets were for, after all, they weren't torture devices. There's probably not a coin wash around, so you're gonna want to wear fullbody undergarments to keep your stank from reaching your actual clothes. How often are you bathing, anyway? We got indoor plumbing???\n\nOn the flip side of this, you've got the \"well ACtuALLY\" crowd who insist that all life before the modern era was the plague-stricken dark ages in London, that everything was overcrowded, everyone was filthy, people died at age 35, everyone was raping everyone constantly, and black/brown people didn't exist unless it was to live a tortured life of slavery and exploitation. \n\nAND THEN there are the handful of people who want fantasy to basically be historical fiction, painstakingly accurate renditions of a very specific place and time in real history. Which, *to me*, just... isn't fun?\n\nThis is a vent but idk I'd love you nerds' input on the topic. Do you struggle with finding that comfy place in the venn diagram between accuracy, believability, and fun? What are your pet peeves with clumsy spec fic? Give me all the dirty details.\n\nPS just an example of something I consider to be a perfect fantasy world: the Avatar series. A very concretely-built world with consistent rules and cultural/historical influences that were identifiable but still presented in a unique way. Unique and identifiable cultures that cleanly carried the elemental theme without being one-dimensional or racist tropes. Believable development of technology within one human generation, and said technology actually impacting the world. Acknowledgement that if there is a social rift between magic-users and mundanes, the magic-users will almost definitely be in the privileged position (i.e. oppression of magic users is a shitty allegory for actual oppression). Characters that feel like they belong in their setting, but manage to do so while having modern dialogue and attitudes and problems that make them relatable. Baller soundtrack.",

            "selftext": "If you haven't cringed at the title then I applaud you for you, sir or madam, have a greater contitution than I.\n\nSo today we learn about Ayuna and Setsune, two characters that were designed for a Lord of the Rings roleplay! (Not the characterss real names as I'm not sure if posting the characters' real names goes against rule 1. However, the anime-esque nature of the names has hopefully been portrayed). \n\nPicture if you well, tiny chubby little ol' me. I've just finished finals, I've settled in with dinner and for the past two weeks, I have binge watched all the Hobbit movies and the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings movies. I'm listening to Merry singing whilst I write scenes out for a fanfic, I'm listening to covers of LotR music...\n\nIt is painfully clear that I. Am. In. A. MOOD.\n\nSo I make a post. Now unlike some of my more obscure fandoms that I crave, I figured LotR would have quite a few eager writers, yes? Yes, I was correct! One contacts me to write, states that she's got an entire story loosely plotted out, and that she's got not one, but TWO characters that she wants to play as. Better yet, she's willing to not only play as both of her OCs at once, she's also willing to play as a third and fourth Canon character! What?!\n\nWell slap me with a tire and fill 'er up with air cuz I am PUMPED. Up till then, I'd never encountered another person who felt comfortable writing as more than two characters. I myself can handle six characters at a time with ease and if I feel that we have good writing chemistry, I'll happily push myself to my soft limit of seven and my hard limit of nine. Finding another person who could write as even four characters was mind-blowing to me. I assumed that, anyone who could write as four individuals in their RP posts was surely adept at character development. I mean they'd have to be, right? How else would one be able to tell the difference? A rule I always use when playing multiple OCs is to take out the excess writing and leave just the dialogue in. If the conversation can be easily followed along without relying on vernacular (ex. how J.K Rowling writes Hagrid's speech), then the character's voices make sense. I assumed she followed this same rule so I agreed to RP. And...technically, I was right. Her characters DID have vastly different voices. \n\nSo the premise of the story was that after the Ring had been destroyed, a new evil awakened. Smaug's father (or brother?) had awoken and was significantly more powerful, more evil, more magical, etc etc. Gandalf decided to get a new reptile extermination gang together (because fighting ONE dragon clearly wasn't traumatic enough for poor Bilbo, who's roleplaying was in my hands). In my first post, and the intro to this RP, Gandalf (also me) had ventured out and sent messages to five others (three canons and two of my OCs) to meet at Rivendell and was heading out to get Bilbo, who had been returned again at his youthful age. I did what I usually do; established that the world was at peace, established the growing unrest and how it affected the world, the sudden event that caused our team to form and finally a short two or three paragraphs detailing what's going on right this second to give my partner space to respond. \n\nMy partner replies by introducing her first character, a world famous bounty hunter. She's apparently so famous and so feared that even lawbreakers and hooligans instantly submit at the mention of her.  She is...a ditzy blonde. And not just ditzy. She's like, one of \\*those\\* kind's, y'know? Like, the ones that, like, turn up the valley girl accent and, like...I can't continue that anymore. But you get the idea. She's an airhead. She doesn't get even the most basic of jokes, she doesn't know how to track (A bounty hunter that can't track?), she doesn't know how to read a goddamn compass. \n\nThis OC finds her OTHER OC. This second OC is apparently a frighteningly powerful witch. She's so powerful that even Thranduil, Galadriel, Saruman, and Elrond, the four BIG names, are \"visibly\" cowed by her because they can sense her power. This second OC is...you guessed it, a broody, moody, emo preteen. Oh and apparently she, and only she, can speak to dragons. Oh and, Smaug didn't die because of anything that happened AT the Lonely Mountain, oh no. No, he died because she willed it to be so from her mother and father's kingdom in bumfucknowhereia. \n\nThat was it. I couldn't do it anymore. It was quite a few cliches that wiped my interest: \n\n1. I honestly can't stand this whole \"extremely powerful character hidden away\" trope. It's overused, at least in my experience, and is almost never used well. \n2. I've been noticing lately that a lot of poor roleplayers that play in an anime fandom tend to follow this pattern of \"the younger and more childish my character looks/acts, the more powerful they actually are.\" \n3. Don't break the basic logic of the world. You can't have a bounty hunter who doesn't know how to do BASIC things. You wouldn't make an FBI field agent character who doesn't know how to shoot a gun or a gladiator fighter who doesn't know how to wield a blade. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long rant. If your screens have fogged up from all my venting, I apologize.",

            "selftext": "So this is probably the most controversial thing I will ever say on the internet. \n\nLet me start off by saying this: I have struggled with self harm ever since the fifth grade with occasional relapses (A year and 2 months clean now) so I know what it's like. I know the mindset, I get it.\n\nSo I was on a roulette website since my usual rp website banned my fandom from rping there. The reason that is, is a whole other thing.\n\nSo with roulette websites you'll put a word that kinda goes with your story in your name. Whether that be 'Big dick!' or 'Plumber!' or 'Abused!' It could range from anything, really. Then, if someone is interested in that, then you either send a starter or talk about the plot, or extremists will just straight up go into script rp.\n\nSo I was doing this with a character from a fandom that isnt usually seen as toxic. It even labels itself as the most accepting fandom or whatever. (Recently this self proclamation has changed). And there's this person that keeps on saying stuff to be in the fandom and then just leaving. They didnt even hear my idea from my word, they just assumed what it meant.\n\nThe word was 'Broken' because my character is the embodiment of a heart. They insist that I'm killing the series (?) and just generally insulting me. I try to explain to them that 'bro it's not that serious' but they never stick around long enough for me to even ttpe anything.\n\nSo I got really pissed. Usually I keep a level head, but all I wanted to do was rp in the fandom and it was extremely hard to do it without the other website I was talking about. \n\nThis other person was the only other person on the roulette site in my fandoms tag so we were automatically paired over and over. So I typed a message that I could immediately send without having to worry about time and then planned on immediately leaving and getting off the site for a while since the other person plagued it.\n\nThe message said something like,\"I know it's you, and if it's not I'm sorry for confusing you, stop acting 13 and get out of rp if you don't want people wrriting stories\" so it wasnt all that mean, especially by internet standards.\n\nI'll also say this right now: I don't regret doing it. It's what made me feel better in the moment to feel justice of some kind. After I sent it I just went to bed.\n\nSo the next day I'm on and someone just has the name 'looking for someone who basically told me to fuck off last night' and I thought that this person was talking about the other person who said I was killing the series, so I'm like 'yeah don't even try talking to them, they won't listen. What did they say?' And they said that this mystery person thought they were someone else and it hurt their feelings or something so bad that they self harmed.\n\nAnd I didnt admit the possibility that couldve been me. I just questioned why someone would go out of their way to tell someone that they made them cut themselves. Because people who really self harm dont do that. I didnt tell this to the person. I just said,'So you just want to let them know that?' And I guess they must have realized how weird that is because they left and I never saw them again.\n\nNow, I dont know if it was me that supposedly inadvertently made them self harm. I honestly don't believe that they really did self harm because again, they dont tell people about it so easily, even online.\n\nBut even if I did, it's not my fault that you can't handle being called 13. I didn't force you to hurt yourself. As someone who has struggled with this, it's nobodys fault but your own if you self harm. It is an addiction, yes. You can be pushed towards it because it's your way of coping, but there are plenty of other ways to cope.\n\nI know that this is controversial. I can already hear people calling me a horrible person because I dont feel bad. I dont care, I just needed to get this out here because I need to tell someone.",
