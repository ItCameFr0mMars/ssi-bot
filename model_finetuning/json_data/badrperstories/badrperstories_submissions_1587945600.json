            "selftext": "This was a role-play from last 2 months ago, right? I wanted to step out of my comfort zone (y\u2019know the boring old horror, mystery, medieval, romance, slice of life stuff) so I did want any other person did and made a forum. I use to roleplay on a third party site so yeah. After I sent out the forum, waited a couple days, I got this message, \u201cHey if you\u2019re looking to step out your comfort zone then join me and my friend in a roleplay?\u201d\n\nI pondered for a hot second then shrugged, what could go wrong?\n\nSo I joined the chat;\n\nGuy 1 \nShygirl2 \n\nSo me being me, I introduced myself and get to know the other two. Guy1 was pretty cool, he told me how he roleplayed, what he like and what he didn\u2019t like etc. ShyGirl2 was vague in her responses, I didn\u2019t push it since these two claimed that they were multi-paras. And on with the plot, so it\u2019s three teenagers that got thrust into a parallel universe and they have watched that tell them how long they have to live and it places everyone in a certain hierarchy.\n\nSo we begin to start the roleplay, they started off with these beautiful detailed paragraphs, I was impressed. Then I realized with each reply the responses got shorter and shorter. So me being me, I didn\u2019t say anything because, I also shorten my paragraphs in certain situations so I looked past it. Guy1 character was unique by ShyGirl2 had the most generic character I ever seen, blonde hair, blue \u201corbs\u201d she called them, the chirpy personality and she didn\u2019t have a single flaw in her body. My OC was mean as hell so there were some things my character would say and hurt your feelings.\n\nWhat does ShyGirl2 do? She \u201csensed\u201d that my character got assaulted. Not only that, further into the roleplay, in the parallel universe, ShyGirl2 had infinite lives, while me and Guy1 played it safe with actual numbers. Now the love interest are me and Guy1 (we discussed this beforehand) and Guy1 and ShyGirl2 are siblings. So while our characters to save their asses and develop a relationship, ShyGirl2 keeps inserting herself in the development. Everytime my character would hold Guy1 one hands, ShyGirl2 would \u201cwhimper in protest\u201d cause she feel left out and she keeps being clingy. \n\nOut of respect, I told ShyGirl2 in the OOC that she can\u2019t keep pushing herself and being annoying. She agreeed. Soon after our characters was living in this abandoned house because they were all wanted by the police, so I made my character sleep in an other room, not knowing that law and behold, SHYGIRL2 AND GUY1 SLEEEPT TOGETHERRRR. and that\u2019s not even the last of it, apparently they aren\u2019t \u201creal siblings\u201d because Guy1 was adopted by ShyGirl2 family and so what did that mean?\n\nShyGirl2 is now a love interest too and every chance she gets, she\u2019ll flash her boobs or make a move on him. Mine you that they\u2019re replies are getting shorter and shorter with each reply. So continuing down the road, our characters met somebody else  (which wa splayed by ShyGirl2, but now I\u2019m thinking about it, I should\u2019ve never made that happen), this guy( let\u2019s call him guy2) found everyone a place to stay but since ShyGirl2 female character is busy seducing Guy1, she makes Guy2 basically force himself on my character, my OC doesn\u2019t take that crap so she was about to kick him when, Guy2 deflected (wow didn\u2019t see that coming) and held down my character basically assaulting her. \n\nNow this is the last part, when my OC fell asleep and noticed the man missing, ShyGirl2 character apparently killed him when she heard what was happening last night with the help of Guy1 and wants to have *drum roll please* an open relationship. \n\nAt this point, I didn\u2019t know what to say, I was generally speechless. So I just typed a simple \u2018it was nice\u2019 and exited. Not only was the characters was off but the whole plot was ignored. This went from being in a parallel universe to frickening Riverside sub plot. So why did I stay so long you might ask, I myself don\u2019t even have a clue.",

            "selftext": "Okay this happened on an online a while back, like maybe a year or so.\n\nBasically, it was a Percy Jackson based RP and for those unfamiliar with the series, to summarize the RP, it took place in a camp for the demigods of Greek gods.\n\nThe mods were pretty much controlling and hypocritical but the Admin was the worst. I'll just call her Admin.\n\nShe and her mods wouldn't let anyone pick their own godly parents because they would decide it for us. Which is very odd for this type of RP since we couldn't exactly build a backstory without being allowed to choose what gender the mortal parent was but still.\n\nHowever, all her characters got special perks. A fancy tree mansion that looks like it should be on HGTV and if you asked for private housing for your character, she'd give you something that looks like a mini house or a toolshed. \n\nAlso? She loved trying to force her characters in ships with others but if you try to date before she 'assigns' your parent, she'll make your character and the other siblings out of spite. Also, it can be for something she just interprets as shipping, like just two characters of opposite genders bonding and she would get hissy. One of my characters was once talk to one of her 'interests' and all they were talking about was how they hoped they were siblings so they could have fun sleepovers and she was still weirdly jealous. Did I mention her boyfriend was in the server?\n\nOkay, back to what she did to my character personally. I wasn't having too much fun there so I invited a few of my friends to join so I'd have company and we had a blast.\n\nThen she decided to play as 'Aphrodite', claim my character as her daughter, and make her fall in love with someone else despite my character growing closer to a different one. She wanted the other one for her own character. So yeah, spite.\n\nWell, my character was poly, which she would have known if she bothered to let us make character profiles without her interference but whatever.\n\nSo, my character still went along with 'falling' for the new guy and still having an interest in her main one.\n\nRemember the rule about none of the unassigned dating? Well, when my character went after the guy she literally godmodded my character to fall for, she decided to punish her by godmodding Aphrodite to come and take her hair. When I confronted her about her hypocrisy, instead of trying to talk it out, she banned me.\n\nUnfortunately for her, I made a few friends there with the most active people in there, so after I got banned, they left too, leaving her with a desert of a 'group' that no one would return to and she ended up having to close it down.\n\nHaven't heard from her since.",

So much depth, lore, and plot development. I was so proud of it. I was so proud that I kept it running through so much bullshit.   \n\n\nI posted about this once recently. This girl in my server called A who basically told me I need to stop playing my character because she's had too much happen to her and it looks like the game is skewed in a mod character's favor. The argument there is that my character was created with the story, so obviously after 2 years, a lot of shit would have happened.   \n\n\nSo after she essentially did her best impersonation of a complete hypocrite and ripped apart me, my writing, my server, my character, and my character's stories - she went and got two of my closest friends in the server to consent to a love triangle with her character that is a carbon-friggin'-copy of my character's backstory. Which is just soooo fun.   \n\n\nAt this point, my character has been copied so many times in that server that the only thing that's at all unique to her are the ribbons she wears in her hair because I am possessive af about them. Just let her have ONE thing.   \n\n\nLately, it's like I can't even open discord without something that has to do with her or her character. I can't find the muse to write because I feel like everything I write will be picked apart and judged by her, so I'm just sitting here watching her have all the fun - which is exactly what she told me she thought I should do in the first place.   \n\n\nI want to kick her SO BADLY. She asks the dumbest questions and expects me to drop everything to hold her hand. And if I don't do that, then I hear through the grapevine that she's so sad because she thinks I hate her and waaaaaaah.   \n\n\nI didn't hate her before. I definitely do now. Every time I open up the OOC chat to say \"good morning\" or \"hello\" - I have to shut the Discord app down because all my fingers will type is \"I hate everything about this server now, and I quit. Fuck all you ungrateful assholes. Bye.\"   \n\n\nIt's probably just a phase that will pass, but it's honestly driving me so crazy. I have clicked the \"leave server\" button at least 9 times today and stopped only when prompted with the \"are you sure?\"   \n\n\nThis one player has managed to bring up every single insecurity I've ever had about my server and my writing, and my muse is just dead. I don't even want to RP anymore. I'm so mad at her for taking that from me. I feel like I can't trust my staff for not backing me on removing her sooner. I'm mad at myself for letting her get to me. I'm not even talking to my two friends that she's smutting with anymore.   \n\n\nThis is what giving up looks like.",

            "selftext": "It's me again, coming back with another tale of my encounters with a terrible RPer, or rather, a vent.   \n\n\nIf you remember from my previous post here, I've referred to the RPer as Gift (not his real name). So, Gift and I have been RPing in a RWBY RP server on Discord for quite some time now, and in my previous post, I've mentioned of his antics of bringing in more characters from games that don't fit with the theme of the RP.\n\n  \nIn the roleplay, he has been actively trying to get Ruby to fall in love with him. Of course, I let this slide since he mentions that the love would be platonic. But his lines would beg to differ. They were all poorly worded romance lines, in which I had to force myself to respond even if my gut feelings tell me not to. This went on for weeks, until he brought in more T-Dolls from Girls' Frontline to ease his so-called heartbreak when I, assuming Ruby's role t the time refused to let her character fall in love with his self-insert.  \n\n\nAnd ever since I've refused him, he starts acting *extremely* childish and will perceive any insults written in my response, or any hostile actions towards him in the roleplay as if they were directed to him. At worst, he will abruptly leave the Roleplay should I assume Ruby's role, then with her character express her *fictional anger* at him. At times, he'd reply with a massive string of one-lined responses and action scripts. I'm just so goddamn tired of putting effort into my responses, only to have it answered with a stupid one/two-lined response.   \n\n\nI should've ended it all when things went downhill...",

I've heard about the site before but never actually checked it out, and it looks like there's a couple of groups dedicated to fandoms where people submit anything related to it, as well as rp ads on there. But I want to ask, before I actually do step into it to give it a try: how good is RP on this site, generally? I enjoy writing more than a few lines per reply, my posts tend to get quite lengthy with a few paragraphs in them. I guess what I'm asking is, are the people who rp there the same kind of people who do one liners and don't really put much into a RP? It's the impression that's giving me, but I want to ask and see if anyone has any experience.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the sub for this but you guys always seem really nice and approachable when it comes to advice in the rp community.\n\nI've been struggling to find an rp discord server that strikes my interest. I'm a paragraph style roleplayer and most of the servers I find within the genre that I'm interested in are not this style and very often full of teenagers. No shade against teenagers, but I turn thirty this year and I just don't feel comfortable writing with people under eighteen, regardless of the theme. It has nothing to do with mature content but more the fact that most underaged roleplayers I've come across are extremely immature. I'm also not a big fan of using drawn images for characters. While I can appreciate manga and anime, I just cringe into myself when I see servers full of anime images for people's characters and that seem to be the trope on most discord servers. It just comes off as that immature style that I'm trying to avoid. \n\nI really just want that eighteen plus only server with people who do paragraph styled roleplay.\n\nThe thing is, I love building my own settings and I've been musing over a setting (apocalypse) for a while that I have mostly done but I'm afraid of taking the leap and opening it. I have never opened a server before all alone and I don't even know how to do that. I have friends in the rp community, but those that I know are still active are more interested in 1x1, which is fine but personally I prefer groups!\n\nI'm at a loss. I have tried reaching out to some of the directory servers and asked if anyone is interested in helping me but no one got back to me.\n\nAll I want to do is just write and have fun.",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer, since I know someone will take this the wrong way: This does in no way, shape, or form apply to ALL MEN who roleplay, this is just my experience with one male partner which seems to mirror a lot of posts that I've read on here from girls with similar stories.   \n\n\nI was looking for dark romantic realistic plots on tumblr and connected with this dude, he informed me that he is looking for partners as well and that he'd love a dark romance. What I had in mind was something Gone Girl-esque with some smut included. To clarify, it wasn't a smut-specific roleplay, that was never discussed. So we hop over to Discord and begin plotting, it's going great I am getting rapidfire responses and I think to myself \"oh great, finally a partner who is excited and won't jump ship.\" \n\nAlmost immediately, the first problem arises. He tells me who he wants to use as a face claim and I send him pictures of the girl I had in mind; first thing he says is \"she's cute and has a nice body too\" before proceeding to occasionally send me pictures of her from her Instagram while we plot, with crude things such as \"I can imagine (insert his character's name here) c\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* on her face\" or \"I can imagine them going at it in the shower and him bending her over while the wife is sleeping\", stuff like that. I kind of brush it aside since I want to get to the logistic aspects, such as family dynamics, last names, occupations, etc. \n\nHe calls me 'babe' in the ooc, which I ignore as well since I am excited to have a partner who appears to be invested in the story and wants to get things going. After every one of his replies thus far in our roleplay, he messages me with \"was that alright let me know if my post was okay\" and \"hey\" and tells me \"I would like to talk more ooc\" after we've.....been talking ooc....I enjoy talking ooc as well but I never have to announce that to my partners, it just kind of happens.\n\nAt this point I have lost interest in the plot and he hasn't replied since the day before yesterday, nor has he messaged me ooc. How should I proceed with this situation? Just tell him that I'm no longer invested?",

            "selftext": "Hey. This is my first post on Reddit, so please tell me if I made any mistakes. Anyway, I'm just going to get right into this story. So, for context, I roleplay on Discord a lot because of the large variety of roleplays and how easy it is to use. I am in this Discord server that is about a high school used for hiding monster students. I'm like, \"alright, nice!\" I spend more time in this server, and everyone is pretty nice. Of course, there are a few immature people, but other than that it's all good. \n\nHowever, what I didn't know about this server is that most of the people use very specific anime images off of Pinterest. See, I'm alright with anime pictures as long as it's only used as a reference to get a general idea of the character. I just think you need to make the description differ a bit from the image, though. I sometimes use manga characters because they're black and white so I can add some coloring to them and then I can make them differ from the original image, and, you know, just make them their own person. I'm ready for the downvotes. However, the people in this server use very specific anime pictures and do not make the species different at all or do anything creative. What I mean is that they take an anime boy with a lot of accessories and creativity and all that with full color and just the whole package. To top it all off, they also didn't put where they found the image or even mentioned that the picture wasn't there. \n\nThe pictures aren't the only issue, though. Apart from the appearances, the character was still pretty bad. Most of the people would make extremely boring, cookie-cutter characters with about three traits. These traits were usually: Funny, caring, and kind or cute. It got boring fast. Not only this, though, but almost everybody made characters that were specifically angels or demons and sometimes a mix of both. These characters also usually had a 'split-personality' or a 'dark side'. I'm an admin here too, as I have poured some heart into this server and its suggestions. I knew that none of those were reasons to reject a submission without the person submitting the character getting angry. As you can imagine, it is very boring to roleplay with them. \n\nSo, I'm still in the server right now. I really love the server and the people are really nice but they're just not the greatest at making characters. I'm planning on telling them that they need to start making characters that aren't really as boring or the same as every other character that they have ever made soon, so wish me luck.",

            "selftext": "I have a lot of stories to tell, having owned a consistent group for going on three years now. We have a core cast of about 7 to 9 active at all times. I don't like growing past 13 because that'd make for just way too many plots going on at once. I also am just not a fan of having to meet 5 new characters a day when I'm trying to get some development in for my stories. Anyway! \n\nOne thing we do in our group is occasionally open up three slots at a time for disboarders and redditers to apply. We're not desperate for more people, but we like to see if someone can surprise us now and then by being a perfect fit. Our standards are a bit high because we love our plot and don't really want some random DarkWolfMorningStar waltzing in tainting it. So, because of that, I'd say our accept-to-boot ratio is 1:19. That may seem like a lot, but if you've ever had to recruit through disboard... you know what I mean. \n\nOver the years, we've turned down over 300 new people. That makes for a lot of hilarious and weird stories. I couldn't possibly tell them all, so here's 10 to start with. Have any of you other mods/admins experienced these?   \n\n\n1. A minor joined our group (back when we weren't strictly 18+). We had rules at the time which stated minors could not rp romances with other cast members unless they were also a minor and there was no funny business going on OOC. Well, we only had one minor at the time, so they had 0 chances of having a romantic relationship. They proceeded to rp two characters at the same time, and joined every single rp scene just to rp their two characters eating each other's faces. They never interacted with anyone in the rp. It was really weird to read and made everyone uncomfortable. This person essentially made us go 18+ from then on. \n2. A couple joined (which is always a red flag, because their problems tend to be twice as worse.) The female hated rping with other females, and the male hated rping with other males. In OOC chat, they would constantly be sending sickeningly cute messages to each other. For example, \"hey, so me and my girlfriend (OMG BABY I LOVE YOUUU xxxx) are going to live together when I get back from bootcamp.\" Eugh. Anyway, the girl didn't want to read the rules, and whenever a mod told her she was breaking a rule, her boyfriend would white-knight hard and try to lecture people in her honour. \n3. Another discord roleplay disbanded, leaving five people stranded without a home. So, they came and all joined our group at the same time. We usually only take three new people at a time, but we were feeling particularly motivated that day to give them a shot. What's the worst that could happen? Anyway, their 'leader' proceeded to tell me to impress them, because they \"collect rp servers like baseball cards\" and need to be \"convinced they should stay.\" Yeah, no. Goodbye, pal. \n4. Our roleplay is a medieval high-fantasy gig with homebrew lore, so there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to religion and faith. What I want to know is, what is up with the sheer amount of OP players looking to play a blazing, famous paladin here to smite the damned? We let a few people play more modest paladins, but they always give up their pursuit to have their little crusader fantasy when they realized we have characters that aren't pushovers. You need to -work- if you're trying to change someone's opinion. \n5. The application process we have includes a questionnaire where we ask some questions to gauge the applicant's personality. They are opinionated. For instance: \"What are your roleplay peeves?\", and \"what do you look for in a roleplay group?\" We once got a girl that joined in and managed to get offended by every single question somehow. Her responses were toxic with attitude and sarcasm. This is actually a semi-common thing we see. You'd think people would want to play it cool until they gauge the group first? One of my favourite lines she gave us was, \"honestly, you might never even encounter my character. My character won't give a crap about what's going on. She's just going to stick to her farm away from town.\" Okay, then why bother joining a group rp? We told her that she gave us an awful vibe and she responded with: \"I'm not a morning person. Still tired. But your loss.\" - And then left. \n6. One time we had a very heavy DnD guy join our group. We do use minimal dice, but we focus on story-writing most of all. Dice are very optional with us, and we don't want to restrict the writing flow with too many mechanics and systems. This guy, after being told repeatedly that we weren't a DnD group, kept trying to overanalyze absolutely everything. From spells, to lore, to plots. He'd pull up DnD spells and systems to try and explain his character. This was before he'd even bloody made the damn thing! He could never answer a single question without first prefacing with a whole paragraph of text explaining the system he was emulating. It was as if he couldn't creatively write without supporting himself on something from the DnD manuals. The final nail in the coffin was when he couldn't even write his first introductory paragraph, after being given a whole day to write it, because he was trying to explain his type of magic in the OOC channel. I told him that if he can't even prove to us he can write, that it ain't even worth it. \n7. The time we had a desperately obsessive ex-member. When this guy joined our group he was over the moon. He kept complimenting how neatly it was structured, and how stable it seemed. I love myself a good compliment, so that was a good way to break the ice, I'll give him that. He was an interesting lad and got along with everyone for the first few days. I kept giving him more and more time to make his character because we really care about OOC interactions as well as IC, so  I had a good feeling about him. Usually I only give new people a day to put a character together, but that's only because I usually don't believe they'll stick around long (we all love our ghosters, don't we?) He just kept procrastinating and only talking in OOC. Eventually I had to just kick him because it was clear he wasn't going to join the rp, and just wanted to meme around. This guy... set his discord status to \"\\[MY SERVER NAME\\] PLEASE FORGIVE ME. PLEASE TAKE ME BACK!\" And I was like, woah... that's... weird. So I spoke to him, and he told me about how he was crying because he was booted, and how he was a failure, and how he can't keep a group because he's too prone to ghosting. Apparently something he couldn't help? I told him that's not a quality we're looking for and blocked him again. He kept adding mods to try and convince them to let him back in. At that rate, it was getting a little weird. His reputation wasn't a stellar one after that so we just kept him blocked. \n8. Warhammer chads. Come on, I know you've all experienced them. We've had way too many warhammer-obsessed guys join the group trying to carry over their fantasies. The issue is that this really doesn't work for a lot of settings... especially not the one we run. We had this one guy that was using actual warhammer lore - referencing places, using images, using concepts, gods, etc. Now, we like our warhammer just as much as the next guy, but we couldn't stress enough that this was a homebrew server... and you need to use the lore that we've got in place. This guy then ranted and argued for ages saying that we could simply pretend that the warhammer lore was in relation to a land far away that his character is from. I had to give him a big ol' boot because he just wasn't listening. It was a shame, because he brought his girlfriend along. Usually I'm super apprehensive about couples, but she seemed really cool and eager to use the lore we had. If only she'd joined without him! But I could tell that she knew her boyfriend had ruined it for the both of them. \n9. One type of roleplayer that a lot of moderators absolutely hate to see is the infamous wallflower. This is a type of roleplayer that joins a session with other people and proceeds to add absolutely nothing to the scene. They sit there in the corner and mind their own business, barely giving anything to work with. They give nobody any hooks to go and encounter them, nor do they seem bothered to start up an encounter with someone else. We had a session with a new person who sat on her own at the docks when there was a group of people chatting away nearby. We gave her plenty of hooks to encounter us. In fact, one of us even yelled something that was intended to get her to join in. That roleplayer then wrote in OOC chat, \"(clown face) When nobody interacts with you.\" And I was so... so done. Don't you dare wallflower and then complain when you aren't getting interacted with. It doesn't matter how shy you are, or how shy your character is. If you want to be engaged with, you need to make it happen if others aren't coming to you. \n10. And lastly, one of my personal favourites... the I-Can't-Believe-That-Wasn't-A-Troll. This guy seemed absolutely legit the whole time he started out. He was funny to talk to, and shared a lot of interested that I had, so we could chat for ages. Being able to hold a conversation with a new person for more than half an hour is something I really appreciate. A lot of new people that join are either too shy to talk, or aren't interested in talking outside of RP. It was the first session where I got to roleplay with him after some of the other cast members were in my DMs saying something was weird about him. I had to see it for myself. It didn't take long to see the issue. He wasn't describing what his character was doing. Instead, he was posting youtube clips in the reference channel and saying. \"That's what my character's doing right now,\" and it would be a video of a basketballer laughing or pulling a weird face. The cherry on top was that this guy also didn't like roleplaying with characters that already had a significant other IC. As if taken people can't interact with other people? We're not an ERP group.   \n\n\nAnyway, that's just 10 prominent examples out of the many I have. Maybe I'll do a part two some other day. Hope you enjoy reading! And, hope your roleplays are going swell, everyone!",

So the day before yesterday, pretty late at night if I recall right, I had found a prompt on a sub reddit I really liked. I text the girl and we move to discord to discuss things better. We do, we make a server ans I make my character and wait... I wait... I was afraid that she didn\u2019t like my character so I asked for feedback. She tells me she was having lunch and she\u2019d be back in a minute. I was cool with that... I didn\u2019t expect her to be back that soon but probably around 20 minutes maybe half a hour. I still wait, 1 hour passes, 1 hour and a half, 2 hours. I decide to text on the general chat and decide to check if she was online. I notice she had left the server. I thought it was weird and went in DM\u2019s to see if I did something wrong or if she changed her mind but she blocked me there too.\nBeing the anxious person I am I\u2019m still overthinking about that and don\u2019t know how to get out of that... like... okay you didn\u2019t want to rp anymore... you could simply tell me... I would still be pretty disappointed because I kinda like the idea we came up with and was excited to play it... but I would have taken that well... but like this it makes me feel like they despise me or that I did something wrong",

I love me some slow burns and those gentle hand brushes between character's. I eat that *up,* but that's not what I see often. That's not what I get. \n\nI don't even mind doing romantic arcs. It can be fun and add drama, but so often it becomes the thing that defines my character's. Like after they get into a relationship that's the only thing that matters about them and their arcs I worked so hard on setting up are just more fuel for the relationship. It's like their end goals cease to matter as much as their partner and if they do they are the actual worst character ever.\n\nAny troubles that could arise from shady backgrounds become a danger only to their potential love interests. Their problems? Only to be solved by the one they make kissy faces with and sometimes people aren't even satisfied with that. Even my OC's with attitude problems are just expected to have their mess together because goodness knows a relationship can't have any rocky moments at all.\n\nHeck, even before they get into a relationship there's a good chance at being misconstrued.\n\nWhat about close friendships? Found family? Conflict between two personalities that should clash? You put two OC's together and sometimes someone's going to see sparks there when I just want a character to have a friend. Some of my characters are like literal trash (I enjoy dubious morality) but it ends up being treated as a weird '*uwu she's so feisty*' or they've legitimately done terrible things but that's okay because now the Power of Love is involved.\n\nI can't even have a character who's a bit flirty without it being seen as an immediate first come, first serve open season situation. Like no, she's just a flirt, and it doesn't mean much of anything to her. \n\nI've created a creepy little inhuman monster that doesn't even know how to pretend to be human and has an intense identity crisis going on because it literally doesn't know what to do with emotions. But because it's fleshy body looks like a woman, people want to get with it. Like, no??? It doesn't even understand what it's feeling, it's a monster.\n\nBasically, I'm just tired of the seemingly popular idea's that romance is the most important end goal for a character.",

            "selftext": "TW; heavy mentions of depression, suicide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been roleplaying in the Dragonriders of Pern fandom for nine years now, since I was thirteen years old. In that time, the fandom has been a home for me. I had fun. I learned to write. I made friends. I had some disagreements like everyone does. I saw some big blow-ups, because it's a small but active fandom and gossip spreads fast but viciously. But never, in my entire time in the fandom, have I experienced something like this.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say it started in a discussion in the Pern fandom discord. I said that I didn't like and wasn't particularly comfortable with male goldriders. \n\nSometime later, something really, really, really bad happened in real life. I've had some very difficult times since 2016, but this was *bad*. Coinciding with a flare-up in my depression, I had a falling out with my best friend. Then, in the midst of it, I received some news regarding my younger brother. I'm not going to go into it in any detail here, nor am I willing to, through messaging or otherwise, but I was scared that he was going to die and it was my fault. All of it combined and sent me over the edge and into suicidal depression. I was fully planning on killing myself at the time. In the midst of my breakdown, I DMed a friend who I had met through Pern roleplay. I'd known her since I was thirteen, really cared about her, and didn't want her to think that I'd ghosted her, so I told her what I was planning to do and thanked her for being my friend. She tried to talk me out of it, but I was too far gone.\n\nIn retrospect, I can see that contacting her and telling her what I planned to do wasn't a good idea. Please understand that I was not in my right mind at the time. I had lost one of my best friends. I thought that my brother was going to die and it would be my fault for not being able to protect him. I wasn't trying to suicide bait her or try to get her to talk me down. In my mind, it was already done. I was living in a world where there would be no consequences because there wouldn't be anything else after that. I just wanted her to know that I appreciated all the time we spent together.\n\nI didn't kill myself, obviously. Someone I barely knew noticed that I was acting weird and managed to talk me into going into inpatient. \n\nSeveral months later, I logged into a Dragonriders of Pern roleplay moderated by my friend. I hadn't logged on in a long time since it wasn't really my style of game and, in all honesty, the admin and I didn't get on too well. I'm not sure why. We never really talked, but we'd been on an old site together before and I got the feeling that she never really liked me. But I was bored, didn't have an active site, and wanted some light roleplaying to distract myself. When I logged in, however, I found that I was banned. I messaged the staff asking for an explanation. After a few days, I received a response saying that I had been banned for two reasons. (The following is paraphrased)\n\n1. I had said, months earlier, in the Pern fandom discord that I didn't like male goldriders. The site did not do gender impression. Therefore, I was not a good fit for it.\n2. I had caused one of the moderators a great deal of distress.\n\nBy DMing my friend while I was having my breakdown, I had triggered her. She never said anything to me about this, while it was happening or in the time that followed. Not one word. Instead, she vented to the admin and one of the other moderators of the site(some else I'd formerly considered a friend, although we hadn't spoken in a long time due to my real-life circumstances) and I found out when the admin, whom I'd never been fond of, informed me of the ban. A ban that had apparently been put in place months ago, but I was never told about, for they'd assumed that I left the fandom when I left the fandom discord due to safety concerns. (I had, and continue to have, a cyberstalker.) I felt bad, but also upset and betrayed, so I blocked the admin, my former friend, and the other moderator, and tried to move on.\n\nMy bad blood with that site caused problems for me within the fandom. They were small at first and I tried to ignore them, but they slowly got bigger and harder to blot out.\n\nAt some point, the admin of the fandom discord announced that they were closing. The admin of the site I'd been banned from decided to make a replacement. I wasn't allowed on it because I was not comfortable unblocking her. I'd attempted to make my own site a little while before this, and for all the work put into it, we were already having trouble attracting members. Eventually, I asked a mod if she could join the discord to advertise on my behalf. She agreed, but then DMed the admin of the discord. I don't know what was said between the two, but she tried to pressure me into unblocking the admin, and when I expressed discomfort and tried to explain that I was hurt by her going to her without first asking me what had happened, she lashed out. I ultimately left my site so that the mod wouldn't, dropped my old discord (I was already receiving harassment from my stalker and only kept it for the sake of Pern roleplay), and \n\nCut to today.\n\nI ran across a new site. I liked every aspect of what I saw. It didn't look like there was anyone on it who I had any sort of negative history with. I was really excited! So I joined the discord, registered, and started plotting. Everything looked like it was going well. Then a few hours later, while I was working on a profile, I switched to the discord tab an saw that I wasn't in the chat anymore. I opened the site up in another tab and saw that I had this PM from the admin:\n\nHey \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*,\n\nDue to concerns about your past behaviour I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I don't want my current members to feel uncomfortable for any reason, so I think it's best for everyone (yourself included) if you leave the site for now.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat was the entire thing. I replied to the PM agreeing, but asking for the admin to please tell me what behavior they were referring to first, as I was very confused. I received no response. Instead, my account was banned about half an hour later.\n\nThey never said what they were referencing, but it wasn't too hard to get an idea, because guess whose roleplay and fandom discord/resource site was listed in the affiliates. But I still don't know for *sure* and it's driving me up the wall. And if it is because of something that the admin or one of her friends said, it means that I was banned on a basis of gossip and rumors without hearing a word from my side.\n\nI roleplayed in the Dragonriders of Pern fandom for nine years. I've seen a lot of shit in it, and how horrible everyone said it was, kept coming back because I loved the world so much. It helped me through some truly terrible times. Now, I've been blacklisted across the fandom, by people I don't even know, because of something that was taken incredibly out of context.\n\nI don't know what making this post will accomplish. Nothing, probably. I've dropped contact with all of my former roleplay friends and don't intend to pick it back up. I just didn't want to let it end without getting out my side of the story.",

But I wanted to share because even all these years later- this seems wild to me. \n\nI was in an rp site playing an edgy character of mine. Let\u2019s call her T. Her bit was that she had been experimented on all her childhood by her family (of which there were 12) and by the time she turned 12, she escaped from their evil science dungeon/basement and killed them all in a blind fury!!! She also barely spoke and spent a lot of time with birds/could communicate with birds. \n\nI have no idea what the premise of the rp was. Only that my character started to gain a romantic interest with another character. It was going awesome until someone decided to ~reveal~ their characters ///secret/// past. \n\nThat past, was, she was T\u2019s youngest sister and survived. Somehow. Also she was super rich and had a mansion with trapdoors and secret bunker rooms and then tried to take T to court for her crimes??  All while trying to romance the same character T had fallen into a very cute relationship with. \n\nSo, none of this was consulted with me at the time. None of this was explained in their character sheet. Suddenly this character had ALL the things and power and OOC I got pisssssed. I freaked out (again, 12) and told her no, she couldn\u2019t do all that and I would ignore all of her writing saying she was T\u2019s sister or anything similar. \n\nThe rp never recovered and T hasn\u2019t been used much since, if at all. \n\nFunky huh?",

            "selftext": "Hello! First time posting here and I wish I wasn't sadly. \n\nSo I'm a very shy and anxious person. It took a lot for me to advertise wanting another rp buddy. Consider this... my only rp buddy has been my best friend and its hard to break out of what our routine is with another random person since that was the routine I used for 7 + years.\n\nQue the person I ment on an app on my phone for roleplaying. We've been talking now for a month and it's mentally exhausting and draining. They make roleplaying and chore and no longer fun for me. I have to constantly check my phone and if I'm gone longer than 10 minutes they freak out. Because \"that's their number 1 rule that NO ONE FOLLOWS!!\" \n\nNow I make it a point to never share my personal life with randoms on the internet cause my life is so screwed up and I don't want to burden others with my anxieties and depression. So I keep it simple and to myself.\n\nWell this person was constantly sharing their personal life so I thought I'd share my own issue. My boyfriend and I were having a small rough patch and I spilled everything to them. I was handling the situation my own way. \n\nWell... they told me they DID NOT want me to share my issues with my boyfriend because I wouldn't take advice from a stranger on the internet. So I let it be. He and I worked it out and are fine now. \n\nWhen I go to bed, they're an hour ahead of me. I sleep early because I'm used to that and my body knows when it needs sleep. Also I work super early half the time. They always make snyde remarks about me going to bed early. Note... I'm at least five years older than them too. \n\nLast night they made a comment about how I got to bed early even when I don't work. So I finally decided to defend myself and tell tbem my reason, and off course that never mattered cause their parents are older than me but they stay up later than me. Ok... good for them I guess. \n\nThe other day I has a bad spell of depression and cried all after noon and didn't touch my phone. I never messaged them all day cause I assumed they were mad at me anyway (over a petty thing most likely.) \n\nI messaged them the next day and explained myself. They didn't believe me or my 'excuses' because if they let it slide once then it'll keep happening. That really made me mad but sadly I can't bring myself to be disrespectful to a complete stranger. \n\nThis whole thing has been so exhausting and with my life as an essential work... it's been harder and harder each day to cater to them. We haven't actually roleplayed for over a week and have NOTHING in common... they have actually ruined roleplaying with others for me...",

( Not even character bios created yet, just still addressing the prompt) \n- What's the nicest way to tell them that you'd like to stop talking/RP? \n- Any other tips I could do to avoid further people like this? \nI usually emphasize on making the first message stand out so I can get a feel of the person solely because I fear that I would encounter someone like this...",

            "selftext": "So, during this RP, our characters are lost in the Amazon rainforest, or at least, a nice equivalent to it. \n\nOne character decides to look for plants. Rather than say \"This is edible\", we decide to be a little more realistic and come up with lists of plants that the characters would find... but don't say if they're edible. So one of these plants?\n\n...[Ipecacuanha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carapichea_ipecacuanha). One of these guys decides that he thinks it's edible... and decides to eat it. \n\nI tell him, OOC, \"...uh, are you sure you wanna do that?\" and he says yes. So what follows is I have to describe him throwing up since, well, he ate an emetic. After his impression of Lope de Aguirre from Amazon Trail is done (...come on, if you played that game, you 100% told him \"Try that - it's like candy!\") he tells me why the hell I did that. Well.... I did give you a warning that what you're about to do is... really not a good idea.\n\nThis resulted in the \"Ipecacuanha rule\" - in which if you do something stupid, but decide to go through with it after getting a warning, you deserve to have the consequences played to your character. Granted, this is pretty minor though - since it's just someone eating an entire bottles' worth of ipecac.",

I\u2019ve seen plots that a five year old could\u2019ve done a better job, and I\u2019ve seen fandom RP\u2019s go so south, a Brazilian man saw it fly by him and a penguin got yeeted into oblivion as it passed through Antarctica. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not a mean guy.

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been roleplaying for ten years and I\u2019ve been through it many times. I already know how it is. I meet an amazing RPer, we have mutual kinks, matches my energy. All of a sudden, ghosted. And I\u2019ll admit, in my early days (back in the early 2010\u2019s), it was mostly my fault. I failed to differentiate between RP and actual bonding. I\u2019d try to push boundaries and go outside of the roles and plot. Reasonable, and I cringe every time I reminisce on those occurrences. \n\nPast few years, I\u2019ve done a 180. Roles, characters, plot and nothing more? Fine. Willing to ditch all of that and go with a more personal experience? Also fine. I won\u2019t push it. I\u2019ll suggest either and be acquiescent to the partner\u2019s desire, the opposing option never being mentioned again. And it\u2019s gone well for the most part. There\u2019s definitely been a decrease in ghosting and more transparency has been offered. \u201cHey, sorry, been busy with work. I\u2019ll reply when I can.\u201d And I say ok to those folks and patiently wait for them. I\u2019ve even gotten a couple of \u201chey, I don\u2019t think I wanna move forward with this. Sorry.\u201d I say ok, wish them well, thank them for their time and that\u2019s it. What *hasn\u2019t* gone down is being ghosted by my favorite RPers. I\u2019m speaking as a cisgender heterosexual male who has RPed with an irl lesbian (needless to say, *strictly* roles and plot based) and a few cisgender non-lesbian females. The former has been a mix of people who consensually wanted to make it more personal *and/or* strictly roles and plot based. Regardless, I still get ghosted. \n\nI met this girl a few days ago in a Disc server. She posted an ad about looking for a male partner and even wanted to chat on the side. I messaged her and we chatted at first. She feeds more of an intimate vibe. So while I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I saw your RP ad and I\u2019m interested!\u201d She ends up being the one who goes, \u201cAww, okay love.~ \u2764\ufe0f\u201d and whatnot. I then ask her if she wants a plot / roles or just ourselves. She said she\u2019s fine with the latter. She herself then asks me if an irl picture of her is needed as a reference. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not needed, but if you\u2019d like to send it, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d She sends me a selfie. I say thanks and I ask her the same question. She says sure, I send her a selfie, she starts fangirling over it and tells me how cute I am. I thank her and ask if she wants to move forward with the roleplay, she says not tonight because she\u2019s sleepy. I say ok, and we chat instead. She asks me if I want a lewd pic. I say sure. She sends me one. I ask her if she wants one. She says no thanks, girls don\u2019t like that. I say okay and I don\u2019t send her one, then I start telling her about how I was formerly coerced by other female RP partners into sending such pics. Not as a rebuttal and a way to persuade her into wanting one (which, quite honestly, I don\u2019t know how telling that kind of story would have such an effect). I ask her if she wants to voice chat, she says sure but she\u2019ll have to be muted since her family was asleep. I say okay. We do a one-sided voice chat (I talk, she texts). She starts fangirling over my voice and constantly calls it cute. I thank her. She then asks me if this could be a daily thing, I said sure. I suggest a show to her about this guy who stalks his lover (I won\u2019t mention the name of the show since I don\u2019t want that to be the focal point of this post). She ends up binging on it. I ask her if there\u2019s a contingency medium we can use in case we lose contact. She says yes, but is at a blank as to which we should use. I suggest email, even say that it could be an anonymous or throwaway one to respect her privacy. She gives me her main email.  \n\nThe next day, we RP. It\u2019s amazing. Her style is wonderful. It\u2019s like she was in my mind and she knew exactly what I wanted from a partner. We talk on the phone that night, it\u2019s a great conversation. She asks me if I can call anytime during the day. I told her we\u2019d have to swap since my family likes to make a ruckus during the day so there\u2019ll be no way I can use my voice without interruptions. So I\u2019ll have to text and she\u2019ll have to use her voice. She says okay. \n\nThe following day, we RP again. It\u2019s wonderful. I hear her voice, I call it adorable. She thanks me. We have about a half-hour conversation which is relatively short in comparison to the previous calls. Later, we end up listening to music together on Spotify which turns out to be fun. That night, I call her and tell her stories (per her request) and sing her to sleep (per her request). \n\nThe next day, you guessed it, we RP again and it\u2019s the best one so far. We talk during the day (she talks, I text) but it ends up being different. 99% of the time, all I hear are keyboard clicks since she\u2019s talking to her group chat most of the time as they\u2019re \u201cblowing up\u201d. About 20 minutes or so of having that ASMR session of keyboard clicks, I tell her that I\u2019m gonna take a shower and do some errands. She says okay. Later that night, she asks if I wanna call soon. A part of me wants to say, \u201cIf you\u2019re just gonna talk to your group chat the whole time, no thanks. Sorry.\u201d But I refrained from saying that and I simply said sure. She tells me to hold on because she has to do something. She ends up taking an hour, doesn\u2019t apologize for the wait and we *start* our call at 1AM. We talk and video call. She turns off her camera several times during the call. I ask her if she\u2019s gonna turn it back on, she says no. I then ask her if she has any plans for tomorrow, she says she has a piano recital in the evening (and she has to cram in studying for that) but not for long. I say okay and I keep mine on. A technical difficulty ends up happening on her part and it takes around 15-20 minutes for that to be sorted out. I propose that we can just text, she says no. After it gets sorted out, I then end up singing her to sleep (per her request). \n\nThis morning, we have a brief RP session. She apologizes for turning her camera off. I tell her, \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was feeling self-conscious being the only person on camera, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d She tells me I don\u2019t have to feel self conscious since I\u2019m \u201cso freaking cute\u201d. I thanked her. We chat more since she was on the season finale of that show I suggested to her before. I know I said earlier that I wasn\u2019t gonna mention the name of that show, but I\u2019ll say it. It\u2019s a show called *You*. For those who have already completed season 1, you already know the ending. For those who haven\u2019t watched the show and have no interest in it, (season 1 finale spoiler warning) &gt;!it ends with the stalker guy (who\u2019s the protagonist) killing the girl \u2014 who did end up becoming his girlfriend \u2014 because she found out about his stalker ways and what measures he took to keep their relationship afloat!&lt;. Much like everyone else who has seen the show, she\u2019s completely shocked by the ending and we start talking about it. (Our specific discussion about the season 1 finale spoiler warning) &gt;!I tell her how it\u2019s funny that we justify the guy\u2019s twisted actions and it\u2019s intriguing to look at it from his perspective, since normally if we encounter a lover who\u2019s stalking us and whatnot \u2014 we will shut them down without hesitation. She agrees and asks me if I would love him if I was the girl. I tell her that if I didn\u2019t know about his twisted ways, I would love him because he did show a deep care for her. I ask her the same question. She agrees to an extent, telling me how she would love if someone was infatuated with her as he was to her. Then she goes, \u201cI know where you live, (my real name). You better watch out.\u201d I just laugh in response.!&lt;\n\nWe end up RPing a bit more and then she pauses to ask me if I see her as just an RP partner or more than that. Now, I\u2019m in a predicament. While I do like there being a personal connection in RP for some partners and I also like chatting with them, I\u2019m also not looking for a romantic relationship. I tell her, \u201cMore than that.\u201d She tells me, \u201cSame here, I see you as, like, a close friend or something.\u201d I sigh in relief out loud since I was afraid of her saying she wanted to be in a romantic relationship with me (I\u2019ve had previous partners suggest that before and let\u2019s just say they don\u2019t take rejection well). So I agree with her about the \u201cclose friend\u201d thing and we continue with a hybrid of chatting and mild RPing. She asks me if we\u2019re gonna RP tonight and call tonight, I say yes. We chat a bit more and RP a bit more. The last message she sends me is \u201c\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u201d. I remember I got up and stretched and I saw stars. I messaged her saying, \u201cWhoa... I see stars.\u201d What do I get in response? \u201cERROR: This message could not be sent since you are either not in a mutual server or the recipient has blocked you.\u201d I check to see if we\u2019re in a mutual server, yes. I now see \u201cadd friend\u201d, which means she deleted me. I try readding her, it says \u201cfriend request failed\u201d. Assuming there\u2019s another technical difficulty, I first email her (via an anonymous email) asking if she blocked or deleted me \u2014 then tried adding her on my alt. Friend request goes through.  So now I know for sure, she blocked me. \n\nI send a follow up email saying, \n\n\u201cNever mind, I just tried adding you on my alt and it went through. When I tried doing the same on my main, it says \u201cfriend request failed\u201d which can only mean one thing \u2014 you blocked me. Not sure what I did, said, didn\u2019t say, or didn\u2019t do. A conversation about it would\u2019ve been nice, even if it meant us reaching an impasse and parting ways. Well, I hardly check this email (this is the first time I\u2019m logging into it in months) so there\u2019s no point in even responding to this. Guess I\u2019ll just say while I do respectfully disagree with your decision along the way you approached this (or lack thereof), I\u2019m glad that we met. You\u2019re a good person and I wish you nothing but the best moving forward. \n\nTake care!\u201d \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s that. Haven\u2019t heard from her since. Don\u2019t think I ever will. Oh well!\n\nOh, and, important tidbit: we both are 18+. \n\n**tl;dr: Female RP partner who constantly called me baby, sent me hearts, asked me if I want a lewd pic / selfie, made me sing her / tell her stories to sleep, openly and frequently crushed over my physical appearance and voice ends up ghosting and blocking me just moments after I answer her question of whether I see her as a RP partner or more than that by bluntly responding with the latter choice (and just minutes after she tells me she knows where I live and confessing that she would love if someone was so infatuated with her to the extent of them stalking her)**\n\nP.S. I was not and am not physically attracted to her. There is a factor contributing to that being the case. While I won\u2019t mention what it was exactly out of respect for her and anyone else with that, just for the sake of *some* transparency, it\u2019s an unfortunate deformity. I apologize in advance if bringing that up makes me out to be an asshole, but I\u2019m *only* mentioning it for any preemptive \u201cmaybe OP was physically attracted to her\u201d comments. The attraction was one-sided (from her-to-myself) and that\u2019s it.",

Although they are as eager as I am to get started, I'm starting to feel a bit weird whenever asking to plot with them. I mean, it feels like we're not communicating enough about what we want, yet they always say, \"Go first since I might not know what you want\" even though I'm the person putting out ideas for the majority of the time. I mean, they do have some good ones in there and I do understand not being confident enough to share your idea but I'd love if they'd communicate that to me. There's also the nagging feeling that I'm not always asking the right questions whenever I'm plotting with the specific person, so I'm confused on where I should start.  \n\n\nAlso, I tend to ask what kind of rp they're going for. (Ex. Slice of life, A more linear, story oriented play, or crack, etc..) I do mention what universe they might want, and I tend to focus on storylines after the original plot of said universe is done or au's like, \"What if X did this, yadayadayada\", or \"What if we focused on what happened during the 4 year gap between games?\" I'm still unsure on what I'm doing wrong?",

            "selftext": "So...this is a story I used to cite quite a lot when I first got started in roleplay. I started out by learning ERP, and from there, found that I quite enjoyed the development of character and story, as well as the smut. Anyway, it was my first foray onto a 3rd party roleplaying website. I made a post for a monster hunter RP, something akin to Van Helsing (2004) but not set in that world or time era.  \n\nBefore I continue, I should state that I had cut all ties to my ERP past: i got a new kik handle, a new email, and used entirely different usernames. In short, only the most expert, Sherlock-level sleuthing would have revealed a connection. \n\nSo I am contacted by a male roleplayer. I'd already stated that my preference was to roleplay with females (I honestly couldn't care less now, but back then it was a hard point for me) as my experiences with males had been, even if I didn't want it, to turn the RP towards smut. Well I was told that this individual could redeem his gender, that he was willing to write a fresh writing sample instead of a copy paste (incidentally, my first encounter with the term \"writing sample\"...can you tell I was a baby RPer?), and that he had ideas for a story and characters all fleshed out, well I was quite excited. \n\nI told the man that I was not new to story writing, but that I was new to roleplaying so if there was anything I should be aware of, to be patient. He agreed and sent me a writing sample. it didn't match the quality I saw but I was new to this and figured, since he'd said he'd write a fresh one, that perhaps he'd rushed himself, hence the lack of quality and length. I accepted, took some mental notes on things I could do in the future, like setting up writing samples ahead of time, and  waited for him to continue. He began outlining his story. It was quite decent, if simple. Essentially, my character, a female bounty hunter, had been running out of work; in this world, monsters were less and less frequent, as compared to about ten years ago, when they used to run rampant and seeing a Bounty Hunter was quite a big deal. In the current world, seeing a BH was like seeing a cosplayer in full costume; interesting to look at but otherwise ignored. She was reasonably popular back in the day but lost her fame due to an accident during some operation. His character was a fellow BH who has been working with a coalition of other BHs and makes a decent living. Our characters knew each other previously and his happened to run into mine at a bar after his was finishing up a job, right as mine had been getting ready to leave the area to go search elsewhere for work. Apparently, he had knowledge of what happened at this operation. \n\nUptil now, I was a happy lady. Exciting story, good and gritty character development (I swear I'm not doing them justice), a really good hook. Then came the flirting. His character woudl incessantly flirt with and make suggestive comments towards mine. It was fine initially because I was told in the character bio before we started that his character was a ladies man and loved to flirt. Fine, no harm done. But then the flirting started to happen in more and more tense situations and, just the way it was written, with unnecessarily sexual detail, you could tell that it wasn't meant to be written as some sort of defense mechanism of the character's. Pretty soon it went from verbal flirting to full on playful handsy-ness (read; molestation), literally all over the place; outdoors in public, during missions, constant \"accidental\" walk-ins on my character bathing or in otherwise compromised situations, etc etc. It got to where we're facing a Vampire Elder, in our world a feared individual, one of nine. They were extremely overpowered, able to sense living beings, smell them out, etc etc. Our worst nightmare, short of Dracula himself popping by for a snack and a quick hello. It so happened that, during combat, my character was thrown into his character, and both were launched through a wall, then fell through some rotting floorboards down two stories. We made it alright and were under the rubble, with my character still on top of his as he'd chosen to use his body as a shield. \n\nNow, it's all deathly silent, our character can hear the now blind and partially deaf Elder trying to find them and they realize silence is their best bet. So what do our characters do? They try and control their breathing to calm their heart rates down. Well, mine did anyway. This guy decides that right now, NOW of all times, is the time to try and make dat booty clap. What does he do? He full on gropes my character's ass, and, I quote \"feeling her up, using the excuse of assisting her out of their predicament.\". I stopped it there and asked him in OOC, dude if you want smut, just ask for it. \n\nBut no no no, he didn't want smut at all. No, he's not into that sorta thing. Not at all. He simply was developing and playing to his character as believably as he could. And oh how offended he was that I'd suggest that. He was half a mind to not continue but since I was a cute first timer, he'd be happy to play. -\\_-\n\nSo...yeah. If you want ERP. Just. Fucking. Say so. Chances are you'll get a no and that's it.",

            "selftext": "Have y\u2019all ever had a recurring dream? \n I haven\u2019t, but it seems that every time I go to search for rp partners, the same scenario happens without fail. It\u2019s come to the point where I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m the one doing something wrong, so this is also a bit of a \u201cplease help\u201d post. \n Some background: I\u2019ve roleplayed for several years now, first on a social media app, then personally with my friends. Some time ago both my friends became very busy, and thus I decided to step out of my comfort zone and go talk to strangers on the internet again. \nI\u2019ve tried different forums and different approaches to this. The outcome is always the same - the only exception would be creepy older guys that don\u2019t seem to understand the word \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\nBasically, every time I try to start a role play, I get ditched. \n I always try to show my best side while searching for rp partners. I try to come up with unique plot hooks that have a lot of potential for both action and sol. I make sure that me and my partner have common interests and ask if they have potential scenarios they want to explore. I don\u2019t want them to feel like I don\u2019t listen to them. I make sure to know and respect their boundaries and I sometimes have to discard some of the things I originally wanted to do, so that the partner maintains interest. I make an OC for literally. Every. Plot. I really think that it\u2019s important that all characters are custom made, but I never pressure my partner to do the same. I establish that time differences and schedules don\u2019t matter to me, as long as it works for the both of us. I put thought into background characters, world building, magic systems, potential conflicts. I make extra stuff such as artwork, collages and such. I make sure that the other person doesn\u2019t feel pressured regardless of what they do. And then...\n\nFull. On. Radio. Silence. \n\nSome actually say that something is wrong. I respect them. Some are busy. Some say I type too much (which, by the way... They didn\u2019t even see me actually write a villain introduction. Those are my longest ones, usually.) But most just kinda... leave? And it\u2019s frustrating because I put a lot of effort into the set up. Like... If you don\u2019t wanna rp, just tell me and then I won\u2019t waste my time! And since it happens so often, I just don\u2019t feel like getting that involved anymore. I don\u2019t wanna have my characters and my world be underdeveloped. But every time I start talking to a potential rp partner, I already know that I\u2019m gonna get ghosted. \n  I\u2019ve been trying to find a good rp partner for more than half a year now, without a single success. So I\u2019m concluding that it\u2019s probably my fault. But then what am I doing wrong?? I don\u2019t understand! I really miss role playing, and it\u2019s frustrating when I do my best to make a set-up where we both have fun, but never get to try it out. What am I doing wrong?\n\nTLDR: Try-hard gets ghosted by people for half a year. Help wanted.",

I'm a fan of romance, action and adventure so we rarely found common ground in terms of rp. One day he asks me if I want to rp, so we set up a plot, saying how it's gonna be a grand adventure, we set up a party of adventurers that he could do his smut with and it had enough adventure planned to keep me happy.\nThe rp begins, my character who was just a guy working an office job is transported to a strange and magical world, before him he sees a giant stone tablet depicting a goddess that speaks to him, telling him she was trapped in the stone by a magical staff, and that it must be used to free her, and if she is set free she can return him home. \nI want you to take a few seconds to think about this, god knows what trapped a GODDESS, a literal goddess that can bend reality to her whim, guess where the staff is, take a moment to make a guess.\n\n\n\n\nIf you guessed it was leaning against the stone tablet you're correct! The plot is done, no big adventure to take on an army while assembling your own, no action, no adventure, no buildup.

            "selftext": "I know a lot of people find themselves in a situation where RP Friends wanna roleplay or do something specific that you don't like or you're not really into. Like, you're in an RP group and you find you don't like RPing with a specific person or specific character so, unless it's an event with everyone involved or you just naturally run into them IC, you generally don't interact much in the RP. Then that person asks if you wanna RP and, despite not actually wanting to, you still say yes because you don't want to be rude. And then there's the person on the receiving end who also doesn't want to be rude by saying they're getting that vibe.\n\nAs someone who's been on both ends of this situation, I say to both ends; please, be honest about it.\n\nWhen one person isn't having any fun, it's usually noticeable, but on a subtle level. Like, in my past situation, there's enough signs there to make me worry I've done something wrong, but not enough that I don't fear I'll piss someone off or make them feel like an asshole if I ask about it. \n\nYou just get a point where one side forcing themselves to do something they don't enjoy while the other side is getting progressively more self-conscious because they're getting big \"I'm constantly talking about the people I'd rather be RPing with\" vibes from that side. My experience was a lot of excuses they can't RP (while quickly after RPing with others), constantly having the RP cut short by repeated problems that only seem to occur with me and then when the RP actually gets going the person is more brief, doesn't really interact and mostly sits around talking about the other characters they love to RP with. \n\nIt's better to hear the truth at the start instead of spending hours in an awkward and sad rut. It'll hurt, but it saves both people a lot of trouble.",

I had a character already that basically fitted the plot and just needed some minor retouching here and there... and then... I\u2019m still waiting for his character... we talk during the day so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s too busy to rp and I tell him that I\u2019m waiting for the character... he apologizes and tells me he\u2019s typing it out... but still nothing... like I don\u2019t think it takes you two days to create a character (a well done character might take few hours, maybe?)... so... my question is... am I right to remind him that I would like to start this rp before I get in my 40s or should I just wait?

We roleplay characters interacting, eating, sleeping... sometimes we may even tell when they're going to the bathroom. But why does their sex life have to be so vanilla? It's fantasy. It's imagination. Have fun, people.\n\nNumber two, **Romance, romance, romance and... more romance?** Like seriously now? I may be too cynical for my own good but the traditional, romantic, eye to eye, missionary intercourse won't always do it for me. Can't they fuck hard and say \"I love you\" *after*?\n\nNumber three, **No dignity for my characters whatsoever**. What the fuck does \"This is a woman's world!\" mean after you reject their advances? What's up with shaming their desires? Can't you say no without laughing at them?",

I don\u2019t mean there has to be the toxic/abusive relationship but maybe some times PC can be in a bad mood... can maybe even see someone and think \u201cdamn he/she\u2019s hot... but damn I\u2019m taken\u201d... can sometimes over react over stuff, can get pissed off by MC, can not always be willing to listen...

Now when this happens I usually prefer my character to have some interaction with other side characters, usually to put some hints about something that will come usefull later; so usually when I want a certain type of interaction with the side character I describe the side character and give a hint about their intentions, like I describe the kind of relationship they had with my character and all that stuff. Then I add some thing such as \u201cSD approaches MC, seemingly anxious to tell him something\u201d. And then... my partner sends me the post and it\u2019s all about his character doing his business... which kind of throws me off because we had agreed that he should have played the side character.\n\nI make it clear in advance that when I use the typical formula \u201cSC approaches mine...\u201d that means that my partner should take over SC, and my partner agrees to that... so I kinda hate having to tell them every time to take over SC.\n\nOr another thing that annoys me is that sometimes my partner makes his character clearly despise mine so much that the character doesn\u2019t want to interact with mine so he usually avoids him. Since usually me and my partners play something that results in a relationship it\u2019s kinda annoying that each time it\u2019s me that has to force the interaction because it\u2019s obvious that their character doesn\u2019t want anything to do with mine... I even pointed out that once to one of my partners and I think they got offended because they ghosted me... like, it\u2019s okay to have the typical anti social guy but don\u2019t make the character too difficult to deal with otherwise it\u2019s annoying",
