            "selftext": "TW: ... I feel like there should be a trigger warning but I don't know what it should be. I was 8 and in spite, or because, of that, some kinda kinky stuff was shoved on me.\n\nAlright, guys, gals, and enby pals! Sit down and buckle up for the recollection of a memory that had long been resigned to the depth of my subconscious but was recently dredged up. I have to live with it and so do you.\n\nY'all are talking about being ghosted and shitty mods and toxic fandoms and yeah, that's all bad, but we can all relate to those. Here's an experience that I hope is a bit less universal.\n\nThe year was 2003. The Iraq War was just starting, the Space Shuttle Columbia exploded, and SARS was going to kill us all. I was 8 years old and I had recently discovered Neopets. Now, Neopets, in accordance to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, did not let you browse the NeoBoards before the elderly age of 13.\n\nThere were, of course, games and shops and other stuff you could still access. I was satisfied for a time, but the 'boards loomed in my mind. What did they do there? What did they discuss? What even *was* a forum? \n\nThere was only one way to find out: I begged my mom to fill out the parental consent form, and in her blissful ignorance of what awaited me, she acquiesced and faxed it in. Six to eight long weeks later, it was finally processed, and I was allowed inside.\n\nIt was then that I discovered roleplaying.\n\nNow, I could tell you many stories where I, myself, was the bad roleplayer. My command of the English language was limited to that of a precocious third grader, and yet, still better than that of several adult partners that I have had in recent years. I lurked for a week to try and learn the rules of roleplaying, and I think I managed to avoid the most grievous of sins, even if my characters didn't always make the most sense. I lacked an appropriate amount of parental supervision, but hey, it was Neopets! What, my mother thought, is the worst that could possibly happen?\n\nMy fourth roleplay ever was a \"family rp\", and I played an 8 year old girl. I didn't feel comfortable playing characters older than 8. After all, a 9 year old had significantly more life experience than I did, and I was not yet confident in my ability to accurately portray someone in the *fourth* grade, let alone older! I informed the group of this when I was asked if I could play a parent instead. They found my reasoning as flawless as I did, and the roleplay began much as many others did.\n\nMy memory is a bit shoddy on whether this person joined before or after me, but eventually their character (my character's teenage sister) got mine alone and things began to get weird. \n\nShe wanted me to change her diaper. The first fetish I became aware of was AB/DL, and it was because of this girl.\n\nI was uncertain why a teenager needed her diaper changed, but I was 8 years old. I was uncertain of a lot of things. I was new to this hobby, and I thought it was fun. It was like playing House at school, but the other kids didn't bully me, and I wanted to keep it that way. If I denied this girl, *my ic teenage sister*, a diaper change, would people still want to roleplay with me?\n\nMost likely, yes. But children are not known for their superb decision making.\n\nI changed her diaper. My baby sister had been born a year prior, and I know how it worked. Which was good, because she wrung as much detail out of me as she could. I very specifically remember this taking multiple posts.\n\nAfter that, she drove my character to the mall, and wanted me to push her around in a stroller. How could an 8 year old push someone old enough to have a driver's license around in a stroller? It didn't seem physically possible, but I got that stroller out of the back of the car and got her out of her car seat and into the stroller and got her pacifier and bottle and baby bag and all that and set off. I recall being proud of myself for the attention to detail.\n\nWe weren't more than 10 steps into the mall (or, possibly, we were, but I only remember the interesting part) before she went poopy and had to be changed again. So I, an eight year old in both the roleplay and real life, hunted down a bathroom and asked her to sit on the changing table.\n\nShe did, and in *her* post, it broke, and she also had a diaper blowout and started crying. Guys, I was so stressed. Like, I was legitimately, incredibly stressed. How did I handle this situation? What could I possibly do? I had a little sister, but I also had parents, and this wasn't something I had experience with!\n\nWell, I had to figure something out or nobody would roleplay with me ever again!\n\nSo I started from the top. I gave her a pacifier, and she stopped crying. I took off her onesie, and started cleaning her up and changing her diaper.\n\nIt was at this point that my mom had to call someone, and since we had dial up, I lost my internet connection. I wanted to go back and apologize for poofing, but the board was gone by then. I can only imagine that the moderators saw what was going on and deleted it.\n\nUnrelated to this incident, Neopets was also the first place I saw porn, of both the human and furry varieties. It was a site to behold.\n\nI'm really tired, so please excuse both the unnecessary verbosity and any typos you may have found.",

            "selftext": "So like almost 10 years ago (Jesus I feel old) when I was just starting roleplaying I decided to just dip my toe into everything and discover what I liked. So I did an OcxCannon. I think it was based on twilight. Yes cringe I know but I think vampires are (words I can not say). So I tried the Edward x whatever icy character wanted to play. It started off fine and we talked OOC, she specified that she wanted my Edward to be as close to the books as possible. So I was like ok cool so he's already married to/has a baby with Bella so it's going to be platonic roleplay. That's cool. But oh no my partner threw a hissy fit saying how Edward and her oc we're destined to be, but I reminded her that she wanted it as close to the movies/books as possible.\n\n So instead of discussing it like the not adults we were, she decides to brutally murder Bella and the baby, got really detailed about it too like she was plotting it forever. So I was like ok well naturally hed be devastated and like kill the oc. So I started to go that route when this girl just starts doing it by herself, y'know? Rping for me, doing whatever she wanted my character too, it was cringe and got nasty real quick. I kinda just ghosted her but seriously, a cannon character isn't gonna just change to cater to your fantasies. (I also no longer do cannon anything. Still very much into vampires though. )",

            "selftext": "About a year ago, I tried out this Twilight RP (I'm not a big fan of the books but I do love vampires and wanted to keep an open mind).\n\nAnyway, I'm much better at OC centric RPs but this RP was more or less canon characters only with only the mods being allowed to make OCs. Kind of bummed me out but I went along with it.\n\nUntil they explained that the RP was solely going to follow the books from start to finish, plotline and script. And since I entered later, they wanted me to play some girl I can't remember the name of but she was one of Bella's human 'friends' (friends being used lightly). It was the one that was jealous and passive aggressive towards Bella and basically the fake 'friend'. And I wasn't allowed to alter her personality to fit my style because I hate playing characters that shallow and 2 dimensional.\n\nI normally don't mind playing a canon character but it gets boring if we literally have to just follow the book. Like, you may as well just read the books. And with the pacing of the RP, I knew my character would literally become irrelevant after the first 'book' and only make brief appearances in the rest of them.\n\nLike, way to make someone feel welcome in an RP server by literally giving them a role that sits out most of the time and only comes in to be jealous of the girl with the personality of wet plaster.\n\nI honestly didn't stay long and left after a day or so of fruitlessly trying to work with the mods.",

            "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m not too drastically skilled in the rp scene. I\u2019ve been doing it for about 3 years now, and originally got into with the help of MMOs such as Black Desert and Final Fantasy 14. Getting to live through a character at all times ingame really helped my confidence. I\u2019m a quiet guy, but play a female and always have because it\u2019s just comfortable in a way I can\u2019t really explain.\n\nAs for the title, most people here who\u2019ve played those games mentioned are most likely familiar in the ERP scene that sticks around places like the taverns and what not. I started out there, which I\u2019m fine with, because some great friends in an actual established FC picked me up before long and set me on the right path. Because of my character being female and me being not so, I\u2019ve always been sure to keep things strictly third person, both to prevent bleed (which I\u2019ve sadly fallen into and did not enjoy) and to just make abundantly clear that my character and I are explicitly not the same. I am my character\u2019s writer. I always enjoyed the perspective of me being the invisible force that guides my character along, like a narrator in a story, but people who insist that I write first person because it\u2019s \u201cmore immersive\u201d really catch me off guard.\n\nBecause of me being a rather shy and non confrontational person, I try my best to oblige the requests for the change, even if I\u2019m not a fan of it. It usually isn\u2019t that big of a deal, but once I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve gotten myself stuck in a hole of my own making, it\u2019s tough to get myself out without throwing my current partner for a loop that looks like it\u2019s out of the blue. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, how do you all deal with a situation like this? I\u2019ve found a love for really fleshing out my character and putting my heart into her more than I thought I would at the start of this whole rp fascination, and I won\u2019t let those who are blatantly rude walk all over me of course, but something about writing my character through my own eyes, especially in the intimate sense, just doesn\u2019t feel right.",

The one thing I know I\u2019m good at though, is character background.  I prefer to play fandoms and, unless I know I can portray a canon 100% accurately, then I choose to make an oc.  Now all of my ocs have clearly written backstories that explain how their related to the story, the characters and the overall theme of the fandom itself.  I just feel like no one even gives me a chance because they\u2019re afraid of Mary-Sues.  I\u2019ve edited my characters a countless amount of times and have four that I tend to play, all of which have been, as far as I can tell, as developed as they can get by themselves.  It\u2019s just frustrating when I work so hard on them and no one will even give them a chance.",

            "selftext": "I'm on this forum about Harry Potter RP and found someone who had a partner search listing very similar to my interests. We both wanted to do something with Hermione involved and also Draco. Upon PMing her we began discussing and I was at first interested. but the way she wrote and some of her interests (upon further discussion), I realized were not really what I was going after. I was interested in erp and while we shared some ideas, it seemed like she wanted to do a lot of kinks that I'd never done before. Including magic that I honestly have no idea even existed and pairings that I didn't even know people shipped. We did share a few ships and interests but the overarching idea seemed to be that she wanted to do ships or ideas that I didn't even know about \n\nI also hate to sound this way but the way she also sent messages gave me red flags as to what kind of RPer she would be. It made me uncomfortable so I decided I needed to end this discussion just to be fair to her and before we started any possible rp. \n\nI let her know that I wasn't what for what she was looking for (said I didn't know many of the kinks and wouldn't feel comfortable playing them since I had no experience in them or the ships). She was pretty unhappy with me and said I shouldn't have inquired if I was going to change my mind. She was also angry and made that clear when she said I wasted her time. Issue was that I didn't know her other interests until I PM'd.\n\nHas anyone ever changed their minds while inquiring or being inquired? And is there a way to do it without the other party being upset/feeling led on? I want to just learn in the future to do it in a way that I let the person know their time was really appreciated and that I changed my mind not for personal reasons but for their time, so they didn't have to waste it further.

Let's call them...Shay.\n\nI posted in an NSFW group that I am in since the day I made my Reddit account. It was around 8:30 at night (I live in the Pacific Timezone). I got a couple of replies from my roleplay post. Nothing new. Then there's Shay. We hit it off. Made some badass ideas and practically have the story all figured out. Seems good right? Well mind you, we're in different timezones, he is somewhere 9 hours ahead of me so obviously replies will be a problem.\n\nThen there's the roleplay. Roleplay seems slow, for the build up. Even though it was slow, I kepy my attention on it for a while that I lost track of time. It went from 9 PM to 2 AM. I did warn Shay saying \"Hey it's 2 AM where I am at, I am going to sleep and we can continue this when we have a flexible time for us. Goodnight.\" I waited about a few minutes to see if he will reply. I assumed he was busy and maybe later he will see my message. I went to bed and carried on the next morning.\n\nI woke up with a message saying \"How dare you leave in the middle of a roleplay! The roleplay is barely building up and we're about to enter a good scene...\" On top of that, he called me a terrible roleplayer along with other names.\n\n1. It was just the beginning of the roleplay and there is barely anything interesting. We're just basically having our characters introduced.\n\n2. I did say that it was 2 in the morning at my end and I was getting tired. I thought he would understand.\n\nWhen I tried to say that I was tired and apologize...I got blocked.\n\nAm I upset? A little because he doesn't understand what the fuck timezones are. Am I hurt by it? Eh. I mean there are people like that, so it happens. Will it happen again? Hopefully not.",

Reading these stories I constantly look for my name or someone who\u2019s like me to be pulled up. I wanted to speak about my first rp. And I know, I know, \u201cit was the first one, so I deserve some leniency\u201d but this was bad, like bad, bad. It was a pretty simple rp, slice of life with no romance and two roommates. It was something about a guy suddenly being transported to a different world, which this guy who I was doing with had made or something. Keep in mind, I\u2019ve never does before. My guy was a lanky, awkward alcoholic, who was constantly depressed or thinking he wasn\u2019t good enough. All semblance of personality was replaced by vodka, or was replaced by blubbering and depression. I couldn\u2019t pace at all, so one time I\u2019d be blubbering about how my life is over, and the next I was building a treehouse. My \u2018roommates\u2019 were furries. Not like \u2018UwU yiff me papi\u2019 furries, they just had fur and scales and were humanoid. They were already together, and were expecting. There was this one point where my character was doing his usual crying with no pacing and I pulled a gun out, made it look like I was gonna ask him to shoot me, outside out, and asked him to get rid of the gun. I was so bad in my first, I couldn\u2019t detail, pace, or create a compelling character that wasn\u2019t an alcoholic who\u2019s main character arc is \u2018help me get over depression\u2019 even through all that this roleplayer has stuck by me. However, I have more. My second ever rp was a much more futuristic one, (it\u2019s also the one I\u2019m currently doing, fixed some stuff lol). My character was Kira, an ex slave who was also a CQC trained military combatant (somehow) and met up with this guy named scar on a desert world. (Abandoned, went over backstories and whatnot. Scar is also a furry) my character is supposed to know a lot about weapons, but often enough I end up getting it wrong because many things are from fandoms, so my knowledge isn\u2019t clear. She is very strong, and never in danger because of course. This was also the first time I ever... ERP\u2019d, so I was probably shot at that too. My first ever Naruto rp, I was so confused by everything my character just ended up becoming a whore. I could go on for hours honestly. I feel like I\u2019m the bad rper her. Not so blatant as some of these others, like yelling at someone for sleeping or banning you for something they forced you to do, but in the fact that I\u2019m just bad, and in the case where I was following a campaign, I tried to rush through it instead of doing it right. Detailing it pretty much. It makes me feel awkward and even sometimes discouraged me from rping.",

The staff are great and not too strict, and not too loose. Most of the regular members are great too, except for this one guy. We will call him faunus. This man has stated before that he was not from the US, and we were all cool with that. He joined the server with an edgy flaming wolf PFP with blue eyes. Not too bad, but when he created his character is when it got horrible. Now, I'm not an admin, but when I'm not in an RP I like to review the sheets. His character was a stereotypical gym bro with anger management issues and gets coochie on the daily. When it came down to the backstory, he was the brother of the Fire Princes. It was clearly stated on the template that all the royal positions were taken, but he argued to be one until his edgy fingers were cramped. They eventually settled for him to be a noble instead of being in the royal family. Then when his face claim rolled around, he wanted a weird hybrid furry. It had a damn tail and ears and everything. His excuse was that the animals in the world were hybrids, so why cant they breed a human and a wolf? That was wrong in so many ways.  They told him no and then he left. I celebrated on the inside a bit, but like an hour later he came back. He fixed the inconsistencies and errors in his sheet and got approved. When people in general chat started to playfully roast him about his pfp, and he lack of detail in his sheet. He then bragged about his iq which was 154, he could add more, but his HUGE BRAIN was tired so he didnt want to. Everybody laughed it up as he began to one line in every rp he participated in. Never one have I seen him write atleast 2 paragraphs. I dont dislike him personally, but I cant wait for the day my character has the excuse to whoop his ass.",

My partner and I connected right away and it had everything I wanted: magic, fantasy, description and most importantly taking things slow with a build up. We were planning to do a romance part of the story and I loved how he took things slow and real. (You can see I\u2019m really into this RP). \n\nSo a few days ago he started replying less and less and eventually told me that it was because of study stuff. I was like ok. I can wait days and weeks for a reply because I\u2019ll know it\u2019ll be good. But DAMN I\u2019m dying on the inside. Haha. It\u2019s been 5 days now with no answer or message letting me know he\u2019s still there. \n\nI know people need their time, I completely understand it! I also need it sometimes. So what I did was to search for some short term RP to pass the time. Boy oh boy how that went bad. It only made me more anxious because none of them were like the first one and my fear of losing that partner only grew. \n\nI was just wondering how you all cope with this? Because this is killing my insides for real LOL \n\nThanks everyone!",

            "selftext": "Ok so, for context, the server this nugget was found in is a Gor server, but nothing I'm saying is particularly sexual. Still because of the nature of Gor, I'll mark it NSFW.  \n\n\nWriting Partner and I have have had some Gor stories before that don't usually work out because I tend to work best in group stories rather than one on one but Gor servers tend to, across the board, be trash. The writing is typically illiterate (by which I mean poor grammar and spelling, barely legible) as well as generally being between one line and three lines. On top of that, because of the nature of Gor and its lore, if you're playing a slave type you're never really just owned by one person so if you're in a scene and your character's owner's writer isn't online - you pretty much need to make sure that you're not in a scene someone else can happen through because they can and will swoop in and take your character. Per the laws of Gor, there's not much you can do. Because of this Gor stories tend to be a mecca for edgelords who metagame and exclusively play OP characters that make no sense.   \n\n\nKnowing this, I'd always stayed away. I'm typically more of a novella style writer, so writing with people can't, at least, match me is just not fun for me. Writing Partner and I had pretty much given up on ever finding a server that we could grow those types of stories in.   \n\n\nA week and a half ago, my writing partner found one. He said the writing was decent enough that our posts wouldn't be getting spliced through five times per post and that the writers themselves seemed to all be mature adults. With some hesitation, I joined.   \n\n\nThe place is a shit show.   \n\n\nThe two main staff members are in an IRL poly relationship with the edgelord this story is about, who is not only not a staff member himself, but he doesn't actually know anything about Gor or its stories. That said, he still takes it upon himself to answer every question directed at a mod. And if you don't immediately take his word as law, the response is something like \"one of the owners is sleeping naked right behind me, I'm not going to wake her up for you.\"   \n\n\nOkay, buddy. I never once asked him to do that. Literally all I ever did was post a question into the ooc chat and then say \"whenever you have time\" or \"I'll post with what I think is right, but if it's not just tag me and let me know so I can edit.\" Literally 10/10 times I've asked a question and he's answered for his \"sleeping slave wife who is naked that he's not waking up for me\" - the answer he's given has been wrong.   \n\n\nBy his own admission, he's not a role player. He doesn't consider himself a writer. He's never read the books. But he also will tell everyone, over and over, \"I'm not a Dom. I'm a Master. I'm actually Master of most of the country at this point, everyone wants to be owned by me.\" He posted a selfie at one point, to like flex or something... Homeboy has a whole ass trainwreck happening in his face. Super weird flex. And probably the most tilting thing for me is that he continuously confuses me with my character.   \n\n\nIt's just this constant type of \"I own the owners irl, therefore I own all of the writers in here.\" Except I can't even begin to respect his character as any type of authority when he 1) doesn't officially have a character, 2) the character he sometimes seems to play is a Vampire, and 3) his *entire* posts are in markdown format.   \n\n\nI shit you not. He might as well be tagging the whole server with \"HEY EVERYONE, LOOK AT ME I WROTE A THING FINALLY!\" I say \"finally\" because in the week and a half that writing partner and I have been in the server - we're literally the only ones writing. The owners say they want activity, but they're letting people just sit for apparently months on end in the server.   \n\n\nHonestly, every little thing out of Edgelord's mouth is bullshit. He has this way, it's a skill really, of turning everything into something about him. One person will say \"oof, I'm so tired today.\" And his response, in true One-Up fashion, will be \"I'm always tired. My job is so grueling, and when I get home, I'm everyone's Master so I still have to work. Luckily I'm also the strongest man alive. Lol, get good noob. And I don't need to depend on coffee, because that's for weak people. It's sheer force of will. I'm so amazing, and tired, but like tired of being amazing sometimes but hey the amazing life chose me.\"   \n\n\nBut of course, no one can say anything, because he's the husband and boyfriend of Staff 1 and 2. I've had him blocked for the last four days because it's just so obnoxious to see him saying anything ever. You know that meme where the guy's holding up his hands and saying \"watch out, we've got a badass over here\" super sarcastically? Imagine the type of person who - everything they say, every time they open their mouth - that meme applies perfectly to. It's seriously so bad, guys.   \n\n\nAnd I guess he's picked up on the fact that I'm ignoring everything he says, because since I've started to, he's suddenly trying so hard to bro out with my writing partner, clearly trying to pull him into scenes where his character will hook up with other slaves so my character will be made redundant - which is hilarious to me. Obviously, I trust my writing partner. Even if I didn't, he's just hurting himself, since WP and I are literally the only active people in that server. If one of us goes, they're going to be two Masters NPCing slaves for themselves which will get old kinda quick.   \n\n\nJust needed to get all this out there. The guy is a fucking chode by definition. By his selfie, he looks like he's about 50, but his personality is that of a 9 year old. *Master of everyone*, my actual ass.",
