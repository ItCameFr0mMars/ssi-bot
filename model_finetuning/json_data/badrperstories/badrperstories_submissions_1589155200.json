            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nFirst time poster and on mobile so, I apologize for any mistakes.\n\nI have been a pretty avid RPer for around 10 years now. For the past 2 years or so, I've been doing all my RPs on discord. I am a member of several servers for people trying to find 1 x 1 RPs and ERPs. \n\nI recently posted about wanting to do a Naruto with my partner playing a canon character. In my ad, I was very specific about my expectations. One of them being that I have a hectic schedule and I do not like to be rushed for replies. I stated that I will do my best to reply to RPs once a day and I will do OOC as frequently as possible. \nAnother important note is the fact that I live in Japan so, my timezone does not frequently match with others.\n\nTo my surprise, someone responded to my post within a few minutes and I managed to get several OOC replies out to said person. After a good 30 minutes of back and forth, I went to make myself dinner (a sandwich) and did not reply. The conversation went as follows:\n\nThem: So. I guess the silence means you're not interested.\n\nMe: I didn't say I wasn't interested did I?\n\nThem: well, it's been 7 minutes and you didn't  reply.\n\n(This person literally counted the exact amount of time I was gone)\n\nMe: In my post I said I don't like to be rushed. It's okay for someone to disappear for a few minutes or even a day or two. \n\nThem: No it's not. You're supposed to say what you are doing and when you will return.\n\nMe: I'm not obligated to tell you what I am doing at all times. I don't think this will work out.\n\nThem: what ever, I'm not going to sit here and try to teach you how to be courteous.\n\nI ended up blocking the person and having to alter my ad to steer off impatient people.",

Recently though, I've seen a trend of selfishness within the RPC and I hate it. I can't just go with my usual partners either because they're either busy or dealing with something but I still chat with them regularly.\n\nI'm the kind of roleplayer that loves to play just about anyone or anything and I like that but I haven't found anyone from the recent times that shares my versatility. \n\nWhen I post ads on sites, I always put that doubling is required or versatility is a must. However, the people who respond aren't open to any of it and I get stuck playing a character for them. Hell, I sometimes get people that do like to double but they want focus more on their ship rather than both. \n\nFor instance, I had someone a little while back who wanted to double up but she got more enthusiastic about my male character than my female character. It's rapid-fire responses for their ship but it's like 2+ days to respond to mine. \n\nI especially hate it when I get people who police how your character should look and act. \n\nRecently, I've honestly just been ghosting left and right because it's just not fair. I'm really, really, really, burnt out.\n\nI honestly just want to give up on role-playing entirely and stick to writing on my own.",

            "selftext": "On /r/rpghorrorstories , I made a topic about someone called [Private Snafu](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/ewim0h/rules_for_thee_not_for_me/). We wound up actually taking *his* side.\n\nNow, the cast here is kinda large.\n\nWe got:\n\n* Me\n* Snafu\n* Kenku\n* Rogue\n* DM\n* Aasimar\n* Bunny \n* Druid\n\nMe, Kenku, and Rogue do *not* like Snafu. I had never met Rogue before. DM, Aasimar and Bunny like Snafu for whatever reason (However Aasimar and DM have ulterior motives which will be explained later...) while Druid is just more disinterested than anything. \n\nHowever, I am giving Snafu the chance he doesn't deserve... because he's actually *behaving* this time around.  He's also doing so on an *OOC* level too - which is super impressive. Kenku and Rogue instantly distrust Snafu's character, but my character actually isn't because well, Snafu's not done anything wrong to me IC and hasn't given me any *reason* to distrust him. \n\nSo what happens is, well, have you ever heard of that greentext story of North? The super tldr is that North was an incorrigible player who the DM and other players kept around just to antagonize for their own amusement. \n\nThis was happening here... except Snafu is nowhere *near* as bad as North is, at least, to the degree. (Snafu never plagiarised anyone's stories to run on SecondLife RP, at least to my knowledge.) Kenku and rogue were constantly trying to piss Snafu off IC. Snafu's character eventually started responding with \"Sorry, was that a bug?\", or just decided to let Rogue get beaten up when he tried to pickpocket in broad daylight and got caught. (Snafu *despised* Rogue in return...) \n\nEventually the DM is off, and Aasimar takes over. Aasimar is basically the DM's yes man. Well, Aasimar then gives us a combat scenario. One of her famous \"hard\" combat scenarios... which here means \"Enemies are psychic\". Snafu is on the other side of the area due to being a bow fighter, and they start going right after him. Not the rogue who tried to sneak attack (He would have been successful if it weren't for that meddling natural 19!), not me or the Druid who are closer, they go after the Bow Fighter, Snafu. \n\nSnafu decides to just run the heck away, and we take a few potshots at them. This doesn't deter them - they want Snafu's head on a stick! They're going right for Snafu like a player making a drow goes *right* for Drizzt stereotype. This makes no sense why they want Snafu dead - they literally ran right past squishies like Bunny they could easily kill because the bow fighter is more of a threat. So we end up on a benny hill chase scene before finally cornering Snafu. We catch up, and me, Kenku, Bunny, and Druid just repeatedly hit them as they all gang up on Snafu. Sure enough Snafu dies, and then and *only* then do they notice there are literally four (and now *six*) people who've ganged up on them - in fact several of their kind have even been killed due to Rogue succeeding a sneak attack and a few criticals by me and Aasimar. We win and resurrect Snafu.\n\nNext time DM comes back in and takes over, we report this to him because \"WTH\". Even though Kenku and Rogue are just fine about him dying. \n\nThis comes to a boil when I'm away - I come in apologising profusely for being late, only to find that surprise surprise... Aasimar had again attempted to assassinate Snafu's character through the use of an NPC. Rogue (Who it turns out is Snafu's *BROTHER*, insert soap opera plot twist music here) and Kenku expected me to back them up with this (as Snafu has used me as his punching bag several times... and my OOC dislike of him is quite well known) but I'm like \"...wth? Are you bullying him out of the game?\" \n\nWell I shocked them by actually taking Snafu and DM's side. Bunny and Druid also are just as appalled at this.",

This roleplay was advertised as the character being \"effeminate\" which I'm totally into. The poster mentioned 1-2 paragraph replies and helping the plot along. Sounds great! I have a character that's perfect! I'm imagining things as I send a message along. \n\nThings hit it off alright. I should have taken the red flag of \"I like writing intros but have trouble of figuring out where the plot goes\" when the advert said \"help the plot along\". But whatever. I can plot. Get into it. He has pictures of the character. \n\nHis character is getting married off to mine, and my character is one to think things through. He suspects that there's something going on underhandedly. Zivantiaxe though isn't cold, just doesn't like to show much emotion. You know. Because they're in Hell. But nonetheless he asked me to write Ziv more caring and love-at-first-sight which is out of character. Still, whatever. Shoulda been a flag again.\n\nSo, effeminate. Generally less masculine, sometimes ambiguous in form, but not a trap (for lack of better words). I'm into it. These pictures... are traps. And I don't really like them, I'm not into traps. Plus, this character looked like a child. That was my first thought, \"this is a kid\". As you'll see in the transcript, he says 'boundaries\"... which having a character that appears like a child in 18+ situations is **absolutely** a boundary!\n\nAnd my character was gonna be 32. He'd have noped right out, *\"Yeah nah I'm a devil, not a monster.*\"\n\nAnd this guy just immediately blew up without hearing my reasoning. Acting like a child, claiming hate and whatnot (as seen below) and blocked me within a minute of me saying I might not get as into it as I'd like, when their original post advertised a \"mature writer\". \n\n\n~~\n\n**Akitiki**\n\nWith pictures to be looking at (of his character), I'm still going to give it a good shot, but I'm going to warn that I might not be able to get as into it with that than I'd like to. It kinda crosses into some stuff that I stay away from so we'll have to see, really.\n\n**Them**\n\nI\n\nWhat\n\nI drew that\n\nLike I put effort into it\n\nIf you're going to be an asshole I don't want to do this\n\nYou could've kept that to yourself\n\n\n**Akitiki**\n\nNo, no. Hold on a minute.

            "selftext": "Obligatory mobile warning blahdiblah. This is also quite long. So uh.. length warning\n\nFor some backstory, I\u2019ve been a part of this amazing server on discord for about half a year now and I absolutely love it. The people are great and closely knit and the rp and lore is to DIE for. We\u2019re a very relaxed bunch and the rules are very different to your average rp server. Because it\u2019s so small, we all respect each other and we have fun because of the casual setting.\n\nInsert a new person which I will call Autumn because why not. She joined the server, made a character and everything was fine and dandy. Just kidding. Of course this person is going to stir some drama.\n\nMy first contact with Autumn was when I posted a new character I wanted to add to my arsenal. The owner, which I will call Kai, was already looking through it to be approved. There\u2019s a different format we use for powers that we post in another channel. And it was in this channel that the problems started.\n\nAutumn obviously read through my character\u2019s power and told me \n\n\u201cThat would be a very annoying power to fight against in all honesty. Can you out in a stipulation that makes it so that if someone breaks out of it they can't be affected again for another hour?\u201d\n\nThis girl, who just joined the server, was telling me what to do with my character as if she had been here longer than I had. This pissed me off because Kai thought it was completely fine the way it was and Autumn wasn\u2019t even a mod.\n\nI elected to ignore her, but the problems only rose. Within the next 30 minutes, she:\n\n- Demanded everyone to delete ooc by pinging everyone (\u201cIt isn\u2019t that hard to delete ooc.\u201d)\n\n- Said that someone\u2019s character was boring for not doing what they wanted them to do\n\n- Asked the same rper to add a bit more to the paragraph he made\n\nKeep in mind that, again, we weren\u2019t really that fussy with the rules. But the way that Autumn bossed everyone around really ticked me off. I dmed Kai about it and he said that he\u2019s leaving it alone because it can only end in two ways: Autumn adapts to the casual server and stops bossing people around or they leave because this server is so obviously not for them (the entire place is basically a group rp and one of the first things she said was \u201cI don\u2019t like group rps\u201d).\n\nI understand if they\u2019re preferences, but the way she\u2019s bossing everyone around to accomodate for her and for her only is really making my blood boil. No one in the server really cares about all the stuff she\u2019s making us fix and most of them are gritting their teeth and baring it. But no one bosses my friends around without some retribution.\n\nHow the hell do I go about this?",

            "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nSo, basically me and this girl I\u2019ve written with for over seven years have been going through a writers block. Recently, we\u2019ve decided to try writing a story together again, and things are going great. She\u2019s cunning on her writing skills and I\u2019m just dusting off the old keyboard.\n\nIn writing these new stories, we decided that we wanted to go all out and be bombastic as possible. Write new characters, develop new plots and everything like that. And things have been going great! I\u2019ve never seen us get this creative. Each character is diverse and different from one the other.\n\nWell...,unfortunately things have come to an angered pause for me. We\u2019ve recently made two villain characters. One advocates for the protection of the Elven populous (and she kills anyone outside of this), and the other advocates for the protection of the Winged Ones, which are essentially half human half angel people. This woman murders anyone who isn\u2019t that as well.\n\nwell, the two women are interesting enough, but over time, they\u2019ve become rather frustrating for me. For one, my villain character, who wants to protect Elf kind, is dismissed often as a whiny bitch. Her family is usually blamed for making her this way, and usually my partner writes those things. She wrote this whole arc where her family were under fire for \u201cenabling\u201d her to kill. And her character, the Wings girl, wants to somehow protect Elf from her own ruin by reverting her into a Winged One herself, making her start life over as that.\n\nHowever, their character, Wings, is praised for being noble and \u201chonorable\u201d for the deaths she takes. She\u2019s called beautiful, perfect, and some people genuinely feel for her story. They never blame her parents for the things they might have put her through. There\u2019s no increased anger and hatred towards her character. It\u2019s just fear or romance or even people saying they\u2019re noble.\n\nIt\u2019s only MY characters that I control that say anything against her, when I make sure that both sides attack Elf for the shit she\u2019s done.\n\nI\u2019m just kinda over it at this point. I think it\u2019s unfair that she\u2019s making Wings out to be a honorable ninja who gets no hate / not the same hate. And has my character Elf have her family dragged through shit, go through petty bullshit at her expense, be seen as some whiny bitch when she\u2019s a powerful villain, and receive no sorts of emotional support when she\u2019s upset or clearly hurting.\n\nFor an example, it\u2019s public knowledge that Elf\u2019s biological parents were abusive pieces of shit, yet everyone ignored it to cater to the sensationalized drama that her adoptive parents caused her to want to protect Elf kind from everyone else. In fact, the reason that my partners characters gave to Elf for not caring as much was that \u201cthey\u2019re already dead\u201d, so??? What? does that mean the abuse goes away? Her pain goes away?\n\nThough Wings, she develops her character to have people feel for her own pains and her own mysterious struggles, while my character just suffers in the background and is used as some fucking punching bag.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this. What the fuck do I do from here? This shit is pissing me off. I didn\u2019t write Elf to be some dramatic shitshow of a character. I wrote her to be compelling. And Wings is a cool character, but she\u2019s struggling on me a little because my partner is writing some sort of competition between them.\n\nThey aren\u2019t supposed to be competing. They\u2019re supposed to be rivals who end up losing at the end.",

            "selftext": "Roleplay storytime! Aka, the worst roleplay I have ever had. Or well, one of the worst. Shot version is at the end of the post.\n\n\nTW: sexual assault, attempted rape, attempted male pregnancy, \"depression\", cutting \n\n\nSo, this happened a few years ago. Back then I wasn't as strict as I was now. I have changed and adapted my rules so that shit like that can't happen again. Won't even sugar coat it. It was a disgusting experience. \n\n\nI am an advanced literate to novella role player, I can write up to a thousand words in one single response and so I wouldn't settle for people below my literacy, obviously. But back then, you rarely found anyone who could write more than five lines, so that was...disappointing.\n\n\nBut one day someone messaged me, saying that they were advanced literate as well. I simply believed them, because the other people who messaged me before and told me so, turned out to be advanced literate. Their grammar was a bit poor, but I decided to let it slide.\n\n\nThey asked if we could roleplay with one of my characters who was currently available. In his wiki, it said that he was a gentleman. A vanilla type of guy. Polite and sweet, calm and mature. Remember that.\n\n\nAnd their character seemed like an amazing match! They described him as \" flirty, strong, independent, sly and smart\" and I was so excited to roleplay with them. We settled for a master/slave roleplay. I didn't really like the idea of it at all, but my roleplay partner seemed happy and excited and so I agreed. Their character was the slave and mine was the master. Sure. I didn't mind. Their character seemed cool.\nBut shit went down after their third response.\n\n\nOne, their literacy level immediately dropped down to five/ ten lines which was something I certainly didn't like at all. I told them \"I'm sorry, could you please try to write more next time? I can't work with that.\"\n\n\nAnd they replied:\" O-oh..........Sorry....\"\nI felt bad after that but now where I read it again, it's just them trying to guilt-trip me. Unfortunately, it worked, because I simply told them it's fine.\nAnd then the second thing happened.\n\n\nTheir character changed his personality. He went from a bold guy to a stuttering shy uwu boy who couldn't say shit without stuttering and blushing. Mind you, he didn't have a disability. They just thought it was cute. (I asked them and that was their answer.)\n\n\nThen the third thing.\n\n\nTheir character went into my character's bedroom without his permission and knowledge and without mine. Yes, it isn't real and it's just roleplay, but what the fuck. Don't invade someone's privacy like that. To make it better, they saw sex toys in his room. A whip and something I can't remember? Handcuffs probably.\n\n\nAnd I'm fucking sorry, but what??? They never asked me if my character was into that kind of shit. They never even mentioned that they would do that. And obviously, my character was not into that kind of shit. He is a vanilla guy. He isn't going to spank you into the tomorrow land. And he wouldn't enjoy it either, which is my next point. He wasn't dominant in bed, which my roleplay partner obviously expected because he was rich.\n\n\nI told them to stop that and they pulled the whole dot dot dot shit again and skipped that scene to where they were eating dinner. I let it happen and decided to let them have a big and nice dinner together. Strike four. They asked me why my character was treating theirs like an equal. Why he wasn't hitting or yelling at him, why he wasn't abusing him etc.\n\n\nI know that slavery often means that the slave is treated poorly, but right before we started I told them that I won't degrade another human being, not even in roleplay. And they were fine with it.\nBut apparently, that changed.\n\n\nI ignored it and brought my character to his room since it was late and I wanted to let him sleep so that I wouldn't have to deal with their bullshit. I was pretty pissed off at that point.\nThey brought their character to their own room as well, but that dude didn't sleep. Nope. He started masturbating, thinking about my character spanking and dominating him. And then he decided to get up and walk into my character's bedroom, wake him up and ask if my dude could fuck him.\n\n\nI made my guy politely deny him.\n\n\nAnd then he started sobbing and stuttering, forced himself onto my OC and he started taking off my guy's clothes against his will. I made my dude push him off, telling him to get the fuck away from him and leave him alone. The dude started crying and wailing like a child, then ran to his room, came on his blanket and then started to cut himself for some fucking reason.\n\n\nProbably magically got depression due to cock block. \n\n\nThey then turn their character into an omega who is in heat and try to make my guy fuck him again because they wanted their OC, their fucking dude, to get pregnant.\n\n\nFirst of all, I stated in my rules that I don't do the whole alpha/beta/omega and male pregnancy shit because it makes me uncomfortable and secondly, their character was a human. That's what they had written down in their wiki. We never discussed the werewolf part, they didn't even mention it once.\n\n\nI left the conversation and blocked them after I checked out their bio (which was recently added and wasn't there before, I just noticed it by accident.\nThey were a twelve-year-old girl.\n\n\nProbably some young chick who thinks being gay is sexy because of yaoi. Big yikes.\n\n\n\nSummary: WP lies about literacy level and their OCs personality, attempt to change the OCs species, attempt to rape my OC, ask why my OC isnt abusing theirs. I leave.",

            "selftext": "So in my last post I told you guys how this partner of mine kind of ghosted me and I was frustrated about it. Thank you for all the advices by the way. \n\nHe still didn\u2019t come back though :( but I know for a fact that he didn\u2019t block me. However I decided then to start again my journey to find another long term RP partner. So one day ago I found pretty cool post about a RP and messaged the person. \n\nIn the message I made it clear I do not RP with one liners (super clear). He responded me and we start planning. It started just fine and then his answer started getting smaller and smaller until they are simply responses with ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE. \n\nThe thing is, we did already started the RP and I feel bad for stopping right now..... but I physically feel agony when he answer with just one line. \n\nTHE QUESTION: the best way to tell him it\u2019s not going to work out? \n\nAND A VENT: why do you accept to RP with someone that made clear that they are descriptive Partners and only RP with other descriptive RP if you are not one?",

            "selftext": "This post is about people who have very specific preferences, don't tell you about them beforehand, and then get angry when you tell them you are uncomfortable. My story begins with a 1x1 rp. My character was a teenage boy who safed a dragon from a circus.\n\nIt was clear that it was a non-romance (and no sex) rp, I explicitely told her that and she agreed. However, she began making comments about how my character would find her dragon character attractive? It was a literal dragon, not a dragon furry or a human girl with dragon parts. How he would blush when he sees her, and so on. Even hinting at how he would be...aroused when seeing her in a certain situation. I was confused as hell. Now I would get it if she expected him to be amazed by her beauty, I described how impressive she looked and how pretty and so on. But being aroused by a dragon...that is weird in my opinion. \n\nI asked my partner why she thinks this normal teenage boy should be aroused by a dragon. I just didn't get it. She said 'Why not, because of puberty of course.' and acted like this was totally normal. Yes, it would be totally normal for him to be attracted to her if she was a human girl his age (or a human boy, or a nonbinary person). But a dragon who is also at least twice his age???\n\nI told her that I felt uncomfortable writing that, and that it was honestly very surprised that she would just take this attraction for granted. She was...not very happy with that. She acted like it was totally normal and something was wrong with MY character because he wasn't horny for a dragon. The rp did not last long...\n\nWhat is your weirdest experience with someone who acted like their uncommon preference was totally normal and you are the weird one for not agreeing to write it?",

            "selftext": "Currently, I have a friend who is the only person I roleplay with at this moment. \nI've been roleplaying with this guy for a while, we became friends overtime because of our ongoing roleplays. He always admitted himself as a 'reactant' because he came from forum and group roleplays, which already has established worlds and sets of rules, etc. I, on the other hand come from mainly 1x1 roleplays, I was never a fan of group roleplays, even with my closest friends. I've been used to close collaboration with ideas, especially since this is an entire world being built. This means places, characters, lore, etc. I was fine with making most of it, but coming about a near 8 months into it, I'm tired of planning everything, and he doesn't seem to get it. Constantly, I'm saying, \"Hey, if you have any ideas, please tell me. I can't keep making them all on my own.\" He constantly comes up with the \"I don't know\" or \"I don't have any\" answer. Soon, a fairly large event that I coordinated comes up. (I'm still a writer in the works, I know it isn't perfect and with the event, came major flaws I looked over in the heat of the moment.) After the event happened, he begins to rail on about how things don't align. Yes, I became defensive about it because I planned this event out for most of the week. I eventually gave up into submission and admitted the thing itself wasn't great. I was torn over the idea, somebody may say, \"It's a growing experience, constructive criticism\" or something. It wasn't constructive, it was more about bashing how none of my ideas made sense, and it hurt knowing that it was just myself working on the event. I tried to consult the event with him and he once again threw the \"I don't know\" answer. More recently, it happened once again because I suggested an idea in-character, he tells me in the DM chat that it wasn't necessary. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore, it honestly feels like I'm stepping in a minefield with how I want this to go. I'm not enjoying roleplaying so much nowadays because of it. It just feels like my ideas are going to waste, and eventually the roleplay itself is going to cease because the ideas from myself is going to fade. It's a shame because he really was a good roleplayer, invested and detailed in his responses. I still stay true to putting my all into it, but him, not so much. More recently, he always brings up his other partners and their ideas and how good their storylines are, both present and in past. Hearing all of this discourages me, and I've done all that I can to improve as a writer. I'm still practicing on my own time to better myself. But, coming as a person who gets easily discouraged even from the simpliest of failures, it's driving all of my passion out of the window to roleplaying. \n\nIt feels like I'm just writing a book for myself at this point, maybe I should just end up doing that.\nSorry if it took too long, it just feels like I'm silenced from even the biggest passion I have had.\n\nI honestly can't tell if I'm overreacting, since it was something I was always told by this guy I do. I'm at an impasse here, and current circumstances away from the internet is really hammering my attitudes down to a pulp.",

            "selftext": "I've roleplayed a lot over the years.  I've done things casually with one-offs and minor interactions that were so brief I never even had to make an account.  There were only a handful of other times I've spent with more permanent partners, but out of those years, I have had two major roleplay/collaborative writing experiences:\n\nMy main original roleplay with my writing partner of 15+ years and the one that this story centers around.\n\nTo set the scene IRL I was in my first year of university:  Quietly filled with anxiety, battling depression, in the thick of relationship with an unsupportive and emotionally unavailable partner, majoring in something dictated by familial pressure that I had zero interest in, depersonalizing hard, and, to make matters worse, my writing partner was too occupied with life to correspond normally, making roleplay non-existent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's a person to do?  Why, join a forum roleplay that offers the perfect amount of escapism and distant socializing!  Perfect.  My other friend's roleplay, according to them, had an influx of awful writers and needed a shot in the arm my higher-quality writing offered.  I never thought my writing was anything special, but most people that read it thought it great and it landed me all the higher classes in school as well as allowing me college credits.  Either way, it was a nice solution for both of our problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI signed up, made my character and their profile, and waited patiently to be approved by the other admin.  My friend was an administrator as well, but both needed to appraise every profile.  Everyone else went through the same process and usually got approved without issue, but now and again characters/profiles would get caught in a purgatory if the writing in it was lacking or they did not write their biography in a detailed enough manner.  It was their way of vetting prospective members, but it was always with the expectation and goal of having them join, or so I was told.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I waited, my friend and I talked through private chats, with them explaining a little more of the finer points of the forum as well as who was who in the school.  You see, the forum was set up and played as a high-end, private boarding school, occupied by students and teachers that were either magical beings, mutants, or aliens (it still predated Monster High).  Most were run of the mill mutants with powers controlling elements, some were imbued with magic or some quirky ability, and a few students were mythical creatures, but there were two students my friend strongly advised me to avoid.  Apparently, they were *awful* to roleplay with due to their abhorrent writing.  They had gone through the school's \"writing\" class with one of the teachers and had not managed to improve one bit.  Much like their application process, they also had a \"writing\" class for roleplayers whose prose was not up to par.  It was a little meta in concept, but an interesting thing to have and perhaps when properly utilized, really got writers to up their game to keep the quality high and to retain an interesting character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept it never worked that way.  After being approved, I got to know the members of the forum and for the most part, many were average to normal people with completely adequate and acceptable skills in writing.  There was one member who stuck out.  Everyone viewed them as the undisputed best writer before I came and this attitude was clearly reflected in every post their character was in.  Audaciously flowery, painfully verbose, and utterly dripping with superiority-- and that was not including their \"dialogue.\"  Paragraphs and half pages were dedicated to their movements and abilities.  While I have always adored highly detailed writing from authors professional and hobbist alike, once it gets to the third paragraph praising one's grace and skill with a wand, the self-aggrandizing gets tiresome.  It becomes the writing equivalent of constantly having slow-mo on, zoomed in on one character.  For a character whose magical prowess is meant to be the focus, there were times they would launch into adjective-laden passages about their ebony hair, green eyes, and oddly, their large glasses.  I was treated to paragraphs of them being effortlessly beautiful without the need of makeup (not that they had time for such frivolous things!) and without the intention of being so, *so very* attractive in their no-nonsense outfit of over-sized shirts and shorts.  Whenever they would speak or address another character, it was consistently harsh and demeaning, hiding behind the thinly-vieled excuse of the character being very formal save the times they would talk to the characters of the admins or the friends of the admins.  However, *this* was the forum member trusted with being the \"writing teacher.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious to see why these two members were so shunned, I checked the sessions they had in the writing class.  What I found was scolding after scolding, pretentious corrections, and matters of style and preferences that are entirely subjective being picked apart and labeled as wrong and terrible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven outside of roleplays, one of the easiest exercises to establish character and some semblance of style and voice is to generate situations and locations for characters to explore.  Solitary writers use this tool to help flesh things out.  How did this teacher decide to do this with these two \"struggling\" students?  They sat them in a blank room.  It was not a spartan room, with few furnishings and only furniture deemed essential.  It was not an empty room, lacking decoration, windows, or personal effects.  It was literally a white room, *a void*.  Sure, the teacher mentioned the ability of them to conjure any item they desired, but it certainly seemed to defeat the very purpose of it all.  It entirely took the agency and power away from the students to explore the use of language and instead made a learning experience into another exercise in showing who held all the cards and who was favored amongst the higher-ups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsurprisingly, without proper guidance or direction, the two didn't know what to do or how to fully utilize the room resulting in their characters awkwardly standing around, feeling both lost and embarrassed, likely defensive over being put in the class to begin with.  Rather than reassuring them or taking the lead or doing anything useful, the teacher merely sighed heavily and before exiting the \"classroom,\" deemed them both \"hopeless,\" ending the thread.  With the only \"necessary\" character gone from a painfully unproductive and short thread, the two characters could only bid each other goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt did not convince me these two students were unsatisfactory writers, but did persuade me to avoid that \"teacher\" and never try to facilitate a scene with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that all happened before I joined.  Soon, the forum owner approved me and my writing was more than adequate (sparing me a \"writing class\") and soon I was sorted into the proper house (again, it was a boarding school that operated on a house system).  Many adventures soon followed (including threads with both those \"horrible\" roleplayers and some run ins with the writing teacher), but this is probably all anyone can stomach from me for now.

            "selftext": "My last thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/gbaxl0/3\\_years\\_of\\_yikes\\_part\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/gbaxl0/3_years_of_yikes_part_1/)\n\nSince a few of you asked for some more of my problem member endeavors in my long-term rp, here are a few more!\n\n1. We once had a guy join who referred to himself as a 'skilled dungeon master'. He proceeds to OOC hype up absolutely everything he's about to do in the roleplay instead of just doing it and letting us have our own reactions. Everything turned out pretty underwhelming and we all got a bit tired of him fairly quickly. The worst part was that he was just recycling old plots and trying to be the 'riddler' of our town by dropping random riddles on people and expecting them to get excited over it. Even if the puzzles were solved, nothing really came of them. It'd be the equivalent of giving someone a crossword puzzle and then... yeah that's it. He left the group when he realized we weren't that enthusiastic.\n2. On the subject of talking yourself up OOC instead of just roleplaying, we had some bloke that would constantly prelude every single post by saying, \"this is going to get dark\", \"this is going to get real\", \"sorry for my next post\", \"I'm about to drop some serious backstory on you\". Which, for one, is bloody annoying. Like the first guy, it was extremely underwhelming. It's just not fun to have roleplay spoiled before it even happens. We were all roleplaying out a party scene and he decided to start acting up again. Took up the entire session telling his whole 'grim' backstory while he was simultaneously explaining it in an OOC thread, too. It was a real downer.\n3. We've had a lot of people that think they can 'hack the system' and find a 'loophole' in not being given consequences for their characters poor actions by simply not playing their character. In one instance, we had a guy cause a very distressing public scene which would have warranted police intervention. Before the police could so much as walk up to them, they yeeted right out of the session and got all mopey OOC. In a similar setting a few months later, someone's character was staging a rebellion against an organization which, also, would have warranted at least an attempt at finding and stopping their character. However, they found out if they just simply didn't roleplay on days when the hunters were on, they'd never be captured! Needless to say, when we discovered their little ploy, we gave some behind the scenes consequences instead. Two can play at that game.\n4. A man pretending to be a policeman of all roleplay joined our server and spoke like an exaggerated copper. I have absolutely no issue with the police. A lot of my friends IRL are cops. This guy took it to a whole new level where it seemed like they were roleplaying a policeman OOC. We knew he wasn't one due to his apparent age. There's nothing wrong with having aspirations, but this was rather uncomfortable to read. He was policing what he thought was allowed in writing, and what wasn't. Among what wasn't, was that he'd be very disappointed if he ever saw 'cliches', to which he mentioned: \"fat people eating a lot\", and \"black people eating chicken\". We have someone that plays a black character in the group, to which we laughed and asked if they were supposed to avoid chicken from that point onward.\n5. This one's probably pretty relatable, but have you ever had someone join your server that just read absolutely nothing and still posted a character bio? We are a homebrew group with very specific lore. Nowhere does it state we are multiverse, and we very specifically say that there can't be any known game/movie/show concepts. This person joins in, skips over the introduction thread, goes straight to character bios, and plops down a crazy Undertale concept that might not even work in an Undertale rp. I mean we had a pretty good chuckle anyway, so I'm glad it happened.\n6. Someone (white) was in our roleplay for a short while during the beginning months (3 years ago) and thought that because their roommate was black and let them use the n-word around them, that they were automatically allowed to use it in the roleplay. When I told them to refrain from using any slurs, they called me a \"libt\\*rd p\\*ssy\" and told me to get over it. Well then! They also used slurs for pretty much everyone else because apparently being \"allowed\" to use one slur \"unlocked\" all of them. It was very difficult to stomach and everyone was pretty glad when they were gone. It was an awkward situation since this person was a long term friend of a few of us before the rp.\n7. This one girl was utterly obsessed in her pursuit to date me IC, and cared very little for anyone else in the rp. My character is very much married with a family and happily so. She'd constantly try to trap my character into positions where she was sure they'd cheat on their wife. However, whenever I'd deflect her and show no interest in doing so, her roleplay quality would suddenly drop to the bare minimum. She'd leave sessions as soon as it seemed like she wasn't getting what she wanted. Then, she'd berate the OOC chat with passive aggression just to indirectly tell everyone she was upset about the direction of the RP.\n8. A girl joined with a serious vampire fetish to an extreme where other people would leave sessions the moment she joined one. We average at one paragraph per post in our Discord rp just so the flow can keep going. This woman would drop down 3-5 paragraphs which were chock-full of fluff, backstory, and sexual thoughts about vampires. We're not an ERP group, and we did have minors in our rp at the time, so we had to tell her to calm it. One time she wrote a 4-paragraph post about verging on an org\\*sm because a vampire was biting her neck. She was extremely offended that we told her to avoid doing that, and demanded we give her an apology. When I told her to take a hike, she suddenly changed her demeanor and asked if we could stay friends because she wasn't used to people standing up to her.\n9. A well-loved member brought their girlfriend to the server, but she turned out to be an obsessive nightmare. Nobody was allowed to talk to her boyfriend without her intervening, and if anyone even dared to make a slightly cute joke toward him, she'd be like \"you and I are going to have a talk later\". He couldn't join any of the roleplay sessions without her shadowing him and making sure his characters ended up with hers. It made him start to dislike her and contributed to them breaking up. This girl was a proper psycho and almost a year later still tries to get back into our group to win him back. She's sent him IRL mail and made a billion new accounts just to get his attention. It's bloody weird.\n10. This last one is probably another really relatable one. We all love ghosters by now. This girl joined and really seemed promising. She did everything right. Had insightful OOC chats, filled out the application perfectly, made a great character, etc. Literally a day later she goes, \"oh! By the way, I am in the Peace Corps and will be back in two months to continue! This looks awesome and I can't wait to get started!\" Good for her, but I'll never EVER understand why people join roleplays when they know they need to go away for a while. We have seen this happen soooo much it's unreal.",

            "selftext": "Story time I guess!\n\nIn my roleplaying days, I had a multi muse account on a social media website. Mostly I had OCs, but I also had characters from different fandoms. I even replayed as YouTubers and in this particular roleplay we both sorr of portrayed YouTubers.\n\nThis girl messaged me and the roleplay was weird. Her character was an OC that was the demon sister of a famous gaming YouTuber who dated both her brother and his best friend. I was fine with the incest and the demon stuff and when she made her character neko and whatnot, but she HEAVILY godmod her character, claiming her character killed my other characters I was roleplaying as and nothing could stop her. This annoyed me because if she found out I was roleplaying as a character she killed, she'd flip out saying she killed them, even though she just said *kills Dan* for example and that's it. She also made fun of my smut writing publicly, which was annoying since I was a 14 year old virgin. However, this is all amazing compared to the end of our roleplaying days.\n\nThis chick got mad at me for not messaging her 24/7. I would tell her \"hey, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour, so I'll be leaving soon,\" and she would flip out, saying I didnt care about the roleplay and that her character could do better. I put up with this because... I don't really remember why. The plot was nonexistent and she was awful. Anyway, my grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer and he lived across the country, so my mom and I went to visit him for a week. I told all my roleplay partners that I would be gone for a week and I explained why. Everyone was understanding but her. She flipped out on me saying that was no excuse to not text her back. She tried to ruin my actual reputation by reaching out to my irl friends who had added my roleplay account. She told my roleplay partners I had lied about my grandfather being sick. She spammed me constantly. After al of that, she still expected me to roleplay with her, so I finally went off on her, blocked her, and sent screenshots of her bullying me to other roleplayers and screenshots of our smut to her parents. \n\nAfter that, I quit roleplaying on that website and only play Dungeons and Dragons.",

            "selftext": "Trigger warning: Suicide threats, self harm.\n\nTLDR:  RPer becomes obsessed with me and one of my joke characters, stalks me across multiple platforms and threatens suicide. This is a bit of a ride.\n\nThis happened many years ago, back when dial-up modems were still a thing, and your mother would make you get offline so she could use the phone.\n\nI was still in highschool at the time, and found my way to a Star Wars chat and roleplay page. It was my first introduction to roleplaying, and I was very naive.\n\nThe chat itself was a single page with a scrolling text box and different coloured fonts for different people and OOC comments. Most of the time, the mods would pick the plan for the day, for example an Assault Team Raid vs the mods BBEG or an off-topic, non-cannon day in the Cantina. \n\nAnything went on a Cantina day. Dragons, Anime characters, furries, pool parties, dinosaurs, whatever happened in the Cantina, stayed in the Cantina and it was usually was pretty fun and relaxed.\n\nI created multiple characters for myself, as most people did. A few were solely for use on Cantina days. I had a few female characters and a few male characters.\n\nIt was a Cantina day, and as usual we had a few new folks join in. One newbie entered and began flirting immediately with one of my male characters. A shapeshifter named Rip, who was at the time, a Velociraptor. Because why not.\n\nWhen Rip declined to buy her a drink, she raged OOC that I must be gay to not want to RP with her in the chat or via private IM. I told her sorry, I was a girl too and not interested in romance RPs.\n\nThis wasn't ok with her. She and her character tried everything. Describing over multiple posts the size of her breasts, jumping into the pool naked, jumping on him naked, laying on his back, putting his \"tail\" in her mouth, yanking his tail, scratching herself with his claws and yelling that she was now marked as his, and trying to climb naked into his mouth! \n\nAll the while posting rudely OOC that if I'd just RP with her privately, she would stop. Most of the oldies thought it was funny, I tried my best to ignore her.\n\nI began to wonder if she was trolling, or someone I knew but all my friends in the group were just as annoyed by her as I was and no one IRL knew I visited this chat.\n\nShe carried on until I eventually logged out. I wasn't able to go back on for another 3-4 days. \n\nWhen I got back, a mod immediately posted OOC to me that it wasn't funny and if I did it again, I would be booted. They explained that this insane girl had shown up for hours every day, using a login similar to mine (they added a 1 at the end), harassing everyone and attempting to start sexual RPs during cannon-event days and begging people to privately RP with her. They thought it had been me trolling!\n\nLuckily, as a long timer by this stage, I was able to defend myself, backed up by another mod friend. It was agreed that she would be ignored if she came back.\n\nA week or two later, she showed up again. She immediately flooded the chat to get my attention. Except this time, she knew my usernames I used on other non RP forums and games. She said if I ignored her, there would be consequences.\n\nI was more scared than anything at this point and agreed to rp with her if she would leave the main chat alone.\n\nShe agreed and insisted it had to be with Rip, except he had to be a human, with black hair and blue eyes and 6'5 and no tattoos, and totally madly in love with her because she was a shapeshifter too and she was also an angel and she was also a goddess and she was also a Jedi and honestly I forget the rest of her mary-sue bull. More annoyingly, she also completely redesigned what Rip had looked like. \n\nHer character profile picture was 3/4s naked Sailor Moon fan art.\n\nHer roleplaying was worse. She wanted them to be getting married so they could have \"lots of sex.\" When I told her I wasnt ok with it, she would godmode answers from Rip, for example \"no he doesn't say that he says this-\" and any time there was any sort of resistance from me in or out of character, she would begin to describe how much she hated Rip and would have to kill them both and started to describe ways she would kill herself and take him with her. Even godmoding him begging her not to. I called it there and said I didn't want to play any more. She left the chat.\n\nI wish that was the end of this nightmare but sadly no. \n\nI was flooded with invites to chat on every forum I was in. They were all the same \"I'm gonna kill myself because you don't love me\". \"I hate you\". \"I hate that I love you so much\". \"I hate you, kill me\". \"I'm going to kill myself\" and so on.. but it wasn't just me! Oh no. She had somehow found 2 of my IRL friends and was sending them messages about how much I'd hurt her and ruined her life! \n\nI was young. This was pretty overwhelming for me.\nI'd never even had a boyfriend.i didn't know there were people that behaved like this. In short, I didn't know what to do. I was naive as heck. Yes, I actually thought she would hurt herself.\n\nAll I could think of to do was to ask her to meet me back on the Star Wars chat- so I wouldn't have to talk to her alone. \n\nShe immediately started begging me to love her, saying how much I'd ruined her life because I wouldn't talk to her the way she wanted me to, and all she wanted was to RP with me because she really really loved Rip...and me.  And if I'd just go along with it and say what she wanted me to say then she wouldn't have to do it for me and then she would be happy because I wouldn't be hurting her..\n\nI just wanted her to stop acting so crazy.. so I agreed. \n\nI know, I know. \n\nFor a day or two she was fine- a little godmoding here and there when I didn't follow her script to the letter - but nothing as crazy. \n\nThen one day she comes on and floods the chat with details about how she and Rip had married in secret and had sex...with him as a Velociraptor and her as her ideal Sailor Moon goddess. That she had magically given birth to a baby boy she named \"Latherin\" and he was going to be the King of the whole chat and everyone had to listen to her now. She even tried to God mode everyone stopping what they were doing and praising her and bowing down.\n\nThe chat cracked up, totally done with her nonsense and asking her why she named the kid something that sounded like a brand of soap. When I laughed too and said there was no way it ever happened and agreed the name was silly.... she flew off the rails again. \n\nHow dare I laugh at my wife. She thought I cared. She thought we were friends and so on. That was it, she was going to log out and kill herself and it was all my fault. She leaves.\n\nIs that the whole story? Oh no. Theres more.\n\nA few weeks later, another newbie joins, posting calmly in well structured sentences. They ask after me. A friend from the chat sees it and messages me about it.\n\nI join and ask what they wanted. They claim to be the insane girls older brother. He apologizes for her behaviour, hopes that I'm ok, and says she won't be back again because she did try to kill herself and their parents won't allow her online ever again. \n\nHe says she told them it was my fault she tried, and their parents have asked Me to never contact Her again. \n\nWith that, he apologizes again and logs out. \n\nWho knows if he was telling the truth but the whole episode spun me the heck out. \n\nI stuck to playing female only characters from then on.",

We\u2019d be creating a team of four each (four girls and four boys) who would then come together to form one of the teams (or multiple teams) listed above. I just want to reiterate that these would be CANON characters. Also this would be a multiple characters kind of game. Four on Four at least. The Avengers Of Our Own and Justice League Of Our own are more classic hero minded while the Suicide Squad would be a villain type thing and so would the Thunderbolts.",

            "selftext": "So usually if I make pre-made OCs for RPing, I mish-mash current and past OCs together. A major time saver, and I get to reuse bits and parts of character's I've liked over the years.\n\nUnfortunately, I have a *ton* of time now. Instead of my norm of a name, short bio, and personality, I developed an OC with a 6-page info doc. The first and last page weren't necessary, and I could've shortened the doc even more by removing the bulk of the aesthetic stuff (columns, pictures, headings). But by browsing for RP partners more often, seeing other really pretty OC sheets made me want to put more effort into her! I wasn't going to Frankenstein her parts!\n\n**The document:**\n\n* Page 1: Her name and picture\n* Page 2: Basic info\u2014Personality / appearance / bio / powers\n* Page 3: Extra info\u2014Hair / clothing / accessories / etc.\n* Page 4: Trivia\u2014Likes/dislikes, more background info I might've thought of later\n* Page 5: Pre-made plots\u2014so I could have ideas for her if people asked\n* Page 6: Image credits\u2014it's only 2 links, but better more respectful than sorry!\n\nFour pages of content is *still long*, pictures or no pictures. I don\u2019t expect people to read once and memorize everything. I don\u2019t even have her memorized! At the same time, when people reached out to me wanting to RP against her specifically, if I was smart enough to ask what they liked, I got more replies saying they didn\u2019t read her doc than replies that say they did. Honesty is nice, but wow.\n\nOut of the 6 or so people who DM\u2019d me, I only chatted with 2 long enough to exchange info (it\u2019s easy to forget about opened DMs; it happens) and only one of them is RPing with me now. She\u2019s super sweet. Chatted while she made her character, asked to see stuff again, bounced ideas around so my original plot bunny could fit 2 people.\n\nWhile on the other hand, my other notable experiences had one guy telling me he thought my FC was an \u201cexotic beauty\u201d (a touchy \u201ccompliment\u201d for me since I\u2019ve gotten called that IRL as a POC; he clarified he didn\u2019t read the doc when I asked) and another individual who I don\u2019t even think scrolled far enough to even see I had pre-written stuff there (honestly should've said goodbye there earlier, but I was excited to use my OC; that was my bad).\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too unreasonable to ask for folks to skim something I worked hard on. I see people not reading as a common frustration among RPers. Having experienced a bit of everything, I'm not sure what's more maddening: when people point out they noticed you're not interested in X, but they still message for X anyway or folks who don't read at all.\n\nMy approach to reading ads, info docs, character sheets \u2014 you name it, if OP is asking for something I can\u2019t give, don\u2019t understand, or my brain isn't in the mood to read, I click off. If I'm interested, and I think whatever OP is looking for can apply to me, I read more carefully. My desire to RP doesn't mean I can disregard what they sat down to write. If it's too much, too little, whatever \u2014 I'll keep looking. Plenty of people RP!\n\nThat information is there for one reason or another and it\u2019s not up to my discretion to decide it\u2019s not worth reading. Not everything typed is equally important, but it has *some* level of importance if it's offered upfront without your asking.\n\nTLDR; Basically, I don\u2019t usually pre-make detailed OCs for reasons relating to free time, but that hasn\u2019t been an issue lately. So I got inspired, wrote an OC, who I feel I put a lot of effort into, and I'm starting to feel conflicted that folks who reach out to RP barely skimmed her. I get increasingly irritated and disheartened when people don't read, which makes me equally disappointed in myself for getting held up on pre-written stuff.",
