            "selftext": "So I have a lot of weird stories from my years of roleplay. Last time I shared on here, my story was more an OOC experience than in character. This one is about how this self insert Mary stu completely ruined a scene for me and my partner.\n\nI was pretty new to discord roleplay and at the time, it was pretty normal for people to just jump in wherever and whenever they wanted. I was running a server based on a popular anime and with my staff team, we didn't have a lot of restrictions on who we let in. Writing examples weren't really as big of a thing then as it is now in most servers, so of course we got people who weren't exactly the most experienced writers.\n\nThere was this girl on our server that I wanted to ban so bad but she was constantly walking on the edge of the rules, never breaking them but just being a pain in the ass about her behaviour. Me, being new to running discord rps, didn't want to come off as the rude and terrible admin who excluded people from his server simply because he didn't like them. Oh boy, how I learned the hard way that sometimes you have to.\n\nA really good partner of mine and I had a ship together with two characters from the show that we both adored. We never wanted to get smutty about it, because this was a school anime but we did want to write some sweet innocent romance. It was a huge build up with my character being a stubborn prick who didn't want to admit to his feelings for his friend and my partners character giving him space to realise that he was gay as fuck until eventually, they started making out in secret.\n\nOne day, our characters locked themselves up in their room and started making out. And then, this amazing moment happened.\n\nSo, I should mention first that this self insert girl would constantly try and write with my character because he was her favourite from the show. She was CONSTANTLY trying to god mode scenes with him when I was trying to have scenes with other people. Every time I made an open scene, she was there. Every time I replied to someone else, she was there. So of course, she was there when my character made out with his boyfriend in a locked room. \n\nHer character was in the room next to this room and could HEAR them kissing. That wasn't even the worst part. This girl started going off about how her character was SHAKING and CONFUSED because two boys were making out in the room next to hers! We tried to ignore her posts straight out, but she kept going on about how her character was freaking out. \n\nIf you've paid attention to this post, I'm a dude and I'm very pansexual myself. I make out with dudes and I'm attracted to dudes so imagine my face when this girl casually made homosexuality seem weird.\n\nOther members chimed in in the OOC chat about how it was unrealistic that her character could hear a kiss. Her character was of course blind (as every good stu is, no shade yo blind people but why is this always a thing with stu characters?) so she could hear it because of her heightened senses... Okay. What the fuck? Other members then started asking her about the homosexuality thing and this girl straight up said, \"well, it is unnatural for two boys to make out.\"\n\nThat's when I finally had it and banned her. God damn, I wished I'd done it sooner though.",

            "selftext": "Warning: this is going to be a very long winded generalized rant and is not directed at anyone in particular. I want people who read this to keep in mind that the people I have encountered that have reached out to me that are vaguely mentioned in this post are never met with scorn and yelling when they do so and I usually reply with \"I'm sorry but that just isn't what I'm looking for at the moment thank you for your interest :)\" No one ever deserves to be yelled at for simply reaching out but it can be frustrating on my end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been using Reddit to find partners to write with for a while now. It's great, I've found a couple of really great people who have restarted my love for writing and it really brings joy to my heart to have met these people and feel like I've made new friends. Sifting through all the other people is the problem.\n\nConstantly, especially in this bout of searching for another partner, I've had nothing but people who haven't read my search post. Either they are wanting romances that I said I don't want to do, they only want smut, they are underage when I specify I only want to write with people who are 18+ because I like adult content and  I don't feel comfortable having minors involved. It has been nothing but this. The ones that frustrate me the most? People who message me asking me to teach them. \n\nI've had people reach out when they see my word count and say \"I can't do that, I prefer two paragraphs a post, but you can help me write more!\" No. I'm not your English teacher. I do this for my enjoyment, this is my fantasy escape. I clawed my way up from one paragraph posts and fanfic level mary sue characters by reading and writing my own stories and taking criticism on my own stories and *listening* to that. I don't want to teach anyone. \"I'm new to this and was hoping you could help me learn\" I'm sorry but if I had to teach every person who approached me how to start from the beginning, this hobby I have for a stress relief would turn into a job and a chore. There are plenty of other people who are writing at your level or just above that would love to write with you, I've stated the level I'm looking for, please respect that. I would never reach out to someone who says they like one liner posts and expect them to change for me.\n\nI fully and completely understand that not every single post needs to be paragraphs after paragraph. Dialogue or low energy scenes can suffice with a paragraph or two, that's great. The establishment of a scene, of characters, action, and drama should be long though. There are so many ways to direct movies out of words and paint pictures in the scene and I want to see it all. I want to believe that this scene is happening and is real. \n\nI understand that not everyone *wants* to write as much as me. Not everyone wants to do the novella multi paragraphical advanced literate posts, but if that is what I state that I am looking for, why would you message me if that isn't your thing? \n\nAnd for the love of GOD read my post. Don't ask me for a smut roleplay and before even introducing yourself list off your kinks and your interests when I specify in my bullet point list that I do not want an ERP. When I specify what kind of couple I'm looking for, do not assume I'm looking for something else. If I specify I like playing MxF couples, don't assume I'm going to agree to MxM or FxF and wait until we are done planning to show me your character and I find out you wanted a couple other than what I specified I wanted to play. If I say I only want to play with adults, do not message me with ideas of a roelplay if you are a minor.  \n\nI also don't understand why people wouldn't think I wouldn't look at their reddit account before agreeing to play with them? If you say you're advanced lit and can do large paragraphs with semi-decent (cause boy or boy has spell check failed me a couple of times that's for damn sure) grammar and spelling, and I look back through your posts and find a post for a roleplay search and \"you rite like this, And dont fix any of ur mistakes' then no, I'm not going to believe you and I'm not going to agree to a game, especially not if that post is a week old, there is no way you have changed your writing that drastically that we would work together well at all. \n\nProbably the worst part is when first thing off the bat someone rants about how they were ghosted or that's what they hate most, in the first two messages of knowing someone. If I ask what your limits and triggers are for adult content so I can avoid anything that might be potentially harmful or make you uncomfortable the answer is not \"when someone ghosts me\". That wasn't the question. Ranting about your previous partners before I even get the chance to know you when you're reaching out to me about a game is like ranting about your previous Ex's on a first date. Maybe *you're* the crazy one and that's why they all bounced?   \n\n\n/end scene",

            "selftext": "Alrighty, this post is just going to be a rant about a few experiences that I have had over the years. I hope some of these give those who read it a laugh, or make you go \u2018what. the. hell.\u2019 Because she surely did that to me. \n\nSo, I have had a love of writing since I was in middle school and I am WELL into university now. I\u2019ve written short stories, won a few contests here and there, yadda yadda and a bunch of other things I no longer think about. However, I\u2019ve always had a love for role playing once I got into it as I got older. Sharing and crafting a story with another person always brought joy to my face......when they worked out. \n\n\nOne experience that actually happened fairly recently really shook me. It should be made known is that I ALWAYS play female characters who are women of color. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and it\u2019s what I\u2019m most comfortable doing when I play females. This one story I had in mind involved some touchy subjects (if you know Ruby Bridges think of a modern version of her tale) and this one...gentleman approached saying that he\u2019s been DYING to do an interracial relationship and that he loves the idea. Of course I\u2019m living for it but I quickly explain to him that some triggers involving discrimination will be in the story. \n\nHe says, \u201cthat\u2019s alright. Just as long as it\u2019s not overbearing.\u201d I assure him that I\u2019m not going to go \u2018over the top\u2019 because there is more to the story than the racial aspect. He then asks me the setting and I say modern. \nI KID YOU NOT - HE GOES. \n\n\u201cAh! So it\u2019s not the burning of crosses In your front yard and lynching type of racism. It\u2019s subtle... northern racism IS the best kind of racism.\u201d \n\n.......\n\nYeah. \n\nNow he may have said this in a joking tone but I didn\u2019t find it funny at ALL. And if that wasn\u2019t bad. He then continues to ask \u201cSo are they in a relationship or just banging? And is he proud about their banging and goes around talking about it? I think he\u2019d brag about it.\u201d At that point I just gave up. I was just getting such a bad vibe I couldn\u2019t deal anymore. \n\nAnother experience I\u2019ve had in the past wasn\u2019t one of a bad story/writer. It was clinginess and impatience. And GOD I hate sounding like this but everyone needs a little space. Writing with this person, amazing writer. Long responses, great input you name it.  But they have the patience of a spoilt child in a candy store. I will admit I haven\u2019t had the best track record of replying because sometimes Netflix catches my attention and being in university you know, you get busy. I would be talking to this person OOC, walk away from my phone for 5 MINUTES. And come back to \n\n\u201cHello\u201d\n\n\u201c????\u201d\n\n\u201cHellooooo.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back \ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I did something to upset you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI messaged them and let them know that when I dont answer it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignoring them. It\u2019s simply because I\u2019ve gotten a bit busy. They decided to reply \u201cI\u2019m needy okay? You can\u2019t leave me for too long.\u201d \n\nFinal story - and this one is the craziest of them all. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it short and sweet. \n\nBasically this girl and I were writing and she was obsessed with 5 seconds of summer. She wanted me to get a band member\u2019s contact for her and I told her I couldn\u2019t do that. She starts arguing with me saying that if I was a true friend I\u2019d help her talk to her \u201chusband\u201d and she starts whining. I then tell her she needs to stop being a fucking brat and realize that she can\u2019t get everything she wants. She then says that she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s a pain and she\u2019s gonna go kill herself. She SENDS ME PHOTOS OF HER SCARS and then goes completely fucking psycho. \nShe starts texting me as her \u201csister\u201d saying that she had been admitted into the hospital and was on life support. Dumbass. \n\n\u201cAll my sister wanted was his Kik and you couldn\u2019t even do that. Didn\u2019t you meet Justin Bieber?\u201d I was like...no the fuck? Then the girl STILL posing as her \u2018sister\u2019 got her FRIEND to POSE AS ME (even changed her contact name to my name) and say things I\u2019ve never said and then screenshotted it sent that to me as proof. Dumbass. \n\nI asked what the area code of the number was and guess what??? Wasn\u2019t even mine. When I told her that she said \u201cwell I don\u2019t fucking care. Just get the Kik so my sister can live!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry. \n\nHOW THE FUCK AM I, SOMEONE WHO DOESNT EVEN KNOW S H I T ABOUT FIVE SECONDS OF SUMMER SUPPOSED TO GET ONE OF THE MEMBERS CONTACT INFORMATION FOR YOUR TOXIC D U M B A S S. I JUST CAME HERE FOR A GOOD STORY WHICH I DIDNT EVEN GET BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING OBSESSED WITH uWu FUCKING CHARACTERS THAT OOMPA LOOMPA ASS BITCH. \n\n\nCutting this short, I gave the \u201csister\u201d my old Kik, FaceTimed that same girl who was definitely not in the hospital. Called her out on her bullshit and said she was insane for having someone pose as me because i know for a fact there are only like 7 ish people in the world with my name. To which \u201cbut...her name iS the name. ITs jUst pRonOunced diFfErEnt bc iTs hEbrew.\u201d My name IS HEBREW, you can only pronounce it one way. Dumbass. Then I blocked her number and have blocked every social media account she\u2019s made to contact me ever since. And yes, she still tries to talk to me 7years later. \n\n\nWow that was a lot but...welcome to my crazy Roleplay past!!!!",

We\u2019ve been roleplaying on and off for a few years now. Up until recently, everything has been great, good storylines, good character progression etc.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed in the past four Rp\u2019s though that she tends to write my characters out of the story. Like completely ignore anything my character will say or do. Slowly she will bring in a character she seemingly enjoys more and have them fill the spot of my character. I don\u2019t understand this, I\u2019ve even talked to her about it. If you don\u2019t like the characters I make, that\u2019s understandable but just tell me so I can adjust or figure out what you don\u2019t like. The response is always the same. \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t even realize what I did. I\u2019m so sorry! We can bring them back!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where when a new Roleplay starts, I won\u2019t make a character and instead just ask what she wants so I don\u2019t go through the hassle of making a character just for them to disappear. \n\nHow do you go about trying to get a partner to understand what they\u2019re doing? Or even communicate what\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m beginning to not enjoy writer with a partner and don\u2019t want to lose that passion you know?",

            "selftext": "So. I've been in a lot of fandom roleplays, I like them. I have played both canon characters but also OCs. So, there was this roleplayer, let's call her M, who was in a couple RPs for the same fandom with me. She made a server with the fandom's world, but we basically roleplayed as our original characters there. It was chill and fun, all good. Now, my character was M's love interest, she wanted it to be that way herself. Now, I still like to build the relationship, and my character was dealing with some shit so I didn't want them to get together instantly, I felt like that would have been boring. M never said she had a problem with that.\n\nOne night, we were roleplaying in the group, and then I had to go to bed (I was in a different time zone, so they kept on). When I checked the rp in the morning, M's character was together with another character and she was basically pretending like her character never had a crush on my character. Now, that would be fine, I wouldn't have a problem with her changing her mind. But what kinda upset me was that she didn't ask me about it, didn't even tell me about it, but just basically ignored my character's involvement. And the best thing? I was gone for like 3 hours. And she had moved onto someone else's character because she was too impatient to wait for 3 hours for me to get back, and didn't communicate with me at all. This isn't the worst thing, but it made me feel left out, made me feel like I was no longer worth her time because I didn't want our characters to get together the same day the rp started, and because I had to be gone for a few hours. I just feel like it was a little rude of her, and after that, I felt very left out in the rp. You see, I'm scared of confrontation even when online with some random people. So I only brought it up as a joke, and she got super defensive.\n\nAnd that isn't the only thing. In those three hours I was gone, they were suddenly adding some supernatural elements to the characters - something we had never plotted or discussed of before. And they didn't include me at all. I get it, of course they can make progress when I'm gone, that's just fair. But what made me realize that she, and honestly a lot of roleplayers in that group were pretty toxic was that they often left me out, and it wasn't just because of the timezone thing. They would say things like \"oh let's wait for (another roleplayer) C before we go on with the plot so they don't miss it :)\" but when I was gone for 3 hours they turned the whole thing around.\n\nLook, I would get it if she was 12 or something. But she was literally 19-20. Not a kid. After that, I left the rp. And again, before someone gets me wrong, it wasn't because she wanted to change love interests, no; I just felt left out, especially when she was one of those people who didn't give a shit about anyone else's characters except hers and her character's love interest. She also always had to make everything about her character. Her character always got into trouble, always cried, and if other characters had problems she always made them about her character. Her characters were always the same too, no matter if it was her oc or a canon character. I roleplayed in a same group with her in four groups, two of which were her playing a canon character and two were her ocs. They were all the same. You know, those I'm Baby UWU characters. I can't believe I put up with that. Maybe because I liked the other roleplayers and had become friends with them all.\n\nSorry if this makes no sense. English isn't my first language.",

            "selftext": "I am kind of new to RP, and only recently started reading about it and learning about RP etiquette. So forgive me if my question seems obvious!\n\nI responded to an ad for a 1x1 slice of life RP a few weeks ago playing as a male character. The other character is female. I am pretty picky about the characters I RP with, but this one piqued my interest. And for the most part, I wasn't disappointed: their writing is pretty good, the character is interesting ennough, and the storyline is fun.\n\nBut something that bothers me is how the player keeps trying to hammer home the point that their character is attractive, sexy, hot, etc. It's one thing to mention it a couple times, but now it's in almost every other message. A few examples of what I'm talking about:\n\n* In every setting or event, there's always a few lines about how everyone in the scene is \"drooling\" over the character\n* Creating throwaway NPCs just for a few lines of dialogue praising the character's looks\n* Constantly putting the character in tight/skimpy attire just to describe how good she looks in those outfits (even if the situation doesn't call for it)\n* Assuming that my character finds her attractive and \"keeps staring at her\"\n* Making average, everyday actions suggestive, e.g. drinking a glass of water (followed by a heavy-handed description of how sexy she looked doing it)\n\nFor reference, we did not plan much OOC before starting but agreed that neither romance nor mature themes were off the table. Still, this seems a bit much to me. Even when the characters are having serious moments it always comes back to the other character's beauty or sheer sensuality that no one in the room can resist. It's pretty distracting and jarring when it happens. Especially since it's done in a pointed way. I didn't acknowledge it through either my narration or my character's dialogue, but the descriptions have since gotten more and more frequent. \n\nI'm still learning, but I don't want to be judgmental about others' play styles. Can someone honestly tell me if I'm being too critical? And if I'm not, I would love some advice about how to communicate between players. Is this something that I should learn to live with, or is it worth trying to discuss?",

Maybe not a trend, but it's happened about three times and the specific details have all been pretty similar, so it seems like a trend.  I'd get a message replying to a roleplay prompt I posted, usually through Reddit Chat, usually from an account less than a day old.  I don't think it's like, the same person asking again and again, their RP styles have all been relatively distinct from each other, but within a few days they delete their accounts.\n\nOut of curiosity, I've checked the account pages after deleting and they don't exist for my other account either, so it's not that they blocked me.  Was just wondering if anyone else had something like that happen recently, or if anyone knows why that would happen?",

I hope some of these give those who read it a laugh, or make you go \u2018what. the. hell.\u2019 Because she surely did that to me. \n\nSo, I have had a love of writing since I was in middle school and I am WELL into university now. I\u2019ve written short stories, won a few contests here and there, yadda yadda and a bunch of other things I no longer think about. However, I\u2019ve always had a love for role playing once I got into it as I got older. Sharing and crafting a story with another person always brought joy to my face......when they worked out. \n\n\nOne experience that actually happened fairly recently really shook me. It should be made known is that I ALWAYS play female characters who are women of color. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and it\u2019s what I\u2019m most comfortable doing when I play females. This one story I had in mind involved some touchy subjects (if you know Ruby Bridges think of a modern version of her tale) and this one...gentleman approached saying that he\u2019s been DYING to do an interracial relationship and that he loves the idea. Of course I\u2019m living for it but I quickly explain to him that some triggers involving discrimination will be in the story. \n\nHe says, \u201cthat\u2019s alright. Just as long as it\u2019s not overbearing.\u201d I assure him that I\u2019m not going to go \u2018over the top\u2019 because there is more to the story than the racial aspect. He then asks me the setting and I say modern. \nI KID YOU NOT - HE GOES. \n\n\u201cAh! So it\u2019s not the burning of crosses In your front yard and lynching type of racism. It\u2019s subtle... northern racism IS the best kind of racism.\u201d \n\n.......\n\nYeah. \n\nNow he may have said this in a joking tone but I didn\u2019t find it funny at ALL. And if that wasn\u2019t bad. He then continues to ask \u201cSo are they in a relationship or just banging? And is he proud about their banging and goes around talking about it? I think he\u2019d brag about it.\u201d At that point I just gave up. I was just getting such a bad vibe I couldn\u2019t deal anymore. \n\nAnother experience I\u2019ve had in the past wasn\u2019t one of a bad story/writer. It was clinginess and impatience. And GOD I hate sounding like this but everyone needs a little space. Writing with this person, amazing writer. Long responses, great input you name it.  But they have the patience of a spoilt child in a candy store. I will admit I haven\u2019t had the best track record of replying because sometimes Netflix catches my attention and being in university you know, you get busy. I would be talking to this person OOC, walk away from my phone for 5 MINUTES. And come back to \n\n\u201cHello\u201d\n\n\u201c????\u201d\n\n\u201cHellooooo.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back \ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I did something to upset you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI messaged them and let them know that when I dont answer it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignoring them. It\u2019s simply because I\u2019ve gotten a bit busy. They decided to reply \u201cI\u2019m needy okay? You can\u2019t leave me for too long.\u201d \n\nFinally story - and this one is the craziest of them all. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it short and sweet. \n\nBasically this girl and I were writing and she was obsessed with 5 seconds of summer. She wanted me to get a band members contact for her and I told her I couldn\u2019t do that. She starts arguing with me saying that if I was a true friend I\u2019d help her talk to her \u201chusband\u201d and she starts whining. I then tell her she needs to stop being a brat and realize that she can\u2019t get everything she wants. She then says that she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s a pain and she\u2019s gonna go kill herself. She SENDS ME PHOTOS OF HER SCARS and then goes completely psycho. \nShe starts texting me as her \u201csister\u201d saying that she had been admitted into the hospital and was on life support. \n\n\u201cAll my sister wanted was his Kik and you couldn\u2019t even do that. Didn\u2019t you meet Justin Bieber?\u201d I was like...no. Then the girl still posing as her sister got her FRIEND to POSE AS ME (even changed her contact name to my name) and say things I\u2019ve never said and then sent that to me as proof. I asked what the area code of the number was she guess what??? Wasn\u2019t even mine. When I told her that she said \u201cwell I don\u2019t f*cking care. Just get the Kik so my sister can live!\u201d \nCutting this short, I have the \u201csister\u201d my old Kik, FaceTimed the girl who was definitely not in the hospital. Called her out on her stupidness, blocked her number and have blocked every social media account she\u2019s made to contact me ever since. \n\n\nWow that was a lot but...welcome to my crazy Roleplay past!!!!",

You can\u2019t leave me for too long.\u201d \n\nFinal story - and this one is the craziest of them all. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it short and sweet. \n\nBasically this girl and I were writing and she was obsessed with 5 seconds of summer. She wanted me to get a band members contact for her and I told her I couldn\u2019t do that. She starts arguing with me saying that if I was a true friend I\u2019d help her talk to her \u201chusband\u201d and she starts whining. I then tell her she needs to stop being a brat and realize that she can\u2019t get everything she wants. She then says that she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s a pain and she\u2019s gonna go kill herself. She SENDS ME PHOTOS OF HER SCARS and then goes completely psycho. \nShe starts texting me as her \u201csister\u201d saying that she had been admitted into the hospital and was on life support. \n\n\u201cAll my sister wanted was his Kik and you couldn\u2019t even do that. Didn\u2019t you meet Justin Bieber?\u201d I was like...no. Then the girl still posing as her sister got her FRIEND to POSE AS ME (even changed her contact name to my name) and say things I\u2019ve never said and then sent that to me as proof. I asked what the area code of the number was she guess what??? Wasn\u2019t even mine. When I told her that she said \u201cwell I don\u2019t f*cking care. Just get the Kik so my sister can live!\u201d \nCutting this short, I gave the \u201csister\u201d my old Kik, FaceTimed the girl who was definitely not in the hospital. Called her out on her stupidness, blocked her number and have blocked every social media account she\u2019s made to contact me ever since. \n\n\nWow that was a lot but...welcome to my crazy Roleplay past!!!!",

            "selftext": "So Roleplaying is hard. It\u2019s difficult to make a character that you like, and preferably a character that no one else wants to kill in the middle of the night and burn the corpse. Nowhere is this more painfully obvious than on Roblox. If you do any of these, I\u2019m asking that you please refrain from doing it in the future. I\u2019m also getting all of the awful stories out of my system so I can type in new ones as they come. \n\nFANTASY SERVERS\n1. Cat person on a kingdom server wants nothing to do with fighting the ENORMOUS FUCK YOU DRAGON in front of him, and would rather get in other peoples\u2019 way and sell fruit that the game literally doesn\u2019t allow him to give to others, never mind the lack of currency. Because \u201cLol So RANDOM XD\u201d humor isn\u2019t dead enough yet. \n\n2. When demons, especially Satan, have children, you\u2019d expect them to look kinda demonic. Nope. They look like normal humans, apparently. Don\u2019t worry, though! You can always tell which people are children of demons because they\u2019ll dress in black and brood all the time. Also they\u2019re everywhere. And shockingly, not as ostracized or hated as you\u2019d expect. \n\n3. Don\u2019t go into the throne room unless your computer can handle the lag spike. There\u2019s bound to be approximately 837 people in there at once. Some are plotting a coup, some are in the middle of a coup, some are asking the royalty questions, and some are just there because there\u2019s nothing better to do. Also, nobody is anywhere else. If you tend to loiter in the throne room, for the gods\u2019 sake, MOVE ELSEWHERE!!\n\n4. Insane characters. Just don\u2019t. Or if you must, don\u2019t have the character be like \u201cI STAB YOU IN THE CHEST AND NO YOU CANT BLOCK BECAUSE IM CRAZY AND NOW YOURE DEAD!!!\u201d No one likes that. No one. Actually research their mental illness. Take a gander at the symptoms. Are there any themes that you want to get across by having your character belong in the loony bin? How did they get to be where they are? \n\nHIGH SCHOOL/TOWN LIFE SERVERS\n1. Satan\u2019s children are brooding here, too. Luckily, the signs for spotting one are basically the same. \n\n2. Adults will try to force you to be their daughter/son by running up behind you and letting the game\u2019s physics force you into the little stroller thing most games give you. If that\u2019s your thing, great. If not, that sucks, because they will not leave you alone, and you\u2019ll have to join a new server. If you do this, just go to the adoption center that\u2019s always open like a normal person. \n\n3. Babies will try to force you to be their mother/father by sitting themselves in the middle of the road and saying \u201cgoo goo gah gah\u201d. If that\u2019s you\u2019re thing, great. If not, that sucks, because they will *follow you to your house.* If you do this, just go to the adoption center that\u2019s always open like a normal person. \n\n4. It\u2019s pretty obvious to most people that High School Life RPs contain very few actual high-school-age players. Most servers contain at least one person who spots a cute character and opens a conversation with *Rapes Cute Female Player*. \n\nAgain, if you do these things, please stop doing these things. I personally dislike them, and I know quite a few others who feel the same.",

So I'll try and list them out and they won't be in order.\n\nHis character, a magic school teacher' magically aged up my 6 year old character, a student of his at his magic school server, to an adult for some sort of witch power ritual, and asked me in my DMs if I could have her enjoy rubbing 'magical oil' over her naked body.\n\nYou heard that correctly. He wanted to make my character, with the mentality of a child still, to enjoy her teacher fondling her. I should have left right then honestly, but we have so much more to tell about.\n\nOne of his stupid friends, that he clearly shows favoritism towards, initiated a school shooting at what was supposed to be a kindergarten graduation event, and all he did was sit and laugh until I cussed him and his friend out on main. Such a thing should have gotten that friend banned, but no, he was muted for 20 minutes.\n\nHe kept coming to people for 'help' managing server and just dumps all the harder tasks on them before he fucks around with the Giveaway bot, and that bot he would put so much random fandom shit in there that didn't make sense. Think stuff from Ben10, Naruto, DBZ, Rick and Morty, and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nHe would literally make random server locations and put his character there and say on main that he was taking a 'vacation', then RP relaxing on an island.\n\nHe had at least a few alts running around in server and would use them to talk to himself. He would literally have a full conversation with himself and also use the alts to 'agree' with him on ideas.\n\nI eventually left because he was a whole aneurysm.\n\nAfter a while, I got a random link with no context from someone I didn't recognize in my DMs about a Naruto server. I figured it was an old friend/RP buddy from another server, since I'm un and out of them a lot and figured they changed their PFP and name.\n\nClicked the link and it was him and one of his alts. And, like he normally does, he has his characters as Roblox characters and everyone else is being cringey and toxic. I tried to give him a second chance but one of his friends thought playing a 'villain' character meant he could kill or maim other people's characters without permission. And he condoned it. Yet again, I left.\n\nSame thing happened about a year later. Random link to a medieval server, I go in, it's the same group and I was bored and gave him one last chance. He asked if I wanted to play queen of the rival kingdom and inwas like, sure, and went about my day. Got a bunch of pings and YOUR MAJESTY *bowing down* comments on the main chat and was just thoroughly done.\n\nSo, yeah, I hope I never meet him or his alts ever again.",

            "selftext": "\nFirst actual Post so bear with me:\n\nI've been rp-ing for 10 or so years so I've dealt with a lot but recently my writing partner has been irritating me.\n\nNow we have a pretty unique system; we're both very versatile and have a lot of the same interests so we end up doubling often and playing quite a few characters in any given rp.\n\nIt's usually pretty fast paced and fun but their characters have started to really annoy me, so I figured I'd tell you about one of our Rps or a particular character per post. (Since I definitely won't run out of material any time soon). \n\nWe'll start with \"Cat\" cos he's one of the 3-4 most bullshit ones I've had to deal with recently. \n\nSo in this universe some people have powers, as as a general rule the earlier your powers come in the more powerful you are. There are also \"physical\" powers which tend to be things like horns or fur. People with physical powers tend to develop a \"secondary\" power with the physical ones showing up first. \n\nCat was born with fur. Cat fur, with ears and a tail (the powers are not unusual for this universe, its more the fact he was born with them). He was able to turn into a cat before he was 5, he took a long time to open his eyes (like a cat) and could walk around and do most things before he even started talking.\n\nHe has the power to stop people being able to lie in a given radius around him, to cancel powers, to boost powers and more that he hasn't even discovered yet. He has to constantly snack on sweets to stock up on calories so he can keep his powers in check because he can't control his powers so he just uses his cancelling power to cancel them all out which uses a lot of energy. (I probably described that terribly but it's hard to describe). \n\nHe doesn't need to cancel out powers he can control so he can turn fluffy or into a cat at will. \n\nHe isn't really aware of the boosting power, but in order to use the truth power he just stops eating sweets for a while and eventually it kicks in on it's own. \n\nAlso Cat's incredibly hot, but doesn't think he is. And ridiculously smart, specialising in biology. He's incredibly fast and strong too, with reflexes so good he can react to unexpected gunshots without a scratch. \n\nPowers in this universe, whilst relatively common, are still a big deal. Not terribly much is known about them and being born with powers is a rarity. Having more then 3 powers is so rare that there are less then 5 people known to posses that many (and none of them are Cat cos the government doesn't know about that) so his entire situation is kind of a big deal. \n\nFor comparison, my character (who's for all intents and purposes Cats counterpart since they're gonna get together and all that) has the ability to sense others heartbeats and sync them to his own or sync his to theirs. Like we toyed with the idea that he can do more and just doesn't know yet, but even still it would never reach the level of bull that is Cat. \n\nNow I have 1 character in this universe who is insanely powerful (because why not, op characters are fun). But the distinction here is, whilst my character is powerful, his powers are such that they aren't used (majorly at least) in his everyday life nor really for the plot - which is another important point: he very much exists outside the main plot. He lends dialogue and occasionally a point of conflict, but nothing that puts him in a situation where he can just use his powers to bullshit his way through. \n\nCat is a main driver in the plot and his powers are extremely useful to the plot to the point of being irritating. \n\nThere's a whole government conspiracy thing going on (that I would love to gush about but that really isn't the point of this post) and Cat's powers make it easy for him to obtain information.\n\nNeed to question someone? Just stop eating sweets so everyone has to tell the truth. \nThat won't work? Turn into a cat and get close enough that you can hear them with your superb hearing. \nAre you somewhere you shouldn't be? Well you won't get killed cos of your amazing senses and reaction time so just keep going.\n\nAs the one who plans out most the plots and introduces most the key points it gets extremely tiring trying to think up scenarios that make it hard for my WP to just skip over without much hassle. \n\nSo yeah, that's Cat. I probably missed some stuff, but like I'm pretty sure you have a good idea of how annoying he is. \n\nI'll probably come and tell you about another one soon, so like watch this space.",

            "selftext": "Alrighty, this post is just going to be a rant about a few experiences that I have had over the years. I hope some of these give those who read it a laugh, or make you go \u2018what. the. hell.\u2019 Because she surely did that to me. \n\nSo, I have had a love of writing since I was in middle school and I am WELL into university now. I\u2019ve written short stories, won a few contests here and there, yadda yadda and a bunch of other things I no longer think about. However, I\u2019ve always had a love for role playing once I got into it as I got older. Sharing and crafting a story with another person always brought joy to my face......when they worked out. \n\n\nOne experience that actually happened fairly recently really shook me. It should be made known is that I ALWAYS play female characters who are women of color. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and it\u2019s what I\u2019m most comfortable doing when I play females. This one story I had in mind involved some touchy subjects (if you know Ruby Bridges think of a modern version of her tale) and this one...gentleman approached saying that he\u2019s been DYING to do an interracial relationship and that he loves the idea. Of course I\u2019m living for it but I quickly explain to him that some triggers involving discrimination will be in the story. \n\nHe says, \u201cthat\u2019s alright. Just as long as it\u2019s not overbearing.\u201d I assure him that I\u2019m not going to go \u2018over the top\u2019 because there is more to the story than the racial aspect. He then asks me the setting and I say modern. \nI KID YOU NOT - HE GOES. \n\n\u201cAh! So it\u2019s not the burning of crosses In your front yard and lynching type of racism. It\u2019s subtle... northern racism IS the best kind of racism.\u201d \n\n.......\n\nYeah. \n\nNow he may have said this in a joking tone but I didn\u2019t find it funny at ALL. And if that wasn\u2019t bad. He then continues to ask \u201cSo are they in a relationship or just banging? And is he proud about their banging and goes around talking about it? I think he\u2019d brag about it.\u201d At that point I just gave up. I was just getting such a bad vibe I couldn\u2019t deal anymore. \n\nAnother experience I\u2019ve had in the past wasn\u2019t one of a bad story/writer. It was clinginess and impatience. And GOD I hate sounding like this but everyone needs a little space. Writing with this person, amazing writer. Long responses, great input you name it.  But they have the patience of a spoilt child in a candy store. I will admit I haven\u2019t had the best track record of replying because sometimes Netflix catches my attention and being in university you know, you get busy. I would be talking to this person OOC, walk away from my phone for 5 MINUTES. And come back to \n\n\u201cHello\u201d\n\n\u201c????\u201d\n\n\u201cHellooooo.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back \ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I did something to upset you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI messaged them and let them know that when I dont answer it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignoring them. It\u2019s simply because I\u2019ve gotten a bit busy. They decided to reply \u201cI\u2019m needy okay? You can\u2019t leave me for too long.\u201d \n\nFinal story - and this one is the craziest of them all. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it short and sweet. \n\nBasically this girl and I were writing and she was obsessed with 5 seconds of summer. She wanted me to get a band member\u2019s contact for her and I told her I couldn\u2019t do that. She starts arguing with me saying that if I was a true friend I\u2019d help her talk to her \u201chusband\u201d and she starts whining. I then tell her she needs to stop being a fucking brat and realize that she can\u2019t get everything she wants. She then says that she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s a pain and she\u2019s gonna go kill herself. She SENDS ME PHOTOS OF HER SCARS and then goes completely fucking psycho. \nShe starts texting me as her \u201csister\u201d saying that she had been admitted into the hospital and was on life support. Dumbass. \n\n\u201cAll my sister wanted was his Kik and you couldn\u2019t even do that. Didn\u2019t you meet Justin Bieber?\u201d I was like...no the fuck? Then the girl STILL posing as her \u2018sister\u2019 got her FRIEND to POSE AS ME (even changed her contact name to my name) and say things I\u2019ve never said and then screenshotted it sent that to me as proof. Dumbass. \n\nI asked what the area code of the number was and guess what??? Wasn\u2019t even mine. When I told her that she said \u201cwell I don\u2019t fucking care. Just get the Kik so my sister can live!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry. \n\nHOW THE FUCK AM I, SOMEONE WHO DOESNT EVEN KNOW S H I T ABOUT FIVE SECONDS OF SUMMER SUPPOSED TO GET ONE OF THE MEMBERS CONTACT INFORMATION FOR YOUR TOXIC D U M B A S S. I JUST CAME HERE FOR A GOOD STORY WHICH I DIDNT EVEN GET BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING OBSESSED WITH uWu FUCKING CHARACTERS THAT OOMPA LOOMPA ASS BITCH. \n\n\nCutting this short, I gave the \u201csister\u201d my old Kik, FaceTimed that same girl who was definitely not in the hospital. Called her out on her bullshit and said she was insane for having someone pose as me because i know for a fact there are only like 7 ish people in the world with my name. To which she said \u201cbut...her name iS the same. ITs jUst pRonOunced diFfErEnt bc iTs hEbrew.\u201d My name IS HEBREW, you can only pronounce it one way. Dumbass. Then I blocked her number and have blocked every social media account she\u2019s made to contact me ever since. And yes, she still tries to talk to me 7years later. \n\n\nWow that was a lot but...welcome to my crazy Roleplay past!!!!",

So, this is my first post on this subreddit- but damn, do I have a story for you.  \n\n\nSo, I have been rping for about 5-6 years now, and I have a TON of bad stories out of it. However, this one had stuck with me even though it probably happened around... 2 years ago I'd say. And I believe this is the story that I remember like, all the details on, so I'll probably be the best telling this one.   \n\n\n(Nothing really graphic in this story- however, I marked it NSFW just because of the mention of fetishes later on in the story-)  \n\n\nSo, let's get into the story- might be a long one.. yet, it is totally worth it in my opinion. But first, let me tell you a little bit of background... and oh, it really just makes it worst...  \n\n\nSo basically, I met this guy (who I'll just refer to as 'S') well- In like, kindergarten. We definitely had a lot in common, even at such a young age, we liked drawing, making little characters, and we'd always I guess 'play pretend' out on the playground. And really, that probably started our character making/story writing hobbies when I really think about it. I'd say me and this dude were good friends until... after 5th grade, because the dude moved away and stopped going to my school after that. And well, we lost contact- and it wasn't until many MANY years later when I had spoken to another one of our mutual friends from that school and this dude gave me S's Discord so we can talk again. And of course, as somebody who enjoys reconnecting with old friends, I sent him a friend request and we started talking again.  \n\n\nNow- into the rp stuff. So after talking to S for maybe about a night, we somehow got onto the topic of roleplaying- and that evolved into wanting to do one. Of course, I love to rp, and S was my friend so... sure! What could go wrong? I was dying for a pretty decent rp, I was all for it. But oh... I was so so wrong.  \n\n\nSo we were discussing of course basically what we wanted to do... settled on some kind of modern, city setting we will have our characters in and that was settled. Discussing our characters comes next. So, I ask S if he had a character he wanted to use- he said yes, but wanted me to tell him about mine first. I agreed. I decided to use my two characters, Serj and Daron, for this particular rp. Gave him all my info for them, my art of them, and this is the most important part because it will come in handy later- I even told him that Serj and Daron were in a happy relationship, asked if he was cool with it. S said of course, he didn't mind.   \n\n\nNow... here comes S's character. He told me the character's name was.... \\*drumroll\\* *Surge.*.. yes, you heard me right, his character was literally named ***Surge***. Now, doesn't that name sound AWFULLY familiar? Oh yeah, definitely. As soon as he told me the name of the character, I knew for *certain* this dude copied the name of my character, Serj- because his character didn't *have* one... because he made him up on the spot (which I don't understand why he would lie about having one and then do so, I would've been happy to help him make one), however... I don't really know... why? Like what is the point in doing that? Now that I think about it, he probably did it to impress me (he did this a LOT). But Surge's name wasn't the only thing bad about him, but also, he had literally *every single* power of *every single* video game character S could think of. Ya know, he's got the powers of Mario, Sonic, Link, Kirby, he could literally pull mushrooms and fire flowers out of nowhere and solve ANY issue doing so. That was a little... overpowered, and I hope you could agree? Really, the one thing I enjoyed about this character was how he was a scientist and had a lab but... S really never went anywhere with it. Oh yeah- did I forget to mention that Surge was also an inter-dimensional god? Well- he was.   \n\n\nSo- then the rp started. Everything was all good, Serj and Daron met Surge, they became closer over time (Serj *always* found it quite strange how Surge had the same name as him, just spelt differently), and all was fine and dandy. The 3 then grew close enough to move in with one another and they did- they all lived in a 2 bedroom apartment, there was nothing wrong with it. But then... it went wrong. Serj and Daron are dating like I mentioned earlier, right? Well Surge over here had the hots for Daron, and oh, he didn't hide it. Dunno what made him choose Daron but... I guess this dude was really just smokin' hot to Surge or something. He likes bad boys?  \n\n\nThis- is Daron:  \n\n\n[oh yeah baby \\(art by me!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9mqqfezj18051.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4496d664c7affc06d277ad464b5767a4553c01f0)\n\nNow, because Surge had the hots for Daron- that caused Surge to of course- try and get Daron alone so he can try and get into Daron's pants? Or at least try and hit on him. Now... Surge would make up excuses to why Serj should leave the house (ONLY him), he would take Daron away from the group when they were in public and leave Serj just standing there alone, etc. And Daron was always kinda oblivious to all this because well 1) Daron is kinda low-key dumb and 2) Daron was already dating Serj so why would he think somebody would hit on him? and 3) Daron would sort of think it was a joke or something. Besides, Daron would obviously *tell* Surge that the flirting and all that wasn't really cool- and oh... that didn't stop Surge at all, no way.  \n\n\nSo, Surge always had sort of something against Surge which I also have no idea why he would but- hell, Serj was getting in the way of *claiming his man* so... I dunno, but otherwise, Serj of course treated Surge kindly because he is a overall good dude, and most of the time he was unaware of why Surge would always try and get alone with Daron. Serj also was oblivious- and he was also a people pleaser, so most of the time he'd do what others asked.   \n\n\nThis- is Serj\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oh Yeah Baby Pt 2 \\(Art once again by me!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/pq935j8y38051.png?width=421&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8ffe59b347c1d306b4a850558ce9435eb665964)\n\nNow... then the ***incident*** happened. The 3 went to a beach/boardwalk, and you know, they were doing their thing- until once again, Surge tried to get Daron away from Serj to 'tell him something'. Now, Daron this time sort of refused because well... they were standing in the middle of some kind of crowded beach and he didn't want to just leave Serj there all alone where hell, they may not even find the man again. So Surge was like 'whatever' and went to tell Daron what he had to say anyways... which, wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't SURGE'S LOVE CONFESSION TO DARON- RIGHT IN FRONT OF SERJ, TOO! And of course, Daron straight up refused and straight up went all nasty at Surge because *he was standing in the middle of the beach with his boyfriend and other friend and that same friend confessed his love dramatically to him in front of that said boyfriend and of* ***course*** *that would anger any normal person especially when he told him off for flirting and everything else before.* And also understandably- Serj was VERY pissed off about this. And then oh- it got WORST and NOO-!  \n\n\nThere's a whole other ass layer of 'oh my god whyyy' on top of this. S apparently... had some kind of tickle/foot fetish? Now- I would originally not care, you're into what you're into- however, I really do care once you start to push it on me without my consent- because it makes me *super* uncomfortable (and he didn't just do this in rp- but ooc as well). But of course... he couldn't just be *normal* with it. Back to the story-  \n\n\nSo now Daron had rejected Surge, Serj was still very upset with Surge- you would think that would make Surge realize 'oh shit this isn't good', right? NO! Then Surge proceeded to practically beg on his knees to.... no- not for Daron to love him over Serj but to... let Surge... suck/tickle his feet because... they're cute? At that point Daron said ***\"hell to the fucking no what is wrong with you?\"*** and- they all left the beach that day- fun times were ruined...  \n\n\nAnd lastly... the worst part. So, Daron and Serj obviously were upset about it for a while, and they tried to keep some space between themselves and Surge. Of course they still lived together, so they were friendly when they had to speak- but overall, there was definitely a lot of tension and awkwardness between these characters. They didn't quite want to kick Surge out because Surge agreed to calm down and back off- and it seemed to be okay. Until one night Surge just couldn't handle his urges and came into Daron and Serj's room to- oh my god fuck no- to suck not just Daron's feet but... both Daron AND ALSO NOW Serj's feet- of course they woke up and literally felt so violated- that's when they told Surge he should move out.  \n\n\nAnd thank God- that was the end of the horror.  \n\n\nSorry for this story being so long- I just wanted to get it out there and hopefully you enjoy and feel my pain- and hopefully it wasn't a waste of your time! I do have more stories- so hopefully I'll get around to telling them in the future! Thanks for reading!",

What\u2019s up?\u201d L greeted, he hopped off the old teacher\u2019s desk and approached his classmate, who seemed to have finished cleaning the hallways. Don\u2019t just scare us like that, you could have at least knocked on the door\u201d M complained, she stopped re-arranging the desks and turned all her attention towards F before repeated the dangers of entering without knocking. As the two had their conversation L noticed a shoe stuck under the cabinet. How long has that thing been there? He retrieved it and put the sneaker down on a table; \u201cHey, what should we do with this?\u201d L asked, M turned around immediately, but took a while to respond; \u201cI think we could use it as a distraction, just saw some of those \u2018people\u2019 look for stuff to hold, like phones and books,\u201d. Merely seconds after she finished, a faint bang echoed trough the hallway, \u201cF, get the spear ready,\u201d L ordered as he reached for one of the makeshift spears himself and M quickly followed, \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of them, but it could also be K who forgot her phone,\u201d \n\nPartner: we kill 4 zombies and go back\n\nAnyone else? :(",
