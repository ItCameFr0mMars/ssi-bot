            "selftext": "I'll admit that I write a lot. I don't consider myself novella but easily go to around nine paragraphs. I personally don't believe that my writing is full of useless crap, I just really like to show the emotions of my characters. I love describing the surroundings and how it makes my character feel. I write as if I am right there in that scene experiencing it for myself. Now I consider myself pretty flexible, I don't expect my partners to write nine paragraphs. I usually ask that people can write at least two when responding to me just because I lose interest too quickly with short posts.\n\nI'm the type of person who likes to create worlds around my stories. I'll take time to create maps, find reference pictures, make character collages, hell, I even make up religions sometimes. I treat my roleplays like books or movies, but I found that not a lot of people feel the same. I know people get busy, I'm not the pushy type, you need time to put your stuff in order than go for it. I'm not in a rush, in fact I love taking my time. Yet 70% of people who contact me for rp want to reuse characters from old stories they did with backgrounds so specific it's impossible.\n\nI say I want to discover our characters throughout the rp and not send a oc bio right after we figure out a plot. Where's the fun in knowing everything that's gonna happen? It feels like everyone is always in a rush or just could care less about the depth of the world and characters. All they want is angsty romance or * uwu touches your d*** * .  Please tell me there are still some in depth world builders out there that care about character development and lore.",

            "selftext": "So, I play a massive, mildly popular Rp game based on the book series \u201cWarriors\u201d by Erin Hunter, where there are clans and cats in those clans. The game has a lot of rules, such as you have to be a cat, and you can only have certain names.\n\nWhat happens most the time is people play, don\u2019t read the rules, and don\u2019t follow the name rules, so for example, their name might be Maya, and they\u2019ll be asked to change it to something like Storm\u2019 Tail, easy enough, right? Nope, half the time they argue and such, and we end up having to kick them.\n\nMy worst experience was with someone named Cocoa\u2019 paw, cocoa wasn\u2019t on the list, so I asked them to change it, they didn\u2019t, and people started telling me to leave them alone. Then I told them I\u2019m going to kick them, whole bunch of people got mad at me again, so I gathered a few people and kicked the person.\n\nJust curious, am I the jerk in this situation, or is it the others for getting mad at me for following the rules?",

            "selftext": "This might just be me being a judgmental dick, but it's seriously beginning to irritate me and I needed a place to vent. This is a throwaway on the off chance she putts around on these discussion boards.\n\nI've been trying to find my footing in a small Discord group, in which there's one writer in particular who makes only female characters with \"fat tiddies\" (this is a direct quote, not me being cute). While I don't care if other people write it, I don't like writing smut - I'm asexual and just ... don't really get anything out of detailed sex scenes, you know? Anyway, I know that that sometimes doesn't jive well with others, and so I wasn't sure that she and I were going to get along.\n\nAfter talking with her, she said that she didn't actually like smut either. Great, I thought! I introduced her to my two male characters, and ships were discussed. Both of my boys are romantically and sexually interested in females, but with the understanding that any sex will happen \"off screen,\" if you will. Everything seemed fine.\n\nRight away, her interest seemed minimal. She would write only a single line, and I was frequently confused as to whether or not one character was serious when she frequently said \"I hate you\" to mine. Now, to be fair, that particular guy is incorrigible and *supposed* to be somewhat annoying. But considering how frequently this writer would complain about her other partners to me and literally *show* me examples of her IC/OOC bleeding to confront the problem, I started to suspect that was what was happening here, too.\n\nI tried with my other character, hoping maybe it would go smoother - it did not. This other boy is a lot less charismatic/flirtatious, and so the interactions fizzled almost as soon as they started. Again with the one-liners, though we thankfully went without the declarations of hatred. Frankly, I stopped pursuing any writing with her. It just wasn't fun - for either of us, I thought.\n\nAll of this on it's own, while frustrating, would not warrant a post like this for me. What put it over the edge for me was two nights ago, when I stayed up until 2am consoling her as she broke down because \"everyone only ever wants to smut for me\" and \"I feel like that's all I'm good for.\" I genuinely don't think that's the case (which I told her), just that she doesn't put much effort into her non-sexual writing (which I didn't tell her - not the time).\n\nI thought maybe things would change.\n\nThey did not. Today, she asked me my opinion on her new OC - a self-described \"bimbo scientist,\" complete with art with her in a 'sexy' pose, and the suggestion to name her \"Bambi.\" Considering how upset she was the night before, I honestly thought it was a joke?\n\nAnyway. I'm not sure how someone goes through life with such a glaring lack of self-awareness.",

            "selftext": "This was from a group rp awhile back but it\u2019s one of those things that forever sort of baffles me. \n\nMe and a pal were in a group and two of our characters really hit it off, chemistry wise. They both kind of fell into that \u201cpreviously non committal but ready to settle down type\u201d. One thing that really worked with them is they had super awesome communication! They established early on that communication was the only way we were gone make it. \n\nMe and this pal had a pretty good balance of pre planned plots and sometime just going with the flow.\n\nWell one day my pal\u2019s character drops the bomb on my character that they cheated. Admittedly, I\u2019d probably prefer a heads up OOC about such an abrupt and intense plot, but that\u2019s okay. So I had my character react in time.\n\nClearly my character was mad. She called off their relationship, wanted time to think, etc.\n\nWell then, my RP partner got mad because my character had no interest in forgiving their ex. I had explained that due to my characters own past along with the circumstances, it didn\u2019t make sense she\u2019d immediately forgive them. I was candid and said, I don\u2019t see her reasonably forgiving her any time soon.\n\nTo me, I enjoyed the drama, it was a group rp and I\u2019m ready to go with the flow. That flow involved my character sleeping with someone else. It was an organic plot within the group, as the characters always had a tiny bit of a flirt thing going on.\n\nWell my pal FLIPPED! Apparently I should have told her ahead of time because my character not forgiving hers and moving on was not her intention. She did not get why my character wouldn\u2019t forgive hers despite me explaining my characters headspace multiple times. \n\nI was admittedly confused! I got no heads up about the cheating but was willing to go with the flow but my pal did not allow me the same. \n\nI got put out as a bad guy when really, I was just having my character act organically.\n\nThe RP disbanded shortly after for unrelated issues but this still stays with me.",

It's literally just a preference???? Found from past experiences at that. \n\nYeah, I get that there are some good, decent guys to RP with but thanks to *my* shitty luck, I somehow found (or get found by) complete screwballs.\n\nYet, it's perfectly fine for a male RPer to request to only want female partners.

Sorry for the long rant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI participate in an online role playing group with a variety of individuals who fall over the gender and sexuality spectrum, and I'm fine with that. This is only important because the person involved other than myself is NB (non-binary for those who do not know) - we can call them... Chris for purposes of gender neutrality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the tea - Chris is NB, allegedly 18 (though I suspect much younger, but the server was an 18+ server so they would have been removed if they were underage), a high school senior (redflag #1), and a bit of a train wreck (redflag #2, but also, understandable - aren't we all trainwrecks as kids?). They were a constant source of drama within the server, not because they caused interpersonal issues with the other players, but rather because they would bring their personal drama from the real world into the server. Any time the conversation steered away from their interests, there would be a sudden influx of posts about how far behind they are in their posts, how far behind they are in their school work, how their mother is an (slur), how their father's gf is a bitch, how their brother's gf was rude to them. There were all these interpersonal issues (which I now see as all occurring with women), all of which were the reason they \"couldn't\" do something. (ie they couldn't get their ID, which they haven't had for the last 18 months (redflag #3) because they have a restraining order against their mother, but they can't ask their brother to get it because bro's gf won't let him to talk to them). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of story happens just about every other day. I know I'm not the only person who has commented on this - even the mods have made mention that it is \"annoying\" when Chris will derail any conversation that isn't about them, and requires near constant support/encouragement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not asking for advice - I just needed to vent.",

            "selftext": "This isn't a huge thing, I'm not angry, I just want to make sure something I've always viewed as being one of those Cardinal rules of roleplay, something that can't be broken, is actually... Well... An important rule.   \n\n\nThe Jist of it is, the more exclusive characters you play, compared to everyone else, the more responsibility you have to the social dynamic of the plot and making sure everyone remains involved.   \n\n\nFor example. Let's say there are 6 characters in a plot. If each player has 3 characters, then the social responsibility of the plot is balanced. Any failure for the two players to have a cohesive plot where their characters all get a decent amount of spotlight is evenly distributed.  \n\n\nIf you have those same six character, but 5 are being played by one player, and the other has their solitary character, the first player with 5 characters has a significant amount of responsibility to make sure their post isn't fluffed out with them talking among themselves.   \n\n\nThis increase in responsibility directly comes from the fact that the more players you have control of, the easier it is for you to just talk to yourself and completely cut out the other player leaving them trying to interact but getting forgotten cause you're so busy playing all your characters.  \n\n\nAm I being crazy or like, is this something that should be dealt with? I had a reasonable conversation with a player about this, but they didn't realize this was a thing so I want to be sure I'm not imposing my rules on them and thinking they should be able to read my mind.",

            "selftext": "This happened a few years ago, back when I didn\u2019t have much RP experience, especially with more \u2018serious\u2019 long-term stuff. Sorry in advance for the long post and for any mistakes.\n\nThe RP was mostly just slice of life and there were three characters involved. Let\u2019s call them Ava (the character I was playing), Jenna and Kyle. All canon characters from a certain movie in which the three of them are best friends. \n\nI couldn\u2019t find any active RPers for the fandom on the website I\u2019d been using, so I thought I\u2019d try my luck in another one. The main difference between the two was that in this new website I was trying out, there was little to no OOC talk and most people wouldn\u2019t plot, they\u2019d just randomly send each other starters and go from there. Not what I was used to, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a problem. What some people *did* do was make a little intro post with their RP preferences, any specific plots or ships they had in mind, etc.\n\nAnyway, I made an account for Ava and one of the first people to add me was a Kyle account. He sent me a starter not long after, which was basically just them hanging out and being friends like in the movie. Let\u2019s just say he was amazing. His writing in general was great, and he was always so perfectly in character it was almost intimidating, especially since I was new-ish to the fandom and to playing Ava. Overall, an absolute joy to write with.\n\nNow, when it came to shipping I really wanted to do Ava x Jenna. I mentioned this in my intro post (which I didn\u2019t get around to making until *after* I\u2019d been RPing with Kyle for a while), and a few minutes later got a request from a Jenna account, almost immediately followed by a little OOC message from the Kyle account explaining he\u2019d seen my post and told an IRL friend, who agreed to make an account to RP and potentially ship with my Ava. She also sent me a starter pretty quickly after adding me and I spent that afternoon RPing (separately) with both of them.\n\nThe RP between Ava and Jenna also started with them hanging out and soon (probably a little *too* soon, in hindsight) confessing their feelings for each other, which led to their first NSFW scene. Things were moving pretty fast between them, but for once I didn\u2019t mind because she was also an incredible writer. Even the smut itself was extremely well written, and just like Kyle, she was always very much in character. The girls officially got together and I had Ava excitedly tell Kyle about it. He seemed happy for them.\n\nDays went by and I kept RPing with them, mostly Jenna because Kyle just wasn\u2019t around as much. I couldn\u2019t believe how lucky I\u2019d gotten with this ship, and on my first try too! She\u2019d initiate NSFW scenes more often than I\u2019d usually like, but again I didn\u2019t care because everything was just that good. Until one day as they were, well, about to start, Jenna mentioned they\u2019d be having an \u2018audience\u2019. I was confused, but then the Kyle account joined our chat and walked into Jenna\u2019s bedroom. Um, okay? I just let it slide. I\u2019m not into voyeurism or anything but I guess I just didn\u2019t want to upset my partner and risk losing the amazing RP/ship we had. So I told myself it was no big deal and played along.\n\nThe scene went by as normal, except with Kyle there watching and\u2026 enjoying. I thought that was that\u2026 And then next thing I know, Jenna and Kyle are getting it on in front of Ava! Now, if you\u2019re into threesomes, open relationships, polyamory and the like, IRL or in RP or both, nothing wrong with that. No judgement or hate from me. But I\u2019m not. *At all*. I was really taken aback and not sure what to do, so I just made Ava be clearly confused and uncomfortable about the whole thing, even hinting at her being hurt. At this point Jenna started godmodding a bit, talking about how much her girlfriend was supposedly enjoying the sight (I\u2019m sorry, what the hell?!) and how it \u2018would be her turn soon\u2019. That was it for me. I excused myself, logged off for the night and stayed away for a few days to cool off and think about what I\u2019d do next.\n\nAfter about a week, I hesitantly logged back in. I did one last very brief RP with each one of them, pretty much at the same time. Kyle first approached Ava normally, as friends. They (awkwardly) talked for a bit, until he tried to initiate a NSFW scene with her out of nowhere. Meanwhile, Jenna was being all sweet and loving to Ava. Like, a lot more than usual. Then she dropped the bomb: she\u2019d been regularly sleeping with Kyle since that one night. Ava was obviously sad and angry and hurt, but Jenna said she was only doing it because she loved Ava, wanted her to be happy, and couldn\u2019t wait to \u2018show her everything she learned\u2019, before also trying to start a NSFW scene. I once again excused myself and left as they were both trying to take her to bed.\n\nI didn\u2019t use my RP account at all for a couple weeks after that. I did eventually come back, I guess just to see what had happened while I was gone. Jenna\u2019s account was gone, and I had an OOC message from Kyle\u2019s saying he missed me, that it was so cool how all three characters had ended up \u2018dating\u2019 each other (again, WHAT?!), but that the person who RPed Jenna had left, he\u2019d lost contact with her and now Kyle couldn\u2019t wait to \u2018have Ava all to himself\u2019. I deleted my account after reading it.\n\nThat\u2019s probably been my worst RP experience ever, precisely because of how well it all started. I know I could\u2019ve also handled it better, but at least this experience taught me just how important it can be to communicate with your partner OOC, and to list and be clear about not only your RP preferences but also your limits. Also, after comparing Kyle and Jenna\u2019s writing styles and going over everything that happened, I\u2019ve realized it was most likely the same person behind both accounts all along. Of course I could be wrong, but the more I think about it the more sense that makes considering how everything played out.\n\nTo end this post on a happier note, I eventually decided to make a brand new account for Ava on that same website because I still loved the character and the rest of the fandom was actually nice and fairly active. And I'm glad I did because I ended up finding a different Jenna account to ship with. We\u2019ve been RPing for a long time now, haven\u2019t once done NSFW because they just don't do it (and I\u2019m more than okay with that, trust me), but we\u2019ve become good friends OOC and created so many amazing stories together. Our Ava and Jenna are currently engaged and we still have lots of plans for them!",
