            "selftext": "I'm not really sure how to start this so I'm just going to jump in. I'll call my writing partner 'Star' just to make it easier to read. \n\nStar and I have been roleplaying for about six months now. She's a great writer and our styles go great together! In the beginning we would reply multiple times a day or at the very least once a day, every now and again we would break routine but it was nothing major. I always say that if my partner needs a break then to just tell me, I'm pretty laid back with it all. Well the last three months haven't been good between us. We were getting kinda close, voice chatting, playing games online, etc. All of a sudden she just starts to shut me out. Okay, no big deal, maybe she just has stuff going on.\n\nTurns out she had some problems at home. I told her to take her time and we can continue our story later, her health comes first. After two weeks she start talking to me again, not about rp but super depressing stuff. She'll say things like she isn't eating or everything is a mess, whenever I respond she doesn't reply. I'm no stranger to mental illness, I am actually mentally disabled due to trauma. I can see some warning signs, I try to be nice and respectful when she does reach out but tbh I am a little lost.\n\nAfter three months of sending me depressing stuff and then not responding when I reply, I decided to ask if she would want to continue or make a new story when she felt better. I asked if I could delete our sever in the meantime since it was just sitting there (was actually kinda sad to look at it since I loved our story so much). I wasn't trying to be pushy at all but I didn't see the point in continuing the rp when she isn't doing well. She instantly started messaging me saying she was gonna post in the server and that she wants rp again.\n\nI was a little surprised but said okay, I told her not to force herself but that I'll leave it up. Two more weeks pass and nothing. I see her online and will ask how she's doing, no response. I ask again one day about the server and get instant replies again. Just yesterday she posted in the rp twice and says she's gonna post again today. I know I'm selfish for asking her about the rp so much but I don't know how else to get her to respond. Now that she is replying to our rp like she used to I'm starting feel really uncomfortable about it all. It just all feels off. Star is a great person, sweet, funny, and an amazing writer. Am I wrong to want to end this rp because I think it's stressing her out? I know she'll get mad if I do and I want to stay her friend, but I feel like she is forcing herself to reply to me.",

            "selftext": "First post here. This was an altered version of an old post I put somewhere about 2 months ago. \n I feel like I have to post this,however, because I'm closing the chapter on this part of my life. I'm posting this on an alt account, so she won't find out...but I feel like she somehow will.\n\nThis post is about an old friend of mine, who's now not my friend. It's the small things, like Discord and Reddit, that would sit in my phone and make me remember her. Everytime I would get these reminders, I used to getting morbidly depressed anytime it comes up. And there were and still are....a lot of reminders. I do want to ask, however, if you believe I did the right thing, because sometimes I feel like I did the wrong thing.\n\nThis is going to be a long post, so I'll include a TL:DR before the post &amp; after, because I really need help.\n\n\nTL:DR- Left one 3-year long friendship with someone online over things she did to my roleplay characters, to her characters, as well as abandoning me for 2 months to talk with others for a while. I felt consistently stressed when I'd see a message from her, and made me genuinely hate things I used to enjoy.  Am I right to have left these, and how can I feel better about it?\n\nIts been several months since I left them. I made these decisions based on how I felt around those times, and I'm not sure if it was right. I was just incredibly upset at the time with them over the things they did, and the whole situation really devolved. It's actually kinda taken me months to recover from it, mostly because of how sick she made me feel. I will try to explain what happened and why I felt this way in phases.\n\n\n*The friend from a few months ago*-\n\nI feel really bad about leaving her. We used to talk for hours at a time every day. We had a long distance friendship over the phone, and we spoke through discord a bunch. We liked a lot of similar things:Roleplaying(we rped on this medieval server for ages),Minecraft, medieval stuff, and some cartoon shows we watched and stuff. She was a bit weird, however, as she said her mom was a witch(an actual one), and that she could...read my thoughts sometimes? I don't believe that second part now, but when she told me about that sort of stuff a long time back, it just...irked me.Over the three years that our friendship had grown, things began spiraling quickly. I wonder if it was mostly me, but sometimes, things her characters did towards mine(like....kill them, or rip an arm off....etc...yeah...) just made me pissed off. Her characters would always get destroyed or atrociously harmed, and it bugged me. As someone who invested time and effort into these character's lives, she would bring the problems from other roleplays as well to plague her characters. I understand that people have to go through tribulations in roleplays, but this was...almost a daily instance and randomly here and there. Sometimes...when we weren't even rping...\n\nEX:\n\nHer: -\"Hey. So...'(random character name here?) just got their arm ripped off\"-\n\nMe, now feeling sick because I couldn't do anything to really help her character that I love: \u2022\"Oh...thats...bad.\"\u2022\n\nHer: -\"Yeah. They also waterboarded them......\"-\n\nMe, feeling like I could potentially cry because I love this character.: \u2022\"....will they be okay?\"\u2022\n\n\nAnother EX:\n\nHer: -\"(insert random character name here) just got cursed, and is now bound to a suit of armor by a wizard.\"-\n\nMe: \u2022\"Is there anything I can do?\"\u2022\n\nHer: -\"I don't know\"-\n\n\nOne last EX:\n\nHer: -\"(random character name) just got stabbed in the legs, and kicked in the ribs by bandits. They can't walk.\"-\n\nMe: \u2022\"That's awful. Why would someone do that to a kid?\"\u2022\n\nHer: -\"Idk. People are f-ed up.\"-\n\nSomething that bugged me was that she decided to allow this kinda stuff to happen to her characters, instead of saying something to the people she would rp with or leave the rp. This bothered me, because I knew she'd still went with it, and that she was going to rp the consequences of this character getting hurt...that I had no control over whatsoever. She said that she didn't want any control with her characters, but...this felt like an excuse.\n\nSomething I also wondered was if she lied about this. She did tell me that she left a friendship that made her slightly sadistic. I wish I would've taken this as a warning sign, because maybe that friendship rubbed off on her....a lot.\n\nSo I tried to go with the flow of it, and my characters became more supportive and kind to hers. This was..also in a way, my way of trying to remedy things that happened to them.\n\nI think she found this...boring.\n\n*The Loop*\n\nSometimes, these characters were involved in a thing called 'The Loop'. This would essentially mean they would grow up here and there before being 'reset' as a kid.... They would also regenerate if they were killed, yet feel the effects of their death. This had some interesting implications that later proved to be slightly....f-ed up, in my opinion.\n\nAn example of this was my character 'Violet' and her character 'David'(I changed the name for confidentiality). They were both older, around 20s or so. I don't remember how it happened exactly, but it...weirded me out. He got 'reset' once, and just like that, he was a kid again. What made this awkward, however, was that he still acted like Violet's boyfriend despite him being....7ish years old.\n\nThe Loop allowed those with it to regenerate if killed, but the things that happened to these characters were awful. Some would get shanked and bleed to death by other people's characters or would get beat up for fun. She just let this happen, saying that she wanted to keep all control away from the characters, but like I said, this just feels now like an excuse.\n\nI'm sorry, but if your 8 year old character who can regenerate again is being tortured and waterboarded as soon as they regenerate, it sounds like you need to...stop the roleplay and tell the people you are rping with that that is a little bit too much.\n\nI get f-ed up stuff happens. But the Loop made things so much worse, meaning those that regenerated from it would still have to go through the pain of dying horribly, which in her case...was often. And it...made me feel awful.\n\nFor each character, the Loop worked differently, but they all ended up the same way: becoming someone or something. \n\nOne character of hers, called 'Conflict'(I changed the name with a synonym of the actual name), always ended up becoming a psychopath with the ability to use strings to take control of people. Even if you had a fatherly figure sort of character to help raise them in a nice way and teach them to use their powers for good, she would find some way to fuck up there life. Whether it be one of her characters ripping a hole in their arm, or a large dragon using mental powers to twist their mind into some sort of sick servant. She would find a way to ruin their life or get what she wanted.\n\nWhich, if you think about it, it is her choice. But this just ruined any fun that I really had rping with her.\n\nOur rp was a post-apocalyptic one, that was set on an island. A character of hers that was 8 years old, who was also a street rat and an orphan, was taken in by a retired solder character(age 30) of mine. My soldier character(we'll nickname him Cain) had his wife and kids killed by an organization(part of his backstory) and so he saw this young boy as a son. He decided to look after the boy, protect him from the violent things in the setting we had, and even called him his son. He bought a house, got a job, a pet(rped by her)and things were going well. When a plague suddenly rolled through, Cain made sure to keep the boy safe. Out of the blue one day(as in, literally in an instant...), she decided to have the pet suddenly get sick and then suddenly he infected the boy...who in one or two sentences then died.\n\nNot only did this leave my character having a PTSD moment, but it left me crying behind my phone. As someone who has depression, and a lot of anxiety unfortunately, this felt like getting shot by a bullet. She then decided' oh! This character is now a poltergeist!'So she made the character a poltergeist...who kept telling mine to 'stop crying' and 'don't worry about me'. Ah yes. Thank you Loop for ruining yet another friendship between one of my characters and hers.\n\nIt's this kinda stuff that...I dealt with so much.\n\n I'll stop talking about this, but, I want to show a final example of the wretched power of the Loop. She had a 9 year old character named 'Moe'(I changed the name again). They would always grow up, but I noticed they'd always lose their arms and their legs and get them replaced with robotic ones because they just happened to know from a previous life that they could do this. I tried to stop or alter things, but no matter what happened, it would always lead to them getting hurt and eventually, their limbs replaced with robotic ones.\n\nThese would happen in gruesome ways in front of my characters, and it wore me down so much. These were my first rping experiences, besides another one that I had with another friend(who was nowhere near this violent).\n\n\n\n*When I Ended Up Leaving.*\n\n Sometimes, I would lose my cool, because I was so genuinely pissed off at things that happened towards my characters. Her characters actions and her actions on her characters were ruining something that I enjoyed, so I tried to stop rping with her. It wasn't\n just the rp that made me angry, however. It seemed like it was all she wanted to do...was just rp with me or just play video games. \n\nThings got progressively worse when I needed to talk about things and vent. She was the only person at the time that I could really speak to about things at the time(besides my brother, who was tired of listening about my problems)[I typically try to be quiet about issues I have...like my lack of friends because I'm shy]. We would speak about things, and she would listen, but when it was things directed at her, she didn't seem to change...despite saying she would. Eventually, she didn't speak to me for 2 whole months. I don't know why. I didn't respond back, because I was somewhat happy to have a break, but also because I didn't want to bug her(I felt like coming forward with my problems was sometimes bugging her). \n\nSome time after, she responded with an 'i'm sorry' paragraph about how she forgot to *check up* on me. I wasn't offended by this, until I realized she'd ditched me for other people. She'd been hanging out with others, and hadn't messaged me back or anything for 2 whole months. At this time, I'd been so stressed about what had happened, and this was the last straw. (It wasn't the fact that she was hanging out with these people. She had forgotten about me, and in her message, stated that a friend mentioned me...which reminded her to 'check up on me').\n\nI stated why I was leaving, and we had a brief conversation...which was painful because I got angry...and upset at her again, before leaving.\n\nI know that I probably sounded childish, but especially in my life at that moment, she was the only person I'd really trusted to tell things. Being a mix between Extrovert/Introvert, I was just screwed up after this. She'd stated a month before things went south how she felt that she went through cycles of people leaving her and coming in her life. \n\nI didn't think on this, and instead, blamed myself a lot over all of this. I still do, too, as I could've definitely acted differently(maybe could've not so angry)...but I believe I didn't blow things too out of proportion.\n\nI'm just hurting over it.\n\n\nNow...with all this said, did I rightfully leave this friendship? Is this normal in an rp?   I think what makes me feel so awful is that now, I'm lonely and I feel like it will be hard to really connect again with someone or...anyone.\n\n\nTL:DR- Left one 3-year long friendship with someone online over things she did to my roleplay characters, to her characters, as well as abandoning me for 2 months to talk with others for a while.

I don't mind this, usually its a great way to understand the other person's writing style and generally get to know a new partner. \n\nHowever, I generally type up a full paragraph or two. I tend to go overboard with my posts and don't expect anyone to mirror, but i do expect content. This guy started off great, a paragraph but slowly over the next day started getting shorter and shorter until the last few posts.\n\nIssue is, I sorta ghosted the guy, it wasnt intentional, irl got very complicated and I needed a few days. When all was said and done, and I let my normal partners know, I felt the effort for this guy wasn't worh it. Now, though, this dude is down voting my posts every single time.\n\nMy questions are am I in the wrong here, mind you I continued to post 1 to 2 paragraphs till I had to break, and what should I do so my posts don't keep getting down voted which affect my partner searches.",

            "selftext": "I think this is the place to write this, sorry if it isn\u2019t. Sorry tor the layout, I\u2019m on mobile. I\u2018m the owner of a discord server for the videogame Danganronpa, where everyone there can just talk about the games and shit. Two people came to me and said, \u201cHey OP, would you like to gamemaster a KG for us? We\u2019d think it\u2019d be really fun!\u201d For thise who don\u2019t know, a killing game (KG) is basically a danganronpa insert where the players Danganronpa OCs are set into a Danganronpa setting where they have to kill each other, figure out the murders, or die. It\u2019s really fun when it\u2019s executed correctly. I had never ran a KG before, but I had gamemastered DND campaigns, so I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be too hard. I agreed to do it, because quarantine is boring and why not? What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Famous last words. \n\nOur Cast:\nMyself (M)\nDrunk Lesbian (DL)\nSmol Bean (SB)\nEdgelord Cultist (EC)\nEdgy Puppeteer (EP) \nRapist Actor (RA)\nAngsty Musician (AM) \nUltimate Therapist\n\n     The KG was ran on discord, and we had a server for it. I actually wasn\u2019t the owner of the server, Edgy Puppeteer was. I had told everyone I thought it be cool if we did a Preforming Arts School, and I had told everyone that was my plan for the layout. Apparently, miscommunication was made and EP did not make it a Preforming Arts Layout. He made it a regular school setting. I could\u2019ve changed the layout very easily, but people wanted to start very soon, and everyone was happy with EP\u2019s layout, so I let it go. It\u2019s the not the worse thing in the world. \n     Drunk Lesbian said in the server, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if we had people in the server who could read the chats and watch the story happen? They could spectate and stuff!\u201d Three other people agreed, and I said, \u201cWhy would anyone want to do that? That\u2019d be boring.\u201d Four other people agreed with me, and said that they\u2019d be uncomfortable with people in the server just randomly reading the chats. No one listens to the gamemaster, I guess. Drunk Lesbian and Edgy Puppeteer decided to just go ahead and do it, and told me to go advertise it in my discord server, and on my meme page. I basically was peer pressured, which looking back was dumb on my part. So, we had spectators in the server who watched my every move and made me incredibly nervous and paranoid. \n     Mostly everyone sent me their characters backstory and just general knowledge on them. I wrote down notes for things to do in the future woth them, but I noticed a reoccurring problem. All these characters had very, very edgy backstories. For example: Edgy Puppeteer lived in an orphanage and killed some of the orphans and he\u2019s very dark and mysterious and loves death. Basically, half the cast had killed even before they were in the killing game. Which made no sense to me. Why had so many people killed? My character (the overseer and monokuma character basically) had a dark backstory, but I needed to give him one for people to understand why he\u2019s forcing all these characters to be trapped in a school and kill for his and the mastermind\u2019s amusement. I tried to make it as \u2018unedgy\u2019 as possible. I had confirmed a cast of 16 members, just like how Danganronpa does it. Edgy Puppeeter decided to add 3 more people in the server without telling me, and I had found out the next day without anyone communicating with me that they were going to do that. So now, we had 19 members. 20 including myself. \n     Before the first session began, I had already planned out the first chapter\u2019s murder. I wanted to happen on the second\u2019s day night to kickstart into the killing game and show the characters that this is no joke, and they\u2019re really in this environment. The victim was Edgelord Cultist, and the murderer was the only person in that game who actually seemed to care. They both knew before the first session the story, and what was going to happen. The murder was going to happen in the gymnasium, the weapon a dumbbell. The first session was just the first two days, where all the characters woke up and were told they had to murder each other by my character, then they had to set out to explore the entire place. Then, the next day would seem to be just the characters settling into their new lives, and then the murder would happen in the night and take them all by surprise. The first thing I noticed was that about six characters were flirting with one another. We had an ultimate therapist (who actually killed the edgelord cultist) and the edgelord cultist came to her on the SECOND DAY OF KNOWING EVERYONE and said, \u201cI think I\u2019m in love with Angsty Musician. I\u2019ve never deeply cared about someone this much before.\u201d Dude, it\u2019s the second day of knowing him. How is that love? Why are you even trying to fall in love, your character should be more concerned about getting out alive! When Edgelord Cultist told me their character, they told me they were very anti-social, cold, distant, and didn\u2019t care much for people. By falling in love by the second day...isn\u2019t that a total 180 on your character? Anyways, it gets to nighttime and I\u2019m telling the Edgelord to go to the gym so we can start the murder, and they refuse to answer my dms or acknowledge me. They just kept flirting with the Angsty Musician and doing that two day relationship of theirs. By this time, it\u2019s Eleven PM in real life, and I decide to just end session and try again next time. I tell everyone the session is over, and we\u2019ll pick back up next time. Edgy Puppeteer says to everyone in the announcements, \u201cKeep going with the session in the pool, we can all just have a pool party. (;\u201d I went to bed. When I checked the pool party chat the next day, I was stunned. It was basically everyone fucking each other and doing very nsfw things in that chat. I was upset, as everyone seemed to be taking the relationships more serious than the actual story and environment they were. My character implemented a \u2018no fucking rule\u2019 where if they tried to do anything too physically romantic, the characters would be shocked by the security bracelet that had a tracker on it. That, mostly worked. In Chapter Two I used it on Edgy Puppeteer because he was breaking the rules, and he just deleted my messages (since he is owner) and kept going. \n    I know that in a roleplay not everything will go the direction you intend, but this is a killing game. The characters are in NOT mentally stable enough to have a healthy relationship. Especially when everyone is doing it. \n    Next session, I finally got Edgelord Cultist to go to the gymnausium after a lot of asking, and the murder happened. The investigation happens, it seems pretty alright, and it\u2019s time for the class trial to seem who killed the Edgelord Cultist. The trial was a MESS. No matter how much I asked them to only speak when it was beneficial or in character, everyone just talked over each other and tried to be the \u2018star\u2019 of the trial. For two hours they talked in circles and never managed to come to any conclusions because no one would let anyone else talk or agree. Finally, when the time limit ended, my character said he\u2019d keep the murderer in the game if they didn\u2019t vote correctly, as punishment for not cooperating in the trial. I didn\u2019t want to kill everyone on the First Trial because they weren\u2019t sure of how it should be yet. 13 people voted for the Ultimate Therapist, and six refused to vote because they, \u201cwere too sad to think of the Ultimate Therapist like that.\u201d So, since not everyone came to the same conclusion, I kept the Ultimate Therapist in the game as she was sort of an antagonistic character, and I wanted to see more we could do with her. \n     I\u2019m getting tired of typing so much, but basically what happened in Chapter Two:\n- The Two Victims threw a huge fit that they had to die in the KILLING GAME.\n- The murderer refused to answer my DMs after being picked and would not join any sessions. \n- Rapist Actor almost raped Angsty Musician before I intervened. Rapist Actor did not ask if it was okay to do in session with either me, or the Angsty Musician. HALF OF THE CHARACTERS WERE TELLING ANGSTY MUSICIAN IT WAS HIS FAULT. ANGSTY MUSICIAN WAS A V E R Y CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTER, BUT NO ONE. NO ONE DESERVES TO BE RAPED. \n- Smol Bean was the traitor, and we had planned out everything he was going to do and his motivations for doing so. He decided in a session to randomly make his character paralyzed and just completely do a 180 and now all his motivations did not make sense, and a lot of the things could not happen since he was PARALYZED. Or, it\u2019d be very unbelievable. \n- Ultimate Therapist had a mental breakdown after killing Edgelord Cultist, (her player asked if that was okay to do, and I said it made sense to me). Smol Bean was in the room and just randomly decided to have a mental breakdown too for no reason and all the characters paid attention to Smol Bean, and no one seemed to care if Ultimate Therapist was okay. \n- Drunk Lesbian was upset that Ultimate Therapist was straight, and did not want to date a client. Completely in character! Drunk Lesbian threw many fits over this.\n- There was no alcohol in the school, because none of the player\u2019s characters were over 21. Drunk Lesbian randomly made up finding beer without asking me, and pretended to act drunk in the least believable possible.\n- The second trial was a mess, was very rushed by me because the murderer wouldn\u2019t join the sessions, so I was sad with how it went. It was very rushed but I didn\u2019t blame the characters for this, as I was unsure of how to go on with a murder when the murderer refuses to join/or talk to me. I had to get a spectator to fill in and just get executed. \n- Edgy Puppeeter, Smol Bean, and another character decided to have a threesome and deleted my messages of intervention. \n\n     After Chapter Two was over, I decided I did not want to do it anymore. No one really seemed to care for my story, and just wanted to fuck. I left a message in the announcements saying I was leaving, and I did not care if they replaced me or just went their separate ways. According to my friend, barely anyone cared and replaced me in 15 minutes. I\u2019m gamemastering a new killing game, and it\u2019s going very well. The people here actually care for the story. Sorry for any grammar or spelling errors, I wrote this pretty quickly as I have to go to the store soon. So yeah, that was my nightmare of a killing game. It\u2019s fun to tell others and see their shocked reactions now, at least. A positive from the negatives.",

Firstly, she ghosted the roleplay for a considerable amount of time, and when she returned, she posted a post on the roleplay forums seeking for new roleplays of the same genre, as if she didn't have existing roleplays that she didn't complete. Like it's bad enough for you to ghost others, but she doesn't even have the face to stick around and say something about our current roleplay? It irks me that she'd be comfortable with leaving it half-done, only to start an open post asking for new roleplays. If there was something she didn't like, she could at least have said something, that is, assuming she ghosted and cancelled because she had something she didn't like, rather than just not having a good reason at all.\nSorry guys, just had a lot of steam to blow off. I'm just tired of not being able to find genuine, interested and involved roleplay partners in my particular field of interest. Can anyone relate? Could y'all tell me any trade secrets on finding good partners who neither ghost nor lack effort?",

Things are going pretty good, I\u2019d say. We wrote out profiles and sent them to each other so that we know a little more about our characters.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been developing the characters pretty nicely, but I\u2019m beginning to think that some of my irl personality is blending with my current characters. For an example, my character, whose named Pinecone for her ability to transform different parts of her body into spiny spiked things, is inherently mean and selfish, and sticks her nose up at everything. She is callous to others, and she only cares about herself mostly. \n\nShe does have a soft side, but only for her parents, whom of which are counting on her. \n\nI wrote her pretty well to begin with, her attitude problem coming through and her meaness shining. But, then she started to become more or so softer and goofier, which matches my personality outside of the story. When my character and my partners character had an arguement, she took it extremely personally and nearly started crying, when usually she\u2019d just stick her nose up and not care as much. When they made up, she kissed them and hugged them tight, even though she doesn\u2019t like cheesy corny stuff like that. \n\nAlso, she has begun to make meme references and do fortnite dances when she\u2019s deep in thought. \n\nShe started as this badass cold woman, and is now starting to morph into this softie, goofy villain. Which is fine, but still. I would rather her have goofy moments rather than being goofy in general.\n\nAny advice as to how I can fix this? I want to make sure she\u2019s badass, not a dumbass. She can be goofy and stuff but not so goofy and soft that she loses what made her whole.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am the creator of an RP group with a small following. My friends and I set it up as we give a good chunk of the lore/setting but let the members create their own character lore to fit into the setting. Then as a collective group we get to the main plot and experience together with the members. As long as they avoid overpowered characters, etc. (We made sure as the creators to also follow this rule and leave major lore characters as npcs for rp so the members don\u2019t feel like we are placing ourselves \u2018above\u2019 them.)\n\nTo get to the main issue. There was another member who was quite nice and supportive in the beginning. I thought she was very sweet. So we did seem to get along with her. That was until we started rpying and she seemed to display passive aggression, and would be very verbal and opinionated if she did not like how something was set up. I would try to explain my reasoning, and ultimately switch around stuff to try and better the story.\n\nShe also started to display this when other people received attention in rps and not hers, and would distance her character. \nSo when she came to me asking if she could make a antagonistic character with 500 years of the main plot\u2019s backstory, and a very strong power. ((also the character\u2019s appearance and backstory replicating other member\u2019s characters.)) My friend\u2019s and I asked for changes to be made to make sure this antagonist is fair, and would not have a clear power difference than the other characters, as he isn\u2019t an npc. Just a main character she wanted place in.\n\nWe tried to make suggestions and alternatives on the first try. She expressed it was not what she wanted and it was too different. So we were a little more firm on our second attempt. Clarifying why we needed the changes to be done, as we want to make sure the group is fair and comfortable for all. ((We as the creators also stuck to our own rules.))\n\nAfter our firm reply she just ghosted if I am being honest. It has been at least two weeks now. Her friend remains somewhat active but also passive aggressive towards us. We are unsure if we should ask her to leave if this is the behavior she displays, or if we were in the wrong with what we said to her?",

            "selftext": "Hi all, just here to vent. Obviously the title is sarcastic. \n\nI started roleplaying with someone rather recently (we\u2019ll call them Sam), and they\u2019re an absolutely amazing partner for the most part. I love their writing, we mesh really well together, we both put a lot of thought in effort into the story, super great all around. \n\nExcept.... the communication. Sam loves to just disappear from the rp without any warning whatsoever, even when still active online. When we first started the rp, Sam was actually the one to tell me that I should ping them whenever they haven\u2019t responded in a while (they said if it had been about half a day, then message them). At first I never had to do this, but as time went on there would be days where I got no response at all from them. Of course I was worried, so I asked if they were still interested in the story. They responded \u201cyes of course!\u201d and were very enthusiastic about it, and a couple days later we got into our normal routine again. \n\nBut now they just keep disappearing. At first they always told me when they would be away, when they wouldn\u2019t respond for a while.... which I really appreciate. I totally understand if you\u2019ve got other things to do or other people to talk to\u2014 this doesn\u2019t bother me at all, but just say something first. Sam doesn\u2019t say anything first. They\u2019ll say \u201cGoing to bed, I\u2019ll respond in the morning\u201d and then I\u2019ll spend 4 days without hearing a single word from them. When I message to ask if everything\u2019s ok, it\u2019s always \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d but yet I still don\u2019t hear a single word about the rp; it\u2019s like they\u2019re avoiding it. Meanwhile they\u2019re active online and posting things like \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d.... obviously they aren\u2019t extraordinarily busy, or something. At least not busy enough to where they can\u2019t communicate properly with me. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated just because it didn\u2019t start like this, and I did everything in my power to prevent it. I told Sam straight up to tell me if they were ever overwhelmed or needed a break. Sam said of course they\u2019d tell me. And yet here we are, going weeks without a reply to a story that I figured we both really cared about. Again\u2014 I\u2019m totally fine with breaks. But communicate that. It isn\u2019t that difficult! Especially when I\u2019ve already told them to please tell me if they\u2019re ever needing a break or something.\n\nI would believe Sam has lost interest and is ghosting me, except that they\u2019ve said multiple times they love the rp. They even save it on a google doc, have plans to edit it into a more cohesive story, and joke about turning it into a book some day (it\u2019s really really long, lol). But at the same time, I\u2019m worried because Sam has alluded to ghosting other rps they\u2019ve been in in the past, which is never a good sign. It just frustrates me to no end that I never feel like I have any reliable communication from them. And I don\u2019t want to keep asking them about it for fear of pestering and annoying them. But gahhhh. It\u2019s so frustrating. Especially because I honestly love the story and I love Sam as an rp partner (aside from this)!\n\nThanks for letting me vent, Reddit :)",

            "selftext": "This time, I want to share my most frustrating experiences with ghosting. This has happened many times (maybe five or more? idk) in my years of roleplaying, and unfortunately I don't know a way to avoid it. \n\nIt always starts like this: someone writes me about a search I posted or about the possibility of writing with my characters in a group rp. They are very interested, immediately start planning, and often suggests that we draw pictures to use as a face claim/ invent our own world with a lot of countries, and so on. In group rps, they will suggest that our characters have a shared history, are best friends, in general just stuff that would make it very hard for me to write that character if the co-writer should disappear. \n\nMost of the time, they will invite me to other group rp they take part in. Often, they are almost too involved and seem to care only about the rp and nothing else (replying often, being very chatty ooc, inviting you to talk to them over discord to discuss it). All my ideas seem to be well-received.\n\nSo I begin drawing or creating my character profiles, and one day (usually after two weeks max.) they are gone. No replies to my messages, no nothing.\n\nThey always disappear very suddenly. One moment you are in the middle of planning the rp, the next moment you are blocked/their account is deleted or they have deleted their roles in your shared group rp. Sometimes, they stay in the rp and are regularly online/searching, but just choose to not reply to your private messages until you delete it. \n\ni just don't get it. With these types, it is never obvious before that they have problems with the rp or irl. It never 'fades out'. It always goes from fawning over the rp to gone forever. There is never a clearly defined reason I could think of for their sudden loss of interest (for example, I could understand leaving after I created my character profiles because they do not like them and are afraid to tell me. because they want to avoid confrontion or whatever).\n\nIt is so frustrating and keeps me from fully enjoying a roleplay because I always think 'A well, here we go again.' If someone seems 'too' interested.",

Jupiter is a human who is part demon, dragon, immortal, and a warlord... you can see where this is going. If any character tries to fight him, he will always have the advantage. After beating your character, he will then prodece to tortue them to death. (Not joking). In the rp, he also has a girl friend, (call her.. mercury) and if any character hurts mercury, even in self defense, he will make them unable to move, and then tortue them. Mercury is usally a good rper, however, she is basically never disagrees with jupiter in rp. Unfortunately, hes an admin, but he wont ban you for disagreeing with him.",
