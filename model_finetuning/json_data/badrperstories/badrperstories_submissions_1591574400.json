            "selftext": "This is a bit of a long rant about my experiences with sexual/erotic roleplay over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mind ERP, it is just that I see a difference between sex in a movie and sex in pornography. If something sensual is there to further a plot or story, then it is usually enjoyable and interesting. The problem? It's too much like porn. Way too much like porn, or people writing as if their only sexual experience comes from hentai.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI frequent and have frequented a lot of communities &amp; servers with a focus on sexual roleplay, only to be disappointed by awkward writing and situations or just straight-up creepers. The kind of \"dominant\" people who insist sex isn't fun unless they get to choke or spank their partner without asking. The kind of \"submissive\" people who can somehow handle more pain than the most hardcore of masochists. If you play with any of these folks, you're expected to go along with everything. If not, you get blocked or insulted.\n\nSomething I've noticed is that rejecting the \"dom\" and \"sub\" dynamic is apparently a controversial view in the community, thus I am labeled a \"switch\" because the characters I play can usually fill any role in a relationship. When it is more so the fact that my characters are not me, and might be into things that I am not. They can like different people than myself. That is somehow a difficult thing to grasp for your average ERPer. It shouldn't be a shock that two characters' relationships should be based around more than what they do in the bedroom, having more depth than being the submissivest sub that has ever subbed or the dommiest dom who has ever dommed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a quick disclaimer before this rant continues: I believe people should generally be able to write whatever the F they want. But that does not mean it's exempt from criticism. If they're a babby ERPer or babby RPer, then mistakes just happen. There is somehow a misconception that anyone who criticises (X) wants to censor it. When maybe they just think the (X) is kind of a shitty thing, so I will now move on to the next topics:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoring and predictable characterisation. Of course, any guy who is skinny must automatically be gay. Any girl with even a hint of muscle defintion must be an aggressive top. Any guy who is short must be submissive, and any girl who is tall must be dominant. These are traits that I don't get, since one's physical appearance usually doesn't translate to how one acts or what one is into. Of course a part of character design is playing with personality or physique to make things fit or make sense to the reader or viewer, though I doubt that is the intention behind this.  \n\n\nFetishism and fetishization. It is as if there's a hidden rule that every erotic roleplaying server has at least a few token \"trap\" or \"futa\" characters. While not inherently problematic on their own, the characters are usually nothing beyond the fetish. I am trans (MtF), so it's probably me being biased by criticising these types of characters. There can be interesting stories about crossdressing, or characters who do have both packages. It's just that... Nobody who writes those characters are interested in any characterisation beyond the fetish and a token personality. Which frustrates me while also making me uncomfortable. Of course if I point out the lost potential of such characters, I am apparently trying to censor them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSex is usually a big part of ERP, obviously. But never have I seen a condom. I am not kidding. I have never seen a condom being used in any roleplaying server or community I've frequented. This might be me making a mountain out of a molehill, yet I find the lack of condoms to be weird. Almost concerning, but that is just me. Then you got forceful penetration of the backdoor, which makes me flinch whenever I read it. Nor are a lot of partners aware that foreplay is in fact a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me it's hard to tell if I've just frequented the wrong communities for the years I've played, or if this is less widespread than I actually believe. Or if I am over-reacting. Is basic sex ed too much to ask for, or characters who are beyond a cut cookie?",

When I found out actual roleplay was a thing, with a plot and everything, I knew I wanted to take part in it. However, it was sooo bad at first. I look back and cringe. I used to do cringey things such as:\n\nHey babe *kisses you*\n\nAnd just leave it at that. My plots were all bad, actual roleplayers were like, \"Dude, you seem like a nice person, but you need to work on your writing.\" I would make roleplays all about the NSFW aspect of it, have my character say \"i love you\" after they respond to me for the second time, and I was bad at using text speak and not describing anything. Well, I would describe kissing as either passionate or rough.\n\nNow, I look back and cringe and feel sorry for the people who tried to roleplay with me because I'm so bad. I'm glad I learned from my mistakes and learned how to write, but I wish I didn't make those mistakes because my God they were awful \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.",

            "selftext": "I'll be pretty straight forward with this, yeah, I might have high expectations but when I spend a week building a lore-heavy server I should have the right to be picky. I love to world build, I make maps, I create kingdom/region history, diplomatic relations, religions, etc. I spend days, even weeks building certain servers and many times I don't make my servers live due to not wanting my work to be a waste. I am completely aware that I can go overboard on lore to the point it's a near book. When I do make my servers live I try to be understanding and laid-back, I love having others add to my stories, but I am sick and tired of being told that I expect too much when I fully explain what is expected in my servers before people join.\n\nDue to all the work I put into my servers I ask that people post a minimum of two paragraphs, they give me a literacy sample to join the group, and if they are absent for a week with no warning to anyone they forfeit their role. Running these heavy lore servers is a lot of work and I often run them alone, I tend to forgive many little things I personally don't like for the sake of the server. At the end of it all, I just want to meet new people and write a cool story. The only things I am frim on are post lengths and adhering to the lore (in a sense that it doesn't end up revolving around a single person or thing etc.). I'm not going to sit down and count sentences in people's posts, but if I ask two paragraphs, put it in my rules, announce it in my ads, and you make a character, hang out with everyone and then post three sentences...I will say something.\n\nYet everyone treats me like a bad guy (not everyone, a slight exaggeration) for reminding people of my post requirements. I have nothing against people who don't like to make long posts but for my servers, I feel like two paragraphs are decent for the amount of work I put into them. Why do people join if they don't agree with the rules?! I work my ass off in these servers and do my best to keep everyone happy, I will give people multiple warnings but after they ignore me, I have no choice but to kick them from the story (also noted in my rules). Yet I still get people DM'ing me like 'But why?'. I just want a lengthy literate roleplay server with heavy lore. &gt;.&lt;  \n\n\nAnd my title isn't a typo, that was the exact quote of the last person to DM me after I kicked them from my server. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m new to reddit, but I\u2019ve been here for a while and enjoy roleplay so I thought I should just get this off somewhere I could have people relate lol. \n\nI\u2019ve been in roleplay for a WHILE, since like... 5th grade? As I\u2019m coming into college, I\u2019m sort of at a halt. \n\nI\u2019ve often had rp groups that I\u2019ve fallen in and out of. They\u2019re not exactly LITERATE, but I met these people on a game and it would evolve to discord rp or on specific websites. While it isn\u2019t detailed or crazy, it\u2019s always been something enjoyable with good depth, characters, and plots that I grow attached to. \n\nI\u2019m struggling with a long time rp partner. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love roleplaying with them and they\u2019re an excellent rper, but it feels like there\u2019s no change. It\u2019s constantly fluff, or smut. I don\u2019t mind those things, I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t like them, but I feel like the story just isn\u2019t going anywhere. And my partner agrees \u2014 just they do nothing about it. \n\nI\u2019m constantly writing, trying to come up with SOMETHING, but it just never goes through. I tried introducing new formats, alternatives, literally anything but it just never happens. \n\nTo make matters worse, they roleplay elsewhere (which I have no problem with), and are constantly flexing the LENGTHY paragraphs and epics they do. But they just feel too \u201ctired\u201d to do it with me. I would respect this, but the moment I mention my friend group, it\u2019s suddenly about how I prefer them, I\u2019m roleplaying stuff I would \u201cnever\u201d with them. I\u2019ve tried, but it just doesn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t give me what I want in response. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be complaining so much if this other group actually roleplayed often either. I understand the silence as I too have issues in real life, but right now I just feel starved, and have all these ideas I want to explore. But they just end up never coming to light. \n\nI\u2019m almost afraid to bring this up anymore to upset them. I can tell that they get annoyed with me when I do. I\u2019m just not sure what to think anymore. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m stuck in a cycle of unfulfilling fluff and smut, and my roleplay partner isn\u2019t helping me fix it.",

For this story I\u2019ll call him Fire Guy, he joins the site and then immediately goes and makes an interest check for his RP. Something about portals opening around the multiverse or something like that probably some fandom crossover kind of RP or something along those lines. Plot sounded interesting, but didn\u2019t join since Im in a number of RPs.\n\nAnyway, once he as posted his interest check, Fire Guy then immediately goes and starts \u2018creating portals\u2019 as in tries to forcefully merge his RP with others. I think one of them was a One Piece RP or something like that. Without the GMs permission at all either, so the GM\nGets the mods to delete the post. Fire Guy does this to a few more RPs.\n\nWhen Fire Guy doesn\u2019t get interest or has his own way, he makes a venting post somewhere else on the forum. I sadly don\u2019t remember what all he said, but basically said that we were all beneath him and we are all dumb. \n\nThen utters these words in his weird vent/tangent. \u2018I am a fire type, and you are all peasants to me.\u2019 Something like that, the mods quickly stepped in and deleted all of his posts and permanently banned as well.\n\nSadly I wished I had screenshoted it but didn\u2019t and it was deleted.",

            "selftext": "Well, this is honestly a post that I've been reluctant to create, but here I go, because I really need to get this out of my system.\n\nHello, yes, I am a little bit of a ghoster. My actual internet identity should be easy to find, but in this context, I am similar to every person who has ever done this. For I have done it myself and associated with this behavior.\n\nAnd let me tell you, It is certainly not fun for me at all.  So in an attempt to make amends for those I have neglected, please, allow me to try and explain why I used to do this, and why others may do the same.\n\nSo without any delay, let us begin.\n\nI used to ghost, and still sometimes do, because I feel too empathetic to simply say \"No\", Other times,  I merely don't have the heart to deny another user of what I truly want, yet I cannot bring myself to roleplay with them for personal causes, distaste in the plot at hand, or other reasons. Maybe I fear that my partners may become angry or even try to retaliate. And In others I merely have too many roleplays, or lose interest and fear to ask to switch to another.\n\nTo me, it's not about personal distaste, though a potential cause, it's commonly a lack of interest, and the inability to merely tell them that I don't wish to roleplay with them out of fear of offending or angering them.\n\nDo I do it? Yes, I do. But do I regret and condone my own decisions? Yes, always.\n\nThough I'm sure I'll get some hate, if one would try to hear my argument, I would at least want for the Community to understand (assuming they don't already do so) that some of us are merely afraid, not the jerks that we are occasionally made out to be, at least, most of the time.",

            "selftext": "I keep finding servers where the staff isn't keen on their duties. I tried (tried being the operative word) to join a server that looked very promising and had a cool sandbox but still enclosed enough premise that promised a cool time. Posted my sheet and never heard a peep from any of the staff, other than one of them asking some of the previously approved members if they wanted to RP. Waited days before I deleted my sheet and left.\n\nIn another completely different genre I had a server that up until I submitted my OC and went through the approval process, I had a delightful time. They had a consistent story line, the post lengths were good as were how active they all were. And then when my OC was approved, it was like a switch was flipped.\n\nMy ooc interactions were either overlooked from older member's, if not outright ignored. I got thrown a bone once at the start when I was excited to start to RP. Someone told me to post, and that they'll respond or someone else will since it was the main meeting area....and nothing. I gently poked in the chat but wasn't acknowledged in favor of a frankly baffling conversation between other members about faux hating each other. It was very weird.\n\nAnd cut to today. I've been a part of a low-key supernatural-ish server. It's been pretty fun but I've been a bit busy irl these last few days but I did let the staff and my RP partners know. Even told them that if they wanted to skip out on the scene for a new one I would be totally fine with that. Then I get pinged not once, not twice but three times just this afternoon about how everyone *needed* to post more and be more active.\n\nI've had a few gripes with this server but the people and my partner's in scenes have been great so I've overlooked them. They have this plot line teased but the staff won't share details with anyone else. Meta gamers are a problem but even still it makes things difficult. \n\nI didn't know my OC's were approved until way later because the mods didn't tell me clearly and the suggestions from member's are met with excitement and affirmation and then half the time nothing comes of it. Which, like, okay. Feels a bit like talking to wall but maybe they aren't good with saying no. who knows.\n\nHonestly I think the posting quality can be a bit better.  There was one reply I saw that was just someone smiling and shrugging at another. A single line but to be fair there isn't a rule and my partner's and I match each other. A few lines at least but I digress. Things that may give me pause but still will continue.\n\nIt just seems bias with the staff obviously favoring their own character's. Like, I get that it's their characters. I love mine too but the Big Important npc's only seem to be open to interact with them. The 'official' plot points have only been done for staff OC's and yet we're supposed to post more and be active? I have tried to plot with them before a bit but I got the feeling my character's were going to be more or less supporting scene character's, if not an outright antagonist for one of them.\n\nEven if you wanted to get more activity, I feel like it would make sense to give some incentive for it. Events, creative idea's to bring OC's together or maybe even link them up with whatever mysterious plot future that's been cooked up. If there's a creative burnout, then encourage the member's to collaborate more freely rather than just demand activity.\n\nIt just really annoyed me today because while I love RP a lot and have been doing it for years, it's my hobby. I don't like to stress about idea's, or if I'm posting enough. I hate it when my partner's feel stressed that they aren't responding quick enough. If I see a server that looks like it'll move too quickly, if I can't take a day or so for me, then I move along. It's simple as that.\n\nIt's very disheartening to find a well organized server and friendly people but then the RP's itself just don't go well. I'm half tempted at this point to try my luck in the 'literate' servers but I'd just worry about the paragraph limits and quantity over quality. Getting stressed over reaching requirements rather than being able to collaboratively tell a story.\n\nOof, wow. I just went on and on but I certainly feel better after grumbling. Now, to think of how to word my grievances as nicely as possible so I don't ruffle the staff of the supernatural-ish server.",
