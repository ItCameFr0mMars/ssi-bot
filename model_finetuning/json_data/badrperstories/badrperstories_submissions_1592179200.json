            "selftext": "Many years ago, I stumbled into a forum-based RP community that billed itself as being a \u201csafe space for roleplayers and writers\u201d. I genuinely was excited about it at first, as it offered me a chance to be myself and express myself creatively in ways that I had not been able to in past. It was like a blessing and I was so happy about it at first.\n\nBut then things seemed to change, and I found that the happy, shiny, friendly community was not what it seemed. I found that more often then not, a partner would simply drop you in the middle of a RP and make no effort to justify their actions or the like; they would continue to RP elsewhere, but all of a sudden I\u2019d be left in the lurch. If I tried to PM a partner, they\u2019d never reply, regardless of how active they were otherwise. I quickly found that RP partners were considered to be disposable; if you didn\u2019t like how a RP was going, then you could simply throw your partner away and move on. Alternatively, if you said \u201cno\u201d to a potential RP partner they would send back comments like \u201cbefore you say no\u2026\u201d or \u201cif you\u2019re really set on it\u201d or the best, passive-aggressive approaches like \u201cit\u2019s your loss\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a shame to waste this opportunity\u201d.\n\nForum rules meant that if you had a bad experience, you could not actually name the person involved. You could PM a moderator who would politely promise to \u201cdo something about it\u201d, but I quickly found that they were either toothless, or simply making hollow reassurances in the name of maintaining an illusion. There were venting threads, yes, but again they were all anonymous. If it became clear that multiple people were complaining about the same person, then a moderator would break it up and say that \u2018rumourmongering\u2019 was against the rules.\n\nHowever, the longer I stayed there, the more awful the place became. The so-called \u201csafe space for roleplayers and writers\u201d served to actively empower and enable creeps, giving them free licence to do and say what they wanted as long as they stayed within certain bounds. I once got a PM from somebody saying that they would \u201clove to rape the shit out of (my) character\u201d. I reported this immediately, and was told that since they directed this at my character and not me, it was not against the rules. If the individual who had sent the PM ever received any disciplinary action, it was little more then a slap on the wrist as they continued to remain active. Or you\u2019d see things in picture threads like \u201cI\u2019d love to hold her down and have my way with her\u201d, which was considered to be perfectly within the rules on the board. They might be real photos of real women, but no, joking about raping them was acceptable.\n\nAnd yet I persisted. I had one good partner, and I clung on to them for dear life. But I kept trying otherwise, and I kept telling myself that next time would be different, that next time I would be happy. I tried to give up numerous times, but kept returning. I was a battered wife and the forum my abusive husband.\n\nEventually, I did give up. It was not easy. I really was afraid that I\u2019d lose that one good partner in the process, and that they were at the same time, the only person keeping me there. So I gave them an off-board contact for me, and then cut the whole thing off, hard.\n\nI made an unflattering public statement as my exit. A moderator there actually offered to talk to me about my issues, and see what could be done about them; I explained that I had no desire to return and that the site\u2019s toxic culture was to blame. Next thing I knew, he\u2019d put me onto the site\u2019s owner.\n\nWhat followed was a shameless display of victim blaming in an effort to rewrite the narrative to depict him and his community as squeaky clean. He said that \u201cclearly you were happy here\u201d (despite my post history indicating anything but) and that it must have been some personal event outside of the community that forced me to leave. I explained the situation; he asked me why I never reported any of these people, pointing out how active I was in the venting thread. I explained that nobody ever had even suggested that any of that behaviour was reportable, even when multiple people were complaining about the same person.\n\nHis reply? \u201cWe thought you were coming from a position of strength\u201d.\n\nSo I\u2019m done. I burned all my bridges and made sure that I could never go back. My only wish is that I\u2019d had the guts to do so sooner.",

            "selftext": "I left my own server that I made last summer over the winter of last year. It was mostly because real life was taking up my time, but also because I had this one staff member who turned my server into a shit show of battle systems, stats and special moves that characters could unlock. While I was away, I handed over control to my other staff because I trusted them but I came back to see that the casual server I wanted, had turned into something that might as well have been a video game.\n\nIt came as no surprise to me when I discovered that my old server was closing down. I should probably mention that when I left, I let them have everything that my friend and I made for the server, including original drawings for that setting. A whole other friend commented on how I could have set the whole thing on fire when I left by asking them to remove these things because they were mine, but I didn't care that much and I felt like that would be a giant dick move. So instead, I let them have everything so the history of the server could go on without having to change too much.\n\nLike most other rps, when one dies, another one tries to revamp what killed the old one and the people I've given my server to did the same, but with a new setting. They basically frankensteined together my old stuff with their own stuff, without ever asking me if I was okay with that and several people from my old server still had me on their friend lists. I didn't care when I handed over everything, but to make something completely new and steal my things for it? That just didn't feel right and I promptly asked them to remove my things from their new setting.\n\nThis whole ordeal had me wondering though, what's up with the blatant plagiarism in roleplay? I've heard similar stories many times before from friends in the community, why do people think this kind of thing is okay? It's pretty easy to look around the Internet and see people laugh at others who steal drawings or even memes, it has become a common thing to call people out for stealing this kind of stuff, why do people think it's different with creative writing?",

            "selftext": "update 3: time to leave the sever?\n\n\nThis post is an update to my antics with Player X, I strongly recommend you read at least the TL:DR's of these previous posts, but you don't have to.\u00a0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/fhwyjq/ongoing_bad_host_bad_rper_what_should_i_do_with_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/gsx9gl/the_antics_of_hostplayer_x_an_update/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\nWithout further ado, I'll keep this brief, but it assumes you read the TLDR of at least the first post,\u00a0\n\n\nI think it may be time to leave the communal RP server I'm on... For good\n\n\nNow, a lot of my explinations are in the two Reddit links above, but feel free to DM me or ask for elaboration on anything you want me to clarify.\n\n\nSo, A few days ago, player X DM'd me asking I'd he could continue a plotline that he had to suspend because the Characters were deemed too powerful for the realm of mine he wanted them in, and he was being subjected to a test to see if he could RP villians well or not. Now, I must admit, I did mess up, but to explain how, I'm going to include the DM I got from player X\n\n\n\"im still waiting for your permission to continue my plot in the magic academy area, can I?\"\u00a0\n\n\nNow, I didn't want to make a scene so I simply said no he couldn't without giving my reasons, because usually when I do, that starts an argument. So I told him no as politely as I could, in hopes that maybe he'd DM me again to ask why?\u00a0\n\n\nNo, he went and decided it would be best to just pull his Characters from my realms, simply because I would not allow him to do one storyline he pleased, effectively ending several other plots that were unrelated to this plotline and the Character I had issues with.\n\n\nNow I want to confess, I messed up in 2 ways,\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n1: I failed to ask which plotline player X wanted to continue, however, the plotline with Pyunupp ((see my second Reddit post for information on this plot and Character)) was the only one on hold.\u00a0\n\n\n2: I failed to give player X the results of his villian test, this was definitely a mess up on my end and I may have been too hasty with player X, but I do want to say, in my defense, I was undecided on the verdict of the Villian test because player X never controlled a villian directly during it, and there were not combat scenes during it, and these occasions are when player X usually pulls his dirty tricks ((more on those at the bottom if you don't want to read my 2 long posts)) plus, if you read the DM player X sent me, he didn't remind me to give the results of the Villian test and just asked to continue his plotline, but still, this was a mess up on my end,\u00a0\n\n\nNow in this server, most of the player's have their own realms that they control and can generally decide on if Characters are allowed in or not and can kick Characters out of their realms if they are troublesome. Shortly after I told Player X no, he could not do this plotline, I got 2 DMs from the server admin, This is what he said to me:\n\n\nyou have absolutely zero right to tell 'Player X' what he can and cannot do - or anyone else, for that matter. That is my business and mine alone.\n\nThis isn't about justice anymore. Not only are you borderline incapable of moving on from the past, you're paranoid to a fault.\n\n\nNow I won't deny, the Server admin is right about my paranoia, but the problem I have is that he knows about all the complaints I have lodged against Player X, and that some of the other players stand by me, but he hasn't issued player X even a single warning for his actions, but the moment I come out and say that I don't trust Player X in my realms because of all the things he's done in the past, the Server admin is is quick to slam me down and override my judgment and it seems he is completely ignoring my complaints about player X,\u00a0\n\n\nNow, if you want more details about player X, please DM me, or read the the prior posts, but here is a bullet point list of my complaints about Player X, I'm pretty sure I've shared all of them with the Server admin at this point. Some may be irrelevant because they were in player X's own server and RPs but I'm leaving them in as they may connect to the problems I have with player X in the communal RP\n\n\nIn the communal RP:\n\n\n-ignored the communal Character sheet in various ways, including not putting Characters on there before combat, hiding information ((admittedly just their ages)) in white text, and being very vauge with his Character's abilities\n\n\n-admitted to owning a private Character sheet that he didn't give us access to,\u00a0\n\n\n- in one instance, had his villian appear out of nowhere, ignoring any and all detection abilities other Characters may have had, to snatch up the souls she needed from 3 powerful beings to powerful their own artifact.\u00a0\n\n\n-granted one of his villians New abilities mid combat to counter the abilities that were being used against them, then tried to blow up a location important to a lot of plotlines when he was losing still,\n\n\n- tried to set rules for other people's Characters, then break them himself. his villian is allowed to damage people's souls by defeating them in combat, but our Characters aren't allowed to repair the damaged souls unless they extensively know the Character in question. With no justification as to why is villian was so powerful,\u00a0\n\n\n-\u00a0 after 2 of this same villian's hencemen were captured and Incarcerated, player X had the Villian reclaim these 2 hencemen via a battle that happened entierly off screen between 2 sets of his own Characters.\n\n\n- if he doesn't get his way, he guilt trips the players until they give in. This has resulted in myself and the other major player taking temporary leaves from the server in the past.\n\n\nOn his own server/ in his own RPs\n\n\n-bastardizes player Characters to suit his needs, making them incapable of doing anything if they go against his plotlines\n\n\n- refused to even let me tell him what kind of abilities and equipment my Character should of had after a 1 year timeskip because it would of been favoratism, but was perfectly happy to let another player be a fairy and gave them a broken spell combination that allowed them to metagame by allowing them to see what other players were doing and craft illusions against them\n\n\n-without warning, had his supposedly friendly NPCs tie up my character, potentally with no fair chance to fight back, as he admitted to god-modding the final boss and therefore could of been forging the dice rolls here too. He also refused to listen to any of my explinations on why this shouldn't be possible\n\n\n-deleated a post of mine in his own server when I called him out for what he did to may Character in his previous RP when it looked like he might try to do the same thing in another RP.\n\n\n-using in universe forces giving his own Characters abilities that would allow them to instantly defeat wayward player Characters and force them back onto the the intended plot\n\n\n- against enemies, had almost everything player Characters do fail unless they do exactly as his NPCs tell them, and doesn't allow them to figure the solution out themselves or find alternate solutions to battles\n\n\n- never gives any clues or indications of what villians can do before the battle happens, while his NPCs sometimes do know in advance. Potentally leading to them pulling cheap shots on the players,\n\n\n- has had a villian's weakness be counter intuitive, in a battle between 2 players and evil twins, one with ice powers and one with fire powers that were weak to each other's powers, as soon as a player broke through the snowdome that the twins were in, that player was immediately countered by a fire pillar.\u00a0\n\n\n- imported a Character of mine he knows from a previous RP, while we were still doing negotiations for how her powers should be adapted, then expecting me to use a powerset he had divided that included a weakness the Character doesn't have that he could easily exploit for plot purposes. Was also unwilling to try and find a compromise that would suit us both and likely shut down the RP as a result, even though I offered to change Characters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny time Player X is confronted, he often deflects the criticisms and doesn't seem to take them seriously, he usually opts to brush them off because they happened ages ago and claims they are irrelevant because of this, but he has also deleted a post where I called him out on having his friendly NPC tie up my character when it looked like he was setting up for the same thing to happen again in another of his RPs. On the communal server, he usually manipulates the other members into turning against anyone who Denies him his plotlines and his actions have caused both me and the other major player to temporarily quit the server. And while his has promised to change his ways and has been doing so for the past year, we have seen very few signs of improvement in regards to his actions and he has even committed some of the listed offences after making these promises to change.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo\u2026 given that the Server admin has ignored the complaints about Player X, and I have basically been told to let Player X have his way in my realms, should I stick around or leave the server? And should I give Player X any more chances if I stick around?\n\nFeel free to ask me anything, elaborate on your feelings or throw criticisms my way in the comments\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/hcv4d7)",

            "selftext": "I saw this sub and I immediately knew I had to join because I have a couple of stories I could tell. I think I\u2019m going to start with probably my worst one...\n\nI joined this one site after a while of not rping. I think I found it via just Googling \u201croleplay site\u201d. I clicked the first one and I was hooked. Everybody on the site was incredibly welcoming and nice. It was my first site rp site as we know of them these days. I was so excited to get started because most of the people I had written with prior had been younger than me and these people were older. It was really nice not to be the oldest person in the cbox for a change. \n\nSo after a while of getting comfortable with people, I ended up friending a couple of them on Facebook so we can plot privately on Messenger and mark group chats. I felt really good about this group of people. A couple in particular I shared things about my personal life with. \n\nNow something I think is important to know here is that I don\u2019t trust people very easily. It\u2019s extremely hard for me to open up to people and tell them personal things. One of the people I became really close with ended up not being who they said they were. We\u2019ll call her \u2018Kay\u2019. Kay was a college student getting her masters degree in Japan. She had a roommate we\u2019ll call \u2018Matt\u2019. They were really good friends and he was also on the site. I really liked Kay. I told her plenty of things about myself, but she was also a liar. \n\nOne day I was driving home from a college class when my phone began to blow up. I was stopped at a light and I briefly glanced and saw some things, but I wasn\u2019t able to read it all till I got home. Kay wasn\u2019t Kay as all. She was a he. He lied about every. He came out saying that since people just assumed he was a woman because his first character was a woman he decided he would go with it. He created an entire female persona as a social experiment to see how long he could keep it up and fool people. He created a fake FB page using the pictures of one of his best friends who agreed to let him use her photos for this little social experiment. Not only did he lie about himself, he also lied about the friend Matt. He was also Matt. So not only was he fake, he also had a fake friend. \n\nI was shocked. I felt so betrayed. I was hurt and distraught. What came next was utterly shocking in my opinion. Everybody else who was in that chat was OKAY with this kind of behavior. They told him that it was alright and that they would still be his friend. We\u2019ll now call this person \u2018Fred\u2019. Nobody cared that this person had lied to everybody and basically catfished us, making me the odd one out. Everybody thought I was weird, but I didn\u2019t let that influence how I felt. Fred messaged me saying he was sorry that I was upset and that he was still the same person as Kay and that we could still be friends. I told him we would absolutely not be friends like we had been and that he had lost all my respect and trust for lying like he did. He said he was sad, but he understood and that he never meant to hurt anybody. However he did and I never forgave him. \n\nI remained on that site until it was closed. Fred left because he simply didn\u2019t have the time to write anymore and I was glad. I never wrote with him again. But like I said, that site closed and I was asked by the head admin of that site to help create another site. You\u2019re probably wondering how I could stand to stay with some of the same people who accepted Fred for the liar he was. Well, I just really loved the other people and I adored the plots I had with them. Sometimes you just can\u2019t walk away plots you love. Maybe it\u2019s silly, but personally couldn\u2019t do it and start over. Especially since it was my first real RP site. \n\nAnyways, after a while Fred showed up because he was sent a link by the head admin. My plan was to be kind in the cbox and just ignore him otherwise. He tried to chat with me in DM, but I just kind of shrugged him off. He kind of died off after a little while anyways so it was whatever. And I haven\u2019t heard from him since. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that was really wordy, but I had to tell the whole thing. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Have a good one.",

            "selftext": "Roleplay. It\u2019s a wonderful hobby and pastime that many people engage. whether it\u2019s to indulge in some awesome story telling or to practice writing skills, roleplay is an enjoyable activity for all those who like to delve into it. Unfortunately like any hobby roleplay has it\u2019s annoying moments whether it be writers block, lazy partners or suddenly finding that your free time has gone out of the window. What I\u2019ll be talking about today is the most important requirement you need to rp: another human being.\n\nRp partners come in all different styles. From first person to third and from paragraphs to one liners there\u2019s normally an rper and an rp style to suit just about anyone. The only problem is finding someone who suits the checklist you have that one must tick all or a majority of the boxes of requirements you have for you to consider them a potential partner. Unfortunately sometimes all those who tick the boxes might turn out to be what you dread the most. There\u2019s so many things so in order to prevent this from becoming a full blown essay, I\u2019ve picked out the things that annoy me the most whenever I\u2019m approached by potential partners or approaching someone else.\n\nKnowing the gender of whose behind the screen being more important than the rp: \n\nin any ad I\u2019ve ever posted I\u2019ve never mentioned my gender for many reasons (disclosing it to rp partners in pms when answering to other people\u2019s ad\u2019s is a different matter of course). The main reason is that it\u2019s really no ones business as to what I am yet every now and then I\u2019ll be confronted by someone whose first words are \u201care you f/m? I\u2019m straight and therefore can only rp with someone the opposite gender to me.\u201d. This creeps me out really, mainly because there\u2019s very few rp related reasons that one might actually want to know someone\u2019s real gender. I also find it ridiculous that people reach out to people who put A4A in their ads only to turn them away because they\u2019re not the gender they\u2019re sexually attracted to in real life. If you\u2019re someone who looks specifically for male or female partners and answer an ad where the poster\u2019s gender is not specified then do not pull a shocked pikachu and be rude if they\u2019re not your preferred gender. I understand Being a dude rping against another dude might make you uncomfortable but no one is forcing you to rp with them.\n\nPeople who ignore the fact you don\u2019t double and try to use it as a bargaining chip:\n\nI don\u2019t double. I see no point to it and in almost, if not every case, of doubling I\u2019ve agreed to do I\u2019ve found that my partner does not give back what they take and spend time and effort only on their romantic pairing. All too often I get people who tell me they\u2019ve seen I don\u2019t double yet try to convince me that they won\u2019t be like all the other doublers who\u2019ve cheated me of what we\u2019d agreed on. It\u2019s a waste of time to double.\n\n\nControlling my characters:\n\nThis is something that makes my blood boil in a very unhealthy way. No matter how many times I say it, there\u2019s always someone trying to control or dictate the actions of my character. The frustration of having to rewrite every sentence to try and give my partner a response is not worth the effort. Unfortunately, as most people who have been in this situation will find, the people who control other people\u2019s characters tend to either not care, get upset themselves when you try to point it out or promise that they won\u2019t do it again only to do it yet again. My characters are not yours to control. What my character feels/hears/sees/thinks/does is not up for others to decide. I find it somewhat ironic that people who say don\u2019t control their characters often write paragraphs of your character doing stuff.\n\nWrongly labelling what my character is:\n\nI play non human characters, mostly aliens or alien hybrids. It\u2019s not fun being a human rping a human in a fictional world whether it be realistic or not. I also tend to avoid the stereotype of the blue skinned or pointy eared but otherwise very much the same as an ordinary human humanoid alien. Unfortunately this often ends up with my character being labelled as an anthro or a furry. Personally I have nothing wrong with either of this things but that does not mean I want people insisting that is what my character is. Zootopia is an entire movie about anthro\u2019s yet no one goes \u201c*gasp!* furry!\u201d But a character who has fur because of the climate of their planet is automatically considered one (it\u2019s not. Really it is not). I always warn people that I don\u2019t rp as the average generic humanoid many people think of when they see the word alien and nine times outta ten I\u2019ll get a \u201coh it\u2019s totally fine :)\u201d only to either be blocked when I send the ref or told my character is a furry and I therefor cannot be rped with. Same happens when I\u2019m the one posting an ad, I\u2019ll get people who\u2019ve claimed to have read it yet told that they can\u2019t rp with me because they think my character is a furry yet find that a lizard alien from mass effect is totally okay by them. It\u2019s a big wtf moment all around.\n\nGender pairing stereotypes:\n\nI think everyone should know what I mean by this. In m/f pairings the man must be devoid of any emotion, rough, muscled, hung, borderline abusive and know everything about relationships whilst the woman must be a petite,busty/curvy, blonde, horrifically abused by everyone, be overly emotional and a virgin who has never even done anything romantic in their life. If you think that sounds bad I can reassure you it\u2019s not just m/f pairings. m/m and f/f pairings often follow the annoying stereotype of the characters entire personality revolving around who does what in the bedroom. Tops are always freakishly tall, dark,rapey, overly masculine (in both gay and lesbian pairings), treat their partner as nothing but an object and always rude. Bottoms are always tiny beyond reason, overly feminine (again, in both gay and lesbian pairings), look like and sound like they\u2019ve never hit puberty, have some overly tragic back story, are unable to do anything without the tops permission and act like terrified twelve year olds when it comes to smutty stuff. Guess what people? Y\u2019all don\u2019t have to act like that nor make that your character\u2019s personality. Tops can be submissive and bottoms can be dominant. Did you know that you can also switch positions to keep it interesting? No? Okay.\n\nPeople who apply real life logic to fictional aspects of an rp:\n\nWhat? My character can\u2019t be a hybrid because humans and chimpanzees can\u2019t have babies so therefore that same principal must apply to them? Uh....yes they can, mainly cause it\u2019s a fictional character in a fictional setting. This sorta ties in with the controlling character thing, saying your character cannot be something just because of a real life fact of biology shouldn\u2019t apply to something that\u2019s not yours. Let people be whatever without ruining their fun just so you can flaunt your degree in biology. \n\nI think I\u2019d better stop here before it gets too long. Anyways folks hope you enjoy this little rant/guide/ whatever you want to perceive it as. Feel free to leave your biggest rp annoyances in the comments as well.",

            "selftext": "My roleplays are heavily action-based, and they're also original content/character only. This particular instance happened a while ago, but I still look back and laugh over it. \n\nLong story short, one of my characters rules over a kingdom of soul-reaping entities who ensure that the souls of mortals pass on to the afterlife. There are plenty of threats to the kingdom that they face, and this was one such issue they had to take care of. My partner played as two of her own characters, both Mary Sues. One was good and the other was evil. I knew they were Mary Sues the moment their backstories were explained to me in several paragraphs, all with about a dozen tragic events that happened in their lives. One included being eaten by mermaids or something (???), if I recall correctly. \n\nNot only that, but they were both insanely powerful. As in, the evil one created a plague out of nowhere to sweep over the entire kingdom, and the good one was the only one with the cure, despite there never being a plague like this in history. However, I couldn't exactly complain about godmodding, because I had a few rather powerful characters in the roleplay as well. Since the roleplay was action-based, I wanted to have one of my characters go after the evil Mary Sue, but my partner told me OOC that it would be impossible to find her. So there we were, in a roleplay meant to be an action-based roleplay, and there had been next to no action. \n\nAfter the Mary Sue on the \"good guys side\" fit literally hundreds of thousands of people into her apartment on a different world and cured and fed them all, they went back into the city in the kingdom. All the while, the king of the kingdom (my character) had been left on the backburner because my partner insisted that he wasn't powerful enough to take on the evil Mary Sue. Keep in mind, the motives of the evil Mary Sue were never explained. She was just evil and wanted to kill everyone just because she could. \n\nI'm getting a bit peeved at this point, because it'd just been two Mary Sues popping back and forth, with one of them explaining how tragic their childhood was while the other tried killing an entire kingdom without reason. I asked if we could abandon the roleplay (I didn't want to be rude, since my partner wasn't a bad person), as it wasn't going anywhere. My partner insisted that we continued because she decided to have her Mary Sue catch interest in one of my characters. Her Mary Sue was about 17, and the character she wanted to ship with was a few centuries old, with his mental and physical age being around 30. I told her \"in your dreams,\" and again, requested that we ditch the roleplay. After all, by that point, it was just a massive sob story revolving around one character. \n\nNow that she realized I wasn't having any of this pity party or pedophilia crap when we originally agreed to have a heavily action-based roleplay, she decided to have our first actual fight between characters in the roleplay. I'm sitting here, relieved, thinking we were getting somewhere. I picked out a couple characters to fight the evil Mary Sue, but nope. Both of the Mary Sues ended up fighting each other, and my partner made it very clear that if any if my characters were to get involved in the fight, they would immediately die. I'm strongly against auto-killing, but I decided to entertain her, since she obviously wanted to continue going with the roleplay. I just had my characters watch, but it was about 20 responses of my partner just roleplaying with herself. I had my characters leave the battlefield to go do their own thing. My partner just had her two Mary Sues fighting for the next 20-30 responses while I just kept sending something along the lines of, \"Nobody was watching anymore because they got bored.\" There wasn't even a time skip, she just kept roleplaying with herself as her two Mary Sues fought each other. \n\nThen the evil Mary Sue was about to defeat the good Mary Sue in battle, and I figured my partner wanted one of my characters to jump in. This assumption would prove to be a massive waste of my time, because all of a sudden, Sans appeared to take down the evil Mary Sue. Yes, Sans from that one lovely game. For some reason, back then, this was the last straw for me, and I told her she had broken pretty much all of the rules of the roleplay. They were extremely simple, and I still remember them because I still use the same rules for some of my roleplays today. Instead of asking to abandon the roleplay, I just told her I was going to drop it, and I deleted the roleplay. \n\nTl;dr: Roleplay partner and I wanted an action roleplay. It turned into a sobstory where an evil Mary Sue tries to kill an entire kingdom for no reason while the other Mary Sue complains about her childhood, my characters aren't allowed to go after the evil Mary Sue, and then Sans shows up.",

            "selftext": "Many moons ago, I loved Warrior Cats. They were my absolute favorite. I read a lot of the books and only stopped because the author did something I didn\u2019t agree with to a character. \n\nAnyways. \n\nI was on this virtual pet site when I saw an ad for a Warriors RP and I was all for it. I had done it before on a large scale and it wasn\u2019t super fun because it was just so complicated. Being on a site where it was the sole focus sounded doable. So I joined and things were great! I was able to bring to life old characters that I loved. I had plots out the wazoo. I became good friends with some of those people. Most of them were younger than me which was fine at the time. It just got to be a bit much because there was a bunch of drama and people wanted me to side with them. I just wanted to write. I didn\u2019t care much to get involved in younger people drama. For reference I was probably 16-17 and these kids were definitely more along the lines of 12-13. I just couldn\u2019t be bothered. \n\nAnyways, we always site hopped together, closing old sites when people were bored and opened new ones. They were always Warriors in theme tho just with different concepts. So the head honcho of our group, I\u2019ll call her Amy, was always the one who made the site and myself and her real life bff, we\u2019ll call Sam, were always a mod or admin. This cycle happened all the time. We\u2019d pick up, move, create a new site and so on. \n\nAt one point, we were all happy and on a site. It was probs our best one yet. I had some plots I really loved. What happened next was crazy. One day the site was just gone. Everything was just deleted and there was no way of getting it back. Amy, Sam, and I were on this wild goose chase, trying to figure out what happened, but we all came up empty. We came to the conclusion that we must have been hacked. I was probably the most disappointed because I was really happy there. Amy eventually said she wanted a break and I was fine with that. At some point after I was talking to Sam and saying how crazy it was that the site just up and disappeared. \n\nWELL.\n\nSam said \u201cOh. You didn\u2019t know? Amy just deleted it on her own.\u201d I was shocked. It was after that I deleted both Sam and Amy. Because obviously Sam did care that her crazy friend had deleted all our fun for no reason other than she wanted to. I told all the friends I cared about what happened and we decided to make a site of our own. Amy was furious about this which was funny because she didn\u2019t care that she had deleted something we all worked hard on, but the moment I took some friends and did something on my she lost her mind. Well she went and made this huge Warriors site that was super successful and she made sure ours failed, telling people we were horrible and mean and they believed her. Our site never took off. It just kind of died and that was the end of my Warriors RP career and me writing with people much younger than myself. \n\nNow I say this, but there are people younger than myself on my current site. I guess when I say this I mean literal children. I\u2019m sure there are people who have had different experiences than myself, but I just can\u2019t stand the drama. Which there is definitely drama with all adults, but it\u2019s different. I can tell off another adult. I can\u2019t tell off a child. XDD",

It's not that I'm overthinking things it's that they refuse to think at all, aside from creating characters exclusively to force into relationships.\n\nAll I ask for is just basic information as the most we'll get for an area is scenery. Want to know the ruler of a kingdom? Sorry, only two of the kingdoms have a named ruler and those are both the admin's characters. I even created and fleshed out an entire area run by vampires within their paper thin lore and while it was allowed it will not be considered canon.\n\nThe final straw was when one of the gods crusaded throughout the world fighting against what they deemed was sin (and yes the gods are pcs and yes it is both as bad as you think and not as nothing ever matters).\n\nLong story short they god was defeated and everything went back to normal. Yes that is right all the destruction and death they should have caused did not happen. The world was already \"rebuilding\" from the last world ending threat and this god thinks it's a great idea to cause more destruction and violence. Now you would think that crusading throughout an already wrecked world have some sort of consequences for the god and the world, nope, in fact, the event ended as if the god was the victim for just trying to make the world a better place by force.\n\nSo while I did not partake in the event as I saw that it was a trash fire in the making. I however at this time was still naive and optimistic in trying to have the world change and react to our actions to create more plot hooks and stories and asked questions on how it affected the world. As I asked my questions on how the kingdoms and the economy would react they dismissed my questions saying that no one cares about the economy and the kingdoms can not do anything to a god. (Also got a 24h ban as apparently asking questions and explaining why the questions made sense was arguing with a mod as yes, of course, all the mods are friends and gods. Though their selective enforcement of the rules is a story for another time).\n\nAnyway not to get off topic the state of the site is now mostly the mods and admins making characters to ship with and skipping all of their would be struggles to have said relationships as they forgot the basic rules of show don't tell and that the journey is what makes the story.\n\nThough as for me I was waiting on two others who I was in the middle of writing with, but they left either due to seeing what I see or life stuff. Another thread was ignored for reasons I do not understand as we left a friend unavenged though the player does not seem to mind as they have gone on to do pointless filler threads.\n\nPerhaps it is me and maybe I should stop caring and learn to love the bomb and make tons of nothing characters to prance around with or move on.",

            "selftext": "I have two situations that seem to be reoccurring as of lately, to a chronic degree. \n\nThe first one, which has been evident for quite some time, is that a seemingly large number of individuals just don't wish to play males and expect the other person to take on that role (in these instances, I happen to be the other person). Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy playing males, but it becomes exhausting rather quickly. This week I made a post containing a plot in which I stated that I would like to play the female role and for anyone who wishes to play the male to message me. Apparently some people either really lack reading comprehension or blatantly refuse to acknowledge that part of the post, because every person who inquired about the plot said that they're interested in playing f or that they have a great f character for the plot. Someone even got pissed that I told them I want to play the female (in the plot I created...) and went on a rant about how they cannot play males due to a traumatic experience they had whilst playing one, which okay that sucks but that's not my problem. \n\nThe second issue seems to be that no one (SEEMINGLY, I know that there are people who do), appears to want to take initiative and guide the plot a little. It sucks being the person that consistently provides these lengthy paragraphs and only receiving a few snippets in return because they expect you to guide you both into the next scene. Why is this such a common occurrence? Is this just laziness or is it lack of creativity? I notice that often this comes up when people don't have strong characters and so, therefore, they don't have a lot to bring to the table with said characters. That's its own dilemma that's also disheartening. \n\nI'm by no means the perfect roleplayer or story creator, but it's hard to improve when one only runs into these types of individuals in the community. Does anyone else have similar experiences?",

            "selftext": "This story is fairly recent so yeah.\n\nA girl came into one of my main RP groups, which happens to be based on Percy Jackson and the Olympians. One of the well known facts is that Hera is completely devoted to her marriage Zeus, despite his own long list of affairs.\n\nSo what does she want?\n\nA daughter of Hera. That can read minds. The mods are confused and trying to talk her down, but she was adamant so they reluctantly let her proceed as a self titled Princess. They try to give most people a chance to be nice but kept a close eye on her.\n\nAlmost immediately, she began scouting for ships for her special princess, but enunciates in RP that the character finds herself to be insecure and unattractive, despite how much she praises her character's looks on the main channels. Yeah, she wanted the character that felt unattractive but could still pull any man like she was a protagonist in a YA novel.\n\nShe threw a fit and the fact that she and her character were both minors, but she wanted to ship with some adult characters or members that expressed discomfort multiple times at shipping with a minor, especially when our server isn't ship oriented. Plus, she admitted that she enjoys ERP (erotic roleplay) so that immediately put a lot of us on edge. She also messaged another member about shipping with a character the other member was still in the process of making. Didn't even have a name yet and she already wanted dibs??\n\nShe didn't like the fact that the Hera cabin, which was mostly a shrine and canonly made to appease Hera, wasn't redone for her to live in, despite her making it clear that her character wasn't even supposed to even be born. When told her character would be placed in the Hermes cabin, she made it obvious on the main channels and in the RP that she didn't like it.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve always been invested in bad guys. Or people  who do bad things for a productive look. I\u2019m even as of now writing a novel basing how dictatorship over every individual country done right can lead to a profitable human race. Regardless, I have had many instances where I\u2019ve played an asshole, or a villain and have had my own individual self chewed out, even when I had a innocent character. Like here\u2019s one example\n\nI was apart of a Vietnam War RP, it aimed to be very realistic and detailed to write something like actual combat scenarios. I knew this was already off because a 3rd of the platoon where women, which I thought was alright. But when they where put into high ranking positions I knew the leaders where raging over the females in the server. Either way I made a African American soldier, because at the time during the war there were African American men fighting for their rights. So I made this character and I vaguely remember how it went, He goes to the commanding officer. Gets to know him. Meets his squad. Goes to bed. Next day He gets up and notices the platoon sergeant and a Private are doing \u2018funny\u2019 business in their tent. He doesn\u2019t mind it until he sees a man get killed in front of his eyes due to the lack of attention the two where giving to their environment. He reports it to the platoon commander, platoon commander tasks my character to spy on the two. Now this is when I started to get insults about my character even when I was trying to have a decent conversation with people. But no. All this nonsense about how my character sucks and how he should rot in hell. I continued the role play nonetheless and soon enough by character gets death threats for no reason. Meta gaming. No one knew about what my character was doing. And it all went by fine. Because the owners characters relationship with a females characters relationship was going to end. So he had a hissy fit with me and I kept explaining to him about metagaming and how the rp didn\u2019t make sense in the first place. And I was kicked.\n\nI\u2019ve had multiple instances and it\u2019s all made me thought. What\u2019s the point in rping? I thought that it might be to others to create a vivid story. To me it\u2019s building characters in the right way and seeing them interact with one another. That why I never right an amazing backstory. Because these characters need to make a name for themselves in rp.",

            "selftext": "Second post of the day but it\u2019s a question that has to be asked: why do so many people think that having a character with a tragic backstory makes a character inherently interesting? What\u2019s wrong with being raised in a regular ol\u2019 family? \n\nI am thinking of one partner in particular who doesn\u2019t have a SINGLE character where the family structure isn\u2019t broken in some way. If she makes a character, rest assured that, like clockwork the character will come from a fucked up family dynamic once she creates it. Here\u2019s a non-comprehensive list of some of these backstories: \n\n- character got emancipated at 17 for...some reason. Reason(s) why judges granted this still are unclear. \n- character\u2019s dad ran off and mom was negligent, didn\u2019t care that character\u2019s uncle forced himself on her and blamed her when he got busted. \n- character\u2019s family was fine until lil brother drowned in a lake and then the dad ran off and got married with some nasty hag of a southern woman. \n- character got taken in by grandparents after mom committed suicide, dad never in the picture.\n- character\u2019s mom died, lives with abuse asshole dad who is into illegal shit. \n- character\u2019s parents died in a car wreck, don\u2019t know who took her in. \n\nThere are more of these examples that I just can\u2019t think of at the moment but the question remains the same: do people just think that a character needs a tragic backstory in order to be interesting? I get that there\u2019s no such thing as the perfect family, but when time after time your main defining characteristic is that you\u2019ve gone through family trauma as a child that bleeds over into your characteristics today, I don\u2019t think that makes for a strong character.",

I posted RPs, and I was doing a 1x1 rp with some guy. It was based off of Dragon Ball Super, and it was great in the beginning, but things took a turn. \n\n\nSo we RPed a lot, but soon the guy replied to me like once every week, and I'd check in saying (Hey, everything okay?) You know, just to be friendly. And he kept using the same excuse over and over, \"oh it's just school\", and I understood, but the rp went into the summer and this still was happening. It was really annoying since I was in LOVE with the rp, and eventually he deleted his account without a reason or warning.",

            "selftext": "Here's my male OC. His name is Heaven and he was raised as the only male in an all-female brothel: first as an errand boy, and now as the top-billing courtesan. As a result he's learned to mimic female speech and body language perfectly. He doesn't walk, he sashays, swinging his hips from side to side in a mesmerizing rhythm that would drive any man crazy. He has full, pouting pink lips, a tiny waist, and silky long blonde hair that glows golden in the sun. He wears a revealing halter top and skirt that show off his slender, shapely legs. His curvaceous figure can be said to put the women he works with to shame. ;)\n\nBe forewarned, Heaven isn't very assertive! He's more comfortable being submissive and passive. (This is HIS preference, not mine. I'd make him more assertive if I could, but I just know he'd rebel and the muse would leave me! &gt;.&lt;) His favorite thing is to have a dominant man who takes care of him. He loves getting up early to cook breakfast for his man in a skimpy nightgown and heels. Nothing makes him feel prettier than being ravaged in a set of lingerie that draws attention to his subtle curves.\n\nAs far as sex, feel free to pretend that Heaven's *ahem* isn't there. He cares more about his partner's equipment anyway. ;) He likes his men to be, you know, hung. The bigger the better. There IS no \"too big\" when Heaven sees something he likes! And don't worry about consent, Heaven is ALWAYS ready for whatever a manly beast wants from him. He has a quirk in his DNA that allows him to self-lubricate, which is pretty awesome. ~.^",
