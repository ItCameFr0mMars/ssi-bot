            "selftext": "\nS\u00f3. I am in a discord server that I\u2019d like to roleplay in. And when I requested, someone immediately replied, saying they\u2019d like to roleplay. Of course, I was thrilled. \n\nKeep in mind, I\u2019m a female, but I normally like to roleplay as a male, for whatever reason. Besides, a lot of male roleplayers normally get more roleplay requests in most of the servers I\u2019ve been on. I\u2019m not sure why. \n\nSo of course, my OC was a guy. He was cold, a little moody, and definitely would take a while to soften up to. The roleplayer\u2019s Oc was a female. Buttttt-\n\nOkay. So you know those cringy Wattpad fanfictions that are like \u201cTaming the cat girl\u201d or something? Her OC was like that...\n\nThe OC had grown up in the woods. She had cat ears and a tail, and was \u2018feral\u2019 (?) \n\nThe roleplayer then said the plot for the roleplay. Which, surprise surprise, was the female OC finding my OC, who just happened to be casually loitering outside the forest at night. Not dodgy at all. My guy OC for some reason takes the cat girl home to \u2018teach her\u2019 or whatever.\n\nBut I wanted to give the roleplay a chance, even though I didn\u2019t like the plot line at all. Seemed very basic. But however, I went along with it.\n\nI really didn\u2019t like their style of roleplay. They immediately got snuggly with my OC, which is extremely unrealistic with the way his personality is and her OC\u2019s upbringing. I don\u2019t even know if she took that into account, or if she even read my OC submission. \n\nI unintentionally ghosted the roleplayer after the female oc trying to go home with my guy OC. I immediately became absorbed into far more intriguing roleplays, and slowly forgot about the one I had been doing.\n\nUntil a few days ago. I decided to message the server, asking if anyone wanted to roleplay. And hurrah; the same person I was roleplaying with previously messaged, saying:\n\n\u201cWe can continue our roleplay in DM, you know-\u201c\n\nI forgot who they were, so I kindly asked them to sum up what they were on about.\n\nThey said:\n\u201cRemember, she was gaining his trust. Besides...can you not ignore me- please..?\u201d \n\nExactly that. With all the \u201c...\u201d and all. I explained that I had been away for a while dealing with personal issues, and after coming back after having a break, I\u2019d forgotten entirely about the roleplay. Did I mention they always bombarded me with messages, to try to get me to roleplay with them? Mostly guilt trip ones.\n\nBut anyways, after saying that, they were replied:\n\u201cY-you still could of checked up on me and not ignored me...\u201d\n\nThis was annoying. So I said a little bolder that just because I didn\u2019t reply to them in the first hour or so, does not mean I ignored them, and that I had a busy life. They used a lot of \u201cI-I...\u201d and \u201co-oh\u201d stammering messages in normal DM. Which personally annoyed the hell out of me- xD\n\nBut they kept on at me to roleplay with me in DMs, guilt tripping me further. I said yes, because I honestly felt bad. The roleplay was as cliche as I remembered it to be. I immediately just left after they said something about their OC cuddling mine in their bed-? Like, hello? We have only met each other for a few hours. Like hell is my guy going to start snuggling you.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to reply to their messages now. I really don\u2019t like their roleplay style and ideas at all, and it makes me uncomfortable when they hint at trying out a sexual roleplay. (A kinky as hell one-) \nI\u2019m not sure how to shut them down. I\u2019ll just feel bad and awkward, and I want to prevent them from slagging me off openly in the server :,)\nI know for a fact they are around my age; a teen. At the least, a child still. But it\u2019s really uncomfortable notherless. Does anyone have any ideas to please help me out? I apologise for this long, whining message.",

            "selftext": "Hello hello. First of, I'm proud of myself! It's only been *five months* since my last post, [A Pure Plight of Respendent Reputation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/etelil/a_pure_plight_of_resplendent_reputation/), whereas it took me *six months* to write that one as the followup to my first  ever post here: [A Dishonest Duo of Malicious Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/cbzpof/a_dishonest_duo_of_malicious_moderators/). As you can see, I've really grown as a person!\n\nNow this is a story all about how life got flipped and turned upside down. Remember in my last post when I mentioned joining a new community whose owner suffers from wannabe-protagonist syndrome? Well, this story I'm about to share is sort of a precursor to that, featuring that same owner who I'll refer to as \"Flex\" to (hopefully) properly give an idea of the sort of person they were, in case my story fails to paint a good enough picture. Flex also had a bodyguard, who I'll just call \"Farmer\", due to their impractical-but-practical weapon of choice. There's me, of course. I was just sort of there in the background as usual, really just a glorified NPC if I'm being honest. Next on the rollcall is Pope, whom if it wasn't for them and one other person, Devil-kun, things would not have played out so perfectly. Finally, there's the person responsible for the ensuing chaos. This last person saw the events unfold and, in an absolute, unintended masterstroke, capitalized HEAVILY off of all that took place prior to his appearance. Even now, thinking back to what occured is making me laugh uncontrollably. This man, whose name subsequently became a term and an in-joke for characters who undergo a similar situation, is Xoron. There were others involved as well, but their contributions were so minimal that they really are more like side characters in this story-- just like me!\n\nAhem.\n\nThis tragedy(?) took place after the fall of Madness and Tranquility's hellish paradise-planet. The destruction wrought by Weeaboo had catapulted me through time and space until I wound up crashing face-first into a lush new, peaceful community overflowing with potential good times and sappy character arcs. I promptly made a new character and, after about two hours of hesitation, posted her to be scrutinized by the local Deities. Soon she was given the clear, and I slipped into her flesh and subjugated her consciousness so that I may explore this beautiful new setting.\n\nThe next day, demons attacked.\n\nStuff happened, and I used my talent for subterfuge and stealth to sneak into the demons' base and save several others that were trapped there. We escaped undetected, as a brave few were assaulting the floating island in this modern-fantasy setting with their futuristic jetplanes and making more of a ruckus than I did \"sneaking\" into the place. I later found out that those jetplanes were owned by Flex, who owned a massive estate overflowing with futuristic weapons, vehicles, a near-impenetrable barrier (near-impenetrable, because the Gods didn't approve of the thing being immune to everything despite Flex's complaints), and of course, infinite resources to make sure Flex could craft any and everything she needed to surmount any obstacle. Which was exactly what it was used for. I wanted to be on the obvious winning side of this conflict, and thus made my way to that estate alongside the fellows I rescued. I was allowed in, as Flex likely viewed my meek self as not much of a threat, plus one of the people I saved was apparently her sister or something.\n\nFast forward another day or two, and the continent was an absolute wreck. Meanwhile, our Heroes\\[sic\\] remained behind the safety of the estate's barrier and a hundred or so huge sci-fi guns that shot down everything hostile that came near. Suddenly, Pope appeared outside the barrier! Pope was basically a Giga Priest, in that his whole deal was smiting demons. He also stole powers from divine beings to further his own selfish goals but hey, in this instance he was the *good* guy. Pope requested entry into the estate and was subsequently allowed entry, as Pope was also good with words. Farmer didn't trust Pope though, for some reason I couldn't imagine. Now, Pope brought with him news that would have been alarming if Flex's super telescopes didn't already alert her to it: the demons were heading right for the estate. Now Pope, much like (I imagine), everyone else in that room very much did not wish to die horribly, and thus offered to sanctify the whole estate to bar the demons from entry even more absolutely. Everyone agreed with this course of action, and thus Pope begun the lengthy chant.\n\nA chant that Flex and Farmer sought to interrupt.\n\nApparently, they thought the chanting was too ominous and they didn't trust Pope. A bit odd, since Flex was the one who allowed him inside, but whatever, I kept quiet. Devil-kun, whom I completely forgot existed, *didn't* keep quiet. Being a demon lord, he obviously couldn't just stand by and sprang into action... to ensure Pope finished the chant, because he wanted to see what would happen. Devil-kun liked to do things purely for laughs; harmless things that contradicted his status and appearance solely because he found them funny. To be honest, I was impressed Devil-kun was able to fend off both Flex and Farmer, especially since the latter's weapon could apparently cut through literally anything. ***Anything.*** There were other people there too, but they were either asleep or didn't care about the life or death struggle going on a few feet away. Huh? You want to know why *I* didn't intervene? Surely if the conflict was so serious, I should have picked a side and fought as well? Nonsense! Why should I throw my life away like that?! Besides, if worst came to worst, I could have-- and did, by the way-- just slinked away in the ensuing chaos. So anyway, the chant succeeded, and the estate was bathed in infinite holy power until the God the power was being stolen from died-- and as you could probably imagine, killing a God isn't that easy. So now the group had all the time in the world to plan their counterattack against the demons, and they did just that! That is, until Xoron drew near.\n\nHere's the funny thing about Xoron: he wasn't a demon, so he was unaffected by the holy energies flowing through the estate. He was able to teleport, so the regular barrier failed to stop him from coming in (much to Flex's chagrin). He wasn't a good guy, so his appearance was very bad news, and-- here's the imporant part-- ***he*** ***absorbed and assimilated energy in order to get stronger***.\n\nSo, Xoron took one step onto the estate's hallowed grounds and became invincible.\n\nWhen Xoron first appeared, he was a frail-looking, skeletal being that looked very much like something that shouldn't even be alive, with a voice that sounded beyond unpleasant. When he let Jesus into his heart however, he became a hulking monstrosity the size of a mountain with a voice that could be heard for miles. The estate was promptly smashed, but everybody survived because of course they did (personally, I fled the second I realized just how bad things were about to get-- which was a realization that came to me rather quick, mind you). Devil-kun, Pope, and even Xoron spent a good while laughing at what had just unfolded, half-assed a fight, then the former two opened up a dimensional portal or something and left Xoron to wipe out all life on the planet. I stole one of Flex's spaceships and bailed. I suppose my presence was so minor that Xoron failed entirely to notice my escape. Or he just didn't care. Absolutely none of what occurred was planned beforehand to reach this conclusion. I know, as I made sure to ask those involved, as well as shared more than a few laughs with them (not Flex nor Farmer though, as they were angry for a long while).\n\nAnd that's how Xoron, through a series of complete coincidences and the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, gained God-like power and crushed his enemies, then became the term for characters who gain insane power boosts thanks to a series of complete coincidences in that little community. As you can imagine, Flex and Farmer weren't happy. Their spirits spent a good while screeching to the Deities--whom were too busy laughing at the TPK that had just occurred to listen-- for a do-over. I suppose that after this, Flex founded that other community to ensure that she no longer had to worry about That Guy ruining her super-special invincible future estate, as she later ragequit.\n\nHer efforts were in vain.",

They were protectors of magic and each had flaws and their own personalities, this rp was a free roam type of thing just a chat and you just rp. me and Jack were the only people who rped at the time but some people joined here and there. But we made it clear that there is a village  and a city with a huge forest inbetweeen them. The city was not protected by magic the Village was.\n\nBasically for the village you need to either be one of the ten of this magic protector group\n\nOr have a special necklace that is connected to the barrier and the owners heart beat. Once the owner dies so does the necklace. The only way to revive a necklace is to be inside the barrier and have it on for five years meaning five year old can go play outside the barrier(with their parents),  this will be important later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin the rp four of the my characters are also known as the children of Hades and Persephone, op? maybe but i gave them their flaws and gave limit to their powers (each have two that relate to their element and all have back draws)i based it off of the mythology that when Persephone goes to visit Hades, Demeter (Persephone's' mom) gets sad and weather gets colder.\n\nDuring this time the group celebrates at the village with something called the fall festival. It was set in two weeks (in rp days).\n\nIt was a very important time for my characters\n\nThe youngest of the siblings (her element was earth she can manipulate plants and shape shift) went around inviting peoples ocs (that she could get to) and random villages that are off the rp map.\n\nSo a lot of the ocs knew where the village was but also new that they all need to be let in by a puru which they will be at the destination before everyone showed up.\n\nduring the two week rp gap three other characters of mine were planning the festival, A demon A spirit person, And a cursed fox girl who was tired af. \n\nMe: \"Yeah that sounds excellent\" The spirit person said\n\nSara: \\*She was hiding and hugging her knees about to cry\\*\n\n(this went on for a while then)\n\nSara: Should i leave?//\n\nMe: Well I cant interact since I dont know where you are or how to get to you, where is your oc?//\n\nSara: That isn't important//\n\nMe: yeah it is if i dont know where your character is how am I suppose to know if I can interact or not//\n\nSara:\\*she hides under a bush with thorns\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point the demon boi and the spirit person were walking away from the house the cursed fox girl was in so she could rest. They were on their way back to their HQ .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSara:\\*she was bleeding from the thorns scratching her\\*\n\nMe:\\[has the two characters im using at the time tease each other\\]\n\nSara:\\*There was a loud scream across the forest\\*\n\nMe:I have my two ocs go check out what had happened and\n\nSara: \\*a dead body laid on the ground and I stood over it with blood dripping from my mouth, I see the two people and run\\*\n\nMe: The spirit person reaches down to the person whispering a spell Turing their body into ash and purifying their spirit so they can rest peacefully the ash melts into the ground creating a patch of poppies.\n\nThe demon boi looks at the spirit person \"Arent you afraid that creature will get in the village and ruin the festival?\"\n\nThe spirit person laughed as she looks to the demon and explains \"They can not enter that village, If this dead soul is a member of the village and that creature took their necklace the village still is safe, you cant resurrect a gem outside the barrier. Not to mention the gem is dead and wont let her in if they try to so dont worry\"\n\nSara:\\*Gets into village any way and attacks someones house\\*\n\nMe: Ok stop//\n\nSara: No//\n\nSara: Also my character is a she thank you very much//\n\nMe: I stated that you cant get into the village what about that did you not understand?//\n\nSara: So? My character needs blood to survive!//\n\nMe: Ok? And theres an unprotected city on the other side of the forest so you dont have to mess up plot points of the rp//\n\nSara: Well my character needs blood to survive they are a vampire//\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni left the chat out of frustration, i told jack and i told Host that I left and gave my reasoning. An hour past and I was ranting to me gf about the chat and they insisted that they'd rp with me to get my mind off of it and then I see that Host DMed me.\n\nhost: Hey I saw what you said and I banned Sara you can join back if you want \n\nthey put a link after they typed\n\nMe: Thanks so much\n\nAfter that me and my gf rped in the chat room and are still rping there to this day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if its to long or short your your reading standards, also if Chaos is reading this Hi you make me smile when i watch you uwu \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyway thanks for reading",

            "selftext": "I am so incredibly sick of going through all the formalities with someone. I'm sick of introductions, character bios, discussing terms, I'm sick of all of it, because it's a royal waste of time. It's especially annoying if you meet on one platform, they insist on moving to another to write, and they ghost or quit shortly after you give them your other social media. People are unapologetic time wasters. They're not worth it. Now I see why some just insist on jumping into writing.\n\n1. You'll see if they suck, immediately.\n2. You'll see if you're compatible right off the bat. \n3. You'll see if they actually want to write past a few paragraphs, or if they just have an idea in their heads  that they'll soon realize they can't properly express through their own writing.\n4. If they suck, you've only wasted a couple minutes as opposed to 30 or so.\n\n9 times out of 10, the person simply can't write. They're just awful and all they want is smut. How boring can one get?\n\nSometimes it's a dude who practically roleplays with himself and you're sitting there like \"why am I here?\"\n\nI know I may sound harsh but I'm not here to teach someone how to write or roleplay. I just wanted someone compatible and creative who won't ghost if there isn't constant sex in the role. Apparently that's too much to ask for these days.\n\nSorry for being angsty but I figured maybe some people could relate to this. I'm pretty much on the verge of giving up rp for a long while. It just isn't the same anymore. I'm working on a Space Pirate Novel instead... Lol",

            "selftext": "So it\u2019ll be three years ago at the end of July that I opened a site with some people. We were basically running away from plot blocking admins (a story for another time lol). So some of those who ended up as staff had never been an admin before. I\u2019ve been staff multiple times before so I felt good about myself as had two others. Two people hadn\u2019t, but enough of us were experienced so it felt like an even mix. \n\nSo from the start, this one person, we\u2019ll call her Bell, just ever so slightly got on my nerves and just rubbed me the wrong way. I don\u2019t know what it was at the time. I just had this gut feeling. She was very out there and tried too hard. I just went with it tho because I figured it was nothing. \n\nSo I\u2019m not much of a coder, but I can read it for the most part and manipulate it so I volunteered to help fixing up a skin as did Bell. I thought it would be great. I thought could really get to know her a bit and figure out why she just rubbed me the wrong way. Well, I quickly learned that everything she touched broke. There wasn\u2019t one thing she tried to finagle with that I had to go back in and fix and do myself. Which was really annoying cause it was more work for me. Eventually I just told her to stop doing things because she\u2019s making more work for me. After that came comments like \u201cOh I was told not to touch anything because I make more work blah blah blah.\u201d I mean, maybe I wasn\u2019t the nicest when I told her to stop touching stuff, but a girl could only take so much... also if the extent of your coding knowledge is changing hex codes, that\u2019s not coding. \n\nANYWAYS. \n\nWe proceeded to have more disagreements about coding and how things should look. Whenever she got upset she would run stomping to our head admin and cry like a child about how I was mean to her. She would also blame these temper tantrums on her mental illnesses... which, crying like a baby because someone is disagreeing with you isn\u2019t a mental illness? I mean, I\u2019m not a psychologist, but I think the two classes I took in college could help me come to that conclusion.  \n\nOnce the sit opened, we had less problems, but here and there she would just have these temper tantrums when things didn\u2019t go her way. I just didn\u2019t sign up to be someone\u2019s parent. \n\nWhen threads finally started happening, she asked me for a thread. To preface this, on our original site we had started a thread, but it didn\u2019t get far because we left. I really didn\u2019t want the thread, but I said yes because it felt like a quick thing. Her character was this wimpy delivery guy and my lady was this powerful business witch woman. She never would have been attracted to this guy, but I had a feeling Bell wanted a ship. And my feelings were right. Later on I had heard from a mutual friend (a fellow admin) that Bell was basically telling everybody how badly she wanted a ship with me and this character. To another person I heard that she was basically crying and panicking in her DMs about how I could possibly have a ship all planned out with someone else. However, she never expressed any of these feelings to me. Which I would have told her I wasn\u2019t interested because it just wouldn\u2019t work. But at the end of the end, if someone hadn\u2019t mentioned this to me, how was I supposed to know what she wanted? I\u2019m not a mind reader. We never finished the thread tho. I did that mean thing of forgetting about it then archiving it. I just wanted nothing to do with her brand of plotting. \n\nTime went by and things continued to happen. She would just explode about little things and blame it on her mental illness. It was always because things didn\u2019t go her way. At some point we began having issues with our head admin. I have the memories repressed to the point where I don\u2019t remember what originally happened, but randomly Bell started accusing him of horrible things that just never happened. Somethings we couldn\u2019t prove he hadn\u2019t done (things that happened off site and outside of Discord), but some things were so easy to prove false. Like things that happened in character. In the end, she resigned from her position as admin, but didn\u2019t quite leave. She wanted to take time for a LOA which we encouraged. I personally didn\u2019t think she would come back and she didn\u2019t. Six months went by and I had the pleasure of telling her that since she didn\u2019t know if she was coming back that we were kicking her from the Discord server. We were also trying to keep our server/site to active and current members so that was that. I booted her, unfriended her, and I hope to never deal with her again. It\u2019s been almost two years without her so I suppose it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s gone for good.\n\nI\u2019m not even going to mention the amount of lore we had to replace because she didn\u2019t want us using her stuff. Which was fine because in a year, nobody had made a character using her lore. What we replaced it with with something that is currently 100x more successful than what she wrote, which she ended up telling me she didn\u2019t like it. That opinion is null and void at this point tho because things just work. \n\nSo I guess things to take from my story time... don\u2019t use mental illness as excuse for being a brat or asshole if things don\u2019t go your way, don\u2019t lie about things that can really easily be proven wrong, and don\u2019t take advantage of an already bad situation with your own motives. Also don\u2019t tell everybody beside the person you\u2019re plotting with the things you want because that\u2019s not how that works. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far. It was a wild ride so I hope you enjoyed the chaos. Lol.",

            "selftext": "This was a hell of a journey to be sure. This takes place in a day-in-the-life, generally free-form light-fantasy RP community setting, with about 20 - 30 RPers who each have anywhere from 2 - 6 characters of their own at any given time. \n\nThis one RPer enters the community and brings her 6 characters in with her. The characters are pretty interesting, and even my characters end up having some neat interactions with them. \n\nEventually, one of her characters, the one she seems to particularly favor the most, ends up in a relationship with another character. It's a little wild and crazy, but the characters end up being a feisty couple and it works for them... at first. \n\nOver time, the RPer's main character (MC), so to speak, starts to get possessive and forceful on her Love Interest. The MC keeps hounding the Love Interest and does NOT take \"no\" for an answer, to the point that she ends up at his apartment door late at night banging on it and demanding that he let her in. The Love Interest ends up becoming afraid of her, and he breaks up with her.\n\nAfter this happens, the RPer has her character constantly beg the Love Interest to talk to her so that she can apologize, but he's had enough and wants nothing more to do with her. But her MC keeps begging. Her MC starts talking to the Love Interest's friends, begging them to convince the Love Interest to talk to her. They won't do it because it's clear that the \"apology\" she wants to give is just an excuse for the MC to wedge herself back into the Love Interest's life again. \n\nAfter asking the Love Interest's friends and seeing that won't work, the RPer herself sends an OOC note to the other RPer, asking for a retcon. The other RPer rejects the request for a retcon because these antics have gone on for weeks and a bunch of other RPers' characters have been involved. Having to reset everything would disrupt a lot of character activity that went on for a lot of RPers over the course of recent weeks. All the rest of the community agrees that the retcon can't happen and that this RPer's MC is just going to have to try to fix the issue herself in game. Everyone suggests that the MC leave the Love Interest alone. \n\nBut much like her character, this RPer will not take \"no\" for an answer. Since her MC asking other characters for favors won't work, the RPer has one of her other characters approach the Love Interest and offer to sleep with him if he'll agree to talk to the MC. The Love Interest rejects the offer, of course, and other characters are shocked because this particular character was portrayed as very conservative and offering herself up like that seemed way out of character. \n\nSince that didn't work, the RPer had the rest of her characters systematically beg both the Love Interest and all other characters around to get MC and Love Interest together so the MC could \"apologize\" and not one single other character would do it. The RPer's characters all began to become nuisances, parroting the same request over and over again in different forms and fashion. Finally, the other RPers in the community were getting sick of it, and everyone told her that it was best that she just gave that specific plot point up and had her MC move on. She absolutely refused, claiming that her MC was just going to die because the love of her life had rejected her. We tried. We offered story suggestions about how her MC could learn and grow from the experience and actually have some character development, but she just would not bite for anything. \n\nAfter so much of this, the RPer publicly apologized for her behavior, and everyone was like \"sure, it's cool, nbd\" and things went back to normal for... one day. Before her characters all immediately swung back into the same behavior again. After more of this nonsense, the RPer apologized *again*, and again begged for a retcon. By that point, it was clear that this RPer only intended to apologize and retcon so that she could continue with the same antics and not change her behavior at all in the slightest. \n\nEventually she managed to piss off just about everyone in the community, and she went radio silent. Though I'm pretty sure she continued lurking the community. \n\nIt was just, wow... I had *never* seen that kind of desperation while also such a heinously stubborn need to *not* have her character answer for her behavior... She had five whole other characters in relationships of their own, but she just *needed* her MC to be with *that* Love Interest no matter the cost... just, wow.",

            "selftext": "There's this fandom that I like that is hard to find rpers for so I search wherever I can. Reddit, Tumblr, and every rp site I come across. \n\nRecently a partner of mine had to switch to a different app since they were only rping on there now, and I was alright with that but I had never actually had the app before. I had heard about it though and so I made an account and we continued there.\n\nSo I search my fandom and wow! Theres lots of peiple ea3nting to rp! Albiet, a lot of the posts are just \"I'm bored and wanna rp. Dm me if interested\" but whatever, I'll just post my own stuff.\n\nSo I did that. And then get a couple of people that want to play it. One with a Gacha Life avatar).\n\nOne person I havent gotten to see their reply, and the one with the Gacha Life avatar was very surprised at the length of my starter, choosing to express this by \u2022_\u2022\n\n\"Oh no..\" I quietly said out loud to myself, but was then surprised to see that they wrote something close to the length of my starter. I get excited and read it. It is long, but doesnt say a lot and is sorta hard to read. It doesn't respond to where my starter left off and instead it felt almost completely ignored in favor of talking about their own character.\n\nAnd then, get this, they say to me that their next responses will not be that long and will only be about 5 sentences.\n\nI admit, it was my fault for not specifying my writing requirements but I just thought through experience that I wouldnt have to. I have now changed this.\n\nI look through all of the posts again and I don't want to make fun of anyone's art work, but it was clear that young people dominated at least the art section of that group. There was even one prompt that someone put up that listed all of the characters ages. Oldest being 17 but most being 12-14. And I had to have a moment that was like...oh. This is a Chucky Cheese. And then put 18+ on my prompts, not because they're sexual but because..I am not a baby sitter.",

I guess what I'm trying to say is; thanks for existing! \n\nOn that note, this is a throw-away account as I simply don't want this experience to be tied to my main account. I consider it to be embarrassing and it contains smut. It's less so that I fear the people involved will recognize my identity, I'm not exactly hiding it from them as I've voiced my grievances pretty openly and if they somehow happen upon this post, recognize me, and decide to confront me about it, they're quite welcome to do so! As they know, it's nothing personal, I'm simply still extremely upset at the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to the story; this involves three major players besides me. Let's call them Alice, Becky and Casey.  \n\n\nAlice and Casey are acquaintances of mine, as I've played tabletop games online with them. I know Casey far less but she seemed like good people, whereas Alice I know more personally as I had played with them far longer. At the time of the incident I believe we had gotten closer as friends and we often had conversations through Discord pertaining other topics besides tabletop. It was interesting that we gossiped a lot. Just for the sake of complete disclosure, I DO NOT have feelings for Alice in any way shape or form, I'm in a very happy relationship IRL and I make a very clear divide from online things. It simply amused talking to Alice as she had a very unique way of expressing herself.  \n\n\nOn to the subject at hand. This started several months ago when COVID-19 had hit the USA in full force and everyone was going into full shut down mode. My job had completely shut down along with many of my other outlets. Honestly, my whole life was preparing to take a steep nose dive and I could write an entirely different post about it, but I wish to focus entirely on the RP side of the matter. It's funny how it almost perfectly mirrored my life in terms of how badly things were about to get. \n\nSo, with my job shutting down, I found something else that involved long hours of sitting down doing nothing but answering phones. This lead me to having a lot more free time than I usually had. I've been RPing for at least 20 years, but in the past five years or so I had slowed down considerably and this presented itself as an opportunity to tackle on more involved projects.   \n\n\nEnter a Very Adult Group. This was labeled as being a Conanesque post by post forum where you could have characters come in and indulge in lots and lots of gratuitous sex and violence. Gruesome fights and smut with slave girls galore. In the past I had partaken in such things but had moved away from them due to time constraints, however, seeing I had nothing better to do than to talk to idiots over the phone I decided to make a character for it and joined.   \n\n\nI entered as a Slaver character and saw that the place was pretty dead. There were a couple people posting in other areas, but they were simply wandering around and not exactly interacting with one another. The Admin of the group was NPCing folks for people and he was okay about it. I did notice that he ghosted a couple of players but I honestly couldn't blame him for it as they were pretty bad RPers and I probably would have done the same, I felt somewhat bad for him despite being judgmental of his abilities. \n\nSeeing that not much was happening I decided to invite Alice to the group on a whim. I knew Alice wrote smut pretty frequently and in the past she had been very open about her tastes with the other people we played with. No one really judged her though as we were all adults there and I suspect that everyone in the table top group smut, we simply weren't as forward about is as Alice. It was around this time that Casey joined the group too. To this day, I'm not sure if Alice invited her after I did, but more than likely Casey simply found the group by her own means and joined on her own. Ultimately it didn't matter, I didn't speak to Casey very frequently and we didn't even acknowledge each other when we ran into each other in the group. \n\nIt seemed the gates had opened because as soon as Alice and Casey joined, so did Becky and another player. Becky was actually already part of the group, but at the time of that happening I didn't know she was apping an alt. The other player.. let's call them Daniela for the sake of completeness. She plays a minor but pivotal part in the story, and looking back she's truly the catalyst of everything going bad for me. \n\nAlice joined in as a Slaver, whereas Casey, Becky and Daniela all made Slave characters. The way that the GM decided to handle this was to hold a big slave sale at the Slave Market forum and go through the slaves one by one. Unfortunately, he wasn't exactly disclosing how he was handling things and I personally didn't know he was going to go through all of them one after another instead of mentioning them all in the same post. This is important because at the time the slave auction occurred all everyone could see was Daniela's character being auctioned off. Me, Alice and Becky alt, were all Slavers and showed up at the auction. Daniela's character was a buff warrior woman with little intelligence, her profile was pretty bare bones but the player wrote good. Alice and Becky's Slaver character mentioned not being interested in Daniela so I figured I'd give it a shot and buy her. After I did so, the GM started auctioning Casey who was bought by Becky's alt, and after that he auctioned Becky's slave character who was bought by Alice. This was a little disappointing because internally I would have preferred to buy either Casey or Becky who had far more appealing characters and in fact I at least knew Casey enough that I knew I wouldn't have problems writing a slave/master relationship with them. But, for the time being, every player had been paired off with a slave, so it looked like it was a pretty good deal for everyone.   \n\n\nNow, I'm very big into combat scenes, I consider them to be my bread and butter. The main reason why I decided to go at all for Daniela's warrior gal despite her character being just bleh at best was because I figured I could get some good fighting scenes out of her. This turned out to be both the wrong and right answer. As soon as my Slaver character challenged Daniela's slave character to a fight it became pretty clear that Daniela was a HUGE powerposer that simply shrugged off all my attacks in her poses. There had been hints of this in her previous poses as she often described her character being so buff that she could rip her chains off at any time she wanted but I was not aware she was going to take it to complete invulnerability levels. Disappointing, I simply posed my Slaver freeing Daniela telling her that she had no need for a slave that strong. Daniela posed off the scene and I don't know if she left the group after that but she never again posed on the group.  \n\n\nI was pretty miffed, and more so when I glanced over at the other threads to see that Alice was having a good time with Becky's Slave and the same went with Casey and Becky's Slaver. They all seemed to have hit it pretty well off and I was admittedly pretty jealous. At the time I debated simply leaving the group as well as there was literally nothing else for me to do, us three + the GM were pretty much the only players, but I had nothing else better to do and Alice -was- my friend and she was pretty kinky so I thought maybe she could do me a solid. I contacted Alice through Discord and proposed the idea that our Slavers could share Becky's Slave character. She appeared reluctant at first, which I found disappointing, but after some bartering she seemed to open up to the idea of our Slavers getting married so they could share everything. She insisted that she wanted an IC reason for it, claiming that doing otherwise was 'meta gaming', I didn't see why not and I thought the idea was pretty cute so I agreed.   \n\n\nWhile all this was going on I made a few other characters for the forum since I wanted to populate it a little more and give it more NPCs. Some of said NPCs started hanging out with Casey and Becky's Slaver but more into that.\n\nThe next arch of the story involves Alice, Becky's Slave and I going to a raiding party to attack a village to gather some slaves, all the enemies and NPC soldiers being run by the GM. Here's when things started to get really bothersome for me. It was clear that Becky's Slave had gotten EXTREMELY attached to Alice, I couldn't blame her for it really, Alice is a fantastic writer and it's the whole reason why I invited her. But this was beyond ridiculous, Becky would continuously ignore everything my Slaver said or told her even though my Slaver outranked Alice's by quite a lot, and I do mean my Slaver was the head honcho there and Alice was just some random minion. \n\nMore than just that Becky continuously praising and worshiping Alice in her poses and dialogue while off handedly throwing shade at my Slaver. She was doing so in prose so it wasn't something that my character could react to. Things like 'This is the best Owner I could ever have and no one else could compare, certainly not the Slaver Captain who seemed cruel and stupid'. Right there in front of my face! Alice was being her usual amoral self and didn't bother correcting Becky or anything of the sort, which I also found pretty annoying since I thought Alice and I were buddies in the whole thing and here was this random player just shitting all over my character and Alice wasn't doing anything about it. Alice suggested to me through Discord that I should be meaning and act the part of Slaver Captain, but I really wasn't sure what she meant by that. Did she want me to openly attack her Slaver and kill her and Becky? For all my appetite for violence I am a pretty chill player and I would never incite that kind of drama, but despite what Alice had told me OOCly she didn't seem to care about forming a relationship with my Slaver character. For the most part I was just standing there being ridiculed without any means to retaliate. Everyone seemed pretty convinced that my character was the butt monkey of the whole story for some reason.  \n\n\nAfter that, Alice and Becky's Slave very openly decided to have a smut scene and at that point I decided I wasn't going to let them drag down the raid for no reason. I very abruptly interrupted their scene and had my Slaver jump in with both of them, if Alice wanted me to be intrusive I would. She seemed fine with the idea and Becky, ever the faithful and obedient, posed that if her Mistress was fine with it she would accept. Cute. Either way, I was getting a hot threesome so I didn't mind.\n\nCue, the WORST THREESOME THAT I'VE WRITTEN IN MY WHOLE DAMN LIFE\n\nI did not know at the time that writing smut could be so absurdly unpleasant. Not because it was nasty or anything of the sort but I just kept.getting.ridiculed. through the whole thing! Becky continued posing that my Slaver could NOT POSSIBLY compare to Alice, she couldn't hold a candle to Alice in anything she did. At one point I thought to myself that I must have been written some serious gibberish in my poses to be the recipient of this amount of scorn, but I looked back on them and it was all pretty standard stuff, in fact I thought I had improved thanks to hanging out with Alice so much. She is very good at writing smut and I would like to think I picked up a few things. \n\nI decided to crank it up then, more description, more sexiness, more lewd vocabulary! Nope, Nope, Nope. Apparently I suck at this man, not only Becky was wholly unimpressed, Alice ended up kicking me out ICly when I thought they were done, but it turned out she just wanted a round two that was more private. \n\nI was.. devastated.. the whole scene had been One Big Fuck You to me. \n\nCall me a loser if you will for taking RP too seriously, but I kid you not, I didn't sleep at all that night. I was trembling with rage and extremely saddened. I remember waking up in the middle of the night making another post in my phone on the forum how my Slaver just kinna internally wondered if she had been the fifth wheel in all that. Just kind of, showing that I ICly was pretty upset, I spent a full hour on that, it was like my magnus opus as I poured my feelings of worthlessness into that post. I thought that come morning Alice and Becky would read it and come around to realize what they were doing.\n\nNah, next poses were them being lovey dovey to each other and once again ignoring my Slaver as hard as they possibly could. The GM asked at that point if we wanted to do anything in the march towards the fight scene and I very openly said I was ready to get the whole battle started. I really needed to vent and  I was ready to write gratuitous violence and some deeply gory shit. In my mind I thought maybe I would impress Alice and Becky with my writing, but I soon found out it was not to be.\n\nWhile this was going on, my other characters were not having much luck hanging out with Becky's Slaver and Casey. It was pretty much the same thing except now it was Becky doing the scorn. She was just entirely fixated on Becky's Slaver and was interested in fuck all that was happening around her. At one point my character was simply told to stay in one room while they literally went to the other room to fuck. Er.. I mean, my character wasn't like super involved with any of them as my Slaver was with Alice, but rude much? It's not like I wanted a threesome with them (although I would not have said no) but how about a heads up? Anyway, Casey was just being a massive uppity troll and once again I couldn't do shit about it because if I did I feared upsetting Becky, who I felt already did not like me at an OOCly level.\n\nSpeaking of OOCly it was at that point that I decided to prod Becky through DMS. I asked her if I had done something wrong to her and if she was aware she was scorning me in her poses. Becky apologized and said that it wasn't anything personal, her characters just had a tendency to latch on to a person and ignore everyone else. That was a pretty lame excuse IMO, there was ignoring and then there was straight ridiculing, but I told her that Alice had planned for all our characters to grow closer and she seemed alright with that which gave me confidence. I kept telling myself that all I had to do was for Alice and my Slaver to form a bond and then we could all have nice big scenes together without me being left out or anything.\n\nAs the fighting scene was happening however, Alice started posting elsewhere in the forum that her character had returned home with Becky. She had skipped ahead of the fight and was posing as if we had already won, which I found odd, but hey, Alice did buy Becky so I couldn't deny them some more private time. I would get mine eventually I told myself. So I kept trucking along and posing, the battle scene was satisfying but as soon as that was done I was once again forced to endure Alice and Becky's stupid exclusive BS of giving my Slaver the cold shoulder. \n\nLike.. WHAT!? Had I not talked to them about this OOCly?? I was right back to square one, downright to Becky posing shit lie 'Easily ignore every the Slaver Captain said because she's not my Mistress'. I was fuming, and angry at Alice and Becky. They kept telling me things OOCly and acted completely differently ICly. Alice had dragged the fighting scene by her doing inane shit like branding the prisoners and playing grab ass with Becky's Slave and showed no signs whatsoever to even talk to my Slaver, who had captured a ton of slaves and the enemy leader for Alice and presented them to her as a sign of her affection. It was just more Alice and Becky go to their tent to fuck while my Slaver is standing there by herself. \n\nAt one point even the Admin/GM got into the shenanigans and in one scene with Becky's Slaver and Casey he posed that whatever my character was doing was just background noise. Becky and Casey quickly followed through with even Casey claiming, in her pose, that my character was nothing by a fly to her.\n\nI saw Red. \n\nShortly after, Alice started another time skipping thread where she was parading Becky's Slave character on a leash through the city and I just gave up entirely. I have no fucking idea what was Alice's apparent timeline for her Slaver and mine to get together. Maybe it was in real time and it would take years and years. By the way, this whole thing happened in the span of THREE(3) FUCKING MONTHS! Three months of being told in very elaborate and eloquent ways that I suck and my character ain't worth shit no matter how high ranking their position may be. If my Slaver doesn't have Slaves then they suck and their opinion isn't worth anything. More than that, they are to be openly ridiculed for their inability to guess right at some random fuck slave auction. \n\nI flipped my shit, told Alice in Discord I was done, wrote a big farewell post in the forum and left the group.\n\nI cried. Yeah, I said it. After that I went for an 7 mile run or something, came back home, flopped on the ground and cried my heart out in a pool of my own sweat and tears. \n\nThen I lost my job and my house and I've been homeless for another ever since for things that are entirely unrelated to that RP, but WOW! What a journey. And I think it says a lot that after losing my job and house and being forced to work as a day laborer to make end's meet, the thing I'm the most upset about is that RP.\n\nI honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to overcome it. I still have Alice in Discord, I'm not sure if she blocked me or not, I haven't tried messaging her, she hasn't either. It's painful because despite everything I'm genuinely not upset at Alice, Becky or Casey (I am upset at Daniela though, fuck that powerposing bitch), I really REALLY wanted to play with them and that forum was just amazing, it was everything I ever wanted. But the circumstances were just atrocious.\n\nAlice tried her best to help but she ended up making things way worst.  She basically had me by the balls and I don't know if she was aware that she was blue balling me constantly but she just held that carrot over me and never gave it to me because she didn't feel like it. After I kicked Daniela to the curb I though Alice was going to be my safety net. She ended up being a spike pit.\n\nBecky, well, despite everything I still think the player is nice, but she just stuck IC like a motherfucker. \n\nAnd Casey, she was just a massive troll. I'm sure she thought she was being funny and clever, she wasn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read all that, kudos, and I appreciate it. Me, well, dunno what'll happen. I've recovered a fair bit, at least I don't lose as much sleep over it as much as I did before. But the whole experience was a tremendous blow to my ego. Even after this 3-4 months, and with honestly way more pressing matters at hand, I continue thinking about it. I just want to overcome it somehow, RP just to be a method to escape reality, but now that creeping sensation that I suck at everything I do keeps rearing its head out.\n\nMake it stop.",

            "selftext": "In an rp group I\u2019m in, I\u2019m part of a group of friends. I\u2019m good friends with all three, and we are all moderators. However, there is some tension between two mods, we\u2019ll call them A and B. Some time ago A and B had a fight and hadn\u2019t talked in a while until about 2-3 months ago when we banded together again. I was loosely friends with B during this time, but I have been friends with A a lot longer. \n\nThe head mod, we\u2019ll call C, eventually bought A back into the fold to join me, B and C as moderators and rpers. A pairing between A and B had fallen apart due to this fight. It took some time but A and B eventually started being friendly again and talking nicely. However recently that seems to have changed. \n\nA little while ago B left the team briefly because there is an individual they are uncomfortable with in the group. This person had rp\u2019d smut with B when they weren\u2019t 18, and B only recently found this out. Nothing can be done now as neither me, A or C knew them previously and have only known them from now on as being 18. B is understandably uncomfortable with this person. However this seems to have caused some tensions again between A and B.\n\nB has... a pretty bad track record at being passive aggressive. I\u2019ve tried talking to them about it before and they\u2019ve apologised, intended to fix it but nothing has come of it. And now again they\u2019re being passive aggressive with A. They have created an entirely new channel to talk about their characters where A is not. They have also been known to leave messages like \u201cThis is ____\u201d when A is not talking about the right thing in the right channel, and when A (also kind of passive aggressively) says \u201cok I won\u2019t talk about it then\u201d, B says things like \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you had to stop talking about it but w/e! \ud83d\ude0a\u201d\n\nAnd thus, it\u2019s making me, a mutual friend pretty uncomfortable. So. What I\u2019m asking for advice on is how do I go about talking to these two, to get them to be a little less passive aggressive and antagonistic around each other, especially B? I don\u2019t want to ruin the rp dynamic and have our group lose members because of it.",

I mean the rp was spot on and one of the best but then it went down hill fast. I only knew him for a few days but as each day passed he started to become more rude. As I was busy doing normal life things, he would say or ask why was I online. I told him on discord that I don\u2019t change my online status and sometimes I have one of my partners answer me.  \n\nHe would say okay and move on. But then he told me he was upset and already I told him I want going to be on much since I didn\u2019t feel great. \n\nNext moment I know, he blows up on me, I turned around and told him I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not feeling  good and told him to F*** off. \nHe came back with \u201c you better that Fithy mouth of yours. And you are so lucky I wasn\u2019t there to make you shut up \u201c \n\nOkay I was in shock since I haven\u2019t had a guy talk to me that way before. So I told him he needed to leave. He refused and told me I couldn\u2019t make him. Haha guess what? I made the separate server. \n\nI told him he needs to learn some manners, needs to learn how to respect women, not be so rude, and have his ego popped. \n\nThen I removed him from the server I made and I also blocked him. It felt so damn good to do that and now I feel so much happier. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is long but I just had to vent this out!",

            "selftext": "Soooo, this happened a long time ago, when I used to do group rps on a Russian forum. This was the very first rp I joined, and hoooboy did it go well. \n\nI found this rp, full of fantasy and magic, so naturally, I asked to join in. The person who invited me messaged the Mod, who then informed me of all the rules. The rules were reasonable, and I asked a plethora of other questions, to clear up any misunderstandings. After that, I was allowed into the chat (hotdamn, security).\n\nThe first ref flag occurred when I was preparing to write my first line, getting to know people OOC. Most of the people only chatted OOC and only the mod seemed to have a story going on. The rp was somewhat dead and the only active plot line was exclusively between the mod and their friend. \nI wrote my introduction post, making my guy a hermit magician living in the woods, and with a little bit of time, around 3 people actually joined in. The chat was coming back to life and we had a rather active plot going on. An important note: my posts were very long, the only exception being when there was literally nothing to say. \nThe mod and their friend would occasionally write as well, and they would always add in the hostile \u201cby the way, guys, this has nothing to do with your story.\u201d It was rather concerning, but we ignored it cuz we were having so much fun. \nAfter a long while, I decided to invite some of my real life friends into the rp, trying to get them into it. I asked my partners from the chat and they all said they\u2019d be happy to see new faces. So I added them in.\n\nApparently that was a wrong move.\n\nI got a scolded by the mod, who said I should have asked them first, which was reasonable. I apologized and everything kept going as normal. Though, at that point I was getting annoyed with the mod and their \u201cholier-than-thou\u201d attitude. \n\nEverything went down when another player join in as our story villain and decided to set my guy\u2019s forest on fire (in which our entire gang was hanging out on, for now). The villain was awesome, and so our team was making an escape, at which point me, a first-timer, wrote this.\n \u201cCharacter jumped out of the window of the burning house and into the forest.\u201d\n\nAnd then it went down. \n\nThe mod flipped out, accusing me of only writing one-liners (so wrong), sharing too much OOC (still wrong), breaking rules (the adding thing wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the rules) and generally being a trouble maker. A retorted with the fact that before I joined, the only people who wrote were the mod and his friend, and that I had a team of around 7 people actively rp-omg for most of the day. I basically brought the chat to life. I also quoted one of my longest posts in the chat, which didn\u2019t even fit fully on the screen. The mod and I were going back and forth, until another player reached out to me, suggesting we make a new group, without the big angry mod guy. \n\nAnd thus, the piper with a flute that told stories left the dreadful tyrant, leading all of the citizens away from his rule and into a land of tales and wonders. \n\nStory over.",
