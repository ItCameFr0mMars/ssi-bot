I was going to use the word jerk rather but let's not make a garden out of one strand of grass.\n\nYou ever end up befriending people in a RP setting, just chill out OOC and talk about your stuff only to find out how much one-sided your conversations are?\n\nExample:\n\nImagine your friend talking to you about his thread or RP with his character. His character this that, blablabla. And it's all nice, right? Maybe despite the fact you don't really care you actually go on to listen him out and respond to him and make a conversation; an interactive one. Maybe you branch out, start talking about games, IRL. Fun, right?\n\nNice.\n\nNow you go to him about something that just amused you out of what just happened on a game, or what you saw in a video, on the RP discord server\u2014 whatever\u2014 you tell 'em and he just 'LOL' and stays mute.\n\nFuck you. For real.\n\nThen maybe he comes to you three hours later about something else posting some dumb shit or how he just dissed some guy on Facebook almost as if he'd demand you to start a conversation or back him up. Maybe you do.\n\nThen you try yourself and he just LOL.\n\nNah dude. 'Aight, imma head out.' No sense in even talking to these people and I outright despise them. It's a bit like ghosting because really a 'LOL' \u2014 and I mean a single LOL without any other response or whatever isn't really a response. It's as useful as 'oof' in a debate.\n\nAnd nothing I just realized I need better friends on Discord cause it's hella boring sharing RP stuff or anything with these dudes.\n\nPeace, later.",

            "selftext": "Like a lot of people, I\u2019ve had my ups and downs with roleplays in my four years of doing it. Sometimes the roleplays I\u2019m in are quite enjoyable, including a great plot, an active partner, all that good stuff. Other times, I\u2019ll meet with an illiterate (I don\u2019t judge, those roleplayers are fine to me), a person who fails to maintain a fun character, or someone who doesn\u2019t really contribute to the roleplay. Just to clarify, I roleplay on AminoApps.\n\nI\u2019m going to be talking about some of my experiences in roleplays. I\u2019ll be venting a little just to get this off my chest, and keep in mind that these experiences were fairly recent PLUS they\u2019re centered around one person I roleplay with in a 1x1. I\u2019ll call him TV.\n\nLet\u2019s start with his characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for interacting with a somewhat silent, toughened character who seems like a really good guy. But when you make your character out to be some kind-hearted dude whose combat skills were not mentioned in any way who can somehow take out an enemy with ease is really funny to me. I\u2019m normally the one coming up with villains who I legitimately describe as horrifying or relentless or worse. I make some of my villains sick in the head, others intelligent and decently skilled in combat, oh, and others that I hide away so that the little \u201cboss battle\u201d doesn\u2019t get cleared in a flash with TV\u2019s character not receiving a single scratch. My point is: I see TV\u2019s characters as some flawless saints that take out my villains with no emotion for some reason. When I say, [villain] is a witty killer and probably shouldn\u2019t be messed with alone, TV sends in his seemingly timid character (who is usually a male teenager) to fight this killer too soon. Really gets under my skin but I go along with it. I sometimes even use side characters to hint at TV\u2019s characters that, \u201cHey, you probably shouldn\u2019t fight that crazy bastard right now. Doesn\u2019t seem smArT.\u201d \n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWell, how do the fights between TV\u2019s character and your villains usually play out?\u201d Simple. Since I think of TV\u2019s character as a Mary Sue (Gary Stu, whatever) and TV as technically a godmodder, the fights are extremely short with TV always coming out victorious. And me? Well I just say fuck it and let my villains fall. I guess I do it because of TV\u2019s autohitting (where his characters immediately land hits without giving me a chance to decide what happens) AND dodging if I DO get the chance to throw a punch. Note that I\u2019m the one who always attempts to hit a character, while TV lands multiple \u201csUper poWErfuL\u201d hits like haymakers and dodges 97% of my hit attempts when I don\u2019t let my villain fail immediately. \n\nSo that\u2019s all for now I guess. I\u2019ll probably make a second part for this rant/vent another time just to give you a view into my roleplays.",

Basically all the characters from LotR are too old now and their kids are going on a new adventure.\"\n\nThe fans of LotR will understand why I was so confused. For those who don't know the lore (and I'll readily admit, I'm not well versed myself) there are about--and I'm just assuming here--3,000 or 4,000 years between when The One Ring was made and the end of the third LotR movie. I think. \n\nThe point is it's well over 16 years. And this person kept insisting their character is biologically 16 years old, but somehow was secretly there to forge not just The One Ring, but also all of the others. I asked if it was some sort of time travelling but it wasnt. I was then told it was more of a descriptor of her power, not so much a plot point. Oh okay. Thats fine. I suppose I could work around that. \n\nI'm then informed of all this insane skills and abilities this character has, of all these latent, dormant powers that she subconsciously draws upon in day to day life without realizing, etc etc. Before I can object to the lack of flaws--the words \"absolutely perfect\" were used more than once--I'm given a writing sample that details how this character moves, talks, behaves, etc etc. \n\n...she's a ditz. She giggles at everything, she's very cheerleaderish, she somehow gets away with wearing extremely revealing clothing (in the harsh Northern lands of Ice, from where this character originates), basic jokes and the most obvious innuendos sail over her head and everything has to be explained to her.  But she's also an extremely capable magician and has every single spell ever in existence memorized.  And she's read countless tomes from dozens of authors and has studied with the elves and has statues of her erected outsude the schools because she set academic records.  \n\n*sigh*\n\nEdit: not that revealing clothing has anything to do with being a ditz. Its just that i think this person had an ideal character designed and,  just as they over did the rest of it,  i think they overdid the 'sexy' factor with the clothes is all.",

            "selftext": "In the general RP hobby, I have two huge pet peeves: 1) When the other RPer writes my character's actions for me, and 2) when the other RPer tries to rewrite my character's backstory. \n\nI will say, though, that I do suspect there are some folks out there who work just fine with this kind of RP. Some people are able to collaborate so well that they can interchange each other's characters, and to me, that's actually mighty impressive. \n\nBut for myself, ehhh.... I think that can only really work if you are trying to create a new character with your RP partner's help, or if that RP partner knows your characters so extremely well that they can portray those characters to a degree that you would 100% absolutely agree with. \n\nIn my case, my characters are usually at the very least 60% thought out before I drop them into an RP. They have at least a basic backstory and a baseline personality. But I have other characters that are far more deeply established, with backstories and personalities that I've tweaked and added to for years. When another RPer tries to control my character's actions or even tries to rewrite their *backstory*, it feels invasive to me. Most of all, it irritates me because more often then not, the RPers who have done this to me have been ones that *did not* fully understand my characters and *could not* portray them accurately without my guidance. \n\nA first, very simple example is this one RP I had going with a person. My character and their character were walking together, one after the other. Then the RPer wrote: \"[RPer's Character] stops, suddenly, and [Fyrsiel's Character] bumps into him, then blushes.\" \n\nI... get that this was meant to be a cutesy segue into a romantic scene... but the problem here was that my character was a bit neurotic and very quick to lose his temperature, though he did not show this aspect of himself in public. So if I had the chance to write my character's response to that action, it would have instead gone this way: \"When [Fyrsiel's Character] bumped into [RPer's Character], he stopped, grit his teeth, and berated [RPer's Character] for not watching where he was going.\" \n\nWhich... I'm assuming is not the response that RPer was expecting... But they did not know this because they did not yet know my character well enough to write his actions for me... \n\nThe second example I have concerns the rewriting  backstory issue. Another character I had was a partially demonic guy. I started an RP with a friend of a friend, and one of the first things she did was create another partially demonic character that was supposedly my character's cousin..... \n\nMm'kay. Well, actually, in that case, I thought, eh, you know why not. This might actually be kind of cool expanding the family a bit. I'll roll with it. \n\nMy demonic character was 25 years old. Her character was 16 years old, so they are 9 years apart in age. At one point, she wrote her character having a flashback. The flashback showed her character, as a 5 year old child, sitting under a tree in a wide grass field with my demon character's mother. The character's memory showed the mother reaching up, picking an apple out of a tree, and handing it down to her character. \n\nNice, sweet memory, but there's a problem here... My character's mother died when he was 10 years old. So her character, during this memory, could only have been a one-year-old *infant* for this memory to have been possible........... Not only that, but by the time my character was 5 years old, himself, he and his mother had moved to a city where there were... very few fields and trees... \n\nThe reason for this huge continuity error was that the RPer had, first of all, no idea that my demonic character's mother was dead, and second, that he and his mother had moved to the city before this character had even been *born*... She also did not know my character's real age, yet... It's just... missing all that information, I don't understand why she thought she could just inject this piece of history into my character's backstory... it bugged me a bunch. \n\n\nIt just doesn't work if you aren't familiar enough with the other RPer's characters and their backstories, because there could be things about those characters' personalities or histories that haven't been revealed in the plot yet. \n\nUltimately, I just think the best way to avoid problems like this is to *ask* before attempting to write or rewrite your RP partner's characters... Always ask if it's okay, first...!",

            "selftext": "Rp venting here because well, I have no where else to vent at and that\u2019s particularly my fault being in that predicament. My experiences roleplaying has left me more alone than I was in the past. Before, I use to rp with other people, have fun with them, make friendships etc. But after going through many discontinued rps, a failed rp server, losing rp groups/partners/friends, butting heads with owners about the mismanagement of the rp servers, and burning bridges in anger and sadness has changed me. I can no longer have bright optimism like I did before. I want to but it\u2019s been happening for so long that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible anymore. So because of that- I grew distant and I raised my standards for rps and even higher for those who run them.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m thinking \u201cthis is the part I should\u2019ve logged out of this account and make a throwaway account for this section\u201d but fuck it- what\u2019s there to lose other than my motivation? It\u2019s going to be out in the open. I don\u2019t have many people I can call a friend or that I want to call them a friend. Because of me burning so many bridges in the past for rping and the hurt and betrayal that I felt from the people I thought were close to me, I desensitized myself to just call them \u201cassociates\u201d or \u201caquatints\u201d. I try not to get to close with the rp partners/groups I\u2019m in to save the trouble of me getting too invested, expecting too much from them and leaving me in a emotional mess if everything falls apart. And yeah- this extends out of rping.. \n\nI do take rping seriously now because of my experiences in the rp community. My high expectations causes me to criticize things harshly and a lot and that criticism goes towards the owners (and sometimes admins). I don\u2019t pull my punches for anyone if I\u2019m pissed off about mismanagement. I\u2019m usually the one who calls out the owners and admin for this while people will just watch the shitshow.\n\nI do have to confess that, the reason why I explode so easily to admins and owners is that majority of these owners have friends, loyal staff, and no matter what state the server or rp is in they\u2019re having fun. I never had the luxury of friends helping me out in making/running a server. I had to make the lore, plot, character sheets, rules, channel layout ect. While I did had some friends join my server, they weren\u2019t active and were never there for me when I needed them the most..and that thing was when my own rp server got raided. It was my fault only for not understanding how to use discord bots to prevent it but...I just wished someone was there for me, someone to help me, hell, to tell me that things were going to get better. But, they shrugged it off. I was alone and then that\u2019s when I realized I had to look out for myself. So yeah you can call it jealousy, envy, resentment w/e but I just wanted people to do better for their servers with the people and resources they have. Contrary to what I said in this post but I hate doing callouts, I don\u2019t enjoy confrontation I rather avoid it but again, seeing mismanagement and abuse ignores all of that.\n\nAnd where did all that effort get me? Others and I banned off a rp server that later nuked itself and reopened? Owners and admins feeling threatened and spiteful around me? Leaving more friends behind? Fucking goddammit I know all of it is my fault and because of that I\u2019m alone. At the end of the day and why I do what I do is to have ONE successful roleplay. I want it, I crave for it EVERYDAY. I want it more than winning the fucking lottery. I\u2019ve been rping for 7 years, I\u2019m 19 about to be 20, I had these feelings for so long and It feels like I\u2019m the only one who goes through this. You know how painful it is to think about your past rps? How they could\u2019ve been so cool? The scenarios that you and other characters could be in? Just imagine having those thoughts about unfinished rps for 7 years.\n\nI think I said too much here. I fear if I continue, I\u2019ll start crying and deleting the post in regret.",

            "selftext": "This made me so upset I  need to say something. In reality it's probably pretty small but hey it still bothered me.\n\nSo I run this modern fantasy rp server with two other people.  One of those people we're going to call Ember. So me, Ember, and the third member each made a gang of sorts in the server. Their's is more mafia and Yakuza based. Mine is more of an assassin thing. \n\nSo today Ember said that she was going to make a character for my gang. I was like oh, dope. I have no problem with that. Then they made the character and I think it's a bit op. \n\nLike first off the ocs backstory is pretty generic. No parents had abusive adopted parents. Killed and started liking it. That's not too bad. I mean the backstory isn't too important in our rps so eh. What really made me mad was that Ember just had to make hers the bestest one in my gang. Which I don't like.\n\nSo in the gang they have tattoos to show kills. And Ember's oc has SO MANY that the uniform needed to be altered just for her so her tattoos won't show (even though the og uniform already covers the entire body and they wouldn't be seen.). She's just the best outta all of them. I don't like that and think it's op.\n\nLike I wouldn't make a character for Ember's gang and be like \"aww they're the best and so badass and they've killed more than the boss has\" why? Cause it's isn't right! At least not to me. And I don't like op Characters like that. They aren't fun.\n\nAgain, this is a small thing but it bothers me cause ai find it kinda rude. Is that just me? I hope I explained it well enough nso my side could at least be understood.",

I only get a line or so out of them, even after my character (Phantom) committed murder. \n\nNow, I will admit, I'm not always the best at responding with big paragraphs, but I feel like whenever I respond, I at least make sure it's over 5 sentences and gives them something to keep the plot going.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, because I'm truly bored of the rp, but I do want to do a Phantom of the Opera rp, and that was the only person who wanted to do one as well. Not to mention that her OC is incredibly apathetic, even when she's being threatened. I'm not sure how to tell them that I can't be the only one to push the plot forward and keep things interesting. I'm not saying I'm perfect at rp, but if I can tell that my rp partner puts no effort in, I get pissed off pretty quickly.\n\nAny suggestions as to what I should do, or where I could find a better rp partner for Phantom of the Opera?\n\n(sorry about any spelling or grammatical errors.

            "selftext": "This is the third post in my ongoing, nonlinear series chronicling my (mis)adventures as a Mass Effect Roleplayer and my interactions with all the various malcontents dotted around the scene. For this one, we journey back to the server from my first post to explore even more dumb moves and terrible adminning from the mods there. In fact, there's so much of it that instead of telling a traditional story, I'll be using a bullet point format, because most of these things are annoying enough for their own individual posts, and I don't want you to feel like you're reading The Lord of the Rings! However, we'll still be going in roughly chronological order, starting with the process of creating a character and moving through to my eventual banning.\n\n\\- Like most serious roleplay servers, this server required you to submit an app. That's fine. What's a little more annoying but also acceptable is how stringently all characters are required to follow the lore. This is annoying because of how long your character's bio has to be. The bare minimum, if I recall correctly, was around four paragraphs, which doesn't sound like all that much, but was seen as lazy and was looked down on by the mods even though you were following the rules. Coupled with the strict adherence to the franchise's lore, this could result in situations where you'd have to take hours and hours and hours (this was a Discord server btw) talking with the mods and writing until your app was most likely a couple of pages long. Plus, the server was so busy that, if you lagged in your response for any reason, your conversation with the mods could be drowned out due to the fact that there was only one app review channel serving at least 6 prospective roleplayers at any one point. Oh, and if for whatever reason you weren't right there replying to and fixing criticisms? Guess what, that was looked down on too. (You'll notice a lot of this here.)\n\n\\- For some unfathomable reason, 2D faceclaims were fine as long as a) you created them yourself or commissioned them, b) you received permission from the author, or c) you provided credit. However, 3D faceclaims (Source Filmmaker stuff, for instance) were inexplicably not allowed. If you didn't have a 2D faceclaim, then one of the staffers, who was actually quite a good artist, would make one for you, which is pretty sick. The problem? Aside from the description provided in your app, you had no control over the art style, what your character was doing, or anything else about the image; you got what you got. Is your character doing something they wouldn't actually do? Too bad. Is your character wearing clothes they'd actually avoid? Too bad. You got what you got. It didn't help that this artist, who was iirc not only an admin but also a GM, was frequently very coarse and rude. And that's even by her own admission - she referred to herself as a bitch at least once, to my knowledge.\n\n\\- You could only submit apps for your first character within a certain window, right around the time the next training class was to begin. This went one of two ways: either people would rush to get their apps in, or they would choose to spend months beforehand going over the entire app with a fine-toothed comb with a GM to make the irritating verification and approval process listed above as painless as possible. Both approaches had serious caveats that wouldn't exist if you could just submit an app at any time.\n\n\\- Once your character was approved, *they were the property of the staff.* You were not allowed to use your own creation on any other server. I assure you, you are not drunk, high, or having a stroke.\n\n\\- Even if you managed to survive the chore of getting an app in, the roleplay experience was still plagued by poor modding and GMing. For one, no, your eyes didn't deceive you in that last post: they had *training classes for roleplaying, and the training classes were on a separate server.* What this says to me is that they assumed that every new member is an idiot and they needed to be taught how to RP. Granted, in my case, that turned out to be more than right, as we'll see in the next bullet point. But it says a lot about how little faith the mods and GMs had in the community to just assume you were an idiot.\n\n\\- For my first training class (I went through two), I had a serious problem with godmodding. I was so used to having 100% total control over my own writings that I had no idea how to *not* godmod while still creating a compelling story for my character. I knew this was a serious problem, so took it on myself to talk with the mods and GMs and see what could be done. However, the staff steadily became more and more frustrated with me as time went on, which was probably due to both my continued struggles to rein in my own godmodding tendencies and my incessant communication with them on these issues. They didn't really bother hiding their irritation either. It got to the point where they assumed bad faith by default and required me to submit my posts to them for approval before I was allowed to post them on the server.\n\n\\- Aside from this, the server was one of those that requires long-form posts - at least two paragraphs per post, in this case. This would be fine in any other environment. However, this training server was insanely active, even with only a few players per class, and that was largely down to the relentless posting speed the GMs pushed. You were expected to get several long-form posts in per day, and if you're as dedicated as I was to extracting every last drop of narrative and prose quality from your posts, that meant you'd spend several hours a day refining your posts. This, in turn, would take away from the amount of time you could spend interacting with the community...\n\n\\- ...and if you weren't very active in the community, that would be held against you as well. See, at the end of the training class, everyone would be assigned a grade, and you had to get, iirc, a 65 to pass. Part of your grade was based off of how much and how well you interacted with the community. But how am I expected to be able to interact enough with the community when I'm spending several hours a day working on my posts to satisfy your high requirements for post quality, length and frequency?\n\n\\- These two factors (my problems with godmodding and my apparent lack of activity outside of the RP channels, even though I spent an insane amount of time interacting with the community) combined with a couple of other factors I was not informed of to result in me failing my first class. After I failed and those who made it through joined the main server, I was sent a screenshot indicating that there were other players mocking me for my failings as a roleplayer and a person - and that the mods were *allowing it.* Was I a narcissist back then? You bet. Am I still? Probably; I'd say I am in a lot of ways, and that's something that has to change. But have I ever been so intentionally? No. But no one ever informed me that that was how some of my actions were being taken, especially not the mods.\n\n\\- Once you failed a class, you had to wait six months to take another class, though that could be reduced if you were active enough. I busted my ass to get back in, and sure enough, my wait was reduced... to a month and a half. However, the next class I was eligible for had 28! players, due to a major YouTuber covering the server and directing loads of people to it. I knew I still needed loads of help to refine my roleplaying and knock out the last traces of any accidental godmodding tendencies, and I knew the mods wouldn't be able to provide it, so I chose to wait until the next class, when things would be a little calmer and I could receive more one-on-one help from the GMs. Except one thing: I wasn't informed that skipping a class would be considered a failure. This will be relevant shortly.\n\n\\- For the next class I actually chose to participate in, there was a new rule: none of the roleplayers in this *training class* would be allowed to approach the staff for assistance. I'm 99% sure this was targeted specifically at me, due to my history of chatting at great lengths with the staff in order to deal with my godmodding problems. I believe they were aiming to catch me out so they could have a reason to fail me.\n\n\\- Near the start of this training class, there was an issue where I was looking to detail some of my character's military history. Problem was, trainees weren't allowed to extend the lore at all, even in ways that wouldn't impact anyone else in any way, so I had to resort to finding a canon battle for my character to have participated in. The issue is, my character is a turian (I say is because I still use her - DM me if you want to RP with an alien!), and there aren't any known canon battles that my character could have fought in during her career. So I had the idea of having had her in a squad that very secretly collaborated with the Systems Alliance, the human government, in a canon battle. However, I was under a lot of stress at the time, from the server, from the negative impacts it had on my real life, and from college, and so I forgot to be specific with my intentions. So when I discussed my idea with a mod, I got what I mistakenly thought was an okay to include it, then went and included it in a post. This is what eventually led to my failing the class.\n\n\\- After that, and after I accidentally approached an uninvolved mod, the mods decided to discuss the prospect of failing me, and therefore having me banned, without giving me any way to defend myself. Apparently me approaching the wrong admin in a moment of high stress was seen as me trying to divide the moderation team, which was a major contributing factor in the decision to fail me. Because they'd decided that skipping a class counted as a fail, that meant I had now failed three classes and was subsequently permabanned.\n\n\\- After the decision had been made, I was told by one of the mods that I had \"acted as if I had better things to do.\" This despite the fact that I had spent so much time on the server and working on my posts that I had almost no real life due to how much time it and my college life took up. This despite the fact that I'd poured my heart into every single post. This despite the fact that, during the month-and-a-half gap between my two classes, I'd gone far out of my way to help other players get their characters fixed up and approved, and a few of the characters I personally helped with wound up on the main server.\n\nBut there is a happy ending, of a sort! Turns out these were only a few of the numerous terrible stories surrounding the mods and GMs. Over the next couple of years, activity continued to dwindle and dwindle as more and more players became frustrated with them and left. A few of the players splintered off to start their own similar servers, and I'm now even a mod on one of them. As for the server itself? It eventually died entirely, and the last post I know of from it is one of the staffers lashing out at the community in an angry tirade. But I've risen above their BS and gone on to have a long and enjoyable career in the ME RP community anyway... despite them.",

It's becoming incredibly difficult to roleplay with this person due to the sheer fact that I know next to nothing about their characters. I understand that it's lame to write out EVERYTHING a character says or feels in a post, that isn't what I am referring to. I am referring to not even getting so much as a hint of what they are thinking or feeling in their mannerisms, in their facial expressions, in anything. I am basically responding to simple actions. I've attempted to gently encourage them by remarking that I love when they paint a visual with their words about how the character(s) is/are feeling, but nevertheless we fall back into this pattern. I am not sure what to do at this point since plot after plot is coming to an agonizing lull. This problem doesn't stop with this one partner; I've had to step down from multiple roleplays due to this phenomenon of people waiting for the other party to carry the plot.

            "selftext": "Okay. I run many discord rp servers. All of them fantasy and in their own worlds. So we write lore for them. Sometimes it's very specific. For example in one of my servers, the magic is very specific (meaning one race has a specific power and can't get another. Like only fire elemental demons can make fire).\n\nI'm saying all of this because whenever someone enters a server. We always say to read through ALL of the lore before submitting a character. Cause trust me, we'll know if you haven't. It's not rocket science. Just read it all and it'll make the process of submitting your character much easier. We'll even help you if confused!\n\nSo this all came about because recently, someone tried to submit a character and they were completely wrong. They were trying to use a race that wasn't even in our world. So it was clear they didn't read it. I tried telling them this simply saying \"please read through the lore. Your character will not fit here.\" \n\nHow do they respond? By telling me to f off and go to hell and that they didn't care about lore. I kicked that person because why waste my time. I knew they weren't going to read it if that's their reaction. And no way would their character ever be accepted. So I just kicked them.\n\nJust read the lore if there is any. It'll make things easier. On both parties.",
