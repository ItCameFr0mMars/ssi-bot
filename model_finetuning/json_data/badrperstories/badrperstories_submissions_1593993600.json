I'm getting this out now cause it just recently happened.\n\nOkay so one person on one of my servers, we'll call him Jim, had a lot of suggestions for my server because he thought it was boring. Now suggestions are fine, but the way he did it was just so up his own ass I can't take it.\n\nHe gave a bunch of suggestions which would go completely against how me and the other owners want to run the server (for example a zombie drug that gets out. That would hinder literally everyone in the server and not everyone would want that.) Another one was a big gang war that involved the three main gangs. \n\nSo two of the main gang heads are lovers. So one would gang would already be at a huge disadvantage. Plus they have their own little niches, one deals in white collar crimes, one is an assassin group, and one deals with drugs. They have no real reason to fight each other. We tried telling Jim that but he was so adamant on wanting a gang war (even though none of his characters are even in the gangs)\n\nAgain, the problem isn't the suggestions but the way he presented them and himself made Jim seem like a pompous jerk. Like he knew everything. Talking to him felt like a brick wall. If my server is so boring, leave and make your own. You won't be missed",

            "selftext": "So this may end up being quite the unpopular post, but here we go.\n\nI have been in the RP community for over a decade now, primarily utilizing forums. I always loved RP due to how it could help me connect with others. It helped me feel creative, it felt like a wonderful hobby that I could use to unwind at the end of the day. My partner and I could email each other or use forum chats to talk, and I often found the people I met were wonderful and kind, people I remained friends with even to this day. \n\nI used to check my forums a while into the day, when I\u2019d taken care of chores/gotten home from work. One post a day or more is pretty active for forums and it\u2019s a lot for me to write due to the time and effort I put into replies. If I was busy because of work or university, I could give it around three days to a week before I had to have a reply ready, and no one really gave me guff for it. You weren\u2019t expected to put your RPs before your life. You weren\u2019t expected to shackle yourself to another person and spend any of the free time you have locked to the PC just to not upset them. People had boundaries and respected them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but the RP scene feels very different now that I\u2019ve branched into Reddit and Discord, and it has turned me from an active, happy writer to a very weary, slow-posting individual who is prone to ghosting at the drop of a hat. \n\nI know, I know! Ghosting is a bad, nasty word here! A lot of people take it ridiculously personally and don\u2019t think at all of why the other person left, because feelings! But hear me out, I want this to make sense to people so maybe it won\u2019t happen to others as often-\n\nSince I started using Discord to RP four years ago, I noticed that people in the RP scene nowadays are very needy, and maybe it\u2019s just me getting old, but it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nEvery time I\u2019ve tried to start an RP on Discord, I\u2019m chased off, because after weak plotting where I can tell the other person just wants to steamroll into short RP posts, even though I\u2019m specifically listed as a novella writer [profiles don\u2019t seem to be read much, they feel almost like a waste of time now], I end up waking up every day to a message. Or two. Or three. I start playing a game? Message reminding me about the RP as if I can\u2019t have my own life. I don\u2019t reply instantly? Message, usually apologizing a thousand times for the post being bad or something. I go to sleep? Message to wake up to about me abandoning them. \n\nIt feels terrifying to reach out to new partners because sometimes this behaviour has gone so far I need to block. Even that doesn\u2019t work sometimes with them creating a huge stink in some RP Search group I\u2019m in, blasting me and screeching to everyone around until I look like a fool. I always get worried that my next RP partner will want all of my free time every single day, and it\u2019s made it harder and harder to write. The pressure it causes has made me stop writing on my own as well, since the feeling of being constantly watched or having someone constantly hovering there waiting for me and watching my online status so they can message me the instant they see activity has now become associated with even being on the computer for me.\n\nThe clinginess has exhausted me, and I\u2019m sick of people having these ridiculous expectations I can\u2019t meet. They never listen when I explain what\u2019s happening and that I need them to back off, they either get mad or turn into tyrants that wield pity like a weapon, crying and threatening you with their health until you listen to them. Sometimes they\u2019ll agree to back off just to continue to message at the same frequency. I feel worn out explaining anything, I know that people won\u2019t care about my comfort. So I ghost. \n\nI just wanted to post this to hopefully have people that do this kind of thing realize how invasive and stressful it is to have someone constantly invading your boundaries. That hopefully people can look past their own situation and actually think about why someone might ghost next time. RP used to be about both people, about being a fun hobby. Now it just feels like I\u2019m signing off on a work contract for a demanding employer, and it sucks because this has been one of my favourite things for most of my life and one of the only ways I feel I can connect with people, and I don\u2019t feel like I can be comfortable in these spaces anymore because of this self-centred behaviour running rampant. \n\nPlease, think before you get angry at a ghoster. Learn to respect other people\u2019s time and space, don\u2019t be the type to chase someone out of writing entirely.",

            "selftext": "This will be a long one, I even broke it up into paragraphs for you :) Does have a few sexual themes in it so beware!  \n\n\nMasterchief = Other Roleplayer  \n\n\nMe and the masterchief hit off really well a few months ago in a discord server. He actually approached me in DM and was like 'Hey wanna stop doing some things on this server and do things privately?' I thought it wasn't a half bad idea and so we did. We discussed many different things like what sort of roleplaying genres we're into and all that, but eventually we settled on the standard medieval fantasy setting.  \n\n\nImmediately, the one thing I sort of disliked from the get-go was how gamey and structured everything Masterchief had felt. Some stuff of his was blatantly taken from DnD and other popular ficitional sources, but I looked past it because not everyone is particularly the greatest world builder or storyteller in the world. I'm not trying to be an asshole about it but, I appreciate when stuff I roleplay with is a little unique and feels different from mainstream or cliches.  \n\n\nNot too long after sort of breaking the ice and discussing things, we got right off into roleplaying. We both agreed to take turns being in control of the plot at certain periods, and so it was my turn. I set up two characters, a grizzled mercenary guy, and a cherry-gal to help guide the young elf character of his through the story. All seemed to be fine at first. Or not really.  \n\n\nMasterchief was prone to random immersion-breaking moments where a charater would go on paragraph length explanations on a question asked. So if say the Mercenary man asked 'Hey, how does X and Y work in the elven world?', somehow without being some sort of scholar or big-brain nerd, there'd just be these boring and long wall of text like explanations towards something. I stuck through with it and looked past it despite it bothering me. What irritated me a little more was, when i described a few environments like a forest or a town, he'd seemed to just put a one sentence response to it, or his character would seem indifferent at times.  \n\n\nFast fowarding a bit as we delved later into the story, had a few battles here or there, we ended up at a tavern (Epic right?) Masterchief's character and the lady character so far have been having some flirty implications as they interacted, but nothing too crazy. But after something sets her off and causes her to break down crying, a trauma from the past, he naturally comes to comfort her. But the *IMMEDIATE* next response was to begin groping them and telling them 'I'm here for you'. I felt bothered by it, but kept playing along. It was super cringey, and way-way too overdetailed, his dude had like a 7 inch cock and despite never having sex before was like a monkey-poon slaying badass. It really felt like he didn't care to learn about my character and just wanted to satiate some sort of sexual desire.  \n\n\nLots of interactions from there out were just very repetitive and not very fun to do. Somehow the two characters after one session of sex became the best of lovers, constantly groping eachother or kissed inbetween conversations. It wasn't at all exciting and not what I intended the thing to devolve into. I really like having a meaningful plot, and meaningful actions. Saying 'I love you so much' isn't really building character, just my boredom.  \n\n\nEventually I sorted ghosted him for awile after feeling defeated that I couldn't get him on track, nor focused.  \n\n\nBut it goes deeper than that.  \n\n\nNot too long ago, Masterchief sorta came by and was like 'Hey, it's been awile, want to roleplay'. Despite remembering what happened before, I gave it a shot. I believed he might have changed a little bit. This time around, I had him take control of the story, and he put us in another part of our world. Our characters this time around were different, I had a noblegirl fleeing from a brutal war of sucession, and Masterchief's was yet again another elf, but this time a half-fiend/half elf hybrid lady who happened to be nearby and saved her.  \n\n\nThere was noticeable disparity in quality and care put into describing things, his explanations to things were very bare minimum and didn't feel all that engaging and sorta bored me out. His character was constantly stroking the hair of mine and saying stuff like 'It's okay, i've got your back in this big bad world' or 'How did such a pretty face get into my care?' My character was naturally bothered by this, but the harrassment continued. We kept going a little longer like walking around through the town Masterchief setup and all that, going to a few shops.  \n\n\nI tried to explain a bit of my characters backstory in-character through some small characterizations, she was an artist, a dancer and liked writing and all that. But it was all heavily overshadowed by the Masterchief. He seemed to not really care about it and gave small, non-caring responses about it, and seemed more interested in explaining his stuff. It kept feeling one-sided and I really wanted to bring it up, but just kept soldering on. Masterchief's elf did everything, they knew 7 different fighting styles, was super rich, could become male and female via fiend magic, had hot boiling demonic blood, killed the Tarrasque like it were nothing!  \n\n\nAfter hours of just listening to exposition, the two eventually landed up in some sort of rented-bazaar tent thing.  \n\n\nAnd of course, the much older fiend-elf started getting very sexual in treating mine. Unlike last time, there was no build up to it at all, it just sort of happened. They grew a large penis because fiend magic???? and it became this very gross futanari-hermaprhoditic thing that I didn't enjoy at all. And because of magic, my character enjoyed it regardless and got impregnated and all that gross stuff. Afterwards, made my person cry because that was litterally raped and uncalled for, Masterchief only responded to it with 'It's okay hun, you'll come to like it with time'  \n\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading my rant/advice wanted thing. I don't really want to leave the masterchief, there's so much time invested and all that, but at the same time, I feel like it's pretty much hopeless to continue on. What say you?  \n\n\n  \nTL;DR  \n\n\nCool roleplayer that I thought wasn't too bad proved to be very boring, uninterested in stuff I do, and liked to get into the pants of characters I made and pretty much didn't ask or seem interested in a story.",

            "selftext": "If you saw my last post, you\u2019ll know who TV is. In that post I explained how his characters are practically quiet gods that solve anything and everything flawlessly, just as a Mary Sue would do. Not to mention his characters are excellent fighters!\u2014sarcasm intended.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there, oh no. I\u2019ve been roleplaying with TV for at least three months, and his bad habits don\u2019t pop up every single day, luckily for me. I\u2019m gonna give y\u2019all some insight on something that happened about a month ago. Something that I didn\u2019t think about much when it was happening at the time, but like a day later, I was thinking \u201cwow.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s my story, you ask? Let\u2019s start with the details. The plot of the roleplay is, well, pretty choppy. See, we\u2019d started a whole new roleplay session (1x1 still) after TV decided to make the previous roleplay just a dream. Gotta love those \u201cthis roleplay is going nowhere so let me make it out to be a dream and make the dreamer wake up and begin a brand new plot\u201d clich\u00e9s! Basically, what I just said is exactly what had happened. TV\u2019s character woke up from a dream (the dream was the last roleplay plot thingy), casually went on with his day, and attempted to build the environment up a little. This roleplay\u2019s plot is... uh, actually pretty simple, kinda vague at the same time. TV\u2019s character (inspired by Sherlock Holmes I guess?) falls in love with some female character. That\u2019s it. TV did go OOC and tell me that himself, so here I was, expecting he had it all planned out for his character and the female he asked me to play. Turns out I was wrong. \n\nKeep in mind that the female character wasn\u2019t being played YET. She technically didn\u2019t exist, so I was playing TV\u2019s character\u2019s partner at the time (since this is the Sherlock Holmes detective world). I made my character take a walk when I realized that TV\u2019s plot wasn\u2019t coming together as he had explained it would. In fact, he didn\u2019t. He said something along the lines of \u201c[main character] falls in love with [female character] after he saves her.\u201d Vague, uninteresting, boring. Anyway, my character took that walk, and I decided to set up the conflict since I believe TV was just waiting for something to happen. I do love coming up with wacky conflicts and plots so I didn\u2019t complain; I did it. My character saw some random guys (NPCs) who had a female with them. To my character, the scene just didn\u2019t look normal, since I described the girl as appearing uncomfortable. From there, I came up with the craziest stuff my mind could possibly muster.\n\nI\u2019ll make this next explanation shorter. My character alerts TV\u2019s character of the suspicious NPCs and we both go to track down the criminals (saying it now, they are criminals). I thought \u201cbecause TV\u2019s character is technically Sherlock Holmes, he\u2019ll do some normal detective stuff and be smart about doing things.\u201d I\u2019ve never actually read Sherlock Holmes, so I wouldn\u2019t know if he\u2019s just your average mystery solver lmao if he does do crazy things, lemme know!\n\nContinue. I set up the world so that TV\u2019s character can go in the shady building that the weird NPCs and female went into. To cut it short, TV saved the girl and made friends with the three villains. Somehow?? I didn\u2019t make the villains fight because I knew TV would wipe them out if I tried anything but he acted real smooth towards the villains and made them soft (which I went along with because they\u2019re not the important part. It gets worse.) Anyhoo, one of the NPCs gave TV information about their boss, the person they worked for, and why they were taking this random female character as a hostage. \n\nHeads-up: this is where my storytelling got dark as I usually throw some twist in if I get the chance to build some of the plot. The NPCs wanted to bring the girl to the boss named Vale for experiments. That\u2019s the light way to put it lol. I could go into detail but nah. TV also got information for Vale\u2019s location; some kind of studio/laboratory (not sure where I was going with that.) After TV\u2019s character heard this, he went to the place.\n\nAgain, in short, TV met with the main villain. Wait, I lied. TV magically summoned THE ARMY when I tried to get Vale and their creation (more on that later) away and captured Vale. ARMY soldiers. Like, you\u2019re at a loss where you can\u2019t reach my villain and they\u2019re escaping so you describe ARMY FORCES appearing in the laboratory to detain my villain. At least Vale\u2019s creation (gonna call it P.), technically some monster out of folktale, escaped. I at least had THAT luxury to be able to continue with P.\u2019s storyline.\n\nIf you thought getting the army to randomly appear was bad enough, listen to this. When I described P., it was basically \u201csome kind of deadly wendigo that can only be killed by a specific type of poison.\u201d If that sounds overpowered, I get where you\u2019re coming from but it\u2019s really not. Vale (the main villain, befriended by TV) told TV\u2019s character that she could help him kill off this tyrant with a single dose of special poison she made just in case her experiment went wrong. Since it did, and P. is out for blood, Vale\u2019s prepared. Note that this is a plot lacking powers and abilities.\n\nSo instead of accepting the simple task of injecting the wendigo with a sliver of poison, TV\u2019s character suggests using a rocket launcher instead. At that point I was giggling to myself. But I was like \u201calright, sure, I\u2019ll throw a little twist in that makes my last villain pretty menacing when the rocket launcher idea fails to wipe him out. Something simple. Something creepy. Something that convinces TV to use the poison to end the fight.\u201d\n\nBoy, was I wrong. MORE army soldiers, this time with TANKS roll into the city to chase P. to a warehouse where the fight will supposedly end. All in all, the fight did end, I failed to use that \u201cyou created me, now I\u2019m suffering and I wish to kill you\u201d clich\u00e9 from P.\u2019s point of view directed towards Vale, its respective maker. The wendigo got blown up, blah blah blah, and the roleplay ended. Another one started of course, and maybe I\u2019ll save those experiences for next time ;&gt;\n\nMost of the experiences I\u2019ll post later down the road happened a while ago, just keep that in mind. This wasn\u2019t yesterday so it all ended.",

            "selftext": "It's the middle of a pandemic and the Summer Slump just started. Basically, if you're launching a server now or in the next few months - prepare for it to be pretty slow.   \n\n\nI explained this over and over to my writing partner when he decided he wanted to start his own server. He's a mod in a server I run, and he's been great, so of course I was willing to help him start his own. My server's been running just shy of 2.5 **years** at this point, and he's been in it for 1.5 years. By the time he joined, I'd already done a lot of the heavy lifting. Aside from some reformatting, the lore's been the lore since the start. This is the third Summer Slump we've seen (having launched in February 2018), so I know that things dip around this time and the best medicine for that is to just take your characters and keep on trucking.   \n\n\nIt's just 3 months of trucking. All it takes, really, is one active person writing every other day and the story stays moving. Is it thrilling? No, but it'll get you through and by Fall, you'll see a spike in activity. After the Winter holidays, you'll get another spike. Another in Spring. If you play your cards right, those spikes will see you through the summer slump. It's not that difficult. It just takes some effort.   \n\n\nHe swore he knew that and he wasn't worried. Another mod from my server and I went in on this project with him. I wrote out the lore book, she wrote out the game and monetary system, while my writing partner basically just had veto power and final authority. We built a great story for him, but we also were very clear that it was probably not going to see a lot of action until the Fall.   \n\n\nAs long as we were all patient and did our parts though, it could be a really great thing. So we launched a month ago. The Gaming Mod and I spammed advertisements across a bunch of different platforms and we ended up with 17 characters in a month, not too shabby for a server that was meant to be a smaller scaled game.   \n\n\nBut again, muses dip in the Summer. Pandemic or not, they just dip. People go on vacation, they want to binge shows, sleep in, play video games, do a bunch of other stuff - for whatever reason, the majority isn't joining and playing in group servers. And that's okay. We expected that. We planned for that.   \n\n\nHe, apparently, didn't realize the dip would be as bad as it was. He's used to my main server, where we have strict activity requirements. People might not post every day, but if everyone is posting at least once per 2 weeks, there's always at least one scene going on actively each day. In his server, he didn't want activity requirements. He didn't want people to feel like they had to post or they would risk being kicked. Totally fine, it's his server to run how he wanted. I tried to warn him that would be opening himself up for a lot of lurkers. He didn't listen.   \n\n\nSo what did we get? Of the 17 characters in that server, 7 were played by the Mods on alt accounts just to promote activity. The remaining 10 players came in, made characters, and we never heard from them again. My main server is also my WP's first group game. Admittedly, it's not for everyone. I don't advertise for it as often as I could *because* it's got such a niche demographic that I'd rather the players it's meant for find us instead, so no one's ever mad or feeling like they were tricked into joining. And one of the numerous restrictions of my server is that I don't allow lurkers.   \n\n\nOnce a player has joined, they have two weeks to convey an interest in character creation. If a month goes by and they haven't applied, they're kicked. If a player does join, they have 2 weeks to start playing (unless they tell us they need time away), and if they haven't in 2 weeks, we issue a warning that they have two more weeks to get active or they'll be kicked. I get that WP didn't want to be as strict, but well... look what happened?   \n\n\nBut again, he only gave it a month. The other Mod and I busted our asses to build out the server and organize it for him. Once he launched, we kept busting our asses to handle players, help them make characters, and spark as many scenes as we could so people always had someone to write with. And a week ago, he just gave up.   \n\n\nI knew he wasn't loving it, but this morning, the first thing I saw when I woke up was a message from him that he was closing the server, not to bother to keep writing. I managed to convince him to, instead of shutting it down and deleting everything, just temporarily post-pone the official launch. We kicked out all the other players so it's just Mod accounts in there now.   \n\n\nUgh, it's just really frustrating that he was told over and over to be prepared for this outcome and he only gave it a month before giving up. We've been butting heads a lot lately, due to a whole bunch of other things, so I'm holding my tongue and not saying how I'm feeling about this.   \n\n\nBut I'll say it here.   \n\n\nIf you don't have the patience to do the work and carry your server on your own back through the Slump - just don't make a server. You're not emotionally capable, much less mature enough, to run your own ship. If a measly month is all it takes for you to give up, save everyone the time and just join someone else's story. There are literally thousands of stories just like the one you plan on making out there, run by people who aren't afraid of putting in the work.   \n\n\nAnd to the lurkers - an honorary mention: making a character and then just sitting in a group game, never once playing, doesn't make you a role player. It makes you an inconsiderate waste of time.",

            "selftext": "I'll just say it: sometimes I get daunted by a whole wall of text. I know it's popular to tout \"novella length\" RP where you can type upwards of 500-2,000 words per post, but c'mon, people, sometimes less is more. \n\nDoes anyone else ever find it exhausting? To have to churn out that many words about what your character is wearing, or thinking, or the exact way the moon is shining on the trees, or just a whole long series of actions or dialogue, so that your partner's got to backtrack and try to respond to each thing? Everyone seems so dismissive of one liners, or contemptuous of just typing a few sentences, but I think I'd rather have some actual back and forth than just wade through a whole sea of words each time.\n\nMaybe what I'm looking for is more rapid-fire RP, but I don't really see that mentioned much. The general trend seems to be about quantity, as if the more words you spew out, the better or more \"literate\" of a writer you are. But doesn't anyone else value brevity? Being able to say a lot with a little?\n\nI mean, I get wanting descriptive, immersive RP. And sometimes you've got to set the scene, and that might take several paragraphs; I'm all for that. Hell, I'll even throw in little snippets between my own characters if that helps move the story along. But I feel like it can go overboard into this one-upmanship mentality, like, oh, you typed X number of words, well, I'll type *even more!* I'll match your word-count and raise you 500!\n\nSorry, I know this isn't about a specific bad RPer story. Just a trend I've noticed. Am I the only one who feels this way?",

I simply wanted to do a fandom rp where *gasp* the entire plot wasn't around shipping two canon characters together and changing their personalities to make them mesh. I know oc's in fandom's get a lot of flack but when you know you're one of the ones who puts in a fair amount of effort as well as flexibility to make a suitable character only to have the person block you just because they don't tick their shipping box sucks. Why do fandom rper's seem to make decisions based on their own romantic and shipping wants and decide to toss people aside like a wet when confronted with a character whose purpose wasn't to just lay or be laid?",

            "selftext": "\n\nOkay well, I\u2019ve never done anything like this, but I ran out of places to vent where I feel like I can get helpful feedback? I\u2019ve been seeing AITA posts around and it gave me the idea to talk about things here, please note I am new to this and may over explain things, I just want to make sure I\u2019m fully informing.\n\nI (22F) am an aspiring writer, I since the age of 9 have been creating characters and they have evolved with me mentally and emotionally. Most of my ocs (original characters) are POC or LGBTQ+ not because of forced agenda but because it is how I emotionally feel they should be represented. Almost like, my characters tell me how they wish to be written, if that makes sense, but also I show myself through them, why most are bisexual as I am, and why most have mental issues they must work through, just as I do. Anyways, even as a child I would play pretend as my characters, and as an adult, I was introduced to written roleplay. Basically, you have ocs, they have ocs, and we ship characters and write about their relationship in a back and forth through messaging. Sometimes replies are long and detailed but most are just a paragraph or two. Not to be explicit, but usually in the stories there is a NSFW scene or two between characters, usually to express the head of their relationship coming together (love writing slow burns and stuff)! \n\nAnyways, I have been writing with my current rp partner for some time, about a year and a half. They are great and we are good friends, and we certainly have favorite ships we like to write in new stories. It is a lot of fun and I love fawning over the love we create with our characters. However, one ship we have written, happens to be between a male and female. Nothing on purpose, we just thought they would be good together because of similar traits and just being a good balance for each other. In the first story we wrote for them, it was very romantic and sweet and we did write one NSFW scene for them where they confessed love to one another, very sweet. My partner always expressed how they loved my oc in this ship and the ship itself. I love it too, and became very attached to them. Often when I make a ship with one oc, I like to keep them in that one pairing, and very often it comes back and I write it in my true canon for my ocs. My rp partner and I often share the same feelings, but somewhere along the line their feelings about this ship changed. At first I noticed it when in writing them in new stories, they would often skip things or switch over (we often do multiple ships in one main storyline that overlap and switch between couples whenever the feelings sways us). At first I just thought hey its just their creative way, nothing to worry about. However they soon expressed to be that they purposely avoided writing them, because they made them uncomfortable. At first they said they had no idea why, and I didn\u2019t know how to respond other than say we can do whatever you want to writing wise. Later on they said it had something to do with them being a \u201cstraight couple\u201d even though her oc is bi/pan (im not sure because they havent said officially, but they had said they paired them with men), and my character is demiromantic. I don\u2019t want them to be unhappy and uncomfortable when writing, because the biggest point of this is to have fun and escape reality a bit, its like writing your own drama show basically!\n\nI don\u2019t want to expose my friend, I understand their mental illness just as they understand mine. I suffer chronic depression and generalized anxiety, and take medication for it. They are ADHD and have bipolar, so sometimes they change their mind about things rather quickly. I tend to take things to heart and become very down about things when I feel they are out of my control (hence feeling what I feel now). Very often, they ask to not do the couple in writing, skip over their moments that I am excited to write about. Eventually they said they love the couple, it was just the NSFW part they had issue with. That seemed fine, but it takes a huge part out of writing the relationship. Sometimes they will switch scenes randomly or cut them short when I had things planned to write and that makes me a little sad I was not able to fully express something in the story. We often write without telling each other everything beforehand, we like to surprise each other with twists and such, we only share plans when it needs to be said for the other writer to understand the plot the other is trying to convey.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I would never force them to write anything they did not want to. Also, I would not mind if they told me their character is asexual now, the relationship written could still work. However we have made children for this couple, and often I just try to insinuate attraction between the couple, even as simple as kissing, but even that seems to make them uncomfortable. It makes me feel like they truly do not like them anymore, which I could understand, but they every so often will express they love the couple and want to rp them. I know this is probably something to do with fleeting mood on the couple due to mental illness, but I know deep down they love the ship.. I just have a hard time seeing why they are sometimes uncomfortable with them, this does not happen to any other couple. In attempt to make it easier to write they have tried to change the gender of their oc, but then they do not feel that is what their oc should be. I\u2019m not sure what to do.. it just makes me sad because I get excited to write them, but then have to throw away the plans I make for them or water them down and rush through because they do not want to at the time. I can\u2019t predict their feelings, and I wouldn\u2019t want to say no when they do want to do them, it just makes me sad that this couple doesn\u2019t get the same treatment as the others. I know they are fictional and this shouldn\u2019t affect me as much, but I feel through my characters and often when I write hard scenes I cry with them. They are a part of me, and I feel deeply for them. I don\u2019t ask for solutions, I\u2019m fine with writing whatever when they feel they are wanting to, but I just want to ask for advice on how to deal with my feelings. Telling them I am sad about when we cut them off makes them feel bad.. and that\u2019s the last thing I want them to feel. I don\u2019t want to guilt them for how they feel, and force them to comply with me just because I am disappointed.\n\nHow should I deal with my feelings? I have cried over them because I feel so attached and want them to be happy. I know this is silly to some and hard to understand, but they help me cope.",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna try to keep this short because english is not my first language and there's just gonna be too much to unpack otherwise.\n\nSo, I roleplay on a forum, the userbase is small and consist in a 90% of 'bad roleplayers' going from those who have your standard 'annoying but usually harmless' problems like powerplay to those who take it all way too seriously and live the game like if it was real life and destroy friendships over a not given ship or a fight between their characters, stuff like that. \n\nI  unfortunately  became friend (well she's an ex friend now) with one in the latest category, she seemed cool for almost a year but then the cracks started showing, she snapped at me for not messaging her for like  two days during an holiday going all passive-aggressive saying stuff like she couldn't trust anyone anymore, to then starting to randomly ignore me  justifying  herself saying she was 'oh so busy!' even if she was on the forum responding to the threads she had with her best friend for hours every day and literally everyone could see it. \n\nEventually after four months like that I couldn't take it anymore and after she gave me the daily random excuse on why she  disappeared  I mentioned how she 'seemed to have all the time for a certain someone', she got all defensive, said she wasn't ignoring me on purpose but then admitted she actually didn't mean she was \\*really\\* busy when she would disappear for the entire day. After that I was offended and stopped messaging her, she did the same until she snapped AGAIN and one day just accused me of trying to hurt her on purpose because... I was roleplaying with my usual rp partner, who has been it for 4 years and is the reason I stay on that hell site, more than usual and because I had commented the status of another player she hated. Basically accusing everything I did on game for the 10 days we didn't talk of being a secret plan to be an attack to her \n\nThis time I finally yelled at her too, she apologized but I was too angry and I said so, telling her I didn't want to do anything with her anymore outside of the threads between our characters.\n\nSo, this is the context.\n\nThe issue is: Together we had an almost-ship I really really liked and was very emotionally involved into. I still would like it to happen. But yesterday I messaged her to ask if she was still interested in it (not my proudest moment, I regret it so much lol) and she managed to remind me every single reasons why I hate her. \n\nShe didn't say no to giving me a chance for the ship, she did actually say it was fine for her too and that she thought \\*I\\* was the one who didn't wanted to play it anymore, what bothered me is that I explained to her very clearly I'm one foot out (?) of the forum because I have family problems (which she knows about, my grandmother is sick and will most likely not survive this year) to let her understand one of the reasons I was so slow to respond to our threads now and she had the courage to still mention that if I was so worried she would give ''away'' her character to someone else then I should have been more active and showed more interest in the first place instead of not talking to her for a month. Plus she tried to play the victim about the fight we had, telling me I hurt her for being fed up with her nonsense apparently but that's just the way she is so I expected it.\n\nAm I a dumbass for not having just closed everything with this person? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr  My rp partner insulted me but I'm still hung up on what our characters ''had'' together, is it worth enduring to savage it or it's better and time to let go?",

Open to ideas, amazing at writing and all around just really amazing. I honestly can\u2019t remember a time that I was ignored or ghosted back in those first few years of roleplaying. But god how that\u2019s changed. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed this drastic change in people. Most of them write one liners, most one short sex scenes and none of them seem to really want to expand their horizons when it comes to plots and such. Recently, in these past two or so years, ghosting and being ignored completely has become a problem for me. Not only when it comes to waiting for responses or when we\u2019re planning the plot but I\u2019ve been completely ignored when commenting on ads or sending messages to them even if they were just posted. \n\nNot only that but lots of my ideas has become ignored, even my characters which I put a lot of my heart and soul into. It\u2019s become such a problem that I don\u2019t even know if I want to keep roleplaying, honestly. Everyone on these forums seem to simply want a short smut scene or have such tight requirements that\u2019s it\u2019s honestly sort of ridiculous. \n\nIt seems like this community has become one big clique where only certain ones are allowed to post and attract attention and such. It\u2019s extremely frustrating and I dont know if anyone else has noticed but it seems to be becoming a big issue. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m simply tired of being ignored and ghosted for reasons unknown to me.",

And he even said \"please tell me when you are not okay with what I ask\" \n\nHe starts by saying the usual. He is dominated blah blah, he likes detail, he likes OVERLY sexual roleplays but he \"can throw in come story if we match up\" and all this. Right off I said none of my roles are over sexual that's not my style. He said okay thank you for telling me it's okay. \n\nThen he went to asking me to make my character description OVERLY erotic. Which I said please no. I'm not okay with that since I have enough detail for a mental image and this is a story based role not a sex based role. He then asked if I wanted him to explain \"his penis in great detail\" or if I wanted a photo. I said I do not want either that can wait till lewd scenes you can describe it i guess if you really want to. \n\nHe didn't say anything then said he REQUESTED I call him \"pet names\" like \"baby, honey, sweetie, love, etc\" like, and I quote \"a married couple\" when we talk outside of the roleplay. I said that makes me highly uncomfortable since I didn't even know his name. \n\nHe proceeded to get very mad and say I was \"a pain in the ass\", to talk to just because I was actually saying no to him. \n\nI'm sorry for this rant but it was just the weirdest thing I've ever experienced in like 8 years of roleplaying.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been around the metaphorical block when it comes to roleplay. Having used different sites to find and talk to partners I\u2019ve met a lot of amazing and interesting people. This means I\u2019ve met a lot of not so great people, and I\u2019m not talking about the people I didn\u2019t click with as partners, I\u2019m talking about the crazies. While I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt it has sometimes come back to bite me. So here an older experience I had that I thought might be fun to share. \n\nI\u2019m not one for overtly sexual plots and for the most part prefer for relationships to develop naturally in the RP. I\u2019ve stated this practically every ad I\u2019ve posted looking for partners. But somehow people miss that the most. I\u2019m in the RP hub server on discord and had posted an ad with the basics about myself and what I was looking for. Making sure to state smut must be kept to a minimum as the story should make up at least 80% of the RP.  \nI get a message pretty quickly, from this guy Allen (fake name). Allen starts me off with a simple \u201cHey, wanna RP?\u201d. I ask for a bit more info about him as I had given a pretty decent size one about myself in the ad. He decides that all I need to know is that he\u2019s 24 lives and lives on the west coast. I\u2019m mildly annoyed because he\u2019s yet to say anything about the type of writer he is or even the genres he writes. So I push and ask what he likes to write and finally, he gives me something. He tells me about this plot that he has that he really wants to try out. He goes into extreme detail about it and I was actually pretty excited.\n\nSo we start making characters and it started fine until he started requesting they have certain features from hair color to them having to wear glasses. I\u2019m not really a picky person so I agree. While I\u2019ve stated I don\u2019t want NSFW elements to be the main part of the RP or even have a part besides when it fits, they seem to find it important to request my character be \u201cblesses in the breast and bottom region\u201d, I hesitantly agree, before asking if they expecting NSFW stuff to be a large element, they assure me they aren\u2019t. Okay, we are on the same page then, awesome. We start going into how our characters know each other. He wants them to be married and I want something that hasn\u2019t started yet. I personally get bored with pre-established relationships and told him as such. We go back and forth on it until finally compromising and having them just be dating.   \nWe continue to talk about the plot just fleshing things out. Mind you its a fantasy world. When this happens. \n\nAllen: So what about the bathroom situation. \n\nMe: ...What? \n\nAllen: How do they go to the bathroom?  \n\nMe: I don\u2019t know, normally? \n\nAllen: Okay...can they poop their pants occasionally? It can magically disappear but they can feel it for a little bit. \n\nMe: (trying desperately to be nice, but extremely uncomfortable)...I don\u2019t know  \n\nAllen: You won\u2019t have to describe it all the time, just every now and then! I swear its not a kink thing! \n\nI didn\u2019t respond for a bit because I was honestly kinda shocked but he kept insisting it wasn\u2019t a kink thing and even told me I was the weird one for being ashamed of something natural. The end of the story is that he got blocked and I really think it was a kink thing.",

I hate that most face claims/descriptions tend to not include POC so it makes me feel out of place and all so I end up using of course a white or very light skinned reference/description. Plus I have to worry about whether the person is racist or not. Sad. In this one instance where I thought the person was pretty cool so we started to get to know one another, long story short I told him I\u2019m black and he seemed cool about it so I was like whew, no issues! ...I spoke too soon because what went from a nice slice of life rp turned into him pestering me to do a slavery rp where I\u2019m a slave and he happens to be the master in love. ....\nWhen I expressed how uncomfortable that made me, he thought the better alternative was to do one where he plays a racist man who is in love with a black woman but segregation and such still exists..needless to say he ended up throwing in the n-word when he wrote out the prompt. And to top it all off, he said slavery happened so long ago that I should get over it and shouldn\u2019t be offended.\n\n*HEAVY SIGH*",

It\u2019s also a long story \nThe characters are \nMe as me \nSore Loser as Excel \nMy buddy Zero \nAnd Sore Loser\u2019s buddy who I\u2019ll call V cuz I can\u2019t remember their character name \n\nAnyways, I\u2019d been invited by a friend of a friend\u2019s to an open ended super hero rp. You could choose to be a villain or a hero, I noticed that just about everyone except one other RPer was already a hero. So I chose to be a villain to spice things up, it also ran on an honor system for fighting which wasn\u2019t so honorable. You had scale your character appropriately and they could only reasonably do things so if they were trapped or put into a tight spot without realizing it they couldn\u2019t just get out unscathed. \n\nSo basically the GM of the rp would go along with almost any scenario that you ran by him so I started to scheme some villainy things. Robbing banks and what-not to get some rp going with the heroes of the chat cuz they weren\u2019t really doing anything. That was a mistake cuz the very first encounter I had with them, two of them (V and Excel) showed up and I realized I had a drastically underpowered character when I didn\u2019t do anything to them, they disarmed all of the traps I set, and cut my legs off. \n\nSo I kept scheming, testing Excel and V with disastrous results as they wouldn\u2019t approach me unless they had two on one sometimes two characters controlled by the same RPer so they\u2019d be guaranteed to win. And generally do things that seemed like a bit much even for a super hero. \nThat is until I started a very very devious plan, I invited another friend (Zero) over who joined me in my villainy, acquired a lot of \u201canti power juice\u201d that the police use against villains in various ways, set up a trap and waited. \n\nIt all started very well, as the hero Excel rushed in, had his powers disabled and was at my mercy. Then he of course had a character that he JUST introduced that day find him in an abandoned warehouse without prior knowledge of his location like he stalks the hero, and saves him from my grasp. I accept it as that wasn\u2019t all I had planned, so I run for now as V arrives for backup.\n\nThat\u2019s when Zero unveils in the midst of the hostages I had for a hook, of course V is able to save everyone somehow or another and my character gets into it with Excel\u2019s other character. At this point it looks like I\u2019ll actually win, it\u2019s so stacked against the heroes it looks like the villains will pull a win.\n\nBut of course Excel couldn\u2019t lose, he somehow regains his powers (the anti power stuff had like 3 day block or something, as in he shouldn\u2019t have his powers back), gets 3x stronger than he was before and in one message says that he just punches a hole through Zero and my character and instantly kills them.\n\nWe all got into an argument and that rp didn\u2019t last very long after that\nThank you for listening as I need others to hear about an RPer who just didn\u2019t want to lose.",

            "selftext": "Some accounts who are good roleplayers writing-wise and personality-wise out of character are some of the slowest to respond and they can be so inactive in my opinion but it can be about quality and not quantity sometimes in my opinion. What are your thoughts on those kinds of people and how long are you willing to wait for a reply from a roleplayer? How long do you usually make someone wait for a reply in roleplaying with you?\n\nAnother question I have is if someone roleplays with you well and you clique but then soon after you've talked a bit they decide to not message but continue to be interacting/active with other roleplayers. Then they make you wait and wait and it's been at least a week already and still nothing. Then you give them a nudge. Things go back to normal for a bit. Then soon after you end up having to double message them again. Is this just a coincidence you think? They don't complain to you about the double messages but still, it makes me feel annoying.\n\nIf they say once at least after you double message checking in on them that they are working on themselves or weren't feeling good then it should be understood but if it keeps happening then how should you handle it as a loyal roleplayer? I always respond to all my messages whether I roleplay as an original character or have a roleplay account as a fictional character roleplaying with other people. I don't make people wait even 5 days for a response either.\n\nOne of the roleplayers in question for a certain character recently closed storylines for their character and kept some I was one of them. Now though they are being distant and making me double message again for the fourth time in only 2 months since I started roleplaying with them.\n\nI fear they will drop me next. Not to mention I posted about my cat dying the same day literally an hour before they posted they were cutting off roleplays publicly on their Tumblr. I feel like they read my post and that it could be a mutual of mine behind the account following me on their personal blog and they saw it and just decided it would be wrong to end their RP with me even though I only started to contact them barely 2 months ago. It just feels grimey. I don't know what to think. Please help me. What's some advice on what I should do? Thank you for reading this.",

I've been RPing for over a decade now and I've noticed that as I RP longer, I've become less forgiving with people who are low effort.\n\nWhat do I mean by low effort? Making a character who isn't a character of action. By character of action I don't mean a character who is strong, but a character who is doing stuff rather than standing around like a wet towel.\n\nSometimes it feels like that is an excuse for me to carry the story and honestly, writing isn't a one person or the other thing with roleplay; it's a joint effort. I've found myself more abd more looking for strong female characters because at least then it seems that the character by default will be a character of action and will have a drive.\n\nThat being said, one of my best characters I've had for seven years now is a wimp, but there are pros there. He is talkative, moves, asks questions, and is all about knowledge rather than sitting like a plate of wet spaghetti.\n\nAnd for the love of god, stop saying \"So, what did you want to do with your plot?\" You haven't even told me what character you want to play, how am I supposed to come up with anything? And nothing makes the RP feel more like a grind than if you don't plot with me or work with me to create this story.\n\nHonestly, this shit makes me wonder why I rp anymore. I'm getting tired of ghosting people who look promising at first then just provide nothing to the story.",
