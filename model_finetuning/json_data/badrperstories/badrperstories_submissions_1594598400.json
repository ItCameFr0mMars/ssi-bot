It's been nearly a year since I've had to search for new partners and I completely forgot what a pain it is.\n\nI just don't see why, in a hobby that is basically all about reading and writing, people have so much trouble actually reading an rp ad.  I put up an ad on a few 1x1 websites over the last week.  I mentioned that I only play females, I only do sfw rp, and that it will take me 2-3 days to respond to posts.\n\nResults: \n\n\\-A bunch of people asking me for a kink list\n\n\\-Someone liking one of my ideas, but only plays against males\n\n\\-A person who said they'd only rp when we're both online and expects at least 3 posts a day.\n\nI did manage to get a couple promising replies, but then ran into another problem.  I know that rpers aren't always the best at communicating, but some people just seem incapable of making any sort of choice.  I do try to account for that by taking the lead, but sometimes I do want an input on your preferences.  I try to give clear options: Preference A, Preference B, or No Preference.  I just sort of feel like when one of the options is literally not picking an option, getting an answer shouldn't be like pulling teeth.\n\nIn the end, I did end up finding a good RP partner, but I thought I'd share some of struggles of getting there.",

Let me also add that ***this is not a post that is meant to invoke a debate about whether or not face claims should be used.*** If you have an issue with face claims, take it up with someone else because this isn't the place for that.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has this pet peeve, but it always gets under my skin when people ask what face claim(s) I will be using before they even ask me anything about my character(s). I understand that some people might do this so that they don't end up picking the same face claim (which honestly what are the odds of that since there are so many to choose from), but you would think that asking about a person's character as a PERSON rather than as a face would be more important than who they're using as a visual representation. I've also noticed that the same people who do this tend to be really prone to rushing into smut and/or into trying to form ships before any solid posting has actually even occurred. They're the people who sometimes demand someone to play certain face claims regardless of personality the writer attaches to that face claim just to satisfy a (mostly sexual) fantasy. It's obnoxious and at that point it becomes clear to me that more often than not, they're not there for the story. Anyone else have a similar experience?",

I\u2019m not completely innocent, because I was an annoying little shit\u2014but I was also eleven or twelve years old. We were all annoying little shits in various angry phases back then.\n\nI was a well-established member on an online roleplay forum. One day, while making USSR \u201cin Soviet Russia, X Ys you\u201d jokes in the chatbox with my friend\u2014who was replying with America \u201cfreedom and bald eagles\u201d jokes in turn\u2014I had the genius idea to change my username to \u201ccommunist\u201d. What, I thought, could possibly go wrong?\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\n1. I didn\u2019t know what communism was, apart from \u201cthe government does things\u201d.\n2. I thought communism had died with the fall of the USSR. My only knowledge came from the Cold War unit in sixth grade.\n3. **I wasn\u2019t actually a communist, and apart from obvious jokes, I never indicated that I was one. I was just trying to be funny.**\n\nEnter \u201cMark\u201d.\n\nMark might have been an FBI agent transported forward in time from the 1950s, always on the prowl for Soviet spies. He acted like it, at any rate. When he saw my fancy new username, he immediately started questioning me like we were in the McCarthy era: name two communist countries, etc. His grand finale? \u201cClose your Wikipedia tab and tell me what communism is.\u201d \n\nI was lost. I was really, really lost. I didn\u2019t have the first clue as to what communism entailed\u2014for fuck\u2019s sake, I had to Google \u201ccommunist countries\u201d to name two of them\u2014and just stammered off something about property. He was ridiculously smug about my terrible answer before another user engaged him in debate, distracting him. \n\nI was relieved, but that wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nMark started making nasty remarks whenever he saw me online. I was briefly appointed as a mod, and he said the site was going to shit or something similar. It\u2019s been years, so I don\u2019t remember much, but I know he insulted me frequently and I wanted to send him a .gif of Regina George saying, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d\n\nSadly, the ending is pretty anticlimatic. No one did anything about Mark, if I recall correctly. I abandoned my mod duties (I was a terrible mod anyway) and ditched the site without fanfare.\n\nMoral of the story: Never assume that an eleven-year-old has read enough political theory to be an undercover Soviet spy, no matter what Cold War propaganda tells you.",

I have strayed away from roleplaying with individuals that run a \"roleplay\" blog heavily filled with political content because based on previous experiences, they almost always wish to discuss some political topic ooc or even ic which for me, completely defeats the purpose of roleplaying. Roleplaying is meant to be a fun, relaxing hobby and well, discussing politics especially as of recently is anything but.\n\nSo I get a response to one of my wanted roleplayer ads, I look through this individual's blog, seems to be a solid roleplay blog full of character studies, plots, etc. We talk a little back and forth until this happens:\n\nThem: hey i couldn't help but notice that you don't have anything on your blog relating to spreading awareness for BLM and drawing attention to racial inequality ?\n\nMe: It's my roleplaying blog\n\nThem: i mean this is my roleplaying blog too haha but it's good to spread awareness for these causes, you know ??? the theme of the blog shouldn't matter\n\nMe: Ok but it's my roleplaying blog and I don't want to shove politics into my hobby.\n\nThey go on to say that I am being \"insensitive\" to everything going on in the world, that they're uncomfortable roleplaying with someone who \"doesn't care about people being slaughtered in the streets and only cares about their blog theme\", and basically just assuming my political stances when I haven't made any claims towards one side or the other.

Each time I would make an oc, he would copy it, maybe change up the power a bit, (such as if mine could shoot purple plasma beams, his could shoot green ones) give it a name, maybe change the sexuality and age and then get approved every time. One time he wanted to completely copy my character, he said the excuse is that they could be twins. I said no because I only make relations with people I trust, he got all huffy puffy about it and the changed the last name, added a year to her age and got approved. I went to the admins and they didn't see a problem, this wasn't just characters too! He could purposely misgender someone, call them a slur, post NSFW in the wrong chats, and harrass people and the admins would look the other way. I'm fed up.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! So here it is: I started an **amazing** RP with a new partner. At first he seemed just as excited as I was, if not more. We created a server with multiple channels, discussed about the world building (religions, politics, characters and story) and set everything up. \n\nWe both loved each other\u2019s characters and our starters posts. I was the one that responded to his post from reddit originally and in there he mentioned he wanted a partner who responded daily and I could do that. We started the RP and as he had mentioned, we would both respond one time per day usually at night. \n\nHe even expressed how much he was enjoying the RP and how interesting our characters were, he was excited to continue. YEY! (He would appear as \u201conline\u201d in discord)\n\nBut then .... nothing. Four days passed and he tells me he\u2019s been feeling down and just needs some time. Now, when I do RP I always befriend my partner and really care about them. So I text him back saying he shouldn\u2019t apologize and if he needed I would be there if he wanted to talk. I asked him if he was sure he wanted to continue the RP and he says \u201cI\u2019m sure Im going to continue the RP. I love the story and the characters. I take ghosting very seriously and I won\u2019t do it to you\u201d.\n\nFast forward four days and nothing, but then I start to get worried about him and no the RP itself. So I send a message to check on him. He says he\u2019s doing fine. We talk for a while and then .... nothing again. \n\nIt\u2019s been 8 days. I haven\u2019t been blocked lol and he\u2019s still in the server. But he never shows up as online. \n\nI guess my question is/questions are:\n- do I send a message asking how he is? \n- do I wait more time to message him? \n- how long should I wait? \n\nAnd the ultimate message (which I don\u2019t know if I want the answer to lol)\n- have I been ghosted ... yet again?",

And I'm doing more ATLA RPs but so many have terrible OCs with horrible tropes and cliches attached to them.

I've run into terrible OCs and it's so off-putting that I can't see myself dealing with their dumpster fire. However I don't want to be mean about it. Is there a tactful way to rescind interest to a story when someone presents a poor character concept or plot without being too blunt?\n\nI've considered asking if they had any other ideas or if they'd be open to presenting me with a few and we could narrow down concepts from that and give them the ultimate say once we're both okay with either option. But at the same time, some people may come up with three terrible OC concepts...\n\nAny thoughts?",

This one time is one of those situations.\n\nI was on some dragon RPG website, where you breed derguns and battle them, etc. It's not very active. You could post a RP ad and it would sit there as the latest post for *at least* two weeks. Sometimes a month. I posted an ad looking for a RP partner, and knowing that dragons are the main topic of the website I decided I'd do that. My rules were simple - i don't do nsfw or fetishes because of site rules, and you need to give me at least two paragraphs (what the site commonly referred to as semi-lit.)\n\nwell, someone responded to my ad in private messages. If I remember right, the message was \"RP?\"\n\nI have learned people who just say \"RP?\" usually are not the kind of person I'm looking for. I gave this one a chance, as I was desperate for a partner on an otherwise dead website. I told them sure, and if they have a plot in mind, because I wasn't sure how fond I was of my own.\n\nand uh. apparently they didn't read my rules, because the response was \"Well I was thinking I could play a fat girl dragon and you could play a fat guy dragon, and then she could feed him until he gets fat.\"\n\nand just like that i never came back :')\n\nI could have handled the situation WAY better than I did, but I've seen that person on other site sister sites of that dragon one, and sometimes when people turn them down the freak out. so i took the easy way and left like the coward I am-",

Theres this one member in the Rp chat that is probably one of the rudest people I have ever met. She constantly makes comments about how she hates evryone in the group and calls people idiots all the time, shes also extremely sociopathic saying things like \u201cwow I wish I cared\u201d when somone talkes about somthing going on in there life. \n\nTo give a personal example, I\u2019m a trans woman and I was talking about a situation going on involving doctors refusing to help dying patients because they don\u2019t agree with there sexuality. And she said \u201cI\u2019m glad doctors can do that.\u201d And when I talked about trans visible awareness day she said \u201cI hate those kind of people.\u201d Knowing full well I am \u201cthose kind of people\u201d. \n\nAnd thats just the tip of the iceberg with this girl. For some reason Evereyone wants to keep her around. I\u2019ve talked to the leader about her many times and nothing is ever done. But anytime I blow up on her I get a penalty. Well after a random turn of events I ended up becoming the chat leader, and now I have the power to get rid of her. Thing is everyone is basically saying if I ban her they are going to leave, so I\u2019m Litrally being held at gun point to deal with her. I\u2019m so done",

            "selftext": "This is from.. I think a year ago, maybe two. Hopefully it won't be terribly long. So I put out feelers for some RP partners on another site, and I got a response for a Creepypasta roleplay. I contacted the person, and got my first red flag. No capital letters, text speak, improper grammar. Oh joy. I went with it on the off chance that they would be fun to RP with, and created a private group for us to roleplay in.\n\nThey told me they would be roleplaying as five of their friends who left them in middle school, for some reason??? For privacy's sake, they referred to the characters as 'A, B, C, D, and E'. I was losing hope. They asked me to roleplay as Slenderman, which was the character I had asked others roleplay as in the ad. I was now officially dying.\n\nI went with it though, and wrote up a short starter in script since they had told me that they roleplay in script format (*~~I have nothing against script format- one of my best internet friends prefers that style, I just prefer lit/para when I'm writing my replies 99% of the time~~*). The reply I got.... Was... Bad. I deleted the private chat shortly after their response, so I'll do my best to write what I remember (and I'll try to get this as word-for-word as I can). Keep in mind that their characters were all humans- no powers, not Creepypastas... 100% humans.\n\n\"A: \\*makes a dad joke\\*  \nB: are you slenderman?  \nC: \\*laughs at A's joke\\*  \nD: im gonna find some cake  \nE: is that jeff the killer?!\"\n\nNote: I never said I was RP'ing as Jeff the Killer. I prefer to have some warning before someone just tosses a character at me, otherwise I get pissed (I need some time to get into the mindset). Shortly after their reply, having been dumbfounded for a few minutes, I told them I wouldn't be continuing the RP. Long story short, they blew up on me, and I deleted the group and blocked them.\n\nI had a small paragraph written in script, did my best to write up where Slenderman was and what he was doing... And they literally handed me the worst of generalizations. The only character who was surprised was E- and it wasn't even about Slenderman! Like... If you suddenly met Slenderman in the woods and realized he was real, wouldn't you freak the frix out?!\n\nI've thankfully never had an RP partner as bad as that since, but that interaction... It still crosses my mind every now and again.\n\nIf you roleplay with someone... Y'know... It's kind of polite to make your character reactions... Believable? Have sustenance??? ANYTHING?!... Primus, sorry... This... This memory still pisses me off. Ya'll have a good day/night/whatever it is where you are. I just.. Felt like sharing this weird n' short crap experience.",

They also love to introduce plenty of non-sensical nerfs. I once had a real life technology idea nerfed to hell because they \u201cjust don\u2019t like it\u201d and also had plans to introduce a similar thing that mine would interfere with. \n\nMy entire nation was running on Quark fusion(fusing quarks to generate 8 time\u2019s as much energy and nuclear fusion. Quarks take up a lot of energy to create though.) for decades, then one day he posts an article about how Quarks take too much energy to create and wouldn\u2019t be practical power sources. So boom, my entire power grid is dead. I\u2019d actually be fine with this in any other circumstance, but this is an RP where we can magically create as much antimatter as we want en-masse via \u201ccharge inversion\u201d and another guy literally has the ability to just *create* matter of all forms via magic crystals with no energy input at all. But yeah Quarks are too hard to make. \n\n\nThis is just one example. I can\u2019t go a few days without a major plot element being retconned, or with nonsensical nerfs ruining my day.",

            "selftext": "Update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/gufa37/ic_arguments_and_ooc_resentment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\n\nIt had been a month of them ghosting me after I had tried to make things right with them. I said we could do something else if they wanted to and I apologised if I offended them to which I got no response for, again, a month.\n\nAround a week ago I got particularly irritated about something and messaged them again about how immature what they did was and then I unfriended them on discord. I was angry about it for a long time.\n\nWe had run into each other multiple times on a roulette site and made stories but I had to abandon them entirely after finding out their username.\n\nEventually they gave their username and said that if they knew me they were sorry. I was conflicted but decided to try and talk it out with them.\n\nTheir apology...was barely an apology. The only thing they really apologised for was how they handled the situation, but they still had this belief that my character was totally and completely in the wrong. They described him as being \"unsympathetic and playing the victim\". In fandom talk when someone says a character is unsympathetic, it means that they are pitch black on the grey morality scale. Absolutely wrong in every way.\n\nThey also described the rp itself as 'toxic' and it's a very big pet peeve of mine when people describe things as toxic. It's a more personal thing, but it still irritated me, especially since I was essentially being called toxic myself.\n\nBut, I dealt with the apology, not realizing how much it blamed me and my character for what happened until I read it for the third time.\n\nWe continued to play a different story but I had this nagging feeling in the back of my mind the whole time. It was hard to look at their pastel profile picture without feeling some kind of dread.\n\nI asked them later why they didnt try to resolve things whenever I had apologized if I offended them and they basically said that they were angry at the time, which is fine.\n\nThen after a while I tell them that their apology kind of seemed like it was blaming me. To which they didn't respond but kept writing the story with me. To me that says that they don't want to tell me that I'm not at fault. \n\nSo the irritation that I had already been feeling boiled over whenever their character was doing the typical annoying-but-not-too-terrible thing where my character is trying to make conversation with theirs, but their character just...isn't responding.\n\nAnd I sent them exactly this:\n\n\"Sorry I thought I wasn't angry anymore but I find that I honestly still am. I know that I shouldnt be angry by now but your apology really came across as blaming me. [My character] was not unsympathetic and he was not playing victim. At a certain point, he was the victim. Read back in the chat and try to see it from [MC] perspective. It also bothers me when people say that things are toxic whenever they are not because I know what toxicity is. To a point I feel like you dont like me and only really like my writing, honeslty. And I dont really think that I like you too much as a person. Not saying you're a bad person, just that I don't like you that much. And I would feel better if I just didn't associate with you. Sorry if this upsets you but it's probably better for the both of us.\"\n\nIt's probably not the best worded and maybe comes across snippy at times, but I felt like it got my emotions across pretty well. And then I unfriended them and closed the DM so that I didnt have to look at their profile picture anymore. Hopefully never to be seen again.",

            "selftext": "This is my first post here after lurking and I've gotta say I definitely have a story. This is what turned me off from ever hosting a server again.\n\nI had an RP server on Discord, the general idea of the RP was a small western town out in Arizona; during the time of cowboys and the gold rush. Not only were there cowboys but there were witches, werewolves, vampires and all sorts of creatures and magic. I played two characters, who sort of acted not only as characters but moved the story along whenever something stalled or needed some spicing up. \n\nWe had a total of about ten people, it wasn't big or anything like that but it was still fun. We all got along and we all enjoyed our time on there. It got to the point where we all decided that maybe we should advertise and invite some new people in. So I made a post on a rather popular sub for those types of things, and someone joined!\n\nNow I'm the server there was a lore section, and an area describing the characters people could play. Mind you in the town it was a mix of humans and creatures, though the humans were unaware of the magic/creatures living among them. It was pretty much laid out that a person could be a human, witch, werewolf, vampire, ghost, Fae OR a human/(insert creature from the provided list here).\n\nThis jabroni didn't even seem to read the rules, lore or character guidelines. After his brief intro he posted a character that was a human x demon x angel x vampire hybrid. And he wore all black leather, totes two six shooters, had red eyes and didn't speak much. He was a bounty hunter killing other magical creatures for money and sometimes sport (because tragic backstory) and was \"kind of psycho but could blend in with normal people\".\n \nThis was top notch character plotting, so I kindly told him \"Hey sorry, that's not gonna fly. He stands out too much and it's kind of over the top even for magic cowboys. Maybe tone it down?\"\n\nSurprisingly he agreed and changed him to a human x witch hybrid, who had a more normal appearance but was still an edgy bounty hunter, I let it slide cause I know the type and there was no use fighting him on it. So he comes I to town and everyone is whispering and talking about this new guy. He finds my characters saloon and right off the bat starts asking about witches and magic, which again clear violation of the lore.\n\nBut we play along and our characters (two witches, one vampire and a werewolf) act like he's crazy and say those things aren't real. So he pushes and pushes and keeps insisting that he's \"tracked down a few of them and they've all lead him to here.\"\n\nSo after a few back and forths like this, my one character finally takes him aside and says \"listen I know what you're talking about just meet me out back.\"\n\nSo the scene changes and both my characters show up, and they're having a rather one sided convo with this guy, while that's going on he asks me in OOC if we have permadeath or how that works. I said \"Yeah, we do but it's mostly NPC's or the villain of the plot that dies. Or sometimes if we want new characters or something we'll kill off one of ours and start a new person. But it's RARE.\"\n\nSo mid scene this dude pulls out his six shooters and in one fell swoop of a paragraph, he kills my two characters. Point blank shoots them in the head. The two characters that I had played with and built up for almost a year had been killed. I stopped the RP and in OOC told him he couldn't do that and that we don't control other people's characters. He needed to delete the post and put something else up, because that's not cool. He refused, so I deleted it for him. But I guess he copied it cause it showed up again. This went on for a few seconds and finally I banned him and blocked him.\n\nI guess he wasn't happy cause he came back with dummy accounts and kept posting the death of my characters. Over and over again and finally it just got to the point that no one could play or enjoy themselves.\n\nSo we had to close the server and we tried starting a new one but the whole thing just felt tainted. And unfortunately we had to end out cowboys and magic RP. Which sucks cause I really liked that one.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: I nearly got kicked out of an extremely unformatted roleplay with awful characters because I typed long responses. \n\n \n\nThe other day I joined this Harry Potter Roleplay server that I was super excited about because it was small and everyone seemed in the same age range. I typed out my character and I was waiting for everyone to be on at the same time to start the roleplay. \n\nSo we begin, the other members are typing out unformatted sentences and one, maybe two liners. Because I'm the only Hufflepuff character in the server, I'm typing out longer, one to two paragraph responses just so I can occupy my time and provide depth to this otherwise meh roleplay. I type out my action, thoughts, and dialogue before someone pings me on the general page and tells the server ( really me and this other girl ) that we don\u2019t need such long responses. I ignore it and do my own thing, sending one final response to the chat. It's dead quiet. I really don\u2019t think much of it because people have things to do and might not be able to respond right away.\n\nI get another ping, this time a DM. The server owner contacted me and said this: \n\nOwner: Hey I'm going, to be honest, the others want me to kick you and (the other girl in question)  because of the way you write \n\nMe: oh \n\nOwner: I don't agree with them but there even going as far as to make another server so it's clear the just want that there not going to take part in this I'll see if I can get new people on the server instead but I can't promise anything \n\nMe: jeez alright. thanks for the heads up :l. I appreciate you telling me, thanks again Owner: Ill try and keep the server going \n\nMe: sorry, I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. \n\nOwner: No I didn't realize the others were like this \n\nMe: Do you think if I typed shorted responses it would calm the tension down? \n\nOwner: I don't think that will work The have already made a new server But I'm not going down without a fight \n\nMe: Omfg Wow I really appreciate this. Thanks again\n\nSeriously??? They're that mad that I and this other individual are typing one to two responses they do this??? I honestly can\u2019t believe this. Not anywhere in this server did it say there\u2019s a limit to how much you can type. \n\nJust to show how awful these people\u2019s responses are here are a few examples I plucked out of this riveting roleplay. \n\n*still frowning that he isnt in ravenclaw anymore* \n\n*frowns some more and goes in* \n\n*grabs some food and starts eating delicately*\n\n *walks by and heada to someplace to practice magic* \n\nThere are way too many awful responses just like these. \n\nI would also like to mention how utterly AWFUL these characters are!! OMFG, they\u2019re BAD. I dont usually bash other people for their characters because mine could use some improvement, but DEAR LORD! They\u2019re bad!!\n\nOne of them switched houses, from a Ravenclaw to a Gryffindor, halfway through their time at Hogwarts. Is that even possible?  \nAnother was adopted by the Malfoy family\u2026.? But later gets adopted by Snape\u2026? Or Snape turns out to be their father\u2026?\n\nAnd another can shoot fire\u2026 out of their hands\u2026?  \nI really wish I was making this up. Not to mention, each character in the houses is a very plain stereotype of each house. The other Hufflepuff ( that joined while this whole fiasco is going down ) is wimpy and nervous. The Slytherins are rude and all purebloods. The Ravenclaws are reclusive and bookworms that are all at the top of the class, who walk and eat with books in hand. And the Gryfindoors have no personality. \n\nAgain, I really wish I was making this up. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll stay in the server because they already don\u2019t like me, they are avoiding me, and it\u2019s not fun to roleplay by yourself. So yeah\u2026 I don't blame the owner of the server for any of this, hell, I don't blame anyone for this. I just soon hope that everyone learns how to make better characters and rapid-fire responses, although practical arent always the best.",

            "selftext": "So basically, I rp from time to time with a group of friends with our DM\u2019s own universe (creator of Lycanite\u2019s Mobs, might\u2019ve heard of it). People come in from time to time to look at the lore, but the depth and specifics of it usually drive away RPers. Eventually, we had two people come in.\n\nThe first story is about one who had a very bad issue with rejection. While he wanted his character to be half draconic, our lore didn\u2019t allow that. We recommended vampirism, which in our lore is the use of Fae magic to alter one\u2019s body, but he didn\u2019t exactly agree with it. Some time passed and one instance later, we set up his character. I\u2019m a bit foggy on the following events, but I remember he rejected the solutions we gave him to issues he thought would get his character killed \u201cpurposely\u201d, resulting to him quitting the rp.\n\nLater on, another person joined. He created a very basic \u201cvillain\u201d character which we recommended more unique characters to him. He... I\u2019m not sure how to explain it. He just didn\u2019t listen to what we told him. He was too concerned about food or water or another thing, boarding himself off from actually going through the rp.\n\nNot very crazy stories, but hey, they\u2019re stories",

You get those who are all powerful and win every fight with ease, or you get those that trip every chance they get and hide under the table because of a loud noise and the balance always seems to be off for their character.\n\nIt's one thing to play someone who wants to become a knight and be weak at first then develop their strength over the course of the rp until their a high and mighty knight and that's okay so lonh as you keep appropriate weaknesses like fear or a sword move that they can't quite master. It's another thing, to be someone who is a scaredy cat to stay a scaredy cat the whole time. Flatline characters are not fun to be around.\n\nIf you're gonna start out as a strong witch hunter then don't go tripping over a tree root and fall unconscious because that isn't realistic. If you're gonna start strong then act strong.\n\nI just can't deal with overpowering characters or really weak characters because it's boring and the outcome is always the same.",

            "selftext": "I just joined a new role playing group on Discord. I'm usually a little iffy about new things. Something about being an old dog, blah blah blah, I don't like new tricks. But I do recognize that new tricks and writing with new people helps me stay inspired to create better stories of my own, so I try to push myself.   \n\n\nI joined this pretty promising server that let me play a character trope that I've been wanting to play for something like 15 years now, I just never found the right story to fit a character like this in and eventually I gave up. I found it's a lot easier to find a story to fit a mage with water-elemental abilities than it is to find a well run story that allows for water sprites/deities. But I found one. It was just starting out, so I went in expecting disappointment, but they actually had a pretty decent lore book with a GM who genuinely cares and is welcoming to new players.   \n\n\nI really love that about this story.   \n\n\nThe issue is that some of the newer players who have come in are... One expressed that they didn't like how much I write. I'll be the first to admit, I can be long winded. I never said they had to match me. I, in fact, said \"it's okay, I type a lot, no worries. Just give me something I can respond to.\" That really doesn't need to be much. What they did instead was basically insult my character and then start negging them.  \n\n\nThis might be old school thinking for me, but I guess I'm more used to writing with players that go with the whole improv rule of \"Yes, and...!\" Instead, he gave me a paragraph and a half (bless him for that, I know he was pushing himself and I appreciate that) of just blatantly insulting my character, following it up with inviting her out after hours.  \n\n\n Obviously, my character was like \"you just verbally backhanded me, and now you want me to meet you in a dark park when there's a killer on the loose? Um... no, thank you?\"   \n\n\nThen someone else chimes in. It's a personal pet peeve of mine when people post OOC messages in IC channels, especially when there's an OOC channel right above it. Just tag people and ask in there. It pulls me right out of character when I'm struggling to discern what is character-hooplah and what is said by a mun. Not my server though, so I tagged them in the ooc channel and responded \"sure! The more the merrier!\"   \n\n\nThey gave one sentence. One very short sentence about their character walking into the room and glaring at everyone.   \n\n\nBetween them and the other person in that scene who was basically just ignoring everything my character did and said in exchange for trying to intimidate my character with their demonic red eyes... when my character's a river deity... I just... I'm done. I don't know what else to do with this scene, so my character's just interacting with a dozen NPCs, and *I'mma dancin' with my se-elf.*   \n\n\nI'm actively not shaming anyone for their post length. I know I tend to be super introspective, so I'm trying to work on adding more actionable content to my posts. I'm holding back on how much I usually write, because I know they're not used to novella styles. If I only get two lines, that's *fine* but please give me SOMETHING to work with.   \n\n\nThere's only so many times my character is going to try to engage with someone else's, constantly getting clapped down by Edgie McEdgelord before I just give up. It's disheartening, because I was SO excited to finally get to play in a story where there's gods of all different religions in a melting pot. Why bother joining a scene if all you're going to do is ignore the others in the scene? Who are you writing with?",

He messaged me about my plot, saying he was glad to find one that isn't based entirely on smut, saying that he doesn't like only smut, he's a grown-up, not a child etc. TBH i have no issue with people who do want only smut, you do you. I wouldn't, but I'm not going to insult those who do want it by calling them childish. still, i ignored it\n\nWhen we then moved to discord, he began to talk about how he liked torture, how he \"lived as a woman\" (he did drag, he wasn't trans, he didn't live as a woman basically) and how he was a domme. I said it was odd and made a joke about BDSM being smut. he went off on me.   \n\n\nWhatever, I moved on. We got into the RP, and I noticed a lot of things he did weird. he spelled words wrong repeatedly. He said he was dyslexic so I didn't say anything, but dyslexia doesn't cause the kind of grammar mistakes and spelling errors this guy made. Then, he began ranting again about how smut RP is stupid. So, I brought up the fact that the first thing he said to me in discord was how he is into BDSM. That's pretty NSFW, maybe don't throw stones from glass houses? I put this in more polite of a way than I have here, since I was trying to be nice and trying to get this guy to think about what he was saying.  \n\n\nHe went off on me again, telling me I was a sheep and a contrarian, being incredibly rude. he messaged me really mean, horrible things for about an hour. I tried to be polite, I apologised that he felt that way and said we should part ways. he continued to message until I unfriended and left the server, at which point he messaged my reddit, saying \"i hope you find forgiveness you did not give me,\" even though I apologised and was trying my best to be nice. I recognise I probably shouldn't have argued about it, but this guy kept complaining about others, again and again, so I thought I should bring up my own opinion (which he then said was me trying to shut him up), and he just doesn't sit right with me. So I check through his post history and comment history and holy shit, he's an asshole. He's overly emotional, incredibly hit-or-miss and incredibly unstable. I'm glad I got out as early as I did.\n\n\"Go ahead and ban me, subs just pass me around like a roofied promdate\" and similar things. He causes arguments with others who are just trying to be nice etc. If I end up finding out he killed 3 people, I wouldn't be surprised.  \n\n\nSo yeah, that guy's weird. I've blocked him now, but still. Just a very unsettled person.",
