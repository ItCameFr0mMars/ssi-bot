            "selftext": "So I\u2019m pretty active  on reddit looking for a partner to roleplay with. I\u2019m not very picky except I like someone who can add details, improvise, and just keep a plot going. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so mad at a partner before roleplay even began before. This person had a post looking for a partner that I responded to about a week ago and he said he got too many responses and was full. This was fine. Then a few days later he had another post looking for a partner so I responded to that one as well and said I\u2019d want to do a fantasy roleplay. He said he had pre commissioned characters he wanted to use so I asked to see them so I could improvise a good fit to match with his character, but he said no. He said he didn\u2019t want me to get attached to any of his characters before the story began. So I thought... okay well I\u2019ll make my own character and just go from there. I sent him a picture of the character I wanted to play and he said no, that he didn\u2019t vibe with her. I asked if he had any sort of direction for me after that and he said \u201cno I usually don\u2019t have problems with characters except...\u201d so I blocked him. \n\nI was absolutely so mad. The audacity of this person... he expected me to wait around until he needed a partner, he even said he was afraid I \u201cghosted\u201d him after I responded to his posts and he waited days to get back to me. I was just gone for one day due to some personal stuff... Then he tries to tell me what character HE wants ME to play but I have NO SAY in what character he plays???? No thank you. Absolutely not. Blocked. Do not expect to roleplay with me if you can\u2019t decide on anything except what you don\u2019t want.",

Most people are cool with that.   I wrote a reply to one of my partners before work, she wrote one back and then asked when I'd be able reply next.  When I got home, I told her I'd write one the next morning because I am busy that night.\n\nI play World of Warcraft and have raided the same two nights a week, every week, with my guild for years.  Discord is used for raiding.  My partner sent me a message about how I lied about being busy because they saw me playing WoW.\n\nIt was a little annoying.  Even if I wasn't a raider, I still regularly game with friends and my husband.  I shouldn't have to justify my plans to do stuff with other people online or even my plans to do something online alone, especially when I've already said I'd post tomorrow.\n\nBut I also understand that a lot of people have been burned by people who really did lie and ignore them so I let it slide. I explained that my plan was to play WoW with my guild and explained how raiding works.  I even told her the nights I raid so she wouldn't worry.\n\nThe next raid night came.  Imagine my surprise when I get a *nasty* message about ignoring our rp when she knows I was online playing a game.  I just can't with people sometimes.  Just kind of a funny story.",

            "selftext": "Oh boy, roleplayers, this is going to be a long one, I feel it in my bones. Here we go.\n\nSo there is this certain roleplay scenario that I like to play and often have great success finding partners with; however, as with every good partner, there are at least ten bad ones I need to sift through first. You know the ones: bad grammar, can't read the prompt, tries to change something, lazy writing, boring OC, etc. etc.. The ones I will talk about today are the ones that cannot for the life of them match their characters to the damn setting.\n\nLet me lay on you a summary of the prompt so you get the gist. Medieval setting, magical twins born with good and bad powers, bad twin runs away, comes back for good twin with lust for blood. Partner's character is along for the ride to either develop a love interest for one of the brothers, fighting with the good one, trying to have them make up, whatever it is. (basic good twin/bad twin trope with quite a bit of action, romance, maybe smut, death, all the works that I'd want in a *medieval setting. Gritty. Medieval. Setting.* Remember the setting, readers.\n\nI shall now present my top 3 hated partners (with fake names of course)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Kate. Kate was one of those that dropped the RP from the start. Why? I asked her if her description could better fit the scene, and she didn't take that kindly. This was her character description \"Katherine. 17, 5'6\" with a slim waist, C cup breasts, and a big butt. I have a toned body from running track. I'm wearing a white blouse with some ripped up jeans and riding boots\". This was not her IRL. This was legit her OC description.\n\nYou can see where I had some problems with this. Ain't no medieval woman measuring in cup sizes. Running track was not a sport back then and if it was I doubt women would do it. Jeans, blouse, riding boots. JEANS??? Kate was a no-go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Alaina. Alaina's character description matched fine, she wrote fine, but the scene she decided to throw in was every shade of random I can draw up for you. NSFW so uncover at your own risk. &gt;!Good brother and Alaina were doin' the ol' \\~devil's tango\\~ when all of a sudden GB feels two mouths. Opens his eyes to find that a fucking GHOST WOMAN is going down on him. Apparently Ghost has an unsatiable crush on GB, and keeps coming back for him even though he repeatedly drove her away through exorcisms (so now according to Alaina, my OC is a damn exorcist who's been fighting off a fangirl ghost) I didn't want to be rude, so I continued with the scene. Ghosty demands a threesome. I painfully play out the threesome scene. At the end, she cums ectoplasm all over the place, sighs,!&lt; and says she wants to marry GB and have a honeymoon in Florida.\n\nSo that was a doozy. Godamn ghost woman &gt;!comin' in for a threesome and !&lt;wants to marry and go somewhere that does not exist during this time period. I dropped Alaina immediately after that shitshow of a scene.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Rose. Rose was definitely not a character that would fit in my setting. Quick rundown first; sometimes we do not post our character descriptions until a little into the roleplay when our characters meet. It feels more immersive that way and shows a little suspense. After Rose, I decided that I would require descriptions form the beginning and that was that.\n\nHere's what happened with Rose. GB Is wandering through the forest, comes upon a lonely wounded girl (attacked by bad brother), and decided to help her. This is when I learn what Rose is. In the scene, she looks up at GB, removes her hood, revealing a pair of long white bunny ears. Oh for heaven's sake. The chick is a furry, guys. I got no problems against 'em, just this one, because a) character does not fit the scene. b) she was demanding. So, she's a \"sweet little white bunny\" with curly blonde hair and an outfit that would better match the Victorian era rather than medieval. Regrettably, I went with it and continued with her. OOC, she asked me if I could make a few of my other characters animals. Um??? The characters that I spent years developing over the course of different roleplays and you want me to turn them into furries? I ended up turning GB's guardian into a fucking terrier. I had turned one of my favorite characters\u2014a feisty, plump, old woman with a need to stuff children full of sugar and pinch their cheeks and yell at her husband\u2014into a fucking dog. I don't know why I tolerated that. Luckily, the roleplay didn't last because she wanted some smut, and while I love smut, I was not letting GB fuck a rabbit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd there you have it, folks. The three most memorable yet terrible partners I've had with that roleplay. Hope you enjoyed the tales of my suffering.",

There are bodybuilders out there in the world and I guarantee, if they were socked in the face, they would feel something and react.\n\nHere\u2019s the story, I\u2019ll make it short.

Something about TJ\u2019s character not wanting Cory to kill off the guards? So TJ\u2019s character pushes Cory to the wall when Cory starts yelling, and they argue for a minute, and finally Cory strikes TJ\u2019s character in the face because... y\u2019know, things got heated. Not sure why, but TJ\u2019s character showed no signs of being hurt. No flinch, no turn of the head, no nothing. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to say \u201coMg you absolutely NEED to feel pain,\u201d but come on.

            "selftext": "Did you ever meet the one dude who roleplays one kind of a character but then totally changes when it's about getting some from a girl character? Well I did and it was fucking ridiculous. To be precise my story is in the Star Wars setting; hence why the title, honestly. Pretty easy roleplay on discord and there's a cantina board where there was some kind of time-planned event; lots of people began roleplaying and texting in there with their characters and all.\n\nSome of them were pretty cool to meet. I was roleplaying a Jawa who was trying to sell some junk parts. Amongst these people, there were obviously the cringelords that tried to act like they had a greater scope of things (Force sensitives, Obi-Wan wannabes) and then there was this guy.\n\nThis guy was writing a human male. For curiosity I'd go and check everyone's profiles, this dude was roleplaying a 'war veteran', the kind with so many made-up name medals, scars and he was apparently divorced too. His personality as being 'cold' and mysterious, experienced and 'solid' (I still don't understand what the fuck that means lol). But hey, man, isn't that the kind of persona girls call daddy?\n\nCool character dude. Pretty unoriginal and really just meant to be the cool guy in the room, but sure.\n\nNow this would totally be fine if he actually roleplayed the way he 'advertised' his character to be. A random Twi'lek, the tavern owner, came up to him and asked if he'd take a drink 'or her'.\n\nHis response?\n\n\"He blushes\"\n\nI was literally about to have my Jawa stand up, A-pose and tell this simp to grow a pair. (I didn't because unlike him I at least try and stick to my character lol) Look. You literally advertise a character to be extroverted, cold, cool, experienced... and you make him react to that comment like he's some fucking fourteen year old seeing a girl with a larger chest size?\n\nI wasn't even roleplaying with these two, but redirecting all my responses to somebody else and yet can I just say that after reading this... I pretty much turned dead inside? I literally stopped writing and just kept reading what they'd go over to, until suddenly the Twi'lek announced the night was over (not even one fucking hour) and everyone left.\n\nAll cool until it was alluded both her and the Human guy stayed behind, inside, alone. Now, what or if they did something is beneath me, but yikes. I left this server fast as hell.",

            "selftext": "if you don't seem to give a fuck about theirs. This is a problem I have encountered a lot of times in group rps. Not every person like this only plays Marys Sues/Gary Stus, many also had interesting characters who are easy to write with. But the problem was always this:\n\nThey needed attention, attention, attention. Every new idea for the character, they would write about in the ooc chat. Which is not bad behavior in general. I like discussing characters with other writers ooc. But they would immediately get withdrawn or even angry if no one replied fast enough.\n\nWith group rps, the thing is that there are multiple characters. Not every writer is interested in getting to know your characters favourite ice-cream (or even tragic backstory). ESPECIALLY if you have never asked any questions about other people's character before, and have not even written anything with their characters yet.\n\nOnce, I met a girl, lets call her Rose. Rose seemed nice, and her character was good. But...:\n\n\\-she would always ignore most of the other writers when they talked about their characters. For example, if someone wrote in the ooc chat 'Hey, I made a new character, can someone have a look at them and tell me if everything fits the style of the rp?' even if she was on and writing in the chat, she would neither take a look at the new character nor  reply anything to this person.\n\nThis would also be fine, a lot of writers in this particular group rp did not comment on every single character. Some never wrote anything ooc at all But she would be 'sad' for days if not enough people replied to her characters new character trait.\n\n\\-it soon became obvious that she did not read other people's character profiles. At all. Like, you would write with her ooc about her character for hours, and then you would write something like 'Oh, if Naomi (her character) and Justin (my character) share this hobby, would you think that they would get along well?' and she would write back 'to be honest, I haven't read Justins character profile' and then go on and on about her characters favourite TV show...\n\nOnce, I directly asked her 'Which character profiles in the rp do you find the most interesting, who would you like to start writing with in the future?' (this was a question I asked multiple people, because I was interested in which character types were well-received). She replied 'Naomi (her character).' I thought she did not understand the question, so I added 'Oh, your character not included.'\n\nAnd she replied 'Eh, I did not read most of them. Anyway, about Naomi's secret ability...' She was in the rp for weeks at this time. And she had not read any of the other characters profiles??? There was not one character that she found interesting enough to at least read their profile? I was honestly taken  aback.\n\nSoon, people would become wary of engaging with Rose. It was always just 'My character this, my character that.' and basically ignoring people if they wanted to tell her anything about their own characters. Some people would still sometimes ask questions about her character, but less and less.\n\nShe noticed this, and complained to me about in a private chat. About how everyone 'ignores' her (not true) and all the other writers were only interested in other writer's characters (true...because you could actually talk about their AND your own characters with them). She did not even seem to notice how odd her behavior was, and had no idea why the others began to react like this.\n\nWhen I told her 'Maybe you should try to be more interested in other people's character, and they will be interested in Naomi'. she brushed me off, and later left the rp because she felt that her character was ignored.\n\nI just don't get people like this. You can't expect people to be interested in your character if you don't give a fuck about their characters.",

I'm always reading this sub and upvoting the stories here. I can relate to plenty of the complaints that are involved. I know sometimes we just need to vent and be acknowledged. I also hope it doesn't make anyone feel jaded about the RP community as a whole. Which brings me to this.\n\nI was wondering - more for the mod team here - if there's any chance we could get a weekly/monthly thread set up for some success stories? I have far more successful RPs and great writers that I collaborate with, than I do bad ones, and I think it would be nice to share that without taking away from what this sub is about.\n\nJust food for thought really, what does everyone else think about this?",

            "selftext": "*Insert obligatory mobile warning here*\n\nI made a throwaway for this because I know other people related to this rp are active on reddit\n\nI\u2019m on a discord rp server for a specific fandom. The server has around 20 users, of which maybe 12/13 people are active. It\u2019s honestly fine that some people aren\u2019t active - pretty much all the main characters are very active which is what\u2019s important. One of the people who isn\u2019t particularly active is the GM, Sam (fake name). Again, that\u2019s fine. They only have a couple of characters, all of which are minor, and they have real life obligations, I get it. \n\nFor this rp, Sam suggested that the characters would experience two canon events that happened in alternate timelines. After the first one, their memories of it would be reset and the second one would then happen (this is in line with the canon, so everyone was good with it). Sam went into very little detail on the reset so everyone took it as: deaths (except for a couple that we all agreed upon) would be permanent, and new relationships and character development would be kept. The only thing gone would be the memories of the first event. \n\nWe kept going with this in mind. Many people starting making plans for the second event, around five couples got together (the majority of which were canon but people wanted to build up to them), characters died and developed. Sam\u2019s characters aren\u2019t being used right now (a couple are dead because Sam wanted to kill them, one isn\u2019t plot relevant), but a few other people without relevant characters have made ocs, which Sam could\u2019ve done too but didn\u2019t. \n\nYesterday, Sam decided to tell us how they\u2019re planning to reset. All characters will be revived, all relationships that weren\u2019t existing from the start will be gone, and all character development is also gone. \n\nNeedless to say, none of us are really happy about it. It\u2019s a friendly server and most of us knew each other from other servers before the rp started so nobody wants to be rude and complain openly. However, quite a few people (including all the people playing leads, who are all very active on the server) said that they enjoyed the developments and relationships they had been working on and wanted to keep them. Also, in a previous discussion which Sam didn\u2019t contribute to, we all agreed that we only wanted/needed two of the ten(ish) dead characters to return, so most people aren\u2019t happy that everyone is coming back. Our revival idea had been mentioned by us multiple times after we had made it so even if Sam had missed the original conversation they had no excuse for not knowing what we wanted. Some people also said that this would completely ruin the plans they had made for their characters. Sam seemed to understand that we\u2019re upset but they said that that\u2019s how they thought it happened in canon (in canon it was never explained so they could easily change the plan to fit a different theory) and that they wanted one of their characters back (which I personally don\u2019t think is a great excuse considering that character wasn\u2019t plot relevant and Sam also chose to kill them off)\n\nWhen I first saw the plans I got mad but kept it to myself, assuming it was just me. Now that quite a few people have started complaining, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the server as a whole isn\u2019t happy about this. The reset hasn\u2019t happened yet, but apparently it will in a couple of days. I really don\u2019t want to leave the rp because I enjoy it a lot and I love the characters I have, I just feel like if we reset there was no point to the weeks we spent on the first event. \n\nI\u2019m honestly unsure if there\u2019s anything we can do. Sam must know that we\u2019re not in support of this plan but they\u2019re sticking by it, and I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable confronting them about it. I guess we\u2019ll just have to deal with it, but it\u2019s really unfair to the people who have put hours into these characters.",

            "selftext": "Small vent, but god, it still frustrates me.\n\nI started roleplaying with this one dude on Discord a little while ago. He seemed kind of cool at first, although his plot was outside of my tastes but I made an exception at the time. He showed me his lore, I thought it was neat, then we decided to make our characters. His character was a human and mine was an anthro tiger girl (which is the part outside of my tastes). \n\nI told him I can draw my own character and linked him to my art Twitter for reference of my art. He followed me and I had no problem with it at the time. \n\nI worked on my character and he waited not so patiently. He's the type to ping you if you don't respond to his greetings first thing in the morning, which I personally find annoying and off-putting but whatever, I can deal with it.\n\nNow, roleplay is my side hobby that I put on and off while art is something I want to prioritize. I'm not on my social media very often except when I post my art. At the time, I had a very important project I needed to work on so I blanked out Discord for a while so I could work. I know I should have said, \"yo, I'm gonna work on important stuff for a bit so don't expect me to be around\" but I wasn't expecting him to publicly tweet me on Twitter, message me on my art account on Reddit, follow me on Twitch, mention me twice on our roleplay server or join my Discord server all in service of getting my attention.\n\nI found it very inappropriate that he took advantage of knowing my social media just to poke me about a roleplay we hadn't even started yet. It was around the time that I found out about this that I'd also decided that I didn't like his idea anymore since the thought of an anthro tiger girl and a human guy slamming cheeks-even in fade to black-made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo I told him as much for all this and he ghosted me. Left my server, unfollowed me, deleted our roleplay, all that. I'm not even mad because looking back, he actually seems more like the type of partner I hate.\n\nIn summary, I don't trust furries anymore but drawing anthro tiger girls is kinda fun.",

Nothing wrong with that. Got some baits that were dry here and there. Soon a really promising response comes up. Almost marks every single box regarding what I like.

Only thing is they\u2019re from an asian-based country but we're staying in my country (good ol\u2019 USA) for the time being. No biggie, but this feels weird after what they did.\n\nMe and Pan talked for a little bit, agreed on almost everything. We got along nicely and switched to Discord from Reddit. We talked there a little and they asked me what kind of era our fantasy world is taking place. I responded with \u201cVictorian era\u201d and responded with some other technological things that could happen during that time.\n\n\u201cWhat are you a filthy Nig**r?\u201d Was the next message with an instant block from them.

            "selftext": "tw: emotional abuse, mentions of suicidal thoughts, super long story\n\nto preface this story, this took place on a site where interactions are open and visible to most people unless they happen in dms.\n\nthere\u2019s a system called \u2018multiverse/multiship\u2019 (multi for short) in my part of the site. \n\nit\u2019s character A and character B are together in one universe, and in another universe, character A and character C are together. they do not know of each other\u2019s involvement with A. unless plotted out by the writers that all three characters meet and become aware that C and B are romantically involved with A, the visible interactions are ignored by C and B. this allows for any number of relationships, dynamics, and universes to be explored between as many writers as you want. \n\nno one has issue with this at all, except for the person here. \n\ni met Unicorn (fake name!) about ten months ago, in an out-of-character chat for asian writers. my friend had had the idea to connect with other asian people for various reasons: solidarity, roleplaying in our native languages, building roleplays in our countries, etc. this meant roleplayers who are multiverse/multiship, and roleplayers who are singleship. singleship is just one relation\u2019ship, one universe. Unicorn was one of those people. She was a lot older, in her late thirties\u2014 which is important later. \n\nshe came to me later after we had all introduced ourselves in the chat and asked if i could help her set up an account with a character that was multi like mine. i had originally thought she was a bit rude, but i can never turn away people who ask me for help, so i agreed and helped her make a character and a page for all his information. looking back, he was a massive red flag: named Shisui (fake name!), a vampire and werewolf hybrid who was possessed by a demon, was Dominant, and very possessive. This type of character is one a lot of newer roleplayers on the site tend to want to be with, or to become. \n\nbut he was also charming and funny, and soon our characters started talking. talking grew into flirting, and eventually I told Unicorn that my character is multi, just in case she wanted to ship Shisui with them. she didn\u2019t understand at first, but after repeatedly explaining it she said \u2018i got it, but don\u2019t be surprised if Shisui gets jealous!\u2019 and all seemed to be well. my character already had two ongoing universes with separate writers, and she said he wouldn\u2019t mess with them, but I/my character absolutely had to tell Shisui if they ever fell in love with someone new or else he would feel jealous and anxious. \n\nso red flag, again: in my four years of roleplaying with this system, not _one_ person has asked me to do this besides Unicorn. I acquiesced because I respected her roleplaying style, and our characters got together. \n\nthey progressed... acceptably. got engaged about six months in to their relationship, which was probably a bad idea, but hindsight is 2020 or something. during this time, my character gained a few ships and dropped a few ships. the first two times, i forgot about her \u2018rule\u2019 to tell Shisui, and it exploded into an in character argument that ended up with me in real tears. it was probably rude of me to forget, and came off like my character didn\u2019t care about their relationship\u2019s agreements, but real tears\u2014 i dunno about that. \n\nduring all this time, ooc we talked occasionally and she bought me a couple presents for my birthday, and my character\u2019s birthday, which is about five days after mine\u2014 i never asked her for them, but i appreciated the gifts and thanked her profusely when they came. I also confessed a couple of my fears with my living situation and my future and my struggle with being suicidal, and she gave me advice that I happily took because I looked at her like... well she\u2019s much older, she knows what she\u2019s talking about. \n\nthen Shisui met another character called Neroi (fake name!) and they immediately hit it off. Neroi was one of my character\u2019s friends and they actually had a crush on Neroi, but Shisui and Neroi ended up together instead. \n\nShisui at the time also began to date others my character and I had had problems with in the past, as well as Unicorn defending a past in- and out of- character abuser. I cited this to her and said I was uncomfortable seeing them on my page, but she ignored it and told me to block them, which I had already. However, if your friends interact with them, they are still visible to you. There were a few arguments about this ic and ooc, but they were resolved... mostly. \n\nShisui began to spend more and more time with Neroi, essentially neglecting my character and all his other ships. IC and OOC friends were telling me they didn\u2019t like Shisui and how he treated my character, that he gave them bad vibes, but I didn\u2019t see any of it, unfortunately. \n\nAbout a month after they got together, Shisui and my character would fight a lot. Mine would say they were jealous that he spent so much time with Neroi, even talking to my character about them, which went against the typical rules of multiverse, multiship. Unicorn would always step in and say that I was being immature and a child, even though my character was only telling hers how they felt. It might have been rude, but it felt more rude to them to be denied affection and whatnot because Shisui was constantly talking about neroi. \n\nAt one point Shisui even admitted that they had outright neglected my character for a few days while playing games with Neroi. My character and Shisui went from happily engaged to barely knowing each other. \n\nThen BLM blew up all over the internet and since many writers in our circle are Black or other minorities, almost everyone was talking about it. a lot of racism was exposed, and many people began talking out of character about issues \u2014 mostly racism \u2014 that pervaded our roleplay community. i was one of those people because racial equality is important to me and I\u2019ve been made fun of before because I write predominantly asian characters and my English isn\u2019t as good as they said it could be. The whole site was signing petitions and talking about it. Unicorn never said a word, which she was entitled to silence because it\u2019s her account and she can do what she wants. \n\nBut then Shisui would get mad at my character for speaking up because it \u2018sounded rude and aggressive\u2019, and \u2018childish\u2019, even if most of my posts were out of character and I (admitting here it\u2019s probably childish) wasn\u2019t rude to people unless they were rude to me first, and even then it only amounted to me calling them clowns _twice,_ even with them hurling every manner of abuse at me. and then when my character said that, unicorn would come in and shut me down. Essentially, she told me I should speak up about these issues but \u2018do it kindly\u2019 even though I had been doing my best to present things concisely and succinctly. I know I can come off as sometimes very abrupt, and since she told me the first time I\u2019ve made efforts to take my time in explaining the details, define my tone, and whatnot. \n\nThe final conflict started with me asking someone to stop being racist to me and my character. I had blocked them already, and I thought I could vent a little, as my character, in Shisui\u2019s DMs. Shisui shut it down immediately and began talking about Neroi. my character got angry, and said that they wanted a break because they felt they had to beg for attention from him, and then. \n\nUnicorn stepped in. And did her whole spiel of calling me childish, and rude, and uncouth, and all these nice things that had absolutely nothing to do with her character and mine\u2019s problem. Before, I\u2019ve roleplayed huge fights between characters and not once has the actual admin taken offense to it\u2014 hell, we were inspired to deepen our characters\u2019 relationships and add all sorts of fun stuff to our plotline from that fight. But it was different with Unicorn, as always. She went on to say that she has \u2018ooc difficulties\u2019 and it makes her mad to come on roleplay and see people (heavily implied to be just me) talking about BLM when she comes on the site to get away from it. Which is valid, but there are mute options to hide those posts from view, and she\u2019s soapboxed about it time and time again. Then she went on to say people were talking to _her_ and saying _I_ was annoying whenever i talked about societal issues I saw on the site. \n\nI said I don\u2019t mind her having ooc difficulties, especially since I was too, and she could mute the keywords, she should tell those people to come to me. \n\nWe moved to a different private messenger where I attempted to get it back on track and focus on in character issues. I spoke in character about issues they and Shisui had, and she yanked it right back to ooc, referencing the problems I had mentioned earlier about my living situation and future. She gave me, essentially, a bulletpoint list of things I could have done to improve my quality of life, over half of which I had already done several months before. She ended it with saying that I \u2018spent all my time roleplaying or playing games instead of working\u2014 you could be doing so many useful things but you\u2019re wasting your time\u2019. School is out for the summer, and I work only two days a week thanks to COVID. what else can I do? \n\nI told her so, and said it was incredibly hurtful that she would bring that up and act as if I wasn\u2019t trying my best with what I can do. I also mentioned that I had made improvements, but hadn\u2019t said anything to her because I am primarily an in character speaker and don\u2019t often update other people about my life situation. I had expressed my fears because she offered to listen, and she gave good advice that I took. \n\nshe blazed right through, calling me childish again and again, invalidating that I had a reason to be upset over this person calling my character and I slurs, repeatedly telling me all I was doing in trying to explain myself was bad and I was \u2018just justifying my bad attitude\u2019. I was in the middle of a breakdown and these things just made it worse, and while I should\u2019ve stepped away I was manic and I do not make good decisions when I am manic. So I opted to stay and talk to her. My breakdown, mania, and a couple other mental illness related things were increasingly obvious in how I typed and what I said\u2014 I admit, and take full responsibility for them, because at a couple points I did say she had to stop talking to me like this because it was making my breakdown worse. \n\nShe said she didn\u2019t know what to say anymore, and I snapped back and said an apology would be nice for acting like I was so useless and assuming what happened in my ooc life. \n\nTo her credit, she apologized. I fell asleep before she did and couldn\u2019t respond right away, but when I woke up I saw the apology... and then, the time stamp told me it was eight minutes later that she went off again, saying she was done with me. \n\nAnd that threw me directly back into breakdown mode. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said, but at that point I wasn\u2019t thinking straight\u2014 think manic, dissociative, and breaking down all at once. I know I said a couple of times that I believed she hated me\u2014 which may or may not have been true, I don\u2019t know. \n\nShe blocked me on everything then, and I did the same. After crying to my friends about it for a couple of hours and being told that she had actually been ridiculously manipulative, I opted to forget about her and Shisui and move on. \n\nHappy end, right? \n\nGod, no. I wish. \n\nA day later I get a message from one of my writer friends saying she felt bad, and wanted to let me know that Unicorn had spread screenshots of our argument around, including the very personal fears that she made known in _great_ detail in her messages. She said it was clear I wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind in these messages and she wanted me to know that she felt it wasn\u2019t fair for Unicorn to do that. \n\nOn the verge of another breakdown, I told my friends about it and managed to calm myself sufficiently. My friend, with my permission, told other people who had been involved with Unicorn, and I got several messages saying she had told people to stop talking to my character because Shisui thought they were flirting, she had also sent screenshots to them, she and Shisui had emotionally abused and gaslighted them, and she would always bring HER out of character issues into every in character argument. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, she would purposely trigger people (a few of us struggle with ptsd or related things) and berate them while they were having a flashback or breakdown. Sound familiar? \n\nthat was about three weeks ago, and now there\u2019s a group of people who want me to make an expos\u00e9 on her on the site. \n\nbut really, I am tired and want to end this situation. Maybe if she does something more, but at this point she has too much clout because of the character she plays, and I want to rest. I put this here as a way to maybe get it off my chest because I\u2019m tired of crying about my personal shit being aired out to randoms by another random. If it happens, it\u2019s on my terms\u2014 like this. \n\nthanks for reading :,/!",

My closest freind on there who is also freinds with the person in Question said that she felt bad that they where basically ignoring my feelings on the matter and said that she\u2019ll help me find a solution. She wanted to try to \u201cBridge the gap\u201d between the two of us. She took some time talking to the other person and we basically found out why she has such a problem with me. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into detail cause Well privacy and well I wasn\u2019t told much anyway but, as I mentioned before in the last post I\u2019m a trans girl and well I guess the other person had a...not so plesant experience with somone like me and she associated that situation with me and well was basically taking it out on me. And I have to say I feel really bad now cause I had no idea...but at the same time its a little hurtful that she would associate me with the person who hurt her.\n\nSo long story short nobody got band and..we\u2019re trying to work things out its quite stressful but its not bad. Thank you all for the advice and support! I have another story involving a completely different group with a couple problematic people if anyone is interested, let me know if you would like to hear that story sometime soon.",

            "selftext": "So, this literally just happened. I am so confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I hook up with someone on Discord to discuss further details with, about the RP we wanna do. Person has rather broken English, but I am a patient person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, I am asking all the questions, try to figure out how and what they want. Eventually I get an answer. Now their character is an OC in a fandom, where I will be playing canon characters. Their OC is something that kind of fucks up the lore of this world, but I am like whatever. It isn't that big of a deal, I can roll with it. I'm easy-going. But to be honest, that should've just been a red flag already and I shouldn't even have bothered. But I am someone who likes to try and give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I start to bring up ideas on how to start this thing off. I ask if that works for them, or what they think. They say nothing to it, 10/10 communication right there, and then simply start to make a pretty bad suggestion for what my characters would do to begin this RP, in her opinion, which is completely out of character. I explain to them how I don't think that seems like something that fits the character, so maybe we can do something among the lines of 'insert suggestion.' \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey go, and I quote: \" I don't know as you says it will not work\"  \n\n\nAt this point, I am confused, which I tell them. I only said one suggestion they made, didn't seem like something I felt okay with doing? I wasn't immediately saying the whole thing was wrong? What is wrong with some healthy back and forth brainstorming throwing ideas around these days?  \n\n\nEvidently, a lot, or well, rather, at least to this specific person. \n\nThey say, and I quote again: \" We don't have the same wait or point of view and to be honest I'm here to have fun \n\nI go and tell them, that what they want is still possible, but not just from the get go. What they expected from my character, would need a logical reason for him to actually do this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not just going to twist a character and ruin their integrity and my own doing something that feels completely illogical because they 'demand' it just so their OC can feel all special. If they want these canon characters to act in this illogical way they should play them, not expect someone else to play them how they want?  That is just blatantly wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it was a demand. I am sure of it. I didn't say this, of course. But, after the fact, I am saying it now, because as soon as I tried to explain that I am just trying to brainstorm with them. Well... that didn't even go through anymore. I was already blocked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if  partly language barrier, or what, but that was still effin' weird! They didn't even seem to try to communicate at all. What a strange and rude person!",

            "selftext": "This is the story about a roleplay partner who I thought was good but turned out to be awful. It\u2019s also a story about how I stuck with a roleplay for far longer than I should have. I know that I made some mistakes here, and that there were a lot of things that I could have done better. However, I don\u2019t feel that excuses my partner\u2019s behaviour at all.\n\nToday\u2019s story is about a partner who I will call **Nachos**. I first met Nachos in a roleplay community; I\u2019ve discussed my experiences with that community [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/hasczp/a_community_run_on_victim_blaming_creep/). Nachos and I met as a part of a group roleplay which fell apart. However, the pair of us enjoyed roleplaying with each other, and really liked the chemistry between our characters. As such, when I left the community, I opted to stay in contact with Nachos. After a while, they approached me with the idea of rebooting our part of the group roleplay to focus on our characters, in essence continuing their story.\n\nNow I\u2019ll need to add a bit of background to give some context to the story. In this roleplay, my character was the leader of a millitary group. Nachos\u2019 character was their second in command. We decided that the story would focus on them and a few supporting background NPCs. The rest of their group\u2019s characters and assets would be divided between the pair of us to use as we saw appropriate.\n\nThe roleplay got off to a good enough start. It initially focused on character and relationship building as we worked with the chemistry between our characters as well as the supporting NPCs. And that was actually quite enjoyable, as it let me do a lot with this character that I\u2019d wanted to but never got around to in past. It was a lot of fun, and we got to do a lot of things that we had wanted to do in past, but really wouldn\u2019t have worked with the previous group RP format. So that was cool. \n\nHowever, this was still a millitary/action themed roleplay and, as much as I\u2019d been enjoying the character stuff, I was actually hankering for some action or combat scenes. After all, I was playing a millitary commander who so far had done very little of their actual job. I bought this up with Nachos. They admitted that there was some character stuff that he wanted to do, but then we\u2019d get to the action \u2018soon\u2019. Bear this in mind.\n\nInstead we got to what I can only describe as the eternal lake-house scene. It was a character/romantic scene that started off well, but then dragged on.  And on. And on. And kept going forever. It quickly became the longest part of the roleplay so far, longer than the rest of it put together.\n\nDuring all of this, Nachos kept trying to push ideas on me OOCly. You know, the sort of \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be cool/good for the roleplay/sexy/etc if we did this\u2019 sort of thing. And almost universally they were things I was not interested in, so I\u2019d say something to that effect. And then he would sulk about it. At one point he admitted that he wanted to \u2018push my roleplay boundaries\u2019. I shot back to say that I was happy with my boundaries being where they were, thank you very much.\n\nThis lead to our first big fight. Nachos put something in a post that I was neither happy nor comfortable with; furthermore, he did it without asking how I\u2019d feel about it first. I asked him to remove it, but he refused, saying that he didn\u2019t like to \u2018retcon\u2019 posts. I then put my foot down, saying that if he didn\u2019t remove it, then I was done with the roleplay; after all, it was clear that he wasn\u2019t going to respect my boundaries. Faced with this ultimatum, he almost immediately caved in and edited his post.\n\nFinally the eternal lake-house ended. We moved on to another scene which I had been hnging out for... only for Nachos to go \u2018I\u2019m bored with this scene and I can\u2019t make it work. Let\u2019s just end it now\u2019. Fine. I threw up my hands in frustration, but I let it go simply because we\u2019d agreed that an battle/action scene would be next. Finally, what I\u2019d been hanging out for since the start of the damn roleplay.\n\nOnly, what do you know, we couldn\u2019t even do that right. Nachos early on decided that he had a plan for the battle, one that he also didn\u2019t bother letting me in on. So we went through the early stages of it, with me working towards a big moment for my character. Only then Nachos announced that once again he was bored of the scene and was going to end it. Furthermore, he did such in a way that completely undercut my character as a leader or soldier, while also using some of the characters that we had agreed I would control. And, of course, he did all of this without asking me if I was okay with this first.\n\nAnd of course I wasn\u2019t. In fact, I was furious at him for doing this without even asking me first, while also pointing out just how little sense this all made. I also pointed out that I\u2019d had plans for this scene gain that he\u2019d cut off without even asking me about, while also rendering those plans completely invalid. I also pointed out that so far the roleplay had been entirely about what he wanted; every time I came up with an idea, it was put down as \u2018something to do later\u2019.\n\nNachos relented and deleted several posts so that we could complete the battle differently. I had my cool character moment, and felt really happy about it... for one post, as Nachos immediately said \u2018that doesn\u2019t fit my plan for the battle.\u2019 I pointed out that a) he\u2019d never bothered sharing this plan with me and b) he\u2019d never told me not to do that so in essence the fault was his.\n\nHe then decided to try and end the battle in a different way with a passable twist that amounted to \u2018well the hero team would likely lose if they continued.\u2019 My response was to have my character use the assets at their disposal in a logical manner in order to overcome this twist. That again threw Nachos as we were now so far off his plan that he admitted that he had no clue what to do next.   In short, his plan that he hadn\u2019t bothered to communicate amounted to making the battle unwinnable for my character.\n\nBut regardless, he said he\u2019d do something. And so I waited. And kept waiting. For two whole weeks. Bearing in mind that during the eternal lakehouse, Nachos had been pushing for multiple posts per day. I finally poke him, and he admitted tat he\u2019d been working on something else and that he probably should have contacted me. So I ended it there and then, realising that I was no longer having fun.\n\nI know I let this go on far longer then I should have. I admit now that I got too  attached to the character and the promise of things to come to see the problems beofre me until it was too late. But if nothing else, I\u2019ve since salvaged said character and reused them elsewhere, so there is that.",

For those of you who don\u2019t know a gamma ray is 27 million degrees. A human can survive at most 40 degrees Celsius or just over 110 degrees F. So I tell him everyone would die if they managed to get to that temperature. Whatever right? He makes a new OC and I move on.\n\nSubmission 2: same guy. He can generate temperature up to 262 degrees F. EXUSE ME WHAT?! So I tell him it\u2019s the same problem.\n\nSubmission 3: this time it\u2019s weakness to gamma radiation. Once again I say we can\u2019t do that without suicide bombing them. \n\n\n\nJesus Christ.",

            "selftext": "Once we played Warhammer 40k with an \"evil\" GM. We played as the Acolytes of the Inquisition. I was inexperienced, and always died without even waiting for the mission. It was hard for me and over time I stopped playing. But I will note right away, although he had some shortcomings, the GM had an extremely lively atmosphere (of despair) and well-written characters. He was very experienced and incredibly in love with the universe. The same couldn't be said for the players. And I want to tell you about one of them. In the game, he was an extremely stupid person and although the GM says that in life he have some smarts, he once accused and threatened me in the chat when I did something in the game. I said that this is just a game and I don\u2019t want to hear the negative and I don\u2019t want to discuss anything with him, to which I received in response, \"It's a pity that there is no way to discuss the garbage that you are saying face to face.\" In general, he was an amusing person. Returning to his behavior in the game: he chose characters with great power and an invincible hero backstory. Without forethought, of course. When it came to real action and acting out, he turned into an absolutely incompetent, stupid, stuttering coward. Because of him, the game process was always slow and boring for everyone (and he often metagame: \"This is stupid, GM\", \"I can do this move with blind eyes, why i need to roll?\" and so on). No one wanted to mess with him, because he always brought trouble for others. But! This is not what I want to tell you. I want to thank the player for the image he still left in my memories. I believe that in the game the player was not acting out, but playing himself, and this is what created very realistic moments from time to time. Like when demons got into the starship and in this lifeless darkness the acolytes discovered the holy sword, his character began to demand that he be given it. And when he was refused, he was ready to fight for this sword. At that moment I was sure that his mind had succumbed to the influence of demons, but no - it was his fear of death that drove him. Further, when the characters blew up the ship and were thrown into space, they terribly mutated and became the offspring of Chaos, with no chance of salvation. Disgusting, bloated carcass with demonic seals on the body, clawed hands and horns, which became This player's character, opened it beastial eyes, being on the wreckage of the ship. And even at that moment, he could not admit defeat. The player found the holy sword and despite the fact that it burned him, he continued to hug the relic. He touched the sword to the face until the moment when GM said that the character was unconscious. When he was killed by the same mutated player in order to save him from the suffering of existence by a monster, the player said \"Why? I could survive! The sword would have saved me from corruption!\" The bottom line is that for all his disgusting acting out and actions, I have good memories of realistic play of coward. Thank him for that.",

            "selftext": "If the title sounds confusing to you, well... it's even more confusing inside my head, so fingers crossed I get to present the case clearly enough. Also, too bad I can only give this one flair. I think it's more of a vent than seeking advice, although if you got the latter, you're more than welcome to give it.\n\nSo... I'll call her Angie, partially 'cause of the song by the Rolling Stones of the same name and well, she's a great writer and all but ain't it time to say goodbye at this point. We've known each other for *ages* and we've done a ton of stories together. Sadly, almost all (save for a single one) were never finished... or got anywhere, for that matter. Sooner or later, for one reason or another, Angie dropped them and started brainstorming something new with me. It got to the point where I began recognizing the signs of her interest waning each time and could predict the end in advance.\n\nShe was an extremely active and enthusiastic planner in the beginning, but over time that... changed. She wouldn't know *what* her characters would be like, even coming up with their names took her *days* at times. The brainstorming, usually so detailed and spearheaded by her (with me contributing, to the best of my ability that is), devolved to her inviting me to \"just start us off\". \"But I don't even know from where we ought to begin it,\" exclaims I. \"Oh, I'm sure you'll do brilliantly like you usually do.\"\n\nAngie is the type, who'd... praise *every* post of mine. She's actually the only RPer I know who does that, replying OOC with \"Very good\" and comments of such sort before getting on with her post. On one hand it's flattering, yeah, but... it starts feeling disingenous if a string of \"Very goods\" end with a story dropped now, doesn't it?\n\nOur most recent story, which hasn't seen any progress for some weeks now (so I can safely say it's dead by this point)... well, with it, I could see she wasn't into it straight from the get go. I wrote the starter, making sure to leave her plenty to respond/react to, but... it all got ignored. Picture this scene: my character drops uninvited on hers, knocking on the front door. I don't think it'd be godmodding to assume that said knock would be answered, so I included descriptions of what my character would say and do in the event of it happening. Her reply, instead, had her character having mundane thoughts, picking her attire for the day, mundane chores and it was only with the last sentence that the knock was 'acknowledged', while the door - opened. Nothing more than that. No reaction to my descriptions. In essence, if my starter and her reply switched places, the exchange would have made more sense, ironically enough.\n\nThis most recent RP was also marked by numerous typos on her end, which for *this* latest RP were uncharacteristically high for her - I generally know her to be impeccable about it. Even she commented on it, when I later did her a favor and transferrred all the posts on Discord and she got a chance to reread her past writings. Overall, it felt like they were... hastily written. For no other purpose than to get it 'out of the way', pass the ball back. Or maybe I'm just being needlessly dramatic here.\n\nAnd then even the replies stopped coming. Excuses in their place - what a busy day she had, how tired she was, or how many chores she had lined up for the rest of the day. If it should happen that I log into the chat after she does, however, then more often than not I'd see her with a 'Looking' status on. Although the reason behind that, she told me, was to just go 'fishing' for interest, no actual interest to RP on *that* day you see. And also, since we're relatively close time zones wise, she'd ask me if it isn't time for me to go to bed yet. Or general comments about why I'm up late. Those comments just didn't exist in the past, and instead of feeling flattered about concern in me getting enough sleep, it instead comes across as *wanting* me to log off and go to bed.\n\nNow you might be thinking that I'm pestering her for RP and/or trying to hog her attention? No, that's not it *at all*. This is where things get weird and to some extent frustrating to me. It doesn't matter who logs in first in the chat, or if she has a 'Looking' status or not. She *always* PMs me first, and within moments of me/her coming online. The trouble is, though, for the last few weeks it has been to just chat with me, so I've gotten to know what she's eating/cooking every day, her daily exercises, chores, what her pets did, what games she's playing and movies she's watching and so on, and so on. I mean, chat is okay with me but not if it's *all* there is. In the end, I want to, y'know... RP. Even more so, if I don't reply within a few minutes, I get poked.\n\nI've also tried talking to her about it - to have discussions about what went wrong in previous stories and failing that, reassuring her that it's 100% fine by me to have her seek other partners (a little hint that I'd rather not talk at all than just chat), regardless if I'm around or not. No dice. Angie just deflects the topic and starts talking about something else.\n\nSo I have *no* clue what's going on here, and whether there's anything I can do about it. I mean... I *do* have *theories* why it's happening, but... yeah, they're just theories. I'll lay them out anyway, to get them off my chest, and you tell me (if you're still reading, this is getting to be pretty damn long as it is) if I'm overthinking it.\n\nOne, Angie has some *very* left-field kinks. They're mandatory for her to even entertain the idea of RP and I'm fine with them, but it looks like nobody else is, at least on the platform we're using. She just doesn't want to RP with *me* or maybe doesn't like my characters enough (who, by the way, I'm unwilling to change), but... since there's hardly anybody else around to cater to her interests for the time being, I'm a bridge she's unwilling to burn just yet. So I'm \"kept\" as a way to pass the time - through chat.\n\nTwo, Angie is actually very much fed up with me and done doing anything with me, no matter what. However, she's just too 'nice' and non-confrontational... so maybe the idea is to get on my nerves, and to have me tell her what I've typed in here just now. *Then* it'd be time to act surprised/shocked and reassure me that's not it at all... *buuuuut* since I think that way, best to part ways. In other words - say the goodbyes, but with her on the 'moral high ground' and with a clear conscience, because in the end it was *me* who 'exploded for no reason'.\n\nIt's one of those cases, where I wish I was just ghosted instead, heh. Anyway, if you made this far then thank you for your time and if you got advice, *no matter what it is* \\- even if you think I'm making a mountain out of a molehill here, or *I* am the bad RPer here (not that she is, either, but... tiny bad, maybe?), you're very much welcome to give me it.",

But you also don't want the people who are home all the time to swallow up other people's posts, so you implement a post order.\n\nThat's fair, right?\n\nOkay, well I work from home, so I can post a *lot*. I type fast, and when I'm inspired by a story, I type a lot, fast. I average at about 20 minutes per 5-9 paragraphs. I don't expect others to match me.\n\nBut now I'm in this place where I joined a server that didn't have a post order when I came in, but other players asked for one after they joined a scene I started. So now I have to wait...and wait...and wait... I can't just post, even if my post is to pull my character out of that scene and plop her into something where I know the other players will be faster. I still have to wait until it's my turn.\n\nThat wouldn't be an issue, except the people I'm waiting on average at 1 post per day, which means I now have to wait 2 days between being able to write, by the time it's my turn again - I'm not interested in this scene anymore.\n\nIt's no shade to leisure paced writers. Everyone's got their thing, but this is one of the numerous reasons why I only play in group stories - because there's always something going on. For a newer story like the one I'm in, there's not a lot else happening. I'm....bored. I'm like so very fucking bored right now.\n\nThe server owner is new and open to suggestions, but I feel like I'm being annoying because a lot of the things I would suggest are geared toward more volume, more activity, while the newest players are more leisure paced. I guess I'd just want to ask that when joining scenes with me, we can all agree that there's no post order and to just write when your character has something to say, rather than spending days between posts. For me personally, it's harder to get in character when I only turn it on for one post and then wait for days. I know 2 days doesn't seem like much, but now there's a bunch of other people in the scene, so it's becoming more than just that...\n\nI'm just really frustrated.",

            "selftext": "Hi. I hooked up on Reddit not too long ago (literally today) because I began actually skimming through sub-reddits and had a good time. I found this one while searching for roleplay stuff and it looks amusing being able to share stories. I'll share a pretty recent one. It spans within the last 7 days I believe.\n\nSo. I am in a discord server for roleplay and just having a good time with the boys. One of these we will call Alo which is not the real name of course but just a nickname. Now, this is kind of a big server and we are all organized with docs and stuff. I am not staff there but some kind of assistant, low-grade kind of... moderator?\n\nNo real moderator stuff but just some kind of guy who answers questions to new members.\n\nAlo is your regular dude who likes anime, cool powers and etc etc. Nothing really weird about him. Then, we have this girl that we will call Bali. (Not the real name, of course). Now this Bali is also your average girl and is pretty friendly with everyone, but something's off. I didn't really notice this trend but shortly after she joined, she began hopping up in voice chat (we don't have IC voice chats, they're all OOC and meant for chill and stuff) which alone wouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut of course, there was a problem. She'd keep drinking every night in voice chat while she stayed on and talked with everyone else.\n\nNow that alone is maybe something not too uncommon. A lot of gamers also drink and chill in voice chat with the boys. But of course there had to be some form of 'drama'.\n\nBasically this dude Alo has been permabanned for sexually harassing Bali. To which I call bullshit. Why? As I told you this Bali has been doing this 'voice chat late drinking' all the nights, but I really didn't catch onto this after a few days this was going on.\n\nSo I can only attest for those few voice chats I attended but basically I can confirm there's more than meets-the-eye here. I have heard Bali in normal circumstances and nothing's off about her, but when she's drunk she's literally intoxicated. So needless to say I literally caught her giggling or making weird noises whenever Alo was talking, so it's easy to assume Alo got... 'stimulated'? I am not sure what kind of approach he made, but it's obvious to say that it wasn't an one-way approach.\n\nYou'd assume maybe he pulled out something and sent a mean picture, but no. None of this comes from DMs. He got banned because of voice chat attitude, why? Because she continued on with this and eventually Alo began making assumptions about them being together with silly pick up lines or their character would get together and have sex and stuff. She was drunk and just laughed it off all the time.\n\nWell she definitely had a heavy sober up because the next day she reported him for being a weirdo to her and he got banned for sexual harassment. To which I said, I call bullshit as I fought the staff heavily on this, to the point I got fired from my assistant position because I presumed it was her fault as well. The staff blamed him nevertheless because they say Alo should have just ignored her and I got fired because they thought I was being 'bias' because they assumed Alo's my friend.\n\nHah. Yeah. We talked like twice in a bunch of months. Nice assumption.\n\nNo one gives a shit she was drunk and playing along. To which, okay, I am not sure if Alo also began drinking and of course he should have thought about it twice before he'd go and tease her but for Christ's sake, you literally have drunk people in voice chat without any rules against it or regulations it's literally a recipe for disaster!\n\nThis is not very much so related to actual roleplay, but it's a story in a roleplay discord server nevertheless. The only bit of roleplay implied would have been their two characters having sex to which I have no idea if they wrote anything like that in DMs and I don't care. I still believe if he got punished, she should have been as well. Oh, I almost forgot to say one thing.\n\nI was a lower staff position and barely talked with staff members. I wasn't there to force myself and be anyone's friend but to roleplay rather while I'd always see Bali be tight with the server's owner. At this point I don't even care anymore that I'm just a member now. I'll honestly just wait until this happens again and the staff begin to open their eyes or somebody else gives them trash for their favoritism or lack of vision.",
