            "selftext": "Hi all, I just need some advice, or to see if I\u2019m in the wrong here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nive been friends and rp partners with this person for years, and I\u2019ve never said anything because I used to not mind at all, but we went on a two year hiatus and now I do care due to my style and outlook changing.   \n\n\nwe started a Pok\u00e9mon RP up, and I\u2019m playing the player character (basically the character you actually play as in game, you have the choice of boy or girl), Tia, and they are playing a villain Who\u2019s arc in our rp is becoming good. My character has no real canon personality due to her being the player character, whereas their character was basically written for them by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon, they are playing this villain IC so they haven\u2019t changed his personality a lot besides the obvious story arc we\u2019ve written together. This is all fine by me obviously, nothing wrong with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy problem is, with each Pok\u00e9mon game the one final goal you have is to become champion, and so that is what I decided was going to be the story arc for my character since I had nothing else to work off of due to the player character having no dialogue or anything. All we know is that she must be a good person due to defeating the villain and becoming champion. made a personality for her that matches this goal, and I personally feel she has been well written and I stuck to that main goal.   \n\n\nthis is the ENTIRE plot of the rp thus far. Well, my partner decided to create another character, I\u2019m always fine with character additions I think it spices things up! so they created a kid named Angela and I asked my partner what they wanted for her story arc, and they didn\u2019t have A response. Later on, my main character Tia was interacting with Angela and my partner says wouldn\u2019t it be funny if Angela beat Tia And became champion. im still a bit of a pushover, but I really thought they were joking Because this entire RP has been about this one goal. this was weeks ago. they Brought it up again, I also couldn\u2019t tell if they were joking So I didn\u2019t dispute it. Now, cut to today, Tia finally became champion after like 5 months of this RP, and they tell me Angela is going to become champion in 3 in game years. I had planned for Tia to be champion for A pretty long time given that it\u2019s her entire arc and champions are usually older..i wanted her to be a very powerful trainer and this would show in how long she holds the title. Anyways, I am a pushover and I acted Like I was fine with it but I\u2019m actually pretty upset that my partner didn\u2019t even ask if this was okay. I personally think that main characters should have priority over side characters that aren\u2019t played or used very often and now I have to think of an entire new career for Tia that matches her own goals. It sounds like my partner already thought this all out for Angela so I\u2019d feel horrible asking Them to change it especially since I\u2019ve expressed that I was fine with it Multiple times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for the long read, but what do I do??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni should also mention that my partners main character has Gotten a lot more \u201cscreen Time\u201d than my character and it seems like my character can\u2019t do anything right (ex. Tia\u2019s hits always miss, but partners character always one hit KO) So I was extremely excited for my character to finally achieve her goal. So I personally feel that my partner is a bit more on the controlling side as they\u2019ve always been for our rp\u2019s, but I think that\u2019s because my personality isn\u2019t quite as creative and I try to be okay with most things, so it doesn\u2019t really bother me too much or for too long as long as we stick to the story, this is just a much larger problem than usual.",

            "selftext": "I have soooo many stories about this former RPer it isn\u2019t even funny. But this is from a PJO RP that I\u2019ve been running for over a year now so I thought I\u2019d share this one since it happened in the RP I personally GM.\n\nSo for context the way that me and some of my RP friends run their RPs. We call them counters, you have 7 days to post in the RP if you hit day 8 you end up getting removed from the RP. But as long as you communicate with me then I\u2019m fine giving you an extra day or two to post. This is just used to keep things moving, and weeds out the people who end up flaking. Once you post your counter gets reset. \n\nI run the RP with updates once everyone has posted for that round then I update. If my update is really late then if someone\u2019s counter is high as well then they get an extension as well.\n\nI follow the same exact rules as well, if I hit day 8 then the RP dies. Luckily however it has never come down the this. I usually write the updates when I personal counter hits Day 6 just to keep things moving and so that way no ones counted is high. I also use discord for my RPs, and check everyone\u2019s counters at least daily and usually make announcements there.\n\nThis player hated that so much that I updated a lot quicker than she posts. I work fast food as well, this happened on a weekend that was fast approaching. Weekends for me are the hardest throughout the week as well and I\u2019m usually really tired and don\u2019t want to deal with drama and she knew this as well. This person also usually rode them to the last possible moment to.\n\nSo I\u2019ll just be calling her LDA (Lady Dumbass) from now on. This isn\u2019t exactly word for word but what I can remember.\n\nLDA: Hey, we need to talk.\n\nMe: Hey, I just got off of work, can it wait until tomorrow?\n\nLDA: No we need to talk about this right now.\n\nMe: *Groaning* Alright what do you want to talk about?\n\nLDA: I need you to stop posting so quickly, you are giving me less time to post.\n\nMe: I am just following my own counter, I\u2019m on day 6, and I need to update to keep things moving. Your counter isn\u2019t that high right now.\n\nLDA: Well I need you to stop, it\u2019s affecting my schedule.\n\nMe: It isn\u2019t really, and I work this weekend and I won\u2019t have time to write at all. As well as being really tired. And everyone else\u2019s counters are getting high, I need to update to keep things moving. It isn\u2019t fair that I have to wait till the last minute week in and week out and it\u2019s not right for the others to wait as well.\n\nShe kept making that stupid argument the entire time we had this conversation until she left but not before leaving this message in both my discord server and the OOC itself. I edited slightly just to respect the two RPers who are still in now but still gets her message across anyway.\n\nLDA: I'm sorry , but I can't remain here with this sort of clique opinion going on. It's not fair to me or the rest of the group. Nallore, I asked only for you to be a fair GM and to help me. I didn't mean right now, but I did mean for you to take it into consideration. If you cannot step up and handle your duties as a GM. Then I'm sorry but I can no longer be in this Rp. I wasn't complaining about your time schedual other than the fact it limited me. I don't have a problem with that, just the limited reply I can give you and I honestly hate writing like  that. So I'm sorry, but this group is just too hostile for me.\n\nI was never hostile to her or any of the other players either who did stick up for me. And I did give her extensions as well to whenever she asked for them as well. \n\nAnyway that is my story lol.",

            "selftext": "This happened a while back and both of these stories are no longer around anymore.   \n\n\nThe first one ran for a really long time. It actually started on AOL, where I was in the SL with a Dornish character, but then I went on a hiatus and AOL went \"gold\" so everyone jumped ship to Discord. The owners were basically this mxf pairing who each had a few dozen or so characters. I, personally, only like to play one main character per story, but I'll pick up a few side characters to help a story move along.   \n\n\nSo I rejoined this story on Discord. They weren't the most helpful, but I was new to Discord and fresh off a hiatus, so i didn't immediately notice they were actually being rude or unwelcoming *to me*, I just assumed it was the language barrier and I wasn't reading the context correctly.   \n\n\nI made another Dornish character and hopped right into play. Immediately, I noticed no one was really trying to talk to me or my character. If I said something in the OOC chats, they would all just get really quiet or talk over me as if I'd not said anything. In play, the characters would look at me, think something really mean, and then continue ignoring my character.   \n\n\nOkie dokie. I wasn't deterred. I figured they all knew each other, so if I wanted to play, I should just bring in a friend. I did that. I brought in a buddy of mine, who we'll call Zen. Zen and I had been wanting to do a historical fantasy story together for a while, so this seemed like the perfect time. It was more or less understood that though we had applied separately and our characters hadn't met yet, we would eventually be pairing our characters.   \n\n\nHis character shows up in a scene I started. Our characters start talking, start flirting a little. Then, without asking or anything, 3 other characters show up in the scene, including one of the female owner's 24 (I shit you not) characters. Immediately, these three move between our two characters and start ushering his away while thinking a bunch of nasty stuff about Dornish girls stealing all the Northmen away.   \n\n\nZen told me in DMs that he didn't appreciate them butting in and that the female owner was in his DMs saying that she was making a character that would be a \"much better pairing for his.\" He was there to write with me though. We gave it one more chance, but again, they shoved themselves in the middle of our scene. By then, he was just over trying to make it work, so he bowed out. In OOC, they were all really confused, and then the lady owner started acting super heart broken saying that she was making a character for him, that he'd agreed to her making, and he'd left her high and dry. I bowed out too. Probably my only other friend in there immediately messaged me asking if I was okay and then he screen shot the chat after I left to me, with both of the owners saying \"good riddance\" and bragging about banning me.   \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nI found another GoT story soon after. A little wiser, I went in and asked how they are with new players to see if I was setting myself up to join another clique. They assured me that I'd always have someone to write with. I brought my Gargalen in, and at first I was the only Dornish character. This server was owned by 3 people. A guy we'll call J1, a woman we'll call L, and another woman who we'll call J2.   \n\n\nJ1 and J2 each made Dornish characters. One was a Dayne, I think, and the other was \"King\" Martell, because in this 'verse that's what they were doing. The Dayne and my Gargalen got along right away. The Martell and my Gargalen less so, but he was fair enough. Then a new girlie came in and she applied an Yronwood, who was my character's cousin. We all got along fairly well. My Gargalen was looking like she was going to be paired off with the Dayne, but then I found out that her cousin, Gwyn of Yronwood, had already slept with him to ensure an alliance. I wasn't mad at all though. That's just how the game goes, and I was still having a lot of fun.   \n\n\nThen my character answered an invitation to King's Landing to meet with the current Targaryen King. He was actually played by the singular friend I had in that other server, so I was amped to write with him without someone butting in. Well... that didn't turn out so great. His character decided he was obsessed with mine and he tried to force himself on her, because Dornish women are \"loose like that.\" We faded to black and ended it with him getting some of her clothes off but not much else happening. She went home, a little broken, but otherwise okay. Her ship had to restock at Shadow City, so she went to Sunspear to clear her head. King Martell, played by J2, showed up.   \n\n\nHe said he knew that she had answered the summons from the Targaryen and he was disappointed. She pulled out her dagger, threw it at his feet, and told him to kill her for her betrayal or basically get out of her face. What happened next was a long ass scene of them spending the day together that ended in a proposal which would keep House Gargalen safe from House Vaith while also securing Gargalen ships for the Martell because House Yronwood and House Dayne were planning to secede from greater Dorne.   \n\n\nHonestly, I loved it. Their story was adorable. I loved writing them getting closer. The issue was that J2 didn't actually have a muse for male characters. She would go days and sometimes weeks between playing her Martell, while I could see her on alt accounts with her northern ladies getting wifed up with knights and lords. It wasn't a great feeling, and since we could only be in one scene per character at a time, I was left basically stuck in non-moving scenes for long periods of time.   \n\n\n  Finally, I just made another character. This one was a Manderly. Around this time, the girl playing Gwyn Yronwood left the server, so the Dayne didn't really have anyone to write with. I messaged J1 and asked if there was a reason for a Dayne to visit House Manderly. We started writing. Admittedly, they didn't have much chemistry, but I wanted to write so bad - I was so bored - that I admittedly pushed them together more than I should have.   \n\n\nAnyway, after a few days of that, I really just wanted to play my damn Dorne girl again but she was stuck in a scene. There was no rule about not double-posting, so I just posted that my character left the scene and ended it. Within a day, I got a message from L saying that I was basically in trouble for ending the scene early, that J2 was sick and she felt bad because I bailed on our scene and it wasn't okay to rush others. I didn't mean to \"rush\" her. But by then it had been 3 weeks of watching her actively writing her other 2 female characters elsewhere while mine just sat suspended in time. I apologized to her anyway, and she seemed like that was fine.   \n\n\nTwo days later, I was at work, so I couldn't really look at my phone until the very end of an exhausting 14 hour shift in a job I friggin' hated. I got to my car and saw I had a few messages. J1 and J2 had both messaged me to say they had decided to drop their Martell and Dayne characters because they just weren't feeling it.   \n\n\nThat wouldn't have been too bad. I mean, I was upset about the Martell because I was really enjoying that game, but the Dayne and my Manderly really didn't have chemistry, so I didn't care much about that. What upset me was that when I looked in the server, they had both reused the accounts for those characters to make a Princess Martell for J2 and an Yronwood Lord for J1, where they had apparently been in love but forbidden from one another their whole lives. They were already through 2 scenes when I got off of work, and their first messages to me saying they had dropped the characters came in maybe 3 hours before that.   \n\n\nI honestly felt shattered. They wrote the King Martell out as having abdicated so his sister, J2's new character, was now in line to be Queen as soon as she married J1's character who was no longer forbidden from her now that his sister, Gwyn, was dead.   \n\n\nAfter the day I'd had, I just broke down and cried in my car. When I finally got a hold of myself, I thanked everyone for their time, pulled my characters, and left. Immediately, L started messaging me saying I was this massively toxic asshole, that I was immature, that I was \"only leaving to make them feel bad.\" I'd argue they SHOULD feel bad. What they did was back-handed and fucked up. Eventually though, L bullied me into joining again.   \n\n\nI didn't take the Manderly back up because I just didn't have a muse for her. Instead, I just focused on my Gargalen. The only two other Dornish characters were pretty much exclusively playing together, but they kept summoning my character to their wedding in a way that kind of rubbed it all in my face. My character was heart broken. Her \"fiance\" and her had talked about leaving everything behind and sailing into the horizon together, but he ended up doing that on his own and leaving her there. I just wanted some time to figure out what I wanted to do with my character, but then they instituted an activity rule of playing weekly or being removed.   \n\n\nOkay. I started doing solo scenes. I just had my character working through her emotions, handling her House's affairs, spending hours looking out at the sea and just thinking about stuff. It was activity and it made sense for my character. So then they instituted another new rule, this one saying that we could only do one solo scene per month.   \n\n\nI got Zen to come join me around this time. He made a character in another kingdom because he prefers more of a viking aesthetic. Our characters somehow got to interacting. It wasn't a great love story, but at least I knew I could count on him. When he finally proposed, the admins stepped in and said that because our characters were from different kingdoms, they needed to get their King or Queen's blessing to be married and not to bother even asking because both sets of Monarchs were going to say no. Zen pressed and asked if they could just elope or something, or if his character could give his House to a sibling to go be with mine. They said that if he tried, they would have him executed.   \n\n\nGreat.   \n\n\nSo he left and I was back to square one. By that point, every time I made a friend in that server. They would get booted for unrelated reasons. It started being just another clique. It was clear to me that they just wanted to all play the Kings and Queens with the rest of us being little fan-girling pawns to do their bidding, but we weren't allowed to have our own stories. I didn't want to make a scene though, so I did one final solo scene of my Gargalen passing off her title to her sister, getting on a ship, and sailing into the dawn. I said in the OOC chats that I loved my time spent there but that work was too hectic right now, so I would be leaving but I wished them all the best.   \n\n\nL messaged me as soon as I left with \"Pro tip: don't bother coming back.\"   \n\n\nI wasn't going to. That was 3 years ago, and I haven't even glanced at a GoT server since.",

Not the rules, not the starter, not anything but the title, it seems.\n\nI barely ever play ERP, but when I do I expect the other person to know anything about sex.

I get messaged constantly but people that don\u2019t know what it means but one particular person was really harsh and pushy.\n\nSo we started off the roleplay normally, it was going great. Sure he wasn\u2019t the most detailed roleplayer but it didn\u2019t bother me. I am very detailed in my writing with mostly long responses. This guy never had one liners but the responses were short. Our characters just meet IN A COFFEE SHOP, and his character starts sliding his hand up her skirt! First off way to fast into any relationship and second he messaged me from a post that says SFW. \n\nI confront him saying I said SFW and he just says, and I quote, \u201cBitch you\u2019re ruining the mood, just go along with it.\u201d I was annoyed by this and outright told him no! He goes on a rant about it not being a big deal and how I should just do whatever he wants because I\u2019m a girl so it\u2019s my job to satisfy men. I sent this, \u201cWomen aren\u2019t some toy for you to use for pleasure. We\u2019re humans too.\u201d His response was, \u201cWhatever, you\u2019re just an ugly cunt. I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d And my response was blocking him on everything he had me on. \n\nI\u2019m tired of being treated so poorly because I want SFW roleplays. \ud83d\ude13",

            "selftext": "This person was someone who was giving me red flags from the beginning, but I decided I'd give them a chance. \n\nSo I made a post on tumblr asking for people to hmu on discord for a roleplay. Say what you will about tumblr, but it's the website I've used with the biggest rp community, and though you have to weed through some shit, I've found some good partners there. My ad was asking for a supernatural x human roleplay, I wanted some drama and romance and preferably fxf, but I said I'd be good with mxm or mxf too.  \n\nThis person, I'll call them T, sent me a friend request. Cool, we started talking, and they sent me a Google doc with their rp info. It was basically a short introduction and a list of their OCs. The characters seemed cool, and they said they were 24, so I assumed they'd be mature. Ha, turns out age isn't everything. \n\nI started off by asking the basics- what kind of pairing do you want? \n\nWell, instead of answering my question, they said they usually like to \"throw our characters against each other and see what sticks\". That confused me, so of course, I asked, \"so you want to do a roleplay where we each have multiple characters?\"\n\n\"Great idea!\" Deadass. That's what they said. As if I was the one suggesting it. \n\nWell, may as well try it out, I thought. It wasn't the roleplay I was asking for, but it was something. \n\nThen when I asked about setting, T decided that they wanted to play in this tabletop game world that I knew nothing about. When I asked for setting I meant location, but they gave me a whole universe which was basically just an urban fantasy, so alright, whatever, let's do it. We said that we would start with my character doing a paranormal investigation, and then their girl would come out and bump into her. A nice, basic start. \n\nSo I sent my starter, my girl was walking in a park at night with her camera and flashlight, trying to find ghosts because this area was supposedly haunted. A simple start with character descriptions, you know how it goes. \n\nNow, without asking me, and going against our plans, T starts off roleplaying a group of men. They come out, surround my girl, and start taunting her. I was surprised and confused, but I went with it, and then they made the men start... grabbing her. Touching her. Sniffing her hair. This was not what I signed up for at all. \n\nIn OOC, they asked if my girl should get away or not. Well, I was sleeping when they asked, so they continued on their own. T said they rolled a die and decided that my girl was going to get roughed up. I woke up to a message asking me if broken bones were okay. \n\nI said no, absolutely not, and my message contained a \"yikes\". I said I wasn't comfortable with this, and they agreed to just make their character actually come now... though reluctantly, because they said that this tabletop game had a very harsh world and humans weren't treated well. Seeing as they knew I knew nothing about this setting, that isn't a valid excuse for an attempted gangbang without asking. \n\nWell, they sent their message with their character coming, and I didn't respond right away; I wasn't in the mood. Only a few hours later, they were pinging me to reply. Honestly that was my last straw. At least give me a day or two before pinging me, a couple hours is just. Ridiculous. Especially after telling them that I was off and on during the day. The moment you don't allow me to have a life is the moment I drop you. \n\nNow, I'll have you know that I'm not a fan of ghosting when it comes to long term rps where you have something built up and plans for the future. When it's at that point, talk to them about stopping. But when it's like this, it just started, and already I'm uncomfortable and the person keeps pushing boundaries, that's when I ghost. From my experience, these people never take rejection well, they always try to guilt you or try and make changes and push and push when all you want to do is stop. \n\nSo, my plan was to ghost them. Just stop responding, and they'll get the message. Well, they're not getting the message. They're still messaging me, pinging me, asking if everything's okay- like, I don't know you, you don't know me, I don't owe you an answer and I've already told you you make me uncomfortable. How much more of a hint do you need? You tried to gang r*pe my character, of course I'm gonna ghost. \n\nAnyways, there's my most recent bad rp story. I'm about ready to just block them, though I didn't want to have to go that far.",

On dear was it bad. I think I was 14 or 15 when I first discovered erps. You know how the sensible people have age limits on those rps? Guess who blatantly ignored all of them?\n\nYeah... I was pretty trash for doing somewhat illegal things because I was too horny to look up PH on incognito mode. Ah geez. I saw a post about how spotting those underage were really to do so when starting an erp and it just brought back flooding memories of my trashy rp past. By the time I discovered these rps I was a good storywriter and could handle a multiple paragraphed rp so I just remember laughing to myself while doing these sometime like \"Haha they're never gonna know\".\n\nWell here I am fucking outing myself! I don't do that bs anymore and thank goodness for that. If you're underage, do NOT participate in these rps. I don't care how close you are to your 18th birthday. If you try to go to a club a week before you turn 18, the bouncer won't even let you in. Just be fucking sensible, cause it's illegal to some extent.",
