There are very few times where I have to actually pause the rp to address something. My biggest pet peeve though is character controlling. Like I understand if you place a dizzying spell on me but don\u2019t put in there \u201cyou feel it\u2019s effects and drop to your knees before passing out.\u201d Your response should NOT have the word \u201cyou\u201d in it unless it\u2019s dialogue. I cannot express how angry it makes me when people do that because 100% of the time they\u2019re making my character react in a way that contradicts my character\u2019s personality. Like if they say something they think will shock my character so they make them have a surprised reaction. I rp with someone who does it a lot and I\u2019ve tried asking them not to and they always say ok but do it again. At this point I\u2019m ready to drop the whole thing after they literally made my character reply to them so basically our characters had a whole conversation without an ounce of my input. If you\u2019re someone who controls other people\u2019s characters PLEASE stop it!",

I mean, I got my start on Neopets forums where you just posted your character's dumb little bio into a group (or someone's inbox for 1x1) and jumped right into things, so maybe that's my problem? \n\nI don't mind a little back and forth to get some basics established, but I also want to leave room for some surprises and so things can be established organically. I've recently found a few people who've been open to a very minimal starter and it's helped my creativity and interest a lot. \n\nAnyone else have this experience?",

Is there any way to try not get too attached? I don\u2019t want that to happen or get paranoid every passing minute when my roleplay partner types, wondering if they\u2019re typing that they\u2019re going to end it or not.\n\nThanks!",

My other friend and I are locked in a massive roleplay which I DM with about a hundred characters, a ton of worldbuilding and many plot lines.

            "selftext": "This happened almost a decade ago, but I remember it well.\n\nI had a Dark Elf character living in the capital of his Dark Elf-centric country. Bear in mind, in this world, Dark Elves basically viewed themselves as superior to every other race, even other elves, and at best only tolerated other races living in Dark Elf cities (mostly demons, fallen angels, and whatnot). I had spent some time establishing my character in his home and decided to have him run an errand in the marketplace, which I figured would provide a good opportunity to meet another RPer.\n\nEnter a character whom I'll refer to as Doll, as that's pretty much what she looked like. She was a human, not a Dark Elf, demon, or fallen angel, so her presence in this city was already questionable. Still, I thought it would fine if there was a decent story to explain why she was there.\n\nI never got such an explanation, but that's a small complaint compared to what she did while she was there. In the middle of the marketplace, Doll roleplayed a fight between her and some NPCs which she effortlessly took out using ice magic, causing some damage to nearby structures while she was at it. It was a saving grace that she didn't describe what race the NPCs were, because, another fact about Dark Elves in this setting, they will absolutely brook no injury toward their own kind, and any individual of any other race that does so is essentially marked for death.\n\nI didn't want my character to have to uphold his kind's law by trying to kill Doll before they had even properly interacted, so I did some impromptu description of the NPCs in my reply post, marking them as humans (why *they* were in the city, I get the feeling I planned an explanation which I no longer remember). Even with that done, though, the fact that a fight had broken out in this most holy of cities wasn't something to be glossed over, and Doll was going to be held accountable whether she wanted to be or not.\n\nI thought the best way to resolve this situation, as well as introduce my character to Doll in a way that might pave the way for future interactions, was to have my Dark Elf play detective in figuring out who did what to start this fight, and then appease the crowds by letting them know that the NPCs that Doll had just taken out were, in fact, the ones at fault. (Whether or not this was actually the case, again, I don't remember.)\n\nThis is where I will admit I made a mistake: I built up my character's actions in his \"investigation\" and concluded my post with him asking a rather accusatory question of Doll in an attempt to create suspense, and I didn't tell Doll's player in private that I was actually intending to take her side. This is probably what led to Doll acting the way she did next:\n\nShe looked up at my Dark Elf with a sultry smile and said, \"What a mess... I guess we have to play now,\" and conjured up a wall of ice between my character and herself, and fled the continent. Not even the city, the *entire continent* that the city sat on.\n\nI mean, I get why she acted defensively, but why the entire continent? What was even the point of her coming this far if all she was going to do was fight some mooks and then run away once it looked like she was going to get repercussions?\n\nTo rub salt in the wounds, she didn't even flee the continent in the way the forum was engineered. See, in this roleplaying forum, the world was divided into subforums, meaning that anyone's actions had to be performed in posts within the subforum that corresponded to the specific setting those actions were taking place in. It was common for a single storyline to consist of multiple threads throughout the forum. The capital city of the Dark Elves was large enough so that it had a subforum for the marketplace alone, but there was also a subforum for the Iron Gates that were the sole entrance and exit to the city, and after that, Doll would have to go through a forest trail before coming to the docks that would allow her to leave the continent.\n\nI made Doll's player aware of this through private messages, and then she edited her post. Her edit described how Doll went through *all of these locations in that one post.* To top it off, she didn't even sequence the locations correctly! Instead, she tackled them in the order I brought them up to her in private, which apparently made her believe that the Iron Gates existed in the middle of the forest instead of at the edge of the city. All you had to do was read the descriptions of the subforums themselves to know where these locations were!\n\nBut wait! I didn't say that this story stopped with just one character!\n\nAfter my Dark Elf tried to smooth over the crowd anyway and left to continue his errands, leaving Doll to whatever natural consequences would befall her afterward (none, from what I recall), he came across another character whom I'll refer to as Slick. Slick was another human visiting this Dark Elf capital for reasons unknown. Also like Doll, he got into a fight with some NPCs and won, failing to describe their race while he was at it. At least in this case, it was clear that the NPCs had started it and he was acting in self-defense.\n\n*However...* Slick proceeded to loot the unconscious bodies of his assailants while my character was watching. Once again wishing to avoid unnecessary confrontation, I took it upon my description to label the NPCs as fallen angels instead of Dark Elves--still making them citizens of the capital, but diminished in importance to the point where Dark Elves would not kill this man for beating them up.\n\nThen things got weird. Slick, upon sighting my character, suddenly rushed up and put a hand on the Dark Elf's hood, for which my character almost pulled a knife on him out of stranger danger, and then backed off, claiming that he mistook my character for his long-lost brother.\n\nThis human--this pale-faced human--thought that my dark-skinned elf resembled his sibling.\n\nOkay, I thought, there's an explanation behind this. Maybe he has an adopted brother. Or maybe there's something else my Dark Elf and his brother have in common. So, against my character's better judgment, I had him ask what Slick's brother's name was. After all, if it was possible for a Dark Elf to be his brother, chances were that my character, a native to the city, might be able to locate him.\n\nSlick's response was as follows:\n\n\"...You wouldn't know him... ...I have nothing more to gain here... ...To the shores of midnight I go...\" (Referring to the Midnight Shores, the name of the aforementioned docks. In other words, he was already planning on leaving the continent.)\n\nWhat. The. Heck. After all my leniency, this guy rebuffed my offer to help him and was already convinced that his brother wasn't on the entire gosh darn continent, let alone the Dark Elf capital city, after ONE case of mistaken identity. My good will had run out at this point. Regardless of the situation involving Slick's brother, my character wasn't about to overlook the pickpocketing Slick did to the NPCs. The Dark Elf cast a spell as Slick was leaving, catching his feet in a kind of shadowy swamp, and demanded that Slick return what he stole.\n\nSlick's response was to shoot fire out of his hands at the swamp below him, trying to propel himself out of it, and he said, \"You can't keep me from my brother...\"\n\nNow I was mentally screaming at this guy, unable to wrap my head around this illogical chain of events. *Forget about your brother, dude! You are being accused of a crime!*\n\nMy character kept up the spell but was quickly drained by Slick's struggling, so he called for help from any nearby Dark Elf law enforcers. Finally, Slick broke free of the swamp and was sent flying into the air by his own fire propulsion, at which point he yelled, \"WOOOOOOO-HOOOOOO!\" as he flew over the Iron Gates.\n\nA more drastic change in character, I have yet to experience again in roleplaying.\n\nThe rest was out of my character's hands, though, as it happened, I had become a moderator of this continent's section of the forum in between my time with Doll and this point, so I now had the ability to roleplay as NPCs in the region. So I did end up taking control of the guards and other law enforcement around the Iron Gates, and sent a small platoon after Slick, which never led anywhere as Slick stopped posting afterward. That's just an anecdote anyway.\n\nUltimately, I believe these people simply did not grasp how fleshed out this world was, nor the cause-and-effect nature that was supposed to be prevalent in it, to say nothing of their absolutely baffling decision-making. I did genuinely like the way this forum handled its own world, and the standards held to the character creation process were generally high enough that I thought anyone who joined in the roleplaying would be serious about it, or at least know what to expect going in. My expectations were dashed in this single jaunt of errand-running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Two characters walk into the capital city of a society already predisposed toward disliking them, commit a petty crime, and then bail once things don't immediately go their way, all in spite of a city native's attempts to help them, each on a separate occasion but one right after the other. And no, it was not the same player.",

            "selftext": "I often got a good laugh out of it because when he still roleplayed, he claimed to be 12-17 or so. He also claims to have British nationality, and claims to not have dyslexia, so it'd be pretty embarrassing for his written English to be this bad would be embarrassing. \n\nHis character was absolutely terrible and had nothing of emotional value attached to it. It was a sort of teenager whose mother was killed by an abusive father at the age of 5, then some disaster happened at school when he was 16 and turned into this giant monster whenever he got angry. Apparently this monster is also beyond the leagues of Godzilla, and was also immortal.\n\nThis next part is very important: I don't hate immortal characters. There are ways to write them properly. I don't hate overpowered characters either. What matters is that each character serves a purpose in the lore, even if it's not a significant one. Characters also don't need to constantly fight each other, which is the most important part of DM roleplays. Characters could just have a pleasant conversation or unpleasant debate but not have to fight physically.\n\nThis guy legitimately thought that making this character as \"edgy\" as possible by adding lore about this weird dinosaurian-looking monster would help, but it doesn't.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that this guy quit roleplaying. You might think this is a good thing but it really isn't. He writes stories about his character and posts them on Wattpad now. Roleplaying would at least give a sort of preview of what he would do with it in the future. He always had plans to write about his roleplays, and so have I. But I use these roleplays to improve on my English, and specifically the dialogue from my characters. I wouldn't want to wind up with terrible characters because I don't know what they're like, and this is why I roleplay before writing anything. These roleplays serve as gateways for new people to get into the lore as well. While I have not finished any of my works yet, I'm planning on writing a few short stories. My first were terrible, so I have to do something about those.\n\nI know this got a little off topic in the end, but it's important to know why you're roleplaying as well. It's not clear why he quit roleplaying either, and the reason he states is more embarrassing than any of his works. He claims to feel shame because he ERP'd literally ONCE, but he isn't bullied or shamed for it. In my opinion, this is no reason to quit roleplay entirely.\n\nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "A long while ago, a friend and I had started rping and we had initially been really into it. Replies would be exchanged quick (about 10-30 min waiting time), plot was amazing, life was going good.\n\n However, suddenly, the replies just suddenly stop coming in. . .? My rp partner and I would talk back and forth, but they just never replied to rp, without saying anything. I would occasionally get a reply once a week, perhaps in a month; but I was super confused with the sudden lack of responses? I asked them if they wanted to take a break, do something else, or just quit rp altogether. However, they insisted that they were still super motivated and that they just kept getting distracted or forgot. On several more occasions, I told them it was alright if they didn't want to rp anymore or if they wanted to slow down the pace. Again, they insisted it was all fine and that they promised to reply in the next hour, only for them to reply a few days later. \n\nThis is making me upset as I invest a lot into my responses, trying to deliver them quickly without comprising on quality. I really love the characters and the plot we have going.\n\n\nI spoke to them about how this was frustrating me and that it makes me anxious (things like this flare my anxiety). I have expressed multiple times that I was okay with stopping, waiting, taking a break, etc. I just simply needed them to tell me; which they aren't? Am I doing something wrong? Am I perhaps being too pushy? This has been going on for a while, I am kinda getting burned out. I feel like they aren't as enthusiastic as me, which they deny each time I confront them on this. :( I don't know what to do anymore. . .",

            "selftext": "I exclusively do 1x1 rps. I find them more fun and less distracting for me. And if worst comes to worst I can just block one person and never think about it again.\n\nAlthough, years ago, I had wanted to have a group of my own. I can't remember why, or even what the story was about now. But wow did I learn that I am not cut out for being a moderator. I get annoyed somewhat easily. Usually when the typical annoying things happen in rp (god modding, anti-social characters, white knights, spammers) I have a very short fuse with people and stop rping with them.\n\nSo it didnt take long at all for me to gice up on the whole group. There was one person (E) who didnt know how to insert their character into interacting with other characters and they acted like it was my job to find someone for them to play with. I did that for them, but this other person (H) didn't seem to understand that your character can't be in three different places at once.\n\nSo the H starts a conversation or something with E and E is typing out a response to it. And then H inserts their character into a different group entirely and understandably so, E thinks that they're not in a conversation anymore. However my problem with E lies in that they said something like \"oh...*throws away response I was working on*\" I can't remember anything about this rp, but I remember that they said that in OOC and it really irked me.\n\nI told H that they can only talk to one character group at a time, but they continued to jump around. It was at that point that I just outright banned H because I'm not a good mod. \n\nI dont know what happened after that, maybe I just gave up the whole thing. I have no interest in group rps so no need to give any advice about it.",

            "selftext": "Reader discretion is advised. This story is about a year old. Happened on a forum site where players need to submit an application that contains info on their character, including a para-style backstory.\n\nI knew this girl would be trouble from the moment she submitted her first two characters. I have pretty high standards when it comes to writing, and she technically wasn't a bad writer. The way she formed sentences and attributed emotions to her characters was pretty good. However, she was obsessed with all kinds of morbid, extreme, fucked-up ideas with no subtlety at all. Like, one of her existing characters was a blatant rip-off of James McAvoy's character in Split (a tasteless cash-grab of a movie that set back mental illness awareness a decade). The other one was an emotionless sociopathic serial-killer Cara Delevingne, LMAO.\n\nThen her third character came. I could already feel something was off as I was reading the backstory. The story was about two little girls, sisters Bella and Celeste, awakened by their distraught father in the middle of the night. She had described in grave detail how the father got them in the car and ignored their questions about the mother, drove them out of town and dumped them at an oil storage site. That was when it clicked for me. I did some quick Googling. I wasn't even an admin, but if I hadn't noticed this, that disgraceful app would have been approved.\n\nDo you guys remember the Watts family? In 2018, this POS Chris Watts was caught cheating on his wife (if I remember correctly), so he strangled her and his 3-4 year old daughters Bella and Celeste Watts. Dumped their bodies at an oil storage site.\n\nSo I continue reading this fucking backstory of some insensitive self-serving cow reimagining, through a heartbreaking murder scene that went on way too long, exactly how Chris Watts could have strangled his three-year-old daughter as the other daughter watched (right at the oil site, in this version). The older daughter was supposed to be her character \u2013 in this story she survived and grew up to be an emotionless sociopathic serial-killer, why, of course.\n\nI was BAFFLED, I still am, and I don't usually use such big Karen words. The sheer insensitivity, the audacity to impersonate these deceased little girls, to paint their tragedies as some villain backstory. I immediately let the admins know and the writer was basically like, *UwU, I guess just didn't think you guys would notice.* That person should get HELP. Rest in peace, Shan'ann, Bella and Celeste Watts.",

            "selftext": "We RP in a forum. There's this RPer who approached me and once we talked, we were very into putting our two characters together. We were excited. I pulled my character out of a boring relationship plot for this one(hurting the other, but.. it really was vanilla) and things were going fun. \n\nWe did more R18 posts because she said she liked it when feelings grow the more sex the characters had, so instead of building their feelings I went along. There were some, but clearly not enough. \n\nI was this RPer's priority for around 2 or 3 weeks. She'd wake up for me to post fast. Somewhere along the line she plotted with another, and... their characters, simply said, have a better dynamic than our current one. They fleshed it out on flashbacks, it was a newly turned vampire and a vampire hunter's son dynamic who used to be lovers. Then a fallout, and a timeskip to the current timeline. There were a lot of hurt, angst, and... lingering feelings they're obviously going to explore. To go for?\n\nAnd i can't help but feel I've already lost, when previously nothing like this was mentioned. They said its not a competition. They said its not set in stone. But I can't help but feel jealous that their plot is so much better, while my character is now no better than a side chick. He doesn't doesnt have a tie to my friend's character because all they did most of the time was sex. I didnt rush development because I didnt expect him to face a literal childhood sweetheart.\n\nNot saying I RP just for the ships, but I've had hopes for this plot and now I feel overshadowed. I got so insecure I ranted at my friend. We can still write together now but. Idk. Why bother to write when what I can offer is now subpar despite what she says? I can literally say nothing positive about our plot. \n\nI want to give up. But I want to make it work. But fuck it's awful that their plot is so much better and I'm just lesser now. Especially since my next thread with her now entirely depends on their plot. They might kiss and my side will just go poof.\n\nIt's so silly I'm torn over rp. It feels like karma too.",

            "selftext": "Godmodding is my second biggest pet peeve when it comes to roleplaying. Characters who are 100% indestructible are no fun to have conflicts with. I enjoy fighting in my roleplays and even more than I love winning, I love fair fights. I definitely take massive amounts of damage but deal massive amounts of damage too. The problem I have though is that apparently their character can see into my mind and predicted what move I was going to use and when so they were able to dodge it. Oh yea and in the split second before it hit them they teleported behind me and poked the back of my head now suddenly my brain is coming out of my nose and the fight is over. \n\nI\u2019ve recently been doing a group rp and even if me and another person explicitly state that we are in an unknown location he just pops up because somehow he \u201cJuSt KnOWs.\u201d And heaven forbid 7 of us teaming up together against him actually win. No no, he manages to take us all out with a single attack or creates different characters on the spot to just pop up behind us and kill us. Come on guys...we can do better than this. Please if you\u2019re gonna roleplay make sure your character has equal amounts of strengths and weaknesses.",
