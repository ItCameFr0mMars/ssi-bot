            "selftext": "So the TL;DR of it is I joined a fantasy, dnd type of rp on a server. It had a promising story so I decided to join. Owners did nothing for the server for nearly a year. Advice of my own will be at the bottom.\n\nWhen I first joined there was a decent amount of people about 10 out of the 25 people in the server. I've talked and made my character. I will have to say it was my first time doing a full on dnd type of rp so it took a while to make my character as I didn\u2019t get much of the mechanics or rules of dnd. But I digress. \n\nThere were two owners. One was on occasionally and the other was on most of the time being the main person who gives the green light for characters. I finished my character and was ready to jump into the story except...there wasn\u2019t that much active rpers in the server. Maybe like two or three active ones? And what strike me was the fact that not much of the server had that many interactions in the channels. I\u2019m thinking this server started two weeks ago but after reading more about the server it started in not in 2020 but in 2018-2019...I didn\u2019t think much of that as I assumed that those were the times that the server was developing and all but looking back THAT IS A MAJOR RED FLAG please be sure to keep this in mind while reading the rest.\n\n\nThere were times when the more active rpers would talk in the \u201drp talk\u201d channel to discuss how their characters would meet up and all, this included the second owner for the sake of not confusing you all will be named C. I found it weird that one of the owners would discuss with the other rps where to meet when they could start making events for the characters to meet. So a few days later I asked more about the server and what the plan was gonna be in terms of events in the rp. I pretty much got vague answers like \u201dsoon\u201d or \u201dwe\u2019re working on it\u201d alright but here's where the red flag for me was showing from this server. \n\nI said something along the lines of \u201dYou're the second owner so you can start up events yourself\u201d. They said that they couldn't because they need the first owner, who I will call F, to initiate the events and all. One of the active rps said that there wasn't a solid plot when the server started up till now (the server started around June or July and at the time of hearing about this it was late June of 2020). They also mentioned how F was busy the whole year and couldn't do anything for the server. \n\nSo to summarize what I said. From 2019 June to now, owner F was busy during that whole duration. Let's break this down, for 13 months there has been little to no character interactions, server development started in 2018 and yet people were saying there wasn't a \u201dsolid plot\u201d. Now I get it, people will be busy, people have a life and have a bunch of responsibilities outside of roleplaying. I'm not going to bother people 24/7 to do this or that for the server but, imagine being in a server for a year with nothing happening. Call me insensitive but nobody- unless you're in the army, work as an essential worker like the post office, nurse or etc is that busy for nearly a year. It was hard for me to be sympathetic about the owner F\u2019s \u201dbusy\u201d schedule as they would come online and post videos of their gameplay in this server as an announcement. You're telling me you got time to be playing and posting gameplay but you can't even make a single event for...a rp server? Had this server been made during the COVID-19 I would've understood completely and be patient with the owners but even then the server wasn't doing anything. What made it worse is that C basically can't even make events without F having a say about it so the server was going NOWHERE for a *year*.\n\nWhat made me super pissed is that everyone was so fucking nonchalant about it. Like \u201dYeah I don't mind about the pace of which this server is going in\u201d. It was clear nobody cared to confront the owners about it until I showed up. So I basically confronted F and basically told me to at least give a single fuck about your server and if you're busy pass on responsibilities to your other owner. I mean what's the point of giving someone a title as an owner when you don't even let them do anything to help make the server fun and interactive. \n\nTo sum it up they were saying how they do put effort into the server and how it took him two years to sit down and create the plot and lore. Congrats, two years of making a story yet you couldn't make ONE event in the rp for a whole year. \n\nSo they promised that they would do the events and would post updates for it. It was going into the right direction until the updates weren't even about the rp...they were about holidays like- great happy Canada day *but what about the update for the server?* Then radio silence for a month. After that I gave up hope and left the server, pretty much wasting 5 months in there waiting for something that probably won\u2019t even come. \n\nIf you managed to read through all of that. Thank you. For those who wanted to see the advice here\u2019s my advice: \n\n*Please for the love of Eros please don\u2019t open your server when you suspect you will be at your busiest. Life is unpredictable but make a plan as to how you will upkeep your server. Bring with you trusted people who will look over your server for when you are gone or busy. Have your admins/mods do things. Lay out events for them to carry out in the rp. This will work but it is only temporary, soon you will have to comeback and work hard to upkeep your server on your end. If any time or day you are free check up on your server. It won\u2019t take that long at best 10 minutes but minimally 5 minutes. You as the Owner created the server so take some responsibility for how it\u2019s running. If you\u2019re going to use the \u201coh I\u2019m too busy\u201d excuse then do the advice above (or anything that more proactive then what I said) or don\u2019t make a fucking rp server in the first place, that will waste EVERYONES time and even yours! And no, inviting more people on the server won\u2019t help. What are y\u2019all gonna do? Have your characters get drunk at the tavern or start up shit to create a fight? There\u2019s only so many interactions players can do without rp events/story direction from admins. Thank you for coming to my Tedtalk.*",

Yeah, me too.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really NSFW, don\u2019t worry. All I\u2019m saying is, I once had a partner who seemed pretty fun to roleplay with. They had the characters occasionally acting as the \u201cI can beat any villain and not get a scratch\u201d type, but I never thought that was too bad. Of course, from those Mary Sue/Godmodder acts, I got numerous red flags. And it wasn\u2019t until my partner mentioned a minor fetish that I got a little irritated.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not shaming their fetish. I\u2019m shaming the way they redirected a roleplay\u2019s plot to have their character (and mine, literally by controlling) get stuffed with food and get fat. When I made my character technically be like, \u201cI\u2019m not eating that much,\u201d my partner controlled my character and said something like, \u201cThe same hunger fell upon [my character].\u201d\n\nAll for their love of getting fat from eating too much.

            "selftext": "I've been a roleplayer for quite some time. I've had my fair share of Mary Sue's and I'll be the first to admit that, when I started out, I made quite a few myself (said characters have since either bene reworked or buried away). So being told that my character was OP, was definitely confusing. The story was as follows (and this is a description that we settled on together): two individuals who have never met before from different walks of life are forced to work together to take down a sinister ring of criminals.\n\nMy character for this particular roleplay was a 27 year old handicapped attorney. She was at the top of her game, a rising star, etc etc, but was hit by a speeding vehicle in a hit-and-run which left her with a permanent injury in her leg, requiring a cane for the rest of her life. Due to her time spent in recovery, she lost her name, lost her money, all her clients, etc etc. Long story short; life happened. She had now become a simple attorney dealing with smalltime cases in a local court. \n\nMy partner's character was a professional assassin, so famous that people cringed at the mention of his name. This character was the one who hit this attorney and caused her accident, and has guilt over it. He continuously watches out for her and has been essentially saving her life from all these random death threats that she's been getting. Ex. he stopped a sniper from taking her out on Wednesday, then  on Thursday, he disables the elevator call button for her so she has to take the stairs, giving him time to have this insane fight with another assassin in the elevator to keep her safe, and then SOMEHOW shoots a custom bullet(? I think? it wasn't clear what the projectile was) into her coffee cup from some insane distance away, shattering the cup to keep her from drinking some poison. \n\nNone of this was decided on by the way. So not only has my character been forced into a \"I'd be dead so many times over if it wasn't for you\" type of role (which I'd expressed extreme dislike for already), but has also been forced into this situation by a child because this world class professional assassin is a 14 year old boy. \n\nTell me you hear crickets chirping because when \\*I\\* read that, the realization definitely had me stunned into silence. I was fuming. I expressed my confusion at this because I'd already stated that I don't play with characters that are younger than 18 and that my understanding was that the characters had no prior knowledge of each other. And then I was hit with: \n\n\"Well to be honest...your character is kinda OP...\"\n\nAnd that's the last of it. I'm debating on just up and abandoning this mess.",

            "selftext": "Hello, back on this subreddit for advices, haha.\n\nOkay. So I met a person on this app who had a great roleplay plot. It was sci-fi, and I was so thrilled, because I haven\u2019t had much of a chance to do any roleplay like that, seeing as I can\u2019t find many who like my plots. Anyway, I commented, we got on Discord, and it was all well and good.\n\nWell, I thought it was anyway.\nSeeing as their writing format for their plot post was tidy, perfect grammar and spelling, I decided to give it a go. But I was a little misled.\nWhen they sent their first paragraph, I was a bit off-putted (Is that even a word-?) by their writing style. I know everyone\u2019s grammar and spelling isn\u2019t top notch, I understand that. But they were writing things like \u201cPls\u201d \u201cthx\u201d etc in the actual roleplay starter. However, I shrugged it off and thought it was a one time thing and wrote my reply.\n\nS\u00f3, we were back and forth for a few hours. Their character was wildly unrealistic, ignored any suggestions I had for the roleplay, and completely missed the point of their own plot they created, and not giving me any genuine material to write a response out of. Not to mention, it\u2019s a huge pet peeve of mine when people use things like \u201cpls\u201d or they slang in an actual roleplay conversation. It seems like a minor thing to be bugged about, I know haha. I brought this up with them but they completely ignored my request. \n\nI don\u2019t want to ghost them, I\u2019d feel bad. It\u2019s been around three days and I still haven\u2019t written a response. I have a valid excuse though. I\u2019ve recently arrived in another country, so I didn\u2019t have time to write on the plane of course. But it\u2019s been a few more days and I have no clue what to write. I\u2019m really not feeling the roleplay. It makes me feel awkward to leave them hanging all these days without a response and then suddenly go \u201cSorry, but this isn\u2019t working for me-\u201c blah blah blah. I really don\u2019t know what to say. Any advice?",

            "selftext": "I have a friend, we\u2019ll call her L, and we\u2019ve been rping together for three+ years now. We have multiple amazing rps together and she\u2019s a pretty great writer, too. Now, I\u2019ve noticed it from time to time but I never really said anything because everyone loves their main ocs. L\u2019s main oc is Jack and she loves him. She loves talking about him, creating AU\u2019s for him, etc. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this. What is wrong with her love for Jack, is her matching love for drama. She\u2019s the kind of writer who gives her ocs tragic backstories, which is also okay nothing wrong with it, but sometimes she takes it too far to sometimes unbelievable levels. This is where the issue comes in.\n\nRecently, I wanted to change my ocs backstory. My oc, Charlie, and her oc, Jack, are siblings. Their parents were abusive in a bunch of ways that won\u2019t be mentioned in this post. I wanted to adjust Charlie\u2019s background because the pieces didn\u2019t really fit right and it didn\u2019t match her personality. I tell L this and she\u2019s all for it. I ask for her opinion on what I want to adjust and she agrees. I\u2019m feeling it out, asking her what she thinks is too extreme, telling her all of my ideas and letting her know that if she thinks something is too extreme or something the parents wouldn\u2019t do, i won\u2019t write it. \n\nShe immediately becomes disinterested and kind of distant, giving short answers and just being extremely bleh about it. She then goes to tell me an idea of mine is \u2018too extreme\u2019 and \u2018unrealistic\u2019. It was simply talking about spaced out feeding since the parents are neglectful. Mind you, her oc, Jack, has multiple scars and trauma from their parents physical abuse that sometimes doesn\u2019t really make sense. All of it goes on without neighbors or teachers noticing or telling anyone which, for the absolutely extent of Jacks scars and trauma, is unrealistic. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s shot down ideas I\u2019ve had for an oc that involve drama and it mostly just seems like she wants all the attention and focus on Jack and doesn\u2019t want to talk about anyone else\u2019s background. \n\nI called her out on it and she immediately got snappy and rude towards me, telling me that she just gave her opinion like i wanted. True but her opinion seemed to just be very much along the unsaid lines of \u2018oh i don\u2019t want this to happen bc jack didn\u2019t experience this or would draw the attention away from him\u2019. \n\nI feel like i\u2019m going a little crazy and like she doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s doing it. My wording is probably really bad so please forgive me, i\u2019m a little rushed writing this. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do or say to her rn because she\u2019s obviously very upset with me for calling her out on her actions. I feel like a jerk. What do I do?",

He was supposed to be bittersweet, because he\u2019s an AI (a robot disguised as any normal civilian) that was going to lash out when his cover was blown, and I was attempting real horror. I was kinda excited to create this side of the roleplay, since I was brewing up some real monstrous entity that malfunctioned and broke down and was a horrifying threat, etc.\n\nNext thing I know, TV makes his character \u201cwake up.\u201d Yup. They wake up and the characters (TV\u2019s and mine) are suddenly where they were when the roleplay first started. A complete time rewind if you think about it. So that means my side of the story was completely scrapped without warning. I bet if I tried again at making a robotic monster to make the roleplay more than just two lovers going out to eat everyday, TV would pull another setback.\n\nOne day, I had told TV \u201cIf you ever don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing, let me know,\u201d OOC. I\u2019m starting to think he forgot what I said.",

See the problem yet? The man\u2019s seat was never really put into place or described, and so I\u2019m thinking anyway, \u201cokay, he was sitting. He got up.

Somehow, AJ\u2019s character is the one walking to the man in the hallway. Somehow, my character can\u2019t see the man from the same table AJ\u2019s character was at.

            "selftext": "Greetings, I am new to Reddit and I just wanted to narrate the events of my first approach to roleplay that happened in a Discord post roleplay, which involved the clash with the worst and most toxic friend group that I ever met in my almost two years experience of roleplay this far, capable of drain fun and enjoyment from a server in a matter of weeks.\n\nI mostly write this to share my experience with other people so in case you will ever meet a similar case, you won't commit my and my friend's mistakes or you could recognize a potential danger and cease the trouble from the start, and also because I am very curious if any of you had similar experiences. I doubt this group of \"friends\" only harassed us.\n\nTo your fortune/misfortune, this post may get quite long, and it will go over something like 2 years of main events. According to what I know I will have to avoid making names and such, but I will be forced to mention different people within this group of \"friends\" (this will be the group name, between air quotes) since they are many and it is important to differentiate, and some other people that I met along the way will have some names too for the sake of comprehension, so I will name most of them with fictional names completely unrelated to them to make distinctions clear.\n\n(Plus I am not a English native speaker, so please point out spelling mistakes of mine, I apologise in advance). Without further disclaimers, here it goes:\n\nI started to roleplay in a middle age / fantasy setting server thanks to a friend of mine, who was the owner of the server (I will call him the Dog) . He is a great person, yet slightly gullible and prone to let problems slide since he doesn't want trouble or arguments. According to what I know (I read the past of the server like general chats and such) the first person of this group of \"friends\" (I will call him the Falcon), came up by his own, claiming that he was very good at roleplay and administering servers, he asked permission to invite his \"friends\" over, and so the Dog said why not, giving the Falcon the benefit of doubt and so other people like the Fox, the Phoenix, the Snake got in, two in particular, Falcon and Fox got admin privileges and they were doing approval job (they were approving characters for the roleplay).\u00a0\n\nThey were doing a good job with no troubles to the community, or at least they didn't do anything my na\u00efve eyes had catched at that time.\u00a0\n\nNevertheless, I made my first character ever on my own and got started into that great server. The Dog was a great admin, a fantastic Gamemaster, he was creative and involved even a newbie like me in big plots. It was all so funny, and even the Falcon or the Snake roleplay, even if a bit secluded and difficult to access were nice to read.\u00a0\n\nAt some point in the story then the game scenario was forced to change due to in game reasons (the kingdom where the game was setted was invaded and everyone had to flee to a deserted archipelago, I tell you that because it'll be relevant later), and that was the first issue I ever encountered that made me suspicious: an admin was kicked out of the game and the server in a nightime.\u00a0\n\nI questioned the Falcon about it, curious of the issue, and the reply I got was: \"She spoke ill of me and the Fox, so she was kicked\". I replied that I didn't see any of that happen in general or oocs, and his reply was: \"she spoke ill every time everywhere, it was subtle in doing that though\".\n\nI shrugged my shoulders and I gave Falcon the benefit of doubt. I had no argument or experience left to argue back. Nevertheless, now the admins were short of one, and so Phoenix took the admin seat too (basically now there were the Dog, the Falcon, the Phoenix, the Fox and a random person who always have kept herself for herself)\n\nEven newbies like me could see that in the new scenario there wasn't much to do, in comparison to the multiple funny quests in the previous land.\u00a0\n\nBut the three admin \"friends\" promised quest would have come in the future, and since a new city had to be built still on one island, people sort of agreed to give them more time. Ultimately, the Falcon, the Fox, the Snake and the Phoenix characters grew a bit much off hand.\u00a0\n\nJust to make some example, the Falcon had a literal Lucifer Morningstar in his hands, the Snake a sort of hybrid of 5 different species with all benefits and little weaknesses, the Fox a sort of creature of balance of magic and life, the Phoenix a reaper that could see when a person was about to die and in charge of moving people to the afterlife.\u00a0\n\nIn the meanwhile (as a fool as I was, added to many other players I didn't see all these powergrowths happen as you and I do now) I was trying to perfection a little my signature character, even if most of my simplest ideas were judged \"impossible\" or \"too powerful\" by the very Lucifer player who could literally snap your character out of existence or the Fox who was bringing new characters for other people from the Purgatory as it was nothing (If you are curious of my requests, I merely wanted my human mage be able to see and interact with souls or get a slight power boost by emotions, nothing bigger).\u00a0\n\nThe roleplay was growing stale as it was turning into a family/power building sandbox, and only player attachment to other players and the Dog was the only reason people kept on playing the game as the only ones to give people happiness and interaction; the Dog in particular, with his witty and funny characters kept me engaged, also because I had an heartwarming ship ongoing with one of his npcs.\n\nThe fun wasn't meant to survive longer though.\n\nFor IRL reasons the Dog went to the hospital and stated clearly in the server he had to get treatment.\u00a0\n\nFast forward 3 months later, some new people, all mutual friends of the Falcon, Fox etc. had joined (the Dragon, the Cat, the Leviathan), and the three admins were growing weary of the \"powerless position\" they had, as if they weren't able to continue to administer the server without the owner rights (which actually it was probably questionable, at least to me), and they conveniently avoided multiple times my texts saying that the Dog was meant to come back after treatment, and it was written right in the server chat itself.\u00a0\n\nSo they killed most of the Dog's characters people had attachment to (such as my char's npc husband) and migrated the server to another one, giving us 1 week of time limit to move to the other place before they would have requested the server from being deleted.\u00a0\n\nI am unsure how they managed to accomplish that but somehow, they migrated everything to a mirror server where the Falcon is the owner.\u00a0\n\nThe server was meant to continue in there, the Cat became empress of the now built empire, and all the other friends of them got to quite important position within the roleplay and the server.\u00a0\n\nBecause you must know, it is quite clear these people are IRL friends, some also blood-related according to them, I am unsure if that is a lie.\u00a0\n\nThey have a hive mentality, and they tended to monopolize the lore of fantasy by not accepting something they considered \"impossible\" (See my mage that according to them wasn't allowed to see spirits), and each member specialized over one particular topic (eg the Fox was the magic know-all, the Falcon was all about demons and angels, the Dragon was all about dragons and spirits), which it wouldn't be completely bad if they weren't refusing to explain their lore to you or posted their sources for you to learn their ways. Instead they kept on keeping their knowledge to themselves but forbidding you from having certain powers or performing certain actions. It was like having you play a game without explaining the rules to you thoroughly and burning the rule book but expecting you to know everything\n\nApart from that, their hive mentality occured if you were to attack one; it would have meant that all the others would have joined to protect the ally.\u00a0\n\nThe Snake for instance, at this point was quite eager to jump on you with much passive-aggressiveness, and the second you spoke something back, you were muted or threatened by the admins, while the Snake was warned that \"next time you will be punished too\".\u00a0\n\nI have seen a couple of people leave the server due to an argument caused by the Snake and the uselessness of the Admins.\u00a0\n\nTwo years from that, I still see that excuse come up nowadays. It is clear she'll get away with anything thanks to her contacts between admins.\u00a0\n\nIf you wonder why the only neutral admin didn't act, it's because she was quite busy all the time an argument was up.\n\nFurtherly, these people tend to brag much of their accomplishments, which at this point I realized they are mostly lies, but at that time, I wasn't smart or knowledgeable enough to know.\u00a0\n\nFor instance the Snake has something like 7 time consuming hobbies which executes at professional level plus having to work and studying, the Fox is a brilliant lawyer, Falcon a professional streamer... The list could go on for ages, depending on the mood or the topic people are discussing.\n\nYou can think anything about me, but I was gullible enough to believe all that stuff, mostly because it was one of my first experiences on the net ever, and so my confidence got severely mined by their lies and abuses.\u00a0\n\nThey made me think they were the most successful people in the world, while I had no talent whatsoever and I was failing something trivial anyone else would have breezed through.\n\nRoleplay became only a chore to me, especially for the lore matter and the language barrier (I wasn't that great with English, and they never failed to point that out in DMs for any small mistake I made) I had many conversation with the Falcon and the Fox, asking for guidance, while they were telling me I had to stop self hating myself or they wouldn't have never helped me, and the Snake comments over my work made me change things I thought unique of me and that now that I think of it, they weren't that bad. But such was the power of her manipulation over me.\n\nThe miracle happened when the Dog finally came back one month later their take over, with a new rp in another server he didn't tell the Fox and the others about. I was quite skeptical to join, but he and his friend told me that I was brilliant, and they gave some of my creativity back to me. It was enough to tear away some rings of the chains I had with the Fox and the Falcon, I was finally back slightly more sane, or at least a bit more free from their manipulative hands.\n\nJust as a bonus to make you understand they wanted to keep the power high ground and how much negligent they are, I asked my sister (She's also a roleplayer( to post a mildly powerful character of hers in the server (an elven thief that worshipped a goddess of treachery, nothing in comparison to the already mentioned Lucifer), it took something like 4 months to receive 4 denials, and a further begging in DMs to receive the feedback of why the character was denied.\u00a0\n\nI just tell you that @ the admins in the approval box while they were chatting or roleplaying caused you to have your character delayed because quote: \"you must learn patience padawan\". That was a reply from them, I am not joking.\n\nFurthermore, my sister called the Phoenix with her username, which happens also to be the Phoenix's real name, and that made her so upset she didn't approve at all (I wonder if it is my sister's fault if you post your own sensitive information in your nametag).\n\nMoving along and returning to my point of view, those days in that new roleplay server of the Dog were fun, very much fun in comparison to what I was experiencing in the Falcon's server.\u00a0\n\nThere isn't much to tell about that place, apart from the fact I was happy again, and one day I spoke to my sister about all that was going on in my head, and she suggested me to leave that server. I agreed with her, and few days later, I spoke about it to the Falcon and the Snake in a DM that I wished to leave the server. I don't have to narrate to you the hell on earth I caused by saying I wanted them to collaborate into the leaving of my own characters. Apart from the insults, all the \"friends\" admins wrote to me to find out why I was doing something so heartless, the Snake wrote an heartbreaking message in general shaming me for backstabbing her, stuff like that.\u00a0\n\nBasically, they were guilt tripping me into not leaving, which at some point I was forced to agree into not do so (I know, I would slap myself in the face too and I don't blame you guys for wanting to do that too). In the end, after eight painful hours of arguing, I explained my problems and the admins sworn to solve them. The fact they used the good cop bad cop method to keep me engaged was irritating and I began to notice it, and at this point I was quite aware they were doing that on purpose.\u00a0\n\nYet I stayed in, or at least I was present in that place, without writing much more than needed.\n\nMoving along, in the Dog's server (the fun one) I got to know a girl, that I will call Wolf. That person was present in the \"friends'' server too and ultimately ee began to exchange information between each other, and I found out that she was trashed around by them in a similar way I did, probably worse since she got mental problems due to their mind games and was actually romantically tied to the Snake IRL and her and Falcon were most likely messing with her psyche and constantly forbidding her to get external help for this problem.\u00a0\n\nFrom her however, I got some further hints of how those people were twisted and liars.\n\nFor instance, she told me the friends were promoting some Erps involving minors and incests, a confirmation I had also from another player who had the misfortune to join the group DM.\n\nIn the end, we became friends and she made me, the Dog and my brilliant partner of role (and life), which I will call the Owl\u00a0 who started here to roleplay for the first time and joined the Wolf's own server.\u00a0\n\nA couple of months later, due to the owner\u2019s benevolence and forgiveness, the Falcon and the Snake joined the Wolf\u2019s server and later all of them had.\u00a0\n\nSome of them brought their old characters of signature, such as Lucifer, while others joined just to support them in the arguments that came later.\nThe template had a weaknesses tab, and some of them never had the decency of writing them, also being very vague with the powers they had. When the admins tried to ask to be more specific they replied that their powers had to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d in RP since they were afraid of metagamers, despite there was a rule that prevented it.\n\nDuring an event, involving six characters of several people, we witnessed Lucifer suddenly ascending from the sky and clearing the battlefield (and the event) with a snap, literally. One of the most underwhelming and disappointing conclusions for any player.\n\nIt happened that the public lore had on its list an ancient artifact made by a god of some sort, yet the Falcon had little regard over it, and altered it with his characters with no problem, manipulating the lore at his own benefit, as if that RP was only an RPG to win and dominate completely.\n\nHowever, the most unfair action they actually performed was an assassination attempt that was successful due to the fact that the actual unhealable poison was crafted and concealed in a DM no admin knew about. That brought to the death of two characters (one an important npc that was needed since he was a king of a country the \u201cfriends\u201d weren\u2019t really controlling) that died instantly, with no possibility for us to counter it basically. I found it very unfair and spoke against that unfair move, and my Game Master tag was taken away over their demands. I got it back up soon enough, but the point is that despite in clear wrong, they still acted as innocent victims. From that point on, it was a war between admins of our server (Me, the Owl, the Wolf and some others) and the \u201cfriends\u201d all together.\n\nAt some point the \u201cfriends\u201d decided to create a server called \u201cPeace-talks\u201d in order to restore peace between them and all the people they had mistreated during the last year. \nA new person joined, who I will call the Rabbit; she was considered \u201cThe goddess of cuteness\u201d, a loli girl that no one could hurt or contrast because of her childish and \u201ccute\u201d behaviours. Everytime a fight started, she always sent virtual hugs or whined like a baby, and no one couldn\u2019t say anything when she started to \u201ccry\u201d. In the peace-talk server, in fact, it was okay for her to talk about her mental illness and how she felt discriminated (also calling us nazis) while it was not for us. Besides her, other two people joined to be the so called \u201cwardens of neutrality\u201d, but were they neutral? Of course not, since they were old acquaintances of the \u201cfriends\u201d. One was the already mentioned Leviathan. Another will be called the Turtle, a self-proclaimed RP veteran, which everyone of the \u201cfriends\u201d considered an actual god of roleplay because he was \u201cold\u201d and he wrote in literated RP style even in OOC discussions with semi forbite lexic (During all their RP in their server, they reached at best semi-literate, and they considered their server one of the best and any other server were considered \u201cInferior\u201d and \u201cTrying to make diamonds out of coal\u201d).\n\nThe Peace-talks went on for something like two sessions of two evenings, where we raised problems such as how they were blatantly trying to take over the server like they did with the server the Dog once owned in RP and as Admins, how the Rabbit had posted a character that was basically the copy of my signature one and how they murdered two characters while hiding everything about the plot in DMs.\u00a0\n\nThe \u201cwardens\u201d were always active to shut our voice while being silent even when we got insulted and called Nazis from the \u201cfriend\u201d\u2019s side. Any time we got a point right, a pause of 5 minutes was raised, and despite the \u201cfriends\u201d being the majority of people in there (a ratio of 3/1 people) they struggled to hold their ground, because they were dead wrong and with their mouths only full of empty excuses.\u00a0\n\nLong story short, they were purged from the Wolf\u2019s server when we realized that the third Peace-talk was useless in any aspect.\u00a0\n\nThe server however never recovered from it. Too much toxicity was raised, and as the \u201cfriend\u201d\u2019s server, it is now an empty shell of its former glory.\u00a0\n\nThis was my story and my friends\u2019, of how two servers died because of these parasites that call themselves roleplayers but they are only manipulative sad people, and how we were all fooled by them, how many friendships were ruined and they only now are healing up. Me, the Owl, the Wolf, the Dog are still roleplaying all together, yet we all are still scarred by this traumatic experience.\u00a0\n\nThank you if you have taken time to read through all this. It took time and people's efforts to recollect all these painful facts together, in a story that may tell you if some people are actually manipulating and gaslighting you and taking fun out of your favourite hobby.\u00a0\n\nI am available for discussions and PMs in case you want to ask about proofs, names or anything else regarding my story, which I have in most parts.\n\nI wonder if you ever encountered similar people or situations. These people seemed slightly sure of what they were doing, despite their motives are still unknown by this date. I would like to also know your experiences with similar situations so please feel free to comment with your stories or PM me about it.\nThank you all again",

I want to clarify that I don't expect people to just suddenly act like we are best friends, but I expect a little chit chat on the side. I am somewhat of an advanced writer, so a minimum of four paragraphs per reply. Not being able to get to know the person you are writing literal pages of text to every day is weird to me. I've tried to initiate conversation outside of one of my current roleplays and my partner doesn't seem to care to talk at all. They will answer/ask questions but stop responding when it comes to conversations.   \n\n\nMaybe it's just me, but not being able to understand my writing partner as a person makes it incredibly hard for me to write with them. I am the type of person who replies daily, sometimes multiple times a day depending on my partner. Though lately, it's becoming difficult to keep that up. Despite posting at least once a day, my partner isn't shy in the slightest to tell me to hurry up. I love the plot idea, the characters, but I just don't feel involved. They make all the big decisions with the plot, my suggestions are kinda lightly swept to the side. I find myself only writing the bare minimum to my standards because I feel like if I write more then it would just be a waste of time. I don't get any feedback on what they think of my posts, the plot feels forced, and the writing partnership also feels forced.   \n\n\nI don't want to write with someone who feels like they are forced to talk to me. If you don't feel a connection enough to spark a friendship then there isn't a point in writing with me. I base a lot of my posts on the emotions of the characters, if I have no emotion towards my writing partner then it makes it hard to develop emotions for my partner's characters. Maybe it's time to cut my losses and try the plot another time. This partner isn't a bad person or anything, but to me, writing is a lot more than just words.",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for around 3 years now and it\u2019s always been a pretty fun escape. It gives me a chance to get creative with my writhing while having to respond so quickly. There\u2019s no denying the joy that\u2019s so easy to find when you get lost within a story.\n\nI still keep in touch with a lot of my Roleplay partners that got me into it in the first place. But the past few months have been rough on a few of us due to the pandemic and our schedules don\u2019t always line up. So I\u2019ve been reaching out more lately to find newer partners and I\u2019ve came across a few that have been a blast. But again, scheduling often means that we\u2019re able to do it every so often. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m posting here today. The reason I\u2019m posting here today is a common issue that\u2019s always been a problem within any Roleplaying community that I\u2019ve ever interacted with and it\u2019s \u201cghosting\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve had our fair share of it. You start to hit it off with someone and then all the sudden they decide you\u2019re just not interesting anymore, and Instead of telling you this up front, they decide to leave you hanging for a while. Which results in constantly messaging \u201cyou still there?\u201d And around a few hours you kind of just get the message that they will never respond. I\u2019ve never personally understood this as I find it super easy to communicate with others on what I don\u2019t think is exactly working within the story we\u2019re crafting. I guess I just don\u2019t get it because I hate knowing I left a bad impression on someone. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think this would be that bad, but hearing what I\u2019m not doing right could help. It could possibly save the entire RP, especially if you spent so long on the set up. But it\u2019s obvious at that point that they\u2019d rather move on I guess. \n\nMy final thing that bothers me is that I try to make sure every entry I make satisfies the person I\u2019m writing with so I won\u2019t get into this situation.  It drives my anxiety crazy knowing that ghosting could be coming ahead when I\u2019m feeling comfortable within the story. And makes the anxiety sting worse when the ghosting does come along. Because now, my time has been wasted as well.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to get this off my chest. It\u2019s something I try to get used to in the Roleplaying community and I guess I never will as long as I have anxiety here and there. But anyways, if you\u2019ve read this far, I\u2019d love to know your opinions on this topic. Does fear of ghosting raise your anxiety levels when engaging with a new Roleplaying partner? I\u2019d be happy to hear about it in the comments section.",

            "selftext": "So, I joined Superhero RP discord server, basically you submit a character with their own traits/powers/mutation and Moderation rates their power. And, one thing to clear out, is that there is no system, pure roleplay when it comes to combat. The city, where RP takes place in, is big authoritian structure that makes laws  against People with super powers, and create squads/Factions designated to hunt people who abuse those powers, and with that being clear...\n\nTwo players were looking for a Dm that would DM them a hostage rescue mission, I posted a message, with powers of terrorists (It was like, 2-3 terrorists with minor powers like mutated arm. Players asked that hostage situation should take place on construct side.) And the terrorist leader being a rebel who is looked as criminal for using their powers, who takes civilians hostage to prove a point, that government discriminates people with super powers UNLESS they join specific designated squads, in sense bullying them as outcast of society, if they chose to not participate in patroling the city, and refuse to bring financial, social, or law assistance.\n\nThe next thing I see is that this player denies me with \"well my character would support them instead of fighting them, lol.\" (Who is not a person with super powers, but something of marine/SWAT member), the second player just shrugged and supports first player.\n\nNow, I understand that this might be a little asshole of me, but back then I was about to explode with  something along those words: \"Well, if you want braindead terrorists who does bad things because they're just mutated abominations left alone, fine, go on.\", but I DID hold myself together, and typed \"Okay, I tried.\".\n\nBut like, man, why would you disagree? This would make Roleplay so much better with your character trying to negotiate, try other ways, or in end, hesitatingly killing/arresting the terrorist leader. But apparently they either don't like that, or want to be the generic hero who \"defeats the evil that can't be reedemed\".\n\nThat's all for my vent.",

            "selftext": "So it's a rare moment when I find myself needing to vent about Roleplaying. I've been doing this for about ten years and I've ran into this problem before. However I thought I would see what the general consensus is. \n\nA couple of days ago I posted for something very specific in the realm of a fandom. Specifically, I was looking for something in the vein of a fanzine. Specifically, it was something called Titans Casual which like I said was kind of a Fanzine from a favorite artist of mine. I wanted to do something capturing the vibe of the fanzine. It inspired me... more or less. \n\nI got an interest from someone who I was already doing something with. We had barely begun the previous thing and it was over on Discord. I reached out on our server and asked them if they wanted to do both. They made it clear they were interested in doing two of the characters and I mentioned I wanted to do multiple characters within it and then never got a response. I figured that meant they didn't want to do it anymore and were trying to ghost. \n\nFast forward today and I noticed she had posted an interest on the account I knew her of. She was more or less looking for the same thing but stated specifically Raven and Garfield. I was a little... aggravated by that given that it was an idea I was still looking for but given it was a fandom and something inspired by someone else I kind of waved it off. \n\nWhat's interesting is now she's bombing the idea. Like posting it everywhere under multiple accounts. The only thing that sucks about it is that I can't really post looking for it anymore. She's more or less thrown it over every roleplay subreddit on here. She keeps removing them then reposting them ect ect like some weird shuffle game.",

We\u2019ve been together for around a year now and I can say with confidence they are my best friends. Sadly, I\u2019ve run into an issue. Whenever I play villain characters and they have to go up against the MC, they sometimes can\u2019t even get a hit in. I think this might be a little bit my fault, as whenever I rp fights I always put \u2018tries\u2019 or \u2018attempts\u2019 in there. (e: Bob tries to ram Jim into the wall behind them, swiftly moving his legs as he grapples him and barrels towards it.) (I apologize for bad writing there-) I also try to be realistic, meaning that a hurt character might be slower and worse with attacks than a faster one. I want enemies to be more scary and investing, so the group of mcs (which I adore) taking them down like a house of cards isn\u2019t really ideal. I also really wanna avoid arguments and fights, because these guys are my second family at this point. What should I do to change this? I really don\u2019t wanna hurt anyone involved.\n\nSorry for bad formatting, on mobile.",

            "selftext": "Ok so all of this happened in a Discord server, any names I use are the names of characters the people played.   \n\n\nSo I was in this Marvel group and it was small and I considered everyone kinda my friend. One of my very close friends got me to be a mod too. The only thing was the owner (who was 19 and I'm calling Steve) and this one person (who just turned 13 and I'm calling Tony) was way too close like uncomfortable at times. Granted maybe for most people it might have more seemed like Steve had a more motherly instinct to protect someone almost 10 years younger than them.   \n\n\nThat was till maybe 2 weeks ago and Steve came on and randomly said \"Tony's stomach is cute\". Which made me very uncomfortable even though later Steve explained it was a tik tok. Not that it helped all that much. Well, a day or so later I called them out. I said I was uncomfortable and maybe in the future phrase it differently like \"Tony's stomach is cute in this tik tok video\" or something. And they unmodded me. Later when I and my friend I mentioned earlier (I will call him Stephen) asked Steve and all they said was it was because I hurt their feelings. I got unmodded for politely explaining I was uncomfortable? That makes sense I guess. I mean I know Steve was already a bad person considering they paid no mind to triggers even though there was a list of triggers but they also had very obvious favourites to the point some people were uncomfortable.   \n\n\nHowever, this is where the story gets worse. Steve eventually added their friend Sam who was also just about 13 and talked way too much in the NSFW channels and they even have admitted to doing sexual rps. So the 19-year-old confirmed doing srp with barely a teenager.   \n\n\nThis area is a little spotty because I still never became a mod again but at some point, Steve had made a private chat for the mods of the server. So themselves, Tony, Stephen, and another close friend of mine, Natasha. Well anyway, there was this little phenomenon where names would randomly be changed. Stephen ended up sending me screenshots of Steve and Tony joking around about changing people's names and finding it even funnier when the person started to get upset their name changed every few seconds. So yeah these people were dicks to other group members behind closed doors too.    \n\n\nNow, this part happened maybe Saturday I'd say. Stephen talked to Steve and eventually got Steve to agree to let me be a mod again not that it lasted long Steve took it away after a few hours like I wouldn't notice or something. But on top of that the next day they added this special little treat to the server by the name shit-head.   \n\n\nSo I knew shit-head before. And basically to sum up what happened there. They pretended to be my friend for a few months before adding me to a group chat with some of their friends just to make fun of me. and bring up shit that was 3 YEARS OLD. Bring up shit I did 3 years ago. And one of their friends kept screenshots of me just talking about it for 2 years. And Steve knew me and shit-head had problems. So they added shit-head just to add more. And basically what happened was all shit-head did was target me and Stephen mainly by talking about the shit I did 3 years ago. And by now I was in a panic attack. The last time I felt that scared was when I was literally admitted to a mental hospital. That's how bad things got. Not to mention they also hated me for other random stuff. Like I'm into vulture culture kinda stuff. And this was like an absolute sin to them. Like I was going to the deepest pit of hell just for picking up random bones in the woods.   \n\n\nAnyway, this story ends good-ish. I added people as friends and made another group chat just so I can stay in touch with the really nice people and people I trusted. So I get to keep people I made friends with, without having to deal with the toxicity of Steve, Tony, and shit-head. Granted I know another group chat was made where they made fun of me a lot but I don't want to get into that considering I don't have anything from it other than word of mouth. So that's where this story ends and I hope it doesn't continue.",

Here are some of the reactions which annoy me sooo fucking much:\n\n\\-I have a stressful job/ a chronic health issue/ mental health problems, and I am still able to find to post once a day. Just try harder.\n\n\\-If you get really interested in the rp, you must be able to reply on a daily basis, so lets see if it works out. If it doesn't, you did not like the rp enough.\n\n\\-If you don't invest enough time in roleplaying, why are you writing rps? \n\nI get it. Everyone has different post frequencies. If you think that ours don't match, just tell me and leave. It will not change when you try to make me feel guilty about it. It will also not change if I tell you this in the beginning, you say nothing and start a roleplay with me, and then get angry when ...the exact thing happens that I already told you will happen and I don't reply daily. \n\nOr, another big no-no: I talk with someone about the things I definitely don't want to write (for example sex scenes), and they reply with something like:\n\n\\-We will see if we write this when we get there.\n\nHell no.",
