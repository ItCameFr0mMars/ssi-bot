            "selftext": "I have really no idea what to say about this, maybe you guys can help me out here.\n\nI am roleplaying with this talented, and extremely friendly writer on Discord. it\u2019s a novella length, 1x1 rp story revolving around an original story we made together. \n\nEssentially, the plot focuses on two twins who have no idea that they are twins until near the end, who hold the keys to either destroy or rebuild the world.\n\nOutside of the two twins, there are a multitude of characters ranging from villains to good guys, and even some basic side characters too. It\u2019s a pretty chill, very interesting story about influences and how such influences can shape people later on.\n\nWe\u2019ve been roleplaying for about maybe a few months, and it\u2019s fantastic. Lots of good development, lots of good story, lots of good everything actually. We have our flaws sometimes in making plot holes, but these are usually explained away in intricate, believable ways.\n\nBut, recently, things have been getting really, really weird. Sometimes, I\u2019ll type up a post, around 20-30 lines since that\u2019s the length we agreed on along time ago, and it will be chock full of important things to note, things to look out for, that sort of stuff. And even introductions of new plot points.\n\nAnd sometimes those plot points are ignored, not talked about, glossed over, or just met with some sort of weird, out of character response of annoyance towards the introduction of a plot point at hand.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example. Recently, I presented a subplot that revolves around the Male Twin\u2019s parents, whom of which are missing. His goal is to find them and bring them back to him, and has been searching for clues and signs of their wellness and sanity. He\u2019s pretty blank and emotionless outside of that, and devotes most of his energies into finding his parents.\n\nFor added context, the Male Twin and his Female Twin battle partner have faced extreme hardship, where the whole world seems out to get them and exploit them for something they are still rather skeptical of having (destroying/rebuilding the world). Even though they\u2019re in a tight knit group with other people, they feel extremely stressed out and overwhelmed.\n\nIn a meltdown of stress, the Male Twin begins to cry and ask for help from someone, anyone. And two orbs come out, floating around him and spinning with delight and wonder to distract him from his pains. \n\nWhat I got in response to the emotional scene was a completely unrelated conversation, a complete deflection and vague response to Male Twin\u2019s orb show, and some sort of callous response to what he had seen. \n\nThe group members chastised the Male Twin for sharing about the Orbs, and the topic was dropped just like that. Suddenly, the Female Twin went against him, some of his friends expressed some sort of sheep mentality and ALSO got mad at him about the Orbs, and no one really seemed to want to discuss further about the orbs, even though that COULD have been a great subplot beginning to the Male Twin\u2019s further development.\n\nEven when I tried to bring them up again, my partner glazed over it, and continued forward with the story. And I\u2019m just wondering, if she didn\u2019t like the plot point, why the hell didn\u2019t she just say so? She literally made such an awkward scene about the Orbs and it seemed kinda off to me.\n\nOutside of that example, sometimes I\u2019ll write crucial details that might have happened in my longer posts, such as a character getting injured or something as such, and the next post, my partner will NOT notice that one of my characters were  highly injured, and would continue on the story as normal, as if they didn\u2019t even fucking read the post and merely skimmed it. \n\nI have had to tell her multiple times. A character got hit, a character was thrown, a character was in pain, a character does this...and it\u2019s just fucking tiring. I shouldn\u2019t have to keep reminding her all the time of these things. Does it pain people to read?\n\nAnd besides the constant reminding, She constantly ignores crucial details and plot points and doesn\u2019t seem to mention these things out of possible ooc annoyance or just ignorance in general.\n\nSorry for the incoherence, I\u2019m tired and extremely pissed off.\n\nTl;dr : My writing partner sometimes ignores details of my posts or expresses a weird adversity to it, and needs to be constantly reminded of said post actions over and over again.",

            "selftext": "My biggest pet peeve in a roleplay is when a person tries to make it all about them. They take total control of the story and plot, all the time.\n\nNow, the particular partner this often happened with had some fun plots. They would last months and I was happy to participate!! It was great fun. But the issue was that after one of theirs finished, they started another immediately.\n\nSo basically, I could never properly arc my OCs.\n\nI eventually got my own plot going. But it, despite involving OCs which her characters were intimately involved in, was pretty much glanced over. Her responses gave me nothing to work with. It was a sci fi setting on an alien planet and the characters were mostly soldiers, and in the phase of planning an attack against the big bad guy, they pretty much didn't involve their characters. The plot took them off the planet and even though they oocly said they were impressed with the lore I'd made for said planet, they barely wanted to explore it and their ocs the whole time were like \"wehhh lets go home\".\n\nThen, smack dab in the middle of my plot, they started another one of their own. A big one. Even though mine hadn't been resolved. I was... Kinda insulted, honestly. We agreed to intertwine our plots and our villains were going to be lovers, but... She sort of just stopped replying to that chat.\n\nWe made a few other rps and the same things happened. Once I had even a whiff of plot going, or something major happening to arc one of my characters, she would give half assed replies, stop replying for days, then start a new scene despite that one not having resolved. \n\nBasically, if her characters weren't the center of it, she wasn't interested. My characters never had any big moments, but hers had tons of hype and excitement. Again, I wasn't just a tag along in her stories... I did lots to advance the plot and we actively discussed where it was heading. But when I was directing it, and we were discussing where it would go? She would give me NO ideas. Just \"yeah that sounds good\" \"idk\" \"ok\" \"sure\" like shit are my plots really that boring...?\n\nAnyways, moral of the story-- unless you're the GM directing the rp all the time, give others the limelight and participate it plots instead of being a wet noodle.",

            "selftext": "I RPed online in my youth but school, college, and getting a grown up job got in the way. So when I got to work from home because of the global pandemic, I was a bit excited to get back into this hobby. \n\nHere is a general over view of some of the bad RPer experiences I've had the delight of engaging with since the plague began. This is probably going to be a long post, we'll pretend it's just me being a detailed RPer. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n***The world builder***\n\nI responded a few ads I thought sounded fun. One responded immediately and away we went. \n\nThe first one was the standard \"I've built this super in depth world and I want you to join me in it.\" \n\n*Great* I'm not super into doing the world for a world build anyway. \n\nI read pages and pages of detailed world history that got us to the post apoc setting. We created the characters together. His is the standard chosen one, destined to save the world. And mine the stoic guard who defends the status quo and is lured into his rebellion to save the world. And time to start. So I wait. He messages me OOC and asks me to start. \n\n*Um, okay?* So I go in for it. And *every* **single** reply from this guy gave me nothing to work with. His hero character was passive, the plot did not move forward, and unless my character did something *nothing happened*. \n\nI message, asking for some plot hooks or something. He responds he thinks this is going great. I trudge forward. Another few days of this mediocre plotting go by and I message OOC again, saying basically, 'Thanks for playing but I'm done' (in much nicer words). And he *fights me on it* \n\nNow this was my first foray back into role playing after over a decade away from the hobby so I was *flattered* that my RPing was so good that this guy didn't want to let me go. So I was guilted into another week of plotless roleplay in this dude's *detailed* world with no plot. Before I tapped out again. He fought me on it again.\n\nLesson from this RP, if after you say you're done, it's okay to *be* done. You did the courtesy of not ghosting, you can leave. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n***The psychologist***\n\nThis guy was something special, and not in a good way. I responded to an ad for a truly dark and twisted RP to get into the mind of a serial killer and the lady who hunts him. I love Criminal Minds and thought *could be fun*. \n\nI. Was. So. Wrong.\n\nThis guy came prepared with the most detailed OOC pregame character questionaire I've ever seen before or since. No identifiable information, but just *odd*.\n\nThings like, \"When your character dresses for the morning what direction are the windows? NSEW. Follow up: What is the window dressing? Blinds, drapes, curtains, other: please specify\"\n\nAs the naive RPer fresh out off the world builder disappointment, I just figured RPing had gotten much more serious since my Twihard days. So I do it, answering all the questions giving a profile Jodie Foster could 100% have used when playing Clarice. \n\n*Then* things got weird. I cannot emphasize enough my naivete with his one, that I didn't think it was weird until *this point*. He starts asking *me* those sorts of questions and I'm not about that life so I tell him, no I'm here for RP you don't kneed to know if my bedroom has Eastern exposure. \n\nHe starts spewing all this nonsense that it's essential for the RP that he has an accurate read of my limits so he doesn't cross them. (A thing which on this rp partner sub was standard in the first message so he already had this info). Finally acting with more sense than a horror movie token character, I end the rp. \n\nAnd again, my partner fights me on it. Well, I had learned my lessong from the World Builder and wasn'ta bout to put up with that. The next day the psychologist messages me *apologizing* for being creepy and asking if we can do a sweet romantic RP. \n\nThat was a no from me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis post has gotten pretty long so I'm going to stop here, but that was just scratching the surface of the nonsense I've been dealing with the past 6 months. (granted most of my really bad rpers wer ERP and I'm not sure how detailed we can get on the sub)\n\nStay safe and  sane out there. May your role plays be engaging, your partners be fun, and your inboxes be filled with quality.",

            "selftext": "So there's this one rp subreddit (you probably know which one. It's a pretty big one) is a pain in the ass to advertise my servers on. Almost all of my ads for my servers and even myself have been taken down. Most I have no idea why.\n\nSo my first ad was taken down for voter manipulation. I did..literally nothing. It got a some upvotes. Like 16, but nothing I didn't do anything to cause that.\n\nSecond one I kinda understand. I mentioned it had NSFW but didn't put it was only for 18+ members. So it was taken down. That one I understand,\n\nAnother one of mine I had no idea why. Maybe it was because it was furry friendly? But I'm not too sure.\n\nMy next post was a personal ad. I wanted to find a new discord server away from the ones I run. My post was almost immediately taken down because they thought I was looking for hub or collection servers? In the ad I said I was looking for a fantasy rp server. I swear I don't get it. What did I do wrong?\n\nSo it was decided that my friend, another person who runs the server with me, was going to advertize the server instead of me. Maybe the way I say stuff is wrong or something. And for the first ad, it was fine, But my friend second ad was taken down for a being a hub? It was literally, the same ad as the one not taken down. \n\nI tried a few times sending messages to the mods but the answers I got weren't even helpful in the slightest. -\\_- It sucks cause when do post we get a few good members so it's a good place to advertize. It just seems really dumb at times.",

And then bam, got a response that they had lost the desire to continue and that their character would be better suited with someone else. Then they removed me from server and blocked me before I could even respond to ask what happened, or see if I could fix it. \n\nI am crushed. Literally. I anticipated each response, loved the story, was enjoying everything. And now I don\u2019t even know what to do. Am at a total loss. I figured that since we seemed to get along OOC, that my partner would have given me better warning that something was wrong. I wish they had. I would have gladly tried to fix it. Now I don\u2019t even feel like bothering to rp any more. Very rarely does anyone respond to my rp ads, even rarer still that I find one that makes it worth it. Now I am back at it, questioning why.

They continuously insist that we are a \"hub server\", and don't care when we've reassured them that we're not.\n\nWhen we shot down their first claim, they made another: now suddenly because our settings alternate, we're not a \"roleplay group\" at all. So we changed the setting so that we no longer make use of our alternating setting, and settled on a single setting, PER this group's \"guidelines\", and posted a fresh ad over a month later - and were instantly tempa-banned.\n\nThis is a blatant misuse of power and an issue of control that has no place in roleplay.

            "selftext": "I'm not gonna lie, I do prefer literate roleplay, or advanced literate. I'm not about to shove it in someone's face until I hear them speaking about themselves like they're some kind of god. For example, someone contacted me recently- entirely at random. Well, okay, that's perfectly fine. And then they started asking for 1x1 roleplays. That's not usually my deal, and I explained that, and then offered for them to join my group-\n\n*I don't join groups because none of them are up to my standards. Unless I'm running it or in a staff position, they're likely not going to be my cup of tea.* \n\nNot *exactly* how she put it, but the exact same words. Just disguising it, never know who's gonna be peeking on the thread. But okay. I get it. So it sucks. However, even despite me saying that I've built it to my specifications \\[which are, according to them, the exact same as theirs??\\] they don't even bother to check it out. I get it, you're not *obligated* to check it out, but you just basically told me what I work on isn't up to your specifications at all, therefore you won't even join to look at it. \n\nThen you ask me what roleplay genres we'll do together. Not only did I *just* tell you I don't do 1x1, you pretty much reverse and tell me all about your group, all about what you like, and you *still* want to do 1x1s. Beyond that, they've been bothering consistently. I've never *sought* 1x1 roleplays, so I don't know if this counts as ghosting- but I want to be gone. *My* standards happen to be someone who appreciates roleplay in all forms even if it's not their cup of tea and doesn't seem to have their head up their own ass. I don't really like the intensely pushy dismissive vibe they have going on, either. How you behave *matters.* \n\nActing like an elitist isn't going to impress anyone- especially when you lack the skill to back it up, which is consistent with people like this. \n\nTbh, I'd prefer the sliced bread.",

            "selftext": "Hello, lovely people. Would like to apologize about my bad English just in advance!\n\nI love roleplaying and roleplaying has always been a fun hobby to me ever since 2005 (when I had discovered it). Even if I would do it on and off, it always stuck with me and it was always one of my favorite creative outlets. However, I can't help but feel some sort of anxiety towards it. I have not roleplayed since September 2018. Tried to do that back in May 2019, a Discord 1x1, with a rping partner I found on /r/Roleplay. I felt like we were connecting to each other, but she ended up ghosting me in less than a week. Just found out that she had also unfriended me a month later. Definitely not angry at her.  If anything, I want to thank her for making me feel excited about rping in the longest time. But since then I can't muster out any excitement for rping. I tried coming back to it on tumblr and only ended up deleting my page 3 days later. And I felt so bad afterwards, like, \"I was actually enjoying writing with those people and they were so kind to me, why I am so harsh on myself!\".\n\nEverything started when I met my long-term rping partner in 2016.  We both roleplayed with each other for nearly 2 years. While it all started out exciting, it became very exhausting. I felt like I lost my freedom and I had to follow someone else creatively. And I was no longer able to share my own ideas or thoughts - and just tend to someone else's needs .My partner would just randomly hit me up saying that he has an idea for this and that. Or he would randomly make up a character on the spot and just post a starter without asking me if I am interested or not. Or even introducing a character that I was going to play in that same starter.\n\nIt started to feel more like a job instead of a hobby to me and it would bum me out. I felt like I am in no spot of telling him 'no' because I didn't want to hurt or offend his feelings. But if anything, this experience taught me is to never be afraid and just say like it is. And I would not be able to take breaks. So, imagine this, posting a reply one after another every single day  without a day off and being anxious to even have a day off because I shouldn't make someone wait.\n\nThe same person also would try to 'fix' my characters. Just in case you are wondering what do I mean by that, it would most likely include face claims. Or if I had a witch character - he was the first person  (and out of any rping partners I've ever had over the whole decade) to tell me that witches can't have any abilities except portal opening, potions making and spells casting. They can't possess any other abilities. And I said that it is not true and that it is roleplaying for a reason. This is why person open to themselves creative-wise and free themselves in that process without thinking what is realistic and what is not, especially in the world of the fantasy. (And no, I was not trying to godmod his characters if that's what you are thinking about. All the talk was about the abilities.)\n\nOf course, he got grumpy and angry about it and told me that I can't make my character that way. And that I should stop looking in to the badly written shows and taking the inspiration from them because they don't serve any purpose.  I kept with my opinion, but he ended it in that kind of a way that said in his own words, \"I'm happy that you see things the way I do\". Which is not true and I never did in the first place, cue, me arguing with him. So, I was forced to grit my teeth and make amends with my rewritten character. This of course upset me a great time and I lost any muse I've had for him. \n\nHe would make mistakes on my characters ALL THE TIME. I once stated that my character works as a receptionist at a law firm, he wrote her as a high school cheerleader. I hated it. I even replied to him asking him to reread our roleplay from the very beginning. He would rewrite the last paragraph in my replies according to his. His excuse was that he was working long hours and that he can't remember everything - but you can always reread the other person's reply!  If you have the time to reply, then you also have the time to read. It goes both ways.\n\nHe even said that if the thread doesn't interest him anymore - he won't reply to it for the longest time, even if it is something that I was excited about and told him many times which certain threads make me happy. But he would always nudge me and ask  me, \"when you are doing replies - can you please do a reply to A or B thread? Thank you\".\n\nHe dehumanized and made fun of my female bisexual character, as if \"ohh you are fucking everything what moves\" from the character's point of a view. Trust me, that was very terrible to me as someone who is bisexual myself, I read that reply and I started crying. I even called him out on that and he said that he didn't say anything wrong, just the truth. \n\nAlso, he had the weirdest obsession with the age gap relationships. He loved older men with the barely legal (or even underage) characters. Another trigger of mine.  I don't want to go into  details about that - but he knew that it is triggering to me and he thought that he should bring it up. And he would occasionally push those threads on me. I can't understand it even today.\n\nHe kept changing one of our first RP couples' backstories and how they both met. I was all okay with us roleplaying from the moment when they both met because I thought that a flashback RP would be very cute to write. But he completely would change everything with every single reply he would do, to the point where I was no longer interested in roleplaying. It was not what we have discussed at all.  \n\nI can tell many more stories. But I don't want anyone to force read through this any longer. \n\nI realize that this was a toxic communication between us. I broke it off. I said that I am taking a hiatus from which I have never come back. Yes, I know what I have done was absolutely bad on my side. I couldn't muster out honesty and that I was no longer enjoying anything what we are writing. I couldn't muster out any excitement in his replies. Yes, one of my breaking points alongside the other things was that I even shared with him my feelings and how I see everything, at least a couple of times.\n\nHe would act like he cares and only to come back to his old habits, I even nicely told him that we have way too many roleplays and I am even thinking about removing some of my characters (because as sad as that sounds, doing their replies would take me a lot of time doing procrastination and just.... no emotions?). And he came back to introducing characters and making them 2 weeks later. \n\nI realized I am not talking to a person capable of any emotions or understanding. I realized I am talking to a wood or someone who is a taker.  And I am glad that I never did come back. I am sure that he was expecting for me to rethink my decision- but I felt so free and independent and that I no longer have to be someone else's maid. I wish for anyone else to never meet a person like this. It is a roller coaster. \n\nBut this story ends in the way where I miss roleplaying. I truly do. But I don't know how to come back to it. I really feel weird anxiety around it whenever I try. Doing replies is very fun to me and  I feel like I have so much creativity still let inside of me where I would like to give a place for my characters - but what can I do? How do I control that anxiety or how I push it away?",

            "selftext": "TW: Brief mentions of abuse, no intense details are given  \nAlso, of course, mentions of smut\n\nSo hello y'all- this is another sort of bad RPer story that took place more recent than my last one- and although I ain't rping with this.... lovely guy really anymore, still kinda is weird and annoying, ya know? Haha, so I guess I'll vent a bit about it.\n\nThis happened over... an app, mostly. Of course I won't say what app, but it's an app used for all different purposes and all different kinds of things, rping is a large part yet only just a part of the communities that are on there. However the app is full of young children and... the rules aren't really enforced too well which is kinda ass so- you got all different kinds of people looking to do some not so very great things, and NSFW content was definitely a big issue and was totally against the rules- but people still did it. I used to rp on here all the time, not so much anymore since I use mostly reddit/discord today, however, before I made the switch it worked fine for me. But of course I got tired of the app after a little while. But when I WAS using this app I met this dude, who I'll call J.\n\nI met J when I was looking for some casual rps, I made a post and all with all my info, and I sent it off into the feed waiting for some responses. It was an hour or so, I'd say, before J had messaged me saying he wanted to rp with me- awesome! Great! I am okay with it. So of course we started discussing-\n\nThe rp we decided on will be a romantic rp. Usually, I don't rp romance rps just because I suck at them, however, I felt pretty good that day, pretty optimistic, so I was actually willing to do one that particular night.\n\nThe rp plot we decided on was going to be a sort of rp where 2 characters were in a relationship in the past- however, had broken up for whatever reason (we chose that my character had cheated on his character). The characters are reunited one rainy night where my character shows up at his character's house with a kid- and is in need of help because they lost their kid's father. This is the basic plot we decided on and okay awesome! Sounds like a cool plot, I'm down- now we started to discuss characters.\n\nI decided to use my character, Daron, because he fitted the plot nicely. I will show Daron's ref real quick just so you know who I was using and get familiar with him-  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Art done by yours truly, ME!](https://preview.redd.it/36ha2i817ki51.jpg?width=1148&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc217509731b0c0999f99c4f1472ab9c814e5c75)\n\nSo this is Daron- one thing to sort of take note of is that he is an intersex person, therefore he is in between sexes, both male and female characteristics for people who aren't familiar with the term. So, in Daron's case, he has XXY chromosomes and he appears to be mostly male, however, has a full female reproductive system (with external differences).\n\nOf course, this shouldn't be anything really considered to be too \"odd\", or seen in a overly-sexualized way but... This dude? The first thing he told me is that he was *really* into it. Which uh- I mean- you have your likes and dislikes but that should've been a red flag since that was the ONLY thing he said about my character. But of course, I am a nice guy so I sort of overlooked it.\n\nJ decided to use his persona, which of course is okay with me because I don't necessarily mind self-inserts or persona-type characters in my rps. Character seemed pretty decent, I had no complaints with him really. Seemed to have a decent backstory, decent personality, decent description- yeah, seemed good to me, I liked his character overall. He however did have to make it known to me that  his character was a little- which okay, know it's not always in a sexual way, lot's of people do it because it's comforting for them and that's totally okay! For J tho? He told me it was a kink or was into it in a sexual way. I'm not into the DD/LG/LB kinda thing just because I don't really get it, and I just ain't personally a fan of sexualizing younger kids, however, If it's between two consenting adults and isn't hurting anyone or being forced on other people, it's whatever to be, I won't kink shame.\n\nI just let J know I wasn't too into it personally, and that it was okay if he was I just wasn't too comfortable with it- and Daron wouldn't really be comfy with it either just because he was sexually abused as a kid. The dude said that's fine, that's whatever, we were all set. Of course I thought it was weird he was only mentioning sexual stuff but also once again I'm nice and don't care. I don't judge. I don't shame. You do you man, as long as it ain't hurting you or anyone else.  \n\n\nSo we start the rp.  \n\n\nstarts off normally, we stick to the plot and all and of course it's full of drama and all. Everything is definitely okay- it was a faster paced, more casual rp like I wanted at the time, I was happy with it. The characters had some pretty intense exchanges and all, the usual- however, as it went on and the characters were warming up to each other- uh... this is when J started to get a bit- horny?? Haha guess that's a good word for it.  \n\n\nNow I don't mind occasional smut in rps- like.... I prefER not to do them at all, or if we do just fade to black, but... he like- went into FULL detail and wanted to write EVERYTHING OUT- okay- fine- I'll go for it butttt I suck at it. So of course there was a sexy scene, it was whatever, I mean I thought it was pretty average and nothing to special. Ya know, J's character calls Daron \"daddy\". Daron isn't too thrilled but he rolls with it because he's go with the flow- and it's whatever  \n\n\nBut then this- take this- and then make it??? The whole ass?? RP?? Like all this dude wanted was to write smut- all the time- literally before they went to bed at night, when they woke up in the morning- when the kid was at school- like- every. single. second. they. weren't. eating. or. sleeping. And of course, it gets very obsessive and annoying because that's all your doing. Like normally, Daron is very lazy, he doesn't wANT to always have sex. He isn't a fan- and of course also, J pushes his kinks onto Daron, onto me, I expressed that I wasn't too comfortable with it. Both sort of during rp, out of rp, I just let him know that I didn't want this to always happen. And of course it still did- and I kinda avoided it as much as possible.  \n\n\nBut when smut wasn't going on, other kinda shitty stuff was happening. Like when they weren't smashing, J's character ALWAYS had to be the main character and ALWAYS had to be the center of attention- like, oh, there was ALWAYS some issue with his character- there was ALWAYS some kind of illness, or some kind of unnecessary edginess- and it also was always like... a pain to rp through? Like nothing NORMAL really happened? Like my character would be eating breakfast and then J would be like   \n\n\n\\*and suddenly he died\\*  \n\n\nLIKE YA KNOW ? Like bro- and it was all the time. The whole rp was either sex or... dying. Like damn dude.   \n\n\nAnd when my character was upset- for whatever reason honestly- J's character was so cold towards Daron like... all the time? Like Daron could be upset for a completely valid reason, and J would be like \"lmao your just overthinking it who cares fuck me\" LIKE NOOOO DUDE- at least I put EFFORT into making YOUR character feel special like my dude isn't an object just to have sex with.  \n\n\nI mean it's just annoying, ya know? Like you put so much effort into your characters and the plot and then the other person takes them and treats em like poopy. Or objectifies them. It's just like man, come on-  \n\n\nSo of course I wanted to sort of cut things off slowly- like, once again I never wanna be rude, so I didn't wanna just be like \"dude what the fuck im done\" ya know? I mean... I had more sort of rps with him, they didn't go on very long at all. like, I used my other character, Serj, once... and he refused to rp with him because he was \"too mentally ill\" for him which makes no sense like my character is only autistic. And his character also had mental illness and it's lowkey hypocritical but- that's probably a story for another time.  \n\n\nOf course, I wanna give people a chance always, but sometimes it's hard because you give them a chance and it's like damn what's even going on? He kinda was a poopy person in general, like I talked to him OOC and he made me feel shitty VERY often- like he wasn't too great so recently I DID actually give up and cut him off completely.   \n\n\nSo I dunno, I mean, I guess it makes for a good story, huh? Hopefully you enjoy. I know it was kinda long but I do gotta bunch of stories to tell and hey, this one was definitely more raunchy than my last. So yeah, hope it wasn't too much of a waste of time, I just wanted to get it all out there haha.  \n\n\nHope yall have a good rest of your days! Or nights!",

Yes the post are Anonymous but if the story is so detailed then it couldn't be hard to find who you're talking about.\n\nB) you're the subject of someone else's post here?

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m new to the group but wanted to rant and maybe get some insight into my dilemmas with roleplaying. To give starting context, I have been rping for about 8-9 years now. It\u2019s always been a place for me to escape when my life has taken terrible turns.\n\nBut lately I\u2019m finding myself just fed up- and it isn\u2019t even because of the process itself, but rather the aggravation that it\u2019s become from others lately. Some reasons I\u2019m getting tired of it:\n\n1. I\u2019ve been bullied for my plots- Now, we all have different tastes. That\u2019s fine. But to insult me, downvote and bully others because YOU don\u2019t like a particular post? It\u2019s just... catty. I work very hard on my plots. You don\u2019t have to like them, but I feel like as long as it\u2019s morally acceptable, we should all respect each other.\n\n2. Not bothering to read my post/rules and just pitching whatever the person wants- I find this one to be disrespectful. You come to me with nothing but vulgar, dirty ideas that have nothing to do with what I posted and then expect me to be on board? Now if that\u2019s your thing, no judgement! But why waste both of our times? \n\n3. Ghosting- Another major pet peeve. I cannot for the life of me understand how you can not simply say you do not feel compatible. Now if the person is aggressive/stalking, sure, but for absolutely no reason? It\u2019s just plain careless. \n\n4. Unreasonable subreddits- Now to start, there are some AMAZING ones with super great admins, but I\u2019ve encountered some lately where the admins have been so rude and on a power trip that it makes me not even want to bother. I broke a rule you formed two hours ago? Okay, sorry, I\u2019m human! Give me a warning and it won\u2019t happen again. \n\nI think I\u2019ve covered most of my points. I just really needed to get this off of my chest, as I\u2019m finding myself giving up on finding partners which is somewhat heartbreaking. I also acknowledge I\u2019m not perfect and definitely need to improve my own personal shortcomings. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day! \u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "So, I get it. I'm not too TOO old, I'm like, Eighteen... Some times about three to two years older than most of the people in this server. Though, as I've been told and heard from many personal friends, and even my SO... I'm a lot more mature than some of the other 18-year-olds they meet. I kinda impart that to the way I was raised, I suppose. So naturally, I try to handle other people maturely. That being said, I do enjoy roleplaying in the Anime Roleplay fandom.....\n\nMost of the time...\n\nRight now I'm in a DRAGON BALL Z roleplay, and 50% of the time I have a lot of fun in those types of groups. However, the other 50% of the time, it's annoying because some of the other roleplayers are just absolute TOOLS. The worst thing is is that... SOME OF THESE PEOPLE are actually good friends of mine... Good friends of mine who completely do 180s' when you join them and actually... you know... roleplay... they do heel turns. Complete and utter heel turns. \n\n***Case one***; Player (named **Brett** for this story) is in the otherworld. This is technically our second go at the server's story. We did a hard reset after the first story kinda derailed and died due to member infighting over how OP someone's character was and how much of a bully they actually were to other members. Brett wasn't involved in that go around, but he was dead the first time go around. He actually didn't have much to DO in the first campaign BECAUSE he was dead. However, now he is dead again. I asked Brett, (who keeps calling me by my character name despite me asking him to call me by MY NAME because he doesn't see why it's disrespectful :/) why he died a second time... and Brett GENUINELY could not answer. He said it was because the villain he was fighting was x2 or x3 amount stronger than him and it was to save another player character...\n\nbut... the server has a rule for PTK, so if you genuinely didn't want to die... then you could've bullshit a way to survive. Sure, the planet's made of metal, but there's no reason for the owner to break his own rule about PTK if you don't want your character to die. He then proceeds to go on about how his event in hell is really good for his development. I then counter with \n\n*\"Well, that's kinda because the owner made* ***NPC's*** *and wrote this event* ***SPECIFICALLY*** *to target those things* ***YOU*** *wanted to be developed. You could've gotten that development in a different more arguably engaging way if you'd done it with other player characters.\"*  \n**Brett**: \"I don't think I would've found it as **interesting** or as **effective**.\"  \n*\"The only reason it's as interesting is because the event is specifically targeted toward you. Nobody is going to have this same experience if they die. If they got the same experience, it wouldn't have been as fun NOR as effective.\"*\n\nMy whole point I was trying to make here was that: Not only could Brett have gotten this development from other PC's in an arguably more natural and humane way, but others could have developed with him through the formation of development. I proceeded to ask how this wouldn't have been as interesting in his opinion:\n\nBrett: *\"I didn't say it wouldn't be* ***interesting****.\"*  \n\"Yes, you literally did.\"  \nBrett: *\"Well, I didn't mean it that way. My brain just says things with words that mean* ***one thing to me*** *but* ***don't mean the same thing to other people****.\"*  \n\"Then why didn't you just explain it the way you meant?\"  \nBrett: *\"I just can't.* ***My brain won't let me****.\"*\n\n**CASE TWO**; The adventures of Gary. Gary and I are doing a fighting thread. We're sparring, and I write an action that has my character turning off my own form of the Kaioken. I write that my character had been using it in short bursts due to its weakness of strain. However, eventually, short bursts will wear me down. I show this by having my character quietly pant. This was written and contextualized in a way that did not mean I was *stunned* or *incapable* of moving. So when Gary starts charging an attack, I start zipping around him really quickly to throw off his senses. Now, Gary is x2 stronger than me... so it was on me for assuming that I could fool his senses. He pointed this out, and I offered to edit in a burst of the kaioken for it to make more sense.\n\nGARY then proceeded to point out that I had said I was winded when I had in fact said I was just quietly panting. He had interpreted it as me needing to catch his breath.  I dismissed this fact but offered to beef up the reply if it would help him ease himself. He then said that he could bring in a staff member to overlook my action and judge if it made sense. I agreed that was okay but still left it open to be changed if it needed to be. \n\nFifteen minutes and no staff member later, he posts. He posted an action that had my character take the blast point-blank range, even though I had been dodging and preparing a counter. He asked me to reply to that however I saw fit, and I said that there was no way for me to survive that attack. I basically lost, and he proceeded to go \"Alright\" and \"Okay.\" I asked him why he hadn't waited for the staff.\n\nGARY said he'd gone into staff chat and had talked to staff PRIVATELY ABOUT THE MATTER. I was, understandably, pretty pissed off about this. He proceeded to say that he was frustrated by my own actions. Queue a discussion with him where I try to get him to understand that if he's confused, too just plot things out with me or ask me to clear up any confusion about actions, and him TELLING ME TO STOP DANCING AROUND MY POINTS, and that he hates plotting and thinks that if people can't play their characters fluidly, they shouldn't be roleplaying. He proceeds to get so aggravated that he demands the conversation be stopped. I say that I'd like it if he could cool down and that I won't be responding until the discussion's finished, as I'd like to get any issues resolved. \n\nHe says I am threatening him.  \nThe owner jumps in and says that I'm holding plot progression hostage.   \nI TL: DR my point and he begrudgingly ends the discussion understanding my point.\n\n**CASE THREE**: The owner wants to change the server's profile picture. I offer to make some pretty nifty graphical gifs for the server, and I post some! Here are a few of the ones I made.   \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gdxzntsqlhh51.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d97n92bplhh51.gif\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the number of gifs I made. In total, I made about 12 or 13 gifs. Some were okay, some were garbage, and some were **PRETTY DECENT**. Like the two above, but some staff member... the CO-OWNER in fact... comes in and says... word for word:  \n\"What did you do to these gifs? Some of them actually ***looked*** good.\"\n\nBuddy. Fuck you. I just wanted to do something nice for this server that treated me like SHIT for the past week and a half. All of the people who I thought were pretty good friends of mine are actually assholes who get triggered when someone tries to contrsutictivly critique their roleplay or tried to encourage outside communication. I just want a decent DBZ roleplay with people who aren't gonna bite my head off for making suggestions or comments or trying to be cooperative or considerate.\n\n And I did try to give Brett some alternative scenarios that he could've done with other PC's that could've given him what he got from hell in an actual dramatic and stylish way. He said that'd of been boring. I said, \"I ***disagree***, but that's okay.\" But no, he still got angry anyways.\n\nWhen's life gonna give me a good DBZ server...  \nOr metal gear...  \nMetal Gear would be nice.",

I only messaged them twice on one account awhile back and in their profile rules they said its ok to double message sometimes if you haven't heard back from me in awhile. They reblogged though today from someone else in the fandom I know though. Has anyone else been randomly blocked by a roleplayer?

            "selftext": "I've been rping for a good decade now and I've had my fair share of rp horror stories. I've be ghosted and I've ghosted. I'm not proud of it but I have. I've had partners not understand what I'm trying to get across even if I explain it in various ways and I've had a hard time understanding what my partners are trying to get across. I've had bad rp partners and I've been a bad rp partner. No one is perfect. And I get that. But somethings that happen just end up frustrating me so damn much. And this is one of those examples.\n\nI started an rp with this person through discord, lets call them X, a few weeks ago. My character for this roleplay is decently in depth and complex. She requires a certain type of character to play off of her at least at the beginning. She is set up to change later on. But you can't interact with her in a playful manner right off the bat. She's a fairly serious character starting off and won't hesitate to end you if you cross her the wrong way. And it felt like how X was playing their character was setting up to get them on the wrong end of her sword. So I asked them if they could please edit their post, for this reason and because I didn't know how to work with what I was given. I needed a little bit more. I would have been open to hearing what they had to say if they wanted to defend their characters actions. Maybe they had a plan that I didn't know of, that kind of thing.\n\nI usually wait a week before messaging someone again if I haven't heard from them but sometimes discord likes to be a pain and doesn't tell me when someone messages me for whatever reason. Or I'll open a message when I'm half asleep to get rid of the notification and then forget about it. So I went to check the server and X had left it. A few things ran in my mind but one I came back to was 'okay, this has happened before. I've had someone accidentally leave a server when they were going through old ones. Maybe they left by accident'. So I checked to see if they were still friends with me and they were. So I sent them another message asking if this was the case. I check back again not long after and what do you know? They deleted me. No word. No 'I'm sorry but I lost interest' or 'I can't rp with you anymore'. Just gone. Without a word.\n\nI wouldn't be as irritated as I am if they had just come out and said they had an issue with me. I know how I can get with this character. Sometimes I don't notice it right away. But they said nothing. They said nothing and just left like it was nothing. This isn't the first time something like this has happened and it probably won't be the last. I just really wish people would communicate when there's an issue, be it with me or with something in the roleplay.",

Cause it's really frustrating.\n\nSo if there's anyone who really understand this server can you explain what's considered a \"hub\" or \"collection\" server? Cause both my most recent ad as and my friend's ad have been taken down for being hubs.\n\nI sent a message about this to the mods For clarification. They responded with basically it's any server that had things out of it that's not rp, voice chat, dice roles things like that.\n\nIf I'm honest...I don't like that. It seems like a blanket statement.\n\nFirst off, in both servers we tried to advertise we do have a rolling system for the rp. We use Tatsu Bot and it's for our combat and decision making in the rp. For things related to the rp. \n\nSecond. Neither of us have used dice rolling or VC in either of our ads. So unless they had someone join and check it out they wouldn't know. Or someone told? But I really doubt someone would be that petty about it.\n\nLike it just seems very dumb and I wished this was told in the rules or when you got your as taken down. Instead of just repeating the rule, explain and elaborate. It's much more helpful.\n\nI was also told on the last post that there's a list of words banned. For example, hell. So you can't say hello. I understand having a list of banned words, kinda, you want SFW ads, but if that's true then why don't you tell anyone about it and not just keep it to yourself? \n\nThere's like zero actual communion between the mods and the members. Except when the ad is taken down. There really needs to be more clarity in the rules, the explanation in why the ad was taken down, and if not that a new subreddit that can take this one's place.",

            "selftext": "In about 2011, I got into roleplaying for the first time. I was ten years old and *really* into Warrior Cats. It was an absolute obsession. I used the family computer to find the old HarperCollins forums that were dedicated to the series, and wound up discovering the world of written roleplay. It was magical. I was probably a lot of people's experience with bad RPers - I was literally ten. But I got the hang of it pretty quick, with a couple of pointers from other friendly folks. \n\nAnd while my love for the Warriors books faded, my time on the forums lasted well into my teens. I saw some shit, guys. Some real hinky shit. Mary-Sues were abundant, there were all-out \"kit-stealing\" wars, (Looking back on this... hey. Why did so many people violently steal each other's imaginary infants?) sometimes evildoers would post gore or porn and it would be the talk of the whole site for a couple days.\n\nKeep in mind, the majority of participants on this website were at average... maybe 13.\n\nIt was in 2015 that I met the focus of this story. We'll call him Mason, not his real name. I had what was called a \"den\", which was Warriors lingo for my own chatroom. I'd have friends from around the world shooting the shit at all hours of the day. One of these people was Mason. I later discovered he was around 17 at the time - I was 14. He was friendly and relatively popular, because anyone who claimed to be a guy on these forums got a lot of attention. They were a rare breed.\n\nWe hit it off, and he started joining the 1x1 threads I'd post. I remember one involving vampires. He confided in me that he didn't really want to participate in this plot because he didn't like playing against male characters, but went ahead and did so because we were friends.\n\nOne day, he started his own 1x1 thread. The concept was this: he would play a peasant in a small medieval kingdom, and his partner would play a princess. Totally normal, everyday stuff. The kicker was, something would happen to the princess on her coronation day that turned her, beauty and the beast style, into a giantess. We're talking *huge* lady. \n\nI was not interested in this plot. I, for reasons then unknown to me, only played men. (Hello, undiagnosed gender dysphoria.) And something about the concept was just... weird to me. Then comes Mason, chatting in my den as per usual, and he says to me, \"I did your vampire plot despite not really wanting to, because we're friends. So could you pay me back and do my giantess plot?\"\n\n(I'm paraphrasing, mostly because my den and my RPs and that whole long period of my life has been lost - the HarperCollins Warrior Cats forums no longer exist.)\n\nAnd I relented. The first thing his character did when my poor princess turned giant? He climbed into the folds of her feet, and just sorta... hung out there. Cue plenty of descriptions of the smell and feel of her massive fucking feet, and how helpless he was, and how big and powerful she seemed.\n\nNow you might be thinking... I know what that's about. And that's because you absolutely do. Mason, he later told me, had both a foot fetish, and a shrinking fetish, and considered himself a submissive. He liked the idea of being very small, and hanging around ladies' big dangerous feet. \n\nThis near-adult guilt-tripped a 14-year-old into fulfilling his foot fantasy. In hindsight: ew. I remember being uncomfortable with it, but by this point we were close friends. He'd confide in me about his girl problems and his mental health issues and I'd listen and commiserate. It was a really bad situation. \n\nEventually, a change in lifestyle for both of us meant that we lost contact. I have since learned more about the world, and my own limitations, and would never put myself in that position again. But the fact of the matter is that at 17, he should have known better. Especially on a children's forum about religious cats.",

I've been role-playing for eight years now and I have met some of the most amazing, fantastic and down to earth people through this hobby.\n\nYes, I've had my fair share of dick heads, perverts, rude fucks, guilt trippers, manipulators, self-absorbed arrogant pricks, catfish, pathological liars and just down right fucking strange creeps who confuse reality with fantasy. I've experienced and seen it all.\u00a0\n\nAnd yes, I have seriously considered giving up this hobby because of those people who have presented very toxic and abusive behaviour. Behaviour so bizarre that I have literally been left behind gobsmacked. Seriously, have you ever thought to yourself: \"What. The. Fuck?\" - \"Is this prick for real?\" - \"Is this really happening to me right now?\" -\u00a0 \"Are they seriously still doing this after I've specifically said to them that I'm not comfortable with it!?\" - \"The audacity of this bitch!\"\u00a0\n\nI mean come on, we've all been there. We've all had these thoughts about our role-play partners. We've all had these similar experiences. Like everything in life, you take the bad with the good.\u00a0\n\nMy attitude now? I ghost and block your ass on all platforms as soon as you present toxic, abusive, manipulative or narcissistic behaviour. I'm not here for it and you best be assured that whenever it comes to me you'll be put back in your place. I ain't here to take your bullshit and I won't entertain it either. Respect me and my time and I'll respect you and your time. Otherwise, to me at least, you don't exist.\u00a0\n\nMoving on\u2026\n\nI don't need your friendship to be invested in the storyline. I don't need your friendship for the momentum of the plot. I don't need your friendship for the development of our characters or the progress of their relationship. I don't need your friendship to enjoy our role-play or to be a good writer. I don't need your friendship to be a good and decent role-play partner.\u00a0\n\nI don't need your friendship to role-play.\u00a0\n\nAll I need is your time, your commitment, your investment and your open and honest communication. I also need you to collaborate with me. I need you to put in the same effort I do. I need you to be a team player and to be willing to solve any problems we may run into in or out of character.\n\nMost importantly of all, I need you to understand that we won't always be on the same page because we have different expectations, we have creative differences and we're two entirely different people and that's ok. Not only is it ok but it is to be expected so to keep things fair and to have a neutral playing field we're going to have to compromise with each other at times. I can't always have it my way and you can't always have it your way.\n\nThat's what I need from you to enjoy our role-play. I don't need to know you on a personal level. We don't have to be friends. We don't owe each other anything.\u00a0\n\nI came here to role-play and that's what my intentions are, to role-play. That's the only thing I'm here for.\u00a0\n\nI'm not against us being acquainted with each other, engaging in small talk for the sake of pleasantries or even being on friendly terms but I'm not going to enforce any kind of relationship with you just because you deem it necessary.\u00a0\n\nIf we gel, we gel. If we don't, then we don't. It's as simple as that. I'm not going to enforce anything for the sake of it or because the other party demands it. That's not how the real world works. That's not how relationships work. You can't demand my friendship just because you say you won't enjoy the role-play, be invested in the storyline or be able to write at your best.\u00a0\n\nNo. No, no, and no.\u00a0\n\nYou are just someone I role-play with. You are my role-play partner. That's all there is to it. Nothing more and nothing less. If you can't respect that then leave. Go and role-play with someone else. I came here to role-play, not to make friends. If I wanted friends I would advertise myself on subreddit that was dictated to finding and making friends.\u00a0\n\nYou are not entitled to anything. I don't owe you an explanation, my friendship or even my time. The same way I am not entitled to an explanation, your time or your friendship.\u00a0\n\nAnd don't take this personally because it's not personal. This has nothing to do with you. I just want to role-play. Obviously, if we click and our friendship happens naturally then I'm all for it. Otherwise I'm just here to role-play.",
