            "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I am typing this at 4am, and my memory isn't the best and I am not in the server at this point, so some information may be slightly incorrect or missing.   \n\n\nTo start off; I joined in December of 2017, essentially becoming part of a long term D&amp;D-lite multifandom roleplay server on Discord. There were over a dozen of us basically going along with a plot multiple DMs were collaborating on, with the whole thing running pretty smoothly until a few of the DMs dropped out and that roleplay pattered to a stop. We restarted twice and did different plots, both dying out after a few months.  \n\n\nThe actual issues didn't fully crop up until we decided to start a new roleplay in August or September of 2019. Our coder had left sometime before this, as did a small amount of the older members, and the newly appointed head DM was completely new to managing any kind of server or roleplay that large. Of course I completely understand how that sort of position can be extremely overwhelming, though part of me does think it would have been for the best if this DM did not attempt to do things on their own for the most part, and did not bite off more than they can chew.  \n\n\nBut alright. So, the first few months seemed to go decently smooth, albeit the DM continuously invited new people into the server that would post a handful of times before completely ceasing to participate in discussion or roleplay, though I can't exactly blame them. There was also the issue of people getting into full blown arguments, which is still something that commonly occurs due to people being stubborn with specific things or lacking communication, and the DM getting upset or completely shutting down with any piece of criticism.   \n\n\nSo the roleplay continued, though we do lack any form of combat system outside of an optional 2d6, as well as our crafting system being nearly forgotten about, and the currency having essentially been ignored after a few months. The majority of plots have essentially come to a standstill due to waiting on specific people to participate, and we have been waiting since October or November of 2019 to actually continue with the \"\"main\"\" plotline, in which a rival group was supposed to attack the main group. From what I'm aware of, this still has not occurred.  \n\n\nMinor plotlines have also popped up, with a handful have been created by other members of the server, though the head DM is the one mainly doing all of that. It... is kind of tiring, however, mainly due to the fact essentially all of them revolve around Transformers, Kamen Rider, or the DM's non-NPC characters in some form, though it's not a major issue compared to everything else.  \n\n\nBut as the roleplay continued, less and less people continued to participate, and it's gotten to the point where approximately 4 people typically the most amount one will see actively roleplaying every week of the 20+ members in the server. I myself left in June due to mental health issues, as well as becoming extremely distant with the roleplay overall and a handful of people in the server after I expressed discomfort with one of the DM's characters and their overall handling of the situation back in January.   \n\n\nFrom what my friend has told me, the roleplay is still going, and... I'm not really sure what to do? On one hand, I want to rejoin, participate, and restructure things so it's more manageable, and on the other, it may be best to completely cut ties despite having participated in the server for as long as I did.   \n\n\nIs it worth trying to intervene and restart with a new plot that may or may not pique interest of those that have ceased roleplaying? Or is it completely useless to attempt any sort of new roleplay session due to the DM being unable to take the smallest amount of criticism without becoming upset. Any input would be dearly appreciated, and thank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "It was but a regular day of searching for servers, ones of the mythical city setting with open-ended plots and many characters. This is the story that could not happen anywhere else, other than *\"The Little Server of Horrors\"* ***\\*DRAMATIC MUSIC\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrologue: **\"The Story of the Littlest Roleplayer That Could\"**\n\nThe Little Server of Horrors came across as a normal roleplaying server where the majority used IRL faceclaims. I personally do not like IRL faceclaims, since I'd not enjoy if someone theoretically found me on TikTok or Instagram and said: \"I will make them fuck someone.\"\n\nAs far as I remember, I never voiced my opinion regarding that in the server. But it did not take long for me to feel unwelcome when a member repeatedly commented how he hated anime faceclaims. I prefer drawn faceclaims since it helps me disconnect from, shall we say, reality. I also source my claims, while believing that they're far more expressive than a model blankly gazing into the camera or distance. My first day in the server had already been far from decent, eventually I tried to stay no matter what. I just wanted to find a new partner since some of the RPers also wrote at a level similar to my own. In truth, I only had one successful play out of perhaps five. One out of five did not result in me being ghosted or ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart One: **\"The Gayist\"**\n\nA scene that started decently, yet quickly degenerated into a cesspit of misunderstandings. In the end I got aggressive due to this random person's hubris or complex. For context beforehand, his character asked if mine had prepared himself for sex. I am actually familiar with gay sex, yet my insecurities from this actually resulted in me contacting some friends with more experience. Shockingly enough, they had no idea what the fuck he wanted from me. The post speaks for itself, since all I stated in my response before was that my boy brought lube. I wanted to comment that there are many other ways to have sex than just penetration, but I refused to. I actually appreciate foreplay or details like this, but The Gayist was a special case.\n\n(The Gayist is white-ish, I am pink.)\n\n[Really awkward, it was my first roleplay there. I thought our two characters had some chemistry. Yet while our characters had chemistry, we did not. The icing on the cake is the fact that an admin told me to verify my age when we started talking about this. The warning signs in my head told me that this 'random' verification system was not as random as claimed. But I could've been wrong. After scrambling for my ID, taking a picture and blotting out everything required, I was back into the play. Hence the skip of almost two hours.  My character is also thirty years old with plenty of experience, why this player would have doubts OOC if he can clean his shitter properly is beyond my understanding.](https://preview.redd.it/h616xxo305j51.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f9f01959edd6e12e77cbf0f87c8dcf08f30b481)\n\nPart Two: **\"The Troublist\"**\n\nAfter another failed roleplay where the partner left the server while I was sleeping, I decided to write a new character for the server. One of the server's many problems in my eyes, was that the amount of characters one could have was based on a leveling system. The higher your level, the more. It was already hard enough to find partners for me, so my strategy was to ***literally powergame*** in the general chat to write a new boy. This boy was a childish son of a mob boss, who could barely be considered close to his mental age of 19 thanks to his severe narcissism &amp; tantrums. I like characters who are clearly flawed or immature, almost humorous in a dark way. The new roleplayer I found can be considered a Tiny Bad, with a mix of the hero I needed. Let us call him \"The Troublist.\" His character was a regular man who my mafia bean took interest in. Everything worked smoothly, since we were both able to characterise our PCs through the interaction. His character left abruptly, naturally I suspected I had done something wrong. So I DM'd him after desiring more communication after the past two or so failed plots. The player told me he had IRL issues that was bleeding into the roleplay. While I appreciated him *actually* communicating with me, I'd also appreciate if he could've told me this beforehand. Or just have us put the play on hold rather than suddenly stopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart Three: **\"The Lawyerist\"**\n\nI did not want the humble Troublist, and with context the nicest member in the server, stop me from continuing my quest of starting The Play\u2122 with someone. I decided to answer someone's request. His character owned a law firm, while my newest one was but a humble male escort (I know not all escorts do sex) with a skillful tongue. Naturally I could see them have some chemistry considering how many sex workers, or escorts, could desire legal protection. However, The Lawyerist wanted nothing to do with that.\n\n(I am pink, The Lawyerist is yellow.)\n\n[In hindsight, I should've worded my thoughts better \\(god\\). But The Lawyerist puzzled me since his act &amp; reasoning came across as homophobic. Even today, it is one of the Littlest Server of Horrors' many unsolved mysteries.](https://preview.redd.it/cgtto4mv45j51.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=550942f313dedfa0e58d28325467467771b9232a)\n\nPart Three: **\"The Unequalist\"**\n\nAdmins and moderators should be the ones to represent a server, yet some do such a terrible job at it. To make up for the strict, awkward leveling system, one could nitro boost to gain additional perks. Having a fresh boost from a past server, I decided to do just that. With that, I made three new characters in what felt like a light state of hypomania. Yet, The Unequalist said I was making too many characters that \"I am not going to use.\"\n\n[It turns out that some roleplayers are more equal than others, and that I am just not one of them. The Unequalist did not win this fight, for another admin intervened. However, they also stated that I should not make any more characters \\\\\"unless I get to use them\\\\\". I stated that my intention was to have a small roster of boys that can fit into more player plots. I recall having five characters in total. Awkward.](https://preview.redd.it/xlq6sc9865j51.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3994173b3a8017b6a65744f8d08cbcd83805477)\n\nEpilogue: **\"The Thought Final\"**  \n\n\nOnce more the looming feeling that I was hated or disliked creeped forward. After all, unlimited is unlimited. They could've changed those rules to still have a limit, since it's impossible for someone to play an 'unlimited' amount of characters and use them all equally. \n\nA warning sign was that people would post roleplaying requests, only for others to request under them not even an hour later. Creating many pings, and most just not seeking out other players to, well, roleplay. I never commented on this rudeness, but felt I should have. Chances are I'd just get in trouble with The Unequalist again for pointing it out. \n\nAfter weeks of bad luck, I finally left the server. \n\nLike a Dark Souls NPC, I went hollow.",

            "selftext": "[Warning: Mentions of suicide]\nI need to get this of my chest now cause this has made me so mad I can't function right now. This is all that's on my mind.\n\nSo I'd say a few weeks ago. Maybe a month a new person entered an rp server I run. We'll call her Tina. At first things were fine. Well okay. I had a few problems with her character but those were quickly removed. Her as an Rper was fine. Her as a person though....\n\nThings got bad at her first mention of suicide.\n\nShe said she was going to jump into a pool since she didn't know how to swim. Naturally this scared me and worried me a lot. So I sent her a DM so we could talk. I did the best I could. Telling her that everything would be okay. Tina went silent and it scared me a lot. I thought she may have done it. The relief when she started texting back was great.\n\nAfter the first scaren we'd try for a bit. Mostly me just encouraging her she her doing the same when I  was down. This was when red flags started popping up. At random times she'd just send a DM saying *hugs and kisses you*. I'll admit this is somewhat my fault as I never told her to stop it or that I was uncomfortable. Tina seems very sensitive to bad reactions and I was always worried about that. \n\nThen she told me she liked me. Which was very weird to me. However this time I did say I wanted to just stay friends. However this was really when, for me, the red flags for bigger. This same server is one I run with two others and I told them what Tina said. Apparently Tina said the same to her and she actually said yes. But quickly ended it when things got toxic. So I'm not the first one she went to. So the her admitting she liked me happened yesterday as of writing this. Here's what happened today.\n\nSo she started with a hello good morning. That was fine. Oh one more thing about yesterday. She asked if I wanted to canoodle. I didn't answer in hope Tina would forget. She didn't she asked me again. Again I ignored. Then this took a bad turn when she said this:\n\n\"Been thinking about you all day\"\n\nThat was a line too far and I asked my friend if she would tell Tina not to talk to me again. I didn't do it myself because I always remembered her first suicide scare, and it wasn't her only one. I didn't want to be the cause of her doing that to herself. Thinking back on it I do realize what I did was cowardice. I'm not proud to admit but it was. I should've said it myself instead of outsourcing and I should've said that what she was doing was making me uncomfortable. \n\nLater she left the server, leaving by saying \"I'm sorry\" in the general text. Now she was a good Rper unfortunately so a few wanted her backc Some others tried to talk to her and apparently she thought we hated her. That's when things came to light. My friend and I weren't the only ones she's flirted with. She did it with at least 2 others on the server. One at the beginning of August.\n\nHere's why I'm mad: Tina to me seems like an emotionally manipulative person. She knows she'll keep people around because she knows they don't want a suicide on their conscience. Now I'm not a therapist and I'm not in Tina's head. So this is all just from my belief. But I do think the girl needs some serious help. \n\nShe actually came back to the server after everything. Things have been quiet currently. I don't know what's going to happen next but I hope she learns.",

            "selftext": "Okay! So, I recently found a partner on r/roleplay. It's for a fandom we're both SUPER into and their plot got me so excited and had so much potential, I had pitched it as a D&amp;D campaign for some friends. So, naturally, I was VERY EXCITED. When they reached out, I had been very VERY excited about the plot. I pitched my own ideas, made my own contributions, offered to pick up a ton of NPC's to give the story plenty of antagonists to cause drama and chaos and engagement. \n\nThey seemed super into it!\n\nAfter the first day, we talked and met, after a LOT of stuff was submitted and talked about, it was decided that we'd wait before plotting the beginning of the roleplay. So I've been waiting for them to finish submitting all their characters and stuff, but I've gotten radio silence. Granted, they said they were busy Friday - Saturday and that they'd do stuff Sunday. Well, Sunday is here, and I've still got radio silence. However, I understand if things come up. It's natural.  \n\nHere's what's confusing me:\n\nThey keep reposting the ad for the roleplay. I'm thinking to myself, \"Hey! Maybe they wanna turn it into a group roleplay. I'm cool with that!\", so I put that in the discord server. However, I go to check out the ad and it's expressly stating that it's a One on One thing. I'm really confused! I brought it up a few minutes ago, and I'm still getting radio silence... but if they don't want to roleplay with me, why don't they tell me?\n\nShould I do something different? Should I leave? I'm super confused. I get that people want to sometimes do the same plot with different people for different takes, but we haven't even started the plot yet and it already feels like they wanna move onto a different partner.",

            "selftext": "I'm posting this on my alt to avoid anyone else seeing this hence the lack of post history.\n\nFor the longest time I've been looking for an RP partner like I had a bit ago.\n\nA bit of backstory: **I posted a prompt that usually generates a lot buzz back in November of last year. I got a bunch of responses and I start sorting them out. I find one person and instantly they start checking off boxes - Is fun to talk to OOCly? Check. Their character has a great and interesting backstory? Check. They are actually plotting with me? Double check. And they seem actually interested in the story? Check.**\n\n**We get to RPing and write out this slow burn romance for the next three months. It ended up not working out, but man was that RP fun to write. It was refreshing to finally see someone who took care in the story, character development, and took pleasure in writing.**\n\nCut to recently: **I go and post the same prompt. This time oddly, I don't generate nearly enough responses, which is fine. The responses I do get - Their message suggests they are really interested in the prompt, but when they get added on discord, I get nothing but lazy character development. Instead of plotting some of story out and trying to figure out character archs or backstory, I get people who just want to jump into the RP.**\n\nDude, I love to plot and discuss characters. I'm all about that life, but it just pulls all the wind out of my sails when people act all excited about the prompt, but seem to pull a half measure on their character. I want archs, I want development, and I want backstory. I know it's my prompt, but we are writing it together. You're entitled to half of the story as much as I am, so act like it. Get involved, throw out ideas, build off of mine, and most importantly: have fun with it.\n\nI don't know what happened, but it is extremely disheartening when I present this character who I've had for years and who I want to expand upon only to just get thrown this cardboard character. It isn't fun, it isn't exciting, and it isn't original. Shit, I will even help you as much as I can, but you need to help me help you. Fucking a man.",

            "selftext": "So you know when you're in the beginning stages of discussion, feeling each other out and seeing if you're both able to meet each other's expectations and needs? Generally, I've developed a sense of how likely we'll mesh within probably the first 10 messages we exchange as we discuss our preferences and ideas. \n\nIf someone isn't receptive to ideas, nor suggesting their own, I figure they're not going to be a partner who lasts very long.\n\nBut more annoying, are the partners who badger you after a few minutes of not getting back to them. I think using reddit chat, makes some very impatient. Typically I'm likely doing other things and can't always get back to someone ASAP or I'm messaging someone before I go to work or to bed. So sometimes it's several hours before I get back to them. And if they're reply to me wasn't that great (low-effort reply to our discussion for instance) then I'm going to get to it later after I have had time to consider a response.\n\nI hate when a potential partner \"pokes\" me or suddenly accuses me of not being interested in the span of five minutes. Seriously, that's such a turn-off as a human being for you to project insecurities onto someone you don't even know. I'm not here to coddle my partners. I respect when people have lives outside of their online hobbies. \n\nI get prodding someone if it's been a few days but even just a few minutes/hours? That's really cringe and it pisses me off because it feels manipulative. \n\nIt makes me instantly not want to talk/plot with someone because it feels like they don't respect me as a person.\n\nThere are times where I have to explicitly tell people up front that I won't always be online or won't always have a rapid reply (posting or plotting) but I shouldn't have to do that. I shouldn't have to explain my life to someone else without being accused of ghosting or changing my mind. It's so annoying!",

            "selftext": "This story is marked as NSFW due to what it mentions, fair trigger warning for some mentions of sexual trauma and suicide baiting. My Grammar might be bad sometimes due to the rage writing this brings me, this person made me genuinely upset. Thankfully they have no way of contacting me now and I have a beautiful girlfriend who actually cares about me, my feelings and my health and does not disregard it for her own pleasures like this person did. These are just some of the things that have happened by the way, there is many more and even a album of screenshots that I had and I think I still do have that document way more.\n\nAround late 2019 (him and I started dating in October) I had this boyfriend who was my age (fourteen) who we will call M. M would make me do these five nights at Freddy's smut roleplays that were really awful, he made me to them a lot. At first I was not that annoyed but it became a almost every day. Eventually one day I said no and at first he was fine with it, but then he started saying he would kill himself if we did not continue. \n\nI was a bit scared, I was recovering from suicidal thoughts and at first I believed him so I begged him not to and that I would roleplay with him, he seemed happy after I said yes and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nUntil his suicide baiting became a normal occurrence every time I said no to something.\n\nHe did not support one of my main coping mechanisms which is selfshipping (self insert x Canon basically) and whenever I talked about it, even to someone else, he began to suicide bait-spam me which brings us to his next red flag.\n\nOne day I was having really bad flashbacks (I am a rape survivor.) and I told him I would not be able to roleplay due to this, he was fine with this until he saw me talking about selfshipping to my friend who knew and respected that it is my coping mechanism and knew that talking about it made me feel better.\n\nM did not like this and began to text me, saying that I am probably thinking about having sex with my fictional crushes.\n\nThis made me upset because I told him I would not be able to handle talking about anything sexual that day, I got super pissed and told him we need to talk about this problem. Instead of listening he astericks role played shooting himself. I was fucking livid and still am. This is when I realized he was an attention whore. - and also a hypocrite, because while he hated my selfships with a burning passion he also would spam me with hentai of fictional crushes he wanted to fuck even if it made me uncomfortable.\n\nM was also horny all the fucking time and expected me to be too even if I was uncomfortable. He tried to make me send side boob pictures once. (I have never sent him any pictures thankfully). He would talk a ton of sexual shit to the point I had to mute his DMs due to my mom and niece almost seeing that on Thanksgiving, even when I told him to stop, which made him angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon his suicide baiting and asterisks roleplaying his own suicide became a daily thing, which caused me to have a stress induced panic attack at school a few weeks before Christmas. My friends were even tired of him too, M was highly rude to my friends and would never respect them, especially the ones who knew me before him to the point he would threaten them and would whine and bitch to me about how I should ditch them.\n\nWe broke up a week before Christmas thankfully, which caused him to spam me with insults like 'whore' and 'slut' saying that I'm gonna go back to one of my exes. He kept threatening to block me too but I was the one who had to block him. During that he also astericks roleplayed killing me. Wow.\n\nI'm glad to say that I have not seen him since, he has stayed in my blocked list where he will stay for eternity.",

I've definetley improved from where I started. Outside of roleplay I've always loved writing, poetry, etc. Of course I am not perfect but I am a decent Semi-Literate to Literate writer.\n\nWith this being said, it's extremely hard to find roleplay partners.\n\nFor starters, because I am under the age of 18, other roleplayers often automatically assume I'm an inexperienced or unable roleplayer. This can be frustrating when in reality I am a very adequate roleplayer.\n\nSecondly, finding other decent roleplayers in my age range can be quite tiring. I say this because many other roleplayers in my age range aren't able to match my standards and things like that. Finding semi-literate, grammar efficient roleplayers in my age range can be difficult. I try to always give people a chance but many of the 13-17 year old roleplayers I've roleplayed with are only able to write things like:\n\n\" *smiles and waves* \"\n\n\n\nThis was just a small rant/vent of being a young roleplayer and attempting to find 13-19 year old roleplay partners.",

I left them because of consistently toxic behavior from them which sort of ruined my experience in the fandom, but I also realized just how... bad they were at portraying characters.\n\nSo our thing was that we'd roleplay as canon characters, and in this fandom, there were different \"eras\". There was a certain era that isn't as well known since it didn't get the same exposure as the other eras if that makes sense, but it was my favorite and I put a lot of time into consuming that era's canon and even primarily roleplaying as that era's characters. And because of that, everyone decided to roleplay that era too...\n\nBut most of them didn't know the era as well, so their interpretations were off. And unfortunately, the wiki for this fandom wasn't a well constructed one, so when one person decided to portray this one character as a shy person because the wiki had nothing on their personality (which was practically his entire personality), despite his in-game dialogue making him out to be confident, if not a bit sassy, it... got on my nerves kinda. Like, if the wiki didn't say anything, they could've just asked someone who knew the character on how to portray them instead of this one stereotype from the assumption of his backstory that isn't them at all. Or just don't roleplay the character at all if you really don't know them enough or care enough to do proper research.\n\nIdk I'm just saying, it's fun to branch out and try different characters but maybe do some good research to nail them",

            "selftext": "Hello, so I've been roleplaying since 2012. I mainly do so on Facebook, Amino, Roleplay . me and such. I've been an admin in groups before, ran my own groups with 30+ people, and I would consider myself detailed with 4+ lines for a starter. Over my time, I have had more good experiences than bad but there is a few that stick out.\n\nWhen I roleplay I always have a few rules.\n\n* Be 18+\n* Replies must be 3-4 lines minimum\n* Understand I have a life outside of roleplay and take breaks\n\nSo one day a guy messages me (Lets call him Chad)\n\nChad had messaged me for roleplays multiple times because we were in a few of the same roleplay groups. Chad tended to do 3-5 word replies when I would send 8+ sentence replies. I had told him multiple times I don't do illiterate roleplays which he wouldn't understand. Here's an example of one of our conversations\n\nMe: Hey Chad, I would like for 3-4 sentences replies please. My replies are 6 to 8 lines so it'd be nice to have longer replies from you. Thanks for understanding.\n\nChad: I don't have time to send long replies :/ I have a life and a girlfriend you know \n\nMe: I understand that, we have different styles so I will have to respectfully end this roleplay.\n\nChad: But I want to rp with you! Why are you being selfish?! You B\\*\\*ch! My grandmother just died and you're gonna end our rp? You F\\*\\*\\*ing C\\*nt\n\nMe: Ok?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see what kind of guy he is now. Here's an example of my replies vs his\n\nMe: Jasmine sighs softly, listening to her teacher drone on about calculus. Her red hair was tied in a low bun and her eyes were locked on the clock. \u2018Any minute now he will come in.\u2019 She thinks to herself, tapping her pencil against her cheek. The \u2018Creeeeak\u2019 of the ugly blue door well overdue for being oiled caught her attention as (Y/C) walks through the door. Her face forms an expression of shock as a blush forms on her ivory cheeks. \u2018Whatever god there is just had to make the man who should be my enemy so *appealing!*\u201d\n\nChad: Adam walks in and sees a beautiful girl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the course of the months I dealt with Chad I got to the point I would start to leave him on seen. Out of the many people I have roleplayed with, he was one of the very few who didn't understand my 3 rules. Not the most dramatic story but eh.",

            "selftext": "This happened to me just a few days ago and it's one of the more... say, interesting, encounters I've had in roleplay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this guy comes into my server and immediately begins the good old \"testing the lore\" by asking critical questions about the big baddies in my setting. It's fine to be critical of lore, I'm critical of my own lore as well because I know these kind of people are out there and I'd rather have a solid setting than have to explains things with \"I don't know.\" BUT, the way that this guy was being critical wasn't in a constructive manner, it was rather in a, \"Let me see where the admins have holes in their own setting so I can exploit that.\" kind of way.\n\nHow did he want to exploit it? He wanted to basically wipe out my canon groups because he wanted to make a character as evil and bad as a video game's main villain. This became even more evident when he showed us his application and there was no depth at all to his character other than, \"He's sooo EVUUULL and he HATES people, reee, so edgy, so evil!!\" I pointed this out and told him that he needed a reason for these things to which he answered, \"Well I don't want to write a background story because that humanizes a character that has lost his humanity.\" Buddy. Even EVIL edgelords needs some depth and even they need to have some sense of humanity and reason for their actions. Otherwise, you're not playing a character, you're playing an object. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that really got to me was how this guy kept trying to explain how his character would exploit my big baddies to wipe out my groups. I kept asking him critical questions like, \"How would they do that, when this makes it impossible?\" and he kept coming up with new crazy ideas that wouldn't work. Eventually he spilled why he was trying SO HARD to make his idea happen and basically said, \"I want to play the protagonist for once and admins on these servers always seem so unwilling to change!\" So, you want come into this roleplay, wipe out my canon groups that hold this whole thing together, exploit the big baddies of my roleplay in ways that you can't because it goes against the lore, and you're calling me a bad admin for not letting you do this? My guy, it's not about unwillingness to change, it's about you coming into a story that is not yours and wanting to change everything about it. This particular setting is dear to me because I've worked on it for years so you just want me to let you, a person I don't know, fuck over everything with your terrible ideas? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kinda get why these edgelords think that their character being so ridicules makes them the protagonist of the story, but the thing is, there is no protagonist in roleplay. Everyone see their own characters as the protagonist, no one is more important than others. This guy clearly just wanted to play out his own power tripping fetish and should probably have stuck to just writing a book or making his own server. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo remember guys, next time you encounter one of these edgelords, they just want to be the protagonist of your roleplay and you're just unwilling to allow change.",
