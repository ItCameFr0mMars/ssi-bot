            "selftext": "This is not news to most women around here, but may be to the fellas. Most of the male players around here (let's call it RP Land a union of Reddit, various forums, and services like Discord) don't exactly rise to the status of \"elite\" or even close to \"advanced.\" Most of those, almost to the margin of error, don't seem to possess high school level writing skills. Another huge, overlapping portion have social issues of one kind or another that make conversing and reasoning with them almost impossible. From my point of view, this includes those that are simply boorish interested primarily in sex in that most unsexy, doofus like way. Because of this, female writers, and especially those who *do* rise to the advanced literary level, are reticent to play with males. You see this reflected in ads - \"Female seeking female playing male.\" That is how bad it is. So, why?\n\nLet me start here by making two points clear for those already thinking of messaging me to tell me what a c\\*nt I am -\n\n\\- No, I don't hate men. As a straight woman, I'm actually pretty into dudes. I like the entire man thing. Man hands and man smells, and I can even find endearment enough to give the typical guy in real life a pass on sometimes being a little dodo. A lot of my dearest friends are guys and I often get on with them more than I do with many women. Clearly not all men are idiots. If I thought that were true, it would be even more depressing than this already is.\n\n\\- No, I don't think men are inherently chauvinistic or sexist. I know and have known some decidedly woke AF dudes in my day IRL and, again, that totally gives me hope. Yes, *some* guys are the ones that will cat call you from their car as you walk by and some are harassing jackasses, but I'm not sure that those are even close to the majority nowadays, if they ever were. The internet just has a way of amplifying the worst, loudest voices in a very annoying way.\n\n\\- No, I don't hate sex. I'm a sex-positive, kink-positive person. I've got my own share of kinks and preferences, likes and dislikes as anyone else. Sex isn't usually the stated goal of my roleplay. More often, I tend to fade to black, or else because it's a longer term story people bail before we get to it. But if my partner and I actually line up there and it works out - awesome!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what happens? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a female writer, I'll post an ad with thorough explanation on what I am looking for, rules, requirements, and a request for a writing sample. It's my feeling that having a partner that can write in complete and legible sentences is half the battle. If you are smart enough to write properly, it's likely because you have taken an interest in learning and reading in your life. That's already a leg up above most. Usually, a writing sample illuminates what I most need to know. Of course, this is where a good portion of people drop off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get honest questions like: \"What's a writing sample?\" Or, if I get them provided, they are barely readable. Long, endless run on sentences separated by ellipses and which don't seem to go anywhere are intercut with spelling errors and (as with this one guy who just messaged me) sometimes forgetting their place entirely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir plots, if they have any, do not make sense. Maybe it is a fandom or some adaptation of a fandom, despite having clearly stated I am not into those. I'll get some loophole argument about how it's just *based* on the Marvel universe they learned about for the first time when Iron Man came out and they were eight. Maybe its an unironic, unexamined cliche centered on wish fullfillment for them. Their character is going to be 6'6\" and built like Conan the Barbarian and they refer to themselves as \"alpha\" - a term with no real meaning except to single the user out as a particularly pathetic and impotent type IRL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes the idea is just a premise: boy meets girl. This contains no apparent plot or seem interested in adding one. To me, this strikes as just an excuse to play out dating and sex scenarios. Again, not against dating or sex, but I can go procure myself the real thing. Making googoo eyes across a bar at a bland, uninteresting character I wouldn't f\\*ck with their own d\\*ck just for the reward of, again bland, vanilla e-sex? No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVery often, it is clear from the way the person is speaking ooc and the kind of rudimentary character their sample displays that I am dealing with a child. I don't mean someone that acts like a child or is childish, I mean a literal person bellow the legal age or extremely close to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey may provide a sample in the first person, they continually get tripped up in referring to their character as themselves.   \n\n\n\"So I'll go over here.\"  \n\"You mean, you are planning for your character to do that?\"  \n\"Right. My character ;)\"  \n\n\nCreeptastic again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a woman (and a human being with half a thought in my head) I know that trying to engage with anyone like this is a waste of my time. Chances are good that if I open with the first post, they will tell me they are suddenly not sure if they can keep up, or just immediately ditch proving I've wasted my time, but not before having done so. Otherwise, if I try to be kind and politely say *no, thank you,* they are likely to fly off the handle. Then I need to deal with some kid on the spectrum that has never kissed a girl before sending me harassing messages about killing and raping me until I block them. You guys know - the pleasure of being a girl online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I'm also - apparently - a damn sucker, I'll sometimes feel bad. I'll think back to when I was 14 or 15 starting out in roleplay, and relied on older and more experienced writers to help me out now and again, so I'll try to throw them a bone. \"Hey, kid, thanks so much for the sample and interest. I think we're on different writing levels right now. But keep up the work!\" Nope. Again, I'm a c\\*nt that should die a thousand fiery deaths, preferably after raping. A good number of these will tell you happily how no one will ever want to write with a picky, snobby b\\*tch like you, then throw some MAGA ranting on the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a real exchange I just had:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThem: (provides a sample that has a thousand errors and seems to be based on an anime)\n\nMe: Thanks so much for the interest. Unfortunately I don't think we line up to well, so I am going to pass anyway. Good luck in your search!\n\nThem: Why not? You said you wanted literate and I provide for you a literate sample\n\nMe: Yes, I appreciated the sample. I just don't think we are a match. Thanks.\n\nThem: You confuse me though\n\nThem: Why are you having an ad for RP if you don't want to RP\n\nThem: HELLO\n\nThem: ????\n\nMe: I have an ad in order to search out partners. It's not a guarantee I will play with anyone. \n\nThem: I think you're just a b\\*tch good luck with that attitude and ever finding partner,LOL\n\nThem: Tell me why you wont RP wiTh me tho\n\nMe: Oi. Please, honestly, kid. Just take a polite no for an answer. I don't want to block you.\n\nThem: Now what I am a kid as you call me? FYi I am 19 a legal adult... LOL Fine I see that you are just not worth my time if all you do is name call\n\n\\- You are now blocked by *Them* \\- \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, really really. This happens several dozen times any time an ad gets placed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe they are just smart enough to have watched (never read) Tolkien. Said dude might want to play an orc or a paladin, maybe a well endowed dragon, you know - typical JRR. Half the time they want all this to take place on another planet of their own design. They've put *way too much thought* into languages and races. They know the government and currency, and want you to read their minds on how this perfectly etched vision should look. They are reticent with details, insisting that it's \"pretty simple\" while it reads like anything but, and like you are being set up to fail because you can't divine how to play this very specific character they've been secretly salivating over in their own minds for months or years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you give them the benefit of the doubt and think, *well, at least they are being creative* you'll quickly learn that the race they want played have breasts that never stop growing or live off consuming semen. But *also* they want you to memorize a thousand years of that creature's distant ancestry before fulfilling some hyper fetish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's pretend for a minute we clear all the hurdles illustrating a potential partner as simply brain dead. A potential male partner submits a sample that actually reads like something you'd find in a novel. They are capable of holding a simple, polite conversation. For a brief, shinning second you think, *maybe*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the (VERY SMALL) percentage of male players at the advanced level are also d\\*cks. Some will pretend they are \"different\" and not interested in sex, something I'm not completely sure a healthy adult person can be. Others will slyly admit that is what they are after while openly flirting OOC. I've had men casually drop information like their wife being in another room while I thought we were discussing something entirely SFW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of these guys are over sharers. They will try to chat you up, but also want to show you unsolicited photos of their family. Let me be straight forward here with all you guys reading - this is a lady boner killer to end all killers. I don't want to see or know about your kids or your wife. I don't care what a b\\*tch she is or how your marriage is basically dead. It makes you look bad, if anything. Like you are both a sleaze that lacks the guts to go out and actually get laid, or leave your wife, and also like you are the sort of man that likes to use your family to make excuses. Both are super gross and not a person I want to know.   \n\n\nI'd honestly *very strongly* prefer to write with single people whenever possible because they last thing I am at all interested in is having anything to do with anyone's personal drama. Definitely I know that RP isn't life and there's a clear line separation between the two for me, however it is personal and can be intimate, and I don't want to either do that with someone I don't like or respect, or be involved in a mess not of my own creation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, even among the somewhat smarter set, there's a good chance saying a simple *no* will get an angry, reactive response. I know there are a lot of people using RP Land as their primary source of social interaction, and that isn't helping. And I also know that sometimes even smart people get their wires cross, or something can be interpreted wrong in text and cause offense and a bad reaction. However, I think being honest a lot of these aren't due to misunderstandings so much as a hatred of women who talk back that gets fomented on the internet. Just try and claim I am wrong and I can start pointing to dark corners right here on Reddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's say that we're past *all* that. This new perspective partner had a great writing sample. They are smart and seem to \"get it\" on all the points I want them to get. They are good humored and quick on their feet. They have some ideas and they are open to plotting and brainstorming together until yours can merge. Their ideas are original and thought out. Their character ideas, too, show originality and promise. It seems like they have some genuine love of the written word and an interest in telling a big, cinematic sort of story. In other words, a dream.\n\n \n\nHere's where the final problem comes up, these folks often equate smart with being a prude and have a difficult time unwinding (or removing the stick) long enough to make the play fun. They usually want an organic (one thing I am about,) vanilla (a think I'm less interested in) relationship set up. They are not at all open to non-humans, or playing anything but what is essentially a male model, despite any out of the box premise. They don't like sci fi. They don't like any kind of fantasy or magical realism. They think snobby and clever are the same things and don't enjoy adventure that draws away from long narrations about how fascinatingly broken their character is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey refuse to give any sort of clear direction on any NSFW points, but expect you to figure out on your own the unsavory thing they (also) secretly desire because speaking to it would concede they, too, are some sort of human. If you bring it up, they won't commit to playing SFW either, which is a red flag of its own because it means they *do* intend to include sex, they just aren't confident enough to explain it. In other words, they are no f\\*cking fun at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes, I go with this. \\*Most\\* of the time, honestly, because the fact is that 9/10 times people ditch after a few posts or couple of scenes, if they even get that far. I'm personally just fine with SFW, anyway. I'm here to write not get off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt *does* sort of suck in some major ways, though. If I mean to have some action and adventure, for example. Super elite dude thinks thrills are dumb and that straight up slice of life that never leads anywhere is the way. They would prefer to write a completely endless soap opera to something with a defined beginning, middle, and end. It feels like some of these folks have never watched (or enjoyed) a film before. Their writing might be rich, but their ability to craft a compelling story that's anything more than masturbatory. Honestly, I doubt this type's ability to sustain my interest if they are both so disconnected from the rules of attraction and what does and does not structure a compelling story.  \n\n\nWhat would be *ideal* is if a partner actually loved writing and was on that advanced, novella level of writing - and also wasn't a d\\*ck, and was open and flexible. Yes, I'd even be down for NSFW in the right context. Often, I steer harder away from these things not because I don't like sex. (Pro-tip, dudes, all girls like sex.) I do so because I know unequivocally if I want quality I have to look in places where that is discouraged whereas if I want some k\\*nk sh\\*t I will never find it with anyone of quality.   \n\n\nCliche ideas can be fun with someone that can write the hell out of them. I'd be down for swashbuckling adventure, lovecraftian horrors, fish out of water stories, and about a million other things. I'd love it if the fun, scary, movie-like plot can have an additional layer of character development and interaction. Even better if we can take a premise we know works - two characters on the run and forced to get along - and layer it over yet again with a setting that fascinates (1970s anyone?) and social commentary/exploration. If that person *also*, **somehow**, was magically into the same k\\*nk and wrote like a novelist? Holy Hell. They might never pry me off them.  I'd be in love with the writing right now instead of venting all this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just seems like this doesn't actually exist. There's *no* male players that are both \"elite\" and capable of holding frank discussions about what they are after. *If* they exist, I don't know where the hell they are hiding but it certainly doesn't seem to be Reddit.   \n\n\nPlease, before you come in with corrections - I have been playing a long time and I don't need any lessons taught to me. I do get that accidents happen and personalities clash sometimes just because. I have looked in other places; in fact just about all the places. I have zero expectations of any of this changing pretty much ever. I'm fortunate to already have partners in place to fill most of my time, so I am hardly destitute in that regard. I just wanted to b\\*tch and vent. Maybe have one or two fellow players groan along with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't get in a twist just because I insulted your status as an \"alpha.\" I'm certain there is someone just young and dumb enough to think that's appealing, probably *many* someones. Instead of pointing your rage here, why don't you go vent yourself by getting some of that f\\*ta c\\*ckholding poon you are all about and turn on some Ben Shapiro? There you go. Feel better.",

I tried to reply and discuss about the matter, but in the end I decided to leave it so the server will die as the place I nurtured to life and not as something terrible people would avoid. \n\nAfterall I play a big lot of npcs and characters in that place and I am sure that the server will die without my presence, but I still feel a lot bad for leave it alone to rot on the sun just because things didn't go as I wished they would go, and that the server could grow and cause us all stress. \n\nI feel lost and I hate everything of this situation. I do want that place to die but also I do not want to because I love to rp in there. \nI hate people see me as a sort of child but I believe everyone of you will consider me as such. \n\nCan I dare to ask if someone is able to tell me what should I do? I feel so lost about what happened today I feel disgusted and distruptive over everything but at the same time guilty and sad.\nWhat should I do?\nI rely on you today...",

            "selftext": "So I'll start point blank, I hate FC's. Not references, but face claims that use a real person's face. The reason being I saw someone who I knew being used as one, and it immediately put it into just how creepy it was at the end of the day. I should clarify that this person is a semi-famous celebrity and my sister-in-law for my half brother. So seeing someone who I've known my entire life growing up being used as a RP reference is just creepy.  \n\n\nNormally when I mention this, I often get the same response by people pushing me to use a FC instead. \"She would be flattered if she found out people were..\" No, she wouldn't. I think I know my near sister better than some person on the internet who's only saying that because they want me to play a specific appearance they've had saved in their library for 5 months.  \n\n\nBecause of that I switched to drawn references, and around 6 or maybe 7 months ago I started getting into commissions. You know, art I pay for of my characters. I actually have quite a few. 12 to be exact. \\[Or more so 11 due to one being exclusive to a single partner.\\] but still I've got quite the cast for using primaries.  \n\n\nAround 5-6 months ago \\[around a month after I commissioned my first piece.\\] I had someone claiming he was owned by them. I had never watermarked them before, so I didn't realize people would flat out take art of him. Lucky for me, it was a low quality piece, and his old appearance is retired now. Because of that, I started watermarking them and stuck to only the options I had designed for my primary.  \n\n\nNow I'm also upfront about this. I mention it in any ad I post, and most often if I message someone I'll point it out since I'm not going to try and mislead them into hours of plotting only for it to be a deal breaker. The problem is people seem to not take it so well.  \n\n\nI have 2 human characters. While the rest are fantasy or alien races which are used for a lot of non-realistic genres. I even state that if they want only human to let me know, as I'll more than happily stick to one of the two.\n\nI also even tell them they're free to tell me which ones they like and don't like so I won't go with one they aren't interested in. I'm even happy to let them pick a specific one.  \n\n\nThe problem is people don't respect boundaries. I've had people ghost when they ask to see unwatermarked versions and I tell them \"No.\"  \n\n\nAnother is people often asking me to commission a new character just for the RP, and will often freak out when I say \"No.\" since I prefer quality pieces, the artists I work with charge about $45 for cell shaded pieces. Which is a lot to drop on a character for someone I have never met once in my life before.  \n\n\nAnd then the biggest is the fact that I keep all my commissioned art in a single google slides gallery for easy access to let people see them. Since me and a single partner \\[the one who one of my characters is exclusive for\\] get our characters commissioned together quite a bit, people think they are entitled to that as well.  \n\n\nAnd I can live with that, It's what it is. But I get a lot of people who like to be condescending about it. They'll make it known that they don't have pre-made characters \\[I adjust them for the RP, so it's more appearance than anything at this point.\\] and that me having them designed makes them lesser as characters.  \n\n\nHonestly, this is more of a rant than anything. It's just kind of annoying that people have to assume that they're a carbon copy because of their appearance.",

            "selftext": "Yeah so r/Roleplay banned me again \ud83d\ude02 Yeah I ban evaded so I guess that technically means I deserve it. But what's real funny is how the mod comes to my post to cover their ass only to flip to 'oh **you** broke the rules so I'm banning you'. You can read all the comments by them in my last post. I don't care much to use their sub anymore even if it's the best for exposure. Honestly, their gross misuse of power isn't worth it.\n\nBecause of that, a few other people with bad experiences with r/Roleplay created a new roleplay sub for everyone to post to. Want to post a group? Post it. Want it to be adult. Post it. Want it to be on Discord? Post it! Sure we got rules but at least we follow them ourselves. Our sub also has open chatrooms for writing help and questions. If you're interested then check out r/RoleplayToo...yeah I know...we're petty but we're still better lol.",

They write SUPER detailed but I never felt pressured to match them in skill. \n\nWell, our characters meet, and her character was eating Sea Salt Icecream. Obviously you can tell where my brain went.\n\nSo for the next few hours, I keep making kingdom hearts references. Heck, I was even considering a crossover RP (something I haven\u2019t done in a hot minute.)\n\nA few hours go by without her responding. It was pretty late so I figured she\u2019d passed out.\n\nThen she DMs me. And she\u2019s like \u201chave you been referencing kingdom hearts this whole time?\u201d\n\nAnd I reply \u201cyeah! It\u2019s nice to meet another fan!\u201d\n\nShe types for a second, then reply\u2019s with \u201cI don\u2019t like kingdom hearts. Sea salt ice cream is just my favorite flavor.\u201d\n\nSo that was embarrassing.",

            "selftext": "Okay so I first met this guy on a forum based site. We'll call him \"W.\" This all happened a few years ago, thankfully, but I still look back on him and shake my dang head, ya know?   \n\n\nRight then, so we met in a story that was based on a Roman town during the Roman Empire days that had recently been ransacked by vikings. My character was a Vestal Virgin, which is a type of priestess who would tend the hearth of a temple in a city. So long as the fire stayed lit, the city was safe. Idk, google it.   \n\n\nHer thing was that the temple had been part of the ransacking. I suggested that she'd been caught up in it before she hid away in a cellar, but I very purposefully did not outline one way or the other if she was a virgin still or not because I'm personally of the mind that it's nobody's damn business. The character got approved, nobody bat an eye at that very minuscule part of her bio.   \n\n\nEnter W. He applied and then immediately started messaging me asking if she was still a V-card carrier or not. I kept side-stepping, before eventually saying that I hadn't outlined it on purpose and it was going to stay her secret unless or until it became relevant. He gave me the ole \"-chuckles- well *usually* in RP, you would disclose this to your writing partner.\"   \n\n\nMe: If it comes up with my writing partner and they really need to know, I'll tell them. I don't have a WP right now though, so I'm not worried.   \nW: -chuckles softly- I'm saying that in mature RP, you would disclose this.   \nMe: Why's that?  \nW: I would like to know because my character is interested in yours.   \nMe: Play hasn't even started yet, and I don't do premade pairings.   \n\n\nEventually, Chucklefuck derps off. We all get to writing. He keeps making really lecherous comments about my character, my character casually doesn't hear them and so we ignore. The group made it through maybe one scene before everyone just sort of lost interest.   \n\n\nFast forward, I joined two servers on Discord. One was a GoT, the other was a Supernatural Slicer in a Big Modern City. He followed me into both and again, tried asking if my characters were virgins. One was from Dorne, the other was a meth-addicted stripper. I told him to take a wild guess and went on with my life.   \n\n\nFast forward again, I ended up leaving both in favour of creating my own server. He joined, but my character who actually was a virgin at that time for fun demonic sacrificial goodness. As soon as he followed me into that server, I casually let her oopsie-daisy her v-card through another guy's card reader, just to make sure he knew how thoroughly that wasn't happening.   \n\n\nThis guy starts pestering me asking to read the logs of that smut scene. I pulled a thesaurus app out and must have given him no less than 9 different variations of \"mate, stop,\" before he left *me* alone and instead started pestering the other guy for the logs. After some very firm nopes and a threat to ban him, he moved on *ish.*  \n\n\nWe come to find out some fun tidbits about him. He teaches middle school IRL. No big deal. Oh, except that he only liked to RP with really young looking, virgins. As if that wasn't creepy enough, we had **one** player in the entire server, the only one to ever be allowed in, that wasn't over the age of 18. She was, in fact, just two months shy of her 18th birthday, but we were friends IRL so I let her in and just restricted access to certain channels. Guess who he beelined for after I turned him down? Go on, take a wild guess.   \n\n\nShe eventually left because she started college and just didn't have time. My character's boyfriend also left the story, so then W hopped back into my DMs and for no less than 4 hours straight, he gave me his version of a TedTalk meant to persuade me to rewind my character's entire story up until then to make her a virgin again, so that he could pop her cherry. Screw the overall plot. Screw all the character progression she'd made. Her only worth lay between her legs in her past.   \n\n\nI thought he was kidding. When I realized he wasn't, my face was stuck in this slow-motion frame by frame going from laughter to confusion to disbelief to shock to horror and then anger. WHO DOES THAT!?!   \n\n\nW did, apparently. Friggin' creep. I banned him. Oof.",

            "selftext": "I just saw a post about r/ a sub we all know and it made me think of this because they just took down my group server ad for another stupid reason. (I use my alt account now for their sub)\n\nFor context, I had many problems before this, they kept giving me the ring around about their rules and taking my posts down even if I followed them. I made a group server that was based on the idea of Life and Death being actual beings, it took place in a war period between Hell and Humans. I posted the plot, already being very careful of what I say because we all know how they are.\n\nAnd what do you know? Bam, post removed. I was so confused because I had been so careful so I messaged and asked why. I wish I had the convo to show everyone here. But I'll make a mock one just to explain easier.\n\nMe: Why was my group removed, I followed all the rules.\n\nMods: No cursing allowed. You kept cursing in your post.\n\nMe (confused af): I didn't curse at all, can you tell me what word I used?\n\nMod (obviously annoyed): 'Hell' is a BAD word. No bad words allowed.\n\n*insert shocked pikachu face*\n\nMe: I was referencing the place Hell, it was even capitalized. Do you want me to say Underworld instead? I didn't because that implies Greek/Roman mythology type servers. I also didn't realize you considered hell to be a curse word.\n\nMod: *no response for two days*\n\nMe: Hey can I change Hell to Underworld?\n\nMod: *Bans my ass*\n\nTo say in the least I was irritated. I ended up making an alt to use their sub and I posted a group their the other day. They took it down because I said I would prefer adults only to join due to the age of most people in the group. Idk if it's just me, but they seem to let it go with clearly underage users. I see people looking for clear smut that are not adults and yet they just seem to get away with it. Either the mods are power tripping and taking stuff down they have a problem with or they are trying to fill the sub a certain way without being caught.",

It\u2019s not fun anymore. It\u2019s just messed up toxic shit and I\u2019m over it. I don\u2019t think either of us are happy. I can\u2019t even talk to her about problems I have with a character without my stomach churning and my anxiety raising. And she can\u2019t talk to me about it without fidgeting (we video chat these discussions).\n\nIt\u2019s just so bad right now. I told her I wanna stop, and she just got real upset and depressed and kept blaming what happened in the past for what\u2019s happening now. But neither of us are having fun. Our characters are just bland and boring and the plot is becoming too much.\n\nI wanna tell her that, but I\u2019m afraid of what she\u2019ll say and or do. I don\u2019t want her to feel worse or anything. She deserves someone better to rp with. I\u2019m literally done.",

I've mostly only ever Roleplayed in the indie community. At the beginning of the year, because of personal stuff, I took a break from it, and when I came back I wasn't happy with indie anymore and wanted to try a group.\n\nI joined this group and a few days later within the group I met this other rper, let's call them Ivy. We hit it off right away - they were a great writer and we had crazy chemistry IC and ooc. It took us very little to grow our own ship which became our biggest otp - I'm telling you, I've never felt this sort of mutual enthusiasm with any of my previous rp experiences. It was amazing, we both lived and breathed our otp and had so. Much. Fun.\n\nOver time we ended up leaving this rp because of issues we had the admins - founded our own with a couple friends, kept having fun, kept having our ship, and we talked ooc a LOT, whenever we were online we'd be chatting - it was good, a great friendship. To the point they even helped me through some rough stuff.\n\nAnd then it just... Stopped.\n\nThey had to take some time off tumblr because of personal issues. The last message I got from them said they'd be back by Monday - Monday passed without a word and now it's been almost three weeks. It's just really kinda sad that I probably won't ever talk to them again, and I won't even know if they're okay at all, since I don't follow them on any social media.\n\nIt's sad, cause of all the online friendships I had, this was the first that truly felt perfect. But hey, I guess that's part of the game too.",

            "selftext": "Yes it's gotten worse. I wish I were joking. For those of you that have no idea what's going on, here's a link to my original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/ijpwum/ive\\_got\\_one\\_of\\_the\\_worst\\_youll\\_ever\\_hear\\_i\\_swear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/ijpwum/ive_got_one_of_the_worst_youll_ever_hear_i_swear/)  \n\n\nAnd a meme a friend of mine made, to show their hypocrisy that I find entertaining; [https://imgur.com/a/VscLSet](https://imgur.com/a/VscLSet)  \n\n\nPoint is- this person went from insane to HYPER insane. They have now taken to doxxing me on instagram. They told their followers that I am a predator and posted my reddit username. Apparently, by their rationale, me warning people about them (aka commenting on their post that they were looking to play an underage character in a nsfw context), and reporting to the mods makes me a predator. However, I am NOT the only one that's experienced this with them. Another reddit user, who posted here in the past, told me that not only did this person want to rp nsfw smut scenes with them, with a character that looked maybe 12 years old. Yet this bad rper posts on instagram how they're 'assexual' so that means they're not looking for nsfw scenes.  \n\n\nI don't give a damn what their sexuality is, their real age, their mental illnesses (which they went on a tangent about on insta as well, how they have anxiety and therefore I'm an even worse predator?)- there is NO CONTEXT in which it is okay to play an underage character in smut or nsfw scenarios. This bad rper keeps insisting, relentlessly, that Ruko is their age- 18- but in these meme, they admit that they TOLD ME Ruko wasn't 18 when I asked.  \n\n\nI haven't slandered them, because nothing I've said is untrue. And unlike this badrper, I have the receipts to back it up. And yet they've threatened me and mods with legal action, they continue to say I've misunderstood this art, and that I'm 'getting people to attack' her. I haven't told anyone to attack her. I've only shared her posts with mods and asked them to do what they see fit, and told that fellow rper, who also had an extremely negative experience, what she was already saying about the both of us.   \n\n\nI have a LOT of reason to believe this person was RPing smut while they were underage as well, because they say they just turned 18 recently, but on their main account, have nsfw rp requests dating back to a year or more. They're upset they can't draw Ruko again? Good. Stop drawing a character you admit is a child, and stop drawing them naked.  \n\n\nSo I guess the point to all this is to say that people are effing crazy.",

            "selftext": "I saw an advertisement for someone looking to explore the life of a noble in a sci-fi or fantasy setting. I messaged them, and our introductions were nice and cordial.\n\nThey proceeded to explain how they wanted to roleplay a Star Wars AU, following Princess Leia. I expressed my desire to keep my roleplays non-canon, as it's where I feel my most comfortable. They agreed, and we talked some more.\n\nWhen the presence of the characters age came up, I suggested that she be a younger, still mature adult. My partner disagreed, saying how she wanted her to be an older, mentor-type character. I offered the compromise of a roleplay taking place between different periods of the characters life, but they outright refused. They said that they wouldn't compromise at all, stating that they would want both us to be on board with an idea. I found this rather odd, since that's the *purpose* of a compromise.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I decided we should part ways, if we had a problem on something as simple as a character's age. I removed them on Discord, and thought that would it.\n\nI get a message from them on Reddit, going off on me for being rude and insulting me. I was in no way trying to be rude, if that is even worth mentioning. I explained that they didn't need to insult me, and should instead simply forget about us talking. This only enraged them, causing them to chastise me for seeming passive aggressive, even going so far as to look through my account for ammunition.\n\nThat last part disgusted me. My interests are my own, and trying to use them as a weapon against me is intolerable. It irks me that some can be so petty as a result of something so insignificant.\n\nAm I justified in being upset? Was this simply a blunder on my part or a dodged bullet? I'm looking forward to seeing what other people think, and am open to any and all criticism. Thanks in advance.",
