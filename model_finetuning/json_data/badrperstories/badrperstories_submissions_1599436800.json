I was also involved in a roleplay server that had some of the best time of my life there. Now it all fell apart. She and I fell out after months of the actual relationship behind the roleplay being toxic on both ends and I was banned from the roleplay server for causing unnecessary drama(I take full responsibility for what I did). Now I'm in a wilderness. People that I've tried to message to roleplay have either not responded or we've only done it for a day before the person vanished. I feel close to putting down my pen and pad and calling it a day with writing and roleplaying in general. I just don't know what to do anymore.",

            "selftext": "Hey all! My name is Pumpkin. It\u2019s so nice to meet you and thank you for taking a look at my little rant! Today I have something to get off of my chest. To give some background about myself, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 8-9 years now. I am not perfect or a literary prodigy by any stretch of the imagination, however, I do try. This has been an issue I have been feeling for quite some time, but I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to word it, and even now I\u2019m having trouble finding the right words, so bare with me. \n\nI am finding myself growing more and more distant from roleplay, and it isn\u2019t because I do not enjoy it. Rather, I feel like it\u2019s often the bullying, immaturity and blatant lack of respect for a person\u2019s requests and expectations. Let me try to break this down better:\n\nBullying- If you do not like someone\u2019s prompt... how about just moving on? (Unless it\u2019s something morally apprehensible). Why downvote or take time out of your day to send nasty messages? This has been happening more and more in recent years, and it just disheartens me that people think this way. \n\nDisregard for Prompts: I get flooded on the daily with messages that totally contradict my posts. Oh you want a slow-burn romance? Here\u2019s a hot, steamy scene that is the opposite of what you asked for. Now I don\u2019t judge, if you enjoy that, great. But why waste both of our times by posting something you KNOW I wouldn\u2019t enjoy doing? Digging deeper into this matter, avoiding rules/not even bothering to read them are also a major pet peeve.\n\nRight now I am going through a lot because of COVID. Roleplay was once my escape, a fun passtime to enjoy when I\u2019m not working. Now it\u2019s become a battle and at times upsetting experience. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m alone in this? Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if you\u2019ve ever felt the way I\u2019m feeling, I\u2019m always here to listen/chat \u2764\ufe0f you are wanted and I hope you have a wonderful day",

            "selftext": "I'll be honest, even I'm not quite sure what I am hoping to achieve with this post, or even who I am trying to reach with it, but I figured this place would be the best place to make some observations I've made about roleplaying on reddit. \n\nAs my reddit age shows I've been around this block for quite a while, and whilst for the longest time I refused to make it my primary means of communication and partner searching, I've kept a solid eye on all of the major partner search subreddits for at least a year now. In that time I've found several fantastic partners - many of whom I write with to this day, and am quite satisfied with. As such this isn't a post that is motivated by some denial or disappointment with the people I've been roleplaying with, but rather an odd observation I've made in relation to other people searching for partners.\n\nI'd like you (yes, you - the person reading this at this very moment) to go to your roleplaying subreddit of choice and do the unthinkable: change the search preferences to be by new. \n\nDone?\n\nAlright, now just start scrolling back and do so for at least a few weeks and tell me if you notice anything.\n\nDone?\n\nYeah, I can almost guarantee you spotted at least a couple of people reposting the same partner search post, again and again and again. I can almost guarantee if you do the same search on other subreddits you'll also find those people doing the same thing there as well. Now... to quote the ancient Finnish saying here,\"It ain't my cow in the ditch here\", but having been following these subreddits with a keen eye since the pandemic started, I've noticed a bit of a theme with these people. That theme being a fairly inflated number of the word 'no' that results in the same ad harkening to at least 2019 being still posted ad nauseam.\n\nNow... I don't mean the word 'no' as in in of itself, but rather the criteria they've set forth for allowing people to write with them. It's alright to be picky, and by god I can be picky as hell when it comes to who I want to write with, but when reading some of these requirements I can't help, but mentally keep checking off different levels, types and genders of writers and try to calculate just what teeny percentage of roleplayers actually fit into said criteria.\n\nBased on the fact that said ads are still being posted nearly daily, probably not many.\n\nSo... I'd like to open the floor here a bit and ask you, the readers for your opinions on just how picky you think an ad should be when it comes to writing partners? Obviously we've all got our requirements and desires, but how many of yours are 'hard limits' for allowing a person to even interact with you? Do you for example write out an entire gender in addition to requiring a particular writing level - or is having that person 'click' with you enough for you?",

            "selftext": "Today this crazy thing happened on a server I am in: in this server we have a channel for NSFW pictures, and a member suddenly pinged some other members, including me, asking if there was any bisexual or lesbian women. Of course, I was surprised by that question, but things got really messed up when she explained why xe asked that question. \n\nThis person said that as a bisexual woman, she was feeling objectified and an object for men's pleasure because of pictures of hot anime girls and for the comments that men had written under those, so she proposed a solution: men are not allowed to upload these kind of contents and are not allowed to comment it, but only add a reaction. Women are allowed to upload, but their comments have to be rescricted. \n\nI think it is totally messed up because, first of all, the comments were not even offensive since most of them are monosyllables like \"hot\", \"sexy\", \"beautiful\", so in which way were the comments offensive? \n\nSecondly, she was trying to prevent men from liberty of speech and say their own opinion and from posting pictures that want to share with their friends. \n\nThe simpliest solution another member proposed to her is to block the channel, but she kept on going by saying that her friend had to delete a picture because it made people feel uncomfortable. Now I can tell that picture was utterly gross and disgusting and full of blood and that's the reason many people asked for the picture to be deleted.  Basically she wanted to compare a polite request from members with preventing men from uploading contents and speak their mind. \nEventually she left the server since no one wanted to listen to her.\n\nNow I can understand that people might feel uncomfortable with some kinds of pictures, but isn't all of this way over the top? What would you have done if you were in my place?\nI would really like to hear you guys' opinion about this matter, it'd be much appreciated.",

            "selftext": "So I decided to indulge in my first specifically erotic-themed RP not too long ago. I got back into this hobby around the beginning of the year and since then it's been fun exploring a variety of stories, and since I don't shy away from the more adult subjects &amp; scenes, I figured what the hell, let me just satisfy that itch and dive on in. I found an ad that appealed to me because of the theme/genre, and one that promised more of a story to build the smut around than just pure smut (for me, there's gotta be some *reason* the characters are getting together to make it more compelling).\n\nMy partner seemed cool after we chatted a bit about plot, characters, and so on, and I started us off. We wrote back and forth over the next few weeks; his writing was decent, if a little flat -- as in, more focused on action, technical details, not much about the inner workings of his character's thoughts (which I would have preferred). But, whatever, it was fine -- still better written than most. And I keep waiting for us to get to the erotic parts since, well, that was the whole *point* behind the RP, after all. I even tried to set up an ideal situation for it: my character's taking a bath, maybe he can walk in on her, but nope, nothing. He just decides to have his character go have dinner instead, in a different part of the house, so we're not even interacting.\n\nBy the time we finally *do* meander our way there (it's about 12K words at this point), the writing is still just... flat. Technical. Lackluster. I felt like I was interacting with a robot. I've got to have my character take the lead just to jog things along (and because of the storyline, she's supposed to be inexperienced/sheltered, but whatever, maybe she's a burning ball of lust underneath just so I can justify *anything* happening!) \n\nI enjoy some good banter/dialogue to intersperse in the sexy scenes, too, but all his dialogue was along the lines of: \"Yes, continue, I am enjoying this\" or \"Yes, that is excellent\" in response to whatever she does. Again, robotic. Not hot. Who *talks* like that?\n\nAnd when we finally get to the culmination, as it were, he puts *no* effort into any sort of foreplay whatsoever. It's just, kiss, kiss, well, guess it's time to stick it in!\n\nI'm still trying to salvage something at this point -- not sure why, so I have my character react accordingly, like, Ow! That's not comfy, and I message him and try to delicately point out that it doesn't really work like that (and incidentally ask how old he is, since *maybe* he's not that experienced IRL? I probably should have asked at the outset, but given that his ad was specifically on an erotic-RP forum and his writing level seemed mature, I hadn't thought to). Apparently the dude's in his thirties.\n\nWe limped along for a couple more posts, but I finally had to throw in the proverbial towel. Erotic RP, in my mind, should be fun, titillating, exciting, compelling, but this just... wasn't. It was a slog. I felt a little guilty, since we'd spent a fair amount of time on the plot and setup, which I really liked, and I didn't want to leave him hanging.\n\nSo I messaged him and just politely explained that I wasn't quite feeling it, and sometimes people just don't vibe together, yadda yadda. Thankfully, he was really gracious about it and we managed to part with a \"good luck in your search\" sentiment, so that's all good.\n\nSo, overall, I can't say he was a *bad* RPer. Just maybe not a very good lover? Incidentally, this is also the second male partner I've played with who just completely glossed over any sort of foreplay (the other one wasn't a specifically erotic RP but we still eventually had our characters do the deed, and that was pretty lackluster, too). So I'm not saying \"all men\" do this, but it's still two out of two, and I've had much better luck with female players who seem to get what's hot and what isn't. Maybe this is why we're the leading consumers of erotica.\n\nSo the PSA part of this post is: Guys? Do the foreplay. Do the banter. Make it sexy. Technical descriptions of the act are not compelling. But getting into a character's mindset and showing us why they *want* to can be a helluva lot of fun. We're all here because of our love of stories, characters, their interactions, and the written word and, when done right, that combo can be hot as hell. Try and make your partner squirm in a good way. ;)",

            "selftext": "I want to stress at first that I support every gender and every sexual orientation, so I hope I won't discriminate anyone by writing this post. This isn't something that happened to me, but somehow I still experienced it and I was disgusted by it. \n\nI used to follow a page about Roleplay, and at first sight it was a really fun page, with also some advice that helped me and gave me inspiration for my own RP. It was also clear from some posts that the admin of the page was a LGBT supporter, which is totally fine of course. \n\nOne day, however, the admin uploaded a post about heterosexuality in RP, saying that is was boring and basic. That shocked me a bit, so I started to dig more about it. In fact, I found out by some comments that many experienced Roleplay with this admin and that some even knew this person IRL. Basically, this person is totally against heterosexuality, so characters had to be either gay, trans, or black, otherwise you couldn't play. People hadn't any choice when it came to sexual orientation, because the admin wasn't giving any. Everything had to be played by xir own way. \nThe comments gave also an example saying that two canon characters in Harry Potter Roleplay had to be together because the admin wanted so, otherwise you were out.\n\nIt is really sad and shocking because in my opinion people should be free to create their own character how they want, they should have the right to choose whatever sexual orientation and whatever skin colour they want, otherwise it destroys all the fun of creating original characters and of course roleplay itself. It also destroys the meaning of LGBT, which is not \"gay and trans people are the best/the most powerful, heteros are losers\". LGBT fights for equality, so it is also sad that this person doesn't understand the true meaning of it.\n\nNow like I said, this experience didn't affect me personally. Have you ever had experiences like this one instead? It would be interesting to hear some opinions about this matter",

            "selftext": "Sorry, the title sounds harsh, but it is true. I get that all people sometimes need to vent a little/have the feeling that roleplaying is no fun for them anymore, and that is not what I mean. It is totally okay.\n\nI am talking about people who try to influence/manipulate mods or other writers to do everything their way by making them feel guilty if they don't. \n\nYou have a problem with the logic in one of their replies, but it is really just a tiny mistake and you point it out? They will go on and on about how they are a bad writer, they should not write at all and delete their character, and so on, until you feel bad for even pointing it out.\n\nYou don't have time to write for a while due to personal problems? They will react like it is obvious that they are the problem, you just don't want to write because they are a lousy roleplayer, if they were good you would try to write...until you feel the need to prove that you really don't have time to write.\n\nThere is a conflict with one of the other writers, but nobody is being aggressive or mean, it is just a little discussion? They will be in your inbox talking about if the other person does not leave, they will lose all the interest in the rp and be the one to leave, how this little discussion will now lead to them not writing for several weeks because they have lost all interest in the rp 'if nothing changes' (meaning I delete or give a warning to the other people that are involved).\n\n Most of the time, they end leaving no matter what you do after a while, because every innocent remark of another writer is interpreted by them as everyone hating their character/them, and if you as a mod don't call the other person out for basically doing nothing wrong, it is seen as a sign that you condone 'bullying'. You can only praise them and every idea of them, even if your answer to their ideas is just a neutral 'Yeah, sure, we can do that. When will be the best time, what do you think?' it is interpreted by them as you being not enthusiastic enough. \n\nThey will give you 'advice' on how to moderate the rp, which is really just a  thinly-veiled way to say 'Do everything I want you to do/delete everyone I do not like, you know how sensitive I am and I might leave if you don't:)'\n\nThey will act mean to other writers, but it is okay because they have 'personal/mental health problems and sometimes lash out' so everyone should forgive them right away. Meanwhile, they never care if anyone else in the rp does something bad because of similiar reasons.\n\nSeriously, if you act like this, nobody will want to write an rp with you. Your sensitivity is NOT a free pass to get everyone in a group or 1x1 rp to act how you want. If you are so sensitive that someone saying 'Hey, your reply has a little mistake in it, could you change it please?' will make you cry and write me endless monologues on how you are the worst writer in existence, maybe it is best if you quit roleplaying for a while.",
