            "selftext": "TL;DR - partner constantly powerplayed and metagamed so I ghosted our threads but we still spoke OOC. 2\u00bd years after my last post, he asked why I stopped writing with him and tried to pressure me into writing with him again. I said no and it got ugly. \n\nAbout three years ago, a friend asked to rp. Other problems aside, he powerplayed to hell and back. For example, his character snuck up on mine, pinned mine to the floor, disarmed him, and held my character's own gun to his head. My friend wrote how his character anticipated all mine's movements through telepathy and mine never had a chance to hit back. I decided to stop posting in that thread, but try others to give him a second chance. \n\nBrainstorming became a chore. I mentioned my bounty hunter character was a good shot and he laughed before saying his character would easily outshoot mine and steal credit for mine's work. I suggested my character sneaking around his and he said an NPC would discover mine and probably kill them. I suggested our characters work together and he said his character would have no use for mine because min was too weak. \n\nI decided to powerplay myself to see what happened and wrote that my character trapped his character using an Infinity Stone (Marvel AU). My friend's character could suddenly eat magic and consumed the power of the Infinity Stone with no negative effects besides feeling like they overate. \n\nThat was it for me. We'd done maybe 30 posts altogether across half a dozen threads, and he'd either metagamed or godmodded in all but two of his posts, so I had no hope of his behaviour correcting. Between that and the fact that he'd been sensitive to people critiquing his writing before, I just ghosted him. I know, I know, I should've been up front with him like an adult. I didn't post but eventually replied to him OOC when he pursued a conversation. \n\nOver the next 2\u00bd years, we often discussed my other sites and partners. I linked to posts saying I was proud of how I'd written certain parts. I vented about drama. I praised site admins. I mentioned I was apping characters he knew on other sites. He asked how my threads were going and even suggested lines for my posts. I was a bit ashamed of myself for ghosting but assumed he'd gotten the message and was okay with us no longer writing together. \n\nA few weeks ago, he said most of his partners dropped or ghosted him and asked why I'd stopped writing with him. He got defensive when I told him and asked for a second chance. He complained that I was being unfair when I declined and said he'd only powerplayed because he felt out of control in real life and took out his frustrations on his partners' characters. \n\nHe told me he'd shared our conversations with multiple people who suggested he end our friendship. I told him to leave if he wanted. He said he wanted an apology because I was a manipulative liar and claimed I told him I was taking a break from rp for health reasons. He couldn't provide proof, I searched back through our conversation (and my OOC posts on several other sites) and could find nowhere I'd mentioned my health besides the occasional complaint about the flu, even from before I stopped posting. \n\nHe said he was angry that I hadn't stopped him from writing a starter almost a year ago, that I didn't know he was working on, and claimed I'd led him on in regards to my intention to post. He refused to clarify. I was honest that I didn't believe that he thought I was still interested in writing with him. When I asked why he expected posts after years of nothing, he said he was done talking. \n\nIn a discussion on a rp resource forum, I noted that people often didn't realize they were the reason their partners left, and an ex partner of mine powerplayed yet had no idea why partners bailed. My friend attacked me for complaining about him behind his back and claimed he'd been hurt by my 'massive rant'. I pointed out that what I'd written on the forum was vague enough to be about anyone (it referred to several people besides him). I had to ask him multiple times if he was telling me what I was and wasn't allowed to post. \n\nHe claimed I'd lied about him on the forum. He contradicted things both of us had said recently as the previous day. He said I always told him that he was in the wrong when he had arguments with other roleplayers, when I simply said I could understand where the other person was coming from and suggested how he could avoid the same problem in the future. I proved everything he said was a lie with screenshots of our earlier conversations but he just doubled down. \n\nI finally snapped and told him that all his accusations were baseless and I was ending our relationship because he was being a dick. I blocked him before he replied because I was just exhausted. Apologies for length but didn't want to vent this much to one person so it's been bottled up.",

            "selftext": "I'll format this a bit like you might see over at r/rpghorrorstories, just because that's easier for me - hope you all don't mind.\n\nThe player I want to talk about concerns is a person I was friends with for about two years-ish, and the spedicif game behavior concerns a World of Darkness game we were in over Discord. The group was using various splats, all under the 20th anniversary edition rules as much as possible. Here is the cast of characters (with ages of said chars in parentheses):\n\n**GM:** My spouse, and the guy running the game (also played three 16M NPCs who were part of the friend group mentioned below)  \n**Me:** I was playing a Mage (17F)  \n**Fae:** the Changeling player (15F)  \n**Kitsune:** the Kitsune player (18F)\n\nThe concept of the game is that we were all students, aged 15-18, attending a private school in New England. Fae and Kitsune started out knowing what they were, while I learned along the way. Anyhow, we'll focus solely on Kitsune here, as they are the issue.\n\nKitsune had created their character as a female, with the concept of being an artist but also a cat burglar type. Over the course of game, that cat burglar part almost never came up. Things were going well initially - after our characters and some NPCs met up and formed a friend group, we were all good. Kitsune even treated Fae (who was a notable problem child) like alittle sister. \n\nThen Kitsune hooked up with one of the NPCs in the friend group. Things were still ok...right up until, as two teens do, they had sex. After that, the player sought out sex as often as possible. It escalted bit by bit...initially it was in secret, then it was wherever, then it was in public. There ws a group sex session with Kitsune and she decided she liked that, and invented a collar system to denote when anyone in the friend group could take advantage, when she belonged only to her boyfriend, and when she wasn't to be used by anyone. \n\nShe would even express pouting and disappointment if no one else took advantage of her when she wore said collar, especially out in public. Things got to such a point that my character, who had been good friends with her, got more and more distant, and eventually aggravated by the behavior (sad to say there was likely some carryover with ooc feelings).\n\nKitsune also dumped Fae when she got too annoying for her (note: Fae was new to rp in general and had been playing her character true to type - was just failing to compensate for not ousting herself from the friend group). She had a thing for my character, and she had a bad habit of if someone slightled her once, she went to an extreme (example: jock dumped slushie on her at school, so she broke into his house, assumed her big crinos kitsune form and took out the tendons behind his knees; another time same jock tossed her boyfriend and she nearly killed the jock).\n\nBoth ic and occ, Kitsune had to know everything that was going on. If a character went off to try and have a conversation in private, she'd so sneak and listen in unknown to them. Character on the phone? She used abilities to listen in on both ends as much as possible. The only way I foudn around this was for my char to speak a language she didn't know. OOC, player had to know what every little notification noise from discord or a phone was, and who it was from. \n\nThings got to a point where Kitsune professed to love the game so much and the story, that she pressured the GM into running it all the time. We played damn near every day! Burnout was happening for all of us, and Kitsune often wanted to play without Fae around to join us (Fae was the only one working, and eventually dropped, rejoining later as a different char who was immediately distrusted by Kitsune for no good reason). If we didn't play that day, Kitsune's player would geta ll bummed and sad, which was basically guilt-tripping the GM who would relent becuase they didn't want their friend to feel bad.  \n\nKitsune also, ic, went off on her char's bf when he experimented with a guy (she caught them kissing) and this was after she said she was okay with this. She got super jealous, and they had a fight about that, and a fight about something else a couple days later. Her solution? Create a scavenger hunt for him that ends in a romantic dinner where she proposes at the end. Mind you...she was 18, he was 16, and they'd only been dating a few months. \n\nNot long after that, the GM finally up and said that the game was being put on indefinite hold due to burnout. Others pointed out to the Kitsune player that it was their fault due to wanting to play so much. When Kitsune wasn't present, Fae and I expressed to the GM more than once that we felt like the game kept going back around to Kitsune in some fashion, often focusing on Kitsune's sexcapades. \n\nAnd that is how one player ruined it for everyone. We dont' talk to Kitsune anymore...other games were attempted with Kitsune, but Kitsune became hyper obsessed with other things once that game was done and barely spoke to us, eventually inventing a reason that wasn't true to quit talking to most of us and block us from everything.",

At some points in the story all the characters get together and their stories/plotlines intertwine.\n\nThis allows for a lot of action to happen at once, but it has one problem.\n\nBecause of quarantine everyone has had more free time and has been able to reply at least a few times every day, but despite all the free time one friend cannot be bothered to write the replies that take 15 minutes to type out (10-20 minute replies is our preferred style most of the time). They seemingly have no motivation to do it and now that quarantine is slowly going away real life duties are coming back.\n\nScenes that would take the group a few days to finish have now taken a whole month and two of the five people have been completely blocked from roleplaying because of these slow replies. It has been like this with this friend for much longer though.\n\nWe've had countless discussions about speeding this up with no real solution, which is why this is marked as vent.\nIt is simply frustrating, but I'm not willing to give up on the story over this..I just like the characters too much.",

            "selftext": "This gets said like every other post in here, but: Being an admin  REALLY is a thankless job.\n\nGonna keep this short and sweet because I don't have any specific big grievances, just a conglomeration of small ones turning into what the kids call \"feelings hurty.\" \n\nAdmins, I'm sure this is your experience too: You run a discord group. Most of your players are lovely and talented. Every now and then there's some drama, but you and your co-admins are good at nipping that in the bud. You've put a lot of effort into the Lore of your server, yes, but there's also all the subtle, often unseen work that goes into running a truly fun server: Encouraging interactions, discouraging cliques, helping people write distinct character sheets so that they don't step on the toes of similar characters, poking people privately when they've been slacking on their threads with other players, and even, in my case, setting up an obligatory feedback system that keeps people engaged with each other's writing. Everyone loves it. Now, I don't want to diss my players. They all tell us every now and then that we're doing a good job,  and that it's probably the best server they've ever been on.\n\nThe bummer is that while I am working on keeping everyone happy, engaged, and making sure everyone gets a second or two in the spotlight, my characters just... don't. Like, my characters are good, my writing is good, I'm one of the most pro-active writers in that I often don't mind starting plotlines, writing starters, having my characters enter awkward situations to create shenanigans for everyone else, having my characters be WRONG in arguments sometimes, etc. \n\nI think, if i'm allowed to attempt objectively, that I'm a damn good writer. The other three co-admins agree. I set an example when it comes to complimenting and lifting other players up (gassing them up, basically lol), leave comments on everyone's writing, follow other character's plotlines, etc... But players just Will Not Do The Same With Me! \n\n It feels that by both 1) being the owner and 2) being a proactive player people get... Intimidated, or resentful...? I've felt the resentful/jealous vibe way strongly from writers who have since dropped out, which is insane to me because, like, I'm barely getting any compliments... This is going to sound awful, but it feels like by being Too Good, people don't think I should be told that I am Good. Which sounds like what a crazy egomaniacal person would say, but I promise, truly promise that I'm not this far up my ass. I just want to have fun with my writers and get reciprocity when it comes to lifting characters up and letting them have a moment in the spotlight. I think by being proactive and constantly stirring the server up to get activity, other players feel like I am already getting too much attention. \n\nIt becomes this kind of unspoken, backhanded southern politeness kind of thing: People who do not actively seek to start shit get compliments because they aren't \"looking for it\", and people who are proactive are ignored because... It gets interpreted as attention seeking?\n\n Is this petty? Yes. I do so much work for this server and legitimately care about my players, but I feel like THEY feel like because I already play such a big role in the server, I shouldn't have my ego stroked. I feel like they feel like by doing all this OOC and IC work, I'm already in the spotlight \"too much.\" Which just feels SO ungrateful... I think the lesson here is: Admins Have Feelings Too, Please Compliment Us and Our Characters! \n\nLike yes, I love running a server, but lets be damn clear: I started it because I want people to pay attention to my characters too!! I lied this is neither short nor sweet.",

            "selftext": "Admittedly, I'm feeling a little pity-party ish right now. It'll pass, but bare with me, maybe?   \nAlso, obligatory English isn't my first language; I'm mostly good at it but sorry for the typos or misuses of words in advance.   \n\n\nI've had my main server for, coming up on, three years now. I've been present through all of it. Even when I'm at work, I'm still available if I'm needed for anything. At the start of the server, I had a few main sticking points I wanted to keep to.   \n\n\n\\- Full Transparency.   \nNothing pisses me off more as a player than when I'm in a server where half the mechanics are \"randomly selected\" in a channel only the Staff can see, so for all I know - they're tilting the game in their favour.   \n\n\n\\- No Cliques.  \nI'd been edged out of enough stories by cliques to know how shitty it is when you're doing your best and you just want to write but no one will give you a chance because they only want to play with the people they already know.  \n\n\n\\- Keep to the Vision.   \nIt was a story I'd been wanting to right for 8 years by the time I launched it on Discord. I had tried it out on other platforms before, and I let players have so much say that by two months in, it was nothing like what we started with and my muse was gone.   \n\n\nSo I went in. I built the bones and then started building the world from there. It's a magic school RP with a heavy focus on a plot that revolves around political dissonance because the actual end game is supposed to be three wars back to back. But people would just read \"magic\" and \"school\" despite the lore saying in multiple places that it's a violent game.   \n\n\nWe'd get the edgelords, because they're everywhere. We'd get the stuttering soft types who were just their to wear short plaid skirts and hope Senpai noticed them. As the story grew, the lore kept those out and left my team and I to handle our actual players with care. Every arc was talked about at length so players knew what they needed to do. Even if an arc didn't pan out, it would blossom into another aspect of the story.   \n\n\nIt was amazing to see. For all the minor bad times through the years, I can honestly say that I look back on my time with the server with fondness and pride over what we've built. The writing is phenomenal. Most of the writers can write circles around me, so it makes me better just being in a scene with them. We don't have the egos of elitists flexing purple prose that's 90% irrelevant fluff. We have mostly novella writers in the server, but every last bit of their posts are actionable content and I'm consistently floored by how great they all are. I love my server, I love my players.   \n\n\nBut the story's changed. It's been almost 3 years, yeah? Change is inevitable. We're getting closer and closer to the war portions of the plot. We adjust our adverts, the lore shows all of this, for the most part it's not a problem. We outline in numerous places that if you want something new canonized or approved, it can happen, you just need to follow the steps that are outlined for everyone to see at any time, and our DMs are always open to help explain.   \n\n\nIt's hard, sure, but it's not impossible. We've had people who come in, start working on an arc, then leave and a bunch of other players are left high and dry too. We have a process now that prevents that. If people want something, they work for it. People who put in the time to work for it tend to stay because now they have a stake in the story, they're part of the lore being built as we go. People who don't want to work for it aren't going to last anyway, aren't our demographic, we wish them the very best in one of the other 10k magic school RPs out there.   \n\n\nRecently, we got this guy in the server. He's an absolute sweetheart, but his character doesn't fit. He was warned numerous times about why this character might not have a good time in the server before he was approved. He swore that he understood the premise.   \n\n\nNow, a month later, I've gotten screen shots from another staff member where he's expressing that he feels like all his ideas are shot down. I feel like I should be used to players who approach things with the smaller \"me only\" mentality, but it shook me because this one in particular is a genuinely nice person. The main issue with him is that despite expressing that he understood the premise, he made this very happy-go-lucky type of character that doesn't fit in a story about mages who are on the brink of a war because their governing class doesn't give a shit about its people.   \n\n\nHe complained that only those with trauma are getting any air time, but that's because those people have been here, building their stories. War comes, trauma ensues. It would be meta to have a character who has watched his family and friends all die and is still just happily whistling and skipping along through life. He insists on the character being a pacifist, which is fine and we can absolutely build around that character, but he's basically made this character completely innocent and unaware of what's actually happening in the world, and that's a problem.   \n\n\nI want him to have fun and be able to write with us, but at the same time, it feels like the only way for that to happen would be to undo 3 years of hard work and story building just so he can play Mr. Popular Pupper.   \n\n\nOn top of all that, he's telling my Mods that I'm scary because I vetoed two of his ideas (both of with have had written lore outlined to show why they're psychically impossible long before he got to the server). He's internalizing all of it to feel like it's something I'm doing to him. He thinks I hate him, and in knowing that, I feel like I've failed him. I can't think of how to make this right though without allowing something that will break lore and derail the story. I'm honestly lost, and a little heart broken. I want my players to know they can always talk to me about anything, that I'm here and available for brainstorming, that I'll work with them as much as I can to help their ideas grow. That he isn't feeling any of that is a rough pill to swallow. That any of my players can think I'm tilting the game just to be petty when I've bent over backward for them for longer than most servers last, I'm wondering if it's worth it to keep going.",

It happened not long ago, not on that platform though.\n\nI was searching for someone with whom I'll be able to rp about age regression, (which is when someone regress mentally as a coping mechanism to things like PTSD, depression, anxiety and other mental problems or even for other things, like just enjoying the feeling of regressing).\n\nSince it was the first time someone hit me up for a context like that, with nearly no smut implied in it (Contrary to popular belief, age regression is NOT a kink or even sex related), I was happy. Even the guy seemed like cool and great to rp with, asking if everything was okay, that it will not contain smut since I wasn't comfortable with it in that context etc.. to finally r*pe my OC after drugging him. Ir immediately turned my excitement off. Like, it was really not what he told me, and what we agreed on.\n\nYeah, it was a bad experience. And after that I stopped rp with that person.",

I'm not sure if this is really a 'bad rper' story but I'm not too sure where else to share this, which started only a few minutes ago, so apologies if this isn't the right place to share this. Anyways!\n\nSo, someone added me as a friend on Discord, and I accepted. Straight away, they send a message saying 'hey!', I respond with a friendly 'hi!', and the other person then says they're a fan of Supergirl, the CW show, and that they are a roleplayer. I'm like, cool! I love Supergirl, my icon on Discord is of my favourite character, Winn Schott.\n\nI ask if they would like to roleplay, and they agree; then, they ask if I'm caught up on the show - which is fair enough when roleplaying a show, you don't want to be giving away any spoilers. I respond, saying that I only have the two or three latest episodes to watch.\n\nThen? They basically start quizzing me! Sending a screencap of a scene from a recent episode, asking what episode it's from, as if I'm going to remember every scene from every single episode, then asking if I can describe what's happening in the photo, but I assume they can also see what the image is, so I don't really know why they're asking this. I understand someone wanting to check if their potential roleplay is caught up on the material, but this seems a little excessive to me.\n\nI didn't sign up to take a quiz, I just asked if they wanted to roleplay! How can I tell them I'm not taking a quiz just to to roleplay? I don't want to sound mean, or come off as harsh, and I'm sure if I do they'll assume I was lying to them, which I'm not.\n\nThank you in advance for any help!",

            "selftext": "I'll try to keep this as short as possible! \n\nSo I was part of a roleplay server. I was there when it was just a website, I was there to be promoted to admin to help out, I was there when it became a Discord server. \n\nSo, there was a group of women in this server who ran together as a pack. They were notorious for doing the casual bullying; one of them would make a snarky joke, then follow it up with \"jk jk\" and the others would pile on with overtly fake compliments to try and offset the slap to the face and, sometimes, even those were a backhanded compliment. \n\nSo there was an artist in our server who decided to draw one of her friends, who was also the owner of the server. Before I continue, I should state that this poor individual was nothing but kind and selfless and received nothing but verbal abuse the entire time she was in the group. So she drew up a picture of what she imagined the server owner looked like and had prefaced it by saying she knew the owner had big boobs, as the others had mentioned it before. She presented the drawing, which did indeed depict a busty woman. \n\nWell these bullies go off on this poor girl. They start body shaming her, they start telling her she's a bad artist (she's been featured in a gallery twice so...), they demanded she apologize and quit fatshaming the owner, etc etc. I didn't understand any of this at all since the figure portrayed wasn't fat at all, and it wasn't possible to determine the weight of teh figure considering the drawing was only from the chest up. The poor artist left the server entirely and these jerks were happily celebrating and stuff. A week or so later, they brought it up again and started talking crap about the artist again, despite her not being there. Well they got me in on it and when i said I was just there to do the admin work, not to provide my opinion on anything, they got mad at me for not being present to defend the owner before. I told them I'm a full time ER nurse and I have more pressing, and in some cases literally life-or-death, matters to attend to than a roleplay server. They were incessant about it and even started DMing me individually. \n\nI finally quit the server and I've been warning my other RP friends away from that server entirely.",

            "selftext": "Seriously. I personally don't care to roleplay this kind of stuff, especially with someone I hardly know. If it was a friend, I'd feel more comfortable with it. But what confuses me is how people are so cozy with this aspect of roleplay with a total stranger that could be a creep behind a keyboard. I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on this? How do some of you do these kinds of things without a second thought?\n\nTo suit the topic of this subreddit, I have had people who basically dropped me because I wouldn't roleplay smut. A plot I worked so hard on just because you want to write porn. Why don't I like this stuff you ask? Not only does it make me uncomfortable when it's with a stranger as I stated above, including my lack of experience, but also being that I think it adds little to the story. And some people want full-blown erotic scenes that go into immense detail. I'm not spending twelve or twenty replies writing about sex. I don't see the appeal in it and it can also kill the pace of the roleplay. There are other ways to express the quality of the sex in a romance through dialogue and discussing with your partner what your characters like. \n\nThe next reason I do not enjoy it is that people (or their characters or both) have different tastes. It's hard enough that some roleplayers don't suit me, whether it's their grammar level, their level of description, and the ability to keep me hooked by contributing to the plot. Then the chemistry isn't there when it comes to the naughty scenes and everything falls. \n\nAnyway, rant over. I'd like to hear people's honest thoughts on this subject.",

We knew since it was a fandom rp not alot of people would be intrested and we had bios for all the characters and a wiki for the story witch was complex so we were fine with answering any questions\n\nSo we find two people for the open roles but...they kept breaking the rules of the world but we pointed it out and kept going. The BIG problem was when they went to do a smut scene it pm which was fine. What wasn't is that they didnt respond in the group rp for a week and when they did they had a son with them. The rp ended there\n\nWe decided when talking on the phone to add a third character with would put the oter male character into a love triange. We found more people and the two other female roles did great but the other male role got mad that my gf's role (his sister) didn't want to date him.\n\nHe refused to rp unless my gf was talking to him directly and pouted when the two other roles didnt like him. He even refused to comfort Sarah (not real or the charcters name) when she was sobbing my character had to do it. He also seemed to hate me with a passion in the OOC chat making passive aggressive statements. We broke off of that rp because we just couldn't deal with it.\n\nOur third and final attempt we had another guy who wanted his character's sister in love with him but he seemed alright when we said no. But then he decided to have on explicit smut scene with one of the girls in the love triangle. We made it clear and smut scenes please take it to pm because how do the other rps reply to that.\n\nThanks for letting me rant and TLDR Don't do a group rp with people with sibling complexs",

            "selftext": "So basically, I\u2019m a part of a rp server with friends. I brought my OCs and it was fine and dandy at first. I got a ton of development for them in that I\u2019m really proud of, decided to ship my ocs with each other and write drabbles for them, fun stuff. \n\nOther muns have done the same with their muses... But now near the end of the game here\u2019s where the problems began to set in for me.\n\nI had made a ship with someone and we\u2019d joke a little. I\u2019ll call this character V.\n\nV and my one side OC aren\u2019t canonly together but we\u2019d talk about the potential about them interacting and the potential of them in a shipping sense. Especially since my side OC works with V.\n\nWe had a few dm threads of my side OC texting V, I had then tried to initiate a written out thread where we could have them interact proper and I wanted to make it a drabble for the  IC story. They never replied to the message and just full on ignored me.\n\nThen two other people start throwing their ocs at V. I\u2019ll call these OCs B and F.\n\nWhen I would mention my OC and V, theyd always butt in and talk about B, F, and V. The V mun seemed more on board with them and then they all eventually just started talking about their OCs and stopped caring about my OC at all. Then I learned they made a server for their ship to interact and saw a posted of screenshot of... You guessed it. V interacting in full with them. More than they did for my side oc.\n\nIt hurt pretty badly, especially when my interactions with V-mun already felt one sided as is.\n\nNow the muse who has B is shipping their main muse T with every fucking muse in the series. \n\nIt didn\u2019t bug me at first since I liked T. I was okay with the little jokes we\u2019d made about shipping my OC together with T and hey, my main OC and T could have potential. But they never seemed to properly want to develop the main OC and T either. \n\nBut now they\u2019re genuinely trying to ship with EVERY character. Even a character who doesn\u2019t fit together with them personality wise and even a character T literally viewed as a sibling throughout the rp series. Not even in the whole EdWin way where Ed\u2019s using it to deny his feelings for Winry, but like a literal sibling. \n\nIt\u2019s just really unfair? Especially when another mun was happily talking about their ship with someone else and T literally butt in joking about a ship between Mun\u2019s muse and T. T is also canonly together with TWO MUSES... I don\u2019t get why they need so many partners. It\u2019s even more weird when in canon they literally can\u2019t feel love without aid.  \n\nSo why would they love so many characters at one time? \n\nThe servers also giving off a clique vibe because all of it is just talking about RP various ships between B/T-mun, and F-mun or the mun part of T\u2019s canon ship P-mun. \n\nIt\u2019s just gotten so exhausting and I don\u2019t even know how to go about this without sounding like a douche to my friends so I just muted it for the time being. I cant confront the admins about it either since they\u2019re super on board with this and Buddy Buddy with all of them. Even muting the server doesn\u2019t do anything because every time I check it in bursts it\u2019s still the same thing going on\nSo I\u2019m staying inactive for the time being. I don\u2019t even know if I want to join the next server they\u2019re making anymore because I fear it\u2019ll be the same exact thing.",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, I\u2019m on my phone, so apologies for spelling/formatting errors..\n\nSo this is more me just... Being so tired of the past few days.\n\nOn Deviantart, I was approached by someone who wanted to RP. However, they didn\u2019t do the normal thing of replying under one of my Roleplay ads or sending a Note. They asked if they could introduce themselves. I said yes, asked them to take it to Notes.... Best idea of the night.\n\n*The person sent me a maybe 100-fandom long list with a thoroughly brief (maybe a sentence) introduction of themselves.* Why was this annoying? Because they wanted to see if we share any fandoms, and my ads on Deviantart always list the fandoms I\u2019m looking for... Several of which were in their mega-list. Their introduction said they roleplayed usually using autistic characters/incontinence (the inability to properly control one\u2019s bladder). I let them down lightly because clearly they never read any of my ads, for one, and for another, they may have been autistic and I didn\u2019t want to be rude... Also the fact that their initial message, \u2018May I introduce myself\u2019 was under a piece of art I did and *in no way* prepared me for the mega-Note I got about RP\u2019ing.\n\nThen yesterday, I accidentally led someone on. Allow me to explain... They sent a message based on one of my ads, and it was nearly one in the morning (I was sleeeeeepy from melatonin). I noticed they didn\u2019t send the ad passcode (something I use as a shield against those who don\u2019t read Roleplay ads all the way through). Being sleepy, I just said I\u2019d get back to them the next day and set up a Discord server for them.\n\nWell, when I woke up, I realized my mistake. I was busy in the morning with college so I waited until after classes (and when I remembered) to message the person, saying I was sorry, but they never sent in a passcode, and that made me uncomfortable. They sent me a message saying they forgot, sent the passcode, but by then I was worried. I told them no, wished them good luck on their RP journey to find a partner, apologized for leading them on, and moved on with my day.\n\nThey responded with \u2018right now, really\u2019 or something along those lines.- We hadn\u2019t set up characters beyond who their OC would be with, and I had been put off when they claimed their OC\u2019s trauma was \u2018more severe\u2019 than another character\u2019s trauma.- Not sure if they meant physical or emotional, but I hold trauma to be emotionally more damaging, and pain (in my mind) shouldn\u2019t be a contest, but they still insisted. I once more wished them luck and moved on with my day. Then...\n\nThey said it was B. S. that I did that to them, of which I\u2019ve been questioning ever since. I blocked them when they sent that. All day I\u2019ve been wondering if it was rude of me to react as I did, but whether it was or not, the damage has already been done.\n\nAnd then, just more general... I\u2019ve made several Roleplay ads over the past few months, and maybe, *maybe*, I\u2019ll get someone who sends in the passcode once per post. I don\u2019t respond to people who don\u2019t send in the passcode because *who knows* how much of the post they\u2019ve actually read, and usually, said people quickly reveal that they have read zero/close to zero of my post outside of the list of fandoms I include in each one.\n\nJust... Annoys me so much at this point. I\u2019ve had people send me initial messages (without passcodes) that show they didn\u2019t read my post at all (\u201cHi can you roleplay in (insert fandom not listed here)?\u201d or \u201cCan you play (Canon character when I specifically stated I Roleplay as OCs or double)?\u201d). Even more annoying is people who claim they aren\u2019t there for smut, then want me to Roleplay a character as being \u2018hella thicc\u2019 which I am horrendously uncomfortable with doing. This. Is a hobby.... About.... *READING*.... For heaven\u2019s sake...\n\nI love roleplaying, I really, really do- and I hope to find more partners in the future, but hot dang as of late it\u2019s been chaos.- My best luck has been on Tumblr, but I have met a few good partners through Reddit and Deviantart, as well.\n\nThanks for letting me get my annoyances, anxieties, etc., out... Ya\u2019ll have a good day/night/whatever it is where you are. I\u2019m going to take some melatonin... And pass out.",

We talk for a minute about characters and story and whatever and they ask about my characters gender because they were into men.\n\nI had specified late in the ad that my character is trans female, and I so I told them again that it was trans female.\n\nThey were confused, not being able to tell the difference between trans boy and trans girl (which is fine but is maybe possibly an indication of young age). I told them what the difference was and they said that they wanted it to be full boy. \n\nI thought about it for a long time and then told them I would think about it. The gender thing doesn't even matter to me as much as the fact that they didn't seem to read my ad all the way and they also stuttered in OOC talk which seems like red flags to me.\n\nAre these red flags and should I drop them?",

            "selftext": "TLDR: Shitty admin did whatever she wanted and allowed constant drama and issues because \"friends\", other admins didn't get a say. I left with a bunch of annoyed roleplayers and we're working on our own thing.\n\n\n\nA fantasy group I was a part of within an MMO (said group shut down because the admin wasn't satisfied with her own shoddy handiwork) was a... For lack of a better term, painful experience. I was brought in as staff as well as a writer because I figured I had the time and experience, why not use it.\n\nShe decided not to do applications which, alright, I get that. It can be a long and laborious process. This ended badly though, with hardly any character vetting, no outfit rules outside of \"nothing modern\", and hardly any rules about how to actually write.\n\nI'm not sure what she was trying to achieve but we ended up with edgelord nobility posting fucked up things to get a rise out of players IC while never actually interacting with anyone in group RP, OP centaurs trying to be invincible warrior gods, grammar so poorly constructed it made Google Translate look competent, and a toxic community that pulled everything down.\n\nThat edgelord noble? More than happy to break a story so that he can dig up fresh graves, claim slaves (which were banned IC and OOC, so I'm not sure where he was going with this), and outright ignore any posts that didn't directly mention him. He's the only person I've ever seen enter a battlefield, draw his sword, then go on a whole soliloquy about how he wants to get his own ship without even fighting. Call him out? His girlfriend who's on the admin team will cry about it and say he's just forgetful. He played a character with power IC, a writer with that kind of IC responsibility should try to actually be competent and follow the rules.\n\nA player frequently hung around my character purely because she found him attractive OOC, and sent me her godawful dream fantasy of him assaulting her character like it was nothing. Reported to the lead admin and she just shrugged it off saying \"well it didn't happen IC\". That's beside the point? I'd go into detail but the things she sent me made me feel physically sick. That's never okay.\n\nAnd god, the admin! She adopted two teenagers IC, pretended to spoil them for a bit, and then became the most insufferable, overbearing godmode mother I've ever seen. They couldn't get injured, they couldn't get attacked, they couldn't do anything without her say and she ended up controlling them. Thankfully the pair got tired of this nonsense and left her. She outright banned exes and old friends and spewed lies about them across the group which, when they added me as friends, were quickly debunked.\n\nAnother member of the group wrote up a whole list of laws IC, based on real world documents. I helped her through the whole thing and we were proud of it. The admin not only claimed she wrote it and that it took her days, but outright called it stupid when I told her that she couldn't just claim someone else's work.\n\nAt one point there was a writer who was genuinely obsessed with her, causing drama IC and OOC to get her attention, treating other writers like shit and crying that she's the victim, it took months for her to finally get banned because the admin was sweet on her. \"Aw it's fine, she listens to what I say because she has a big crush on me\".\n\nShe pushed away good writers in favor of her friends and online family, allowing them to do whatever they wanted, even if it meant breaking the rules and lore. If anyone dared to speak up? She'd claim we were harassing her and that we were making her upset and sad, log out, then demand an apology when she got back on. She outright told me that because I value morals and honesty over her opinions that I can't be trusted. She'd even guilt people over not attending her events, knowing that other timezones exist in the world and not everyone can attend.\n\nIt reached a point where so many good players left that she decided she would shut down the group. The public announcement was that it was due to stress and the whole Covid issue making her uncomfortable. That she couldn't keep the group going under such a stressful time.\n\nIn the staff chat it was because she didn't like that she didn't get as many players as other groups and decided she was shutting down her group to join another and copy what they were doing.\n\nNeedless to say, I've made my own group with those who left because of her. We're still working on the lore together, but at least we're happy.\n\n\n\nIf you read this, thanks for getting to the end. It's massive weight off my shoulders knowing that hellhole got shut down.",

            "selftext": "My profile states that I'll design my character according to what my partner wants IF they want that.  It's not that I'm trying to foist work off on them; I am perfectly capable of designing my own characters, but I like to play just about anything and if we're doing a romance, why not let them pick my characteristics?\n\nOn several occassions when I told my partner they could help design my character if they wanted, their demeanor instantly changed.  Suddenly, they have no desire to talk about the plot, and they send me heaps of pics - always from e621 (porn site) of \"venus\" body type women with huge tits bursting out of their shirts.  \n\nJust to be clear, I have no problem with porn or nude pics, but it's just irritating to me that these types of people never have tasteful art of women in armor, and they never say \"Could you play someone with a bright, bubbly personality\" or \"could you play a dominant hard-ass?\"  Their input on my character is always physical.  And they never, ever offer to let me pick anything about their character, and they usually never have art of their character aside from a single head-shot.  I don't care about faceclaims, and in fact having no interest in art is a green flag for me, but it's still a little hypocritical imo!\n\nOne person in particular enraged me because I was being incredibly accommodating, even playing a race that I usually don't like.  (Something with scales, when I prefer to play mammals) and when I asked if he could negotiate on a detail about the setting he said \"absolutely not.\"  I ended up ghosting him before the RP even got out of the planning stage..\n\nI feel like it's partly my fault because I do offer first, but I just feel like these people take a mile after given an inch.  And it's so off-putting to realize that a person cares more about what my character looks like than any other aspect of the story.",

            "selftext": "I suppose this\u2019ll be a rather odd post, my apologies in advance if it doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been RP\u2019ing on RP Amino\u2019s for about 3 years now. It\u2019s been a tough 3 years to make it a hobby to flex my writing skills, as I intended RP to be a sort of helping tool for a fan project I\u2019ve been trying to write for a while now. But, I occasionally had fun arcs and character moments with other Users.\n\n\nThough, one User that I met ages ago\u2014even befriended for half a year\u2014is just not doing me any good.\n\n\nThis User is about 24 or such at the moment. I know from past convo\u2019s that he\u2019s in the army, came from a somewhat poor place, was the youngest of his household with slivers of domestic abuse, and is now married since last year with someone he met 3-5 years ago on AminoApps himself.\n\n\nThe guy has two dead RP Amino\u2019s of his own under his belt. I was part of his first one, and the second one I\u2019ve only heard rumours about by disgruntled Users that I have occasionally chatted with. Yet, he thinks he could handle a RP Amino that\u2019s slowly being rebuild by a different User much better than them. Saying that it\u2019d be much better if it was just mechanically D&amp;D-like, people having to roll and distribute points whilst Staff is always watching them. Even though this old Amino has always been open, people being allowed to write whatever they want without Staff needing to guide them somewhere and dice making for perhaps a good gimmick OC but nothing major further.\n\n\nHis OCs are mostly underused, despite him chewing out two of my friends who tend to make and shelve OCs themselves. He mainly plays with one that can turn himself into pure gold, and other items along with it. Only lost a fight twice, and never again. He despises cliches and common tropes, calling many Users unoriginal if you have any characters even hint at one. And if your OCs don\u2019t match the genre of the RP Amino\u2019s world, he would automatically say you\u2019re a tasteless writer that should\u2019ve never entered their OCs in set world in the first place. And if your OC\u2019s aren\u2019t scientifically accurate enough, or not man enough to throw a physical punch, then he\u2019d call your OCs weak and says you never should try to fight in RP. He\u2019s made a semi-shelved joke OC from a serious monster I created myself without asking for my permission, and sees nothing wrong with his actions. Saying that he\u2019s allowed to do so with anything I create, because unlike what I make, he writes his bootlegs \u201cmore original\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d than that I ever could. I\u2019ve since then heavily objected against any other jokes he\u2019d try to pull, like making one of my OC\u2019s mirror image clones their own with near-no alterations.\n\n\nIf you use OCs are linked to fanfiction, even if it\u2019s just that they\u2019re from the same universe or just a parallel one and the rest of it is completely original, he will call you uninspired and cheap. I myself have one OC that\u2019s a fanmade variant of a popular Sci-Fi character that allows them to be rewritten in their entirety, since I try to use RP to test out my writing. Many fans make their own variant of this character as well, and use them in all sorts of RPs. That\u2019s literally the only thing directly linking my OC to fanfiction, with every other OC being my product and every monster being my own fear or nightmare. I even plan for all of those characters to get their own stories, detached from the fanfiction. Yet, I\u2019m a hack fraud for apparently having nothing that makes me original.\n\n\nHe lately also says that his way of making OCs and arcs is the only good way to do so. If your OCs are imports from other Amino\u2019s, you\u2019re automatically bad. If your OCs have a sizeable backstory, or they\u2019re in the middle of their journey with past adventures behind them, then they\u2019re bad. And if you want your OCs to go on a personal journey, with antagonists set up to oppose them by yourself or via others, and have them focus on themselves whilst also hanging around others and having fun, then you\u2019re RP\u2019ing wrong. You can\u2019t enter OCs with no real motivation to win at all costs in a tournament, according to him. You can\u2019t use story in a battle to fight, like what OCs would logically know or not know. He\u2019s a firm believer that individual Users should completely conform to the RP Amino that they\u2019re a part of, instead of having an RP Amino motivate Users to get the most out of it by allowing to impact it or giving them adventuring oppertunities.\n\n\nAnd he\u2019s personally dragged me through the mud by accusing me of being a remorseless *sociopath*. He\u2019s written an entire essay that he\u2019s forwarded to the PMs of my friends, and also strangers. Filled with raw unfiltered slander, and saying that he\u2019s an expert on it and says the truth, despite not being remotely close to a field that allows you to play psychiatrist. Excluding me from VC events in the OOC, excluding me from public arcs and adventures, motivating others to exclude me from RPs and stop messaging me if they want to \u201cnot be hurt\u201d by me. Says that all my second chances given to another User to try and become a better writer have failed because I\u2019m a bad person. That all their ranting about me being a popular User being stupid is justified.\n\n\nNow, in OOCs and chats that don\u2019t involve me trying to chat with him, he\u2019s always butting in and trying to seemingly take jabs at me. If I get to the point of trying to ask him to stop, or if it gets too bad and I put out how I think of him, he subtly threatens to repeat his whole *sociopath* thing and get me excluded again. Perhaps even banned.\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people just keep cheering him on, whilst I get criticized into the ground and torn to shreds for my beliefs. He tears other Users to bits as well, and they just take it for granted.\n\n\n*I just don\u2019t know anymore.*\n\n\nI\u2019ve had a really rough 3 years, online and IRL. I\u2019ve only become 18[F] as of this year, with no real future in sight. I might not live in poverty, nor share the house with more than four, but I know I might have issues that I haven\u2019t seen a psychiatrist about. Younger sibling favoritism, very frequent verbal and the semi-common threat of physical abuse by my narcissistic mother, extreme domestic violence between my parents that once resulting in the cops coming over into a bloody house, and having been locked put of the house along with my father and sister when I was still 17 this year. A neighborhood boy has left a deep scar when I was 9, and throughout the entirety of my life I\u2019ve been scolded for being an ugly, overemotional mess who\u2019s got not a single bone in their body.\n\n\nSo I might just be the problem as well, if I\u2019m alike my own mother.\n\n\nI\u2019ve pulled one very bad unplanned pseudo-breakup prank on the Amino once, which nearly nobody liked. It could explain as why they think I\u2019m manipulative. I\u2019ve gotten extremely upset when one of my prison break arcs was hijacked and then DM\u2019ed by the problem User without asking for permission, notes, and having been told that \u201cit\u2019s more fun to everyone this way.\u201d\n\n\nWhilst I\u2019ve accused the User of turning me into a strawman in the past, he\u2019s recently said that I\u2019m making a strawman out of him.\n\n\n*So... I really just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all my fault for feeling so miserable in regards to RP.*\n\n\nAm I the toxic one? Do I deserve to be torn to shreds? Am I RP\u2019ing wrong? Am I being a bad User myself? Should I never hold a Staff position? Am I mentally ill at the detriment of others\u2019 well-being? Not allowed around others?",
