I calmly confronted them and they admitted to throwing out random numbers for their age, but they promised they were 18+. I can understand anonymity and such with roleplaying, but should I be concerned? I'm very careful about making sure I'm roleplaying with folks of age.",

I have always been a writer, and RP is one of the main ways I can practice and explore it while also interacting with others and gaining different writing perspectives, but I cannot deal with the downside anymore. I wont bore you with the details of my current RP, it is a standard \"Si-fi action adventure romance\" 1x1 story that I do on twitter DMs, but that doesn't really matter. What does matter is that while I love the story, and my partners contribution to it I cannot deal with the social anxiety it brings me. Let me be more specific. I do fast paced RP, 3-4 lines, quick back and forth, keeping the story moving at a nice pace and gives the writers less time to overthink responses, at first my partner was all about this style of roleplay, we would message back and forth for hours, and it would be great, but lately that has changed, randomly they will drop out, not saying \"Hey gotta go eat dinner\" or \"Hey sorry gotta go do yadda yadda\" they just disappear, then they will show back up hours later or the next day and pick up, their usual response time use to be 5-10 mins give or take, now its anywhere from 5mins-16hours, this wouldn't be a problem if it was a novella style RP but like I said, its not. The worst part is half the time I will see them read my message, then not respond, but still be active. All of this ends up making me think they didn't like something my OC did or said, and instead of just telling me, they just leave. And I cant bring myself to bring it up to them, I'm afraid Ill look like a clingy weirdo and they'll ditch me, thus losing the RP entirely. Some advice on how to deal with this would be helpful, if anyone else has this problem.",

            "selftext": "Hi all,\nNeed a bit of a rant, and hopefully this post will explain why.\n\nSo I met this individual on reddit and we moved to discord to set up a role play. By all accounts this guy was pretty nice. He had specific rules he wanted his partners to follow. The main one here being his insistence on a 48 hour due date on responses unless otherwise advised in advance. Seems fairly innocent so I agreed (I had very few priorities at the time so I figured I\u2019d have plenty of time to devote to the role play). Skip forward to a couple months later, and I now have an almost full time job, full time classes, and family to take care of. As we all know, life gets busy and checking your online stuff doesn\u2019t always happen daily. I\u2019d accidentally neglected to tell this guy that I couldn\u2019t be responsive since I was quite busy with adapting to a new schedule. First time, I get a freebie. \n\nThen out of the blue, he messages messages me that he thinks it won\u2019t work out since I\u2019m not following his rules that I had agreed to. I apologize profusely and admit I\u2019ve been busy and I say that I won\u2019t ask for a second chance and I agree to close it up. I apologize for the inconvenience and for annoying him with it, and he says he\u2019s not annoyed, just disappointed and leaves.\n\nShould have left it there, but I sent him a message on reddit to apologize one last time and wish him well in role play and in real life. THIS is where the bad comes in. He accuses me of acting like an a**hole and calling me out for wasting his time and ruining his role playing experience. He says that I\u2019ve been posting for new role plays and ignoring his. Granted I had posted for role plays, nothing had come from them and I\u2019d declined almost all those who had shown interest. I had had too much to manage and couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nSo I suppose my issue is with role players who are so entitled to think that their role play partners should be fully and entirely dedicated to them and their little story. People get busy, circumstances change, and role play is only an imitation of life. Nobody should be expected to prioritize the fictional narrative of fictional characters above their own busy lives. \n\nShould I have told him things were changing and I needed more response time? Yes. Was I too busy and too caught up in many different things to be in the right headspace to think to tell him? YES.\n\nRant over. Thanks for listening. Feel free to comment your opinions, but I\u2019m not gonna argue with people (those who may disagrees with me)",

Problem is, the person I\u2019m roleplaying with has this character who REALLY doesn\u2019t like mine. Like REALLY doesn\u2019t. In fact, their character absolutely hates them and wants to beat them up in an unfair fight. \n\n(For reference, their MAIN character is a telekinetic, and can predict moves and see into the future. She wants to use her powers to find this dude and beat him up really badly)\n\nSee, this is alright. I like a good fight. I don\u2019t mind it. But their character wants to cheat, and continuously talks about how she can\u2019t WAIT to mess my character up.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering. What should I do? Like, my character is kinda rough. And I like brash characters who turn into good guys near the end. But it seems like my roleplaying partner doesn\u2019t like him at all.\n\nShould I revise him? Or what? I just hate the idea of a roleplaying partner secretly hating my characters or not liking them",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR; - I break up with a manipulative asshole called 'L'. He talks shit about me behind my back causing people to stop rping with me. Two months later, L puts his blog on hiatus and a brand new rp blog follows me. This new blog and I rp for a few months until I get sick and put *my* blog on hiatus. This is the exact same day, L reopens his blog, and the new person I was rping with stops writing on their blog.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier this year, I had to part ways with a writing partner I've had for almost two years. I had no complaints about his writing, rather, it was the damn microaggressions and manipulation he kept using on me that did me in. After **multiple** attempts of trying to talk out the issue with him, which, only made him gaslight the fuck out of me,  I told him I couldn't do this anymore then blocked him on everything.\n\nA few days later I began noticing that every mutual writing partner we had would suddenly stop responding to my rp's with them and a few of those partners had blocked me. I would search for new writing partners, plot with them, work out an entire universe with them, and after a few responses to our rp's, they'd drop me, too. There was no doubt in my mind that 'L' (I won't use his real name in case he frequents these boards, the last thing I need is more drama) had gotten into everyone's heads and spread rumors about me because when I was actively friends with him, he would viciously talk shit about other rp'ers to me when he had issues with them and this would usually be followed by a guilt-tripping me into blocking the person he had issues with.\n\n My suspicions were confirmed when a mutual writing partner (we'll call him 'C') who refused to stop writing with me, sent me screenshots of his conversations with L (I honestly think C hates L and only keeps being nice to him because he'd rather have him as a friend than an enemy). I didn't ask him to do this, he *willingly* sent me them because he knew I'm the type to feel terrible about dropping people and that I'd apologize to L for being 'harsh' (yeah, I'm *that* person. After a few months of blocking a manipulative asshole, I begin to feel bad that I stood up for myself and apologize) sooner or later and he really didn't want me going back to him after all he'd been doing behind my back. I was grateful for this because now I knew not to apologize.\n\nNow, L is known for making multiple rp blogs. Half the time when a new blog followed me, I wouldn't know it was him until he told me. So when a new rp account followed my writing blog two months later that had extremely similar aesthetics and writing style as him, I began to get suspicious but chalked it up to me being paranoid and continued to rp with them for a few months until my health took a turn for the worse this month and I had to put my writing blog on hiatus. \n\nI hadn't thought about L at all for a few months, (and he sure as hell was the last thing on my mind while I was sick) until C popped into my DM's to show me something 'interesting'. He said that L had put his blog on hiatus the day this new blog (We'll call the new blog M) was created. Then, the **exact day** I stepped away from my blog because of my illness, is when L reopens his blog claiming he's 'back and that he's ready to write again' and M stops posting to his blog. \n\nDo I have hard evidence that L was posing as M and stalking me? No. But could I see L doing this? Yes. Lord, people really love to think a person is dumb.",

            "selftext": "To start off, this was a post on r/dirtypenpals with a rule against asking for character pics in your post. I ask most people in private and they don\u2019t mind getting one, or letting me choose one for them.\n\nOf course, it would be unfair of me to make it a requirement so if they have a detailed description they\u2019d rather use I\u2019m 100% okay with that.\n\nCut to last night. I send the guy a reference of what my character looks like and then ask him for his. He claims his character is too specific to find a reference that matches.\n\nCurious, I ask him if it\u2019s so specific that no one on earth looks like him. I was picturing some guy with heterochromia and dyed hair.\n\nHe replied that it\u2019s so specifc he\u2019s not going to bother looking for a pic, which irked me because it came across so rude and lazy. I asked to see rhe description and this is it, word-for-word and copy-pasted. \n\n\u201cMy guy\u2019s name is Kai Mohani and he comes from one of those Pacific islands (think Moana). He\u2019s 19 and he\u2019s attending university. He\u2019s really tall, has a six pack, nice pecs, works out every day. He has a tribal tattoo on his upper left arm\n\nHe\u2019s not super hairy but he has nice chest hair and a happy trail. He\u2019s also horse hung: over 6 inches soft and 10 inches hard, super thick and uncut.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend, and just sleeps around.\u201d\n\nNothing specifc save for the tattoo and hair remark. Nothing about his facial features or hair style, nothing about his height or weight, just a generic chad description that is supposedly specific because of the ethnicity.\n\nHad he said \u201cI can\u2019t find a pic that matches it perfectly and woukd rather not use one that doesn\u2019t\u201d I would understand, but instead he acted rude and later accused me of not having enough imagination even though his description was basic at best.",

            "selftext": "Why is it so hard to just find a decent rp partner? Why is it every time I get my hopes up and look forward to the story, I get dropped or told a bunch of things which damage the only coping mechanism I have? [Warning: TL;DR post] also I'm not targeting anyone in specific, its more of \"if the shoe fits wear it\" post...\n\nSherlock Rp: RUINED\nMarvel Rp: RUINED\nHyde/Jekyll Rp: RUINED\nDoctor Who Rp: You guessed it, RUINED.\n\nOriginal stories, they're fun. But guess what, people lack creativity or they try to control your character and throw fits if things don't work their way. Any roleplay I start I have become very hesitant and lackluster, simply because people complain about too much or too little. I encourage those to take reign and lead. \n\nMy grammar isn't the best, sadly I can't help that. I have tried to improve but I can't process new information. I have severe ADHD and the public school system failed me because I couldn't learn. I was \"homeschooled\" by parents which didn't want to explain things, they expected me to figure it out on my own. I was pulled out of school right after 5th grade and I stopped learning after 5th grade. I can't catch grammatical errors or punctuation errors. Anything I know or do is self taught, sure, read this message and you'll find plenty of errors. But I'm sorry if it makes you squeamish to write with me. I mainly write on wattpad and I've got 60k reads and people comment/like them so is it just a knit pick thing?\n\nI can't rp as Canon characters for that exact reason. Or either I just suck at the personality portrayal. I just dunno what else I can do now. I want honesty, I could be having a good time and check my phone hourly or daily for updates only to be disappointed with excuses or silence. Meanwhile the partner is avoiding me or making excuses to put off roleplay. It's gotten to the point where I give up and go weeks even months without a message because anything I can get I'll take happily. \n\nI try to keep in mind one main rule; Education, Friends, Family, Jobs, Significant others, Mental health, Physical health, and Personal time all come before rp. I will work with people according to their routines. Do many other people do that? No. I can be patient and with small updates I will wait as long as you need to but this steps into different territory. People take advantage of that and use it to ghost me or avoid me and put off responding because they've lost interest and they don't want to come off as rude or harsh. There are some really good people, and I understand I'm not the best rp partner to have but be honest with me so I don't end up spiraling into depression. Broken promises and getting my hopes up looking forward to talking with you just to be disappointed and told I'm not good enough hurts.\n\nDon't tell me you're having a good time, don't tell me you're really into the story, don't make some stupid promise you can't keep, and don't lie to me. Just be honest and it would save me this feeling of not being good enough. Not only have you let me down and left me feeling so incapable of providing fun or adventure, you built up my hopes and knocked them down like Jenga. If you're not feeling it anymore, be honest. If you get busy, let me know I'll wait. If a post I make doesn't make sense, tell me I'll correct it or explain. Just stop building me up and breaking me down. \n\nDepression took everything away from me; I cant play sims or minecraft, I can't draw like I used to, I can't paint, I can't crochet..rp and writing has been the only thing to help me escape and feel better its kept me from sinking further in my depression and you bundled it up and threw it away like a metaphorical paper ball.  I'm done for a while and frankly I'm unsure I'll be able to try and write again...",

The server itself is fantastic and the admins are great but every server has a bad apple.\n\nI\u2019d made a recent ad post and gotten a hit on it. I had all of my information listed including my limits and hard limits. This person comes into my dms with a pretty cool plot except one detail. They included one of my hard limits in it. \n\nNow the hard limit was/is impregnation and anything dealing with children. I have this limit for a very specific reason that is extremely personal. Now I made it very clear to them that it was listed as a hard limit for a reason and that it was non-negotiable. \n\nLong story short, they kept pushing me about it even though I kept telling them no. It just got so bad to the point where it was starting to emotionally effect me because, as said before, it\u2019s a hard limit for personal reasons. \n\nI did end up banning this person but not before they tried manipulating and guilting me into allowing them to use that in the rp. \n\nIt was an emotional night after blocking this person on the discord platform and I have to say that was probably one of my worst encounters with someone on discord.\n\nY\u2019all please respect peoples limits. Even if you think it\u2019s \u2018ridiculous\u2019, respect it, please. People have these limits for a reason. \n\nMoral of the story: Don\u2019t be a d*ck.",

            "selftext": "I've wanted to get back into RPing in a game ever since I left WoW RP due to similar reasons as this. So, I ask around and am told there is a lot of RP that is great and everyone is chill. Great! Download the game and spend thr next month grinding to get things for my character for clothing and weapons. Finally have it all annnd no RP. No one wants to even touch my character because they are an Ordinator.\n\nSo, I join a guild hoping to get more RP. The guild seemed chill and laid back. Surprise surprise, all of that changed. The few times I can actually RP I'm stonewalled, ignored, and made to feel out side of the, you guessed it, clique. More time is given to people in the server that are in the clique while I'm ignored. So, I talk to the server owner, and am reassured this isn't the case. Give it another chance, and once again this happens. Talk about taking all of the steam out of me to develop this character and write some good drama.\n\nHeed my advice, if you are going to ESO to find RP, don't. You will probably not find it unless you're one of the cool kids. It's cliquish just like WoW and the other games out there. The game itself is fun, so I do recommend playing it for that.
