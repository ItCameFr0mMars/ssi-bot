            "selftext": "So I joined this new roleplay site recently and I tried to fix it up (Add alll my rules, ons and off, that kind of stuff.) So these are the reasons why I'm venting;\n\n1) No one wants to roleplay with me because of how my profile looks. I get it, there are some people who profile looks...questionable and can't write a single sentence even if their life depended on it but there are some that are able to write multi-para and add details to their replies. I message people who add pictures and fonts and they think they can just shit all over you because you use a normal font.\n\n2) Some guy I currently am roleplaying with haven't responded to me in 3 weeks. I'm not one to annoy anyone over how long they take to reply but this certain guy said if he was absent for a week, hit him a reply. I did, got no answer but 3 weeks which marks today, I saw him posting for new roleplay request and this seem to be the problem with all my rp partners. As soon as I take time off, I get bombarded with questions on why I'm not replying.\n\n3) smut. I'm not a hater of it, I allow it in stories also but if I say that my ratio to plot to smut is 70:30 I expect to mostly have a story rather than full blown getting down and dirty and people don't seem to understand that apparently.\n\nI would say more but I'm too pissed. If anyone know any good role-play discords or sites with no egoistical idiots  please tell me?",

            "selftext": "I'm not good at titles. TLDR, admin publicly criticized me for falling behind when I was well within the activity requiremens, banned me when I asked how I was inactive when I'd posted less than two weeks ago and how I'd ignored her when I had no messages from her, then banned about half the remaining members to \"clean up\" the site\n\nThis happened a couple years ago and I'd just about forgotten about it when I ran into someone who had been in the Discord at the time and he mentioned it. For a little background, I'd been on the site for about nine months and had half a dozen characters. Then I'd gotten sick with a pretty bad case of the flu and my online presence had dropped to nothing. After about a week, I started chatting in the Discord again with the other members. \n\nThe admin of the group posted in the general channel, interrupting the ongoing conversation which stopped after her message. She told me that I'd fallen behind with one of my characters and she was going to take them away from me if I didn't post more. The site's activity requirement was one post per month and besides the last week in which I'd been sick, I'd been posting at least weekly with each character since I'd joined. I checked the character in question just to make sure and saw the last post I'd done with them was ten days ago. \n\nI replied saying I was sorry for my inactivity and I'd thought I was within the rules, and asked her to DM me about any future problems rather than putting them in the main chat. Maybe I'm old-fashioned or something, but it annoyed me that she tried to chastise me in front of the entire group rather than approaching me in private. Interrupting a conversation to criticize someone just seems dickish. \n\nShe said that she'd been forced to address my behaviour in public because I was ignoring her DMs. I explained that I'd been sick and hadn't been answering anyone's DMs. She said my excuse \"didn't count\" because I didn't tell her ahead of time. I said that I didn't have any unanswered DMs from her, and asked her to clarify how I'd ignored her and how I wasn't being active enough, saying I wanted to modify my behaviour to do better in the future. \n\nShe told me I was being combative, then blocked me, removed me from the Discord, and deleted all my accounts onsite. All righty then. I decided to contact the other members I'd been writing with to let them know I was leaving, as I didn't want them to think I'd ghosted them. I simply apologized for not being able to wrap our threads up IC. I didn't say anything about my convo with the admin, had no intention to talk shit and just wanted to cut my losses. \n\nOne person just said thanks and wished me well. The three others replied telling me they'd just gotten kicked from the site too. I'd shrugged off the admin's weird behaviour towards me but hearing that three of my thread partners got kicked with me made me wonder what was going on. Between the four of us, we had most of the site's members in our friends lists. We managed to get in touch with almost all them by the end of the day and get some information. \n\nAs it turned out, the admin went on a ban rampage (banpage?) and removed about half of the people in the Discord, including all of the members who had joined in the past two months and all but one of the guests still considering joining. One of the remaining members asked the admin what had happened. She reportedly said that some of us chose to leave and she didn't know about the rest. Only one of the banned people had a message explaining why, where the admin said they were \"trying to bring down the chat\" (they'd posted one message about some real life difficulties).\n\nThe admin reportedly made an announcement a few hours after banning us all that she'd \"cleaned up\" the site and was planning on making further changes. She then made it an invite-only site where only members who were logged in could view anything and new accounts couldn't be made. I don't know what she did after that. I assume the site ended up dying, I can't imagine she ever got new members or that the remaining ones were happy with her for getting rid of a bunch of active writers who were all playing requested characters.",

The subreddit I helped create was doing great for it first few weeks, I thought I had found good friend in the sub discord that was made. To be honest, I should have known better. The other mods wanted me gone, I didn't fit with their image. My so-called friends reported me and had me banned from my community over a rp plot disagreement. Of course the othe community mods jumped at the chance to get rid of me. I got stabbed by the people who created the subreddit with me and stabbed by writers I considered my friends. \n\nHonestly, I am heartbroken. I'm mad they called me a liar, I'm sad that I lost friends and a community I loved, and confused as to why I allowed myself to get so invested. If the mods see this or the people who aided in getting me removed from it all, I want you to know that you took away one of the few things that kept me going. I so desperately want to say that I want to see you fail, but I don't. That community was created for a reason and I don't want it to go to waste. That being said. Besides the two writing partners that stood by me and saw through all the crap, I think I'm done with rp. \n\nWhere is Alfie? Alfie's leaving, he's tired of trying to prove himself and playing the nice guy. It's time to just move on.",

RP is more or less consistent despite us all having busy lives and we\u2019re all comfortable together. There\u2019s just one problem: I am the designated man simply because I\u2019m the only person willing to play one, even as a side character. When I do make a woman, the story dies out really quickly. It\u2019s been brought up several times, but I\u2019ve basically given up on it. It\u2019s not going to happen in this group and I\u2019ve accepted it.\n\nI decided that I would try to find a new partner so I can happily play a woman, preferably with the other person playing a man just because I haven\u2019t been able to roleplay that dynamic in my normal group. I put up an ad on a couple discords looking for a medieval fantasy story.\n\nHere are the responses I\u2019ve been getting: \n\n\\-People asking if I\u2019m into some random fetish. Nothing in my ad is sexual.\n\n\\-Men wanting to make sure I\u2019m a woman in real life who are very insistent that they can in no way play with another man.  I am a woman, but I'm not touching that with a 10ft pole.\n\n\\-Some asking if I\u2019d be down to make it an FxF pairing instead. I did agree to go along with it because it\u2019s not super important to play against a man, but it didn\u2019t get far because the person had a lot of GLARING RED FLAGS as things progressed.\n\n\\-People asking if we can do the story, but they play the woman instead.\n\n\\-People outright asking to cyber.\n\nWhy is this so hard?!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI hope your RPs and searches are going well. What stories do you guys have when you're reading an RP ad or have people responding to your ad? Besides the usual incompatibilities (such as preferred genre, mediums, pairings, etc.) what are green flags that draw you to a particular ad or red flags that drive you away?\n\nFor that, I have some stories:\n\n- My ads stress that I love world building, no minors as characters and slice of life is the only genre I don't want to write. First thing they do is propose a modern-day set on our Earth, then a slice of life plot, then minors as characters. The latter is a hard limit of mine. I had to turn them down. \n\n- I've had responses to my ads that utterly butchered the English language. I don't how else to put it. I'm fine with some typos; everyone makes mistakes, but their messages were just so full of them to the point of being painful to read.\n\n- People who have absolutely no idea what they want to do. I ask them their preferences so I can suggest plots and get vague answers. It's frustrating as hell. When I propose ideas of my own, I feel as I'm walking on eggshells because I know there's a chance they'll ghost the moment they hear an idea they don't like. People who tell me that they don't like one of my proposed ideas and then work out something that works for both of us are rare. \n\nAs for ads, I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Ads that are walls of text that ramble on and on. People who specify their partner's character's personality, face claims and background. People who want to RP as themselves. Not enough information for me to work with (such as preferred pairing, preferred mediums, etc). Proposed plots/settings that are way too detailed (and very time consuming to read), with no room for someone else's contribution.\n\nProbably the toughest part is when a potential partner is perfect on paper, but I pull away because my gut feeling tells me our personalities are incompatible. RP ads don't just tell people what you're looking for and what you want in RP, they also reflect their writer's personalities. Realizing that has helped me avoid a *lot* of drama.\n\nThat said... I find it rather depressing how much time and effort it takes to find compatible partners. Sometimes I wonder if it's more about luck and patience than anything else. And reading a lot of ads. Oof.",

            "selftext": "I RP on WoW and recently there was a huge, serverwide event (100s of people) about a battle campaign. It was run like a DnD game, with /rolls, stats and health totals. If you reach 0 you are knocked out (you CAN choose for permadeath, though nobody forces you to).\n\nThe night before the big battle, my OC Red and Anne had a heart-to-heart. Red promised that if Anne died, he'd deliver the news to their family. Red and Anne also share a chronic illness and sympathize with eachother. Now, Phineas and Red know eachother, but haven't met a lot/don't know much about the other. So far, Red has a closer connection with Anne. Phineas and Red? They're brothers (this was something we discussed OOC) but neither have any idea, seeing as how we've rped them twice.\n\nThe last day of the event my character got a fatal blow and passed out. He was there with two other people he knew, and one was also K.O (Anne), but the other was still standing (injured) (Phineas) when my OC (Red) went down.\n\nThe battle ends, Red and Anne are K.O. Phineas walks right by Red to Anne, sits by her, doesn't even emote anything mentioning Red. A stranger carried Red out of the battlefield and took him back to camp so that he could see a healer. He's being tended to and comes back to, and in his groggy state he's asking where Anne is, if she came back, etc.. because the last he knew, Anne had been knocked out (she went down before he did).\n\nOOC, Phineas' player (lets call them... One) starts getting butthurt. \"Why isn't Red worried about Phineas?\"\n\n\"Well, last Red saw Anne was down and Phineas was still up\"\n\n\"Yeah well Phineas was bleeding still. just because he was out doesnt mean hes not hurt. and anyways Anne passed out behind us how could they have seen her\"\n\nAnne's player, (Two)\n\n\"Anne was out for quite a while, Red could've seen that\"\n\nOne: \"But she was behind us how could he have seen her\"\n\nMind you Anne was behind them by like, ten feet, and in line of sight if Red turned around (which he did while he was making friends with the floor.)\n\nLike... Sorry that while my OC is groggily coming to, your character, who Red at this point doesn't know as well, isn't the first name that comes from his mouth. One is an old RP buddy but now they never want to RP with me anyways, and even when they do? Their replies are lackluster and hard to reply to, and usually just \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ smiles and nods and sits\" or \"/shrug\". So... Yeah, Red and Phineas, while we've discussed they're related? That was months ago, we've rped them together twice, and no progress has been made towards them discovering that.\n\nI stopped replying to that and just carried on RPing. After One's fit, her and Two went and RPed. One and Two are a couple OOC, so I just wonder maybe if One got jealous? But either way... Holy shit. Two and I rp more together at this point so yeah, our character's are closer than mine and One's are.\n\nPhineas and Red are also something called Illidari, and basically, they're -very- tough soldiers. Anne is not one of those. So yeah, Red is more worried about Anne. He knows Phineas can take a beating. AND PHINEAS DIDN'T EVEN GIVE A SHIT RED WAS OUT COLD???? LITERALLY WASN'T EVEN GONNA RETRIEVE HIM FROM THE BATTLEFIELD. A. Stranger. Did.\n\nIt irked me so bad.\n\nAnyways, that's my rant :D",

            "selftext": "In one of my group RP servers, I currently have two characters. One male, one female.\n\nBoth of my characters have emotional baggage. The male had lost his mother at a young age and had to live with abusive grandparents for years before he escaped and ended up in an life of crime for a while before getting out of that life and basically becoming a brooding loner type with trust issues. The female was raised with an obsessive Big Game Hunter for a father before he died and she carries the guilt of taking part in that lifestyle, and also harbors an intense resentment for her mother, due to her mother leaving and her father becoming obsessive with that hobby to cope.\n\nOkay back to the point.\n\nBoth RPers wanted to RP so I had the meet my characters, one a piece. \n\nMy male went to the park to be introduced to the other member's female character, where she was playing music for NPCs and smiled at him through the crowd. She even had her character sing a Spanish song because the member knew my character was Hispanic (I wish I could say this was likely a coincidence but I've known this girl for years and she has done stuff like this often before where she would try to apply what other characters may be interested in to her own characters to catch their attention). As the conversation went on, literally basic stuff, she basically began to show a little too much familiarity with him despite not knowing him, such as teasing him lightly and giving him a nickname and inviting him out to eat. As one can tell, she's trying to lead in the direction of a ship. And she has expressed both to me and others in the group that she finds him attractive.\n\nMy girl is in a similar situation. She accidentally bumped into the member's male character on the street while she was distracted and his monologue was basically how he found her to be beautiful and was surprised she wasn't automatically afraid of him. I guess he was supposed to be intimidating or having a semi scary energy but I never got that vibe and just RPed accordingly. He also ended up asking her to join him for food with him complimenting her looks and smarts every now and then and even asking if she already has a romantic partner, which she doesn't. Again, they're just meeting a ship is being steered to.\n\nHonestly, I'm currently playing my characters at safe levels that have them being borderline bland, just because I haven't used them in a while so I'm, metaphorically, brushing off the personality rust while 'reviving' their characters. They aren't exactly the most exciting to ship with, especially off the bat, and I don't even know why they are trying to ship off the bat. I know a lot of RPers like having ships, but steering them in that direction so quickly? It's one thing if my characters were openly searching for partners or if there was a blind date subplot, but it's literally like 'here's my character that has an interest in yours after 30 seconds' with them. I didn't even discuss with them about potential relationships and they never discussed with me either. It just feels like I'm being lead through their plans since I never expressed any of my own. \n\nIt's literally making it hard to do replies because my characters are staying cordial and open to friendship but I feel like I give an inch and they take it a whole league. \n\nI really want to tell them that their advances are basically being ignored or ask them to cool it, bit I don't them to be offended or mad.",

Just run. \nNSFW WARNING TRIGGER WARNING FOR THINGS OF THE UNSAVORY KIND. \nAnd if anyone wants, I have screen shots of our conversation I dont mind sending people. \n\nSo I posted an ad to RP last night and this person responds. Not with a 'hey how are you.' Or yannow a basic introduction... just\n\nWhat are your limits. \n\nSo I peeked into their profile and what do you know. Their gallery is full of ads pertaining a certain kink involving alien bugs from a certain movie franchise. \n\nI politely tell them that I'm not interested nor did my ad state I was into what theyre into. \nProceeds to lie to me and saying that's not what theyre after. Theyre after a gore plot. I answer with \" ok what's the plot entail?\"\n\n\" you know what a chest burster is?\"\n\nHard pass. Tell them nope I'm not interested and that clearly we're not compatible. \nThis user proceeds to shame me into calling me plain jane and that I need to try something new. That I must have no takers on my ad because I'm so 'I need this I need this.'\n\nI politely tell her that my interests do not align with theirs and that there are people out there who share her kink and guilt tripping those that dont isnt their best interests. \n\nI'm sorry. But I enjoy a bit of smut but of someone clearly tells you NO, you don't shame them and guilt trip them until they comply. \nAnd if you come across this user or users like them, stand your ground and make your comforts known.",

I joined a day ago and sent in my character with very little issue, having her be the eventual medic for the team once things settle in but good God I did not expect to see goddamn Ruby Rose as a character, nor did I expect to read \"Human mixed with feline DNA\" in someone's bio. \n\nIt's not that I have issues with the characters themselves. Do what you want, y'know? But the context of the server, and the setting as a whole, is about as far from Anime as you can get and I was expecting characters to fit that \"as far from anime as you can get\" design choice. I don't get why people think that having an anime character for their reference pic somehow translates into a realistic setting,  nor do I understand why mods allow it when they know that their setting isn't supposed to be filled with catgirls and lolis and whatever other my hero academia characters that decide to rear their head.\n\nMaybe I'm just pulling a grinch move and I'm incapable of having fun anymore but to me things are fun when they make relative sense; not when there's stuff like this happening.",
