The other person is a total lame-ass when it comes to RP, both in quality and in posting frequency. I like to think that I am both a good writer and a frequent poster.\n\nAnyhow, turns out that our mutual co-writer would prefer to put the RP with me on hold and continue the scene with the bad writer because, basically, they feel like they have to put too much thought into it to RP with me.\n\nI guess the moral is to suck more. :D",

I have a thing for love stories.\n\nThe one that stood out to me was a roleplayer who decided to look into my post history.\n\nI am part of many subreddits. I am also visually impaired and have struggled before with my blindness. It is entirely separate from my hobby.\n\nHe asked to roleplay and after hashing out details he added \"And don't worry, I find blind girls cute too\" it caught me off guard.\n\nI felt upset. What did my disability have to do with roleplaying? Why did he have to dig so far down and then before I shared it with him he had to bring it out as if it was some sort of obstacle that he was so kindly overlooking?\n\nNeedless to say I did not roleplay with him.",

            "selftext": "I'm mod of a popular rp group on a popular website and through discord. The main mod had been very friendly to me previously.  She tried to help me set up my own roleplay group but she was very opinionated it was hard to find a compromise though I tried and revamped my group two times per her suggestions because she's had more experience previously. My group ended up falling through but I still stayed to help her do her groups which have been more popular. Her attitude towards me changed during this time.   \n\n\nThough previously we were always on good terms and talked a lot about our day/feeling/problems. I started to notice she would minimize my problems/needs in favor of her own. It almost felt like she made most of how I felt seem trivial or not as important. I also noticed while I tried to be helpful in her group it was never enough. My ideas were often shot down, I was made to do multiple artworks/memes most of which were not used or credit was not given.  It got worse and worse the more her group seemed to go inactive. Out of 70 members maybe 20 were overall active.   \n\n\nAlso I noticed that it felt like she was unhappy with our roleplay. Since they tend to go for male characters(Which I mostly use men)  I almost felt as though because I did not ship with her characters I was treated more coldly. She flirted with other OC's and ditched our roleplay all together  and since has not spoken to me, unless it's been in the mod chat about the group. We have two other mods one being her friend one mod has never helped and has been mostly inactive but they always seem to celebrate their minimal responses and promises to do better in chat (but they have yet to participate).  \n\n\nCurrently we are in a second opening and I feel like I am being given the silent treatment. I don't understand what I've done wrong and I am too scared to talk to her at this point because it always feels like she's telling me what I do wrong. I am trying my best to help with event planning and artwork but I just feel like I'm not good enough. What do I do? Is this my fault? I'm afraid to leave at this point because she's pretty popular on the website and I'm scared she will ruin my reputation. As when we first met she told me of multiple \"friends\" she's had problems with and how terrible they were to her. Now I'm wondering if it was actually her and not them.  They have a lot of pull in the community and I'm terrified I love to rp and would hate for people to think bad of me. What can I do? How do I get out of this?",

            "selftext": "Honestly- sorry if this title is bad, I genuinely have no idea what to title this so I'm sorry if it's the wrong kinda thing, haha. But I have to talk about this, I just have to- and I can't be the only one who has issues with this... right? So... where do I begin? It's probably gonna be all over the place, sorry for that as well.  \n\n\nImagine creating a character that you are genuinely insanely proud of- and you love them, because they are *your* character. Not anyone else's character. You wrote them, developed them from scratch, made sure they were well balanced and overall well written- you are *proud* of this character/these characters. And of course, you wanna rp with them! You wanna write them, and have chances to develop them more and have them grow-  \n\n\nAnd then, as soon as you try to rp with someone- that person practically wants to change everything.  \n\n\nI've had this happen all different ways- people want to change how my character either looks or acts, take away important things that make my character who they are- literally make them a completely different character. Now- I get that people change their characters depending on the plot or what kind of things are happening in the rp- but that's not exactly what I'm talking about. This is different-  \n\n\nI guess a lot of my characters aren't considered... attractive to people? For some of them yeah, I purposely deviate from what's considered \"conventionally attractive\", but like, are they *really that ugly to other people??* Like holy crap- personally, I draw my characters and all, I don't really use face claims... it's rare if I do, but every character I make has some sort of art tied to them- and honestly, I'm sometimes nervous to show people what they look like because I've had so many people in the past be so against my characters' looks for some reason.   \n\n\nI've once tried to use my one character, Daron, and he's I guess considerably he might be one of my more \"unattractive\" characters. I've literally had people take this character and absolutely shit on him- He's short, kind of chunky, has a weird nose and scary eyes with really long hair- and this person basically told me \"Okay, but that's horrible- this is so much better-\" And then gives me various pictures of random very buff, short hair, blonde, blue eyed guys who literally looked all the same and said \"pick from one of these\". Like no?? I don't want to do that? Am I crazy because I don't want to take my character design I put lots of effort into (and have reasons for why he looks the way he does) and throw it out the window because you want him to be what you find attractive? We weren't even doing like- a romantic rp- why did looks even matter? And why would it matter even in a romantic rp? I just don't get it man, I didn't even get to explain his character as a whole to them, they refused to rp with me because he wasn't blonde or buff or blue eyed-   \n\n\nAnd this hasn't been the only time this had happened. I've had other occasions where people have taken all my characters at some point and tied to \"fix\" them for me. Like I've seen so many random pictures of random people that people tell me I should use instead of how I have drawn them. It's just tough, I dunno- I put tons and tons of work into this stuff, and it just feels bad?   \n\n\nI've also had people change important information about them. I get if people want to change age, that is flexible- but I've literally had people take my characters who weren't like, cisgender, and then say \"uh no make them cis\"- like... I don't get why that would matter either? Like something like that can literally change so much of a characters backstory- and I've also had people try to take chunks of my character's personality to make them a \"shy uwu soft boy\"- for some reason it's always that, I dunno, it's just hard and annoying.  \n\n\nI also notice this a lot in female characters- I don't have too many female characters, I plan on making more of them- but the ones I do have, have literally been taken and shit on, too. Like, I feel like my female characters are attractive- but still, I don't think looks should be a main factor- I try to have my female characters have strong personalities and all- but lot's of people don't care about personalities, and they literally just focus on how they look. I've had my characters not fit I guess other guys \"standards\" or \"ideal types\" and have had people, once again, send me random pictures of random girls they find attractive.   \n\n\nI think that's all I'd say on it for now but- seriously- am I the only person who experiences this? How do I avoid stuff like this happening? Any advice is welcome, and I'd love to hear your stories as well.",

There\u2019s this one character in there who is just SO fucking bitchy and hypocritical.\n\nShe\u2019s supposed to be this misunderstood orphan girl who just becomes evil because of bad influences, but I can\u2019t stand her. She\u2019s a hypocrite. She tells other people not to use their powers in fight, but it\u2019s okay for her to overuse her own. She apparently can\u2019t be in pain, because when people try to fight her, she doesn\u2019t react to the pain and immediately gets back up.\n\nShe has ZERO humanity. I get she\u2019s supposed to be a cold bitch and stuff but it just seems that that\u2019s ALL her character is supposed to be. She laughs at suicide and death, and is pleased whenever people are sad or angry at her.  She currently beat the shit out of my character and she\u2019s laughing and mocking the fact that my character was in pain and ANGRY with her.\n\nNot to mention whenever the characters call her out on her bullshit, she IMMEDIATELY turns the argument back on them instead of accepting that she\u2019s a hypocritical cunt. \n\nShe just PISSES me off and every time she taunts how bad ass she is and how clever she is I just want to punch her out. She\u2019s such an infuriating character. And every time I come to type in this group, I feel my heart rate go up, my anger increase, my stress go up.\n\nI can\u2019t stand her. But the person roleplaying her is literally chill. And I don\u2019t want to be that immature asshole who just tells her to change her character to suit me. If she made the character that way, she made them that way.\n\nHow can I separate my personal feelings from the roleplay? I don\u2019t want to be entitled or cuntish towards my partners, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard to write with them because of that one \u201cso badass\u201d character.",

            "selftext": "So, this is more so a vent ( and advice wanted ) to relieve myself of these awful feelings I have, but first let me explain a bit of the situation.\n\nMy friend noticed I was having a hard time with roleplaying and offered to roleplay with me. We have known each other for 2 years now, have roleplayed in the past, and I consider her one of my great friends. She is very patient and kind, and doesn't spam me with, \"are you gonna respond?\" every ten minutes. She's a great person! \n\nRecently, she found a new roleplay partner. I have had the pleasure of meeting them and they seem like such a sweet person. At first, I was happy for my friend, but then as our roleplay started to die out, I realized something wasn't quite right. \n\nFrom what I remember, she asked me if I was still interested in the roleplay after I had been busy due to work. I told her I would, and I wrote her a response as soon as I could. Practically a month flew by, and she didn't respond. In fact, her messages to me, just general chit chat, stopped. I was a bit concerned and worried, because she was always active on a Discord server she made and recently, I have been seeing her slip into voice calls with the roleplay partner she made. \n\nOne night, I ended up joining them -- along with another friend of ours. We were just goofing off on call, but then, she brought up her new roleplay with her partner. The thing is -- she told me she had a really bad writers block and hadn't been roleplaying, but when she was telling us about the roleplay, I realized that it was a fairly new one. How? Well, she talks to me often about the roleplays she does with her new partner and this one was a brand new one I had never heard before.\n\nWhat was peculiar, however, was the fact that her roleplay partner snapped at her to not talk about it. It rubbed me the wrong way, it made me feel like they didn't want me hearing about it. I could just be paranoid, but the constant feeling of being ignored really has brought me down. I truly feel like she dislikes our roleplay, the one she offered to do, and likes her roleplay partner more than me, because she hardly messages me. She'll come back after a week, apologizing that she was busy or having a bad day, but the thing is -- I LITERALLY see her online, in the server ( calling or texting ), and nothing is wrong with her. \n\nI could be wrong! She could be having a horrible day, and would rather speak to someone that's not me. I get that, but this whole thing makes my head and heart ache. I love her so much, guys. She means a lot to me and I don't want this to continue. If you were in my situation, what would you say to her? I'm planning on talking to her tomorrow about all of this. Anyway, thanks so much for reading, and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking for advice on how to roleplay with another person and not be too overbearing with my own thoughts and plotting and how to accept their preferences. I think I am looking for perspective and methodology going forward.\n\nWhen I am about to start a roleplay, I have the habit of over-doing everything. I am very detailed and readily decisive, to the point I have been said to steamroll my partner's wants. That leads to them cutting off contact with me. When I am confronted with this, I no longer know a way forward and I become extremely uncomfortable proceeding writing with that person. It feels like they didn't like or want what I presented to them. In some cases, that is very true and they say it.\n\nI know roleplay is a joint, team activity and I have t o incorporate what the other person wants, but I don't know how to move through the sick feeling inside that arises from what I perceive as rejection. Because of this fault in my thinking, finding a consistent partner has been difficult and I just find myself obsessing on how wrong my thinking and feelings were with those who left me or I left them, and the rare few who sit in my contacts but we don't speak because I don't know what to say to them. \n\nI do have a few learning disabilities that greatly delay my thinking, my communication, and how fast I can construct a post that my partner would like, and it saps a great deal of my energy when I have to focus all the more intensely to avoid sowing seeds of discord or when I have to rewire, rethink and sometimes dispose of something I spent quite a long time on. Even this here post, at this mark, has taken a little more than an hour and a half to write up and check for bad grammar or punctuation. This frustrating conundrum is also something I don't frequently, if ever, bring up with my partners because I know it is my problem and I appreciate what patience and understanding is already given to me just by their being there and tolerating either an extremely delayed reply or sacrificed quality for speed. I don't want to come across as needy or greedy or entitled and I don't want a friend to bear the burden of pity or sympathy, so I in turn become unresponsive. This lack of communication results in lost connections. I guess I am looking for a different schemata for when these pathologies show up.\n\nWriting with another person is something I really enjoy and don't want to give up on. I like being able to write what my partner likes and I like being friendly with them when we are not writing in the story, but I don't know how to get past what feels like a massive and indestructible wall when so much as the smallest creative prospect is chipped or compromised away. Everything isn't supposed to be perfect, and this I know, so I guess I wonder how others accept the imperfections and sacrifices. For me, I have an awful habit of silence and eventual self-resentment at my own inaction that becomes extremely implosive and makes me want, more than before, to get as far away from my roleplaying partner as possible and leave it on one such note. Never come back. But the pattern keeps repeating, losing partner after partner, never knowing how to cope with differences and accept the rejections as they are due to a very widespread internal discomfort. \n\nThank you for reading and for any answers given.",

            "selftext": "I had to get a reddit just to share this story with everyone. I hope that maybe you wont make the same mistakes i did and wont have to deal with a extreme decline in mental health as well as almost losing the one outlet that helps you cope but brings you happiness as well. Please note im not a professional psychologist my diagnosis of whatever these three have is based on research not an actual professional training and our three toxic a--holes names are fake to protect their identities as much as i want to warn people to stay away with a ten foot pole im being the bigger person. Alright lets being shall we? Just a warning there are slight mentions of triggering topics involving abuse though i will try my best to not be too graphic.\n\nOur story begins last year on an adult rp site which im pretty sure everyone is familiar with. To protect their privacy ill say it ends in \"T\" Both my characters ive worked on for eight years in fact their profiles are still up pretty much my children if you will. Adonis was a cut above most of the other rpers on there he was well written and didnt ask for ERPs that for some would signal \"Hey potential FBI attention required\" Anyway, we played for many months which naturally out of RP started leading to a friendship. I found that we had a lot in common looking back i realized he built the perfect identity for himself. Our characters had an intense romantic relationship together sadly leading to perminant deletion (he ghosted them too) later on i found out he was manipulation other site users into thinking he was a transgender even sending NSFW materials \"himself\" another user even told me he ghosted them. I knew nothing of these behaviors of course Things got serious so when he asked me out i decided to give him a chance why not? Worst mistake i ever ever made. Adonis was almost the perfect romantic partner from day one that white knight we all dream about, showering me with affection even understanding i had severe trust/safety issues resulting from bad experiences years prior. He seemed willing to take things super slowly until well he started getting more pushy. I didn't see them for what they were RED FLAGS. Lets just do a quick highlight reel:\n\n\\-Wanted me to constantly talk to him, take selfies, even change my relationship status on fb. Wanted to do things constantly (Walks etc)\n\n\\-Joked using racial slurs with a friend \n\nwhich i refused to do.\n\n\\-Used his Race and Supposed mental illness as an excuse for bad behaviors. Acted triggered about things. \n\n\\-Convinced me into inappropriate actions when i didnt feel \n\ncomfortable with it (Leading to body image issues and severe depression)\n\n\\-Didnt enjoy the videos i choose to stream \n\nbut his were really immature.\n\n\\-Convinced me a close friend of twenty years should be  cut out of my life after i had fights with said friend who felt something  was \"off\" about him.\n\n* Used gaslighting being a nice guy to justify actions (Im just worried about you i love you...just trust me on this\u2026)\n* Lies a lot especially playing the victim of past crazy \"exs\"\n* Very dangerously manipulative he could get the devil to sell his soul to him \n\n\\-Acted really possessive about other male characters rping with me later on he even tried ruining others stories for the same reason. \n\n\\-Acted really possisive about other male characters rping with me later on he even tried ruining others stories for the same reason. racters rping with me later on he even tried ruining others stories for the same reason. \n\n\\-Conned me into helping lie or manipulate other rpers expecting me to lie about his involvement\n\n\\-uses your secrets and confessions against you.\n\nAround my birthday he texted me saying \"Im sorry to tell you this but my close friend just died.\" Of course i felt terrible that his friend died so i gave him space. Funny how two days later Adonis has a new relationship with Spudnik and blocked me. That is super disgusting to make up a tragic event so you can end a 2 month relationship even worse being i didnt do what he wanted every time he asked. None of these things i did anything about mind you throughout our OOC relationship i was super supportive even making an effort to share his interests actually  i think the main reason he did all this other than Psychopathy could be he actually believed so much in our romance rp he lost touch with reality. Ive been personally slandered by his new partner called things such as \"Playing a victim\" etc. \n\nNaturally, i turned to rp as a way to cope with being emotionally abused plus exploited which is where we meet toxic dipsh-t number two: Raiden. This player i had a long term rp with on site without issue. Raiden was like a mentor to me he gave me a chance when other rpers didnt me being relatively new. His group felt like family full of good times heck he even warned a few of us about some users violating site rules. He seemed to have an extremely unlucky aura that attracted trouble including someone that had a severe issue understanding certain things related to ERP So naturally when he started explaining what was going on i believed him. Eventually he got banned from the site yet again i believed it was unfair since on site theres a huge mods can be bribed easily issue plus we all believe friends over strangers naturally. We moved to Discord a server he created, things seemed fine until well his inner tyrant came out. Raiden likes lying A LOT just like Adonis did when really you can tell they are more than those small white lies we all tell every once in awhile. We are talking things like \"Im in a biker gang\" \"I lived in japan\" spinning colorful adventurous tales about things that never happened.\n\nOne particular incident he completely humilated me by faking he could speak japanese fluently while i was just learning the actual language. Raiden is a god modder his characters are all copy n pasted overpowered \"OCs\" from DC, Marvel etc i recently learn he stole mine and another rpers actual created characters go figure. His characters were way overpowered for example they were all immortal then trained as Deadshots proteges i mean some even stole from Fallout, Terminator really anything youd consider trendy. Also R was a completely Gary Stu creator with an EdgeLord problem. When we would rp as a group he always had control im sure you see where this is going nothing could defeat him yet totally okay if everyone else suffered horribly even being kidnapped by enemy npcs. Nobody was allowed any positive input at all he did not communicate when issues arose choosing bitching complaining to other members betraying their trust to stir up drama which ruined friendships between players. You had no support either, we were all supposed to give him worship especially when he felt bad yet you need support nope.  Sounds like Narcissism huh? He had favorites who would get all the attention while other characters in relationships with his got ignored belittled. He even neglected telling one about literal cheating on her leading to further distrust plus feelings being hurt. I think Raidens biggest sin was his inherit sadism to a point he did extremely violent non NSFW actions towards two characters including mine. We are talking really sick things i will not be mentioning. Sylvia ended up leaving because she was literally trapped as a writer. I feel so ashamed i couldnt help her he made himself the victim saying nasty stuff about her when really he actually severely abused/upset her. He hurt my characters feelings by not saying his was in a long term relationship with another player. Heres how he justified that: he created another character specifically for mine! Wanted his all his cake despite me saying i didnt want this consolation prize. Please note he ignored mine for years until Sylvia another rper stopped being his \"ideal\" partner then bam! Im supposed to be happy no complaints at all. Raiden is god all ye mortals bow down to his holiness *sarcastic snort*\n\nRaiden used guilt tripping when i clearly told him i didnt want a certain character to play with his as well as started getting creepy ass obsessed with my assassin character. You also must join voice calls,streams,when he wants it. He started naming his sims after my characters just like he had with Sylvias setting off a huge red flag aka past trauma after clearly being told not to. I reported a security incident to him on his server directed at him come to find out Adonis's new partner Spudnik was on the server! At which point things got ugly fast including cyber bullying. I really wish i hadnt said anything at all i suspect Adonis got wind of his new fling role playing romance rp with Raiden so he conned Spudnik who was a mod same as me into being let in (bypassing security measures) so he could start Adonis vs Raiden me being caught in the middle. Both are really just Sociopaths this year i finally cut ties with Raiden no words odviously he wouldnt listen. i couldnt take it anymore the abuse from those two plus their possibly willing croonie doing their dirty work against me. Another thing thats super upsetting is Raiden claimed he was active in certain communities which you can see was a huge theme majority of his rps along with crime. His behaviors towards his treatment of others in this lifestyle is actually things considered wrong even highly dangerous by the community which people new to it may be unaware of RP or not. He really tried pushing me into letting him be my mentor in this lifestyle outside rp of course i said no. \n\nAll of this has taken a severe toll on my mental health almost causing me to never write again. I was getting physically ill from all of this im still struggling to heal from their abuses and exploitation of me. My trust, previously before had been shoddy at best  shattered is completely gone. Sometimes i get triggered by certain things so bad i have severe panic attacks. Please please speak up about abuse in RP and OOC. Dont let anyone victimize you or your characters. Please set boundaries and cut out toxicity if you see red flags dont ignore them. I dont understand what RP does to certain already unstable people that makes them into further monsters who dont care what victims or pawns they destroy. Rp is a fantasy supposed to be fun relaxing not a psychological life lesson on basic human rights and decency. Its about expressing yourself in various ways not using it as an excuse to hurt others or further stigmatize those already facing targetting. Whether or not he stole my character she is still mine i refuse to let him ruin her. I still play her. It feels good to speak out against not only Extremely Toxic RP Abusers but also abusers in general after years of keeping silent. Remember dear reader you are valid you have worth. Your characters are they deserve respect just like people.",

I made a post on a then online-only roleplay server (it has since shifted to Discord only I believe). \n\nAfter sifting through quite a few applicants, I found one that I quite enjoyed. She was very professional (as professional as one can be regarding roleplays), she was full of ideas and was actively contributing to developing the RP further. \n\nSo after all the details had been settled on, it got down to starting the RP. Now, due to our schedules and timezones, we'd settled on our average posts being two to five paragraphs long (and with our intros being about a page) and that we would post during each other's off-time. In that, while I was asleep, she'd work on her post and vice versa. It gave each of us plenty of time to work on each other's posts and there was a verbal agreement that there would be no expectations from either of us for daily posts, given that I work in health care and that she had a government job. \n\nShe agreed to start the RP and I told her I'd give her four days or so to work one up, since intros usually take \\*\\*me\\*\\* a bit of time to get started. \n\nTwo days later, I get: \n\n\\*I fall asleep alone\\*\n\nHuh....strange, but alright. I figured, perhaps she'd accidentally hit \"send\" and was typing up the rest as a gigantic addendum. \n\nA week later though, I didn't get anything and I reached out, asking her if she'd managed to get an intro posted or if life had gotten in the way. \n\n\"I posted though. Like a week ago.\"\n\n\"I didn't get anything from you.\"\n\n\"No I could swear I sent it! Just a sec, I'll forward it to you again\" \\*proceeds to forward the same one line intro to me\\* \"Did you get it?\"\n\n\"Yeah...I thought we'd agreed on a page? I'm fine with a couple paragraphs too, but I definitely need more than a line.\"\n\nShe. Goes. OFF. I mean the level of rage she had at being expected to write out even a few paragraphs was insane. She voice called me on Discord and went off. How dare I suggest she put in minimal effort, who am I to tell her that her writing is subpar, who am I to set the standards of writing, her intro was meant to be open-ended anyway to allow for interpretation, why should she be doing all the work for me in setting up the background, the timeline, the era, etc etc. \n\nAt this point, I just found it so incredibly ridiculous that I had to make up an excuse to mute myself, but accidentally hit the button twice, thereby unmuting myself and allowing her to hear by gut-busting laughter at the sheer stupidity of what was going on. \n\nIt is safe to say that I am now blocked. :'D",

            "selftext": "Hey..so I just had an.....interesting encounter with an Rper and maybe I overreacted to the way they rped?\nSo some context, they messaged me regarding an ad I posted a bit ago and I responded saying I would rp with them. They had a very long and detailed message and I read it. It was slightly intimidating but I decided to go for it. I read through some of the plots they had (mostly horror which was a bonus) one was \"native american\". It was about the infamous W creature. I told him I liked that one as I am Indigenous (native). They had seemed decent up until this point so I was sort of (but not really, if that makes sense) surprised when they told me that \"native americans weren't important to the plot.\" It was basically all about our two characters being the creatures. That concerned me a little but I gave them the benefit of the doubt as some people don't know that things like that can be taken as disrespectful, what with some thing of our culture already being taken without us being represented. So I said \"Well I figured as much, I just thought it was kinda cool since I've not really seen anyone interested in our stories and things. Also I'm not in any way trying to be disrespectful when I say this but for future reference, you might want to include (even if it is just a tiny bit) the culture of the myth/story or whatever else it is that you're using as telling stories. People (especially people from my culture, I know from experience) will get upset and see it as disrespectful. I'm not saying you're trying to be and I understand why you're doing it, it's just that it's very easy to see it as disrespectful even when you're not trying to be. Anyways, now that that's done with, my top three would have to be A quiet little town, Slaughterhouse and St John's Hostel.\" And they said \"I'm honestly gonna pass on you as a partner over that. My post was pretty detailed and even explained what the whole thing was based on, not to mention offered multiple timelines.\nI hope you find what you're looking for, and have a fantastic evening!\" I'll include screenshots of the description of the plot in my second post. I immediately wanted to cry and maybe I'm just sensitive. They were 21 and I am 17, so I thought they'd understand what I was saying. I didn't mean to sound bad when I said what I did. I just wanted to warn them about how the things they did could be perceived.",

            "selftext": "Once upon a time, I went searching for an RP partner.(Earlier this week) and I liked their prompts. I messaged them, it seemed all gravy until we actually got to messages. They began by hitting on my constantly, not even in a cute way, or anything, but straight to it and I found myself really uncomfortable with that.  I tried not to say anything to mean, or even shoo him away, but I just ignored it and pretended he did not say anything at all.  Eventually, he said that he was just putting on an act.  I forgave it, hoping he would be himself.\n\nNo.\n\nWe finally got to talking about RP, but he always took things I said out of context, kept joking when there was no time to joke because I was getting frustrated with his shitty personality.  I tried to speak to him over VC in hopes he would not act up on voice, but he does and it's combined with him nitpicking at me, asking me too many questions, making me uncomfortable, taking everything I said out of context, being antagonistic, telling me to say things because he gets a \"power trip\" over it. \n\nInstead of just weakening to it, I put my foot down and said I had enough of his shitty behavior and if he could not get it together I would remove him and we would not roleplay.   I went to bed, ignored him and gave him the night to think about it.  When I woke up, he no longer acted like a shit head for the first time in a week, I was like: finally, he's being normal.\n\nHe said he wanted to VC, but ditched me out and then asked me for my post after I told him I would(and I did).  I told him I needed to go to bed, so we could vc if he wanted.  Yet, he started his bs again: antagonistic, annoying, frustrating, nitpicking, insulting, pushy, asking me to say/do things for his power trip.  I had enough and I said: Stop messing with me, now.\n\nI decided enough was enough, I put up with his bs for a week only to be frustrated and how useless it all was.   He said he was carrying the convo, which he could have been, but I was not interested in his quips because he's shown to take my words out of context and run them into the ground.  He kept saying I know nothing about him and I don't ask, but I don't ask because I am uncomfortable around him in the situation he has made for himself.\n\nSo, he started to insult me personally which actually hurt my feelings when I tried to be kind and told him: Hey, our personalities just don't mix.  I'm sorry, but I did enjoy trying to plot with you, I just don't think we are going to work out.  I'm sure other people, like you said, find you very charming but I don't get along with you and I hope you understand.   \n\nHe called me all these names, tried to gaslight me a little.  So, I told him something to get him to back off of me, which is true: I'm an abuse victim and he needs to stop.  Instead, he continued to insult me and said it was \"exposure therapy\" to be this mean to me.  I blocked him on reddit and removed him from discord, even though he kept trying to readd me. \n\nA part of me thinks he is a narcissist, he claimed to like power, liked to be aggressive and like to have a power trip. He showed no empathy for upsetting me or hurting my feelings, no matter how many times I said it, but when I did tell him that his voice reminded me of someone who was asleep and I felt uncomfortable -- he acted way more upset and said I belittled him, and I apologized.  He called me retarded, autistic, a child, etc.  I don't know who could rp with this guy, but I hope everyone can avoid him.",

            "selftext": "Let me preface this with the fact that I like to write evil characters. I have no problem including violence in a roleplay (though I draw the line at sexual violence and violence against children, plus I would never write an rp that is just gore because I need some story.)\n\nBut there is something I really can't stand. Many of my partners want to include a (often young, like, not a child but maybe 18) character of their own who is literally the purest cinnamon role who ever lived on this earth. That in itself is not a problem. The problem is when they basically expect my characters to torture this character, who never wronged mine and who will do nothing to oppose the main character, just to see them suffer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, a story which is basically 'your evil demon lord tortures this character who will always react in the same way by crying, will never try to run or think of rebellion, is literally to nice to think negatively about the person who causes their suffering and oh, there is not a reason for your character to torture them except that your character is evil to begin with' is not a very rewarding storyline for me to write. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reactions are always the same (crying, begging, never anger or even thoughts like 'this person is an asshole') but they still want every scene like this to be written in detail. Even if it adds nothing to the plot, because there is no reason or only a very flimsy one why my character should do this. Or punishments for stuff that wasn't the fault of their character to begin with and where punishments make zero sense (I am not saying that every punishment an evil character does to someone else has to make sense, but my characters are not crazy sadists, there should be at least a logical reason why they think that it will help them with whatever goal they are trying to accomplish).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n After the first scene like this, nothing new happens. Their character does not change in any way, you can also not suggest that the character will be freed by someone, and so on. So they expect you to write what is basically the same scene over and over again. That is no fun for me, in fact, it makes me feel bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother problem is people who want their character to be bullied. Which again, would be no problem for me. But if you chat ooc with them, you realise that they themselves suffered from bullying, and are now trying to re-live that experience. Often, they also want to change to happen in the story, and EVERY new character (the person at the counter of McDonalds, the primary school teacher they meet on a train, some random dude on a playground) should just insult and bully them for no reason at all. Even if you write a nice scene, they will add something like 'when she was watching the circus show, suddenly a man entered the circus tent and started beating her' (this is really a scene that happened to me once in a roleplay, and my characters, who were friends with hers, were not allowed to help her, because she already finished the scene without me lol).\n\nIf stuff like that is your coping mechanism (or even your kink, I don't care), please keep in mind what is realistic. And don't try to force your partner to basically insult your character again and again, while talking with them ooc about the bullying you experienced when you were younger. It feels like I am helping you selfharm. It just makes me feel bad. Especially if you use this experience to guilt me into writing more abuse scenes, and if I express that something is not very realistic answer with 'well nobody was nice to me, so it is actually realistic' every goddamn time.",

            "selftext": "My observation and peeve is coming from a forum experience because that\u2019s my area. This may be a specific experience...\n\nI guess everyone knows those RPers. Their style is an excessive overuse of thesaurus wank. They\u2019ve trawled all the synonyms and chosen the most elaborate words regardless if they flow or not. Sometimes, their writing staggers around the edge of something legible. A semblance of style that\u2019s not puked up verbs strewn down the page like confetti. Then they use orbs or optics to describe eyes. Record scratch. Damn, it was going so well.\n\nThese writers receive praise from the community. Which is fine, to each their own.\n\nBut something I always see, and it saddens me, are those who lack a particular confidence in their writing ability. A reason I love to RP is to experience other writers' styles, which are unique to them. Time and time again, I will read someone's post and it\u2019s fine. They\u2019ve got their own style going, and then it changes. The purple prose monster posts, and suddenly this other RPer is trying to keep up with the adverb masturbation. They try to mirror it all, and whatever style they have is cut to pieces and all over the place.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just go for whack prose either. I\u2019ve seen writers use different tenses, and then their partner adopts that tense even though they weren\u2019t using it in their previous post.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is. Writers, please don\u2019t do this. Like I said, I come to this hobby to experience different styles of writing (and no, adverb spam is not a style. Sorry) I don\u2019t need you reflecting my writing, or any other members\u2019 writing. You do you, I\u2019m here for that.",
