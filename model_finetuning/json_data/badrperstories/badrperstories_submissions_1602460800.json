So I came up with the plot a while back; creatures are being plagued by a villain who is more like an Overseer, the all-seeing eye. I\u2019m still building on the villain\u2019s reasoning, but basically these innocent creatures (and even humans) are being turned into mindless attack drones. Their joints begin splitting, their skin hardens and cracks, their faces go from normal to monstrous. They\u2019re all trapped in a mountain, turning against one another as these unidentifiable monsters. The disease spreads and blah blah blah...\n\nI love horror, and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually planned out a roleplay. So I\u2019m having a lot of fun\u2014or, I WAS having fun at least.\n\nTo explain, my partner, Cheese, decides it would be fun to have all these pure creatures (meaning the remaining ones that haven\u2019t been infected) sing. \n\nSing. In the middle of a crisis.\n\nSure, each healthy character is in a safe place, all away from the disease for the time being. And yeah, I like singing. I can\u2019t sing well myself but that doesn\u2019t stop me from jamming out with a baritone voice alone.\n\nBut like- singing while the rest of the world is being transformed into murderers that have split faces and disconnecting joints? Not to mention the Overseer villain is just out there, still infecting people. And yet Cheese makes her OC and the minor characters all sing like it\u2019s some kind of high school choir concert. How about no??? I just think Cheese isn\u2019t taking this all too seriously and I think I might bring that up if these random, irrelevant events keep happening on her end. Cuz like- Cheese got a microphone out of nowhere, and then the concert began.\n\nRight now my OC is technically just standing back and watching, probably thinking \u201cwtf?\u201d just like I am. Responding to this sudden outburst of singing is gonna be tough for me but uhh, sure, I\u2019ll try.",

My issues are trauma and mood based that cause a severe impact on my life. Now I'm not the type to be all woe is me, I usually turn my pain into a joke and that's just how I do things. I ramble, go quiet when stressed, get pissy, honestly it's really hard to control and I always try to let my partners or groups understand that it isn't their fault if I get sensitive. \n\nOne of my biggest trauma triggers is lying, not gonna explain why, it just is. I recently was forced to part ways with a group because I was accused of lying. The worst part wasn't that people accused me of being a liar it was that I couldn't process that information, I had to comb my brain for any possible reasons on why they might be right for the next few days. I was witch hunted by people who didn't understand me. Am I a saint? Hell no. Do I just go out to hurt people? No. \n\nWriting is my whole world, it's the only thing I have that makes me feel sane. In fact, it's the only type of social interaction I have outside of my romantic partner and doctors. I'm a passive aggressive person that deals with a roller coaster of emotions everyday. Roleplaying is something that takes a lot of effort for me, talking to people is extremely hard on me even though I do my best to play it off. \n\nThis last drama event has really taken its toll. I can't bring myself to write much anymore, I can't world build, I cant even look through rp community posts. I'm being to wonder if roleplaying just isn't something a person like me should be involved in. I can't say or do anything without having some people believe I am being the worst human on the planet when all I am trying to do it figure out how to balance being everyone's friend without being a push over. \n\nAlso if the people involved in the event I spoke of figure out who I am, please just leave me alone. I don't want or need your comments on this, you have all said enough already. And if people read this post and the account gets deleted, then my paranoia about posting in any rp community was justified.",

I understand that it is not the best platform to find roleplaying partners, believe me I understand that, but unfortunately it was convenient (whenever the tags worked and your post actually showed up in them, but we'll get to that). I know it isn't the best. This is why I am leaving. \n\nThe Tumblr RPC is a complete joke. If people don't ghost you completely after a few messages via the DMs, they will ghost you after you waste days plotting things out and discussing characters with them and presenting your ideas. This nasty habit has honestly left me deflated and hesitant to plot shit with anybody, for all I know they're just stealing ideas and running off to do the plots we are discussing with their other buddies (I've seen posts on here that discuss how this has happened to them). It's the most disheartening feeling in the world to spend so much time forming a blueprint with someone, only to find that they just ghosted after you presented them with characters you want to play. I honestly think one person ghosted me just because they did not like the characters I brought to the table and/or their face claims. And if that's the case, I'd much rather be told verbatim than to be left in the dark as if I've done something wrong. It's just rude. And yes, I know that no one is entitled to anything on Tumblr let alone the internet, but it's just the principle of the thing. \n\nIt doesn't help that for some reason, my blog has been shadowbanned and none of the posts I make on my roleplay account are generating in any of the tags (no this account has never been banned, no I've never posted inappropriate content, it's literally just a roleplay account). This is more of a Tumblr issue than a roleplayer issue, but it further adds to the compiling list of reasons why it's the worst platform to find partners. Honestly steer clear of it. If something does manage to take off, people ghost after two days anyway. It's a joke.",

Please don't just ghost me. The amount of people lately who I even try to speak to OOC, just to say \"Hey, how are you?\" and they do not even reply. But something even more annoying/irritating lately is when I go to message a partner on Discord and the text turns red:  Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient.  \n\nReal mature... rant over",

See, the difference between this is, if it was a one-on-one session, and not a group effort with four people roleplaying, I'd be a bit more sympathetic.\n\n*If you are going to be busy, do* ***not hold up a group and enter a session! They've been posting one-lines this entire time. One line is not hard. One line takes forty seconds from me watching them roleplay. It's just INTRODUCTIONS, as well.*** \n\nMy hatred is immense. How is it really going to take *three days* to get past introductory points and *out of zone one* on a mission while the person who is holding us up is ONE LINING? \n\nAnd the excuse they used??? \"I'm in a different timezone. You know this!\" ...What? You never told me anything about your timezone. I don't even *know* you. You didn't bother to let us know you'd be gone, nor what you were struggling with at that point \\[and it turned out to be literally nothing but school, which is present for all of, at most, 7 hours a day\\]. I, at multiple points in time, have expressed the fact that if people are *not currently available for a mission, not to take it.* People in a mission should put aside a few select days for it or at least *try* to make time for it. \n\n*It frustrates me extremely that he wants to keep going despite not only not being available, but putting little to no effort into it.* \n\n[My world is pain.](https://preview.redd.it/tpas434a1ct51.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb347b60182bdd6f04e1bf060106c0249f2cdcc)\n\n[Ugh.](https://preview.redd.it/7inznzlu1ct51.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=260b839e4d60f7b424687a2593e1c316a41f9cb0)\n\nNow, it might sound like I'm being pushy but rules are rules. There are people who are *far more active* waiting for a DM and an active mission slot, people who deserve it just as much if not more. I gave this person an option to back out and let activity persist. I have a feeling they're going to go radio silent for three days again, only to show up and post *one line.* \n\nIt would be one thing if this person was willing to give up their slot to someone who was waiting and available. Group before the individual with bigger groups. Don't get into roleplays you can't keep up with, it's a standard rule of thumb. \n\n*Posting one line every* *day, or even every three days, is wildly inconsiderate. If you want to be doing something else,* ***do not hold up the people who could be doing more.*** *Wait until you're free.*",

            "selftext": "So this happened a couple of months back. This was with someone in real life. There is a massive story behind this person, but since this is roleplayer stories, I'll focus on the shitty roleplay!\n\nThis roleplay was basically one that we've been talking about in school for a while. They were new to roleplaying so I didn't expect anything perfect, they had some funny ideas and seemed like they were deep into the fandom I was in, so I didn't think much of it. \n\nI had set them up an account on a site(which they soon changed the password to as I found out they were harassing others. So I deleted the account after) and began the RP. \n\nWith roleplay, if it's with someone I know IRL I tend to throw all of the rules out of the window, but that was probably the first mistake I had made with this RP.\n\nSo It began, we started of with our OCs interacting and the plot was going okay. UNTIL, the characters began playing truth or dare.  The usual clique \"who do you have a crush on?\" questions were asked and \"kiss \\_\\_\\_\". We had already planned who the OCs had a crush on. \n\nOne character I was playing said they had a crush on someone else in the RP and not my friend, and so my friend made her character run off into the garden. Not once, not twice, not even three time, SEVEN TIMES. \n\nSo I was pissed, I confronted my friend about it as it was getting irritating and we weren't advancing with the plot. They told me to chill and calm down and they were only having a bit of fun. I argued back saying I didn't like it and we weren't getting anywhere. \n\nSo I ended the roleplay. \n\nNot even a couple of days later a friend on the site messages me saying this:\n\n\\-----\n\nPerson: \"Yo, OP, can we roleplay? I need to get away from a shitty rp right now and I was told by someone you were an okay roleplayer!\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah sure! I'm up for roleplay. I had a bad experience earlier today. By any chance was it (Friend IRL)?\"\n\nPerson:\"Ugh, yep, how did you know?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, I made their account so I looked at their roleplays. I know it's a breach of privacy but I needed to see who else  they have been harassing. The past few days they have been annoying people. What happened in your RP?\"\n\n\\---------------\n\nAnd so I asked my friend what happened. They said to me that my friend pulled the exact same stunt but made  their character commit suicide because they couldn't date someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike what? \n\nSorry if this story is bad eheh-",

            "selftext": "I prefer dogs over people.\n\nI prefer any animals over people, really.\n\nIt's almost depressing how people might interact with and upset each other. I'm surprised people can't wrap their heads around the extremely basic concept of respect.\n\n*\"does anyone actually bother with this system\"*\n\nYes, which is why nobody else has complained about it other than the sole person who was currently complaining- they didn't even say anything constructive, they immediately came in with this. \n\n*\"i get that S rank is supposed to be extremely hard to reach\"*\n\n*Yes. It is supposed to be.* The person proposed a system in which ''Screw the system, delete it all, increase strength solely based on admins' judgement.\" We're a server of 80. If we focus on doing that, and there's no structure whatsoever, it would destroy the autonomy that we worked hard to build. They immediately told me I wasn't even making a point and that everything I was saying was incorrect. \"Strawman, strawman, this is a strawman,\" they say when I point out just how inconclusive their points are to anything other than personal preference. It's not a political discussion, which makes that extremely annoying, it's the systems of a server meant to be used so that everyone can participate.\n\nI explained that the system in itself was autonomous, meant so that we didn't have to hold hands. We wanted an authentic experience that had direction, had the ability to give certain builds, and make people *think* about what they're doing and what they want to put their time into. We didn't *want* people to reach whatever they wanted whenever they wanted and make the system optional- we wanted authentic progression, something to slow the hands of time and give one space to think. \n\n*\"but when youre just making the method boring\"*\n\nHe claimed that he found solo RP boring, and then immediately followed it by saying that he couldn't think of a way to roleplay in a group for training. Not only is that incorrect, but the system also appears more daunting than it is. Not only can you train multiple stats at once, but you can also train with teammates. He instantly made it seem like it was *our problem* he wasn't creative enough to think of training that could happen with two people. Let me think of three different training sessions.\n\n*\\[ Rock-climbing together. Strength/Stamina/Endurance. Make it into a competition. \\]*\n\n*\\[ Study session with a few bits of slice of life mixed in, perhaps staying late into the night and talking about your lives together, your dreams, getting to know each other. \\]*\n\n*\\[ Playing an intense game of tag. Speed. Anything else you use. \\]*\n\nWe also mentioned five other situations he could have possibly been in. It's not *us* that make the system boring; it's the person who believes solo RP is the only way and has no imagination whatsoever. The session is controlled by the players in it. You can change the way you want to build and gain stats. And yet, he still persisted, claiming that he never said solo RP was the only way **\\[even though it was in the statements, he left that out while taking screenshots of me supposedly** ***implying*** **his intentions when I, in fact, directly quoted him--\\]** \n\n*\"why even bother\"*\n\nThing about a group roleplay- you *don't have to.* And yet, his entitlement flared up. He wanted to change the entire system just because he didn't like it. He treated his statements like they were absolute and unbeatable, and that he was the only one in the right. That he wasn't being a jerk, that he was offering valid criticism and that we hadn't made any good points. In the end, it resulted in a ban. I decided I wasn't willing to deal with someone who had Main Character Syndrome. \n\nI'm used to trolls, honestly. I upset a group of people that were deciding to be trolls. \\[sending edgy memes and the like, stuff that's more annoying than funny.\\] Memespam isn't funny. Jokespam isn't funny. A well-timed joke with some conversation in between instead of half-a-personality where the person only knows how to make edgy jokes is always fifteen times better. But this was a person who was a part of that group \\[I've blacklisted them from all of my servers because they often start drama and don't add anything useful to the roleplay group as a whole other than being entirely rude and disrespectful consistently.\\]\n\nI'm pretty tired of dealing with entitled people, hence why I banned them. It's been a struggle lately. A constant need for mediation. People who seem to want me to chase them. I've stopped chasing. I've stopped dealing with it. \n\nA) If someone wanted to be there, they would be there.\n\nB) Chase someone too much, give too much validation, and they might start using you like you're a machine for validation. \n\nC) Being nice to people like this is really... really... *really* hard. I don't like dealing with people who start things for the sake of it. I don't like drama. It stresses me out. I hope this is the last of it because in the end... *I'm not responsible for;*\n\n1. *The fact you're not creative.*\n2. *The fact you're offended.*\n3. *The fact you're not willing to put any effort whatsoever into something.*\n4. *The fact you can't control your own emotions/ego and create problems wherever you go.*\n\nI'm just sick of ego, tbh. It's the leading problem in everything. Pride is great in small amounts when you have an achievement you're proud of. Not so much when you won't listen to anyone but yourself.",

That\u2019s a problem for her and she gets all pissy and upset because of it. She thinks it\u2019s attention seeking behavior and gets mad at my character for wearing what he likes.

            "selftext": "Hey! OK so this happened to me a while ago now. Not on this app I won't say it but I just wanted to share my story.\n\nIt started late last year. It was her who originally put up the role and I replied to it. The role was simple nothing special. She was dating my friend when we started catching feelings in the role nothing special to it.\n\nI was relatively new to role-playing at the time, I wasn't the best, my replies were short with little detail and alot of grammar mistakes I was horrible. However this woman was amazing to me she helped me learn was patient it was great.\n\nEventually about 6 weeks into the role I was flying, we were both enjoying the role it was amazing and that's when we started talking out side of our characters. We started talking about her home country first, then more deeper things, our family out lives and out hopes and dreams. I opened up to her about things I'd never spoken to anyone about.\n\nEventually we started flirting, making plans to meet up, sending each other caring messages, love hearts at the end of each messages and so on. Eventually it came to a time where I fell for her. At first I was afraid, I had girlfriends before and so on but never had I fallen this hard for someone before.\n\nBut as this happened she had a 'family emergency'. Now to clear up when I say this I'm not doubting what she is saying, it was the start of covid everyone was worried and afraid about it so I understand, however this 'emergency' went on for months. Every now and again I'd send her a message checking up, telling her I was here for her and so on. It wasn't daily I wasn't spamming her it was maybe one or twice a week. That's when I found another post, she posted it looking for another partner. So when I asked her to talk I confessed my feelings to her. To which she responded that I was an 'idiot' for liking her. I respected her feelings, told her it's not what I wanted but I respected her decision and asked to be friends to which she said no.\n\nShe ended up deleting her account and a few weeks later made a new one. I found this out because I accidentally replied to one her of posts about a roleplay partner. When I realised it was her I told her who I was to which she asked for my forgiveness. Now bear in mind I had spent the last few weeks hurt, I had fallen hard and she knew this. She pretended she 'had feelings but was afraid to admit it' to me. To which I obviously was delighted to hear and forgave her immediately. Where she then 'had a family emergency' again and then ghosted me for good.\n\nIt took me forever to get over this. Even now when I see her posting it affects me. But what I'm trying to say is that be careful online. I was lucky, I had a very understanding friend who helped me through it all.\n.",

            "selftext": "Where to even start with this. I guess I'll slap a disclaimer that to begin, I have absolutely zero ill will towards the players themselves. They're all wonderful people, but not the best writers. \n\nI recently started a group roleplay based around a popular JRPG series that heavily involves character interaction and dynamics (it starts with a \"P\"). It's a completely original setting and scenario that I've put a good amount of work into making unique. I'm quite proud of it. I've been roleplaying for close to 15ish years, so I've been writing for a long time and like to think I've gotten pretty decent with it. I don't like to sound elitist or too \"prosey\", but I like to write with quality because it keeps my admittedly fickle interest going. I try and stick to around 2-3 paragraphs myself, so my standards aren't even that sky high. Anyways, when I started opening up the group to search out players, I knew I would have to relax my standards just a bit or else I was going to spend forever searching for \"ideal\" players. It was tough, but I'd consider it some growth on my part after turning my nose up at people in my earlier years.\n\nAnyways, I get some nice people all in and I even get some decent enough writing samples. We're all excited to start and things are going pretty well for the first week or so, really. It's quick paced, and while I would like for posts to have some more meat to them, it works alright for them and I'm definitely in the minority. I get to flex my own muscles through the expository stuff, y'know?  \n\n\nWell, we finally hit the first major plot point that I was super excited to get to, and even though I'm losing a bit of steam since it's my first real GM story, I'm enjoying it. However, in what was supposed to really be where things kick off, I realized something. These characters are so fucking...boring. Once I realized that, the short posts really transformed from something I could deal with to me shrugging. Even though it had only technically been about a week In-Character, I honestly couldn't tell you ANYTHING of note for about half of them. None of their personality quirks, dreams, etc. Hell they could have nothing but personality and it would still make them more compelling to read then what I've seen. Let me go over what I'm, dealing with real quick.  \n\n\n**1.** One pair of characters are friends outside the roleplay and one was invited after I accepted the other, I don't have any issues with that at all. I'm cool. One is a stereotypical really nerdy anime protag archetype who is supposedly bad with girls, the other is a popular fashion model with a lot of money.  \n\n\nAnd they started dating after two days.  \n\n\nNow, at the core I don't REALLY have a problem with this, especially because I've made characters with friends who we intended to end up together. It's cool, whatever. But there was almost no build up in this situation. No chemistry, nothing. Just, poof. Oh now we love each other.\n\n**2.** Several of the others I feel like I'm reading the same character played by half the group. They're all friendly, outgoing, wanna hang out all the time, etc. Once again not inherently an issue, but they don't stand out from each other at all and it makes scenes with them together painfully boring to read and set up.  \n\n\n**3.** This one pains me because I'm very good friends with the player and I know they can do much better, but this character is an awful case of Mary Sue/Self Insert. She's supposedly really rough around the edges, grew up with a lot of hardship on the streets and with family. Super punk rock outlook, been in tons of fights, etc. But she's super nice and friendly with everyone and tries to be friends with everyone. I'll say it again, not really a problem on its own, but when you write several paragraphs about how rough this character had it growing up, my first thought isn't that she's super trusting and trying to make friends with every person she meets. Sorry, I'm just not gonna buy that logically.  \n\n\nSo, since I realized that I really am not enjoying reading these characters, it has been incredibly demotivating. It's so hard for me to want to push them forwards towards their potential and an interesting story when I have to comb for anything remotely interesting about these characters. It could be me being a novice at running a story, and I'll absolutely accept if it is, but I know I'm not crazy. I mean when I show your character a wall of several disemboweled corpses and I get a single sentence of \"how they want to throw up\" from three different people, how am I really supposed to want to put in effort for this story? I hate to toot my own horn, but as a GM you're supposed to make your players shine, but I've done the opposite because I feel as if all of the story NPCs have multitudes more character and personality than any of my players purely because they have \\*none.\\*  \n\n\nI'm gonna stop here before I ramble too much. I just want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation as a GM?",

So with his mod powers he banned 3-4 people and i slammed his ass with a ban hammer. \n\nThird rp, he fucking obliterates anyone and everyone on the enemy team with 40 tons of TNT.\n\n4th rp he obliterates every planet and every person, then the cockhead whines about \u201cit can really happen so why am i being told I can\u2019t do it\u201d and then he has the nerve to say \u201crps don\u2019t have to be fun\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t fucking know anymore.",

            "selftext": "Hey! \n\nI've been doing roleplay for near enough 6 years now on a site that is known for stories, quizzes and roleplay. You know the site, then you know. So I've been doing roleplay enough to know what pisses roleplayers off and what doesn't; not to mention, I've also managed to be able to tell how well a roleplay will turn out just by how much is said and how much someone contributes. Most of the time I'm pretty much bang on, but other times, I'm wrong.\n\nSo what I need help with is some suggestions of how I can try and filter out the people who know how to RP well, from the ones who barely know anything.\n\nI apologise if I ramble on, I'm not good with asking for advice.\n\nSo you know those convos which end out like this?\n\n\\---\n\nPerson: Hi! Wanna RP?\n\nMe: Sure, what are you wanting to roleplay? \n\nPerson: (Fandom name which I RP)\n\nMe: Yeah sure, here are my rp rules and info you need to know\n\nPerson: k (or insert any other response which is short and dry)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\\---\n\nand usually these roleplays don't end out well. On my profile I always make it clear that I only roleplay descriptive and do not respond to those who seem uninterested. I may sound a bit harsh, but this has happened so much to the point I've began responding to roleplays less.\n\nOf course I've had my fair share of amazing roleplays (Which still go on now. They too have have their fair share of experiences) but I honestly don't know a good approach. \n\nHere are my roleplaying rules and information that's on my profile and is pretty damn obvious.\n\nFYI I am 17. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The beginning of my rules. It states that I no longer roleplay with young people as I've always had bad experiences with them. Not to also mention that I don't allow script or basic responses anymore.  I want to also mention that most of these rules are laid back depending on how the person acts towards me. ](https://preview.redd.it/j0v2xi25ews51.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d5a05e43be8517ad36d0e700a1d19260b565d8e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I believe the beginning of these are reasonable. I despise first person in roleplays unless it's with someone I know well.  ](https://preview.redd.it/6iexo76gews51.png?width=1658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e18b66742be4ee6d05a94a4e8420f76c89060eb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkkm2m2mews51.png?width=1661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=874d8d8f4dfa4a8f3defcb3ad5f4de1917ecf690\n\nNear the end of the rules I was a *little bit* angry with mentioning \"do not message me if you don't know what paragraphs are or if you have bad grammar and spelling.\" \n\nSo do you have any approaches you use to minimise bad roleplayers?\n\nFinally, I want to apologise if I sound nasty or come off as a bit unsure or rude, I don't really post on Reddit much. \n\nAnyway, have a lovely day :D",
