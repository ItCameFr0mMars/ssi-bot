            "selftext": "So about a month ago I delved deep into my discord server list and found my old abandoned mega rp server which hadn\u2019t been used in a very very long time (several years at this point) and for the sake of nostalgia, I went through and looked at my old rps. \n\nIt was like replaying a childhood video game as an adult and realizing innocence and excitement made it seem better than it was. There were five different versions of two rps, each one nearly the same but somehow worse than the last. It was very..... \u201cOwO\u201d which is terrifying enough without taking into consideration the contents of one rp in particular.\n\nThis rp was that one moldy apple that made an already unappealing bag look vile. This was a kawaii \u201c1930-40s german\u201d rp that was edgier than a hot topic in 2006. It was one of the few rps I wasn\u2019t in, thankfully, and I find it amazing that I didn\u2019t shut that one down. \n\nThe rest of the rps weren\u2019t all that interesting. My favorite subjects haven\u2019t changed since then but the quality has increased exponentially. Many of the responses in that server were one line or even one word responses. Mindless scenarios that have no goal or story whatsoever. \n\nIt\u2019s been a long span of years and a lot has happened, but the one thing that I can\u2019t forget is this: no matter how crappy those rps were and no matter how bad of a group those people were, I had more fun doing those rps than almost any other aside from maybe two or three recent ones",

            "selftext": "I have been out as a Trans Woman since March this year, with an Enby stint for the year before that. Roleplay was a big part of processing who I was since I was 13 years old,  I wasn't in an environment that I was able to experiment much, and the outlet to be someone is important. I have always been a little more involved in NSFW communities since I did most of my real creative writing by myself and it was just a way to think about and process myself sexually. I have been moving away from NSFW as an interest since I can do self-expression with my partner, and it just feels a lot more gratifying not having it be a fantasy anymore. It doesn't have to be.  But getting back into roleplay for fun again has been really rough since I have been trying to be open about who I am. Most Roleplay Communities are not set up to be trans-friendly, and I have experienced all sorts of reactions when trying to discuss with mods how to make communities healthier for trans folks.    \n\nThe way a lot of communities work is by searching for genre, skill level, gender pairing, as I am sure you all have noticed. The first two are pretty universally useful, it informs the experience you are going to have, but the gender search is an oddity. It seems on face value to really only be there for romance and general NSFW play but the gender you work alongside or play as seems tied to the fantasy of things. You just want people you are attracted there regardless if the focus of things is sexual or romantic. A lot of the time the trend can be how important it is to be playing another gender. Women and Men writing Gay or Lesbain relationships are super common. (Don't think it is great for people to romanticize being in a gay relationship of the opposite gender they are attracted to that isn't interested in them.) But the point in all of this is to say that gender labels are an important part of the RP experience like it or not, and being a trans person Male, Female, or Nonbinary presenting androgynous, often means you have no repression for who you are in a tag. This hurts a lot, and I have tried expressing why this is important to a couple of communities and been met mostly with silence or a lot of resistance. \n\nTrans People don't fit binary labels, and historically we have been forced to either fit so perfectly into the gender role we wish to transition to that we are the stereotypical embodiment of that gender or just give up on expressing who we are out of fear of harm. No trans person wants to remember being their dead gender or doesn't wish they were born into a body that expresses themselves. But identifying openly as trans is important for our future. If we stay silent and all keep trying to pass into the gender binary if you are lucky that doesn't help the vast majority of us get the rights and treatment we deserve. Our recognition as existing is important for people to confront. It lets younger trans people have more information and healthier support systems. As well as doing more to correct harmful behavior.  Things don't get better taking abuse and trying to keep our heads down. A lot of people do transphobic things just because there hasn't been anyone around to tell them it is bad. This is some very fast background for anyone not informed, there is a lot of historical context behind why refusing to give trans folks a voice is bad. The labels are power, it means that we are equal to people that are cisgender. Not being allowed to have the same treatment as someone else when it is a very basic thing is discrimination. If you are Cis Gender you don't have to think or worry about this type of representation, it is default for you; a simple tool. \n\nThis has been the worst experience I have had in trying to get people to engage with inclusive flairs. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/jb0ims/meet\\_automod\\_also\\_faq\\_how\\_do\\_we\\_use\\_the\\_flairs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/jb0ims/meet_automod_also_faq_how_do_we_use_the_flairs/) \n\nIt has taken me a while to get to this just because I have been processing it. I don't like doing specific call outs, but I think this needs to be shared more for what the specific experience as a trans person trying to get equal treatment is. It might seem silly, or not that big of a deal, but seeing who you are represented in a space you like to use for relaxation and comfort is very important. I was a Mod for that husk of a Sub r/Roleplaykik  I joined the team hoping to fix up the space that I grew up using more or less after seeing it a dilapidated wasteland. I know what it is like to mod for a large RP sub so I know exactly how hard it is to make new flairs, not at all. I also know that lots of people don't use them correctly, or even follow simple basic rules.  I contacted the modding team polity several months before this explaining what the need was, and go an interesting sob story about life and a cis woman trying to explain to me that she knew what trans people needed and thought more than myself. Being left on read in a mod mail is one thing, the tone used and active ignorance of just not wanting to do something really because it is for a smaller minority is really gross. Not only this the post was edited after the discussion in the comments to fake apologize that they didn't want to bother with me and didn't even mention legitimate gender orientation. \n\n\"Whilst we're sorry if this upsets people, it would be a waste of time to add flairs like that (or flairs for Fu for futa or similar) when people will very rarely use them. Hence we stick to gender/GM.\"  \n\nFuta is a slang term for a fetish gender. It is not as directly abhorrent as a trans slur, but directly comparing what I was asking for, propper representation of my actual gender, to a porn term is really nasty. The words of one of the mods were \"You are free to be upset with us, call us bigoted, or lambaste us on another subreddit or platform.\" Upset doesn't quite describe the disrespect I feel, and using the term bigoted is far too genal. This group has been actively transphobic here.   \n\nSo I am bringing this up here on BRPS less to \"lambast\" them and more to spread awareness and ask for help from a community I have been spending more time in than actually roleplaying because of just how toxic it can be trying to say who I am. If you have the time maybe ask your local sub mods about how they are inclusive to trans people, and maybe offer the suggestion of expanding the flairs with a TM (transmale) TF (transfemale), and NB (nonbinary) option. This will help a lot of trans people have the tools that everyone else has to simply enjoy themselves writing, and passively help spread awareness of our existence. We are here and should be listened to.  Thank you to anyone that has read through all of this it genuinely means a lot.",

            "selftext": "You can probably guess where I'm going with this.\n\nSo, about a year or so ago, I joined a small Amino community for the show Fuller House (if you don't know, it's the spinoff of Full House, a popular show from the late 80s - mid 90s, both of which I'm a fan of), I posted an oc and after a while, someone messaged me and asked if I wanted to roleplay.\n\nI agreed. Here's where the title of this post comes into it. We chatted for a bit about how we like to rp and all that jazz - however, they didn't ask if I wanted to be my oc, or if there were specific characters I was happy to play. No, they said (this is as close as I can remember), \"I'll be my oc, can you be everyone else?\"\n\nAbsolutely not!\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, the main characters of Fuller House consists of:\nDJ\nStephanie\nKimmy\nJackson\nMax\nRamona\nTommy\nFernando\nSteve\nMatt\nLola\nJimmy\n\nSo, they basically wanted me to play all those characters, minus Tommy since he's a baby (but who knows, they might've expected me to play recurring characters from the show, too!), I don't think so. I stood my ground and told them that was not fair in the slightest, so they agreed to play some of the canon characters themselves. We only sent a few messages back and forth within the roleplay before the chat died down, which in all honesty I was glad about, that definitely wasn't someone I wanted to continue roleplaying with.\n\nThank you for reading! If you've had this happen to you, I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",

Whilst maintaining a character's idiosyncratic voice, I usually try and match and conform to my partners narrative style of writing. I study how they write and adapt to it. I have recently been told by one of my partners that it is a subtle form of copying instead of learning for myself my own voice, but it has always been how I approached Roleplaying but now I am worried they are right.  \n\n\nI have gotten comfortable and far with this partner and I would like to keep our bond, but I am also uncertain how to write outside of a mutual and consistent tonality. I can write my own way, how iwould write alone but then it feels like there are two entirely different stories being written and the discrepancy become percussive like vital instruments missing in a orchestra.  I actually thought my habit was a good one because my partner could read it with more ease in familiarity but I guess I was wrong.",

            "selftext": "There have been a few times when I've seen RPers start to mingle OOC \"politics\" with IC shenanigans or even visa versa. I'm sure most folks here have encountered it before. You and an RPer get into a tiff, and now, for no clear in-story reason, suddenly their character has an inexplicable vendetta against yours. Or, on the other side of the tracks, their character loses a battle to your character in some way, and suddenly there's this weird tension between you and the RPer now. It's annoying as heck and never fails to derail a good RP. \n\nIn the RP group that I was in, there were certain RPers who absolutely *prided* themselves in \"never mixing IC with OOC\" issues. Funny thing was... these same folks always seemed to be the very ones who would borderline on mixing IC with OOC issues the most often (hmm...). \n\nCase in point, in one particular scenario, one RPer (alias Jan) had her party girl character make friends with another RPer's (alias Marsha) character. They RP'd a few half dozen interactions before Jan's character invited Marsha's character on an outing to a club with her and her friends. So they RP a club scene, and at one point, Marsha's character makes a comment: \"Boy everyone's wearing so many bright colors and jumping around so much, you're like a bunch of exotic birds.\" Jan's character chuckles, laughs it off, and invites Marsha's character to keep dancing with her. \n\nFlash forward about a week or so later, and Jan's character starts acting cold to Marsha's character. Marsha's character is understandably confused, as this seems to come from nowhere, so she asks Jan's character what's up. What ensues is this exhaustively long argument in a series of back-and-forth posts between the two characters about the comment Marsha's character made about birds. Jan's character is apparently upset at having been mocked. Marsha's character argues back that she was not mocking her but was just making a comment based on a thought that struck her mind at the time. Jan's character insists that it was a snide comment made with the intent to ridicule her. Marsha's character keeps denying this. \n\nThen suddenly, Jan's character starts dropping *screenshots* of their club scene RP in her posts. *::Record scratch::* Hold up. Let's back up a bit here... \n\nIn an RP, when you describe your characters actions and quote their speech and dialogue in your writing, it is *narrative*... It's, in a sense, \"invisible\". When your character speaks out loud to another character, that is a thing that has happened in the physical plane between the two characters. When your character walks across the floor and trips halfway there, then there is no hardcopy record of that in game, because there can't be. The only way there could be any record of the character's actions or of anything they said *out loud* is if they had been filmed or recorded in some way. \n\nSo by all accounts, Jan's character should *not* have had any record of what Marsha's character had physically said out loud. There is no in-world explanation for what the screenshots were supposed to be or how they were supposed to be perceived by the other character in-game.    \n\nIt was around this point that the RP between the two characters started to get really awkward. Slowly it was dawning that Jan, the actual RPer, was the one mad about the comment and *not* her character... It was either that or Jan would have to admit that her character secretly films her friends at clubs all the time without their consent or knowledge... which is... kind of creepy.  \n\nEither way... You never mix IC with OOC stuff, huh? Sure Jan.",

            "selftext": "So, guessing the title grabbed your attention. Better buckle up for this ride. \nI roleplay often, as I don't have many friends and I don't leave the house very much. Now with quarantine, it's 3x as bad. I finally get a good roleplay partner, and he's wonderful. He loves all of my ideas, his ideas are great too, everything was just perfect as can be, a roleplay dream come true. But, as always, too perfect to be true. \n\nWe eventually hit an ERP scene, which I didn't mind. However, next morning, he says \"something was off\" and he doesn't feel like roleplaying anymore. We just end up talking as friends. \n\nSome time goes by and we're decent, good friends now. He says 'i love you' almost every day multiple times, and even cracks jokes about me dating him which I found odd. (I'm 18) Eventually we swap face reveals, no nudes or anything. He says I'm adorable and all kinds of things, and then, after a couple minutes of discussing each other, he says \"Oh, if you had daddy issues you'd be just perfect\" which I replied to with, \"uhh- why?\" Which he said he just \"likes them that way.\" I let it slide, which I probably shouldn't have. \n\nWe go at it, until we yet again hit another ERP scene, and just before we start, he has to go to sleep. Next morning, he tells me his girlfriend is jealous, and thinks \"she's just some other slut who wants to steal you from me\" and says he can't roleplay with me anymore. I found that to be some odd timing as they're relatively long distance, and when he woke up he texted me saying we'd continue after he got breakfast, and broke the news of the girlfriend as soon as he got back, which was roughly ten minutes. This upset me, as I finally got a rp partner back, and now all of a sudden his girlfriend doesn't want it to happen. \n\nWe argue a bit, he tells me the things she does which is OBVIOUS emotional and mental abuse. I call it out but he ignores. He then breaks to me that he's 30, and his girlfriend is only 18. Now, I'm not one to judge age gaps, so I just kind of let it slide, but her being so insecure became obvious when he said the ages. (Note, during this argument, he tried to 'lighten the mood' by saying something like \"if you'd just date me I could give you 100% of my attention instead of her\" which basically meant if I date him he'll do what I want and dump his girlfriend right there.)\n\nAfter a while, he eventually convinces her to let him rp with me, and we do it again. However, as soon as we get that roleplay going, we barely get out of them meeting each other before he brings up yet another excuse. He says he usually only gives 1 reply a week, but we had been doing back to back responses with every roleplay until now. I think back to the joke. I then realized, he's taking advantage of the fact that I'm a extremely lonely person, and takes my personal reason for roleplay(which I won't say here) and tries to manipulate it so he can get me to date him. Aka, \"if you don't date me I'll just give you some garbage rp rather than what we've been doing.\" During this argument, he made it pretty clear what his intentions were, and with everything he said he only proved me right. \n\nAnd, well, I'm not dating someone just for rp. It then dawns on me, he probably did something similar to his poor girlfriend. Her being so insecure, and dating a man almost twice her age like that? He probably took advantage of her own issues to get such a young girl on his arm, and I feel so sorry for her. All in all, I blocked him, called him out for the manipulation, and it's since been done with.\n\nTldr: old geezer tried to get me to date him for rp and thinks girls half his age with daddy issues are hot",

            "selftext": "Welcome to my first ranting post, this may get a lot controversial, but I really need to let some steam off after what I had the misfortune to read.\n\nBasically I happened to read a post on Reddit which title was \"*name of subreddit roleplay ad hub* is transphobic\". In the post the author explained that the mods of that particular subreddit were transphobic because they refused to meet the request of the author to add further tags that made it possible to express non binariety of roleplay ads and not just Male, Female or Anyone.\u00a0\n\nThe author posted the link of the subreddit and the conversation purposefully and specifically in order for trans people to choose whether to avoid it or not, clearly breaking the rules of anonimacy the subreddit they posted in has.\u00a0\nSince I was curious to know what was all about, I checked their conversation and read both parties' opinions.\u00a0\n\nThe mods said that there were already too many tags, and to not confuse furtherly their players they politely refused to add more of them and suggested to write any further specification in the title of the roleplay ads rather than asking for more tags which as many have objected, could cause much confusion in the search of a specific type of roleplay (also because it was not given an indication if the tags were referring to the player or the character the player wanted to use.\n\nAt this point I guess I could slightly visualize the issue the author presented, but the means they used were straightforward wrong as they were spreading lies about an honest roleplay ad board for a request that was declined and the author was given a solution in a civil way, which made the author unforgivable to my eyes.\n\nWhen confronted by other people this person avoided replying to the questions that were posed by other people and ultimately went like: \"If you do not agree with me you are transphobic\". I do not long to be political, yet I feel we already talked enough about equality of rights, and that surely doesn't mean \"if it is about a minority anything in its path must be steamrolled for the sake of the minority\". \nThis is not how equality works. Equality means everyone is equal, not that someone is more equal than others. Furtherly, transphobic doesn't mean oppose a transexual's idea, that means having a debate. It means dislike or having prejudices over a transexual for the person they are, which I think is bad at par with putting a minority on a pedestal.\n\nFurtherly, I read along the lines a concept I read already but never had the chance to express in a proper dialogue environment:\nBasically along everything else, the author stated a player couldn't roleplay a gay character of the opposite sex. I do not get this concept at all. I roleplay because I want to express something I am not in reality, such as a dragon, an elf, an android in a fantastic world\u2026\nWhy the same concept cannot be applied with gender or sexual identity? Who am I hurting by expressing myself?\u00a0\nThe people who play with me actually enjoy my characters and plan relationships with me, I do not get all this angst against someone playing something they aren't\u2026 Because that is the whole point of Roleplay to me.\u00a0\n\nUltimately the post was erased for being purposefully against the rules of the subreddit, but I thought of reposting something about it because I think there are issues we shouldn't overlook.\u00a0\n\nIn the end then the author denounced a so called bad roleplay, but ultimately, the author was the bad roleplayer afterall, at least to me.",

            "selftext": "Ok, so. First post, hello. (?)\n\nFor context, a friend of mine who I roleplayed romance 1x1 with told me about a group about a plot in a zombie apocalypse (or did I tell them? Anyway) and asked me if I wanted to join. I said yes, because I really like zombies and stuff. We agreed to make our characters friends and off we go. Everything was fine for like two days... until he appeared.\n\nMy friend's character (let's call him V) and mine were supposedly scavenging for food in a gas station when a  thief appeared. Nothing weird, right? The thing is... between the two of us, we have a small gun with two bullets, a kitchen knife, a beaten up almost out of gas car, three bottles of water and like two packs of crackers. This dude has A FULLY LOADED RIFLE, MOLOTOV COCKTAILS, KNOWS HOW TO THROW KNIVES AND IS BEEFY. We, on the other hand, are an accountant and an elementary school teacher with muscles that resemble Jeffrey Star's eyebrows. That's our guy. He threatened us and wouldn't let us go.\n\nLiterally.\n\nIf I said my character \"managed to run past him and exit the establishment\" he would say something like \"doesn't let him\" and SCREW IT THAT'S HIS LINE. It didn't matter what we said or did, he had a solution for it too. We shoot him in the leg? He dodged. Hit him in the head with a piece of wood? It doesn't hurt. Distract him? Doesn't work. There's a zombie on the door? He kills him with a punch without looking at it.\n\nV and I started getting frustrated because duh, and didn't want to make anything impossible but at that point we were done. We made him literally impossible for him to catch us and got to the car. That should've been it, right? Nope. Our characters are in the car, laughing nervously while thinking where to get gas from and the drill, until this biotch pulls out A MONSTER TRUCK out of nowhere and flips our car over, and then proceeds to run it over.\n\nWe escaped just because an admin told him to calm the heck down. Where do these people come from?\n\nTL;DR: We were kidnapped in a gas station by the love child of Rambo and Dr. Strange",

What I got was a text wall just skipping past the first area (reasonable considering it\u2019s very easy and you can literally run past without getting hit) but that wasn\u2019t my problem. My problem was he killed the boss battle at the end in the same message, there wasn\u2019t even two or three messages and he just killed the boss, sure in game it\u2019s a very easy boss but still, ya don\u2019t just one shot a boss like that.",
