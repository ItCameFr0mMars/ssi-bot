            "selftext": "So here's my first vent, grab a seat my darlings and offer me some advice on whether to stay or dip.\n\nRecently, I've been getting back into the rp life and thought it'd be fun to join a few discord servers. I found one I liked, good lore, friendly and chill people, somewhat active, and I went on to submit my OC. Afterwards, I advertise that I'm open for RP and Person A (for name sake) hits me up. We start rping, it was very thorough, fun, and paved way for more and Person A even complimented my writing style. I was a happy little clam knowing my OC was being well received and asked my partner what else they would like to do. The idea of shipping came up and we both agreed that we would eventually ship (both of us didn't want to just insta-ship as we preferred to have some sort of buildup beforehand. Makes it more natural and juicier to me).\n\nThey told me they needed a little break and wanted to get a few other rps out of the way before they continued and I said sure and went on to rp with others.\n\nBut then Person B submits their OC, a supposed, 'sexier'/'more erotic' OC and Person A immediately wants to RP and get a ship going with them using the character they agreed to ship with me. And for some reason I'm just...\n\nWha-\n\nI thought we were gonna ship so wtf? (Let me relay that I was very communicative and transparent, as I feel rp partners need to be on the same page. Because of this, we discussed multishipping, headcanons, etc beforehand and agreed that multishipping was a no for us and our characters.) So seeing this happen felt really...\n\nHurtful?\n\nEspecially when you immediately engage in an rp after telling me you wanted to 'take a break and finish up other rps.'\n\nPart of me wanted to confront them but part of me was like, 'Chill bruh, roleplay is just for fun and it really shouldn't matter. It doesn't stop you from shipping with others or enjoying other aspects of rp with them.' But, that just...made me feel like my OC wasn't good enough or something like that? It's so stupid but at the time that's how I felt? Guess it could be equated to also potentially feeling like an Option B if their rp didn't work out?\n\nWhich, funnily enough, their first attempt didn't, but that didn't stop them from publicly discussing in the server how eager they were to try again. (Person A wanting their character to be a 'slut' for Person B's OC)\n\nSo now I sitting wondering if I should even continue with Person A as they clearly just want the 'sexiest' character in the server to smut with which just feels shallow tbh. Not only that, they never really initiate conversations to get on the same page, and I dislike the delay of rping due to potentially being lied to, so what do you peeps think? Should I stick around or dip? \n\nAlso if I'm in the wrong, please correct me. I can only give my perspective and feelings, but ofc that doesn't mean I'm in the right at all. I'd appreciate that too.",

His character was always a god....always had a massive NPC army and Always had a Rival that was also played by him.    \n\n\nThen he got worse. Every time my groups of friend would make a character with an interesting Concept it would make a character a day later with VERY similar concept with only slight alterations. Friend made a pirate...he soon made a pirate to rival him. I made a mafai man he then also made a mafia man. Another friend made an alien who wanted to infect humans. He man a evil Docter who wanted to mutate human Ect ect. It became very annoying.",

            "selftext": "If you're someone who generally hates feminism - this **probably** isn't the post for you.   \n\n\nI'd read about this interesting thing, **I suppose**, on an ask-women subreddit, and it got me googling. After a lot of reading, I applied it to writing and roleplaying, and now I'm taking a **sort of** poll to see how it translates.  \n\n\n**Essentially**, it's that women or otherwise feminine-presenting humans tend to use qualifiers when speaking, writing, or **generally** communicating with others, regardless of the gender of the other party.   \n\n\nWhen we do this, we put ourselves in a subordinate position while giving the other party authority, whether we mean to or not.   \n\n\nThe most common qualifiers are \"just\" and \"sorry.\" By now, we've all heard the whole \"stop saying sorry so much\" thing, but we've **still largely** kept \"just\" in our frequent use.   \n\n\n**Now**, I grew up in a non-English-speaking culture. Where I lived, we did not have qualifiers like \"just\" or \"really\" or \"even\" or \"quite.\" You were a thing or you were not. When asked a question, you responded directly to it. Since moving to the States and writing with predominantly American roleplayers, **I've noticed that** I've been told SO MANY TIMES that I \"need\" to soften my speech.   \n\n\nI cannot count high enough to express how many times a male writer (it's never been a female writer) has told me to use emojis to show that I'm not angry, or to be less direct. It's to a point where I put my fellow roleplayers in one of two boxes.  \n You're either an absolute moron, in which case I'll put on my kid gloves and hold your hand to explain everything slowly and with very few syllables; or I think you're intelligent and someone I can respect, and then I'm very direct because I don't think you need all the flowery speech that qualifiers are, **to me**.   \n\n\n**Basically**, if I respect your intelligence, then I won't waste your time, and I won't use qualifiers. That's **just** how my brain works. Then there are times where I know what I'm saying is harder to swallow, then I'll soften with them. But this is all OOC.   \n\n\nI applied this information to my **actual** writing, then I polled my server and a hub server I'm affiliated with, and here's what I've gathered.  \n\n\n* This is **mostly** only a thing in English-speaking cultures.\n* Male or Male-presenting writers who come from non-English countries in Europe have been similarly conditioned to use qualifiers.\n* Female or Female-presenting writers across the board do feel like they need to use qualifiers OOC so they don't come across as bitchy or nagging.\n* Female or Female-presenting writers are often told they need to use emojis to show they aren't angry. \n* Male or Male-presenting writers who have been polled (**so far**) report that they have never been asked to soften their speech or use emojis to show they aren't angry.\n* Female or Female-presenting Mods have reported that they do feel the qualifiers are necessary to convey a less aggressive tone. \n* Male or Male-presenting Mods have reported they don't feel a need to adopt qualifiers because the other party's emotional response is not their responsibility.\n* Writers who play characters of a gender that is not their own have reported that they will or won't use qualifiers based on the character's gender, whether they realize it or not. \n* Writers polled **so far** also report that their male characters do not use qualifiers because they are meant to convey a tone of finality whereas female characters overall are written with softer views that can be swayed or changed.   \n\n\nNow I'm passing this on to this subreddit.   \nFor the ladies or lady-presenting peeps in here:\n\n\\- If you look through your recent posts, do you see yourself doing this? If so, how often?\n\n\\- In learning this, do you think you'll try to curb it or are you apathetic to it? \n\n\\- Where do you think you picked this up?\n\n\\- If you play male characters, do you change the way your character thinks or speaks, subconsciously or otherwise, to reflect a more \"masculine\" energy?   \n\n\nFor the dudes or dude-presenting homies in here: \n\n\\- Do you do this yourself? If so, how often?\n\n\\- Do you think you'll stop now, or does it not matter? \n\n\\- Where do you think you picked this up?\n\n\\- Do you notice other people doing this? \n\n\\- If you play female characters, do you change the way your character thinks or speaks, subconsciously or otherwise, to reflect a more \"feminine\" energy?  \n\n\nAs well as a challenge, for those interested in a bit of a social experiment. I want to challenge those who play female characters to not use qualifiers as much as they can for the next day or so to see how often that knee-jerk response is and where you think it's coming from. For those who play male characters, the opposite - use more qualifiers and see how it might change both how your character is conveyed as well as how it changes the way you communicate or are perceived by your fellow writers.   \n\n\nFor those of the trans or non-binary community, I'm especially interested in your thoughts about this.   \n\\- Do you use qualifiers?  \n\\- When you do, is it to convey something gender-specific?  \n\\- Do you think a \"softer voice\" implies gender?  \n\\- Do you think it's necessary to use them?   \n\\- Have you had experiences in RP where people have asked you to soften your speech patterns?   \n\n\nTo close this out, I **want to say that** I went into writing this intentionally keeping the qualifiers **I was inclined to write**, out. I know that this topic will be touchy. I've had experiences on this subreddit where male writers have told me that bringing up gender issues is generally unattractive (to which I gleefully respond: *eat 12 dicks, and choke on the 13th, kthxbye*). However, I know I **probably** have still ended up using qualifiers because I'm **still** approaching this knowing it's a subject that will annoy some people, and I've been living in a society for a decade now where I've been taught to walk on eggshells and be apologetic (which is what qualifiers **ultimately** convey). By the time you reach this blurb, you'll have noticed some words throughout this have been emboldened. Once I'm done writing, I'm going to go back through this to bold out my own qualifiers, even though I did try not to use them.",

That message included a warning that pretty much amounted to \"the character may seem overpowered and edgy but they're really not\".\n\nYou can understand my trepidation in clicking on the link. But I did no less, as this was the character they were hard-set on playing.\n\nHoo boy.\n\n\"Edgy\" and \"overpowered\" would be an understatement. The tl;dr of it was that the character was an alchemically enhanced assassin that had been trained by a secret society. He had then turned on said society and single-handedly killed them all. He wields unique weapons, has a suit of near-invulnerable armour, has numerous other enhancements and so on. He not only has continued to work as an assassin, but has a string of trophies from all the people he's killed. Oh, and due to alchemy stuff he looks like he's thirty when he's closer to sixty and will live for ages and stuff.\n\nThat was a solid 'yeah, no' from me.",

            "selftext": "I'm not sure if this counts since we technically never rped, but I was definitely considering it. A few weeks ago, I was starting to get into BSD (Bungou Stray Dogs, basically the jist is that characters are famous authors as teens &amp; adults with powers based off their books) and I was a little uncomfortable using ocs based off real people (authors), so I thought that maybe using authors who have since passed maybe a hundred years or so ago would be more palatable.\n\nI began looking for a partner on some sites and found someone's OC book (it was public, if that's something you need to know), they seemed friendly enough by their profile, but when I saw their characters, it overall left a bad taste in my mouth. They used authors such as Roald Dahl and Stephen King (Roald Dahl being an antisemitic, racist author who passed less than 50 years ago and Stephen King still alive. Notably in their Roald Dahl's history, they had him r/ped and in Daniel Brown's history (who is also still very much alive) had him ab/sed. I wasn't sure how to feel since I'm pretty new to the fandom, but I don't really feel that it's moral to do any of that to author's that either died recently or are still alive?\n\nI messaged them about it and said that it's probably not ethical to make ocs based off real people and had histories like *that*, out of respect for the real people and went to sleep. Next morning, they launched into a defence about how they were making them \"out of respect\", \"wasn't being disrespectful\", and how the authors were quite hidden away so the living relatives of them probably wouldn't find them (in my opinion, it sounds like they already knew what they were doing was distasteful???) and how they was going to make another oc of an author they liked that passed away less than 20 years ago because they loved them so much. \n\nAnd with that I lost my patience and told them that it's not being they were disrespectful, but what they were doing was disrespectful, if they knew the first thing about the authors they made ocs based off of. That if they even knew that Roald Dahl was antisemitic and racist or if Mary Shelley was a feminist before feminism (I wasn't too heated about this one, since she passed around 200 years ago already. But, it still was super in bad taste to make her \"afraid\" of men)\n\nThinking back, I probably should've been a lot more polite about it and that I had a fairly elitist attitude about it (I don't remember since I can no longer access the messages) and that I probably went off on a kid who didn't know anything about political correctness, so that was my bad. Though, I did say that it wasn't my place to say that what they were doing was wrong and that I was just giving my opinion. And then they blocked me, so I can't even access the messages anymore or see if they replied to me.\n\nSo, I don't think I'll ever try roleplay BSD, not that I ever started. My first experience in the fandom put me off. I've been trying to convince myself that it's just characters based off the author's books with the same name as the author, but it just feels like I'm disrespecting them since they're still based off real people, have the names of real people and so on.\n\nReal people fiction, more RPF on recent people, personally puts me off completely, especially if it's authors that I respect. It just doesn't feel right for me, especially with the ethical ambiguity of RPF in general. I find that RPF normalises the objectification of celebrities and public figures, objects to entertain ourselves with. BSD sort of puts a barrier between the real people and the characters, but I'm still uncomfortable even thinking about creating characters of real life breathing people or of the recently deceased.\n\nI don't know if this is completely normal within the BSD RPing fandom, so I don't even know if this is something I should be concerning myself with. Maybe I'm being too sensitive and not minding my own business, but yeah.. That was a sobering first experience of the BSD roleplay fandom.\n\nSome people might find rping BSD completely fine and have the view that it's really just based off the books and not the authors, and that's completely fine, live your life. Y'know, freedom- But, for me,.. *flies away*\n\nTDLR: I got blocked because I said \"maybe don't make an ocs based off people who are still alive/died recently and have them get r/ped in their history.\"",

            "selftext": "Let me regail you with a story from my past. one of the many stories that contributed to my eventual dislike of public RP's (and party my temp hiatus on normal RP)\n\nsome backstory before we go in\n\nthis was quite awhile ago so (sometime last year) and i was still fairly fresh faced for RP. it had always been an interest of mine but i hadn't really focused fully on it until that year (had been RPing on and off since about 2016. but started to focus on it late 2018/early 2019) and in that time i had joined a server with the promise of being able to focus on more mature/adult themes, but it turned out to just be a cesspit of ERP. we'll call this place the \"Adult\" writing server for anonyminity's sake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe \"Adult\" writing server was where i met some my best friends but also had some of my worst RP experiances. one of which is the tale i'm telling now. here's some tags for you to understand better\n\n**Me (me) MC (My character, Will be shortened to C at some points) L (Person) (D) (Person's character)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\non 1/9/2019 i had made a post seeking people for an rp that could tackle darker themes, not really NSFW or ERP. Just adult orientated themes. on 2/9 L had contacted me. it seemed pretty decent at first although i did seem a little offput by one of their mentions, since i had said it wouldn't be a sexual focused thing  \n(Initial messages)  \n\n\n&gt;L: Well hello there. I read your partner search in Dark, I think we have a lot of similarities as far as our requirements go. Something you didn't quite mention was if you preferred to play as a Domme or a sub, which wouldn't change my interest either way. Just something to clarify before I can offer a character as well.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me:  since lewd isn't the main focus i don't think that really matters. but i'm a switch \n\nthere's some small back and fourth and we eventually settle on a plot. an archer styled character (D) and i'd be playing a half-elf bard looking for her father (MC)\n\nafter i put all that out and all the story L gets back to me with an idea i quite like for a starting plot\n\n&gt;L: Looks fine to me, any idea of how you want to align these two character's goals? D is hounding for glory, C is looking for her dad. My assumption would be that C gets a lead about her father in a tavern, but in stereotypical fantasy fashion, she can't get told what that is until she's done a favor. Her not being all that combat oriented, she doesn't quite know how to approach dungeoneering. (Not calling her useless in those scenarios!) But D overhears and could ask C for a little compensation for assisting her. Insert conversation about what they can offer one another after they've solved this leg of their journey and bam, two person party. \n\ni agree and we set about getting a public channel ready. and then the RP begins, from here on out my character will be referred to as C for posts to make life a little easier. Details will also be a little shortened and abridged to make life easier for both me and you the reader. so i'm not copying entire lengths of text and you're not having to read a full RP\n\ni took the charge on the initial post. the guy who had the info was a sleezeball and had info on C's father and i made that pretty clear. i also made it pretty clear that he didn't really care for her, willing to send a young (by elf standards) bard into a kobold mine before giving up that information, D finally enters the scene with a brazen tone\n\n&gt; D: I chuckled at the pathetic display the man offered that elf. \"You're busy today, huh? Busy sitting around getting hammered to deal with your own damn problem? You're not busy, you're pathetic. A few monsters, yeah? What kind, what sorts of things can this pretty little elf be expected to go up against?\" \n\nshe went on to clear up that she didn't intend it towards C and continued to insult the barkeep\n\n&gt;C: she smirked a little and bowed her head a tiny bit \"well i'm glad you enjoyed the show\" she said with a smile before speaking again \"i don't mean to be rude but, who are you?\" she asked with a slightly confused tone, raising her hand a little to scratch the back of her neck and tuck some strands of hair behind her ear\n\nhere's where red flags start. the man that had offered the info to C wasn't showing any hostile intentions. Just being a piece of shit, this was D's response\n\n&gt;D: Within the span of his last sentence and the elf's acceptance, I pulled my bow from over my shoulder and nocked an arrow. The heavy draw was nothing in my experience hand and I aimed down the flighted shaft. Our eyes met and in that moment, the chatter of the tavern died away.\n\ni didn't say anything at the time but this set off a few red flags as i mentioned and i had to double take. things got a little worse\n\n&gt;D:  \"Who am I?\" I asked. \"My name won't matter if you don't watch your tone.\"  As quickly as I'd drawn my bow, I let the bowstring relax and put my arrow back in my quiver. The exquisitely crafted bow remained in my hand, \"She can't do the job, I could. A prick like you wouldn't have the kind of money I'm looking for, but you,\" I said as I turned to face the elf, \"from the size of that purse the barkeep gave you, you could probably hire my services.\" \n\nimagine if you will, you just ask someone for their name. but then they threaten the person trying to hire you and then blow you off/threaten you for asking their name, i assumed they misread something along the way, corrected them. and moved on witht he post. C asked again and finally got an answer\n\n&gt;D:  I turned on my heel and called out, \"\\[D\\], if you were that interested, elf. If you intend to see this through, I suggest picking your feet up and coming along. Otherwise, I'll just be wasting arrows without even getting paid.\" \n\nC introduces herself and they set off after a brief bit of thought insulting from D. my character asks a few questions about this strange woman and after a weird weapons check gets this response\n\n&gt;D:  \"Any more questions or would you mind leading on to the mines? I'd hate to have the sun set before finishing this.\" \n\nC (Who was born in the town) mentions that the mine is just outside of town and they'd easily be able to reach it before the sun went down. she even made mention that the sun would probably still be up by the time they finish, making note of how easy the job would be with the two of them\n\n&gt;D:  \"Great,\" I mumbled, \"The sun should be up by the time we finish? You really think it'd take all damn night to deal with a few pests?\"  She either overestimated how long it'd take me or she simply had no clue what she was talking about in the first place. With that being the case, I stepped ahead of her and walked towards the gate leading out of the east side of the village. On the way out, I waved to a guard, \"How do I get to the mines?\" \n\nthe guard and D have a bit of a back and fourth before being directed to the mines. this is when more red flags start to crop up, the bard i was playing was a bit of a romanticised hybrid of a minstrel and the typical DnD bard, constantly thinking up songs and using the songs to make magic (of which i mentioned it'd be based like a DnD bard) so MC brings out her lute and starts working on a little tune she had thought up\n\n&gt;D:  As pleasant as the music was, it still irked me to hear. Maybe she was used to the city, but we were heading into an area where creatures had taken over. Did she really think announcing our presence was such a good idea?  \"Who knows if we're just walking into an ambush, C? Put that lute up and have a weapon at the ready. First rule of not dying is to not be unprepared,\" I called out to her. Her life had probably been nothing but roses and sunshine if she didn't know basic rules of the road. \n\nC makes a mention that she's a bard, even with a lute up she isn't defenceless since she can weave spells with song. going a further note to make mention that adventuring groups hire her kind for a reason. in a complimentary way C idly says that D could probably handle anything that shows up any way and that she \"Probably wouldn't even need to dirty her knife\" ... ***D did not like that***\n\n&gt;D:  I was tempted to cut the strings on her irritating instrument. Even if the sounds were pleasant, it didn't sit well with me. Instead, I simply ignored her. She wasn't willing to listen to what I'd asked of her so I'd have to treat her just the way she was acting. As a liability.  She was nothing more than a source of income for me at this point. Whatever cock she sucked in the tavern to get a coin purse that big from the barkeep was between her and however many people were in that line. Spoiled little thing. \n\ni remember being quite heavily confused and also slightly annoyed by this since it was completely unwarrented given both IC and OOC information but i continued on against my better judgement\n\n&gt;D: In the distance, I could make out the sudden dip in elevation and called out quietly, \"Quarry up ahead. They should have guards at the door, they'll need to be taken care of quietly, otherwise we'll have to deal with a prepared nest of the little bastards.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;C: she continued to play away as they approached before speaking, getting low \"you're an archer, how far away is it?\" she asked with a raised brow \"the entrance i mean. if its within sixty feet then i can do my job\" she said merrily. she had stopped playing since they had gotten close to the mine, however it looked like she was ready to start playing it again \"i assume its within sixty feet if we're approaching the entrance of the mine\"\n\ni was given no descriptor of the mine. just that the mine was close and we had just reached it. i decided to ask IC to possibly get some better interactions since it'd been pretty dour... ***D also did not like this***\n\n&gt;D:  \"Are you daft? The quarry is down below the dip over there,\" I gestured towards the lip of the quarry, \"if we were within sixty feet, they would have already heard your damn music. Now keep your mouth shut and find a way to be useful that doesn't make noise.\"  The damn elf was as dense as they come! I carefully shuffled closer towards the steep slope leading down. Getting down on my stomach, I counted the four figures down below. Two were in the process of fighting over what looked to be a charred rat's corpse while the other two seemed to be engaged in conversation with each other while standing in front of the gates. Their crude weaponry wasn't exactly intimidating, but with four of the little bastards, my job was going to be a lot more difficult. \n\ni'm sure we've all seen the meme of the guy blinking in confusion. that was about how i felt. D/L also continued to confuse me\n\n&gt;D:  The two paths leading into the quarry would both leave me exposed, but the southern entrance would give me the best chance of killing the two guards with my bow before setting upon the two that were fighting over food. A part of me almost asked the brat what she could do to help, but with as useless as she'd been so far, I figured it would be best to take things into my own hands. \n\nD went on to do cool guy/girl \"I defeat the enemies with no issues and do it stylishly while i bloat my post with needly detail. like explaining how kneeing someone works\" this was when L approached me in DM's again (i cut quite a bit of info from here as it was mostly D/L acting while my character sat on the side. i felt like i was rightly annoyed and figured that'd show plainly on a bard with some ego)\n\n&gt;L:  I'm really not feeling any real input from you at this point. Like, the details you offered about what they're going to be doing has been super scarce and vague. I'm fine with doing a chunk of worldbuilding, but I'm just not feeling much effort. The character dynamics have been awful as well so far. I'm not going to ask you to change if you don't see the same issues, but if something doesn't give, I'm going to have to end this RP.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me:  it was supposed to be vague and scarce of info. the guy is obviously a dick and doesn't care if they survive or not seeing as he was willing to send a bard alone into an abandoned mine shaft. as your character said themselves, he could be sending them into something mundane and easy, or something hard and clearly not fit for a lone bard, like a necromancer lair. but i get that, i could have probably done something more in terms of him giving info but i thought it was clear that he was being vague on purpose  as for the character dynamic. your character has been brushing mine off quite often. and when she asked how far the mine was from their current location. and if it was within 60 feet, you completely brushed her off and then posted this  \\[Comment about how C was useless and D wasn't even going to ask if she could help\\]    \n&gt;  \n&gt;the dynamic problem is very much on your end \n\nby this point in RP i thought i'd finally start playing what D/L had been assuming my character was and i started making snarky remarks and sarcastic comments on the offhand. up until then i had been playing someone that was respectful but overconfident... ***guess who didn't like that***\n\n&gt;L:  Read the full post. In the distance, I could make out the sudden dip in elevation and called out quietly, \"Quarry up ahead. They should have guards at the door, they'll need to be taken care of quietly, otherwise we'll have to deal with a prepared nest of the little bastards.\" And your character ignoring the advice given to her gives Danica plenty reason to think she's being a brat. No matter the case. I've lost all interest, this RP isn't my cup of tea. Take it easy. \n\nas L sent that i was in the process of saying that i didn't want to continue. so i responded with a simple message\n\n&gt;Me:  lol w/e, i was about to cut it off anyway since you've been nothing but disrespectful for no reason   \n&gt;  \n&gt;L:  \\^\\^. Please do not message me further. \n\ni then made a sarcastic \"was way ahead of you\" comment and proceeded to block them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe funny part of this is something i only noticed recently. they ended up getting into an ERP right after and treated their partner with so much more respect and kindness. couldn't help but chuckle as i was strolling down memory lane\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfirst post here and hopefully i won't be a frequent poster haha. Look forward to reading some of the shit people deal with",

            "selftext": "I know the term \"mental load\" is used in subs dedicated to relationships and interpersonal dynamics but as I've gotten older, I realize it can apply to other areas in life. And right now I feel like I'm often the RPer (in one on one situations) who takes on the bulk of the mental load. \n\nLet me preface by saying, for 80% of the time, I don't mind steering the ship and making the first post and getting discussions rolling. But...but there is that other 20% where I feel burnt out but also like my partner doesn't even care. I can see that if one player posted a plot/prompt, it should be on them to take the lead and get their partner on the same page. I get that. But I also believe if you express interest in the idea (even if it's not your own), you should still be an active participant and bring ideas to the table. \n\nI've run into this problem a lot more often than usual, hence this post. Normally I'd shrug it off and enjoy the ride, even if it felt like I was the only real passenger and driver. But...I've been hunting for a certain celeb RP for about a month now and each time I get someone interested, it always falls on me to plan the plot and set the pace. Which again, I accept, it's my craving and I want to be on the same page with expectations and for my partner to also feel happy and included. I'm not a happy writer unless my partner is happy and this request is one I'm pretty flexible on.\n\nAnyway, I find someone and I give them an idea of how I could see events leading things to a longterm plot (example: our characters go on tour together, a reason for them to interact and collab on new music). This partner seems unsure or disinterested, not at all able to suggest another plot or path that keeps our two characters together/interacting. I explain that in the big picture, our characters are going to need a reason to hang out and befriend one another because a single show on stage isn't going to really lead us anywhere. \n\nIt's like they can't imagine the big picture or suggest a way of expanding things. I ask if they know this is longterm, not some one-shot scene. They say yes but then after my in-depth ideas, they only come back with 1-2 sentences. You know you feel the mood hitting a lull and it's like. Come on. I should not be pulling teeth here. But it's been like that for many of my RPs lately, where I'm stuck doing a lot of the legwork and not finding anyone to be an equal or to at least carry the mental load for a bit. I know life is tough for us, for so many reasons, right now. But sometimes looking for someone to mesh with, feels so lonely and disheartening.\n\nI have this craving, am willing to do 80% of the work, happy to meet people halfway or double up, but it's such a struggle lately. \n\nI'm probably going to explain to this guy that we're probably not on the same page which is such a shame. I almost feel like the same person is replying to my ads every couple of days and then bailing on me when I get excited. \n\nUrgh. \n\nAny ideas on how you guys try to make sure your partner pulls their weight or do you, like me, would rather call it quits before it becomes too cumbersome?",

            "selftext": "I've just remembered this story, and oh boy did I get annoyed. Before I jump into the story, I'd just like to add that my pronouns are she/her. Also, since I have a bad memory and can't remember what my ocs name was, I'll be referring to them as Ash for story and gender neutral purposes.\n\nSurprise, surprise, this is another Shadowhunters group, a different group to the one mentioned in my first post on this sub, though. This story takes place quite a while after I'd joined the community, and at one point, I thought it would be fun to make a transgender, non-binary character who used they/them pronouns.\n\nNow, for those who are unaware, the Shadowhunter community, within the books and other media (namely, the TV show), aren't too welcoming when it comes to LGBTQ+ members, take for example the character of Alec Lightwood. Despite this, however, the people within the chat were fine with it, which was great.\n\nI did have to remind people once or twice to please use the correct pronouns for my character, they'd apologise and do their best to use they/them pronouns when referring to my character from that point on.\n\nHowever.\n\nThere was one member of the group, I'll name them Carter, who consistently used the incorrect pronouns when talking about, and sometimes even to, my character. Now, I understand accidentally slipping up, or having only been told once or twice, but I would correct them pretty much every single time they would do this, and boy did I start getting irritated.\n\nObviously, I never wanted to show my annoyance when correcting them, I'd send my reply and then add a small ooc message afterwards that said something like:\n\n// hey, can you please use they/them pronouns when talking about my oc?\n\nAgain, they'd apologise, but it seemed like they would forget, no matter how many times I would politely remind them. Eventually, the chat started to die down, and I left. I'm glad I didn't leave the chat sooner, there were some good moments, but having to constantly remind the same person to do one simple thing, which they kept failing to do, was annoying, and not fun at all, I did not appreciate my oc being spoken about with the wrong pronouns being used.\n\nI don't believe the person doing this was doing it on purpose, at least I hope not, but I assume they, like myself, would not appreciate the incorrect pronouns being used towards, or about them, so why should a character you're roleplaying against be any different?",

            "selftext": "Yeah, I don't really know where to start so I guess I'll just get right into things. I don't know if anyone here has experienced or is experiencing the same thing, but I think I am much too reliant on roleplaying as an escape from the real world. Like, way too reliant. To the point where whenever I am not responding, I will be replaying scenes over and over in my head and imagining how to respond, thinking of new characters, new scenarios, so on and so forth. It's embarrassing to admit, but here I am. I have been writing for almost a decade now, it's been my number one hobby for at least that long. I deal with mental health-related problems, including social anxiety, so roleplaying serves as my \"interaction\" with others, even if those others are characters I concocted in my own mind. \n\nIn comes the partner. I have been writing with this person for the last 4 years, over these last 4 years we have created some amazing and heart-palpitatingly beautiful stories. And I am grateful for what we have been able to create. But as of lately, it doesn't seem as if she is as invested in everything as she used to be. The time between responses has increased, responses have become shorter, the characters she has brought to the table have decreased in substance (something that even she has acknowledged, this isn't me just shading her). I feel bad that I am growing increasingly resentful towards her for this because I know that everyone has real-world obligations and sometimes, roleplay has to be put on pause. This whole thing has really made me question my own relationship with roleplaying/writing, but it's also made me realize that because I've been more invested, I've been carrying the bulk of the writing. I'm always the one who has to come up with the plots/ideas, I'm the one who always provides the starters, I'm the one who always steps in and picks up the heavy lifting. And that's not fair. \n\nI don't know if it's time to walk away. I don't even know how to bring this up to her, or if any of this makes any sense. I am open to ideas and suggestions, especially if you've gone through anything remotely like this or are going through it. Shit's just not good at the moment.",

            "selftext": "There comes a point in every roleplayer's journey where you are negotiating the plot or arc of a story with a partner, and one or both of you runs out of creative steam.  In that moment, you shrug and type, \u201cLet's just see what happens.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, sometimes this is a very good thing.  With two published novels under my belt which nearly *ten entire people* have read, because they were on a free promotion once, I have done a fair amount of solo writing.  A tiny amount of it was even monetarily compensated, although certainly not to the point where I'm likely to quit the day job.  So I can authoritatively say that one of the charms of roleplaying online with a  partner as opposed to writing solo is that you never quite know what to expect.  Partnered writing, at its best, has the charm of endless spontaneity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe times when it is not a good idea to throw caution and structure to the wind, however, do exist, and a failure to acknowledge that fact has killed many a promising roleplay for me.  Sometimes what happens when you don't have a plan is that each of you expects the other to move the plot forward, and you both default to short, boring posts, each hoping the other writer will make something happen.  In a good roleplay you can pull out of this death spiral by rousing yourself sufficiently to do some OOC planning, even if it's just to the level of, \u201cHey, what if pirates attack the ship as they exit the wormhole?\u201d or \u201cHey, what if your character's undiagnosed respiratory problem is exacerbated by my character smoking?\u201d  Conflict, and therefore interest, have to come from somewhere.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd then there is the more insidious form of this trope.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA roleplayer agrees that you both want a roleplay with some romance, but not to dive directly into smut.  Instead you will play it out and let it develop naturally between the characters over the course of the larger plot.  And this agreement, in and of itself, is perfectly fine.  It's how I roleplay with writers that I've learned I can trust.  But the importuning stranger is not to be trusted in this manner, because to them, this means that they will keep hanging out sexual lures in-character from very early in the story with zero out-of-character discussion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy own policy, in these cases, is to respond with ignorance or repulsion from my characters that are the subject of these advances.  The writer almost always ghosts thereafter, because they are not getting what they wanted, and they won't ask for what they want.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy saddest example of this was a great writer.  I really enjoyed his future sci fi idea, and he was a very proficient character writer as well.  Our two characters were very opposite in type, mine a repressed aristocrat and his an earthy proletarian, and they were brought together when his psychic powers saved her from a lethal vehicle accident.  As it turned out, he lived with two other people in a group marriage, something the author had not previously discussed with me.  The result of this was that he brought the injured aristo home and then promptly got into the shower with one of them.  The other one drugged my character, both for anesthetic purposes and to attempt to loosen her tongue, and the following exchange occurred:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cWhy did you crash? And why in a poor part of town?\u201d Vicka inquired impatiently, as the other woman became entranced by the applied dermal. Tazadrine, or The Devil, a moderately dissociative opioid with a pitifully insipid moniker. Supposedly, Taz's tendency to make the user spit, speak in gibberish and feel the room spin was reminiscent of some old world animated character. \u201cAnswer quickly, they both cum fast in the shower.\u201d \u00a0\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother casual sexual reference.  It was all very peculiar.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCelerian looked blankly past Vicka for about a half-second as she calculated.  The drug was already heavily tamped down by her own countermeasures, mostly aggressive receptor-antagonists that would bind preferentially to almost anything.  The receptor antagonists were released based on a hormone cascade controlled by Kelly's access to her nervous system. The terecine cascade methodology was proprietary to Jelleken LTD; the hormone terecine did not exist in the normal human body, although similar concepts had been independently developed by other Corps for their own members.  She would feel slightly euphoric for a while as dopamine/serotonin reuptake was also inhibited, but she could stay on top of that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cI was not operating the CelJe manually.  The route was programmed,\u201d she began calmly.  \u201cThere were two jackers with unlicensed gravitic control modifications waiting at an intersection.  They brought down the car, and then Slip intervened, killed one and injured the other.  He helped me get out, and then I was forced to defend us both from the survivor using the CelJe.  One of their jammers has not yet run out of power.  I expect it will be removed from range when Justice reaches them with an investigative team.  The CelJe's ownership will be easily determined at that point.\u201d  She sat up straighter, folding her hands in her lap.  \u201cIt will be safer for everyone if I can contact CorpSec before they decide I've been abducted.  I can prevent harm to all of you if they are already in charge before Justice backtracks either of us.  I don't shed DNA that sniffers can pick up, but I don't know about Slip.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVictoria found enough patience not to be at odds with Celerian's unassailable demeanor of calm. Even discussing a recent traumatic event, during which she had nearly lost her life, she seemed unfazed. She wondered idly which procedure Celerian had undergone to have her passion for life completely removed, which genecut had scooped all of the emotion out of her skull and replaced it with something as featureless as all the rest of her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are some different possible interpretations here.  One is that the other author is just trying to move the story forward by having this failed interrogation give the proles a reason to remember my character when she shows up again later.  Another, and I think the correct one, is that by this point he was already frustrated with the lack of titillation I was providing him, and hanging out these teases to try and get me more involved in the part of the story he wanted me to engage with most: a sexy group marriage scenario, talk of shower sex, drugs that are intended to erode the character's reserve.  What actually happened is that my character's internal technology prevented her from getting too sloppy, and then she went home.  Out of character, I was startled that he had not even discussed the group marriage with me, because that was a dealbreaker as regarded any future romance; I wasn't playing someone poly, I was playing someone so repressed that a single physically present lover would be a huge step all on its own.  The result was that I firmly shut down any possible reaction from my character that would have given him what he wanted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe roleplay gradually petered out after that.  It had run for 22 pages and only made it to 36 in the record I've saved, all of that time the two characters playing out their own subplots detached from one another.  This encounter marks the point where it all went downhill right up to the point where he ghosted me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've always thought it was because he wanted more out of the roleplay sexually, but instead of talking to me about it ooc, he kept trying to sneak it into the story without consent or discussion.  And, that being the case, I shut him down hard, because that's what I always do when this happens.  Realize, flailing sexual imagery at your partner in an attempt to get them to respond to you is not letting things happen as they will.  It is trying to force the other writer into the scenario you want without having to discuss it with them.  The correct way to introduce sexual content into a roleplaying scenario is with discussion, full consent, and full disclosure.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere's an extent to which characters can take on a life of their own; but nobody is making an author write that a character's pussy is wet, or that their cock is hard.  The spirit of the prophets, as they say, is subject to the prophets.  We, the writers, are completely in control of whether we choose to write scenarios or internal narratives with sexual connotations.  We, the writers, are completely in control of the point where a platonic relationship becomes romantic, or a romantic relationship becomes sexual.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n In contrast to the sad story above, there is another roleplayer that I've been writing with for around a year, over several stories with beginnings, middles, and conclusions, and all of these stories had a fair amount of overt smut.  Both of us agreed there would be overt smut, and when it would happen, and how.  There was never and is never any dancing around the issue of consent, or what either of us wants, so neither of us has either cockblocked or ghosted the other (at least as far as I know).  At this point I trust this player not to push me toward that part of the story before I'm ready.  He, I hope, accords me the same trust.  There may be a point where we cease to write together, for all things must end, but it will not be over a communication of consent issue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe most important message here is for the young or new roleplayer: ask for what you want.  If you don't, you are far less likely to get it.  Be a negotiator, don't be a creeper.  And most of all, be clear, be consensual, and take responsibility for the content and intent of your own writing.",

            "selftext": "  \nMy server is not for freeform writers.   \n\n\nI get it. That's 100% okay with me.   \n\n\nI love rules. I love heavy lore where the whole world is fleshed out. I love restrictions. I love rigidity and uniformity. That shit gets me rocks off, so fucking hard.   \n\n\nBut I get that not everyone is that way. I'd love it if I could find a dozen new people who love rules as much as I do to come into my server, but I get that most players are freeform and want a world that's just bones so they can be part of building it. That's totally fine.   \n\n\nMy server caters to my demographic. My demographic is niche. It's tiny. It's itty-mf-bitty. But to those of us that like it? It's litty-mf-titty.   \n\n\nThis girl I knew from another server tried to recruit me into hers. I explained that cars and biker gangs weren't my preferred genre, but I was flattered she thought of me. She insisted, so I said I was just tapped out with my own server. She asked to join. I explained that it was probably not her bag and I didn't want her to think our friendship depended on her joining.   \n\n\nShe insisted. I linked her.   \n\n\nShe humble bragged, both instantly and non-stop, to my players, who proceeded to roll their eyes and DM jokes to me about what she was saying. She flexed how she \"regularly hits 3k characters per post,\" which for my mostly-novella writers wasn't much, honestly. But beyond that, we genuinely didn't care. As long as you give good content, who gives a shit how many ***letters*** are in your posts? No one I know, that's for sure.    \n\n\nThen she explained that she \"**explodes creativity**.\" But then her application was a culmination of every overdone clich\u00e9 the server had ever seen. Not only that, half of it wasn't allowed because it was already being done by another character and we don't let in copying arcs (we find that copy arcs or copy characters sparks OOC drama).   \n\n\nFinally she sends me this:  \n**Her**: It'd be a fun server to write in, it's just not fun to get into.\n\n**Me**: No worries at all. I told you it was difficult, it's not for everyone and that's okay!\n\n**Her**: I can definitely do it easily. It's just too restrictive for my creativity.\n\n**Me**: Of course! Our demographic is people who like heavy lore which comes with heavy restrictions. Plenty of writers prefer freeform like you.\n\n**Her**: I like heavy lore, but this is a bit much. \n\n**Me**: Yeah, most freeform players think so.\n\n**Her**: I mean that your server goes overboard.\n\n**Me**: Yeah, most freeform players think so.  \n\n\nWe went back and forth like that for a while, with me responding each time with \"yeah, most freeform players think so.\" Admittedly, I knew what she was trying to do by then, so I was trolling a bit.   \n\n\nTo be clear, we are really restrictive. It's definitely a thing. She's not wrong. My server will be 3 years old in February. A lot of story has happened, so a lot of lore has been added to showcase how it's grown. Freeform players aren't, and have never been, our demographic. We don't hate on them. Freeform play is the bedrock of RP. It's just not us.  \n\n\nNot every server or story is going to fit you, people. That's okay. RP is not a one-size-fits-all. Why is it so hard to just see that something isn't fun for you and leave? Why do players feel the need to bash the story on their way out? \n\n  \nHonestly though, if you're going to \"explode creativity\" on me, at least by me dinner first.",

            "selftext": "Our story begins in a server I created. Now, this man joins, and we immediately get a warning from someone who didn't invite him. Apparently, he's difficult.\n\nHow difficult could he be, I thought? I thought wrong. \n\nSo, this man... he wants his character exactly the way he wants it. Now, we wouldn't normally have a problem with that- \n\nif his character wasn't horrible in every category, from him not reading our systems \\[stats, rules, caps, bans.\\] to him wanting everything in the book \\[EMS, Snake Sage Mode, Rinnegan, Rinnesharingan, Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu, Lightning Release: Overdrive.\\]\n\n*\" And honeslty. EMS is MORE than enough for me to be content, but I need Something to hang ahead of me or I derail.\"*\n\nHe submitted a character at the END of any character development track. He submitted it at the end of the combat development track! You need something to hang ahead of you?! Go Genin! Don't submit someone that needs the most powerful things in the world as a way to progress.\n\nTo explain, we hold people to a certain standard when they're applying for a certain rank. We also have basic combat RP rules in place \\[These will come into play later in the story.\\] but we're not entirely combat-RP oriented, we're story-oriented. However, we often like to make it so that things are fair, people are equal depending on what rank they start out as.\n\nHis first submission is trash. He said that his goal was to create a not-edgy Uchiha. He created a very edgy Uchiha with an easy ticket to EMS- his five-year-old son, who watches his mother die, had 3T at 5 years old, and gets MS from that--- then promptly dies. The people who killed him don't try to take his eyes, for some reason. Now, not only is this ridiculous \\[3T is three tomoe. You start at one tomoe. 3T at 13 isn't believable, let alone 5.\\] it's also an extreme break of our rules in which nobody starts out with that particular ability. \n\nOn top of that, he has Kage-level stats, to begin with \\[strongest level you can achieve, capped to FIVE people, leaders\\]. I spent about two hours talking to him before he submitted his bio and he submitted it at a level that made me feel my words were useless. It took three renditions of his bio \\[because his story was terrible.\\] He was a prodigy, who somehow wasn't a prodigy, and did really well even when he didn't try all that hard. He did things effortlessly! He became Jonin at 15! \\[high rank.\\] And somehow, for some reason, when he was out of the village, they murdered his family; according to THIS STATEMENT.\n\n*\"As for killing his family. This Village knew they can't take him directly so they targeted his family to hopefully demoralize him. Simply because they were afraid he was getting too strong. Think of it like a black market bingo book? Maybe? Not so much that he had done anything wrong. Although it's certainly possible some missions have had him eliminate enemy ninja.\"*\n\nNo! That's not a good reason for your character to have slaughtered an entire village! That's just a plot device for MS! After that, he went and slaughtered the small village that killed his family, even though it was only one or two. Why would they target his family? Where are the details? Demoralize him? He's not even amongst the top bracket of the server! And what I'm going to tell you next will prove he shouldn't have even gotten the rank he did. \\[ He has severe main character ego. \\]\n\nBut. \n\nThen came his very first action in roleplay.\n\nHe's been in prison for *five. Years. His mass-murdering of a village, and innocents, considered a war-crime, put him there.* \n\nHokage comes to visit the man. \\[ Strongest person in the village. \\]\n\nHe challenges her to an immediate duel. \n\nSo. She says, \"Are you sure? I don't think it's a good idea.\"\n\nHe says, \"For honor!\" \n\nAnd then proceeds to waste seven hours of my time. \n\nHow? \n\nWell, I'll tell you how.\n\nFight starts off with prep. Five posts, I don't attack, he's attacking, my Hokage is much faster than him so she's just playing with him. She finally uses her strongest, fastest move- she's still not attacking. Her first attack is to unseal a sea of fire from one of her sealing cubes \\[portable hidey-holes that you can keep things in, basically.\\] and he uses a wind release move on it.\n\nThat is when everything goes to shit.\n\nYou see, Fire Release is strong against Wind Release, as Fire Release takes Wind Release and becomes stronger, hits harder and faster. He was in the direct path of my attack. Flames consumed him. Unfortunately, one must PREP dodges, here, as they are jutsu. Basic combat roleplay rules. Apparently, he used one of my sealing cubes, something tethered to me, as a substitution jutsu. That fails because they're steeped in my chakra. \n\nHe immediately bullshits a plan B. Dodges again when I deny his substitution. Usually, when you deny a dodge, it's a hit. He spends seven hours arguing about how it was a distraction. No, it was a basic mistake, especially with a nature match-up. \n\n[Ugh.](https://preview.redd.it/ej60a8cxvov51.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=981d70ba50bc384b2e02b5ca997946c7ee044a1c)\n\nHe screwed up. He would not accept his screw up. He went full 'this is mine, I decide what happens, not you.'\n\nHe's sorely out of training, has barely moved for five years. He would have lost by a landslide. But the point is, he used an attack that strengthened mine, FAILED TO DODGE AFTER A DODGE HE DIDN'T EVEN SET UP, and- You know what? Let me SHOW YOU. So you can judge it for yourself. \n\nWhat you will see is;\n\n\\- Not setting up a dodge.\n\n\\- Trying to control my weaponry without asking me what it does or if it would even succeed with no ability that would allow him to.\n\n\\- Dodging again, for severe levels of bullshit.\n\nI am white. He is red. \n\n[Or did he? He distracted with a wind-based technique.](https://preview.redd.it/ngh8d5pywov51.png?width=849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d2d8bb011dca3c5ffb127638ca216beb094210c)\n\n[GREAT  FIRE AHNILLIATION! He's out of practice, not using handsigns is known to be a mastery ability. Five years out of practice, you'd HAVE to use handsigns. My character is NOT out of practice and the release of her Sealing Cubes have a perk in which the commands are mental as the element of surprise is literally her ONLY way to fight. Even so, even though I have the option for solely mental commands, I have it so she has a tic where she touches her sealing cubes when she wants to do something with them.](https://preview.redd.it/8wy4eq48xov51.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb6c3f11129a58f3aa45456e15c2924b4fd938e3)\n\n[Good thing he had totally planned plan B! Totally! Apparently, because his other dodge failed, according to him it's an action he never took, so he could take an entirely different one? ](https://preview.redd.it/257sol9nxov51.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c621f0eab4362ef0398df2854bc19a0c1f9fa422)\n\nWhere was the handsigns? He acted like he had three hands. He does not. \n\nBut in the end, the moral of this story is I should never accept an edgy Uchiha again. \n\n[There's a reason why our lord and saviour Tobirama wanted all of these Uchiha scum dead. It's funny because he encompasses everything Uchiha are seen as in the community, and he drags down the name of what can be a pretty good character as a whole.](https://preview.redd.it/zsg32i70yov51.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cef4faa1f9279c8b42b7672d66d9f7467dcddff4)\n\nAnyways. \n\nHappy hunting. I've hit my burnt Uchiha quota for the day. Wasn't even going to kill him, but fighting a Hokage who doesn't know how to hold back isn't the smartest idea when you're kicking off five years of rust. Take a loss, own up to your mistakes, y'know? I hate killing characters. I avoid it whenever possible. He made it hard to avoid, and yet I still managed somehow.",
