We link up for Discord, start discussing things like kinks and such. I have little to no limits, but if it's something I don't see myself finding pleasure in I won't do that either. This guy wanted to tickle me. I personally just don't find tickling sexual, so I told him I'm not really up for that. He then said it's a ***requirement*** and if I won't do it then he won't rp. Guess he's not getting his pp hard tonight, I hopped off that train real quick.   \n\n\nI've had a lot of people have requirements, like Male Female, or they want to be submissive, character has to be a certain height(for people who don't want any pedo vibes from super short characters), and so on. I've never once heard of a guy not roleplay because he can't ***TICKLE*** me. I got a good laugh out of that.",

            "selftext": "Sometimes and rp slowly dies out and hey it stinks, but it happens. I was really disappointed the other day when I made a fantastic idea with someone, we were both hyped to start, and then they vanished. As much as I hate to say it, if you roleplay, you have to expect that to some extent. There's some good eggs out there, and I'm fortunate enough to have servers with several so I've always got a place to write at the end of the day.  \n\n\nBut this. RPer. I'll call her R. R and I became fast friends, we wrote multiple stories together, and I've known R for months.  R opened up about their mental illnesses, and I've had my own struggles with depression and anxiety. However, after weeks and on our third or fourth RP, they messaged me saying they were having a mental breakdown, then poofed and stop responding. I panicked. They made it sound like they were going to do something horrible, like end up in the emergency room hospital horrible. I called them, messaged them, asked them to let me know what was going on...and then they came back a day later saying 'oh yea i'm fine.'  \n\n\nI asked them to please not leave me hanging like that if they can, because seriously, I had a panic attack worrying about them. We weren't just roleplayers, but good friends. We talked on the phone a lot- her saying 'i'm having a mental break' then not responding for a day was terrifying because I thought they were going to get hurt.  \nShe apologized for scaring me and for a while, things seemed good.  \n\n\nThen she did it again. 'I'm in the hospital' and poof. She was in there for covid symptoms, but I didn't know. She told me nothing and again, vanished for hours after that message. I was worried for her, scared, and she didn't tell me what was going on until ages after she was discharged. I was frustrated, and needed a break, because I felt like she just liked seeing me panic for her. I told her it couldn't happen again.  \n\n\nBut SURPRISE it did. It happened again last night, saying 'i'm so scared about my health' then vanishing when I asked what was wrong. I think she just savors seeing my messages of 'oh man are you okay?' or something. Because I know she sees them. And it effing hurts. I want to be there for her and help. If she doesn't want me to help, that's okay, but then she shouldn't tell me she's having a break with no context so I'm sitting here, worried, assuming the worst. I just can't anymore. I told her that much this morning. The story isn't worth it. I can't.",

If it was more extreme(as I've done an rp like so before) such as 12-15in, or maybe if he's a guy who prefers to have a small one, who knows? \nHe then says \"that's kind of weird...\" I ask why and he says because it's a fictional character. \nOh, so it's okay to ask for a FOOT LONG TONGUE. Jee, wonder why they'd ask for that. Hmmm. \nBut the second I ask to know a size they can choose so I can give an accurate reply, I'm the weird one.

            "selftext": "Hi! This is my first post in this subreddit. And my first post on Reddit too, actually! \n\nI am a fiction writer and a roleplayer on several platforms, but my favorite was Facebook groups and Quotev. I am an avid fan of action RPs, basically anything that sends adrenaline through the veins. \n\nAs such, I am actually quite used to character archetypes such as vengeful assassins (Scorpion, anyone?), or vigilante wanting to do good. So one day a funny idea came to my mind... \n\nI have been trying to broaden my RP horizons, but forums and Discord just weren't fitting for me. So based on a Tumblr friend's suggestion, I decided to head to Omegle as she suggested and tried roleplaying there to find new partners. \n\nIf Roleplay was the Bible, here came Hell. If Roleplay was Mortal Kombat, here came the Netherrealm. \n\nOut of every ten people on Omegle, literally nine-and-a-half wanted nothing but purely erotic roleplays. And not even good erotic roleplays, no. Just a disclaimer, even though I identify as a grey-ace, I am happy to write erotic scenes occassionally, and I do get slightly... interested, I shall say, reading them sometimes. But no. You must be ten kinds of messed up if you are interested in roleplays with these possible neckbeards or incels who had nothing to do but ask for badly written porn. \n\nThe guys I ever RP'ed with in Omegle roleplays was an insufferable powergamer, and controlled my (off-the-top-of-the-head) OC every other post. Some would say I gave them a handjob, a kiss, or a blowjob without me ever saying so, and some also controlled my OC's appearance (at one point giving her an 8-pack). Why did I stick around, you ask? Let's reference back to the assassin/vigilante point above.  \n\nYou see, I wanted to mess with them. So I would pretend to go with the flow, and then, at the point when I thought they were seriously invested during a sex scene (usually several more moves until the climax), I suddenly turned into some kind of horrible beings and killed their \"character\" (if those count as characters to begin with) mid-RP. I often get creative. Sometimes I turn into old male sorcerers wanting to absorb men's vitality for immortality (Shang Tsung, dudes!). Sometimes I turn into a serpent. And most recently, a few months ago, I turned into a demon and burned one to death (and auto-hitting it, I couldn't care less when it comes to them) mid-RP. Their reaction was priceless. \n\nI will provide screenshots if anyone is interested! And thanks if you have read up to this point and liked my small little rant about how bad some heterosexual guys (no discrimination, I have met some fantastic male writers, but in the list of bad RPers they are just strangely often the worst writers and most likely to ask for badly written sex) did it on Omegle, and how I plotted a mischievous game to use against them.",

            "selftext": "Good day all! Today\u2019s post isn\u2019t really a rant but rather needing advice. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for many years, and have grown to love the hobby of story and character building. I\u2019ve made amazing friends who have ultimately moved on with their lives, as one does. I guess I\u2019m just starting to feel discouraged? My inbox has been dry for some time, or I\u2019ve been hit up by people who clearly did not read my post and just give me smut. \n\nAt this point in my life, all I really do is work and go home due to COVID, and my mental health has been in a decline, so roleplay was an escape to drift off into more pleasant worlds. But I\u2019m finding myself with only one roleplayer who isn\u2019t the most active (no judgement as I realize people have lives).\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering if anyone has or is in this position and what they do to feel better? I really don\u2019t want this to come off as woe is me or fishing for sympathy, I just feel myself in a rut and want to get myself out of it. \n\nAt any rate, thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day! You are wonderful and loved! \ud83d\udc95",

            "selftext": "In my short 3 years of RP\u2019ing on various Amino\u2019s, I think I\u2019ve already seen a bulk of the bad that occasionally creeps in with the good.\n\n\nI mostly RP to play-test my writing and fan-fiction skills in action. I think I\u2019ve gotten quite good at it as well, many commenting on them that they get stories rolling and help put others in the spotlight.\n\n\nBut... *I don\u2019t do any Lemon scenarios.*\n\n\nAnybody that suggests RP\u2019ing with me and suggests the slightest bit of Lemon, can expect me to feel tricked and have any OC of mine waltz out the front door. I\u2019ve got nothing to find inside such a niche type of self-serving RP. It doesn\u2019t advance any of my OCs of which the majority are pure-minded minors anyway, and I\u2019ve had bad stuff happen to me ages ago that really don\u2019t need any re-enacting. Fade to Black exists, I can substitute the moment for that of a less lemon one like a simple date or simply a good talk on a walk, and PM\u2019ing doesn\u2019t give you an actively rooting audience to cheer you on or boo you away.\n\n\n*Hence, I don\u2019t do lemon.*\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n... but other Users might only want to Lemon RP. Even worse: perhaps they only want to do so with *you*. And you might not be in the mood for that, nor even want to ever do that.\n\n\nThey might not even ask for your OC\u2019s consent on the matter. Or you, as their owner!\n\n\nAnd that just fricken\u2019 **sucks.**\n\n\nI\u2019ve had that happen to me back on a now-deserted RP Amino. Paired with a year of RP experience less, the role of supporting Staff being one that includes sucking up to bad Users that don\u2019t always deserve your attention or handholding, having a terrible narcissistic hypocrite for an Agent, and having such peeves\u2019 behaviour be enabled by the very Agent himself...\n\n\nThat\u2019s the story I want to tell you all about today.\n\n\n*CASTING CALL*\n\n\n* Me/Navy: Your one and only navy-blue ninja.\n\n* Dr. Elizabeth Diana Lich: My morally gray Teacher OC, with ties to the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d Sci-Fi intellectual property, and my strongest OC at that without breaking any guidlines in place.\n\n* (OOC) \u201cTodd\u201d: The questionable User, and their very NSFW Lizard OC.\n\n* (OOC) Narc Agent: Owner of the RP Amino, bit of a hypocritical [bottom], doesn\u2019t make for a good supportive friend. He\u2019s barely in this story because he shouldn\u2019t even have been in it.\n\n* (OOC) Drake: A friend who\u2019s Cyborg Quartermaster OC accidentally stumbled upon this garbage fire of an RP and tried helping me out to extinguish is. He\u2019s a really cool dude, and definitely helped prevent this story from ending up in a horrible place.\n\n\n*(PS: Because narc Agent threw me out after a later fight regarding character assassination of the IRL kind, I can\u2019t access my old RP responses. Hence, only the responses of the others are as accurate as can be.)*\n\n\nSo a year ago, on this one lone hell-hole of an RP Amino, Curator me [then-17F] was chatting in the OOC Chat (Out-Of-Character) with some overseas Users. I was also at Summer Computer Camp at the time, so I made an effort to not ghost any RP\u2019ing Users whilst I had those two to three free WiFi hours. And, since the narc Agent himself really sucked at juggling arcs and keeping Users interested in his terrible Sue-centered stories, I also made an effort to interest Users in small and self-contained adventures, or get other Users\u2019 arcs kickstarted.\n\n\nEnter... Todd [then-16M, ironically younger], who had just personally asked me in the OOC if we can have one of our characters meet up in the Public RP Chats.\n\n\nHe\u2019s made a new OC, he said. One he was confident that I would approve, since I\u2019m a big *Whovian* (*Doctor Who* fan) and even have dedicated *homebrew* OCs and alien creatures of mine roaming the RP Amino. I do it to practice my fanfic screenplay writing, as I\u2019m planning to maybe do something big with small things.\n\n\nTodd says it\u2019s *inspired* of\u2019ve the Xenomorph. Red flag number one, no matter how much I also like Alien. Because those things are broken in and outside the original source material.\n\n\n... first of all, the Wiki is as unbalanced as a blackened Ancient Egyptian soul trying to weigh a *feather* to a **brick**:\n\n\n\u2022 Runs at half the speed of sound.\n\n\n\u2022 Has a stainless steel skin that is 100% bulletproof, despite being a fricken *plant creature.*\n\n\n\u2022 Has claws that can slash through any metal and the strength to level a house as if it\u2019s it\u2019s made out of paper.\n\n\n\u2022 Can continuously regenerate back health and lost everything beyond even limbs.\n\n\n\u2022 Has two tongues (specifically in the style of the two-mouthed Xenomorph), of which the second one spans 3.5 long meters and can inject their prey with whatever chemicals, hormones, even cells or atoms that it wants. *Every.*\n\n\n\u2022 Can explode spores from it\u2019s body with a variety of befuddling, numbing, increasing and mind-altering effects.\n\n\n\u2022 Can shapeshift at an instant into anyone or anything, not limited to their cosmetics, clothing, tattoos, piercings, fillings or prosthetics unlike say The Thing. Their original appearance is that of a sexy buff lizardman sorta alien thing.\n\n\n\u2022 Knows a melody that they can play through their whole body as to try and hypnotize their prey into \u201cwillingly giving up their body\u201d, and even affects the **deaf** due to only needing the vibrations to hit them. Can only snap out of it due to: extreme mental trauma, amnesia, hearing the reversed melody, or not hearing the melody for about *a whole week* if you\u2019re an average human.\n\n\n\u2022 Doesn\u2019t need food *nor water* to live. Only (occasional) sunlight. Which isn\u2019t how most plants work but sure.\n\n\n\u2022 And got a bunch of dead air under weaknesses.\n\n\n*Suffice to say that I wasn\u2019t happy seeing this being deemed \u201cNavy-proof\u201d.*\n\n\nSecond of all: I was *extremely* worried by the lone line reading something like:\n\n\n&gt; *\u201dThe [plant Xeno] species is endangered, due to not being able to [\u201cdance\u201d] with their own kin. Thus, they travel to other planets to try and find partners to [\u201cdance\u201d] with.\u201d*\n\n\nSomething tells me that their home planet ain\u2019t culturally function like the Gerudo, nor have ever even heard of less-but-still-disturbing reproduction farms...\n\n\nI sure as heck declined that horrid Wiki and left a message in the Staff chat going \u201cas long as this wiki isn\u2019t less OP and shies away from the R-rated side, do not approve.\u201d\n\n\n... turns out that it was deemed \u201cfine\u201d by the narc Agent himself, and that I was \u201coverreacting\u201d since he himself didn\u2019t really keep to the M-rated max rule he wrote himself anyway, no matter the 13-year olds roaming around this RP Amino who want nothing to do with it.\n\n\n*And that I make up for it by keeping to their request to RP with a certain, currently-female adult OC of mine.*\n\n\nPeer pressure be damned, I still bet this was a coop by the two since I did get Todd banned on the first Amino for PM\u2019ing me about *wanting to [\u201cforcefully thoroughly dance with\u201d] my minor girl Kid (SI)OC he planned to kidnap* to which I denied wholeheartedly due to **personal trauma** regarding that topic.\n\n\nI entered my FanDW OC in the Market Chat, her going by Dr. Elizabeth Diana Lich [3000+F, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s normal] back then (Lich for short).\n\n\nOne of the narc Agent\u2019s egocentric arcs was in motion, something about a serial killer who\u2019s out murdering mixed species/race romantic couples. The serial killer most likely wasn\u2019t even in the same town anymore, since the narc Agent \u201cconvinced\u201d another User to have her female Zorra-like OC hook up with his human SIOC, Lemon a bunch which led to very poorly drawn hentai the narc Agent couldn\u2019t accept an ounce of anatomical criticism of, and travel to some annual tournament you couldn\u2019t enter if your OC didn\u2019t have \u201cthe drive to go all out and win\u201d to get married after that. Suffice to say that the serial killer would most likely pull a Booth and try to kill them there.\n\n\nThen again **that tournament still hasn\u2019t ended yet** due to Users being bored to death and ghosting the place with fair enough reasons. Yes, even after a year of the tournament being in place. So... nobody really knows!\n\n\nI tried making the other Public RP areas more interesting for non-participating Users if there were a curfew after dark, with more opportunities for monster encounters made by the Users roaming the place and allowing them to start their own self-contained arcs if need be. Were they to ask the Staff that they want patrolling teachers to be an enemy to them, we could fix something like that up in no time. As in my eyes, in-character house rules are meant to be bend and a little broken.\n\n\nLich being a teacher at the town\u2019s academy with ulterior motives, she follows the rulebook and goes to patrol the Market at curfew to find any lost students or surprise any serial killers interfering with her nightly routine of roaming.\n\n\nEnter Todd\u2019s plant Xenomorph OC, having skinned some poor 16-year old boy alive on a ferry to town, identity stamped and their student credentials stolen to be memorized in their plant head. Roaming the place for 7 hours to try and fill knowledge gaps regarding how humans romance other humans.\n\n\nQuick reminder to say that despite looking like one, *Lich isn\u2019t human*. Being an OC to the *Doctor Who* universe, she\u2019s a Time Lady like the main protagonist of the show. Another one, Todd himself said that *Lich might know of his species* due to alien life forms, history and biology being her specialty.\n\n\nCurfew\u2019s started, and Lich runs into a very suspicious plant Xeno pretending to be a student.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cGood evening, pupil. And what are you planning to do at this hour?\u201d\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s OC: \u201c... oh! Just taking a nightly stroll, ma\u2019am!*\n\n\nI have her ask him for their card, and then blindly quiz them on their supposed identity. They get everything right, though, he claims to be a brand-new student when giving them a lie about having seen them before in her class which they deny (semi-metagamingly.)\n\n\nNow, how can a brand new student have physical student credentials which cannot be mailed to another planet due to the primitive system in places? Or have a definite schedule? Definite class? And not know of the curfew if they hadn\u2019t gone to the town and academy littered with info a human could understand about the curfew I put down *myself* when trying to get these credentials? Suffice to say that the original student had already properly enrolled and been put into a class on day one before they bit the dust.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Todd\u2019s OC, Lich can actually see their real name due to a feature she has from her own species\u2019 class. Asking the student for it, looking at them, and reading it from the shielded card, they don\u2019t match nor look all that human.\n\n\nIt was enough suspicion to have her think that this kid might be the serial killer, her writing in her own alien language a report about her suspicions.\n\n\nFortunately, another User I\u2019ll call Drake [15M] had their Quartermaster Cyborg OC [???NA, idk] enter the same chat for curfew duties. Them being a *cool dude Whovian* as well, the OC they played with was one from the same Time Lord civilization as Lich. Via a psychic ability that let\u2019s them link minds with consent, Lich shares a mental image of her report from a distance to inform them which he can read.\n\n\nThus, she and Drake\u2019s OC immediately ally, him staying back to step in if Todd\u2019s OC did something reckless.\n\n\nLich proceeds to ask Todd\u2019s OC in which dorm he stays. He denies staying in any, saying he instead rents an apartment in the area which is the final hit to his credibility as an honest student. Her tagging along with him due to the curfew rules, Todd\u2019s OC immediately dives into an alleyway and disappears from sight.\n\n\n*My suspicions about Todd\u2019s intentions with my OC have been confirmed.*\n\n\nHe wants to turn her into one of his \u201cdancing partners\u201d to \u201cdance with.\u201d Why? Most likely revenge. I did get him banned from a previous Amino regarding him asking to \u201cforcefully dance\u201d for a while with one of my minor OCs that had an \u201calive at all costs\u201d bounty on their head.\n\n\nOr perhaps not. It\u2019s just me speculating for a motive.\n\n\nDrake makes a move to have his OC jump down into the alleyway and surprise Todd\u2019s. However, Todd writes to have his OC already notice him in the past and disappear from even him.\n\n\nLich immediately mechanically transforms her sonic (as in sound) pen she had previously clipped inside her gilet\u2019s breastpocket into that of a sonic rapier, the tip being swapped out with that of a White Artron one; a sort of compressed specification of otherworldly radiation capable of piercing and slashing between atoms and thus through mostly anything if your speed, dexterity, defense and offense game is balanced correctly. I have her slash some white radioactive lines into the dark alleyway, as it actually illuminates them a good amount, and then prepare to get surprised by not moving another inch and assuming a position capable of parrying or sidestepping.\n\n\n... Todd then proceeds to have his OC autohit me, saying Lich couldn\u2019t possibly expect a shapeshifted camouflaged Xenomorph plant-like alien run at her at the speed of whipping up a self-contained storm to deeply cut her in her left shoulder.\n\n\nEven though she could have prevented the cut with her precision-based moveset with fencing inspiration, the alley being illuminated, her being prepared to dodge or parry, and actually also having an ability to alter her perception of time to give her mind more time to think and slightly alter her stances to react without a speed boost.\n\n\nTo rub even more salt into the autohit\u2019s wound, he ALSO says that he\u2019d \u201cshapeshifted his second tongue into a third claw, that **injected her with some of his \u201cseeds\u201d** and hence made her \u201ctoo sick to dance any further\u201d. The chemicals with it also injected to make her feel \u201ctremendously more in the mood to dance\u201d, \u201crapidly alter her body in significant ways for dancing\u201d but also paralyzing her dead in her tracks.\n\n\n... who the hell approved this again?! Oh right, the bribed narc Agent.\n\n\nIn OOC, I scolded him for not asking for consent, which he shrugged off by saying I \u201calready gave mine by accepting to RP\u201d. Everyone scolded him for the blatant auto-hit, and Drake dug through Lich\u2019s wiki regarding all her abilities and physical feats being able to see him coming. Like being able to see his OC\u2019s real name, being able to alter her time perception, her stance, her chemical resistances due to her past and species, etc. And I very much scolded him for not properly noting that this was the way he\u2019d get other OCs \u201ctoo sick to dance\u201d, as literally nothing states so and him saying that the victims who have to delivers an egg do that very much like how one delivers a baby.\n\n\nPlus, Lich\u2019s species is *100% infertile* beyond biological fixing! They have to re-loom their old corpses from raw biodata back to a recycled life if they want a kid that\u2019s already an adult. Not ever happening, and necrophilia isn\u2019t remotely my preferred \u201cshoe-size\u201d.\n\n\n**A shoulder wound isn\u2019t even remotely close enough to the area where that should all be genetically happening! I would know! I\u2019m a girl for god\u2019s sake!**\n\n\nOne redone wiki later, Todd\u2019s OC wiki now states that if their prey lose the fight, he\u2019ll have them \u201cdance\u201d with them *the usual way*. He\u2019s also weak to fire now, yay!\n\n\nSuffice to say though that the stakes of this battle have dramatically raised... *for the worse, in my case.*\n\n\nTo not have the OOC argue any longer, I have Lich accept the autohit minus the little \u201cpresent\u201d and stumble back into the well-lit Marketplace thanks to her stellar drug resistances. I have her sketch more White Artron radiation stuff on the floor in the shape of a broken-up sun-like pattern as she can then stay lit if the other lights go out, and perhaps use them for attacks due to an ability she has regarding this radiation.\n\n\nDrake meanwhile tries to beat up Todd\u2019s OC, using a flurry of aimed powerful punches augmented with Blue and Green Artron radiation to make them go faster and hit harder... but they all miss? Todd\u2019s OC shapeshifted around his punches? Drake then has their OC form a spear with Green Artron radiation, using his cybernetic parts to calculate how to throw it, and hopes that the radiation tremedously slows it down after being hit... but \u201cmajorly misses\u201d again?!\n\n\nThis is getting ridiculous...\n\n\nDrake\u2019s OC heads to the Marketplace as well, asking if she\u2019s alright and if she knows what they might be facing. She explains that she\u2019s fine, but more importantly, that these are all textbook tells of the \u201cvery much now infamous\u201d plant Xeno thanks to OOC Todd saying that she can have studied them before.\n\n\nAs she says that, Todd\u2019s OC returns. He\u2019s shapeshifted into... big tentacle... *[gags]*.\n\n\n*Sure*, big plant octopus thing spanning the entire goddamn Marketplace with the main alien on top. On the ends of some tentacles are shapeshifted ocarinas on the ends of them, playing the hypnotical melody, to more than try and woo Lich into becoming his \u201cdance partner\u201d. Chemical and psychic resistances++ still being disregarded by Todd, Drake and I got only 3 turns until Lich\u2019s done for. Drake\u2019s cyborg is luckily immune to the song due to being a bot.\n\n\nDrake attempts to destroy some of the tentacles and punch Todd\u2019s alien in the face, but again... misses somehow and the broken tentacles just immediately reform.\n\n\nOne thing that I didn\u2019t mention, is that establishing a psychic link means that all psychic interactions take place in PM. There, we try to form a plan that actually works.\n\n\nDrake suggests to punch the alien even harder and quicker, in hopes that it\u2019ll hit in one of the two remaining rounds. Not ever gonna happen of course, Todd doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to lose his unwilling waifu.\n\n\nBut! I then tell him of a secret weapon Lich has on her, also noted in her wiki, that one wouldn\u2019t be in the know of unless if they were told about it or got hit by it...\n\n\n**[TO BE CONTINUED IN PART 2 DUE TO WORD LIMIT AND READING COMFORT]**\n\n\n\u2014 Navy",

            "selftext": "Posting from a throwaway just in case. Also, English is not my first language. \n\n**TL;DR:** The title, basically.  \n\nA few months ago I made a new character account on the website where I usually RP. Let's call the character \"Bella\". She's a canon character from a movie that's a bit obscure, so it can be hard to find other people who RP it. One day I got an OOC message from another RPer, \"Skylar\", who offered to make an account for Bella's canon love interest, \"Tammy\". At that point I'd barely gotten any RP for Bella at all, and there didn't seem to be any other Tammy accounts around, so I happily accepted.\n\nSkylar's portrayal of Tammy wasn't the most... accurate (as bad as I feel saying that, knowing mine probably isn't the best either). But other than that they seemed to be a decent writer, and a really nice person OOC, so I wasn't complaining.\n\nWhen I first met Skylar, Bella was the only character account I had. But as time went by, I slowly got around to making more. Mostly canon characters from different movies and TV shows, but also a couple OCs. Almost every time I made a new account, Skylar would make (without me asking them to) a partner for them. This meant my canon character accounts would get their canon love interest, while my OCs would each be paired up with one of Skylar's.\n\nIt was all pretty nice at first. But I soon found myself losing 'muse' for most of my accounts. Getting bored. Not really wanting to be around if Skylar was. I did still RP with them, but simply wasn't enjoying it anymore, and couldn't quite put my finger on why. \n\nThen one day we were RPing as usual. We were each using one of our OCs, Skylar's being a girl named \"Leah\". Leah's faceclaim was the same actress who plays the aforementioned Tammy, and at the time Skylar had the exact same profile picture on both characters' accounts. Anyway, while we were RPing, I had to do a double take to see if it was actually Leah and not Tammy that my OC was supposed to be talking to. I think the moment it really hit me was when I realized it wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway, because no matter what my OC did or said, she would've gotten pretty much the same response from either character. *Because they were written the exact same way*. \n\nThe same went for the rest of the characters they played. From that point on, I payed closer attention and actually noticed: \n\n* how shallow and generic Skylar's characters' responses usually were. \n* how we were pretty much doing the exact same 'storylines' (if you can call them that, since what they wrote rarely went much deeper than \"Hi \\*smiles\\*\") with all of our ships.\n* how the only time they seemed to put in a little (and I mean *a little*) more effort was when we were writing smut (which I'm not *opposed* to, but it's not what I want to be doing all the time).\n* how I couldn't think of a single defining trait for any of their OCs.\n* how they actually didn't seem to know much about most of the canon characters they'd been playing, almost as if they'd never even watched the movie/TV show they were from.\n\nLooking back, it was always this way, too. Even when we only had Bella and Tammy. I guess I didn't see it because I was just so excited to have actually found someone to play Tammy. But I really, really wish I had. It should've been the first sign to end with things with them, or at least not get *this* involved.\n\nSkylar is a lovely person who I've come to consider a friend. But when it comes to RPing with them... I don't know anymore. I'd honestly like to break off our ships because (again, I feel bad for saying this at all) I feel like their characters are just kind of holding mine down at this point. But again, I really do care about them and don't want to hurt their feelings. \n\nAnd well, that's about it. I hope it made sense, and didn't make me sound like an elitist or something. I honestly don't know how I let it get to this point, or if I'm posting this looking for advice or just to vent. Either way, if anyone has any similar stories, I'd love to hear them!",

            "selftext": "Hey back with another Rp story.\n\nThis one is a bit more recent and lasted the span of 6 months. Back in January 2020 I had joined a grp after seeing a post in a Facebook group. It was an Asylum based rp. After I had joined people were still pairing up for ships, making ocs and expanding info as needed. There was no official ships yet so my oc (Beatrix) and another oc (Dean) were chatting while he flirted with her. This is where it started. Another girl in the chat (Lets call her Annabel) wanted her oc (Abigail) with Dean. Even though there had been no romantic interactions between them (Dean and Abigail) Annabel decided to spread rumors about my oc and have all the other ocs gang up on my oc. Over a guy. Eventually Annabel added a girl we will call SheDemon.\nI stayed in the rp and our little group made more rps. SheDemon had been going out of her way to target my ocs (which if we had both agreed on I wouldn't have minded but I refused and she didn't listen) and in our OOC chat SheDemon and Annabel would wait till only the 3 of us were active to start bringing up old rp drama. One of my ocs didn't like Annabel's oc due to how severely immature she was and how she acted like a Mary Sue constantly getting hurt and everyone fawning over her. My oc would make a comment like \"You do realize throwing yourself on the floor and crying like a baby wont fix your problems right?\" And they held onto it for months. Even after discussing it 5+ times they would bring it back up resulting in arguments over my right to not like an oc. The two would private message the others saying I was mean and when the others checked the main thing they would see is me angry at them. So for months I held my tongue. I would rp less because I didn't like how my ocs and I were treated. Slowly our group dispersed. SheDemon and Annabel would force rp drama and if someone said they didn't want to do it they would get mad and say something like \"Ive only had 40 minutes of sleep and you're triggering my PTSD!\" (Not how PTSD works but they liked to pretend to be mentally ill) Now its just me and the guy who played Dean, who is now my husband. \nThis was a summary of the 6 months of hell they gave me. But in the end, I got a husband who i love and understands why I refuse to rp with those 2 girls.\n\nSo to the girls who lied about me, manipulated people, started drama 24/7, pretend to have mental illnesses, and made me almost quit rping: lets not meet again, I might use my taser on you.",

Even worse: perhaps they only want to do so with *you*. And you might not be in the mood for that, nor even want to ever do that.\n\n\nThey might not even ask for your OC\u2019s consent on the matter. Or you, as their owner!\n\n\nAnd that just fricken\u2019 **sucks.**\n\n\nI\u2019ve had that happen to me back on a now-deserted RP Amino. Paired with a year of RP experience less, the role of supporting Staff being one that includes sucking up to bad Users that don\u2019t always deserve your attention or handholding, having a terrible narcissistic hypocrite for an Agent, and having such peeves\u2019 behaviour be enabled by the very Agent himself...\n\n\nThat\u2019s the story I want to tell you all about today.\n\n\n*CASTING CALL*\n\n\n* Me/Navy: Your one and only navy-blue ninja.\n\n* Dr. Elizabeth Diana Lich: My morally gray Teacher OC, with ties to the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d Sci-Fi intellectual property, and my strongest OC at that without breaking any guidlines in place.\n\n* (OOC) \u201cTodd\u201d: The questionable User, and their very NSFW Lizard OC.\n\n* (OOC) Narc Agent: Owner of the RP Amino, bit of a hypocritical [bottom], doesn\u2019t make for a good supportive friend. He\u2019s barely in this story because he shouldn\u2019t even have been in it.\n\n* (OOC) Drake: A friend who\u2019s Cyborg Quartermaster OC accidentally stumbled upon this garbage fire of an RP and tried helping me out to extinguish is. He\u2019s a really cool dude, and definitely helped prevent this story from ending up in a horrible place.\n\n\n*(PS: Because narc Agent threw me out after a later fight regarding character assassination of the IRL kind, I can\u2019t access my old RP responses. Hence, only the responses of the others are as accurate as can be.)*\n\n\nSo a year ago, on this one lone hell-hole of an RP Amino, Curator me [then-17F] was chatting in the OOC Chat (Out-Of-Character) with some overseas Users. I was also at Summer Computer Camp at the time, so I made an effort to not ghost any RP\u2019ing Users whilst I had those two to three free WiFi hours. And, since the narc Agent himself really sucked at juggling arcs and keeping Users interested in his terrible Sue-centered stories, I also made an effort to interest Users in small and self-contained adventures, or get other Users\u2019 arcs kickstarted.\n\n\nEnter... Todd [then-16M, ironically younger], who had just personally asked me in the OOC if we can have one of our characters meet up in the Public RP Chats.\n\n\nHe\u2019s made a new OC, he said. One he was confident that I would approve, since I\u2019m a big *Whovian* (*Doctor Who* fan) and even have dedicated *homebrew* OCs and alien creatures of mine roaming the RP Amino. I do it to practice my fanfic screenplay writing, as I\u2019m planning to maybe do something big with small things.\n\n\nTodd says it\u2019s *inspired* of\u2019ve the Xenomorph. Red flag number one, no matter how much I also like Alien. Because those things are broken in and outside the original source material.\n\n\n... first of all, the Wiki is as unbalanced as a blackened Ancient Egyptian soul trying to weigh a *feather* to a **brick**:\n\n\n\u2022 Runs at half the speed of sound.\n\n\n\u2022 Has a stainless steel skin that is 100% bulletproof, despite being a fricken *plant creature.*\n\n\n\u2022 Has claws that can slash through any metal and the strength to level a house as if it\u2019s it\u2019s made out of paper.\n\n\n\u2022 Can continuously regenerate back health and lost everything beyond even limbs.\n\n\n\u2022 Has two tongues (specifically in the style of the two-mouthed Xenomorph), of which the second one spans 3.5 long meters and can inject their prey with whatever chemicals, hormones, even cells or atoms that it wants. *Every.*\n\n\n\u2022 Can explode spores from it\u2019s body with a variety of befuddling, numbing, increasing and mind-altering effects.\n\n\n\u2022 Can shapeshift at an instant into anyone or anything, not limited to their cosmetics, clothing, tattoos, piercings, fillings or prosthetics unlike say The Thing. Their original appearance is that of a sexy buff lizardman sorta alien thing.\n\n\n\u2022 Knows a melody that they can play through their whole body as to try and hypnotize their prey into \u201cwillingly giving up their body\u201d, and even affects the **deaf** due to only needing the vibrations to hit them. Can only snap out of it due to: extreme mental trauma, amnesia, hearing the reversed melody, or not hearing the melody for about *a whole week* if you\u2019re an average human.\n\n\n\u2022 Doesn\u2019t need food *nor water* to live. Only (occasional) sunlight. Which isn\u2019t how most plants work but sure.\n\n\n\u2022 And got a bunch of dead air under weaknesses.\n\n\n*Suffice to say that I wasn\u2019t happy seeing this being deemed \u201cNavy-proof\u201d.*\n\n\nSecond of all: I was *extremely* worried by the lone line reading something like:\n\n\n&gt; *\u201dThe [plant Xeno] species is endangered, due to not being able to [\u201cdance\u201d] with their own kin. Thus, they travel to other planets to try and find partners to [\u201cdance\u201d] with.\u201d*\n\n\nSomething tells me that their home planet ain\u2019t culturally function like the Gerudo, nor have ever even heard of less-but-still-disturbing reproduction farms...\n\n\nI sure as heck declined that horrid Wiki and left a message in the Staff chat going \u201cas long as this wiki isn\u2019t less OP and shies away from the R-rated side, do not approve.\u201d\n\n\n... turns out that it was deemed \u201cfine\u201d by the narc Agent himself, and that I was \u201coverreacting\u201d since he himself didn\u2019t really keep to the M-rated max rule he wrote himself anyway, no matter the 13-year olds roaming around this RP Amino who want nothing to do with it.\n\n\n*And that I make up for it by keeping to their request to RP with a certain, currently-female adult OC of mine.*\n\n\nPeer pressure be damned, I still bet this was a coop by the two since I did get Todd banned on the first Amino for PM\u2019ing me about *wanting to [\u201cforcefully thoroughly dance with\u201d] my minor girl Kid (SI)OC he planned to kidnap* to which I denied wholeheartedly due to **personal trauma** regarding that topic.\n\n\nI entered my FanDW OC in the Market Chat, her going by Dr. Elizabeth Diana Lich [3000+F, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s normal] back then (Lich for short).\n\n\nOne of the narc Agent\u2019s egocentric arcs was in motion, something about a serial killer who\u2019s out murdering mixed species/race romantic couples. The serial killer most likely wasn\u2019t even in the same town anymore, since the narc Agent \u201cconvinced\u201d another User to have her female Zorra-like OC hook up with his human SIOC, Lemon a bunch which led to very poorly drawn hentai the narc Agent couldn\u2019t accept an ounce of anatomical criticism of, and travel to some annual tournament you couldn\u2019t enter if your OC didn\u2019t have \u201cthe drive to go all out and win\u201d to get married after that. Suffice to say that the serial killer would most likely pull a Booth and try to kill them there.\n\n\nThen again **that tournament still hasn\u2019t ended yet** due to Users being bored to death and ghosting the place with fair enough reasons. Yes, even after a year of the tournament being in place. So... nobody really knows!\n\n\nI tried making the other Public RP areas more interesting for non-participating Users if there were a curfew after dark, with more opportunities for monster encounters made by the Users roaming the place and allowing them to start their own self-contained arcs if need be. Were they to ask the Staff that they want patrolling teachers to be an enemy to them, we could fix something like that up in no time. As in my eyes, in-character house rules are meant to be bend and a little broken.\n\n\nLich being a teacher at the town\u2019s academy with ulterior motives, she follows the rulebook and goes to patrol the Market at curfew to find any lost students or surprise any serial killers interfering with her nightly routine of roaming.\n\n\nEnter Todd\u2019s plant Xenomorph OC, having skinned some poor 16-year old boy alive on a ferry to town, identity stamped and their student credentials stolen to be memorized in their plant head. Roaming the place for 7 hours to try and fill knowledge gaps regarding how humans romance other humans.\n\n\nQuick reminder to say that despite looking like one, *Lich isn\u2019t human*. Being an OC to the *Doctor Who* universe, she\u2019s a Time Lady like the main protagonist of the show. Another one, Todd himself said that *Lich might know of his species* due to alien life forms, history and biology being her specialty.\n\n\nCurfew\u2019s started, and Lich runs into a very suspicious plant Xeno pretending to be a student.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cGood evening, pupil. And what are you planning to do at this hour?\u201d\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s OC: \u201c... oh! Just taking a nightly stroll, ma\u2019am!*\n\n\nI have her ask him for their card, and then blindly quiz them on their supposed identity. They get everything right, though, he claims to be a brand-new student when giving them a lie about having seen them before in her class which they deny (semi-metagamingly.)\n\n\nNow, how can a brand new student have physical student credentials which cannot be mailed to another planet due to the primitive system in places? Or have a definite schedule? Definite class? And not know of the curfew if they hadn\u2019t gone to the town and academy littered with info a human could understand about the curfew I put down *myself* when trying to get these credentials? Suffice to say that the original student had already properly enrolled and been put into a class on day one before they bit the dust.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Todd\u2019s OC, Lich can actually see their real name due to a feature she has from her own species\u2019 class. Asking the student for it, looking at them, and reading it from the shielded card, they don\u2019t match nor look all that human.\n\n\nIt was enough suspicion to have her think that this kid might be the serial killer, her writing in her own alien language a report about her suspicions.\n\n\nFortunately, another User I\u2019ll call Drake [15M] had their Quartermaster Cyborg OC [???NA, idk] enter the same chat for curfew duties. Them being a *cool dude Whovian* as well, the OC they played with was one from the same Time Lord civilization as Lich. Via a psychic ability that let\u2019s them link minds with consent, Lich shares a mental image of her report from a distance to inform them which he can read.\n\n\nThus, she and Drake\u2019s OC immediately ally, him staying back to step in if Todd\u2019s OC did something reckless.\n\n\nLich proceeds to ask Todd\u2019s OC in which dorm he stays. He denies staying in any, saying he instead rents an apartment in the area which is the final hit to his credibility as an honest student. Her tagging along with him due to the curfew rules, Todd\u2019s OC immediately dives into an alleyway and disappears from sight.\n\n\n*My suspicions about Todd\u2019s intentions with my OC have been confirmed.*\n\n\nHe wants to turn her into one of his \u201cdancing partners\u201d to \u201cdance with.\u201d Why? Most likely revenge. I did get him banned from a previous Amino regarding him asking to \u201cforcefully dance\u201d for a while with one of my minor OCs that had an \u201calive at all costs\u201d bounty on their head.\n\n\nOr perhaps not. It\u2019s just me speculating for a motive.\n\n\nDrake makes a move to have his OC jump down into the alleyway and surprise Todd\u2019s. However, Todd writes to have his OC already notice him in the past and disappear from even him.\n\n\nLich immediately mechanically transforms her sonic (as in sound) pen she had previously clipped inside her gilet\u2019s breastpocket into that of a sonic rapier, the tip being swapped out with that of a White Artron one; a sort of compressed specification of otherworldly radiation capable of piercing and slashing between atoms and thus through mostly anything if your speed, dexterity, defense and offense game is balanced correctly. I have her slash some white radioactive lines into the dark alleyway, as it actually illuminates them a good amount, and then prepare to get surprised by not moving another inch and assuming a position capable of parrying or sidestepping.\n\n\n... Todd then proceeds to have his OC autohit me, saying Lich couldn\u2019t possibly expect a shapeshifted camouflaged Xenomorph plant-like alien run at her at the speed of whipping up a self-contained storm to deeply cut her in her left shoulder.\n\n\nEven though she could have prevented the cut with her precision-based moveset with fencing inspiration, the alley being illuminated, her being prepared to dodge or parry, and actually also having an ability to alter her perception of time to give her mind more time to think and slightly alter her stances to react without a speed boost.\n\n\nTo rub even more salt into the autohit\u2019s wound, he ALSO says that he\u2019d \u201cshapeshifted his second tongue into a third claw, that **injected her with some of his \u201cseeds\u201d** and hence made her \u201ctoo sick to dance any further\u201d. The chemicals with it also injected to make her feel \u201ctremendously more in the mood to dance\u201d, \u201crapidly alter her body in significant ways for dancing\u201d but also paralyzing her dead in her tracks.\n\n\n... who the hell approved this again?! Oh right, the bribed narc Agent.\n\n\nIn OOC, I scolded him for not asking for consent, which he shrugged off by saying I \u201calready gave mine by accepting to RP\u201d. Everyone scolded him for the blatant auto-hit, and Drake dug through Lich\u2019s wiki regarding all her abilities and physical feats being able to see him coming. Like being able to see his OC\u2019s real name, being able to alter her time perception, her stance, her chemical resistances due to her past and species, etc. And I very much scolded him for not properly noting that this was the way he\u2019d get other OCs \u201ctoo sick to dance\u201d, as literally nothing states so and him saying that the victims who have to delivers an egg do that very much like how one delivers a baby.\n\n\nPlus, Lich\u2019s species is *100% infertile* beyond biological fixing! They have to re-loom their old corpses from raw biodata back to a recycled life if they want a kid that\u2019s already an adult. Not ever happening, and necrophilia isn\u2019t remotely my preferred \u201cshoe-size\u201d.\n\n\n**A shoulder wound isn\u2019t even remotely close enough to the area where that should all be genetically happening! I would know! I\u2019m a girl for god\u2019s sake!**\n\n\nOne redone wiki later, Todd\u2019s OC wiki now states that if their prey lose the fight, he\u2019ll have them \u201cdance\u201d with them *the usual way*. He\u2019s also weak to fire now, yay!\n\n\nSuffice to say though that the stakes of this battle have dramatically raised... *for the worse, in my case.*\n\n\nTo not have the OOC argue any longer, I have Lich accept the autohit minus the little \u201cpresent\u201d and stumble back into the well-lit Marketplace thanks to her stellar drug resistances. I have her sketch more White Artron radiation stuff on the floor in the shape of a broken-up sun-like pattern as she can then stay lit if the other lights go out, and perhaps use them for attacks due to an ability she has regarding this radiation.\n\n\nDrake meanwhile tries to beat up Todd\u2019s OC, using a flurry of aimed powerful punches augmented with Blue and Green Artron radiation to make them go faster and hit harder... but they all miss? Todd\u2019s OC shapeshifted around his punches? Drake then has their OC form a spear with Green Artron radiation, using his cybernetic parts to calculate how to throw it, and hopes that the radiation tremedously slows it down after being hit... but \u201cmajorly misses\u201d again?!\n\n\nThis is getting ridiculous...\n\n\nDrake\u2019s OC heads to the Marketplace as well, asking if she\u2019s alright and if she knows what they might be facing. She explains that she\u2019s fine, but more importantly, that these are all textbook tells of the \u201cvery much now infamous\u201d plant Xeno thanks to OOC Todd saying that she can have studied them before.\n\n\nAs she says that, Todd\u2019s OC returns. He\u2019s shapeshifted into... big tentacle... *[gags]*.\n\n\n*Sure*, big plant octopus thing spanning the entire goddamn Marketplace with the main alien on top. On the ends of some tentacles are shapeshifted ocarinas on the ends of them, playing the hypnotical melody, to more than try and woo Lich into becoming his \u201cdance partner\u201d. Chemical and psychic resistances++ still being disregarded by Todd, Drake and I got only 3 turns until Lich\u2019s done for. Drake\u2019s cyborg is luckily immune to the song due to being a bot.\n\n\nDrake attempts to destroy some of the tentacles and punch Todd\u2019s alien in the face, but again... misses somehow and the broken tentacles just immediately reform.\n\n\nOne thing that I didn\u2019t mention, is that establishing a psychic link means that all psychic interactions take place in PM. There, we try to form a plan that actually works.\n\n\nDrake suggests to punch the alien even harder and quicker, in hopes that it\u2019ll hit in one of the two remaining rounds. Not ever gonna happen of course, Todd doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to lose his unwilling waifu.\n\n\nBut! I then tell him of a secret weapon Lich has on her, also noted in her wiki, that one wouldn\u2019t be in the know of unless if they were told about it or got hit by it...\n\n\n**[TO BE CONTINUED DUE TO WORD LIMIT AND READING COMFORT]**",
