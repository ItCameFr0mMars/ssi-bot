Today I\u2019m looking for some advice! \n\nI\u2019ve been RPing for years and I\u2019ve never grew tired of any of the RP\u2019s I\u2019ve done in a longterm basis ... except one. \n\nAt the start, it was all well. Worldbuilding was great apart from a few problems that I called my partner out for but this person agreed to change and all was going well. \n\nThe story was interesting and everything was perfect. But over time... it got boring. I cant explain exactly what happened. It feels like I\u2019m dragging the story even though I know that my partner also does his/hers part. \n\nTo cut short: i unfortunately lost interest in the RP and feel so bad about it because we\u2019re considerately deep into the story. I\u2019ve tried many times to continue but I don\u2019t have that drive anymore. \n\nSo today I\u2019m asking for advice: how do I end this RP without being rude? (I know I will hurt my partner\u2019s feelings either way.. that\u2019s inevitable).",

            "selftext": "Greetings all, in this post I am asking for your thoughts over an RP situation me and my partner cannot truly see the meaning of:  \nThis happens in a fantasy roleplay based on a gap between middle ages and the golden Roman era, an idea that came from me and my friend Dog (I will have to make some made up names for characters and players but, yes, you guessed it those who remember. Dog of my very first post: to those who want to know the full story and what we went through together, [here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i9q3c0/how_parasites_can_infect_your_server_and_your_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to the most insane story I have been involved in).  \n\nThe idea was that the ship broken down by some guys who made a character of his die  (I will call him Augus) while he was out from the roleplay for medical reasons and so we wanted to recreate a server where our character were once again together. In this new server Augus was a king of some sort of recreation of the Roman Republic, while my character (I'll call her Nova) was a woman that came from another land. Their backstory said that they met and fell in love, and Nova consequently was meant to be the next queen as soon as the politicians would have approved the marriage between the two. It was fine by me, after all it was some sort of drama I would have enjoyed to play. \n\nFast forward a year in the server, the two are still not married (fine by me), and a couple of land leaders players left, leaving a server who was supposed to be formed by four nations in two, one that is mine but not related to this story and Dog's.   \nThis wasn't actually a problem to me and the few members who stayed, but it soon turned out to be one: Dog's events became mostly focused into bashing Augus' territory, causing in my opinion the server to go in an over-burn status as there was no peace in Augus' lands, only constant  issues blowing up any second.   \nNow I think I understand that Dog didn't want the quietness to make the few players we have in the server to leave, but even too much I guess it caused people to stop relations with others apart from their party members.\n\nAnd that is where the problem comes up: Nova, this promised queen, is an altruist and she is fully committed to help others with her very hands. So it happened that in certain situations, she left the palace to aid actually people or solve issues herself as she is not the \"damsel in distress\" type, despite many times she was forbidden from assist meetings or forward suggestions due to the bureaucracy of the republic. While Augus apparently stayed home without roleplaying or was AFK. I think Nova and Augus spoke and spent some time together anyway, but I couldn't help to notice that Augus was being very cold with her.\n\nJust recently, Augus took Nova to one side and told her that he needs some time off from their relationship, and Nova gave her this time, after all being a full time leader on a constant troubled land is stressful and she told him just not to over strain himself.   \nSince she got in danger lately (she was kidnapped) and that made Augus worried, she also promised him she would have stayed at the palace until he came back.  \nWhile doing so, the Dog DMd me and told me that he felt like his characters were just a tool and no one cared about them, as if they were just quest givers and no one ever spent time with them.   \nI replied to him apologizing and telling him what I told you already: too many events divided players and caused everyone to scatter in different directions without have time to chat normally or speak with different people, perhaps a peaceful event or clearing out some old ones would have finally gave all the characters some well-deserved Rest&amp;Recuperation  \nI wasn't however aware of the turn of events that shortly came after this.\n\nA new character, coming from an ex friend who left the server a while ago after discussions and bad blood, the Wolf, which I now have heavy mixed feelings about, came up close to Augus, that was sitting outside the palace, and started to talk with him.   \nAugus was very eager to speak with this character (I can understand his feeling as he was sad) but nevertheless this person was a stranger\u2026 And they spoke of quite secret things of the state. An NPC that passed nearby, smelled (literally as it is half animal) something off from this new character (because she is an external from the republic and works with an enemy of the state that lives in the forest) and tried to drive him out from the situation before he spilled all the beans, but Augus decided not to listen. Instead he went off on a quest with this person, while Nova is in the palace.\n\nAs soon as they went off on this quest, this new character started to flirt with Augus, and he didn't say anything to stop her from doing that.   \nInstead he keeps confiding and loving her sweet words, which are basically what Nova always told him already in the past; To add insult to injury, he also stated that no one else cares about him apart from a character of his and one that is already dead. Dog basically said in character that no other player cares about Augus which is false as me and my role partner care greatly of him, but he just is always off and cold with our characters.  \nAlso Dog is completely convinced that the Wolf's character opinions are brand new (he told me in Dms) while it is just a remix of Nova's words, and now they are just being lovey-dovey in a forest, while Nova is sitting in the palace despite she wants to go out helping others but not doing that because she fears Augus may be worried if she goes off once again without telling him. \n\nI cannot hide this situation bugs me greatly as I feel offended as my character is getting basically cheated on and I am told I do not care about characters while I do care about them more than anyone else.\n\nI confronted myself with my role partner, but I couldn't come up with a solution yet, apart come here and ask you guys and gals:  \nIt goes without doubts that after all we went through, I cannot simply leave the RP. I need to talk with him and fix this issue. \n\nI am the first to admit I am not a saint, I surely have caused him some kind of pain to say these things, however, what should be the best approach to talk with him? What arguments should I use in your opinion? I rely on you fellow advisors.  \nI am deeply sorry for the extremely long posts, I apologize any difficulty of reading I may have caused, and I thank you already if you took time to read all this and if you will ever give me advice. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "I think I need to rant again.  \n\n\nWhat's up peeps? Been having a really hard time with this specific kinda thing lately with some people I've tried to rp with. Does anyone else have problems with people being like... overly picky with the rp? Like I get being picky and wanting to find the perfect partner to match your needs- but like... that's not the problem here.   \n\n\nI recently had a run-in with a roleplayer that kinda like- stuck with me, and not in a great way either, I have to admit. They seemed to be fine- they messaged me they wanted to rp with me, after seeing one of my posts- which is great, and we got to discussing and all.  \n\n\nI don't mind my partners picking plots- either from their list, or my own. I'm flexible with plots, and I'm flexible with ideas- I have my own ideas for rps that are always flexible and can be changed- this person just slid right in, gave me their plots (which were romantic/gang related plots, which I said I didn't really do... but of course, I am open to suggestions for the plots seemed somewhat interesting), and said \"choose from these\". They didn't really ask me about the plots I mentioned I had or what I was looking for, so I picked the most doable one for me and the one I could fit my characters in the best. It was fine.  \n\n\nBut then, It got worst? Idk what happened. But I said I had an idea for the character I'd like to use, and started writing out his information. I... was nervous to kinda write my character's info out, because this person seemed to be the kind of person to be like, idk, judgmental? Whenever I spoke about the rp with them, and about the character I said I might use, they would respond like this (I can't retrieve the exact messages because we kinda stopped talking to each other after I said I was kinda fed up with the situation, but it went like this or was similar to this):  \n\n\n&gt;\"Can you make your character have long, blond hair, I find that really hot.\"  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Can your character be the rough, bad boy kind? Maybe be mean, cold... (etc.),\"  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You have to have your character be really attractive. He *has* to be hot. I *want* him to be hot.\"  \n\n\nAnd more- Of course, I'm a people pleaser, so I told them \"okay, sure, the character I had in mind is kind of mean and nasty already... he has longer hair but it's not blonde, and I *think* he's attractive?\"  \n\n\nOf course, they didn't let me show the character to them- like, I had to write a description because I draw all my characters, and drawings aren't \"realistic\" enough for them to be attracted to or something. **(Note: I mentioned I drew my characters in the post they responded to, and asked for people to be okay with it. I pointed this out to them, and they responded with \"Well... It's just not realistic, and I can't get an idea, I'm picky\")**  \n\n\nThey seemed to be eh about it, but they let me send my character info over, basic info, a description, and I reworked him a bit to fit the plot they sent and all. But of course... like I predicted, they were going to be picky/judgmental about it.  \n\n\nMy character was written the way he was- The only things I changed was a bit of backstory to fit the plot and I thought I was good. But no, I guess he wasn't what they \"envisioned\" or \"were attracted to\", so they continued to dictate based off of *their preferences, and their preferences only*  \n\n\n&gt;\"Why is he not above 6'0? I am personally 5'6, and short guys are... ya know, I don't want to be with anyone under 6'0.\"  \n\n\nI- okay? I mean... 1) I guess height is not a big deal in general, but it really just became a big deal to you? And 2) I'm a short guy, I guess she was implying they were gross or something, but even I was like \"uh- okay- I guess-\" 3) Why are you like- talking in first person? Why do YOU, yourSELF not want to be with anyone under 6'0? Why are you speaking like you're your character?   \n\n\nMaybe I can get over height, maybe I would've changed him and made him taller, idc- but it got worst.  \n\n\nNow, My character is an intersex person- but he obviously identifies as male, therefore he is a man. Easy, right? Not to this person!  \n\n\n&gt;\"What is intersex?\"\n\nI explain it to them, not thinking much about it, just informing them what it is. Nothing wrong with that, I get this a lot whenever I decide to use this specific character- I ain't gonna be mad about that kinda stuff, I'll explain it so you know.  \n\n\n&gt;\"Ohh, no, I don't like that. I want to rp with a REAL man. Not a *hybrid.* The plot I have given you requires the character to be a *real* man.\"\n\nI- a real man? Okay, so my character who isn't a cisgender man isn't accepted to you? You literally said you'd prefer to rp with a male character, I gave you a male character- I told them I don't mind changing the height, maybe, but I told them I don't want to change my whole entire character's gender. I get having preferences, but the way they went about it seemed like- He wasn't a \"real\" man, or almost calling him something similar to an animal because they used the word \"hybrid\" a few times- that was the main problem. I just said hey, look, I don't want to change my characters whole entire gender because that's something that would change my character as a person. That's like taking a book and tearing out a hundred pages, and still expecting to be able to read it and understand what's going on later on in the story.   \n\n\nBut still, they went on  \n\n\n&gt;\"But that isn't what is expected. I want to rp with a character that is a real man. My plot requires a character that is a real man, I only am attracted to real men. If you wanted to rp with a character who wasn't actually a man, why would you not put it in your post?\"\n\n1) still, implying that a non-cis man is not a real man. Whether they are trans, intersex, etc.- none of them would be considered a real man to them. 2) They started talking in first person again, demanding what they wanted and only their own preferences, not asking my own at all and not respecting what I told them even when I expressed my preferences to them, and 3) I didn't think to \"put it in my post\" (which they only read because I called them out for not reading it, I swear) because a) my character is still a guy, no matter what you think, why would I have to say that I have a character who is intersex? He's a guy- it shouldn't make any difference in a plot other then has affect on his backstory- that's that and b) I didn't even talk about my character's genders because I didn't even want to do a romantic rp in the first place! Like why would it matter? I literally made an exception because you wanted to do it and I liked the plot. Besides, this person is like the only person who's actually had such an intense issue with it in the first place.  \n\n\nI expressed my feelings to them, once again, saying that I'm sorry I didn't \"put it in my post\", but my character was still a guy despite what they said.   \n\n\n&gt;\"I don't mind feminine guys. I don't mind a feminine face or features. But that's not a guy.\"\n\nDammit. And then they went on to other really oddly specific and dumb shit.  \n\n\n&gt;\"Why would he wear fake nails/paint his nails, I'm a girl and I don't even do that. That's weird. I don't like that.\"\n\nOkay and? Like bruh, just because you don't like that doesn't mean I can't write my character having certain features. Like uh he's my character, if I like to write him that way, then I will- he's not your character-  \n\n\nAnd then... there excuse for it all was:  \n\n\n&gt;\"I told you, I am picky.\"\n\nOf course you are. But there's a difference between being \"picky\", I'd consider myself to be slightly picky with rp partners too, and \"I want to literally decide everything\". Like bruh, rping is supposed to be the ideas of 2 or more people written out collaboratively, not you saying \"do this, do that, I don't like this, I hate that\". Like, go write a book if that's the case? Literally, why bring another person into it if you have the whole entire story and characters figured out in the first place. There's no creativity at all, just what YOU want- why bother?  \n\n\nAnd what get's me the most is that they responded to *my* ad, and expected to get their demands. Like literally, I post my ads to find people who are okay with my preferences, and have similar preferences and ideas to me, so we can get along well and have a fun time. If you were going to be so strict or demanding- no, I'm sorry, \"picky\"- why don't you post your own ad? Put your own ideas and preferences in it-? Why come to my ad that contains preferences that literally aren't anything similar to your own, ignore them, and get to this stage of discussing an rp with me? It's such a waste of time, and it's not fun at all, not one bit.  \n\n\nRping is not only there to give YOU a break from YOUR reality, or live out YOUR fantasies only- rping is there to do that for all the parties involved.  \n\n\n I don't want to change my characters who I'm happy with and have had around and been developing for years just because they don't get you off or something. I find them great the way they are, and I'm sorry that you can't see that, but you shouldn't be able to dictate and change my character all because you don't have a preference for them. Especially expecting me to do so after coming to my ad and asking me to rp based off my ad. It's like, annoying, and low-key you take offense to it because they make you feel like you or your characters aren't good enough because they don't like them or aren't attracted to them.   \n\n\nOnce again, be picky! Find that right person for you! But don't dictate every single part of the rp to be based on your own preference. Post an ad of your own, write a book, do something like that- don't come to me who obviously has different preferences to your own and ask me to do your preferences only.  \n\n\nOf course, I told them I wasn't comfortable rping with them, because I didn't like not only how they were controlling, but also how they spoke of non-cis-guys as well (\"Not real men\"), and we parted.  \n\n\nBasically, it's annoying. Don't control other people, don't control how they want to rp their characters, or how those characters are written, and don't come to people's ads asking to rp if you are going to just do what you want to do and not listen to the other person. It's a shame too, I actually thought their idea wasn't bad- maybe I can take it and rework it into my own sort of idea, huh?  \n\n\nHope you all have a good rest of your days- I'd love to talk to ya'll to see if you have similar problems, and hear your stories as well- of course, any kind of conversations are welcome! I sure hope I ain't the only one that has experienced something like this, and am not the only one that thinks this kinda stuff is crazy.  \n\n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "To get it out the way, I have a tendency to join RP groups more than 1v1 RPs. I have nothing against 1v1, I just like meeting a lot of people at once and looking for a vibe before we get to personal plotting.\n\nI joined this group, not because I was actually looking for a group at the time, but because I was in the owner's fandom content related server and they wanted to make an RP group and a lot of the members agreed and I just went with it because why not. I had an inkling it wasn't gonna be the most literate group, so I braced myself for all the one liners and bad grammar and just wanted to vibe.\n\nI should have left.\n\nMost of them literally act like they can't separate the characters from themselves and the admins literally had to keep telling them to stop writing their sheets in 1st POV. Not the worst part, but it can be irritating to RP with a bunch of self-inserts that love to give themselves a lot of power.\n\nI brought up a legitimate concern in the server about the power structure. I know most canon stuff can get tweaked for the environment and I get that, but they literally went so far. For example: teleporting. For the record, this is a Riordan verse RP server, to help with context. For those that don't know who he is, he wrote a bunch of children to YA books about demigods and mythology and whatnot. The most famous of his works are for Percy Jackson and the Olympians and it's continuation Heroes of Olympus.\n\nANYWAY\n\nThe teleportation for the canon is very exhaustive. A canon character literally almost faded out of EXISTENCE from excessive use. \n\nBut what do these people do? They are teleporting all over the place, more than they even walk. They would teleport to a location that's just 10-20 feet away and inside of people's cabins without even trying the door. \n\nI simply pointed out they shouldn't be using it for every movement from location to location because it is very much unrealistic and they were like 'well, the admins let them have that power so they can do whatever they want with it'. Even the admins were okay with it and I'm just at a loss.\n\nAnother incident was, as I pointed out earlier, they can't separate themselves from their characters. Like at all.\n\nMy issue? There was a scene where my character's half brother (they aren't that close but they stay in the same cabin) was upset because he got into a fight with his girlfriend. I didn't read their fight because stalking other people's threads that I'm not involved in is hella weird, even though most of them do it. Anyway, supposedly during the fight, in her anger, the girlfriend told him that she needed \"to find someone that actually wants to take me out and show me off like I'm the best thing ever\" and then he left and her friend came by later yelling and trying to convince him that he knows how she gets when she's angry.\n\nMy character spoke up, because she was there the whole time and basically said that the girlfriend said something hurtful to him and the fact that she still expected him to come back sounded a bit abusive. That was her point of view on the situation, given the context that SHE was given.\n\nBasically, the person who played the girlfriend didn't like that and went to the admins I guess. And now I got reported for 'bullying' her and I'm expected to apologize.\n\nI'm not gonna apologize. I ignored the pings and went on about my business. It's not my fault they want to have a soap opera level drama every day and act like it's real life. I'm not gonna come out on the main and apologize because my CHARACTER feels that her CHARACTER was a bit abusive to her boyfriend. I'm not going to pretend to be apologetic because that want to drag something my character said out into OOC drama. \n\nIf I get kicked then oh fucking well, but that's not my issue and I won't feel any love lost from them.\n\nHonestly, this server has a bunch of other issues but I'd need to write a whole short story to get into it all.",

This is just hilarious.  \nOn discord, I was chatting with a username about an rp. We intended to do high fantasy, but my character was going to be an elf. We plotted out the story and they ask if they can play a 'monstrous' character. I ask how monstrous we're talking. They say satyr which alright, that's...kinda doable. But if we wanted to play nsfw, I'm not sure I'd be okay with that. So I asked them 'so their lower half would be goat?' to get a feel for what they were looking for. They said;  \n'And their head. As monstrous and inhuman as possible.'  \n\n\n...Now, look, if you want to play a furry or a goat character or a satyr with a goat head, you do you. But we agreed to fxf, fantasy, and they made no mention of wanting to play a furry. Essentially, they just wanted a goat with human breasts, with how much of their character being goat we're talking here. So ah, yeah, no thanks. Writing nsfw with that simply isn't my style, and I don't like having that thrust upon me.  \n\n\nI told them I wouldn't want a character to be that inhuman, and they got clearly upset about it, typing 'okaaaay' and being annoyed/not responding. I'm not really going to try anymore, it doesn't seem like it'll work out. Seriously, if someone wants to play an inhuman, mostly animal character, then be upfront about it, that's all.  \n\n\nI'm not into goats, sorry not sorry.",

            "selftext": "I don't think it warrants a NSFW flair, but, for those sensitive to such content, this post is about an idea pitched to me where a major plot point was children being harmed. \n\nAs so many of these stories start, we were discussing plots and characters. We'd settled on the characters we wanted to play and a modern fantasy setting. Cool, that's what I like best, there's a lot you can do with a kitchen sink type thing. Things seem to be going well and then he pitches his idea for how our characters meet. \n\nMy character's kids would bully his character's kid! \n\n...Okay. So our characters would meet because their kids aren't getting along and your character would have a reason to dislike mine right out of the gate. I'm a little hesitant that you immediately put my character on the bad guy side of things, since their kids are being dicks to an innocent child who never did anything to them. But I can kind of see how this could be interesting. Getting off on the wrong foot and such, maybe things aren't what they seem or something. We could NPC a teacher or principle or fellow parent, could be fun to add an outside force- \n\nWait, you're deciding all on your own that my character's kids relentlessly bullied your character's kid for months? That's kinda too far for me, man, maybe we could scale that back a bit. Huh? What'd you say? Your character would mix laxatives into their child's food so their kid could bait my character's kids into stealing it and get them sent to the hospital??? And one of my character's kids nearly dies??? \n\nI asked him how exactly he thought that would develop in rp and pointed out that my character would quite literally try to murder someone who sent his kids to the hospital. And that, y'know, his character would probably be in serious trouble if anyone ever managed to prove what he did. His answer was, essentially, that my character would attack his, his would mop the floor with mine, and my character would... respect their alpha male strength and accept defeat? Apparently? \n\nI don't know how he expected this to happen, but it was clear that he expected the end result would be a ship. He talked about our characters trusting each other and mine defending his against unrelated accusations and going through major effort to understand him. Since, y'know, a parent wants to date the person whose kids were relentlessly bullying theirs for months. Or on the other side of things, a parent wants to date the person who basically poisoned their kids. Cause that's what everyone looks for in a relationship. Where the fuck do these people come from.",

            "selftext": "  \nHeyo, me again. The last awful rp experience I had was with an rper who kept telling me about being in the hospital at random times then not following up (long story) and another time I've posted here besides that was with an rper that was under 18 trying to play out nsfw with an underage character. So normally, I don't complain unless a story is seriously crazy or if it gets me truly stunned. Today I'm just sad.  \n\n\nI'm not mad at 'M'. Just sad and kinda hurt. 'M' and I have been writing an rp since september, and it quickly became both of our favorites. They drew our characters, I made them playlists- you get the idea. Our writing blended super well and I was so thrilled to have them as a partner. In late October, they had no days off for a couple weeks, then were visiting family. Life happens, they gave me a headsup, it's not the end of the world. We were sort of on break, but checked in from time to time.  \n\n\nToday was supposed to be our big day back into it. It's my day off work, it's their day off work, and we planned on marathon writing the whole afternoon and evening. We're both so excited and so close to the end, so I was stoked to do this. This morning they told me they were just going to grab breakfast, then hop right on and get writing.  \nThat was 6 hours ago.  \nI know life happens. I absolutely get it. But...this isn't the first time they've said 'will update soon!' then kinda poofed that day, either. And hey, stuff gets in the way, no biggie. It just hurts today because we've planned out for this. They said 'I'm so excited I hope to rp with you a lot'. I poked them an hour ago asking if they were still around, but nothing. I'd say maybe a genuine emergency came up, but I saw them sign on when I poked them, so I dunno? I certainly hope they're okay and it's no emergency, I just really wish they told me if they changed plans instead.  \n\n\nMaybe I sound like a crazy clingy partner. I hope not. I would never ask someone for their entire day, we both \\*wanted\\* to do this. I'm just hurt and sad. I miss our story. I was so excited, too. I really needed a fun afternoon.",

They tell me something that is pretty obviously a joke about our characters (like, so obvious that I would have to be an idiot to not get it). So of course, I reply with another obvious joke. And nearly every fucking time, they don't get it and reply something like 'Uh, I wasn't serious, you know?' \n\nI am currently writing with someone, and every joke of mine flies over his head. Even if it is something super obvious like 'if (your character) is so sweet, (my character) might want to eat them.' they will just reply something like 'Uhm, wasn't it obvious that I was refering to his personality?'\n\nIt is not my problem that they don't find my jokes funny, don't get me wrong. But the total lack of understanding on their part when it comes any humour while claiming that they are super humorous never fails to surprise me. And it is not just me, in group rps I encounter this type as well, and they never get the joke with other people either. \n\nThe worst part is when you want to start some nice banter, and they seem to be genuinely shocked that you didn't get their joke, when it is really them who does not understand that my reply was meant to be funny. I often wonder if they talk to others about me claiming that I am one of the people who takes their jokes too seriously...",

At least, that's what I assumed we would be doing. We began plotting and discussing a little about what we would like to explore, how mental illnesses are often portrayed incorrectly or disrespectfully, we were on the same page and I was actually looking forward to starting something.\n\nThe problem began when I started to present options for characters that I would like to play. The weird thing is that this person was discussing everything from a first-person perspective, so basically whereas I am discussing my character from that character's perspective, i.e \"sally is this type of a character, this is what she would do\", they kept saying \"well, i don't know how i would handle that, i'm the type of person that would do x\". Attached in here is an example of our conversation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i33bk1cee8y51.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc721b3ce1281fe29c66ad868563da1419d7f46c\n\nI am blue, they are purple. I gave them examples of characters I can pull out for this roleplay, and they presented me with this. After this, they said: \"oh, sorry, I think I'm projecting a bit too much of myself. and also I'd rather if you picked a woman, if that's okay\", to which I said alright, I can do that. I then asked them to clarify if they will be playing a character or themselves, because I was under the impression that they'd be playing a character, and they said they'll be playing a character. I asked them to tell me about their character because it will make it easier for me to decide on who I wish to play, and since then they haven't said anything. I am so confused at this point.",

We got on voice chat a few times, this was not an edgy 12 year old. He sounded like he could be double my age (I\u2019m 19). Meanwhile, I was DMing the mod and telling him everything. The mod just wanted to move forward and ignore it. Eventually, the player told me to forget he ever mentioned murder and deleted his entire rant so I couldn\u2019t screenshot it. I played nice in case he was being serious, but he keeps DMing me with these new RP servers that he starts because he keeps getting kicked out of servers, only for them to inevitably die.

This is a continuation of [https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/jqaih7/nsfw_how_i_beat_a_perverted_powergamer_with_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf](Part 1) due to the word limit and reading comfort. I suggest you read set previous part so you won\u2019t be confused reading this one. Thanks!)*\n\n\n**PREVIOUSLY ON A R/BADRPERSTORIES BLOG:**\n\n\n*Drake meanwhile tries to beat up Todd\u2019s OC, using a flurry of aimed powerful punches augmented with Blue and Green Artron radiation to make them go faster and hit harder... but they all miss?!*\n\n\n*This is getting ridiculous...*\n\n\n*Suffice to say though that the stakes of this battle have dramatically raised... *for the worse, in my case.*\n\n\n*\u201dBut! I then tell him of a secret weapon Lich has on her, also noted in her wiki, that one wouldn\u2019t be in the know of unless if they were told about it or got hit by it...\u201d*\n\n\n**AND NOW, BACK TO RUNNING FROM PLANTS!**\n\n\nA girl\u2019s greatest cunning weapon... one that easily dives under the radar of many others...\n\n\n**... women\u2019s cosmetics.**\n\n\nSpecifically, the poisonous type.\n\n\nIt was a joke detail addition to Lich\u2019s sub-weapons arsenal that I gave her, inspired from a *Doctor Who* character called River Song who used a similar lipstick poison to try and kill the main character of the show in an adventure once.\n\n\nA really nice femme fatale weapon that\u2019s lately seen the end of it\u2019s days.\n\n\nLich was actually wearing the poisonous lipstick and nailpolish at the time (under several layers of self-protective cosmetics and taking a lasting antidote herself of course because you don\u2019t want to *poison yourself*), a detail I had announced many actions ago under everything she had equipped at the moment. The poison\u2014originally created by my good Slav friend who was ecstatic at seeing it described as one of her weapons\u2014was said to easily overdose someone with a small amount of it, paralyze them, temporarily shut down all their supernatural abilities, and knock them out in less than a minute. Sometimes memory loss applies as well.\n\n\nCures aren\u2019t all that common on the planet, Lich\u2019s civilization had a monopoly on it. It\u2019s colourless, tasteless, odorless, and could be mixed in with other things such as beverages or cosmetics.\n\n\n*Meaning a single kiss could possibly stun and weaken the plant Xeno enough for a surprise of a lifetime.*\n\n\nAmazing that a *joke weapon* of all things is going to save the day. [XD]\n\n\n*Time for a plan:*\n\n\nStep 1: Get Lich to be as un-hypnotized as possible, she can snap out of it herself in the background thanks to psychic resistances, fitting some sort of physical trauma to it, and Drake\u2019s OC reversing the song and sending it back over the psychic link. Gotta play by the rules to get somewhere legally unlike Todd\u2019s continuous cheating, so to not have my actions retconned later on for BSing.\n\n\nStep 2: Convince the OOC Todd that Lich is still under his melodic spell so that he stops his OC from playing it, and think that I\u2019m on his side rather than that of Drake\u2019s. This is to close the distance between Lich and Todd\u2019s OC to the point of him being unable to dodge, run or even just simply see what\u2019s hit him. Preferably, I\u2019d have them glued together for **absolute** accuracy.\n\n\nStep 3a: Use the real superpower of suggestion and in-character charm to get Todd to have his OC kiss Lich in the Public RP Chats. I say Public RP Chats, because PM Lemon RP is a death sentence and nobody is ever going to believe me that I won if I even could in Todd\u2019s creepy fetish world.\n\n\nStep 3b: ... make a badly-aged drawing of *the kiss of death* with Lich and the plant Exo in student form that hasn\u2019t happened yet as a bargaining chip if he doubts you.\n\n\nObviously, it\u2019s truly the best plan I\u2019ve ever come up with so far.\n\n\n*Resume the battle!*\n\n\nI have Lich first attempt to use her sonic rapier\u2019s tiny-but-powerful computer to calculate, predict and play back the melody it receives but flip the polarity of the soundwave, as to cancel it out and partially fulfill step 1 whilst trying to record it for maybe later.\n\n\nSomehow, that don\u2019t work according to Todd. He says that it causes the melody to blast her even harder, even though that wouldn\u2019t happen. Just look at those sound-proof earbuds and headphones utilizing that tech.\n\n\n*But ey, not like it was vital to step 1* due to Drake\u2019s OC being a-ok anyway.\n\n\nLich pulls a quick one thanks to her time perception ability, purposely wrecking the sonic feature of her weapon before being bit by the motherload of edgy love poetry. A loud and painfully high sound was emitted from it, partially messing up her remembered melody because of it. The sound shatters several street lamps before it resonates and dissolves into the Market\u2019s alleyways.\n\n\nAnd the physical destruction of the sonic feature painfully burning Lich\u2019s hand, easily becoming a 2nd degree burn wound.\n\n\nShe falls on her knees, twitching and shaking whilst she grasps her head. Her quickening breathes becomes warmer, and her two slow hearts begin to beat quicker and quicker...\n\n\nAs Drake goes to attempt and take the overwhelmed Lich to safety, Todd immediately has all of his OC\u2019s plant-like tentacles jump at Lich and entangle her from head to toe, prepared to leg it with his \u201cvictim\u201d of the night.\n\n\nNoticing that Todd thinks he\u2019s won the fight, I spur Drake on in PM to not give up chasing him as we might need to include his OC\u2019s opposing acting skills into the plan to fully get Todd\u2019s guard down at all costs.\n\n\nHe tries to make an effort to get Lich freed by slashing, tearing and sending volleys of energy blasts at the tentacles, but nothing yet again lands or even causes any inconvenient damage. Of course, he doesn\u2019t let her go.\n\n\nTodd wants to call it a day as well, but I tell him that I\u2019m not done yet and he should really analyze Lich\u2019s next action so to... \u201cspice up the beating that\u2019ll follow.\u201d\n\n\nLich\u2014battling her hypnosis with Drake\u2019s psychic help\u2014does know that the power of suggestion doesn\u2019t need to be a magical one to be convincing. Abusing the controlled uncanny lovesick side she got given by Todd, Lich slowly starts to pseudo-suck-up to Todd\u2019s OC with words and body language you would *never* see her do were it not for the *very lemon* nature of this cursed RP.\n\n\nSince I can\u2019t have her exercise a proper action due to those stupidly armoured plant tentacles, I bet all my money on writing the most useless yet useful narrated dialogue going something among the lines of:\n\n\n&gt; *Quietly squirming of the way [Xeno-plant] constricted her in his slimy embrace, her womanly assets were already quite restraint within her loose blouse by her tightly-buttoned black gilet. Like a corset, already caging her sleek curves throughout a tiresome day of hard work and immense external pressure.*\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cP...please, young Mr. [stutters false student last name]~ I... I haven\u2019t got the freedom t-to reposition my arms and legs..! Ah~..! Y... you see, y-you have me bound in a most... unmannered way~ P-please, don\u2019t tighten me so much whenever you shift your balance~..!*\n\n\n&gt; *The lady\u2019s face was coloured a deep and vivid rouge, almost as red as her parted lips passed by various breaths. Was it of her being scared for her life for the first time in decades? Was it due to being constricted, like an anaconda does to suffocate and break their prey? Or, was it because of her embarrassment at the sight of the other individuals\u2019 eyes..? Focussed on her tied-up body in distress, one that now yearns to not be saved by her trusted co-worker? To add her captivity to the list by her alien captor\u2014 ... no, her own human pupil she swore to protect from evil and impurity, one who previously bore such stunning features and soft lips to deeply taste and passionately kiss\u2014The need for her to unwind in private and indulge herself in her newfound, unprofessional fantasies was weighing heavily on her mind. To be entangled between the arms and legs of a warm yet coarse-moving minor who still lacks countless years of experience, unlike her. Someone who hasn\u2019t yet truly perfected their rough advances on such a proper\u2014yet deeply mentally tainted\u2014lady, of high social status and class; a daily routine just waiting to be scheduled in a blank hour near the end of the day. Hiding in plain sight as but a private tutoring session for a very... \u201cdifferent\u201d, kind of lesson.*\n\n\n&gt; *It all felt to her like... bordering on the edge of a safe pure Heavenly life, and the merciless and everlasting anguish of Hell. Dangerous and disgraceful, were she to fall into his eyes and plummet again and again into the confines of his warm and loving embrace, trying to climb out of the thoughts that wouldn\u2019t leave her every drop of blood thoroughly pumped by her two maddening hearts.*\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cHah~! \u2014 W... wouldn\u2019t it b-be better if you\u2019d\u2014 ... if you\u2019d just dispose of this tin mutt..? I... I\u2019d wish for you to hold me... ravish my lips with yours... a student affair with that of your teacher on the s-streets... fares better without some jealous t-tattletale, six feet under... don\u2019t you say~? Dancing with me... above his lifeless, reinforced shell, in whatever way or pace you want to tire me out with~...?\n\n\n&gt; *Like a golden apple hanging barely out of reach, just begging to be slowly bitten into and savour it\u2019s forbidden but juicy secretions for as long as she can stomach them, and keep the everlasting taste of it flavour spread out all over her tongue~ The lady couldn\u2019t stop fantasizing all about it.*\n\n\n*(oh the cringe...)*\n\n\nAnd if such an unnecessary description in an RP action where I can\u2019t get a single attack in doesn\u2019t get some lonely teen\u2019s blood even just slightly rushing, then I honestly dunno what will...\n\n\n**[TO BE CONTINUED DUE TO WORD LIMIT YET AGAIN AND READING COMFORT]**",

            "selftext": "Okay, to start off, this is all taking place on ESO. Ngl, I feel a little ashamed saying that. Anyways, I join an Imperial guild. Those guilds have a infamous reputation for being shit. This was not an exception to that rumor. \n\nI wanted to believe it would get better. However, I'm only growing to loathe it more. The creator themselves is annoying, intrusive, and controlling. While his second-in-command keeps trying to force a relationship between our characters.\n\nMy character is meant to be an former Altmer pirate that's a fugitive in the Dominion. This faction was meant to be something that shaped her into a much more mature and disciplined person. We have a Discord and often talk about our characters. The second-in-command has made comments multiple times about how he'd fuck my character. One time he said he didn't like Altmer when discussing his preferences in the general chat (I'm not involved in this conversation). I pop into the chat to reply to something else that is going on. He feels the need to then specify that my character is the exception to his preference. I don't acknowledge any comments he makes, but he persists, as they always do. His character is my character's direct superior (the ranks are shit anyway, but) so it's really fucking annoying to be hit on. When she tried to complain about something, he purposely tries to turn it into a 'date'. With us OOC playing ESO. Not to mention he also purposely will create scenarios where we are alone. I feel like it's done in hopes one day I'll have a change of heart and want to fuck. Sadly, never. I also have a S/O and am not often looking for romantic rp. I don't mind it at all, but am extremely discouraged when it feels like someone just wants to act out their fantasy. It feels really fucking weird if there's not a clear character/player divide. He also has a S/O. Frankly, he gives me the vibe of a fucking cheater, but hey. That's just me.\n\nMeanwhile, the guild is a shit show. They don't know how to run it. They listen to some of my suggestions yet still fuck it up. Everything is poorly thought out and badly organized. The owner claims to have ran a popular guild in the early 2010s, but it doesn't show. At this point I'm just planning on ghosting. I'm hesitant to outright leave because the guild is small enough it'll create a direct confrontation. \n\nTL;DR\nCreepy men won't stop trying to fuck my character. Oh yeah, they don't know how to run a group either.",

I get that there's a tossup in demographics, yeah. For example, a lot of roleplayers on Reddit are cis and heterosexual, a lot of roleplayers on Tumblr or Twitter are not cis nor heterosexual, and there's a middleground on more niche sites and forums.\n\nDo you guys notice this? If you do, and you're like me in the sense that you're only really comfortable with a handful of pairings, does it frustrate you?",

            "selftext": "Do y\u2019all ever encounter a partner that you really don\u2019t mesh with OOC wise? I\u2019ve currently got this problem. A partner added me on Discord. We began an RP. And now we have the most boring, shitty OOC chat imaginable and it makes me want to tear my hair out every time I see my Discord messages light up with a message from them. \n\nHere is an example conversation:\n\n&gt;Them: (Describes one of the many bad things that has befallen them)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Oof  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Are you from Minnesota?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Not anywhere close I\u2019m afraid  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Please don\u2019t use that phrase then. It\u2019s a Minnesota thing. And too many people use it. It\u2019s... a trigger now\n\nSo, that happened. It blew my mind because I\u2019ve never heard anything say that an expression can only be used by residents of a certain state, or that something as common as \u2018oof\u2019 was one of them, but I let it go even though it was weird as hell.\n\nThis was our chat from last evening. \n\n&gt;Them: Buddy?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Sup  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Not a lot, really...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I\u2019m currently obsessed with this silly cat video (link)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Uh... Alright  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: It\u2019s very cute  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them, 15 minutes later: Blargh\n\nThat was the *entire conversation*. \n\nIt\u2019s just like\u2026 I\u2019ve never met anyone as difficult to talk to as this person. If they\u2019re not telling me about their various medical issues, we\u2019re having a conversation without any charisma at all and I have to wonder what other common phrases might actually be Minnesotan that would piss them off. Although, as far as I\u2019ve seen they lack the ability to express any emotion so intense that they could be described as \u2018pissed off\u2019. \n\nEven when we were plotting the RP I didn\u2019t detect any excitement about *anything* having to do with it. And when the initial RP fell through for various reasons and I *tried* to get out and say that maybe we shouldn\u2019t RP together, they got all sad because they wanted to write and so I felt bad, so we plotted a new one to start, and here I am. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this sort of thing? The RP itself is fine, but in my ads I always make it clear that I love to chat OOC. I like discussing things and getting excited about them, but every time I speak with this person it\u2019s the conversational equivalent of eating a piece of plain boiled chicken with saltine cracker garnish, and I am uncertain about how exactly to cope with it. I've never met someone who sounded so uninterested. \n\nUgh. Or maybe, more accurately, *Blargh*.",

            "selftext": "So I was rpying with someone who I actually did like. We talked a lot, made jokes, and seemed to get along alright. There was some things I probably should have seen as red flags potentially? I hate to make it sound like they were in the wrong because I don't view them as a bad person or anything of that sort if I am being honest. Just what happened kind of bothered me and I am trying to ignore it. I am writing this and wondering if I sort of jumped the gun, but I get a bad feeling about it all. Therefore, I listened to my gut.\n\nAnyway, in general we did not rp long. However when we went at a very fast pace. I knew they were someone who was into romance in rp. Which was not a problem with me, but it is hard to generally make the entire plot about the romantic aspect as it seems like things get stale? I was trying really hard to make a story, and do romance. I just was hoping to put some 'flavor' in the story. I kind of got a sense that the partner was a bit bored of it. It seemed like anything else was an after thought. Characters not absorbing anything. Along with ooc I realized maybe they had no concern about my character's stories at all. I figured maybe they were just a quiet person.\n\nEventually I did end up figuring maybe if I let the pairings happen, it would not be a big deal. Possibly even make the story feel better. They seemed like they had a general interest as they were moving at a decent pace. Cut to us going in the Erp scene. Things happened, and after that they started moving slower. Seeming less interested, and in the end I noticed they just slowed down completely. I waited and thought maybe I should just give it a minute and not freak out. I ended up removing them because I was very lost and confused. I kinda felt weirdly used? It was not like I probably shouldn't have seen the potential of this happening but I admit I am sad none the less.\n\nTbh I probably could have asked them. I really just had a unfortunate feeling from the whole thing. Even now I am possibly wrong with how I felt.  Something told me it would be best to just not bother them about the whole thing, and they could possibly feel pressured if I tried to talk to them about why they slowed down.",

Im seeking some advice on how to spot Fake ERP Doms as well as things i should look out for in potential partners, Erps etc. After the whole shit-storm with a toxic rp group (One of which who has graduated from creepy douchebag to character thief) another post i made on here, i really want to get back into writing things again without anymore issues ERP especially. Smut/ERP has a really bad rap i know that for multiple reasons however im convinced there are rpers who actually are looking for the same thing: Good ERP that is managed without getting out of hand or boundaries being violated. BDSM is something im not too familiar with yet have researched a bit for prior rps. As you can see, being a newbie its easy to not understand how i can make my scenes realistic yet enjoyable for all parties involved. Another thing id like advice on is ways i can politely get my point across that i wish to keep things IC only without being a jerk. Odviously i have been learning both IC and OOC about setting strict boundaries with others im getting better at it! Anyway, is there any tips you can share with me? Thanks for your input",

            "selftext": "(On mobile)\nI cut off my nearly 5 year long rp partner because I no longer wanted to be friends with her, she gave off a lot of selfish and \u201cpity me\u201d, attention seeker vibes a lot of the time when we weren\u2019t rping. An emotional vampire I guess.\n\nShe once told me while out with her family for a weekend that they were being mean to her and that she wanted to \u201cend it so badly\u201d I asked her where she was at so I could call the police to do a wellness check and take her back to her bf\u2019s but then she flipped the switch and Changed saying she was okay and that she was just being dramatic. She even begged me to not tell her parents (she was 22 at the time btw) cause she didn\u2019t want to get in trouble. I\u2019ve told her to cut her family out of her life when she tells me she \u201chates her family\u201d. \n\nShe just seemed to always make everything about her and make it so that everything was her fault. I tried my hardest to help her but I\u2019m not a therapist and I can only do so much. She also made her side of the rps so dark, gloomy and just horrible. Having her in rp Parents hate her or be abusive, or have abusive ex-bfs, be overly Rebellious in Highschool au rps having horrible and sad backgrounds in general (we did self Insert rps with anime\u2019s we both liked)\n\nShe just seemed To always put her own horrible and bad life and real life traumas in the rps we did. I even had to confront her after a bit cause she had been putting none-consent sex in the rp (that were mostly Directed at me cause I didn\u2019t feel comfortable putting her in that situation) I\u2019ll admit I should had told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable the first time she did that but I was new to rping and I\u2019m kind of a people pleaser, plus I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around her.\n  \nNow I\u2019m not trying to sound rude here or be too judgmental but... she was way too much into the nsfw aspect of our rps. I have explained to her on some occasions that I\u2019d like more story base and limited nsfw, but she will still throw herself at the guy she wanted to be paired with, in a short amount of time. When I try to push in for more time for her and this pair she wanted to get to know one other she\u2019ll get offered and act in rp that the guy isn\u2019t interested in her and go about feeling ugly and unwanted. When she flirts or tries to get with other males in the rp (even when she is dating someone in the rp) and I make the guy turn her down she acts like a nice girl and Insults the guy that rejected her \u201cI bet you have a small dick anyways\u201d\n\neven when I try to add drama to the rp she would try to speed through it, not let the drama simmer y\u2019know? She always wanted all the male characters she was paired with to be dominant, rough and forceful (like literally force her to do things) when ever I challenged that, cause I just didn\u2019t feel like the character was like that, she would get all mad and upset in rp and go on about how the male doesn\u2019t love her and think she\u2019s weird for her kinks. \n\nAnd even after all that stuff... I still feel bad for cutting her off.. I still had some good times and fun memories. I made some of my favorite oc\u2019s when rping with her, but... I know I shouldn\u2019t go back and try to mend things. It\u2019s been a week now and I still feel the urge to ran back. I don\u2019t know why though..",
