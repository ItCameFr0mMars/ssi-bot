This girl replied, she would play Sesshomaru for me and I would be Koga for her.\n\nHer plot was her oc was sent to potentially be a bride of Koga but the marriage wouldn't go through and there'd be a time skip to where Koga and her oc would meet again and then fall in love.\n\nWell that's not the plot she acted out. her first post she sent me a giant, novel length starter. In it she took control of Koga, changed the plot to they were married and her oc was just miserable the whole time. Her oc was insane with her mood swings. She'd go from crying hysterically to laughing, to angry within seconds. Her oc was adored and loved by Koga's tribe for some reason, and she got rid of the bird demons plaguing them with smoke some how. Her oc could do nothing wrong and Koga's tribe began turning against him and threatening to kill Koga if he didn't make her oc happy.\n\nShe was basically rping with herself, she never replied to my starter for my side, she focused solely on her side and tried to send me more for her side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped the rp and demanded to know what the hell was wrong with her. She said she wanted to change the plot and for me to to along with it. I said no, she threw a fit and I had to block her.\n\nGirl was crazy, anyone else meet someone like that?",

Had their own map, custom logos, active staff members so back and so forth, it was great... for the first few minutes. \n\nSo I submit a plague doctor {Cliche, I know.} that was supposed to contribute to plot! I felt great, then I saw guilttripper throwing around insults in the chat? Yes, I wondered what happened and temporarily checked the general channel. Apparently some other people were toxic to them, I couldn't help but try to help the situation so I kept asking what was going on. \nOne of the generous people who I later became good friends with had DMed me, saying that this person was constantly like this because others did not like the fact his common mercenary woman was going to try marrying a, and I state, nobleman. \n\nNow keep in mind this roleplay was low fantasy but still had realistic elements in terms of medieval nobility and marriage arrangements, so right off the bat everyone knew they were never going to marry... but Guilttripper kept as the name implies, they kept guilt tripping others into it. Myself being the medieval nerd I was promptly stated that; \n\n'While it would be a great union and I do feel it's wholesome, either the mercenary woman would be exiled or simply the nobleman marrying her be deposed.'\n\nAnd everyone flocked behind the new guy, {Me} to try proving their argument. What happens after this?... \nI get DMed by Guilttripper calling me cruel, mean and evil for not supporting a false ideal, I kept trying to explain basic history but they kept saying, \n\"Stop talking to me.\" \n\nIt was extremely annoying, but I managed to get through it by contacting staff who kindly told him just where he can stick his logic. \n\nAnd thus I became popular around the server, and one of the people controlling the noble houses invited me to make a member under their banner. I kindly rejected due to not having an open character slot, that was right before another argument broke out with Guilttripper! Wonderful! Everyone's day gets ruined. \nWhat was it this time? They kept complaining about how they did not intend their character to be mean during an RP and retconned the entire thing without the other party's permission. They were kicked because again, I contacted staff on behalf of the other lad who was too worried of being cussed out. \n\nBefore they got kicked though, they kept bragging about ~Stealing socks from the psych ward~ \n\nAnyways, that was my short complaint..\n Look forwards to more! I've met plenty of shitty RPers.",

            "selftext": "I am among the 4 admins in an rp server that revolved around the plot and canon of this movie series, which I shall keep unnamed. This movie series is well loved, with an actor that reddit loves to gush about all the time, but the rp servers about this series are few and I don't wanna expose ourselves too much.\n\nAnyway. The story.\n\nIn our server, most of us reply in either literate or novella. We have a process wherein we ask people to submit an rp sample before joining, so that we can confirm that they fit our standards before they even start rping. This is all well and good for everyone, and it works. But apparently it doesn't work well enough.\n\nI shall name this person P. P joined the server with an rp sample that was decent in our eyes, approved by another admin who was well-versed in guns (this was to our advantage as the server was an action rp server). They were nice and all. The problem arose when they submitted an OC sheet.\n\nWe approve OC sheets before they rp, as we would like to avoid overpowered characters and don't want players to make OCs related to the protag of the movie series (because the protag of the movie is very overpowered).  P submitted a lazily made OC sheet with plot holes and inconsistencies.\n\nIt was nothing short of the edgy teen OC you might have heard before. P's OC was abandoned as a child, worked at a brothel, apparently killed a whole gang by herself at the age of 15, managed to become a ballerina and swan princess, all before 23 (her OC's supposed current age), with a cool nickname like 'the black swan' that made no sense as they never explained how they garnered this name.\n\nWe like to be moderately realistic with the rps. Killing someone at age 15? A whole gang? And they also said that apparently \"their bodies were never found again\". Rigor mortis is a thing, and it is very impossible a 15 year old girl can hide one adult body when death sets in and the body becomes twice as heavy. We mildly surprised that despite 'their' very detailed rp sample, their OC sheet was underwhelming.\n\nWe informed them of this. One of our admins tried to help her, going on two hours of convo with her on how to improve her OC. This was all for naught as soon she came back editing very little of the sheet. It was still lacking. This was when we knew that she plagiarized her reply. When the owner tried to talk to her about it, they denied and said that they were just 'not in the mood'. I won't go into a rant, but we of course refused to accept this excuse as good writing skill would show even if you were 'not in the mood'.\n\nP has blocked all of us by now. But we admins sometimes joke about it still. This incident has resulted in us requesting that newbies submit an rp sample using a custom prompt that we provide to avoid plagiarism in the future.",

            "selftext": "I'm well aware that this subreddit is primarily dedicated and used to vent out our frustrations on poor writing, mary-sues, plagiarism and overall bad role-playing experiences but I don't know where else to go or who to turn to. Normally I would speak to my friend about these things but I feel her heart would be too kind to tell me the truth. And right now I just need to be told how it is and why it is that way.\n\nOther than my friend I haven't role-played with anyone else since 2018. Of course, I've attempted to dip my toes in the water so to speak from 2018 but I haven't actually found myself role-playing with a person for more than a month. Usually the role-play ends because we don't have a lot in common, our expectations from each other were far too different to work around and some of them didn't even get past writing their first response or starter. So yeah. Other than my friend I haven't been role-playing with anyone.\n\nTo get straight to the point I'm wanting to get back out there and role-play again. The problem is I feel I have gotten too accustomed and comfortable role-playing with my friend and as of result I haven't been challenging or improving myself. Not only that but I'd like to meet new people, explore other new things with this hobby and make friends as well as improving myself as a writer and role-player.\u00a0\n\nEverybody has their own version of a good role-play partner and writer. So I'm here to ask you all what you think is a good role-play partner? What do you generally look for in your potential partners? What are your requirements? What makes them and their writing exceptional? What makes them stand out? How can you tell you've found yourself a good partner?\u00a0\n\nI'm asking because I'm so set in my ways and I feel that I need to be more considerate to the other party. Not only that but I've been role-playing with the same person for two years and I've become so comfortable with them that I've forgotten what I need to do and improve to be a good role-play partner.\u00a0\n\nYour opinions would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0",

No. Like naps? No. Wanna pick a movie? You pick. What do you like to do? Nothing. What do you enjoy doing? Nothing. Have you eaten today? No.\n\nTHAT'S BASICALLY ALL OF THE INTERACTIONS \n\nHer trying to figure out his interests and him just giving short responses that basically reflect that he likes little to nothing. The only thing she got out of him was that he likes music but the only music he likes is one rapper and no one else.\n\nI get trying to make your character seem mysterious and aloof but if you expect someone to be open to connecting with your character, at LEAST have more personality than a piece of cardboard.",

            "selftext": "I guess I'm just looking to get this off my chest. It's been about a month since I left my group, and I can't seem to find closure on the matter, so hopefully this'll help me wrap up the last four-five years of my life. This isn't a story of good or bad, really, as at one point in time I was the dick, and at one point I did my best to be the best I could. This is just the best sub I could think of to post on. I won't make much effort to be vague about names of servers, as it likely won't matter in the long run and if anyone was so inclined to go looking, these places still do exist as monuments left in time. There's no definable bad guy in this story, though if I had to name one it'd be me, most of the time\n\nFour years ago, just about, a younger me stumbled across a game named, aptly, Starbound, and it was everything I could've wanted. Coming off of Minecraft which I'd attained a few years earlier and hungry for something new, I saw something I liked- An infinite world, something familiar, yet different. There was planets forever, always different; Several races, which I drifted through during my time; and, most importantly, a blossoming community, full of people new and old and all very much in love with the game. At this point, the game was in a golden era- Which is where I found myself on a server called G, which would occupy me for a few years in which I was further driven into the fantasy due to my lackluster life in which I had little want other than to escape.\n\nG was my first introduction to RP. I remember my first day- I stumbled onto server after waiting for a spot to open in the 30 or so player limit, the hub world before the RP hub sprawling ahead of me. It was a glass platform, and ten or twenty people talking. I set up, playing a default song on my character's instrument I picked up from a chest somewhere in survival, and was quickly told to stop because I was playing over someone. I didn't understand, of course, and quickly logged off to go play something else, intimidated by how immense and strange this new place was.\n\nA few months later, maybe in the earlier part of 2015, I forget exactly how many later, I arrived back. It was still as I remembered, though the glass platform had switched to a lonesome bar on a planet made near solely of concrete. This, as I'd come to know, was actually a landing-pad for new people, which I had little idea of as in this period of time- The real hub a place known as Horsebutt, named after the in-game starsystem it was located in in-game. Back in the day before the modders had cracked the game open enough to allow automatic linking to the ship's teleporter, you had to navigate to the starsystem manually through the in-game map interface, which was a massive pain in the ass. In my first spurt back on the server, I had little idea of this as I had no idea about the forums of the server in which the coordinates to the systems were linked. I think I made my way there eventually, having entered a CRP tournament with some of the only people that'd bother to RP with someone, which at the time, had only a very minor grasp on how to write coherently. I really do appreciate them, and wish them well if they're still out there somewhere. I forgot what my IC name at the time was, so they'll just have to do a good enough job on figuring out who exactly I was if they even see this.\n\nI bailed before the tournament for whatever reason, after having some exploits on a wintery hub with a certain race of purple people that facilitated the trade of similarly colored crystals, and quit for another couple of months. My time on the game was on and off at this point, around September to November of 2015 (Can't really remember, since this was before the 1.0 update). At this point, the Outpost had been out for awhile- A lonely sort of place alluding to what they'd do later with the story. However, one modder had figured out how exactly to disable the tile protection on the Outpost, which was notable due to the ability of the server's staff now being able to modify it in the backend and apply it for a open hub that was easy to teleport to. This was great for me, as I was now able to easily navigate to the hub, and thus, RP consistently. I loved it there. Times were innocent, and I was able to find my niche among the people as a bad RPer who mainly just fucked about and fought people as a floran. I had no regard for the systems of applying for tech or what a character sheet was at the time, and as such probably ran the line on getting banned for powergaming- Thankfully, I wasn't. \n\nThen came the Cog era.\n\nAround the tail end of 2015, a certain member of the community who was staff consistently harassed the backend of the server, and did it well enough that the server was consistently down for a long period of time. It was also likely very much my fault for not checking the IP I'd put in for quite awhile, because I wasn't really able to connect until the tail end of the year. Thus began an era of strife and learning for the people of G, and with the arrival of the 1.0 Update in the first month of 2016, most everything about the game was crunched into a horrible wad of not-work. Mods that previously made up the backbone of the server were incompatible; The local chat was removed, so communicating well was near impossible until it was added back; And, most importantly, the advent of the modder.\n\nAs a sidenote, modders were incredibly useful in Starbound. Due to the game's somewhat shoddy coding and easily modifiable sprites, along with the new sign system, people could easily swap the appearance of items and recolor them basically at will. This allowed modders and builders to, essentially, make their own assets without modding the game's assets and without requiring the connecting client to download any mods. RP flourished because of this, and the modding scene was huge, for better or for worse. Eventually, mainly this year of 2020, you could just completely customize anything in the game as long as you had basic spriting skill- Online modders had taken care of the rest. Just plug and play, essentially.\n\nBack to the main point, 2016 is when I started to RP in earnest. The scene was never larger, and on G, it coalesced into a hub named Clop Clop- Horsebutt had been nuked in the transition to 1.0. Clop Clop was a hub located on a bunch of asteroids, and was pretty dull. Thankfully, a few key figures came to help it out. Mainly, a faction called Atlas- Lead by a well-liked figure that I believe was named Marcus, but I'm not sure. He disappeared early in the faction's lifetime, but for now, everyone still rallied under him, including my somewhat shitty concept of a character that young me thought was cool- A red haired merc and botanist called Sabri, who'd had his family murdered and whatnot. Obvious gamut of one's first character. He'd ended up with a character named Temperance, which was played by one of the nicest people I'd met at the time, that unfortunately dropped off the map after a few months of hanging out on-server at a separate hub called the Space Bar or some such. This was probably my favorite period of the server. It was fun and fresh, and I had people that liked me for the character and me.\n\nUnfortunately, this would not last, and we entered the Kali era.\n\nNot long after Temperance had left, I changed characters to a novakid called Honor who had a brother. This was a regrettable decision, as there was a bunch of weird stuff that happened to them. I was somewhat of an idiot at the time, and got myself into things I shouldn't have. Namely, ERP I'd rather not divulge here. But, regardless, I rejoined Atlas as this character, and didn't do a whole lot. There was a huge bar I enjoyed that wasn't on Clop Clop, and I enjoyed the people that hung around my IC, outside of the obvious above. This lasted for quite awhile, and eventually the character found themselves in a situation as a doctor fighting against a rampant disease called the Shin'kali which would turn characters into Flood/Necromorph ajacents. From here, they fought for awhile, the character had a kid, and eventually after Honor was killed during a particularly embarrassing attempt at a disguise, I left for the third time- Somewhere along this time I left to join another community called Constellations, which didn't last long. I don't really remember why, to be honest.  \n\n\nA few months to a year later I came back. At this time, discord was a thing, and I joined- As the fourm chatroom I'd used before had been disabled (I think it's prompt to know that over the course of G, they've likely gone through three fourms. Xenforo was not nice, and malware was a constant). In this period, the Shin'kali had begun to spread, likely due to a lack of any remarkable resistance once my previous character had left. This lack of resistance was due to a good bit of posturing by the leading figures to expose the race as mysterious and unbeatable IC, along with their avid resistance OOC to make sure that those who thought that it was overpowered were somewhat shot down. It was, of course, completely powerful, and from two factors factions began to raise to the server.   \n\n\nThe first was the staff of the server and their friends, which I was part of. Their discord was called Memory Lane, and was more of an echo-chamber than anything, as much as I hate to say it, as for the most part they were nice outside of a few allegations here or there.   \n\n\nThe other faction was the MS, which later went by SB, which later went by CS- And what I would eventually join. They were, likely, the villains of this era, though they were popular and seen as what was seen as anti-heroes by some as they often kept servers alive by existing in them and causing enough drama to keep people invested, if only to see them banned. By the staff, they were seen as at best to be tolerated and at worst enemies- And for good reason, as I'll explain further below.   \n\n\nI quickly made a new character named Morgan, who was a part of no faction and didn't particularly care to join any. The hub now was a city called Haven, which was colored yellow and white all over with a smattering of annoyance from everyone involved. Incredulously, I joined just a few days after the hub was created, and was thankfully able to catch the waves made by it's arrival on an otherwise slowing-down server. Atlas was still a factor here, but was mostly put to a backseat as the people that now run it were more fans of Nazism and fascism than anything- Communities dying off does tend to isolate the oddest members.   \n\n\nAnyway, the Shin'kali were still at large, and from here we move from an IC standpoint to an OOC standpoint. My character Morgan was involved with one of the staff members' characters, so I was invited to the staff discord not long after- Something that I still regret. Things were fine for awhile, and I enjoyed the server- Morgan adventuring as he did, and fighting his way through the underground of a planet called Purgatory in a psuedo-fantasy setting that lingered underneath. Really, it was cool, and I enjoyed it- But, all things must come to a close, and as Discord RP took over, the server slowed and members shed by the flock to build their own servers. I became disillusioned with this in time, but before that could happen, the most important breaking point in the history of the server occurred.  \n\n\nOne of the staff members, K, was doxxed by another member called H. H was a member of SB, and K was a member of the staff, and the fallout was huge. Several members of SB were grouped unfairly and banned along with H, and the server died  I was a member of both. I don't remember how I became involved with both, but the point stands, I was, and at this point I decided I had to choose as the sides were very much opposed- And I chose to join SB, as I saw them as the cooler of the two options. I learned to hate the staff through them, and with the influence of the server coming to a crawl, I gave my login to one of their members so the server could be griefed. This was a horrible mistake- I'd betrayed one side, and I was hated for it. I deserved whatever retribution came my way, and only recently have I reached out to reconcile.  \n\n\nThough, at this point, SB still liked Starbound, and wanted to stick around- From here, they'd found a server called Solstice or somesuch. Nothing terribly important happened here, and I don't particularly remember outside of my psion hylotl named Zealot who was a ton of fun to play. Eventually, SB was banned from this server aswell due to an argument with the owner and a stark hatred of the server's main hub. The server died not long after they left.  \n\n\nAt this point, I left SB for the first time, as I couldn't stand them bullying one of my friends in the group near consistently. Me and a few friends from the group left, and played DnD for awhile. I enjoyed this period somewhat- It was relatively recent, too, about the tail end of 2019 or so. Eventually, this fell apart, and I rejoined SB in their new server, and the main topic of this post. I'll call this server V.  \n\n\nV started out promising, and I enjoyed the luxury of being in the in-group of the server. I created a hylotl, or a fish person, named Kind, something I wanted to stick to- My character being as kind as possible. Of course, they needed money, and they mainly sold prosthetics. This is largely irrelevant, but it needs to be stated for context later.  \n\n\nThings went smoothly for awhile. Starbound had a dedicated base of people, and V was likely the last hope for any semblance of a organized body of them. The setting was the city of Halcyon, the lore of which one my friends worked very hard on. Kind, being a cybernetics dealer, fit right in and did quite a bit of business here- Even eventually opening a shop, which I was happy with. However, in the background, things weren't doing well. Another hub named Oilsight had sprung up, lead by a competing faction of members named the Aussies, who had bad blood with SB going a long ways back due to sprite-stealing and whatnot. But, regardless, the server began to break down at this point.  \n\n\nOilsight was primed to have it's first event, and had a consistent playerbase there. The hub was mainly survival based, so players would have to compete for IC resources- And the first event began. Halfway through, members of SB showed up to disrupt the procedures, some of which donned the guise of a relatively large rabbit. Of course, this didn't fly well, and with the event ruined, people began to call staff out- SB made up most of staff, and it wasn't pretty from here on. People were punished, of course, but things only got worse through the efforts of the staff who wished to push people back to Halcyon.  \n\n\nThe staff who wished to push people back formed a group called PG. This group, at least 10 strong, simply showed up on Oilsight and proceeded to steamroll anyone who wished to fight against them with superior numbers and group action. There was little anyone could do, and due to this, many left Oilsight and the server altogether, forming the beginning of the end.  \n\n\nNot long after, Halcyon returned to being the main hub, but player numbers plummeted. From here, mainly only members of staff joined the server, and those members of staff not in SB tended to leave quickly- Even those, like one of my friends who was quite important to the plot, leaving. Of course, this wasn't good for the server- But many in SB didn't care. The server stagnated, and soon it was just us- Me and the people I'd known for four years.   \n\n\nAnd then I left, too. In the midst of the Shin'kali coming back, having come to this server under the direction of the original writers, I became disillusioned with the people around me. I had gotten a job IRL not long before that I cared more about than what was going on in back-stage chat, and the banter in the discord for SB was, frankly, shocking, and I'd rather not had to stick it out for a server which had died a very long time ago. So I left, taking Kind and my contribution to the server with me- The shop, which was important to the plot of the Shin'kali, with me. This marked the second time I'd abandoned the server when the disease was ravaging it, and maybe it was worth it.  \n\n\nWith my leaving, I left 5 years of shit behind. 5 years of a game pretty much aborted by it's creators, though even if I hated it, the community was the only thing that made it up for me. But, with the community gone, I didn't care to stick around. It's sad. I wish I could go back and make things right, and maybe have stuck it out with the people that did like me- But I chose wrong, and now we're here.  \n\n\nIf any of you from the server see this, you've got my answer above. That's it.   \n\n\nThanks for reading, if you did. Don't really expect anyone to, since this is just a rant more than anything, but it's something I needed to do.",

            "selftext": "Oh boy, this is a long time coming I guess\u2026 While the issues presented in the following story/rant are long over with and I am writing majority from memory, I can\u2019t say they\u2019re\u2026 resolved by any means. The player in question, Sawdust, was quite a character in the sense that he was infamous for his role play and behavior\u2014not famous. INfamous. He left quite a mess in his wake and actively did whatever he could to avoid consequences both in and out of the chats and while he said he was 18 or 19, he certainly didn\u2019t act like it in the least.\n\nWe did what we could to try and fix the issues both directly and indirectly but it never stayed that way for long, and at this point in time, he\u2019s since removed himself from a majority of the group activity; for a while, I was afraid to post anything about this guy in fear of him finding it and coming at us to cause drama, but now, I could care less for a few reasons, and if he DOES by some miracle see this, recognize himself in it as well as who I may be, then all the better because boy, you have some issues you need to sort out something bad. If you can\u2019t see what you did and were doing through this lense of outside looking in then I can\u2019t help you, but you\u2019re one bad move away from a full on ban, my dude. Choose your actions carefully.\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s a laundry list of issues that have no real chronological order so I\u2019ll try and keep it coherent; as for validity, there are numerous witnesses from the events and at one point we had screenshots of some things but while they can vouch for anything I say, it will be hard to prove it due to the following:\n\nI need to tell you a bit about Sawdust as a person before we get into his characters, as well as the group in general. This is not a tabletop group, but rather a story-driven chat group on a platform that\u2019s very well equipped for our style. The server was made by Cosmos; she\u2019s a lovely person and her world building is fantastic, but she is MIA for personal reasons wasn't present for most of the events; the world she made is an earth-like alien planet with a dominant race whose main ability is to shift between a feral and human-like form, and there are societies and cultures built up around form preferences and mentalities that can cater to people that enjoy playing with tech savvy creature comforts and human like ideals or all the way to animal-minded, near savage tribal communities, each with a unique flavor and spin. Customization was a big seller on the characters, as well as their flexibility, and when the magic system was introduced as a rare ability, it opened a world of possibilities.\n\nThe group was very into community development and Cosmos would lay out ideas and preferences but let others take and develop those parts into canon ideas so long as they weren\u2019t too crazy or world breaking. This allowed a lot of variety and nuance into the cities and tribes and left everyone feeling more involved and invested with removing the burden from Cosmos\u2019 shoulders to provide everything at once when she had medical and school issues taking her away. As it happened, myself (Pooka) and my friend, Waterlily (just Lily), were the most active online and in world building for the longest time, we had ideas and events, activities and other things, and we generally got along with everyone online, and have since been made into admins to give us more control over the server and its members\u2014at the time of Sawdust, we were curators with limited means, and by the time we became full admins, the relationship dynamics in the group had gotten really\u2026 messy.\n\nAll of that is to try and paint a picture of the race and the world we love playing in in case things get confusing from here on out.\n\nNow for Sawdust. Sawdust, as I said, was a teenager (supposedly, but he had someone vouch his age so we couldn\u2019t call lies), and a world class That Guy; he was friends with a old-time member that had been around in the beginning of the server but he himself joined only a day after Lily and I. We weren\u2019t aware of this and thought he was also an older member at first so we didn\u2019t speak out against him for a long while when we started, out of respect for seniority. Sawdust\u2019s friend, Maw, was a good player in their own right but likely because of their home issues and relationship, wasn\u2019t much help in curbing Sawdust\u2019s behavior; we learned later on they were facing some home problems but they never offered to explain what most of the time, and allowed it to be an excuse for Sawdust\u2019s actions and Maw\u2019s inaction to help him, but that\u2019s their own choices in doing so. Outside of that, Sawdust was a loud edge lord kind who claims to have played a lot D&amp;D and knew how roleplaying worked (that becomes evident that either he didn\u2019t or he was just as bad at it when you see some of his nonsense), but because the world didn\u2019t have traditional classes to pick from nor did we use dice rolling to determine conflict and outcomes, he quickly ran rampant, making a succession of self-insert like OCs whose main differences were their jobs and very little else.\n\nSawdust was also extremely illiterate, and never made note if he had dyslexia to explain it, so many of his messages were incomprehensible, poorly edited and written with the flair of a third grader doing a short story essay, never mind the rare blogs he would put out almost always having something inherently wrong, problematic or just generally unreadable to them, and while we offered to help him write better ones, he never took us up on it. This brings us to Maw for a moment, as she was his irl friend and eventually girlfriend, whom we tried to rely on to curb him and help him get better but any time she said she would, it never worked. He would be quiet for a few days, and then go right back to the same behaviors and when we asked Maw what was up, she said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have time yet\u201d.\n\nDid we try to do it instead? Yes. Several times, in public and private, politely and sternly, we tried to correct, call out and assist Sawdust in his endeavors, but Sawdust is a boy who cannot stand the idea of being disliked or wrong so if we even hinted that he\u2019d fucked up in some way or was wrong about a world rule, he would flip absolute shit in the chats and have a stage 4 meltdown before fleeing. When he returned, he would ignore what happened; the only person who could tell him \u201chey, no, that\u2019s not right\u201d and not get screamed at was Cosmos because he viewed her as the goddess of the server. This became its own issue however, when he would take liberties with her statements and advantage of her long absences to get away with things behind the backs of myself and Lily.\n\nThe other main issue with Sawdust and the platform in general is the fact that he hated permanence, and if things didn\u2019t go well for him at all because his protagonist mindset couldn\u2019t permit him to be wrong, he would actively ERASE all traces of his fallacy. There are notes in chats when messages are deleted to show something was there and who deleted it, so we know Sawdust had something and decided to delete it, but we can\u2019t show what it was anymore. This effectively left holes in chat rooms and screwed a lot of timeflow up, and angered a lot of other players because they were behaving as if the actions had occurred but if he erased it, he stripped context away and left new readers confused. (He also did this with character bios sometimes; if he got in enough trouble with one, he\u2019d remove them from the chat and then erase their bio as well in a clear display of \u201cboo hoo no one likes my character so now he\u2019s gone\u201d, or just a weird move on his part in the heat of his fit.)\n\nThe server prides itself of accepting the player race has limitations similar to that of humans and the world operates similar to earth in terms of physics and economy, and we rely on each other to make good calls and open-ended chat prompts for people to react to instead of having a hard system of randomization with dice rollers, and most of the chats are public access so others can follow their favorites around and see what they\u2019re up to, even if they don\u2019t have characters to spare to be involved directly. There is a year cycle and 24-hour days, but the chats are each self contained timelines; they occur simultaneously in one overall world story, but when they start and how much time passes is determined by the active chatting members and the chat owner themselves. If no one is talking, then time in that chat isn\u2019t moving, and even if they do talk, the conversation plays out in real time, meaning they could only pass 10-20 minutes by the time it ends, so we have to rely on sense when exiting and entering chat rooms if timeflow affects the turnaround of the characters.\n\nI know it\u2019s not a perfect system by any means, but we\u2019re a small group and it works out for us because we openly discuss ideas and how to make some things work if we aren\u2019t sure, that way we don\u2019t cause a space-time collapse by accident.\n\nSawdust, however, does not. For someone that plays D&amp;D, explaining basic things to him was surprisingly hard, such as timeflow; even in a TTRPG game, his idea of time made no sense at all, as he would leave a chat (usually after an incident) and then return the next day with the same character and act as if nothing happened or it was old hat, meanwhile the chat either went on for a short bit or stopped entirely because he disrupted them that badly, thus the chat time itself had only rolled forward maybe 20 minutes to an hour, with the perspective that his characters had made an ass of themselves, ran off, then came back twenty minutes later and forgot how they\u2019d been acting, which was very disingenuous. When it got to the point where it couldn\u2019t be ignored, we called him out saying there was no way he could leave one chat on XX continent, then come back the next morning (real life time) and end up with the character on YY continent right after.\n\nHis justification was \u201cit\u2019s the next day though, that\u2019s enough time for him to fly here on a plane\u201d or something like that and when we asked what he meant, he\u2019d assumed the chats all flowed with the passage of physical time, meaning conversations of a few words were stretched out to hours and if he left he could wait a few hours and return without interrupting. It took days and few breakdowns for us to finally explain how time worked in a chat room and that no, he couldn\u2019t just leave and come back the next day unless the chat itself had skipped ahead. Thankfully, that issue remained resolved.\n\nIt eventually led into another, though, regarding chat rooms. Members can freely make chats for their own purposes at any time, and usually it\u2019s not an issue, however Sawdust as I said, was not very literate and never blogged; blogs in the group were ways of detailing characters, their histories, and plotting storylines in concrete ways that couldn\u2019t be affected by random people coming in (another issue of his), plus they were fun to do when chats were quiet, letting people get their story fix out without bogging chats down with their character development if it wasn\u2019t needed. Because of this and his refusal to post any, we knew next to nothing about his characters because no one liked to actively talk to them (for reasons), so he relied on chats to develop them and write things.\n\nEven if it meant making isolated areas no one could reasonably access in order to monologue for a few minutes and leave. That may not seem so bad, and it\u2019s not overall, however the platform we use allows people to follow each other and most of us were mutuals, and when a person you follow makes a new chat room you get a notification about it, so you know it\u2019s there. When Sawdust wasn\u2019t getting attention or it went badly, sometimes he\u2019d run away and rather than write a blog about his character (or ask someone to, because Maw wasn\u2019t a bad writer so she could help him) he would make a new chat room, which would send a push notification through to everyone in the server, and then he\u2019d write a few things and bail on it, with such settings as the back room of a tavern (a space no one other than an employee would have reason to be) or \u201ccharacter\u2019s\u201d room (another private detached space), and leave nothing of value to follow. It happened enough that we caught on to his vie for attention and started unfollowing or fully ignoring the notifications; I also believe we need to delete those chats sometime, come to think of it\u2026\n\nThis brings us to his characters themselves. I say it plural because there are\u2026 four I believe, but with exception to one (code name Egypt), they\u2019re all just rehashes of the first and all act as self-inserts for Sawdust as well as murder hobo enabling vehicles. The first one was his namesake, as his profile and character shared an ID (most of the group was this way if they had a favorite they played as), so I\u2019ll refer to the character as Dusty and the player as Sawdust. The species we played as had some intense customization options (within limits), allowing you to make their skin and hair any color or pattern you wanted, but Dusty was described as a pale gray with very simple patterns, if any\u2014and that\u2019s fine, however this idea of a gray, unpatterned and extremely tall design would repeat itself in Fu (combat monk) and Jessie (uuuuuhhhhhhhhhh), and none of them are related by blood to explain the similarities. It\u2019s our understanding that they\u2019re made as copies of Dusty to cover for the times Dusty had been chased out of a chat for being a That Guy.\n\nAll three had pale gray skin with silver, white or black hair and pale eyes with little to distinguish them pattern wise; all three were incredibly tall (the race has a height range in their human forms of 4-10 feet tall, with 7 being the average; Cosmos wanted most of the characters within the 6-8 foot range to preserve this average, however Sawdust made all three of his to be 9 feet or more, and with others also making taller characters for their own uses, we had to lock the extreme size behind a permission wall to prevent the world from being permeated in giants); all three were edgy sadbois with mysterious backstories no one really knew; all three were impulsive murderhobos, and two of them were cannibals.\n\nYeah. That detail is explained as Dusty and Fu coming from the same temple order who use ritual cannibalism for things; Jessie avoided that fate\u2014he got worse in my opinion, but I\u2019ll get to him in a minute. Ah, right, did I mention Sawdust himself hinted at being into Satanism or dark occult witchcraft? And at one point even proclaimed himself to be a cannibal in real life?\n\nCuz that happened.\n\n{Triggering topic below}\n\nThere was also an incident in a non-RP chat where he got upset at someone who had a character that was intended to be a more villain-oriented person with sexually aggressive behavior (fill in the blanks there), and sparked a one-sided argument that \u201cR*pe is bad and you\u2019re bad for doing it\u201d, talking as if he\u2019d been a victim or known one and that no one else understood or had experienced such things (which was far from the truth, a majority of us in the group had actually experienced such things to some degree or another and were not happy to be talked down to in the way he was); we countered that, in context to \u201cbad things\u201d, indiscriminately murdering NPCs (see below) for petty reasons was pretty damn terrible as well, but we still allowed it because not everyone is going to be a perfect goody two shoes and having a realistic, darker character was interesting. Everyone else, including the ones who\u2019d been abused, agreed he would be a good inclusion and knew how to separate reality from fantasy. Sawdust claimed that \u201cbeing dead was better than being r*ped\u201d as his excuse for why killing NPCs was okay but this other character, Captain, was horrible for being a sexual predator. One can imagine, this did not sit well with the chat as a whole and he fled shortly after when we contested his view as not universal.\n\nThis was also AFTER he\u2019d interacted with Captain and proclaimed to like the character, which was something he also did often; being bi, he projected that onto his characters and tried to ship himself with everyone at least once, proclaiming feelings for a character after a single interaction unless it went wrong. But once it got out that Captain wasn\u2019t just into Non-Con BDSM, it was full blown assault, he dropped him like a hot potato.\n\nThis was also a frequent behavior of his; \u201cmy opinion is factually correct and yours is just opinion, if you disagree then you\u2019re a problem\u201d.\n\n{Topic ended}\n\nDusty and Fu were pretty much exactly the same, being unnerving and unhinged muderhobos with gross descriptions and odd behavior that Sawdust himself never saw as problematic, and he got actively upset when we classified hem as some kind of chaotic neutral at best, neutral evil at worst characters, because no they weren\u2019t, we just didn\u2019t understand! Not that he helped us out with that.\n\nDusty was the first and in the beginning he was just a meh issue, with some erratic but otherwise unobtrusive behavior. Lily and I had our first and still favorite chat going, a gypsy caravan, which became a hotspot of activity and is our go to for introducing new people because the group comprises of one character for myself and one for Lily, and a handful of NPC families within their own chat area that permits any form, welcomes travelers, but uses a \u201cpact of pacifism\u201d attribute where no fighting is allowed within the circle of wagons to dissuade anyone from starting things in a public area. None of the caravaners will fight without a good reason and if they do, they leave the wagon area and deal with it where there are no risk of casualties (certain exceptions being made for pre-discussed and approved drama fodder), so it\u2019s generally a safe haven for newcomers and gentle souls.\n\nThere was such an exception as I referenced before that Lily and I had planned as our first big storyline and it went off great, but it showed off some of Sawdusts\u2019s issues, such as refusal to read back and understand the context of what was happening, being unable to follow the story to know the map and terrain layout thus making him appear to teleport meters away and return when performing actions, performing auto-hits and decisive actions with no opening to counter them, hinting at his OP nature a bit when he attempted to stop a key character from acting, and interfering with other player characters for reasons unknown when they try to move their story forward by stopping or trying to change their actions. (A couple of those are petty complaints, and if they\u2019d only been the one time I wouldn\u2019t bother to mention them, however they were recurring issues and often led to the fits, fleeing and erasure of chats so that\u2019s why I bring it up now, to show this was an early behavior).\n\n&gt;Sawdust writes one long message about Dusty pulling a sword, going to one villain NPC, killing them, then moving on to the next with instant kill moves and not giving us any room to initiate combat or try to fight back in any way, thus killing 3 NPCs in one go and removing any chance of interrogation. He later cannibalizes one of the corpses with blatant action of ripping off a leg and consuming it raw.\n\n&gt;Sawdust jumps Dusty from the NPC kills to the main combat in the span of a minute even though they\u2019re written to be a several minute run out into a field at night, with one other character already running that way, thus seeming to teleport.\n\n&gt;Dusty encounters the other character running and stops her, telling her to go back, and when she refuses he grabs her and continues to halt what is very obviously a big moment for that character and one locked in combat that we\u2019d been building up to, until being told to politely back off; he counters with remarks that she\u2019ll be killed and when it happens he won\u2019t save her before taking a seat to watch (because that\u2019s definitely something a Good character does).\n\n&gt;He still interferes during a stressful moment between the two (one character is mine, the other is the equivalent to a PTSD riddled war machine that\u2019s gone into a rage-out whom both have had a sweet, whirlwind romance that culminated in a \u201cdo I trust this one to not kill me?\u201d Moment) that almost derails the chat and nearly results in killing my character by accident. We discover here that Dusty is just a hair smaller than the largest character (war machine, named Behemoth, is the tallest character at the time, given permission to be so and done with character and cultural reasons behind it, thus his size was both a problem and a trait inherent to him and intended to be unique), and somehow able to, in his 9-ish foot tall human form, carry both my character (6-ish) AND the feral form Behemoth (clocking in at 13 feet tall at the head) whose are both unconscious, over a quarter mile back to camp in a matter of minutes.\n\n&gt;When the dramas winds down with the two from before, they head off to a private (as in, out of public chat) area to discuss everything and he attempts to follow because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be left out of the story\u201d despite having no meta reason to be involved, and no in world reason considering he nearly got one killed and she generally does not like him. He proceeds to climb a tree and mope. Note, there are no trees described in the area so we don\u2019t know where he keeps getting them from.\n\n&gt;On a previous instance, he ripped a tree out of the ground and tore it up because he was pissed off.\n\nAll of that occurred in one chat within a relatively short span of time, and as a note the strength of this species is proportional to their size, meaning they\u2019re in the same constraints as humans with a little wiggle room, possibly with allowance similar to a draft horse or elephant in their feral forms (size varies from 6-13 feet with 9 at the average, but nothing that would allow a human-like person to pull off those feats without something else to account for them. Super strength did become a factor as a form a magic, but that was much much later, and required permission to utilize, so there\u2019s no way for Dusty to have it; of course, if we called him out he\u2019d have a fit, so we often avoided saying anything and ignored his tantrums in chats.\n\nFu wasn\u2019t active as much as Dusty, but often times it seemed Dusty\u2019s character rolled over into Fu, which made it even more confusing about whether they were separate beings or not; he was only around as a plot device for Dusty but a few notable things about him include:\n\n&gt;Sawdust describing the rotten flesh smell and chunks of meat stuck between Fu\u2019s teeth during an oral examination, in an effort to gross out the dental assistant.\n\n&gt;Sawdust insinuating that a female NPC he knew nothing about that was conducting the rest of the exam should be monitored because she\u2019ll want to \u201cjump on Fu\u2019s 2\u2019 cock once she sees it,\u201d when there was no reason for it at all. And yes, that\u2019s two feet, as in 24 inches, on a character also listed as being around 10 feet (according to Sawdust, Fu was the \u201ctallest\u201d character in human form, when that title still belonged to Behemoth who actually had ongoing jokes and actions to show how his size affected him instead of just being clout, thus his penis would be \u2155 his body size with no idea if that was flaccid or erect); Sawdust often alluded to the massive packages of his characters as if that was the only thing he needed to be sexually appealing to the other characters.\n\n&gt;The one time he got into an argument with another character and ran off into a city (a human-like city) and proceeded to decapitate an NPC, then \u201ctakes a selfie with the corpse\u201d as if it was a totally normal thing to do. This was what cemented the idea his characters were definitely not stable and neither Good nor Lawful, as Dusty went on more rampages than Fu did, for all kinds of reasons. When the idea of law enforcement being activated (which he knew about and was fully aware he was in a city with laws and protection) he freaked out and bailed.\n\nIt may have gone differently if Cosmos was stricter with Sawdust, but she was longtime friends with Maw and at some point, Sawdust\u2019s behavior threatened to drag Maw down with him; we\u2019d said numerous times that we didn\u2019t have issues with Maw and if he got banned, she would still be welcome with no ill will, but if he left, she often followed, and if he had a fit, she\u2019d defend him. We were certain she was afraid to lose her only irl friend due to their circumstances, and while we felt helpless because she wouldn\u2019t talk, we didn\u2019t want Cosmos to lose a friend over banning an annoying boy causing drama so we let a lot of things slide for a long time time that we probably shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nWe gained a little more traction when Lily and I proved ourselves responsible and were made into curators; we cracked down a bit on character creation and policed the new ones a bit to ensure they were up to standard, which wasn\u2019t as bad as that sounds. Originally, Cosmos had to approve all character creations and designs, however this didn\u2019t stop some people from being sneaky by adding things later on when she was online, and at first we could only browse and ask Cosmos about some things that seemed off; after learning some of the hard and soft design rules and knowing the world pretty deeply, Lily and I gained the ability to approve some characters and to actively correct discrepancies.\n\nWhich happened a lot with Sawdust.\n\nDusty and Fu were weird, but they mostly followed the rules to a point. At one time, Dusty\u2019s bio included references to being a Strigoi, a type of vampire, which was around the time we were first hinted that magic would become a feature, and we had to make him change it because the context sounded like he WAS one, rather than appearing to be; we had to create a guide on shift regulations because some characters were jumping heights from average to max, which made size changes of 3-4 feet at times; we had various other guides in place and asked questions about characters to suss out if they were problematic or not and usually it went well, but Sawdust hated how we were more in charge now. As I\u2019ve said, the only one who could control him at all was Cosmos, so when we tried to ask or correct things he made, he would yell at us and accuse of bullying, but when Cosmos took our side he ran off for a while; a big reason we were given status was because Cosmos couldn\u2019t handle it all on her own anymore with irl stuff, and Sawdust was an advocate for \u201cleave Cosmos alone\u201d, often criticizing us for bothering her and at one point implying we should just take over more to give her a break.\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem to intend for it to sound like mutiny, but he didn\u2019t want to listen either when the rest of the group jumped in to explain why that was wrong and he needs to chill. I distinctly remember a time when he\u2019d been gone for months and one of the first things he said upon returning was \u201cis everyone still on Cosmos like flies on shit?\u201d He left a bit after when we said we had it under control. (This comment is one reason I haven\u2019t let go of his actions after so long, as it was unwarranted and came from nowhere.)\n\nWith all of this, you might be wondering how on earth it could get worse. Surely this was all the more damage a rampant child could cause in a group with a dozen people and two curators breathing down his neck?\n\nOh, dear reader, you seem to have forgotten about Jessie.\n\nYou see, much of what I talked about has threads linking back to Jessie and why we theorize he was created; needing a new vehicle to operate because he\u2019d fucked his chances with Dusty and Fu, the presence of police forces, the creation of a few scientists and the discussion of the world\u2019s progress of technology versus our own, the inclusion of magic as an element to play with, and Sawdust\u2019s desire to be on top of everything amassed itself as Jessie, the young genius tech major who heads the equivalent of the FBI (a creation of Sawdust\u2019s to counter the presence of the police force that acted as CIA and SWAT and was headed by Behemoth and his maker) and used science to break almost every rule imaginable.\n\nThe FBI wasn\u2019t an immediate creation either, oh no. At first, Jessie tried to pull off being a cop under Behemoth, but he was a\u2026 \u201crogue\u201d entity and often did things on his own and using his own logic (Sawdust meta-gamed a LOT to get what he wanted).\n\n&gt;Jessie enters a club that is known in meta to be a front for the mafia, and while as an investigator he may have a lead on it, he has no idea how to pull it off, fails to explain how or why he knows what he does, and proceeds to talk openly about being discharged from the police force, flashing his \u201cdefunct\u201d badge (we have no idea if he was actually kicked out or if it was a trust ploy to play double agent, but he never talked to the mafia owner to know ahead of time if he could so they reacted blindly and in character) in front of a mafia member who saw it as a really bad threat and ploy and pointed a gun at him, telling him to get lost. He defended himself, saying he wasn\u2019t anymore, but the other character said they didn\u2019t care, the badge was enough of a reason to not trust his words so they gave him a ban from the club. Sawdust later went back and deleted the entire conversation on his side and tried to come back as Jessie, saying \u201clook, it didn\u2019t happen, can I try again?\u201d This only upset the mafia owner more and she told him off that he couldn\u2019t erase things because they went badly for him and refused to lift the ban.\n\nThis leads to the creation of his own group that was \u201con par\u201d with the CIA group and focused on tech and such, which was shortly after a bioengineer was created with specific permission to work with cybernetics because Lily had crafted an entire story arc for others to puzzle out involving a mad scientist, but Sawdust didn\u2019t want to put in the effort to get involved when he knew we would limit him, so he took advantage of his \u201cfriendship\u201d with Cosmos as well as her silence to warp Jessie into a thing that couldn\u2019t reasonably exist otherwise.\n\nAt first we were under the impression he was just a smart kid looking for an outlet, but later we found out Sawdust had snuck a bunch of assumed traits into Jessie\u2019s profile behind Cosmos\u2019s back. Because Jessie was a tech genius, he\u2019d also self-experimented and made himself into a mutant that would grow bone spikes from his spine when angry (that were also poisonous, I\u2019m looking at his bio now), his saliva was acidic, his shift form was like that of a Lycan rather than following the traditional rules, his spine is bionic, his eyes had reflective mirrors that gave him perfect night vision (enhanced from the standard), his backstory was \u201ctortured sex slave that feels gross about others talking about sex\u201d yet actively tried to get his characters, including Jessie, laid most of the time, even going so far as to hit up any female that had remote signs of being willing or known to sleep around, he was immune to most forms of poison and toxin (relevant because poison was a rare trait for some of the characters to carry) and he created a detector that \u201cused the blood of a magic person to detect other magic by scent\u201d\u2014which makes no sense with the magic system, he never explained how it worked, just that it did, and it was never approved by Cosmos.\n\nNone of it was. By her words, he\u2019d asked about a \u201cweird eye trait\u201d which she assumed was either either heterochromia, different pupils, or the night vision, but what she approved and what he made were not the same thing. He took her permission for eye stuff and lumped everything else into it, then ran rampant with it until we found Cosmos and asked; she was surprised and upset by the things he tried to get away with and put the kibosh on it, but he never changed his bio and never acknowledged the removal of his \u201cassets\u201d.\n\n&gt;Jessie eliminated a potential flaw in one of Maw\u2019s characters within days, as this one was noted as having poor eyesight and Jessie gave her surgery to not only fix them, but also implant the mirrors that gave her perfect night vision, without her consent in story (weak yes to the fix, no say in the mirrors) and essentially remove what could have been an interesting trait. (Sawdust did this often as well, attempting to instantly resolve character problems for some reason we couldn\u2019t fathom.)\n\n&gt;&gt;Acting as Dusty, he killed an NPC that hit on a different character of mine that she wasn\u2019t keen on and blew off his advances; Dusty then ate him in a back alley (the man had friends that would go looking for him) and followed (escorted) the female character home, trying to gross her out by staring intensely, licking his face, making mental comments about how delicious she looked, and then tried to resolve her storyline of \u201cI\u2019m in debt and may lose my business\u201d by gifting her an unknown amount of money (she never told him how much) he\u2019d lifted from the pockets of his victims. My account of her debt is a few hundred thousand, but he seemed to just drop a handful of \u201cprecious stones and metals\u201d onto her counter and considered it done (currency is implied to be traded goods or money like ours, he assumed it was gold and gems like D&amp;D). She refused because she didn\u2019t know him or if he had motives behind it and eventually got him to leave while preserving her storyline.\n\n&gt;Jessie was not only in charge of the FBI (self imposed and not discussed at any point with leadership) on one continent, he also ran a bar/club outside of a town on a totally different landmass where he\u2019d been previously kicked out from for bringing an unsolicited pet into a food establishment, which happened to be a tavern and a very popular one at that, also after being kicked from the club mentioned previously. (Petty? Yeah.) He received one interaction with the scientist I talked about earlier and proceeded to not only leave her in the bar (unstaffed mind you, he \u201ctrusted\u201d her to not take anything when they new each other for 5 minutes) and went to shower while stripping his shirt off in front of her in a bad attempt to be alluring. (Chicken nuggets have more charisma than any of these characters; he acted under the impression that he existed, therefore he could seduce anyone he wanted and they should chase him, when all the characters have their own agency and preferences.)\n\n&gt;Despite being in charge of his own bar, he would still return to the one he was kicked from (he had stolen booze from in the past as a Dusty I believe) and attempted to hit it off with a character that, while willing to sleep with someone, was extremely picky. She was a subrace being test-piloted who had restrictions regarding size, diet and other things; by her culture and physical limits, Jessie was not a good match. He was dangerously big for her, his colors looked like \u201cdead coral\u201d (they\u2019re fish people essentially, male appeal to females is determined by their color contrast so his lack of pattern and design played against him) and he generally did not hit it off with her (never mind he inserted himself into their conversation without asking) only for her to go back to flirting with another character that she\u2019d already been talking to who was in her size limits and also had appealing colors, thus making a totally reasonable hookup option and well within her characterization. Jessie then bailed out and went on a rampage elsewhere with all the finesse one comes to expect from him at this point.\n\n&gt;Sawdust attempted to use Jessie and science to overcome some lore issues and physical limitations such as sleep and being unable to breathe underwater in order to get over a built in hurdle with the subrace I mentioned. They\u2019re aquatic mammals and can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes and live in remote areas, often settling in natural cave systems for protection, thus making it almost impossible for people to find them without previous knowledge of them and suitable equipment. Knowledge that Jessie could not possess prior to discovering them (his previous encounter with one gave no indication of how they work because they are secretive, but conveniently he had all his characters know each other so he could funnel his meta his knowledge back and forth and excuse the fact it was several people who all knew something different), and even if he did have equipment, he would not be allowed in their nest period. He\u2019d tried to fabricate rebreather technology so he could dive and swim on par with them (or better, because of course) but as with all his tech, he only made generalizations on how they worked and never gave the necessary explanations to approve them while pushing the ideas from theory to reality in a very short amount of time because Jessie was just so smart, guys. The rebreather idea tried to come through in a matter of days with no lead in and we told him right then that, while we can approve of a rebreather as an idea, he can\u2019t just make and use one within a few days from conception because that\u2019s unrealistic and not at all how science works; if he were willing to write and detail the journey of design and stretch the progress to several weeks or months, as is reasonable, he can skip the science part and at least show trial and error, modification and testing, then maybe use it for the purpose he desired. This was a rule everyone had to follow at least a bit to prevent God-moding all aspects of the world, and to give depth to their understanding of how things worked and justify their actions; he never wanted to work for his answers and always sought immediate gratification with everything, even when it took away from others and their ability to accomplish things. We gave him opportunity and even offered to help, many times, but instead he would have a fit as per his MO and leave, or heaven forbid, whine to Cosmos about it. Thankfully, she was on our side of the fence and agreed to our methods because we were promoted for a reason and he didn\u2019t like that.\n\nThat covers a majority of the more memorable moments of Sawdust and his menagerie; he\u2019d attempted several times to give his characters magic but was denied, several times he\u2019d come at someone in private and accused them of picking on him and bullying (I\u2019d quote him but I deleted those chats a long time ago), never apologized for anything or corrected his behavior and single handedly shut down multiple chats for long periods because no one wanted to risk him jumping in with anyone. Eventually, when he realized he wasn\u2019t getting his way and was effectively excluded, Cosmos gave him another chance, bless her heart.\n\nAfter the cyborg were-Jessie issues happened, she decided to privately construct a new character with him and talked through all the details while giving him a magic ability akin to earth bending. This birthed Egypt, who was very, very different from the other three; still smart but average sized, different color palette, different personality archetype, and he was a paleontologist rather than a cybernetic specialist or anything. He had few or no known ties to the other three and behaved rather well all things considered.\n\nThe reaction to Egypt was far different and it was the first time Sawdust received praise and positivity for his RP and character, which we\u2019d hoped would push him in the right direction with the rest, but he never changed them that we saw and shortly after, he stopped coming online altogether, so whether or not Egypt really stuck with him remains to be seen, but as of right now he\u2019s still welcome so long as he behaves himself.\n\nThat concludes the Sawdust debacle, I think. Tune in next time for the Cotton Candy Catastrophe, about a young role player that was so annoying, even Sawdust refused to role play with her. :D\n\nIf you made it this far, you deserve cookies and free beer at the tavern, you must be exhausted",

I work out a simple plot and we decide to make it up as we go and the person vanishes a few messages in. I am good with first or third person, whichever my partner prefers. I will play either gender to cater to my partners preferences. I am very descriptive and literate but make sure my partner knows that if they don\u2019t want to write that much they don\u2019t have too. Sure I won\u2019t do smut but my partners know that ahead of time and agree to it. They know I\u2019m fine with dirty jokes, innuendos and insinuations. They know ahead of time that I go for story driven roleplays. I am incredibly active but not needy! I wait a few days before messaging to see if they are okay after not responding to me then a week because I get worried. After the second message I never text again. I\u2019m super understanding if they have life issues and personal problems. I will gladly let them have as much time as they need, lend my ear for them to rant or give advice if they want it. I am told I\u2019m nice and caring even when I don\u2019t know the person. I will always be a friend to my partners. I go out of my way to be the best partner I can be by altering my style to match theirs. All of this and I still get ghosted with no explanations to why. So please, tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong or dm me if you want to roleplay. Or even to roleplay so you can help me figure it out. I just need someone to tell me so that I can fix the problem.",

            "selftext": "I'm sick and tired of ghosts. I absolutely HATE the roleplaying community here. Every roleplay partner I've had usually gets bored and dips out before the month is over.\n  First guy was the tongue guy I mentioned in another post. Just a few days ago he said he'll try and get a reply out that night, I said \"take as much time as you need, it's all good.\" He never said anything ever again, and left the discord/removed me. (I make small discord servers with just me and the partner to keep them organized.) Didn't last a month.\n  Next guy, seems pretty nice. We discuss the roleplay, I was sick at the time and had to go to bed, I did, got a little worse the next day so I didn't log in. Next day I say something along the lines of, \"I'm still sick so I just slept all day yesterday, sorry for not replying, get back to me whenever.\" And then tonight I see he left the server and removed me as well. Didn't last a week. \n  Next guy messaged me for MEDIEVAL FANTASY roleplay. Then, when we got to dm, just wanted to turn it to straight NSFW. I told him we'd need some story first, as getting straight to it can sometimes make it bland. He did a couple of replies before randomly jumping on my character mid conversation, I got a little irritated and went to bed, I did tell him I was going rather than just dipping out. Next morning, gone.",

People ghost all the time and even if you put it on your request threads they're still going to do it because in the end they have their own reasons. \n\nHowever it's a special kind of person who does the open slap to the face I experienced today. Where within seconds of me posting my 638 word intro they leave the server, unfriend me, and totally disregard the time I spent crafting it.  Within literal seconds of me posting it. The length was that intimidating to you? It's clear as day in my about me side of things that I'm a person that puts a lot of detail into my work.  I also said it when we had our initial talk about it. \n\nI swear guys, sometimes this whole thing is akin to running around and chasing your own tail.

I apparently talked to this user two years ago wanting to RP but my last message was that I was busy with working Christmas \n( which is pretty much the same as I'm doing now)\n2. I was in a RP day spell but wasnt actively seeking out anything new. Mostly for reasons like what I'm about to describe.\n\nI was on lunch and he kept pestering me asking me to do a slice of life with him. The catch is that he wanted an awkward moment ie like two coworkers sharing the same house or something weird. And mind you hed been chatty to the point of me telling him to stop I'm at work.... \n\nBut after he told me what he wanted I just bluntly stated. \n\"That's just going to get boring real quick\" \n\nAns proof never got a message back yesterday or even today. \n\nNow I'll admit I'm a bit of an ass. But i was tired, working a shift and not in the mood to play some weird plot with some dudes awkward character and I'm the bimbo or some weird low effort plot. I'm absolutely sick of shit like that.",

We'll get along swimmingly OOC.  Our tastes will be similar.  While we're RPing, they'll tell me they're having fun or they love my character/writing/ideas.  Then they'll say they will post in a few days before never speaking to me again.  It's like some kind of weird roleplay love bombing followed by a discard.  This happens to me fairly regularly and has just happened again.  Yet another ideal partner who suddenly stopped talking to me ic and ooc after showering our roleplay with compliments for months.  I'm not looking for advice, but I am curious if anyone else seems to attract the same sort of bad rp partners over and over.  What's your type?",

His actions caused a LOT of drama in the story me and my partner are writing and I\u2019m not sure what to do next.\n\nI tried to introduce a redeemption arc where he comes back from being an insensitive asshole and shows himself to be somebody of note and worth. But it seems like it\u2019s....getting downplayed?\n\nI dunno. I just kind of introduced it in the story like this. The jackass talks to his friends about how he fucked up and how he wants to change. And all they said was, yeah that\u2019s cool! Hoping for the best!\n\nBut on their side, nearly ALL of the characters are saying that the jackass is irredeemable and can\u2019t be saved. They made a five paged \u201cyou suck\u201d memo to him and even called him a lost cause that needs to go away from them forever.\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to end up this way. I felt so angry and confused and I thought for a second that my partner REALLY didn\u2019t like him, even though he\u2019s due to go through a change. \n\nBut now I see it\u2019s MY fault. I see why he\u2019s a jackass and why he\u2019s so awful. But I don\u2019t want to give up on him. My partner\u2019s have characters who get so easily redeemed but I seem to struggle to break the mold.\n\nHow can I fix this dude? I don\u2019t want to ditch him or give up on him now. I just want to know how I can redeem him so my partner doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a complete asshole.\n\nAlso: I did talk to my partner about this, and they said that they were just setting the scene FOR my character to redeem himself. She said that it wasn\u2019t going to be easy, and he needed to prove himself to the people he hurt, but I dunno. I feel like I fucked him up..",

Now what i see this looking like is along the lines of them saying i do something with no input from me. like for real i have had people say \"you reach for me hand\" when my last post i was standing next to them. idk that just kind of rubs me the wrong way and well maybe ever time i've seen it it just flags a bad roleplayer but i've seen it a lot &gt;.&gt; so i feel like if it was a \"bad roleplayer\" thing some one would have let them know by now.\n\nanyway do any of you agree with this or have anything you want to add? do you think this is only a bad roleplayer thing or do you think this is just a problem for me and maybe a few others?",
