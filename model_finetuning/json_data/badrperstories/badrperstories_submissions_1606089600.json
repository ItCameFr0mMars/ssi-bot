            "selftext": "I just don\u2019t really understand how I\u2019m supposed to make partners anymore. Or, how to make ones that stick, anyway. After years, my partner list has dwindled to about 2 or so consistent RP partners that I\u2019ve known for the last 5-8 years. Apart from that, all other partners - Long term or short have disappeared with time. However, for the last 3 or so years, finding new, solid partners has seemed impossible. \n\nSome seem like they\u2019ll be in it for the long haul. A partner for the next 3-6 months that ends up either suddenly disappearing, or says they aren\u2019t roleplaying anymore and vanish. I mean, at least we had a run. It\u2019s a shame people that quit don\u2019t even consider just being friends - They just want to go. That\u2019s fine. \n\nAnd then people I find for a few days. Same ghosting story as always. You know how it goes - You\u2019ve got some plots both of you are really enthusiastic about, you share lots of interests, super friendly, you both talk about how ghosting sucks and it\u2019s time to be communicative. Aaaaand they\u2019re gone. No idea why, who knows what was said or what went wrong. They have vanished. Not in the server anymore, the friends button turns to \u2018add\u2019. If you\u2019ve been there, you know what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nThe 2-3 or week long ghosters really used to sting. Like, bad. But it has happened so frequently, at this point - I just kind of stopped caring. It makes me feel like finding partners is absolutely pointless. Everyone\u2019s so bent on just abandoning you and the RP the moment something happens and you don\u2019t even get to know what it was. Just a minute ago everything seemed okay, now what? Is this what the RP scene is doomed to be for me? Finding partners to fill a RP desire for 2 days and then getting ghosted? \n\nI\u2019m not really even mad at them. Ghosters have their reasons. Whatever. It just - I don\u2019t know, sucks. To keep thinking you finally found another good partner - And it turns out to be nothing. Makes you so much more reluctant to open up to new partners, makes you not want to put in as much effort because they\u2019ll be gone soon. \n\nUgh.",

            "selftext": "So I just had an...experience. So I\u2019m in an rp group and someone messaged me privately to ask if we could do a 1 on 1 rp. When I\u2019m in groups I like to pretty much just rp with the members in group but I thought what the heck, I\u2019ll give it a shot. So of course, the first thing we start talking about is the plot. They wanted to do a sibling rp which I don\u2019t really do but I felt like straying out of my comfort zone a little. The plot that they came up with was essentially that I was to be the elder sister and they were to be the younger. Some way some how we were to stumble upon a nest of aliens and proceed to fight them then find out the world was being taken over by them blah blah blah. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d normally do for a number of reasons but this time I was really bored and agreed. \n\nEverything was fine fine for the first few responses. We were setting  up the scene for us to decide to go explore some abandoned buildings (where the aliens would be) when all of a sudden shit hit the fan. The vibe quickly went from \u201cCome on sis let\u2019s go see what we can find in some abandoned warehouse\u201d to \u201comg sis our parents aren\u2019t home I wonder what naughty things we could do together ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\u201d I halted the rp REAL quick because like wtf? Just to make sure I wasn\u2019t misinterpreting I asked if his character was hitting on mine. He simply answered yes so I was like \u201coh, ok I misinterpreted, I thought I was supposed to be your sibling not just a friend.\u201d To which he answered, \u201cyea you are supposed to be my sister.\u201d\n\nI-\n\nSo, dumbfounded, I asked him if he really expected our characters to kiss...our characters who are SISTERS, and one of which is a MINOR. To the question he said yes and expressed that he even wanted them to [REDACTED]. That\u2019s right folks. He wanted to lesbian incest playtime. And since he sent it all in one message, I didn\u2019t have the chance to respond before he told me the REST of his surprise fantasy. So apparently, these aliens were to be the facehuggers from the monsters vs aliens movie and when we arrived to find them at the warehouse they were to [REDACTED] our faces until they [REDACTED] in our mouths. After which we\u2019d become pregnant and have furious lesbian incest playtime, fertilizing the facehuggers um...yogurt. Because of this the rp was to end with facehuggers babies bursting out of our stomachs just as my sister and I...finished. \n\nI\u2019m mentally scarred and now you are too. If you read this far without cringing at least once...you got issues.",

I had messaged one a roleplay subreddit (can't remember which one) to do a DC role play. We hit it off pretty good last, and I thought we both enjoyed the role play. I was finally happy to role play with someone who doesn't send dry 3 line responses and actually talks about what we could do for later points in the role play. And it was a Harley Quinn and Nightwing role play, two of my favorite characters from Gotham.\n\nThen not too long ago, poof. Sever is gone and they're off my friends list. No reason as to why. I had finally gotten a good role play partner and then they're gone. I was even waiting on their response for the role play! Another interesting story down the drain.\n\nGhosting has been a serious blight on this community. And I understand being busy and not being able to respond for some time, we all have lives outside the characters we play over on whatever we use to role play. But just cutting someone off with no explanation whatsoever is just infuriating. \n\nI hardly get a chance to role play as it is since I have a hectic and fluctuating schedule, but on those days where I can role play just feels great. Escapism itself is just great. But it gets killed when the fear of your partner potential cutting you out and blocking you without a reason is always on your shoulder. Sometimes I don't even feel like finding a role play partners because of that fear, and the possibility of getting someone who isn't a great match.",

            "selftext": "Does anyone know what to do about people ghosting you because you seem to not click with others? Despite me being extremely specific in my request for rp ads. I end up getting ghosted? I don\u2019t know if I am doing something wrong but I have noticed a few patterns so I could guess some reasons why. I could be assuming things though.\n\nA few things that seem to happen before the ghosting that tips me off I might be upsetting people. One is I notice people sort of push romance very very quickly. Almost to the point of it giving me anxiety. I don\u2019t always know how to handle it? Someone flirts with my character and I try to show they appreciate it but I proceed with caution  because it is the two character\u2019s first meeting and I so not really know the other rpyer. Some of my characters are the type to \u2018mess\u2019 around so to speak. I just figure a few post in and its already happening takes me back a bit. I feel bad I don\u2019t have them immediately fawning over the other character, but the forwardness is a bit shocking. Especially because my rp ads tend to show I see romance as apart of the story but not the focus.\n\nAnother is nonsensically aggressive characters throw me off as well? I do not understand how to take in these characters. Especially because they are so obviously rude and harsh. When I meet these characters I tend to have mine just not entertain the attitude, because its so passive aggressive. Also if my character \u2018calls them out\u2019 the other rpyer seems to get personally offended on their character\u2019s behalf. So then I just don\u2019t feel like I have many options. After having my own character ignore it and try to move the scene I notice the ghosting happens again.\n\nDows anyone know how to go through these types of interactions smoothly and not kill the rp? I don\u2019t always think the people doing this are bad or terrible rpyers. I worry I might just not know what to do and I am making things difficult on my part?",

It sounds a bit petty but I've been thinking about it.\n\nI RP in discord and we have this rule that if ever someone take someone's OC they could ask permission to roleplay as that OC and get info. I wanted someone else to RP as the OC but idk how or what to do. I'm open for advices coz this has been sitting in my mind for weeks now, and I'm really bad at talking to people. If only there's someone who would notice that our ship is so great then they would really wanna ship with me, but I don't wanna force it. So like, how do I open this discussion? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "~~This is my very first post on reddit so uuuh, sorry if it's not very good~~\n\nThis is gonna be kinda long, sorry about that\n\nI used to be in a group of ex-friends on Discord, we had a big Kingdom Hearts roleplay that had been going on for a long time, it originally started with just me and one other ex-friend before the others joined. It was good for a while, but it didn't last. Sometimes my characters would do something that they might not like, and they would never tell me OOC and would even continue roleplaying with me, until days or even a whole month later when they would suddenly bring up random things that made them uncomfortable, and they'd act like I meant to upset them. Of course, I never mean to upset anyone on purpose, and if they had just told me immediately that something my characters were doing made them uncomfortable or upset, I would have completely understood.\n\nIt made roleplaying with them more difficult, as I always felt like anything I did in roleplay would upset them and I wouldn't even know until much later. It didn't help that they were confusing and vague about what made them uncomfortable in roleplay either. One of them, I'll call them L, would always claim that violence made them uncomfortable, and yet would have pretty gruesome things happen to their own characters, such as one of their characters' bionic eye literally blowing up and causing a messy wound, and another one of their characters torturing other characters. It was confusing because one moment, you could have some serious wounds occur or a character act pretty cruel, and they wouldn't bat an eye, and then suddenly the next they would be claiming that it makes them uncomfortable and that it was your fault, despite them saying nothing about it previously. It was basically just a guessing game on what you can and can't do in roleplay with them.\n\nAnother example was with another ex-friend I will call F. I had a character use alcohol, which before was not an issue. In fact, the others didn't mind it either. My character didn't get abusive or anything like that, no, all that would happen is they either acted amusing or sad whenever they did use alcohol, which wasn't super often. Well, one day I had my character use some after another character gave him some. Nothing was said about it, until a day later when F decided to suddenly message me saying that it made them uncomfortable that my character was using alcohol. I told them they should've immediately told me while the roleplay was still going on instead of waiting, to which they simply responded \"Well I was too tired and didn't want to deal with it.\" That really annoyed me, especially since I told the group that we needed more communication between each other, and they had agreed to it. There was also the fact that another person in the group had a character that used alcohol, even more than mine did, and yet no one got onto them and allowed it? It was strange, and definitely agitating.\n\nThat's not even the worst of it though. This one is with L again. L had approached me wanting to do some erp with three of our characters. Now I don't really do erp all the time, but I'm not opposed to it either so long as it's actually good, so I just thought \"why not\" and agreed. The three characters had been together for a long while, so I didn't really mind. You can probably already tell where this is going.\n\nWe'd do a few of these every so often, and they were pretty good roleplays. It wasn't like they were the absolute best, but they weren't bad either and were actually fun, even brought some development for the characters sometimes. It wasn't until about a month or so later, that L suddenly got onto me about apparently doing something in the roleplays that made them uncomfortable, and they acted as if I did it on purpose. I apologized and told them that I never meant to upset them, and that if they had told me sooner I would have gladly stopped. In fear of accidentally upsetting them again, I stopped participating in the erps, and I left the DM that we used for it. We didn't roleplay much together after that. L did randomly add me back to the DM later on with a random copypasta, claiming to just be spooking me, and then asking if we could continue the erps despite them having apparently made them uncomfortable, but we never did continue them.\n\nA few months later, stuff happened. Depression started kicking my ass, I got paranoid that the group didn't like me because of it, and the others in the group didn't help, even acted ableist towards me. After they kicked me out I stayed away for a while, though eventually I reached out to them, asking if there was any way the friendship could be repaired. Immediately they acted hostile towards me, claiming that they never actually meant it when they said I was good at roleplay and that they actually thought I was terrible at it. L then went on to claim that I forced the erps upon them, and that they had told me to stop but that I refused and continued anyway, and abused them. That was not what happened at all, and there was even proof in the DM, yet no one in the group wanted to listen and L continued to tell me awful things and for me to \"get the fuck out.\" Needless to say, I got into a bad panic attack and just left.\n\nI also noticed they took my character, changed only a few things on his design, and then claimed him as their own and continued using him in the roleplay without my permission, which really hurt and made me feel like I wasn't good enough.\n\nAfter all this, I'm hesitant to even get back to roleplaying. I'm scared that maybe my skills really are bad, and that people find me annoying. I'm hesitant to even make new friends in fear that I'll just be hurt again. It sucks.\n\nIf you feel as though I did anything wrong, please do tell me. I'd like to not make any mistakes again, as I don't want to accidentally upset more people.",

            "selftext": "So this isn't really any specific story but rather something I'm sort of trying to figure out in terms of actually creating the characters that we all use for Roleplays. I usually elect to have bios structured in the regular old-  \n\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nSpecies\n\nGender... etc. \n\n\\- With the section at the bottom for the whole biography; giving people that're reading the bio a chance to understand the significant times in my character's lives that lead them up to where they are at the time of being used, for instance if I have a character that's been in the military I bring up why they joined, when they joined, anything that happened to them during their service and if they left or not but there's been something I've noticed when looking for partners or just browsing communities on apps like Amino or discord servers is that people seem to either write bios that fall into the category of having the bare minimum information possible or bios that're so long that people lose interest five minutes in or they're just long for the sake of being long, having bits and pieces that really don't matter to the character or ruin the fun of learning about the character as you're writing with the person who owns said character. I do see the benefits to both though and I've been guilty of writing bios in the exact same way; having precious little in the hopes that I'll just build the character the more I use them, or I become so enthralled in the process of writing the character that I forget to trim the proverbial bush so that things aren't overwhelming. What I'm wondering is what do you specifically always include in your character bios when you're writing them and, more so, if there's things that you see in Bios that you personally dislike or downright detest.",

            "selftext": "If ever there was a situation that merited the word ***Bruh*** so ardently.   \nI joined this GoT server ...yesterday. It wasn't a fit, they wanted Canon Characters mostly, no worries. As I was debating whether or not I could take up a CC though, this girlie who we'll call N came in and started venting about another GoT server she's in with 4 other players , two of whom were Admins of the story I was in.   \n\n\nN and her friend A start posting screenshots about the interaction. The story, to them, was that the owner of this other server had tried to force N's character into a romance with his character. When she refused, he banned her. I offered to slide in and mess with him a little, because fuck bullies.   \n\n\nA linked me and I had a look around. They had a template for their app. I said \"fuck your template, here's my character.\" They accepted me immediately, which told me a few things right away.   \n\n\n1) He's not actually reading the applications.  \n\n\n2) He was more interested in a pretty girl coming to his server than a character that adds actual content.   \n\n\nOkay, so I'm in. Immediately, Owner, who we'll call \"Chode\" because that's what he is and you'll see why soon, slides into my DMs. Given what N and A had shown me, I already knew his type. He's the guy who makes the biggest, baddest, most cliche edgelord of a character in the story and wants every female character in the story to simp for him.   \n\n\nHe asks if I want to play, I say sure. He starts asking questions about my writing and how literate I am. If he'd actually read my app, he'd know that answer. I played it cool and just said I usually match what I'm given. He said he would set up the scene, but with that answer he tried to turn it around and make me start it. I played it coy and said I'd rather he start it so I could see the *vibe* of the story. He posts. It's a solid 6 paragraphs. I mean, I have issues with people who use *italics* for actions and **bold** for speech, which everyone else in that server did, but I wasn't going to say anything about it and the content was decent if not a little masturbatory. He kept going on and on about basically how hot his character was.   \n\n\nAgain, if he'd read my character sheet, he'd know my character was as straight as a cooked noodle and none of that was necessary. Oh, and I almost forgot. The scene he set up for us. I'd told him I'd prefer something in Blackwater Bay so my character could meet the merchants. He, instead, set us up at a banquet hall with a feast called \"Love Night.\" It was pretty obvious he wanted me to simp.   \n\n\nAfter he posted, me messaged me to say basically not to worry about matching him and not to feel intimidated. I grinned from ear to ear and sent back double what he sent me. He asked me to \"tone it down\" after that. Okie dokie. At this point, I was there purely to champion for N.   \n\n\nWe played until about midnight, when he said he had to go. I said that was fine. I was mostly looking for people I could play with at night since my main is more of a daytime server. My writing partner goes to sleep early. I just wanted something to do while I was bored and not working. To that end, I honestly started having fun.   \n\n\nHe was a little bit meta. He kept changing things in previous posts based on my characters responses, which was a head ache. At one point, he implied in DMs with me that he and his character knew my character was just trying to make the other ladies of the court jealous with him. I explained that wasn't at all what was happening. He immediately changed what his character was doing based on that, but insisted it wasn't meta because he wasn't mind reading somehow. Okie dokie...  \n\n\nAt the end of the night, I explained to him about my availability. How during the day, I show as online, but I'm not actually available. Just the same, all day today, the moment I opened my phone - he would DM me. Just Up. My. Ass. All day.   \n\n\nI didn't want to be rude. By then, I was thinking I liked his server better. I talked as often as I could. Eventually, N came up. According to him, the reason he banned her wasn't a forced romance. It was that she was toxic to other female writers in the server. There was only one other female character and writer in the server, so I didn't altogether believe that but whatever.   \n\n\nAfternoon rolls around, and I finally have time to write in his server. Around then, someone comes in who we'll call Plague1. Plague1 was chill. He asked if the literacy rule was accurate, so Chode screen shot him a picture of our scene which made Plague1 invite Plague2&amp;3. We're all chatting in the ooc chat when I said something like \"I wish people applied more Dornish characters.\"   \n\n\nPlague2 chimes in with \"no one cares about Dorne.\" I said \"excuse me?\" because I very clearly played a Dornish character. She reiterated \"no one.\" I was pretty clearly annoyed by that, and Plague2 responded with \"I like being an asshole sometimes.\" That's relevant because they ADMITTED they were trying to be an asshole.   \n\n\nI decided not to engage further and just went back to my main server. Then Chode starts messaging me, and it got derailed so fast. I'll leave the screen shots here now. Names are scrubbed out for anonymity, but I left the Pfp's in so anyone who encounters them can RUN.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mn9jqgvca3261.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89693ab1ef5e8ff045a05a78d18ee893144b3869\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tiqfd3nda3261.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18a46525e1352884a12d8f2a192ce257a5f6a6b1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywgv7ngea3261.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6aa142dc3ea9ecfbb7478c561371e82f9044530e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11czgkbfa3261.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d114a21daf4581bce75cefffa5ae67a2fa39d5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imdtjh7ga3261.png?width=1534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cd5a0d8bb872a55c73ca9770ad7870a9bec2c56\n\n  \nMy main issue here is that this... is NOT how Admins should conduct themselves. Maybe I'm spoiled with great Admins in my past, but if a player in my server wanted to talk about something that was off-putting to them - I'd listen. I would not, however, tell them \"this is done, stop talking about it\" and then immediately bring it back to shove in their face. On top that, yo that was 100% a threat. No worries though, if his friends are anything like him - you couldn't pay me to go into any of them.  \n\n\nAfter I left, the two people I'd recruited stayed in to make sure he deleted my character sheet. He didn't, at first. It took them poking him a few times for it to get done. He told the group that my friends had left politely and honestly (which is BS, they left because I screen shot this to them too and they couldn't get out fast enough) while telling the remaining 3 people that I had left because I was holier-than-thou and stuck-up.. Okie dokie.   \n\n\nWon't be giving them *another chance* ;)",

I'm okay with getting hated by everyone IC because of that BUT anyone else treats my character different than they actually should, for example there is a character my character bullies  and the girl she is bullying most likely cries or apologizes in canon but in this roleplay she beats my character to death  for calling her \"ugly\" for once I warn her in OOC but she didn't listen. I thought that's happening because of my character being rude but there was another character being rude as my character and everyone is cool with it, when I RP as a kind character I got ignored . I'm not sure if they hate me or my character or am I being a crybaby can someone please help me?",

            "selftext": "There's this player who was a friend and a former roleplayer in my main server. She made a lot of friends really quickly, because she's just got fantastic social skills. She quickly became the little darling of the server. When she complained about other members, I was inclined to believe her because all I'd ever seen of her was her just being super friendly.   \n\n\nOne thing I've always pushed in my server though is that the story comes first. Take all the time you need on leave of absence, real life comes first, blah blah - that's all fine. What I mean by the story coming first is that it doesn't matter how close we are as friends, the lore is the lore and I'm not changing it for you. I literally kicked out my own husband from the story because he couldn't keep up with it. I've had plenty of players who try that whole get-close-to-the-Admin-to-get-special-privileges thing, so by now, when players try it, it gets shut down pretty fast. It's not about how much I like the players, I love them all, but the story is the story. If they don't like it, there are soooo many others out there they can join. I don't understand people who come in and make a big deal trying to change the set lore of a story.   \n\n\nWhatever, so she tried that with me. When it didn't work, she went inactive and eventually she left. A bit later, she tells me she misses my server and wants to come back. I'm super into it, so she comes back, all good. She knew going in what our activity requirements were, what our lore was, what she would need to do to be able to stay in the server. And yet, a month in, when she got pinged for inactivity and clique playing, she made it seem like it was some big thing where I was supposed to know she was busy and give her special treatment for it?   \n\n\nAll she had to do was say \"hey, I'm really busy right now, can I be put on Leave of Absence. \" Unless a player asks us to be put on LoA, we don't. She never asked, so am I supposed to have just read her mind?   \n\n\nAnyway, she bailed shortly after that. Then maybe two weeks later, we get this weird influx of players, all of whom exclusively want to play this one trope that isn't actually allowed by our lore. One player in particular comes in while I'm asleep and starts harassing my mods with questions that have nothing to do with the lore, at all, but asking them to explain it in lore terms. Things like asking how the community, which is in Scotland, deals with Donald Trump, and being really aggressive about it. Before they left, they DM'ed me to say \"just thought you should know that there is a server poaching your players.\"   \n\n\nI signed on a few hours later to message them back. I said \"I'm listening.\" He said \"not with that attitude you ain't.\" So he was mostly a dead end, but I figured it out regardless. The girl who had left has her own server that is the same genre but the lore is COMPLETELY different. I knew she had been working on something like it, but I didn't know it had launched. I also didn't know that right before she left the server, she messaged pretty much all our active players with a link to her server. All except for the staff. She didn't tell them to leave when they joined her server, but a lot of them did. The guy who told me about alleged poaching is also in that server.   \n\n\nAdditionally, so is every player who has recently come into my server. I messaged the girl to just let her know about this. Maybe I'm old school, but when I've been in stories and someone comes in trying to start drama between other storylines, that's the kind of thing where the Admins get together to squash the drama. She genuinely didn't care. She insisted he was just \"joking\" and that's the vibe of her story. Given that I don't know that guy, I don't know how I was supposed to take it as anything other than trying to start drama.   \n\n\nEither way, she linked me to her server just so I could pop in and make it clear to everyone that there's no bad blood. Her server is serious amazing, and I wouldn't have expected less. It's completely different lore, but yes they're both mage schools. I definitely felt like the way she went about recruiting directly from my server without telling me was underhanded. Had she been upfront, we have a partners-and-affiliates channel that I would have happily posted her ad into. What actually happened though, my staff and I all feel like we were pointedly kept in the dark, so that bridge is honestly burned. I wish her the absolute best, but I don't feel like I can trust her anymore.   \n\n\nI thought it was all handled that day though. We parted as friends, a lot of our players are in both servers now, it's fine. I'm not one of those people who thinks \"you can ONLY play in my server. ONLY MEEEEEE\". To me, creativity begets creativity. If I run out of scenes to post in in one server, I like being able to hop into another and keep writing. Because of that, I don't believe in competing with other servers, and I never have. It feels toxic.   \n\n\nBut this interaction makes me feel like she's thinking we're in a competition when we aren't, and it's just not the vibe I want for my life. We're both in this one hub server that helps give players writing resources and things. About a day after all this happened, someone was talking about how shitty it is when they join a server that makes you apply a character before you can even see the lore or any play. I chimed in to agree and say I didn't understand how Admins expected players to be able to make a character they can commit to if they're not allowed to see anything at all about the story.   \n\n\nThe girl chimed up to disagree and say she loved servers like that, which is fine that's her opinion and it's an open forum, but then she immediately started talking shit about stuff she knows my server does. She brought up the bit about our hidden lore code to make sure players have actually read it before they apply, saying it was stupid and elitist. Mind you, she never talks in that server. This was the first time she'd chimed in. The owner is a good friend of mine who verified that. I clapped back like \"yeah I get it, you hate \\[Redacted Server Name\\]. I'm right here if you want to talk about it.\"   \n\n\nShe went quiet, and then she posted some bs passive aggressive custom status up. That was maybe a week ago, and we've not talked since. A few of the newest players who I saw had come from her server have started being exceptionally catty toward my mods. This whole thing just feels like she's sending random players into my server to give my staff and I the run around while DM inviting anyone else who comes in, into her server. I'm not interested in stooping low enough that I would need to send in a mole of my own. I'm not interested in this bullshit dramatic competition she's trying to set up.   \n\n\nHer server is great, it's very new but it has some fantastic concepts. My server is also great, it's three years old and it also has fantastic concepts. I'm not the one for her to beat. I'm not the one for anyone to beat. I have no interest in a server with 100+ players that I don't know or ever play with. I want a lot of world building. I want to play my characters with new people. I want to help writers grow. I want a MAXIMUM of 50 players who I can *know* and build something awesome with.   \n\n\nIt really fucking sucks that she and some of her players feel like they need to drag someone completely separate down just to build herself and her new server up. I hope she gets over this weird vendetta soon, because OOC drama only hurts the story. It's not going to get her the desired results.",

            "selftext": "Where can I \\*possibly\\* begin?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter being graciously given an invite to a discord RP community loosely based on Starbound's setting by a friend of mine- we'll refer to this server as 'BeanieTwo's Depot', I was initially very interested in finding out what this server could have to offer, as I've honestly been rather starved for decent RP experiences outside of tabletops lately. Reading over the rules, they seemed rather strict and skewed toward a general viewpoint of the owner rather than objectively trying to establish guidelines for a community to function healthily, but I was hoping that it would be balanced out by having a judicious moderation/administrative staff who knew when and where to levy on rules.  \nHowever- My next discovery did not do much to further calm my early apprehensions about the place. The owner, 'BeanieTwo', as we'll call him, had a single rank as owner and head administrator of the server. 'Headmaster'. I'll preface this by saying that this was definitely not a school/university type setting (Not a fan of those really), so it wasn't like the roles were supposed to be thematic. This was just how he seemed to see himself. I'll go out on a limb here and say that in my experience with communities, as soon as you start running into administrators who give themselves vanity ranks for their position which glorify their status with IRL authoritative titles, its never a good sign.   \nFew people who do this are doing it in good faith, and although it might have the air of a friendly joke, the seed of it always seems to come from some sort of power/ego trip that the person is having over the idea of having any amount of authority, even perceived authority, over a group of people. To spoil the story, this guy cleanly falls into that boat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI very quickly discovered this when I saw how he was treating a batch of people who had recently joined around the same time as me. God can only know why, but Beanie seems to have some kind of bizarre fascination/aversion to anything that he perceives or defines as 'Shitposting'. Several rules were explicitly outlined solely to deal with this one concept and each outlined how he would absolutely never tolerate it or allow his community to become what he liked to refer to as 'A Shitposting Discord'.  \nA loose definition was given for what actually would be counted *as '*shitposting', but it seemed to be purposefully designed to allow for nearly anything to be lumped into it as a catch-all \"Stop talking about X\" rule.   \nOf course, nearly every community I've seen does have some sort of rule that exists to catch rule-skirters, your basic 'Don't be a prick/asshole' type rule, but there are times where it can certainly seem like a very shallow attempt at making rules that allow the moderation staff to excessively curb and shut down any sort of talk (such as criticism of the server) that they don't like. In my experience, this was true of the Depot as well. A few people were having a small laugh in general, making some light jokes with eachother which I could only assume were various inside jokes. Nothing too severe or out of place. However, right in the middle of this, the owner started (and failed) to put down massive Purge/Prune commands on his content moderation bot, upwards of 200-300 posts that he was attempting to remove. Reading through them, none seemed to be in violation of *any* concrete rule I could find.   \nOne such offending post was just a picture of someone's pet bearded dragon, and yet once he found out how to actually operate his own bot he deleted them all and started throwing mute ranks at people, refusing to answer questions as to why they had been muted in most instances, and when he could be bothered to actually give information on what he was doing this for, he cited 'Shitposting' or 'Making light of tragedy' (Someone had asked a genuine question about a disease in his canon and he seemed to interpret this as some sort of slight about COVID-19?). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, I joined the voicechat with several other new players and we all shot the shit for a short while as we wondered to ourselves what had prompted this administrative action, and then all of a sudden, I found that I was no longer able to post in the voice chat channel. Or any channel, for that matter. When I checked my roles, I saw that I had been muted. Up until this point I had posted a grand total of *once*. Just a message saying hi as I joined the discord. (I never got a reason for why I had been muted, by the way.) At this point, the owner began posting at great lengths about his frustrations and paranoia over the interference and influence of some other community which he claimed had slighted him multiple times and his belief that he was yet again being infiltrated by them and needed to 'quarantine' his server. Surprisingly, on asking around almost everyone who I had spoken to was not involved with that community or they described a very different set of events to me than the ones he was trying to claim had occurred.   \nTo be blunt, my opinion of the server was honestly dropping like a rock at that point, and to pass the time I decided to glance over their IC lore. I found a single google document, about a page and a half long (most of the space was taken up by massive, obstructive headers that outlined tiny segments of information and seemed to be there just to bloat the document and make the setting seem more fleshed out than it actually was). First and foremost was a massive reference image of the setting that seemed to have no actual credit provided for it, and on reverse-image searching it was definitely not made by anyone on the staff team. In the document, all sorts of random labeling and verbiage was used that had no actual definition for it and just seemed to expect that you would be familiar with it off the bat, even though understanding what these terms meant was obviously supposed to be critical to actually being able to properly take part in the setting or create a character for it that would meet the approval standards of the staff team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter ten or fifteen minutes of talking with several others, the owner came into the chat. We all (those of us who weren't server muted) tried to get him to actually respond to our questions about the punishments that had been put on us, but he refused to say anything for several minutes. Finally, he piped up, and began by slinging accusations of 'disingenuous behavior' at us.   \n(As a quick aside, although this likely isn't something that he could really help, his voice was almost impossible to understand. He didn't have any sort of strong accent, but the tone he spoke in was extremely muddled and throaty, and combined with a cheap microphone and poor timing on his use of push-to-talk, he was consistently unintelligible. This definitely wasn't helped by his blunt and rude attitude contributing to his outright refusal to ever repeat himself. But that's all beside the point.)  \nAs he became increasingly belligerent and pointed in the voice chat, I'll have to admit here that a couple of us started to play into his irritation and decided that we might as well try and get some enjoyment out of this situation, since we certainly weren't going to be getting any through actual RP on the server, of which there seemed to be very little of. To this point, we began to ask him various questions about the lore of the server, since this seemed to be a topic that he was particularly sensitive about. The server's setting was some sort of futuristic/sci-fi deal, mainly on a planet that was settled by Grecian colonists. To that extent, we began asking him what aspects of ancient Greek society were still present in the setting, since ancient, particularly Hellenistic Greece seemed to be the  main inspiration here. He had none of this. It was at this point that several of us who still had permissions to speak in the voice chat, including myself, had that taken away from us rather unceremoniously and without any sort of direct addressal to us of why we deserved such punishment.   \n\n\nThings went pretty quickly downhill from here as I tried and failed to get the owner to even acknowledge that I existed through the only means I had (he blocked me from DMing him), changing my server nickname. After a couple more minutes, he left the voicechat after accusing us of all 'not acting our own ages', and then one by one we were each banned from the server.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other problems were of note in the community from the brief look I got at the place, such as very sue-ish character sheets that were posted by the staff and seemed to give them a great allowance for technology and other quirks that other members of the community who didn't seem to be in the good graces of the owner were absolutely barred from, but the outright most egregious thing about the place was hands down its owner. Never before have I met a more disagreeable, contentious, and bullheaded person, and if anyone was to ever ask me if I recommended they join a server he had *any*  sort of administrative position in, I'd tell them to give it a wide berth as long as he was there.",

            "selftext": "I felt inclined to make a second edition of the protagonist chan story since the first one got so many upvotes and comments. This time, I'll go ahead and get everyone up to speed on my new character and his standing within the party. We'll set the scene for everyone and give you guys some Nicknames in order to know who's who in the story. \n\n**SINGLE DAD / SD** \\- My Fighter/Wizard character who is the surrogate/adopted father of my Little Sister's eldritch demon infant monster.  \n**ELDRITCH BABY / BB** \\- My little Sister's character. The Eldritch demon infant monster.  \n**FISH** \\- The Locathah of the group, whose village was slaughtered. He seeks vengeance on this man but doesn't know enough about the surface world to know where to look.  \n**LOVE INTEREST / LC** \\- The Protagonist-Chan's friend, who is basically, for all intents and purposes, his lizard-folk love interest.  \n**GREMLIN / G** \\- The Party's local kobold. That's it. They're just a kobold. Smol.  \n**P R O T A G O N I S T - C H A N / PC** \\- Our Protagonist, PC, whose an arrokokra \"pacificist\"  bard.   \n**FIRE AUNT / AUNT** \\- A Fire Genasi character of a friend of mine. Who's playing a bard out of spite.  \n**THE DUNGEON MASTER / DM**\n\n**PLOT RECAP**: After I let my first character die as a subtle refusal to be plot-railroaded into being Protagonit chan's rival. The Party had learned that a giant crater had been made near the north of town. They were hired by the local tavern's owner to go check it out. She's some sort of Mayor figure-head IIRC. After meeting my mysterious new character, BB, Fish, and SD head to the Black Market to pick something up that SD requires. While PC, LC, and G (reluctantly) head to the general store while PC chews up as much of the session time as he can. \n\nBefore we start, let's get into some background info. AUNT is not my friend's first character, in fact, it's her second. Both me and Aunt's mun wanted to make some BM (bad manner) characters in order to be able to tell PC to shut the hell up whenever he dragged a scene on for too long, and have it perfectly lined up with our characters.  While my first character was already a BM character with a sword, I thought it would be more fitting with my mood and attitude toward PC to wield a gun. So I made a gunslinger archetype fighter. However, after recently binge-watching The Mandalorian with BB's mun... We suddenly got a great idea.\n\nBB is a sort of JOKE CHARACTER that works really well. A character who looks as cursed as possible is very small, and that is used as a springboard for serotonin fueling jokes. The current lore for this little gnome bastard is that he's an eldritch demon that shrinks himself down to the gnome size so that humans can comprehend his being. As not even the gnome is his true form. So basically, the DM allows BB to look, be, and act as whatever they wish too, as long as it isn't godmodding or metagaming.  BB's mun and I are SUPER creative with this, to the point where my new character was basically The Mandalorian and BB had shapeshifted into the Baby Yoda to complete The Clan of Two.\n\nExcept that BB ate souls instead of eggs.\n\nWhat does this have to do with AUNT? Well, Aunt wanted to drop their new character because of a lack of attachment toward the party. My first character was the only one they knew, and he was dead.  So AUNT whipped out their BM character from the last campaign we did together so we could bully the ever-loving hell out of PC, creatively. However, as AUNT went about creating their BM build, I realized something else when I rewatched some of the previous sessions. \n\nPC had gotten... really attached to AUNT'S first character. After the death of my first character, he tried to force a lot of physical contact in an attempt to apologize for taking the sword of my character to \"honor him\". Since our characters had hated each other, AUNT's first character perceived this as looting a corpse and PUNCHED him. To which he tried to yell over everyone else to keep that scene going. Why I thought about this particular moment was because there had been a scene earlier in the campaign where PC had a panic attack during a combat situation because - \"Oh no. I never knew tagging along to raid a dungeon meant I'd have to fight things.\" and AUNT'S character, the cinnamon roll cleric healer, did standard panic attack calming procedures.\n\nI think PC took this as an ACT OF AFFECTION... and started receiving AUNT's first character as a LOVE INTEREST. To the point where he was trying to subtly get Aunt's first character in a love interest between himself and LC, the Lizard Folk who PC and they had been establishing as a... thing? Or getting ready to be a thing. It's really poorly executed and not subtle at all. Kinda like when you know an anime girl is the love interest and is just mad thirsty for the PC. The PC's all \"Oooh I have so many secrets.\" and the Love Interest is like, \"I won't be a burden I swear.\" like really early RPER stuff that makes you cringe. \n\nSo AUNT escaped the Harem, thankfully. Though it was really creepy and I hope PC doesn't try that with their BM. Though I also do because... like... AUNT's new character would be totally keeping In-line with the character if she ate him as Fire Genasis EAT LIVING THINGS. So. Roasted duck.\n\nLet's talk about the background session drama. Remember how the DM had asked us do kinda do admin stuff? Well, we recently (after inviting the DM to a discord server where all the PC drama was being vented about) discovered that the DM had... not really realized it was PC. In being sort of subtle and keeping the complaints to ourselves until it had become bad, The DM didn't think anyone was bothered by PC and got VERY ANXIOUS about it. To the point where sessions were becoming very stress-inducing and anxiety-ridden. The DM was under the impression that it was their game management skills that were making people frustrated.\n\nAfter having a long discussion with the DM and finally allowing them to vent all their concerns, not only did we get the DM to sit the group down at the beginning of Session seven... but I also learned his BACKSTORY. I know that's a big nono in D&amp;D, but since it was on another server and I've been trusted to not tell anyone else in the party other than BB's mun and some friends OUTSIDE OF D&amp;D (and you people here on this subreddit) the DM trusted me enough to tell me. \n\nThough, rest assured, the DM has given PC ONE CHANCE to shape up his act and if he does not... he gets the boot. \n\nHe didn't do much during session seven, so I have nothing to report on that end. However, if he does get worse after the talk... and there is a PROTAG-CHAN III... I will give you guys the scoop.\n\nOn that note, let's talk about his backstory...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xy2m7f2i1t161.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5abf585a2131a3e5acb2cb8be0443fac1e771a99\n\n***~~because I've BEEN WAITING TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS ONE.~~***\n\nSo, for some unspecified reason, PC's race got into a war in the mountains with a neighboring race called Kenku's. This war went on for an unspecified amount of time, and during this time, PC's father became the most badass, bestest character in the whole war. He earned legendary status, and became what we (PC, BB's-Mun, and some outside friends who know) have dubbed, \"ANIME MAN.\" So PC's anime man dad basically wins the war for them, from what I understand. Right toward the end of the war, he meets a Kenku. He proceeds to have little baby Kenku/Arrokokra hybrid babies with PC's mom. \n\nHowever, even though there is peace and the war is over, this looked down upon. So they go move to a human village FAR but CLOSE enough to the Arrokokra village so that PC's anime dad can keep being an anime man soldier. However, even though they are in a human village, and are presumably... devoid of shame now that they are in a new locale...  PC's mom doesn't think this is enough... and leaves. As a now single father, PC's anime dad begins training PC in the ways of the sword.. along with his sister. He maybe isn't started yet.. but he gave them training swords for some reason.\n\nAnyways, one day, PC's dad goes out for some smokes (Not really, he leaves for an unspecified reason) and leaves his infant children all alone with their very real and very deadly training swords. PC decides to go out because he wants to be a psychopath and kill something! Just like his dad. So he finds a big ole' lizard and starts stabbin' it until it dies. The lizard turns out to be a BABY DRAGON!!! And soon the Mother shows up, pissed as fuck and ready to eat a chicken nugget!\n\nBut just then, like an anime dad he is, PC's father shows up and... No, you are not going to read this wrong.\n\nOne-shots the DRAGON.  \nAll by himself.  \nWith a sword.\n\nAnd you'd think that this would inspire PC to be a legendary soldier just like his pop-pop. Nope! He finds the experience so traumatic that he decides to leave his village as a pacifist and explore the world as an entertainer. While his Sister leaves the village, gets married, and starts a mission to \"End Racism\"... (I'm not joking. This is actually in his backstory). \n\nAnd thus, PC winds up in the village where he meets the party.\n\n...Yikes.",

            "selftext": "I have been roleplaying with a partner, let's call them S, for almost a year now. During our time of roleplaying, it has always been quite fun, but they keep making the stories focus on their characters only. If I try adding some information about my characters, or try to write my characters having any issues/insecurities, they're brushed over as my partner's characters' issues are \"more serious\" and \"more important.\" This has lead to my characters never having room to develop. Instead they act as supporting roles for the \"main characters\", which always are my partner's characters.\n\nI have gently tried to tell them my worry and a few times I've been fairly straightforward, calling them out on this behavior. Each time they \"punish\" me by becoming extremely depressive (to the point they claim they start to self-harm). As soon as I agree to roleplay what they want, S snaps out of this depression, until my characters don't act like they want or until I back out of the rps and the cycle continues...\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to be the reason someone else harms themselves, but it's gotten to the point I view replying to the roleplays as a obligation or job, not as a fun hobby. S gets upset if I don't reply immediately to their rp as well, so this is draining a lot of time and energy of me. Anyone have advice? Should I be firm and cut them out or gentle and try to explain this once more?",

            "selftext": "I will call him R. R joined our server, confirmed he was 18+ and submitted a custom prompt (as is required when joining, and you will know why if you recognize me from my last post in this sub). I am not the only server admin. Therefore, if we choose to approve members, we sort of understand that a sample have to be reviewed by at least two admins.\n\nThe process was no different with R. I read his sample, another admin read his sample. We both thought it was lacking in both punctuation and proper spacing, and were kind of leaning towards rejecting him. When people like R join (who have the writing style but are lacking in some aspects) we kindly ask them if they want some advice on how to improve their writing, give them tips (if they want) and tell them they are free to rejoin after refining their writing. This did not happen with R, as his attitude towards us was not very appropriate.\n\nI feel as if it is important to mention, we (admins) were all adults with responsibilities. We also live in different timezones, two of us being from different countries. It took a couple of hours for all admins to review his work, and a couple more for an admin to finally tell him that his writing skill did not meet our standards. Now this is where it started getting funny.\n\nR threw a hissyfit after being rejected, saying \"I've been waiting one whole day just to be told my rp sample was not up to date!\". A day of waiting is not a big deal (this is a hobby for all of us, after all), and after being kicked off the server for his immaturity (and bad rp sample) he then sent TWO people to spam one of the two channels that newcomers are allowed to post messages in. This is when I got on, saw that the two people had been kicked off for spamming.\n\nR saw that I got online, and messaged me saying, \"You know I can make this stop\". I could NOT help but chuckle. He was talking as if the TWO people he sent to spam the channel were the worst thing to happen to our server. I say he \"threatened to raid our server\", because really only two people spammed the channel saying 'this is a bad server they made me wait THREE days before telling me my rp sample sucked' which is a lie. \n\nBefore I blocked him, he also said stuff like \"I have friends IN your server, how do you think I found it\", to which I responded, \"Then we'll just ban them too \u256e(. \u275b \u1d17 \u275b.)\u256d\". I don't know what to tell this guy, but it was funny to see him act like he could raid our server when barely any spamming happened, and how immature he was acting, as if waiting a day was the worst thing.\n\nIt's safe to say that I don't think he had any friends IN our server, as we all are friends with each other and talk regularly about life as much as we talk about rps. We have banned him and his two 'spammer friends'.\n\nEmotional maturity plays a big role in whether or not you get accepted in a roleplay server. We would've given him tips to improve his writing and given him a chance to rejoin had he not acted like a crybaby.",
