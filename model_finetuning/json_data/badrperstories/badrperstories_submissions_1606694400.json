Well I have retired my roleplay accounts on social media for about 6 months now and today one of my personal accounts got added to a vampire romance group based off of a popular television series. I messaged them saying that I wasnt supposed to be there, in case they didnt know they added the wrong person. They ignored it and kept trying to get me to interact with them. So I finally did, being absolutely ridiculous, having my vampire werewolf guy do dmt and acid. Meanwhile every five seconds some characters are having sex, being attacked in many different ways, someone dies and is brought back to life because all their characters are god modded. It was an absolute mess but it was all so wack. Makes me want to roleplay again to cleanse my rp palette.",

            "selftext": "So I know this isn\u2019t the Cotton Candy story I promised but I was reminded of a pet peeve when reading u/CrusherKitty\u2019s post about bland romance RP threads. I\u2019d started to comment when I realized I may have a rant on hand so here I am to vent instead. Kitty talked about their experience with partners that seemed to expect romance with no effort, that everything would be A+++ smooth sailing, even when it made no sense and didn\u2019t develop past a lot of PDA. Honestly sounds too me like someone wanting an idealized romance thread to vicariously live out their desires, but that\u2019s for that post, not this one.\n\nRather in mine, I want to vent about some other \u201cpoor etiquette\u201d I\u2019ve seen regarding shipping and how people respond to it OOC. I\u2019d mentioned in the comment and refer again to my post about Sawdust, describing how he\u2019d get attached to a new character within minutes of a conversation happening, even if he wasn\u2019t directly involved in said conversation, and since he has issues separating self and character as well as tended to metagame, his characters would develop immediate infatuation on his behalf. It never really worked.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one, though, with some irritating habits regarding the ship launcher that was our group and this is the same group that his \u201csaga\u201d takes place in, if anyone has read that heaping pile of text and is familiar with the setting. For anyone that hasn\u2019t, thankfully you don\u2019t need setting dynamics for any of this because I\u2019m sure this can happen anywhere and readily has; on that note, though, I do have a few mentions about the group in general to explain a bit why some of this is annoying to me.\n\nWe all had an unspoken (later spoken and elaborated) rule (not a hard law or anything, just a general consensus) that ships should develop naturally; while we didn\u2019t stop anyone from planning or making OCs for the express purpose of shipping with a certain character, we all generally moved away from it and preferred to let things unfold naturally, which has made the ships much more dynamic and interesting for us. However, because we never enforced it at a rule, some members that either had low activity/OOC chat time (or just didn\u2019t care) seemed to take issue with this.\n\nTo my knowledge, no one ever went to another member privately to demand ships or directly harass anyone, but we did have a few passive aggressive and over reactive actions to rejection, which brings me to the topic at hand:\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES WITH CHARACTERS NOT BEING COMPATIBLE???\n\nSeriously! Even if they were planned to be together, sometimes shit happens or they grow apart. That\u2019s natural and interesting, yet some people (I can\u2019t even blame kids, some of these people were high school and older) take it so personally when their attempts at flirting don\u2019t work out. We\u2019ve never held anything against a person when a character acted properly, even if it was a dick move, and never carried over dislike of a person to their characters (save for Sawdust after many attempts to not do so finally failed because of how much he projected), and made it clear many times that saying no wasn\u2019t because we hated them or the character, we just didn\u2019t jive with the dynamic\u2014and we never promised anything either.\n\nYes, the group had a very high turn over of first-flirt-to-ship pairings but we put that to a destined bond per the desires of the RP universe, not explicit planning on our part because many ships were accidents. Hell, the BEST ships were accidents, and everyone accepted that.\n\nThere were even cases of failure happening and everyone rolling with it, sometimes on purpose to show it was alright; Lily and Potat (playing a female and male respectively, the same two from one of Sawdust\u2019s failed flirtings as Jessie) started off with Potat\u2019s dude rejecting Lily\u2019s female\u2019s advances and she just went with it and walked off without a huff because in her character story she often faced rejection due to cultural reasons and learned how to handle it. This threw off the guy character so much (due to his own history of dealing with women and their behaviors) he pulled a 180 and tried to continue talking to her because shed reacted in a way he didn\u2019t expect and found refreshing and endearing.\n\nBoth of them were in character and neither Potat nor Lily acted out when the shoe didn\u2019t appear to fit at first. They\u2019re lovely people that way.\n\nTake that and compare to the following, users and characters left anonymous when needed:\n\n&gt;Members expecting a ship after a single interaction and when denied thus, proceed to stalk the character through other chats and interactions or beg for attention of some sort only to be extremely distressed when it wasn\u2019t the attention they wanted. Most notably, the offender butted into an Out of Canon chat room (an OOC chat for test driving characters and interactions before setting them loose) convo between Lily and Potat (playing different characters having a discussion of ethics with characters of opposing lifestyles), then proceeding to try and derail the chat into their favor and essentially telling Lily\u2019s character to shut up though without saying such directly.\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08This is rude just in general, please don\u2019t do this.\n\n&gt;A member attempting to flirt with a barkeeper who was on duty (he owned and ran his establishment, it was his income and life\u2019s work with enough back history that ay risk of losing it would result in losing that character entirely) after visibly ingesting enough alcohol to be deemed tipsy. While that happens from time to time, the character in question was doing a poor job of flirting and we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a trait or not due to their bio being empty, or if the member using them was just really bad at it in general, however the Barkeeper being a professional and shown to be such numerous times, disregarded the advances of an obviously inebriated patron during business hours. As one should do. When this didn\u2019t pan out, rather than chat more while sobering up (the drunk patron had instigated flirting after maybe two lines of dialogue and didn\u2019t know anything about the Barkeeper other than \u201che cute\u201d) to have a better chance at success, they packed up, paid and left the bar in a huff.\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08Don\u2019t get mad when a character acts in character and with common sense. Not everyone is an edgy rule breaker out to cause trouble and not everyone wants to ship, especially if the character comes off as two dimensional or bland.\n\n&gt;One member having an established ship with another that existed before Lily and I arrived but fell apart due to in-universe reasons (lifestyle obligations) and OOC reasons (absentee partner) that got strung along well beyond its expiration date, forcing one to make the choice to end it due to poor communication.\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08Please communicate irl issues properly and establish commitment needs early on or before a ship takes off. It takes two o tango and if one isn\u2019t even showing up to rehearsal then you will be replaced with an understudy.\n\n&gt;A member seeming to take it personally when a female character (Lily\u2019s) didn\u2019t hit it off fully with theirs after a few OOC chat prompts along the lines of \u201cI think xxxx is gay for Lily\u2019s character!\u201d We took most of it as their way of expressing how their character felt but there was no ask, offer or promise made and this character put no effort into learning about the culture of the group Lily\u2019s character was part of; this ended up in their character returning a gift and in that group, doing so was a sign of permanent departure. They had no way of knowing this, but we made sure to explain OOC what would happen because of this action (we uphold the realism of mistakes happening and ignorance being a plausible excuse for certain things, though with consequences) but we didn\u2019t ban them from the chat nor tell them there was no way to fix it. We explained what xxxx\u2019s actions meant from the perspective of the group and expected them to either understand or think of a way to mend it when the time came, but instead they pitched a fit and tried to justify that \u201cxxxx didn\u2019t know!\u201d (Which is fine, we\u2019re aware but you can still do something about it) or \u201cbut xxxx said they\u2019d be back!\u201d (Which might be true but THEY don\u2019t know that and have been told that same line several times with no results. It\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s their group history). The entire thing could be fixed if they had xxxx return, as they claimed, and fulfilled their explanation IN THE CHAT, not to US when we don\u2019t metagame.\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08Lily\u2019s character ended up with another ship partner due to complete accidental circumstances and they\u2019re much better off. Accidents will happen and characters will make mistakes; contrary to your own views, your character is not perfect or infallible and mistakes can be fixed if you use common sense.\n\n&gt;Same member, but this time their own character (male, asexual) with a backstory and history of friendship with another (male, unlisted preferences but later confirmed t be a straight character with sexual drives) had made it clear there were feelings on the part of yyyy (the asexual) which the other partner (Potat) knew about in universe but chose not to act on because they didn\u2019t reciprocate those feelings (because straight male). They stayed friends but there was an edge of pining that made an interesting dynamic to play with, however the member chose to use this in a way that came off as very petty. After the previous instance of accidental ejection from Lily\u2019s character\u2019s group, this member came back with yyyy and engaged a side-mission to find and deliver a message to my character who had spent the night elsewhere with Potat\u2019s character, getting closer physically and emotionally. Potat\u2019s character was happy to see yyyy at first but yyyy proceeded to lay down some passive guilt at him before leaving the message and having their character physically run away crying and then indicating that character had left the entire chat area, leaving the once giddy pair feeling shameful and awkward. For further context, Potat doesn\u2019t hesitate to ship her characters when she thinks it will work out, and is not against LGBT type pairings (she has one now, grown through mutual affection), but she often leaves some things like sexuality ambiguous for long periods use to being the sort that let\u2019s the character define themselves. In this case, while her boy didn\u2019t have a listed preference and she may have started out being open to the idea of a gay ship (IF IT WORKED), the character decided over many interactions that he wasn\u2019t into it and couldn\u2019t displace his sexual needs. It was assumed quietly that the two knew the boys wouldn\u2019t work out because making an ace person uncomfortable or feel lesser due to sexual needs being different was something that they didn\u2019t want to happen, and in character Potat felt staying friends was better than trying to be together and losing a friend when it didn\u2019t work out. (Mind you, this vibe is mostly assumed through watching, as getting both sides of the story is impossible because this member left the group for a long while and hasn\u2019t made many efforts to come back. When they do, they don\u2019t acknowledge what a dickhead they\u2019d been.) The whole thing would have felt much, much different if it hadn\u2019 been immediately after another rejection, and if they\u2019d actually stayed in OOC chats to discuss rather than be dramatic and vanish entirely.\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08Take rejection with grace and open-mindedness. Not every character will love yours and it\u2019s unfair to push ideals and preferences onto another to fulfill you own desires. Sometimes a pining love that goes unfulfilled can be a blessing and present a romantic character arc where your character learns to let go and move on with no ill will. In this case though, it was a fairly well burnt bridge that doesn\u2019t appear to be on the mend. We don\u2019t hold our dislike of the person over the characters so they are still welcome, but no one is seeking to drag them back either because of this behavior.\n\n&gt;A member begging for attention (unsubtly but thinking they were) from a character considered dangerous because they thought it was hot, only to balk and run from said character when they got what they wanted and realized it wasn\u2019t so fun. They\u2019d been given warnings and had OOC chat chances to see what happened, but the characters proved incompatible. Previously, in one of the OOC chats designed for test runs, this character (female) and the dangerous one (male) had been chatting (sort of) and a few basic things proved enough to show they couldn\u2019t reasonably get along, as a is wont to happen when you go in blind and allow characters to develop on the fly rather than adhere them to a strict outline. Somethings you learn in real time and have to react to; she didn\u2019t take the hint and carried it over to canon chat only for her character to then be traumatized. (This member also had some issues with writing style and characterization in general, but that\u2019s a story for another time\u2014Cotton Candy.)\n\n&gt;&gt;\ud83c\udf08Seriously, shit happens. Don\u2019t be stubborn before you bite off more than you an chew.\n\nI\u2019ve got a few other minor tiffs about writing characters and poor execution but those are off topic from this post and far fewer by comparison. These have been my more glaring memories of poor ship etiquette and general snarky RP interaction, so I hope you enjoyed. I\u2019ll make sure to work on Cotton Candy soon!",

However, it was perfectly okay for him to ask me to have a foot long tongue, for well, 'reasons.' \nHe didn't respond after that for about a week. He then messages me saying \"oh I got busy with school.\" But I know he's full of shit because his discord said he was playing a game for about 8 hours straight multiple times, almost every day, during that week, and I saw him actively posting on reddit. Sorry if that seems a little stalk-y but it just really irritated me that he ghosted like that, and then lied about it. Well, here's the update. He finished the erp scene without giving me a size, then all of a sudden he's feeling sick and can't reply right now. I tell him I wish him the best, hope he feels better, and to take his time to heal. While later, I look, and he no longer has me added, so I politely edit my last message and give him a nice little \"go fuck yourself\" and blocked him.",

            "selftext": "So, this in both parts an advice asking post as well as 'I*t this actually a problem/thing people do or am I just overthinking it?*' situation. I'm primarily a group RP'er and this friend I think I have an issue with is someone I met more than a few years back. I'd wager maybe six years of on and off correspondence. We're friends as well as RP partners depending on our own situations and what we're craving at the time. Our writing styles the last time we wrote together meshed really well. She's someone I'd love to continue to RP and be friends with is what I'm getting at.\n\nI play all sorts of character's depending on what mood I'm in as well as what other character's are in the RP. Men, women, non-binary, horrible monsters. There was a fandom RP I joined with her some time ago where I took a male canon who was pretty popular with shipping. A lot of people generally want to ship him with their OC's (which is why I tend to avoid claiming him.) The admin of the group didn't care and she asked first, I thought why not? It died for unrelated reasons as these groups do but I think it started a weird trend between me and her.\n\nIt almost feels like she wants me always fulfill the the guy's role for her romance plots. I don't like romantic arc's as the main plot because I find it boring after awhile but I don't mind them as subplots. For the first ship or two I really didn't mind. It was fun.\n\nThe next time we RP'd together it was a zombie apocalypse that never quite got off the ground. She asked if I would ship with her again and gave a general concept of her girl and they'd share a history. I wasn't really into how young they were compared to their history, achievements and angst but I thought well, why not? They weren't the most out there backstories. Just a bit hard to believe and my friend seemed so happy.\n\nI will admit it was fun at the time to write them as well as the OC I had made to go with hers. I never played him outside of the RP with her because I wasn't a fan of his age compared to his history though. The trend of her asking if I'd ship with her again continued until she asked if I would join her own forum and tried to 'encourage' me to play the male canon I stopped writing for. A lot of insisting when I was hesitating because I liked the male canon but didn't want to always write him in a romance. We dropped out of contact and her forum never took off but this situation about me playing the male canon came up at least twice more before our big silence last year.\n\nSnap cut to now where we got to talking again which made me happy right up until she began insisting I reprise the guy from the apocalypse RP. I've got a mighty craving for zombie stuff right now which I talk to her about but as I am now, I really don't want to write the OC again. I feel like he's boring and his history which I could overlook before just bothers me. I'd also feel bad because I know my writing would suffer and show how disinterested I am in this character.\n\nI didn't realize just how much it started to bother me until I wrote this. It just feels like a really weird situation that I'm not quite certain on how to handle. She knows I'm not actually a guy behind the screen so I doubt it's OOC bleeding into IC. I didn't mind shipping with her at first but now it just feels like she wants me to always write the romance arc's of whatever character she wants. It's always romance.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it but that's how it's started to feel since she's brought up yet another f/m ship where I play the guy. Has anyone else dealt with this and can give me advice on how to talk to this friend without completely offending her?",

            "selftext": "I am huge into Marvel comics at the moment, and as such I've been poking around discords many Marvel roleplay servers. One of them wasn't so bad, but I met someone there that turned me off towards playing a certain character. \n\nI had submitted an application and was approved for playing Mary Jane Watson. I absolutely loved writing her, but so far there weren't any other Spider-Man characters in the server yet. Enter this guy. I never got his name, but let's just call him \"Steve\". Steve read my app and immediately came onto me, complimenting how I did such a great job. A little weird, but not bad. I thanked him and he told me to read his, which I did. He was applying for Peter Parker, and his writing submission picked up where I left mine off, as if we were already roleplaying with eachother. It was kinda cute at the time, and he was a good writer. He was approved and then he got access to the rest of the server. \n\nThe first thing that was a little odd to me was that he never asked for Pete and MJ's relationship status. He mentioned some things about them living together, so I brought it up. \"Oh, so they're dating? What's their history?\" He apologized, and told me he had assumed that by nature of our characters, they would automatically be together. Now, I don't mind shipping. PeterMJ is one of my favorite ships too, but I have never gone into an rp without asking my partner for permission. But as I mentioned, Steve apologized and we workshopped some key events in the characters' history. \n\nAnd then I shared my cosplay photos. A few days after this happened, my friends and I had done a little photoshoot so I decided to show off my MJ cosplay. I loved it and I loved the feedback I got from it. Except Steve's feedback. Most people replied normally, like \"looks great!\" \"you did an amazing job!\", but not Steve. Steve told me I was gorgeous and had a great body and that \"anyone with a pretty face can pull off Mary Jane, but you're more than pretty.\" This set off some alarms in my head. Steve wasn't complimenting my cosplay, he was making comments about me and my body. \n\nVery soon after this, Steve messaged me privately, asking for some ERP between Peter and MJ. Not good timing there, bud. I told him no and he never replied. A few minutes later he left the server entirely. I'm very grateful that he never talked to me again, but he has left me with a very poor taste in my mouth when it comes to playing one of my favorite characters in new servers. He made me hyper aware how people view such a character, and I don't think I'm going to show any more cosplay photos to people I just met. \n\nSo thanks Steve. I hope you have a bad day.",

            "selftext": "There was this time that I was playing a relationship between my character and their character in a slice of life thing.\n\nTheir character was a bit too much of a 'sweet innocent' type for my liking, but I continued anyway out of boredom I guess.\n\nSo their character thinks that my characters house is gross because there are rats and refuses to stay there even to just hang out. I don't really care who is 'in the right' about this logically, I just think that it's pretty reasonable for both parties to be upset about this kind of thing. My character upset because they refuse to go to their house, and their character upset that mine doesn't understand why.\n\nBut they seemed to act like my character had absolutely no reason to be upset about that. The characters argue, decide to just put it behind them except their character doesn't go to mines house anymore, whatever. In-game timeskip.\n\nWe establish beforehand together that it had been three months and everything was fine in the relationship. Which is why when their character suddenly explains to mine that they have been feeling bad about the relationship for a long time, it was kinda confusing for both me and my character.\n\nTheir character is upset because my character doesn't spend much time with them because my character can't sleep away from home or be away from home for a long time for a specific reason. This of course would have been solved if their character got over the rat thing but I digress. Instead they expect my character to drop all of the responsibilities they have at home to just spend more time with them.\n\nNot move in or anything, just spend every waking moment with them. They were playing victim very hardcore about this saying that my character didn't care about theirs and all that.\n\nUsually when people play victim I just bail. This time though, I didnt. I thought that maybe I could make them see that my character hasn't actually done anything wrong and what THEIR asking is actually what's unreasonable and uncaring.\n\nSo my character explains that they cant spend all of their time with them and that it's probably too early in the relationship to do all of that anyway and they're feeling immensely pressured into this when they aren't ready to do that kind of thing. They don't listen, they're still the victim.\n\nWhenever they inevitably ran away crying I just quit.\n\nI hope that this is all comprehensible because I'm not sure how else to explain all this. The moral of the story is: Don't just deal with shit because you're bored or desperate.",

Look how good I killed those guys.  Let's go make some babies now to carry on my awesome legacy.\"  There are plenty of people who are into that.  It should be easy for them to find someone that's on the same page.  Why pull a bait and switch?",

            "selftext": "Hi hi! Young roleplayer here. As a younger roleplayer, typically I\u2019ll roleplay with people closer to my age.\n\nI can be slightly immature at times but roleplaying is something I like to take seriously, and I consider myself mature when discussing this subject. However, many people around my age only use roleplay as an excuse to \u2018ship\u2019 their character with mine. I find manyyy immature roleplayers like that. Shipping is totally fine. But please keep in mind, not everyone likes that cutesy uwu ship you\u2019ve been dreaming of.\n\nI admit, I\u2019m a sucker for some romance plots, but I always make it clear that I don\u2019t want the whole plot to revolve just around a relationship. It can be a sub-plot, sure, but I won\u2019t do it unless there is a main focus.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019ll now introduce you to the roleplay partner I\u2019m taking about. Let\u2019s call them J.\n\nJ and I met on a server and we became fast friends after we discussed the hobbies we had in common. One of them was roleplay. We decided to give it a go, and I\u2019ve been in countless roleplays with her for almost a year now. It was going kind of smoothly until I recommended a new roleplay plot. I won\u2019t describe it all because there is a *lot* to process, but needless to say, she was thrilled to try it out so off we went.\n\nIt was pretty decent. The plot was travelling smoothly uphill, our characters although facing some tension were getting along swimmingly, and that was when the main turning point would begin.\n\nFast forward to when her character finds out that my character could of possibly killed his brother. That was a sudden fast forward I know, but this is where it all went downhill.\n\nAfter about two days of silent-treating my character without talking to them about it first, they start pining for them and it eventually leads to this dramatic apology and vent. Not what I wanted to go with, sure, and it had totally wrecked the lead up but I was willing to cling on. Let\u2019s skip ahead to when her character started acting it was all *totally fine.* Sure, my character could of potentially killed your sibling for reasons you don\u2019t even know but it\u2019s no biggie! Their character doesn\u2019t want unnecessary drama and\u2014 of course theres going to be \u2018drama\u2019. That\u2019s...the point of the plot? And now you\u2019re cuddling my character to death but it\u2019s fine, right? \n\nMy character even tried to start a conversation about that, asking what they were going to do about the whole situation, would the other character\u2019s father stop ordering their character to hunt them etc. But nope! Other roleplay character insisted it was totally fine. Right. Okay.\n\nI explained OOC that this wasn\u2019t the plot we had discussed. I\u2019ll put exactly what J said:\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re just so cute together it\u2019ll be too sad if there was more drama involved. I don\u2019t want my baby boy to get hurt again &gt;&lt;\u201c\n\nI\u2019m at lost for words at this point, lmao. I even laughed, thinking they weren\u2019t serious. But they were. I yet again asked if we could perhaps restart the scene to try and do it again realistically, but that was when they stopped roleplaying with me. Whoops. \n\nYep, that\u2019s one of the roleplays I still have a bit of a grudge against. It might seem like a minor thing to be irritated at, but I was so eager to try out this new genre, and crushed when J wasn\u2019t even trying. The whole romance attempt was just too unrealistic for me.",

            "selftext": "This is just beyond childish and petty.\n\nBasically, I have an anti-hero character in the works and she did some pretty bad things to put her there.\n\nRecently, me and my partner had her fight against their character, who was supposed to be this cold, vindictive bitch I guess.\n\nSo they fight. The whole time, their character is like \u201cwow you can\u2019t fight\u201d even though she CAN fight and was doing pretty good out there. Not only was she fighting good, but she had plenty of skills with her too. Yet, because they obviously don\u2019t like her, she suddenly can\u2019t fight and has zero skills.\n\nEven though she HELD her own pretty good and roughed up her opponent, she suddenly can\u2019t fight. That bitch even lied to everyone on her side saying she couldn\u2019t fight and pretended as if my character didn\u2019t do any damage.\n\nThen, a few days after that, a few other characters on their side complain that she can\u2019t fight and \u201crelies on her powers too much.\u201d One of them was just flat out childish with the whole \u201cyou immobilized me so I couldn\u2019t fight you which means you automatically can\u2019t fight\u201d nonsense. But the other two was like \u201cyou can\u2019t fight! Yelling and screaming doesn\u2019t automatically equal you fighting!\u201d\n\nUm? Excuse me? What the hell? Why can\u2019t people feel the rush of battle, why is it that they have to be these silent conceal don\u2019t feel bastards? And also, just because YOU don\u2019t like a character doesn\u2019t mean they automatically can\u2019t fight or that you can downplay the OBVIOUS hits you got from them.\n\nIt\u2019s just beyond petty and childish. I\u2019d get it more if my character did the same move over and over again, but she DIDNT. she had a variety of moves! And the other thing about it was this \u201coh if you take her weapons away she suddenly can\u2019t fight\u201d\n\nWHY THE FUCK DO YOU KEEP TAKING HER WEAPONS AWAY?!\n\nShe can fight however she damn well pleases! Stop taking her shit away just because you\u2019re pissed with her actions or you don\u2019t like what she said! Stop downplaying her and telling her that without her weapon or her quirk she would lose and therefore can\u2019t fight! \n\nSo I guess people like Superman would fail in real life because if he had his powers taken away and his strength taken away, he\u2019d lose! Or if an angel got her wings clipped and her powers sucked out, she can\u2019t fight anymore.\n\nI am getting so tired of that. There are a LOT of characters I don\u2019t like from my partners side but I at LEAST give them the chance to be strong and I KNOW they have skill. I\u2019m not just going to so childishly say \u201cthey don\u2019t have skill because I just don\u2019t like them\u201d or have everyone dogpile on my character just because they hate them.\n\nI refuse to change a damn thing about her. I wanted to actually kick her out of the story since she was causing this much high blood pressure and the only way to solve it was to say STUPID shit like \u201cshe can\u2019t fight\u201d over and over when she can.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand.",

I didn\u2019t want pity or anything like that. Or even judgement. \n\nSo I ghosted. \n\nNow I\u2019m scared to log back into my Discord. The last time I did I had notifications and it terrified me so I checked out again. \n\nI want to apologize. Desperately so. I didn\u2019t mean to cause anger, sadness, confusion, or negative emotions in any of my partners. I\u2019ll muster up the courage to say this to them screen to screen eventually.

            "selftext": "So the story started with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/k3170v/a_tale_of_two_got_cities_with_pictures_for_all/), the day before yesterday.   \n The end of the story was posted in a comment, but basically a friend of mine went to the server, warned like 4 other players, then left.  \n\n\n After that, 2/4 of those players stuck around to warn others. He had 23 members at the start of the day. Approximately 12 left. Then he got paranoid about who he could trust, deleted the server, and then deleted his own account.   \n\n\nWe already knew he had some alts, so even with this one technically going extinct, none of us honestly think he's done with RP altogether. He's just done with that server/account because people found out he was a predator.   \n\n\nAnyway, after I posted that story, I got two different women messaging me on Discord about how he'd done waaay worse to them. It's all there, in the comments, but that's why I've gone from calling him just a \"Chode\" to a \"predator.\"   \n\n\nThis isn't my first rodeo with assholes who feel entitled to blood when they don't get their way. I'm not afraid of this asshole.   \n\n\nThat said, apparently because both our names start with \"N\", he thinks that the N mentioned in my previous post is me on an alt. Right before he deleted his account and server, he messaged someone with this:   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sgxnegppp261.png?width=302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0276a6b28896fb1ec015f0612cba8349b7941705\n\nThat's a threat. We're all clear on that fact. The wording is pretty clear. N has the full screen shots, and you can rest assured local law enforcement will be notified because - hey Asshole, in case you're too stupid to know, threatening people is fucking illegal.   \n\n\nAnywhozer, it eventually came out that one of his buddies in his supposed \"30+ member posse\" is a hacker. In the last 24 hours since his server went under, I've had the following attempts happen:  \n\n\n1) A random United Postal Service message to my phone with a link *(I didn't click because it was pretty obvious, ya dumb fuck) .*  \n2) My reddit account was compromised. *Cute attempt, shitdick.*   \n3) A notification to my phone with a link to reset my email password, while my email reported no suspicious activity. *Get good, fuckface*.   \n\n\nSo far, all he's proven is that he's an angry child who will go through lengths just to feel validated.   \n\n\nMost of the comments in the original post were positive. One person questioned my use of time. They still might. I'm okay with it. I've been roleplaying since middle school - twenty years. I've seen a lot of predators. I've been manipulated myself by them. This is *why* when I see someone with this red flags, I'm going to speak up. Always.  \n\n\nI hope others will too. Whether you comment, direct message, or just read and move on - know this, if you or someone you know is dealing with a predator who uses RP as a method to acquire new victims: speak the fuck up.   \n\n\nBy now, we all know the story of the subreddit we don't talk about. They stayed relevant because they made people afraid to speak up. The day one person spoke up, hundreds stepped forward with the exact same story.   \n\n\nWith Chode, I spoke up and 2 came forward. After that, I got a handful of players telling me their female friends narrowly avoided his garbage. If I'm the person that gets dragged, banned, reported, or whatever - fine. You are not alone. You have a voice - please use it. Tell as many people as you can about what you've gone through. Take screen shots of EVERYTHING. \n\nI'm not a saint. I'm so fucking far from perfect. I get toxic sometimes too. Humans are always going to be flawed, and that's okay. It stops being okay when you're leaving a body count of actual victims behind you. Chode is neither the first nor the last predator in this community; but the more vocal we all are about instances like this, the less assholes there will be who feel like the RP community is a safe space for them.   \n\n\nI, for one, am done letting people like this feel like they have free reign to terrorize role players.

I've had a couple of people request changes be made to those key aspects, the first wanted a cyote girl of mine, but, didn't want her to be a furry of any level, why I agreed to this I do not know. That RP fell apart when they asked me to write a starter (after saying they would and then just not for 2 days without saying anything) and got mad at me for writing a starter of the scenerio we'd been discussing.\n\nThe second instance is much shorter, I wrote a prompt specifying that I want to do gay things with a specific boy from my collection, and I get a response saying \"I would be a lot more interested if they were a girl.\" like, dude, did you even read the FIRST TWO LINES of the prompt, or did you just skip to the setting info and assume that something I so heavily specified was unimportant to what I was writing a prompt for?",

            "selftext": "I know it's a real world thing, but it's kind of frustrating to deal with it in RP groups too.\n\nMost of my characters are genuinely nice people, a few bad seeds here and there but whatever, but my nice ones always have to deal with people thinking my character being nice means that they are a romantic interest without telling me first. This happens regardless of what gender I play and depends on who I'm RPing with.\n\nOne of my girls is an absolute sweetheart. She's rather nice and caring, but is also a lonely people pleaser with low self esteem. As you can imagine, she is extremely friendly and sometimes nags her friends if they aren't properly taking care of themselves like not eating or not sleeping. Basically being a worry wart/mother hen type.\n\nNever in her monologues do I even imply her having romantic feelings for another person, yet so many people always assume she does, even those that aren't even trying to court her. Her half brother in the group? Teasing her or implying a guy she hung out with ONCE was gonna 'have trouble if he broke her heart'. Another guy she hung out with only a couple of times and went to visit in the hospital after he got injured (and she didn't even know he was hospitalized IC, the member just asked me to send her by to visit him and I complied because he seemed bored) and he just HOLDS HER HAND UNPROMPTED AND MONOLOGUES ABOUT HOW HE'S DRAWN TO HER???\n\nSIR, YOUR CHARACTER ALREADY HAS A GIRLFRIEND.\n\nAnd one my boys deals with a similar thing, but more from female characters. He's basically a go with the flow, helpful guy that's easy to get along with because he's a softie that hates unnecessary trouble or drama. \n\nCue the girls that start monologuing their 'main character energy' by having their characters try to be effortlessly pretty. There's only so much one can see you typing about your character's hair flowing in the wind or accidentally brushing against them before the intention of the thread is obvious.\n\nI get it.\nIf someone wants a ship, they probably want a ship. But it hurts NO ONE to ask first, even if it's just asking to test the waters to see if they vibe well together, because otherwise, I'll be approaching the thread completely platonically while the other person is already secretly planning out first kisses and baby names.",

            "selftext": " \n\nThere is nothing worse than when you witness the following, whether you are a victim or an observer. Two people who want their characters to be in a relationship and you can see some potential chemistry there\u2026 Perhaps they might be too young, or idealistic takes on relationships, but hey ho. Then, they proceed to scupper it, without even realising they\u2019re scuppering it.\n\nThe build up is always the same. \n\nThe characters will always blush and do a bit of \u201cwh-what is this feeling?!\u201d sort of RPing. There will be little to no chemistry, or getting to know each other, or investigation of each other beyond finding the other individual cute and wanting to mindlessly pursue this newfound crush. \n\nThen (sometimes within the first interaction!), they\u2019ll propose a relationship in one way or another. And of course, they\u2019re perfect together! There is no awkwardness (beyond awkwardness for the sake of being cute), no growing understanding of the other\u2019s love language, no bumpiness in how they gel, or sorting out each other\u2019s boundaries, because of course both characters are as understanding as possible towards the other, like they\u2019ve been together for decades upon decades. It\u2019s love at first sight and they\u2019re soulmates. Why? Because they said so.\n\nThen, within a week of knowing each other, they\u2019ll be comfortable enough to play tonsil tennis in public and oftentimes, the roleplayers won\u2019t know how to express that their characters are in love with each other if they aren\u2019t committing a shameful and embarrassing amount of poorly written PDA. Their first kiss is only noteworthy based on the fact that it\u2019s their first kiss, something that both RPers treat as a necessity to occur to demonstrate their character\u2019s growing relationship, rather than something they\u2019re looking forward to making important.\n\nAnd of course, declarations of love are thrown around like sweets on Halloween night. \u201cI love you,\u201d is a phrase that is not said with any emotion, or for any reason, it\u2019s simply something both RPers throw out to demonstrate that *yes indeed, our characters are in love, would people who aren\u2019t in love kiss, cuddle and compliment each other so much?!*\n\nAnd then it all devolves. What more is there to do when both characters are madly in love and in a honeymoon period that never ends? What more is there to do when they make out in public and spout \u201cI love you?\u201d When they do nothing but kiss, cuddle and give each other endless, soppy compliments? \n\nI once saw two \u201cromance\u201d RPers have their character\u2019s most important question to each other be what cute pet names they should use. They never talked about their home life, personal beliefs and ethics, backstories, or testing the waters on what the other might be okay with.\n\nHow do you have fun doing such a thing? How do you have fun when you\u2019re almost permanently locked into an endless cycle of kissing, hugging, declarations of love and never ending compliments? There is no extra flavour, no extra thought and hell, the chemistry is non-existent, they are only in love because the authors of the characters compel it. These couples are particularly prominent in group RPs, who want to demonstrate how cute their characters are and sometimes do some flexing about it as well. Nothing also baffles me more than when people compliment such dynamics, when they\u2019re about as deep as an inch of water.",

            "selftext": "Okay,  so privacy's sake we'll be using an alias for this person, as I believe they still lurk around. We'll call them Jimothy.  Now I've been roleplaying for fifteen years or so, I've got quite a bit of experience and I've done it across multiple platforms. Tumblr, reddit, discord servers, you name it and I've probably done it or tried to.  Now, one night about two years ago I get a friend request on discord, I accept it and it's someone wanting to discuss a potential roleplay. I agree to chat with them, bounce ideas off of each other, etc. It is Jimothy, now I haven't posted an rp ad anywhere in at least two months at this point, so I ask Jimothy where they found my discord tag, they tell me they're not sure, \"can't remember.\" I'm like, yeah okay. I've got ADHD, I forget where I've seen shit, etc, I get it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe chat ooc quite a bit. I can be quite a conversational rp partner, I'm not opposed to forming actual friendships if they're organic and genuine. But Jimothy was a little too interested in us becoming friends, etc. They over shared about their personal lives right out of the gate and at the start of our friendship. One of their first \"stories,\" they told me was about how they got bullied off of tumblr. Apparently a small group of younger people (late teens/early twenties) decided to \"falsely\" accuse Jimothy of being a pedo for \"posting smut with a teenage character.\" Jimothy swore up and down this was all out of context, and that it spread on twitter and eventually got reported to the police and their place of employment at the time. Jimothy got \"doxxed,\" and lost their job, etc. They had to turn over all electronic devices to the police and got them back some time later. Now, when I asked who did these things to Jimothy they could never give me a straight answer, which should have been another red flag but I just wanted to move away from that conversation. I stay Jimothy's discord penpal for a while, we roleplay off and on, more off than on. But they always seem to want to talk to me a few times a week and I allow it, Jimothy seemed like a lonely person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am very happily married and never make an attempt to hide that from Jimothy. It still never kept Jimothy from saying things along the lines of, \"I'd never date someone like you.\" (I'm very fucking visibly queer). To \"if you're ever single let me know,\" the next week.  Now me being the doormat of a human that I am look past all of this for well over a year, we stay friends. Usually our conversations are fandom related, south park, stephen king books, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Jimothy is in the same state as me and we'd talked about our locations a few times, etc. They're going to be in my area for a night or two and want to know if I want to hang out, I'm like: yeah sure. We hang out, we chat about some in depth life shit, it goes VERY well. I feel like we're actually closer and that maybe their dry tone just wasn't being relayed very well over the internet. I actually feel closer to them than ever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in a discord room with them and some of their other friends, I mention that I'd found someone that's wanting to rp a specific theme that I'm interested in.  Lets just say vaccuum cleaner salesmen without putting this new rper in blast. It's a rare topic and I don't want them to be easily found, etc. So I excitedly tell this group that I've found someone to rp vacuum cleaner salesman stuff with.  Jimothy is like, \"no that's fucking disgusting, Grim. Give me your discord login right now so I can delete and block them for you.\"   I'm like, \"no Jimothy, I really want to roleplay vacccum cleaner salesmen with this person and they're really nice.\"  Lets call this new vaccuum cleaner roleplayer Basil. Basil and I hit it off OOC and IC immediately. They're sweet, nice, mature, communicate well, everything you'd want in a partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Jimothy shows in this group room on discord that they've added Basil. I'm like, \"hey that's Basil, I love Basil! Be nice to Basil!\" Jimothy is like, \"When am I never nice to someone?\" I just dismiss the conversation and go AFK.  Basil voices to me one night that someone they added through reddit was being mean to them for asking for a writing sample, I don't think much of it. I woke up to Jimothy ranting and leaving a stream of messages about how horrible my friend Basil is. \"Your friend Basil is a nasty cunt.\" And I'm like, whoa there that's a fucking horrible thing to say to someone. Long story short Basil got so uncomfortable with their entire exchange they removed Jimothy from their discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJimothy then proceeded to message Basil's reddit account and continued to say a bunch of horrible, sexist things about them, insulting them. \"Way to be a nasty fucking cunt for no reason.\" So Basil reports Jimothy to the subreddit mods, Basil gets banned, expectantly so. Jimothy then loses their absolute shit on me, telling me that they don't see how I can be friends with Basil at all, etc. That I should get rid of them/block them. I'm like, I'm not going to do that. I've seen the screenshots, you were being an ass for no reason. They lose their absolute shit on me and rant about how I'm not really their friend, basically have the melt down at the level of a fifteen year old and block me.   \n\n\nNow, what makes this extra creepy is I later realized that the advertisement ad that Jimothy answered? Was the vaccuum cleaner salesman rp ad. So basically, Jimothy was trying to manipulate the situation so that I couldn't/wouldn't find other rp partners. Looking back on the two years I've known them, I'm pretty sure this was happening the entire fucking time.",

            "selftext": "Okay. So basically I\u2019m role playing with my partner about some sort of AOT spinoff. Not bad, right? Everything\u2019s cool and awesome.\n\nExcept not anymore.\n\nThings are starting to become really stupid and dramatic right now. It all started when their villain character decided to lie and abduct several former Soldiers to join their cause. Their character essentially sat up and lied to them about the opposing side, saying that they kill Titans for pleasure and not for peace. They said that Titans are kind and thoughtful creatures, and that the other soldiers are these ravenous beasts who just want to kill them and themselves.\n\nThey made people like Levi, Hange, and even Armin look like sadistic mass murderers. Why? Because their villain character is secretly a Titan themselves, wanting to trick and deceive the lost soldiers into their cause.\n\nSo now, the soldiers who left their post are with the villain. And almost EVERYDAY they have something dramatic and heated to say about the otherside. \u201cOh they\u2019re backwards monsters! They\u2019re demonic wretches!\u201d\n\nAnd the other side, trying to defend themselves, are automatically called childish, stupid, and \u201cunaware of what bullying is.\u201d\n\nLiterally. My OC called out their OC for bullying them and making them feel like shit. And their Oc just sneered and told them to essentially suck it up, and that they WERENT bullying them and they were just \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d.\n\nIn fact, it seems like the whole story is supporting the people who viciously insulted the soldiers for no other reason than to promote hatred and division. Yet the other side is getting praised to high heaven while the SOLIDERS are getting called all these stupid names.\n\nHow DARE they tell the other side they\u2019re being stuck up assholes? The other side CLEARLY did nothing wrong!\n\nUgh. Anyway.  I feel like I\u2019m slipping into a victim mentality. I feel like I\u2019m just fighting a losing battle here. Clearly being an asshole gets you rewards while the other side is callously called all these names and now bullying apparently doesn\u2019t exist. and their side of the story doesn\u2019t matter. They can get called murderers and all that but it\u2019s not demoralizing or dehumanizing at all. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m tired of this dramatic \u201cthey\u2019re right\u201d battle because that\u2019s not what the story is supppsed to be about. It\u2019s not about picking teams and telling the Villains that they\u2019re right and the other side were just big whiny babies about it.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be a story about how easily people can get captured and swindled into the villain business and how the HEROES can get them out! That\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about! But it\u2019s becoming this dramatic battle of they\u2019re right and the other soldiers are stupid little babies.\n\nIt just feels like OOC that my partner thinks the characters SHOULD lambaste and insult the other side for calling them bullies because they ARE being bullies to the other characters. It\u2019s like she\u2019s this fucking block of ice who just doesn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nShe\u2019s even making some Canon Characters pick sides here! Some of the GOOD Canon Characters even said \u201cman I feel for the soldiers who got taken away. Maybe those other guys were just playing around and being childish\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just stupid. And I\u2019m getting tired of it. I just want the story to make sense, and for their childish \u201cI\u2019m right and bullying doesn\u2019t exist\u201d mantra to end.",

Everything was fine, for a while, then one of the mods (who was not listed officially as a mod of the chat) threatened to ban me and my friend for loli things, based on a rule that wasn't listed, or being enforced by any other mod. I didn't know at the time that there was meant to be a three strike system in the chat, as that wasn't listed or enforced either. The next day, I found that the mod who threatened to ban me turned a blind eye to cubs (underage furries) while singling out me and my friend for having more anime style young looking muses. So, I contacted the chat's owner about this, got nothing back, about a week later a no lolis rule was officially added to the chat.\n\nI obeyed this rule, but over time nearly ever other user, and all the moderators except 1, decided they didn't like me because I had played lolis in the chat at all ever, some of them having lolis of their own that apparently don't count due to being slimes or shapeshifters or whatever, excuses I'm all but certain would be shot down if I were to use them. On top of that, the chat's owner didn't follow any of the rules of his own chat and would ban users without warning for pointing out the double standard.\n\nThe breaking point for me was when the owner gave a friend of mine a strike for using a hyper muse (even though the chat owner used them all the time, and so did others, and there was no rule against it) and then pretended to ban him for 3 months before changing it to a lifetime ban when he pointed out no fewer than 5 people, including the chat's owner, breaking that unlisted rule over the course of the last hour. when you get banned you only see the first ban message so my friend wouldn't have known he was permabanned if I hadn't told him, since by that point I had my own chat and my friends had all semi-permanently migrated over.\n\nIf I talked to my friends about it I'm sure I could find plenty of other stories of the chat's owner abusing his power, but I'm just here to report what I saw and experienced.",

            "selftext": "I try and go for horror and apocalyptic themes in RP because it's something I really love but I come across so many groups in that genre that *require* dice rolling. For landing hits, for finding loot, and even just for traveling between topics (Granted that one does sound a bit interesting) On one hand I can understand. You want to deter powering gaming and folk who want their OC's to have the best equipment, or become zombie Rambo.\n\nBut if that were the case why not have rules and actually enforce them? Warnings, muting, and outright kicking folk if they continuously break the rules. Yes, it can be an issue but one you can filter out because not every RP'er will power game at every opportunity. You'll be left with people who will follow those rules. It just feels like people aren't necessarily trusted with their own character's actions. I know you could work around botched rolls as you see it work in tabletop gaming but for RP it just feels a bit too constricting and I don't want to have to roll a die every time I want to try landing a hit on anything or my OC is looking for things.\n\nI did give it a go with a setting that was uncommon and absolutely fascinating to me despite my usual aversion to dice systems. Not all staff but this staff just left a sour taste in my mouth because they kept acting like dice were the superior option in RP. That their RP system was inherently better than ones without said system.\n\nIt's not that I necessarily hate dice systems. If implemented I think it could be fun under certain circumstances. If it could affect how the environment reacts to your character perhaps but I just find it restricting when applied to an OC.",

If you apply for an action roleplay with fantasy aspects (and I make it clear that I am not looking for ERP), stop trying to constantly include your character trying to seduce their enemy (obviously, I am not talking about characters who magic abilities include being seductive).\n\nI mean situations like this: \n\n\\-Our characters go into a dungeon, soon, they will face a difficult and scary enemy. Your charac\n\nter constantly fantasizes about how this huge orc will fuck them in the ass, how long their cock is, and so on. Even if it is just a joke and no actual sex will happen, it makes your character look like a total idiot and destroys the dark atmosphere of the roleplay. If it is a comedy rp, okay, but please for the love of God invent a character whose only joke is not just 'Teehee I am super horny would fuck scary monster' because it gets old really quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I invent a character who is a shadow monster without a human form. Your character will ask repeatedly if this monster could turn into a human form, if the human form is hot, if the human form is a sexy himbo. It destroys every effort that I put into creating a scary monster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Your female character spends her whole time flirting with the other female characters, crossing their boundaries and almost bordering on sexual assault. Every other female characters gets constantly objectified by them in a way that reminds me of the most misogynistic male character, but wait, it is okay, because she is a woman. The evil queen? She is not afraid of her, even though she has killed countless of her friends, because in her eyes the queen is a 'hot dominant milf who should step on me uwu'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it is a comedy rp, this might be fine. But in a somewhat serious roleplay...would you really expect that this kind of behavior makes your character well liked? Most characters would probably be super uncomfortable in their presence and avoid them. If you are scared to death by an enemy and your mission-partner would not try to comfort you, but instead go on and on about how they want to feel the monster's thick cock, than that is just creepy asshole behavior.\n\nI simply don't get why some people who always complain about straight male characters turning everything sexual in uncomfortable ways do the same with their gay characters. It is unpleasant and not less weird than with straight characters, in my opinion. Not everyone wants to know the exact details of your characters sex lifes.",

I figured we were both adults and we could communicate effectively. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nOnce we got heavily into the roleplay, I made a joke about my character basically saying \u201cbye, I\u2019m moving on\u201d to their character, leaning them for adventure and other things. \n\nThey immediately blew up, accusing me of trying to make them jealous and that they were extremely attached to the characters, and how dare I do awful things to my character including noncon. I stopped them right there. I, in now way, even remotely suggested noncon, or submitting my character to such a fate. \n\nI told them I need to step back and think about the situation because their reaction was way over the top for me to handle. I went quiet for the rest of the day, got back on, and they apologize and stated that they didn\u2019t KNOW me or my sense of humor, even though we had been joking the entire time we were roleplaying. People joke about their characters in funny situations all the time, right? \n\nThey also told me to stop talking about myself to them because I was giving too personal information out like my age, the state I lived in, and the fact I was married? \n\nThey also began calling me by the canon character\u2019s name, which didn\u2019t sit well with me. I kept roleplaying with them, however, posting when they posted and noticed their responses were getting shorter and less frequent. They said that they were into another roleplay more than ours, which is totally fine by me.\n\nA few weeks later I wasn\u2019t feeling it anymore, and I told them that I didn\u2019t have inspiration at the moment and I would have to end it. They immediately deleted the server and unfriended me before I could even say anything else. \n\nWhich, I guess was a good save for me, really.

Sometimes more, sometimes less; it depends on the specific circumstances. If the current events within the RP are slow-paced, then I write more. The personal rule I follow is that I never write my posts in such a way that my partner is unable to play their own character, and I expect the same courtesy.\n\nSo, when other RPers have this minimum length, usually they end up either deciding some of my character's actions, or not allowing me a chance to react to what they're doing. It takes away my autonomy, and I have zero patience for it.\n\nFor example, I had one partner for whom every post skipped forward like 4 hours. Do you really think my character is going to do exactly what you're planning for such a long stretch of time? Are they just supposed to sit there like a statue, since you didn't give me a chance to write any actions for them?\n\nEven worse, when, in order to meet their limit of \"seven lines per post\", another partner actually decided my character's actions for me. Seriously? If you're not going to allow me to react and reply, if you're just going to dictate everything yourself, then you don't need me here. RP with yourself. \n\n/end rant",
