It'll be my first time really branching out from my group, and I know ghosting is an issue lately with reddit ads, but I'm pretty chill about it. It's their loss essentially, but I still get something out of it, even if it's just world building or character development.\n\nSo yeah, where do you guys post?\n\nThanks in advance.",

And I received an inbox message. The player explained he had not roleplayed in a while and and was interested.\n\nWe knocked some details out and started playing. We were good, in my opinion. I'm not a writer, never claimed to be, but I try, and hope that it shows. I even shared this mindset with the ayer I. Question several times to which he proclaimed I was doing fine and it was all good.\n\nWe roleplayed for a few days, killin the story, character developement and stuff when he suddenly went dark, blocked me and what not.\n\nNormally I wouldn't have thought twice, but I was really enjoying the story, and per his own words, he was excited about where it was going. Now its important to note, I was upfront about not being a writer and finding it difficult to post replies longer then a couple of paragraphs.\n\nI decided to reach out in the DM he originally and asked him. Never once was I mean or bitter. I did ask why he blocked me, but never in a mallace way. He shot back, mentioned that he felt the story was cringy and that I was not good enough to play with him essentially. I, again, would normally drop it and move on with my life but heres what really pisses me off and the true moral of this story. \n\nIf you're not happy with the direction a story is heading, or if your partner isn't performing the way youd want, tell them. One of two things can happen really, they can either be petty and ghost, or, like I would have, tried to improve. Thats my rant and I appreciate the time taken to read my ramblings!",

I hate having to tell roleplay partners I've lost interest when in reality it's just my dumb brain not allowing me to like the Fandom/subject anymore.\n\nSometimes I'll actually be really into their writing, or the story we've picked, but I can't get myself to care cause my mind has picked another subject to fixate on.

I've told someone that I was sick and they decided to remind me again after two days.\n\nReading back on my old rps helps me to go to sleep a lot, and having the story mixed with constant ooc bumping just makes me not even interested in the rp anymore even if I was before they had done all the reminding.\n\n(I know about ooc communication, no need to lecture me in the comments please.

            "selftext": "  This is a situation I had with a recent writing partner. She was super nice, we chatted ooc a little and she seemed interested in my search and eager to come up with a story together. \n\n   \n  My partner: So, I have a great idea, let's do a science-fiction roleplay. \n\nMe: Sorry, but I specified in my search that sci-fi isn't really my thing... \n\nMy partner: Oh, don't worry! In fact, there are only tiny science-fiction aspects, it is not like Star Wars, (continues to explain her idea). \n\nMe: Okay, we can maybe try to include some aspects of this. (it didn't sound that bad, not what I would normally write stuff like that but I figured that I could give it a try.) \n\nMy partner: Great! Our characters could be soulmates who have been separated many times, but now they find each other again. \n\nMe: Oh, my search says that I am not interested in a romance roleplay, I was looking for a non-romance roleplay specifically.   \n\nMy partner: No, you don't understand. It doesn't have to be a romance roleplay, we will see how well our characters will get along, I will not force it. Maybe they don't even like each other, who knows? \n\nMe: Okay, if you promise that you won't force it and are not disappointed if there is no romance between these characters...do you have any ideas for your character? \n\nMy partner: He is a police man who quit his job because of a traumatic event, and now he works as a private investigator. \n\nMe: Uhm, how old is he? My search specified that the age range of the characters should be 17-20. \n\nMy partner: I forgot about that. But how about this, the private investigator has a teenage son. So we both write one adult character, and one younger character. You wrote in your search that you like to write more than one character. \n\nMe: I am not really happy like this, but let's see if we can make it work. Okay, I guess...so, my adult character could be a criminal who been discriminated against all his life because he belongs to (fantasy race)... \n\nMy partner: I am sorry, he? This sound nice, but I would like you to write a female character. My adult character is a heterosexual man and he wouldn't have an other man as his soulmate, I don't write mxm, but if you could just change this little aspect it's fine. \n\nMe: (At this point, I take another look at my search, which also specified that in the rare case that I write romance, I only write mxm, and that I only want to write male characters for this roleplay. I decide that I should tell her that this won't work out, because now I have to: write in a sci-fi setting although I don't like sci-fi, write a roleplay that has focus romance even though I don't really like romance, have to write a woman as a main character even though I normally prefer to write men, and have to write characters in the wrong age range.)\n\n My partner: Well, your search said you were willing to compromise... \n\n  \n  Yes, I am willing to compromise when it comes to certain aspects (for example, if your character is 21 instead of 20, if you don't want to write more than one character, if you want to include some aspects which I have not mentioned in my prefences), but I am not willing to include NOTHING I was looking for in my roleplay. \n\nIt is especially frustrating if we have to get to the whole act of planning and then I have to find out that my partner likes none of the things I was looking for...",

            "selftext": "School has been extremely busy for me recently and when I do have some free times, I mostly just wanna play video games and clear my head, but I miss Roleplaying so much. I recently made a server for my Roleplaying friends where we could just do whatever, but I miss being part of a dedicated community, a well developed setting and chatting with people about our characters and ideas.\n\nI have tried making servers, I love running servers! But most of my current Roleplaying buddies never ever do anything, despite telling me that they're interested and want to help. I always end up being the one who has to pull all the load, even when I try and give my buddies pointers as to how they can help out, how to accept applications and how to react to trolls. They just always sit there and do nothing and I would be lying if I said it doesn't piss me off because it makes me not want to do anything and then my servers just end up getting abandoned, despite how much effort and thought I've put into them. It just sucks when you're excited for a setting and see your friend just sitting on it, saying they want to help out, but end up just picking at their belly buttons. Let's be real, running a roleplay alone is exhausting as fuck. \n\nI miss when everyone were excited about roleplay, when I could go to bed and be excited for the replies that my overseas friends would post for me while I slept. I can't even remember the last time that happened.\nAnd yes, I have thought about joining servers as a member, but every server I find is either full of kids, one liners and/or smut. I'm a 30 year old dude and my interest in erp doesn't exist. I'd like to get something out of my stories and not just, \"she smiled cutely at him with her kawaii face and sugoi eyes.\"\nAnd yes, I have thought about 1x1 rps as well, but I always end up ghosting those because I find it hard to get engaged in a story when only two people are involved. I like the thrill of multiple characters getting into a scene and even more so, getting excited and hyping over those scenes with different people.\n\nI'm not sure when this changed for me. Roleplay is like an old friend that I desperately want to keep in touch with, but our interests are just too different now. I wish I could go back and get excited over a setting and a community again or at least find someone who would run a server decently with me again.",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo this experience has been haunting me for quite some time. Apologies this is long, there is not an easy way to shorten it.\n\nTried to make my own roleplay group/server using a platform (with one friend helping me.). Sent a request for help because doing all the art alone is exhausting. Someone responded and I had met them before briefly. They had done this before, and are somewhat of a known presence.\n\nAccepted their help. They were nice at first. Seemed interested in the story.(boasted about how unique aspects of it were or something.) Suddenly the more planning we got to, the more they had a lot to say. While of course I found their criticism very valid, and we decided to follow their advice on set up. It seemed as though they were making attempts to change the story all together. It was disheartening to feel I had to keep removing my own ideas. We tried to compromise. When we would agree on something the next day they would press the issue further until I felt I had to just do what was asked. (My friend expressed displeasure because this kept happening while the person barely helped.) In the end the group was messy for many reasons, and we gave up on it.\n\nAfter that I helped them work on their own rp community/servers because I still wanted to continue trying RP in general, and I saw them as a friend. I started to notice that all those ideas I was talked out of were being placed in this person\u2019s story. A close example would be like me creating something called the \u2018sun realm\u2019 and theirs would be the \u2018day realm\u2019. The writing is very similar but some words \u2018remixed.\u2019 (I know people will at times have similar concepts. It just seemed weird how the wording was almost identical to mine, but I was told to get rid of my ideas beforehand.)\n\nI tried not to dwell on it. Helped them out. Collaborated with art and writing. Never received credit for doing so. They also would be wishy washy with me. Ghosting me until they needed something. Getting mad if I was busy. Being passive aggressive and dismissive if they were displeased. I left but said it as my real life was hectic and I could not help. I did not want to fight them because they often spoke poorly of those who they argued with. We seemed to part on okay terms. (They spoke of many confrontations they had with ex-friends.)\n\nWithin some time they removed me as a friend after acting out a few times to get me to speak to them. Come across another group. Feels oddly familiar. Realize it's a story I helped write. No credit to me of course. \n\nAnyway I have proof of all this (and more I believe). I have considered saying something about it. This experience has given me a lot of anxiety to the point I have considered quitting rp. People I have confided in say I should speak up, so this won\u2019t happen to other rpyers/writers/artists. I don\u2019t know though because I often see issues like these dismissed. Also I am kind of a nobody and I don\u2019t have any friends in this community.",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nThis seems to be a recurring theme that I've been finding from people I've met through some of the subreddits for roleplaying. \n\nI have a full time job, so I work 40+ hours a week. I'm on my feet through the majority of that time and I don't have a lot of time to check my phone for roleplay messages. I typically roleplay exclusively on discord, though I generally find partners on reddit, so I regularly check my reddit chats and DMs as well. \n\nAnyway, it's been a recurring theme that people don't quite understand that I'm a very busy person and there are some days that I can't post or don't have the mental faculties to post after my shift. I work retail, I deal with Karens all day, it's hard to find your muse after that, you know? So I've run in to a couple people that RP Star Wars specifically that get a little irate when I'm unavailable. I get it, you like the story, you want to roleplay it out and get whatever you want out of it. Sorry that I don't have the time to fulfil that need.\n\nToday though, I got a real kicker. I was called \"disrespectful\" because I have a life outside of RP and the Internet. I wasn't available for a few days (I worked long shifts, it was kind of a go to bed when you get home and get up and go straight to work kind of weekend). Apparently it's disrespectful to not let a person that you've known for about a week when you're not going to be available. I'm literally stunned. Do some people expect you to be available 24/7/365 at the drop of a hat for them and only them? I don't get it. I don't expect any of my roleplay partners - or even close friends - to be able to drop literally everything to have a conversation with me or roleplay with me. Does it make me an asshole to think that being called disrespectful for something so dumb?",

Fair enough, I\u2019ve always put forth the message that real life comes first. I figured we could wait until their schedule cleared up, or at the very least just end things on respectful terms. But when I tried to send them a message basically just saying \u201cNo worries, hope we can resume or start something new someday soon!\u201d I found out that they had blocked me. \n\nNow, does this mean that they were lying about not having enough time? Of course not. I don\u2019t know what their schedule is like, nor will I pretend to. But I have really bad anxiety and when an RP Partner blocks me out of the blue, I start thinking about all of the things I potentially did wrong. If I did do something wrong, I\u2019d much rather the other person tell me about it so I can work on avoiding it for future RP\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m probably just overreacting, but things like this really mess with my head.",

I've been RPing for about five years now, mostly 1x1 but I've since branched into group roleplays on discord when the pandemic hit and national lockdowns became the new norm. I've joined several groups but have only really found one that I liked and can see myself staying long term. \n\nNow I'm contemplating on starting my own group that combines the things I like to see a group RP and minimize the things that I can't really stand. I mostly joined fantasy based or fandom RP servers and mine will be along these lines as well. Below, I'll include a list of this for reference. I have quite a bit of spare time now with literally nothing much to do so taking on this project is sounding really appealing to me.\n\nBut my question is, for people who favor group rps, what're the things that you like in a server that will make you stay and what're the things that are immediate red flags for you? And for those who've tried their hand at running servers before, how was it like and any tips?\n\nThings I like to see in an RP server and will most likely include in mine:\n\n* concrete rules to follow and strict enforcement of them - in terms of OOC behavior\n* transparency and open communication between members and admins\n* narrative based, character driven, story focused RPs\n* well thought out systems and lore\n* literate RPs",

His age is over 20 years old. While I am fine to say if you have a fetish, it's okay to have it, DO NOT push it onto other people- characters included. He was doing this without anyone's awareness, but he does speak about feet a *lot.* Just because people aren't aware DOES NOT MEAN IT'S OKAY.  \n\n**J -** The main owner of the server and the person straight up letting shit happen in his server. Both of them have claimed my work as their own. Please be aware that this is not the case. I used to work under them, in a server where I made the proficiency system which took about two days. J was out of it because he was recovering from Corona, and FallenEclipse often mentions me trying to get him removed from staff because he never *did* anything within staff.  They deliberately blocked me, deleted the first server I was in which held most of the proof of them having no hand in the system, but other than that **I have the logs that show I am the only one who was ever on that doc.**  I don't want them to get away with anything like this ever again.\n\nThey are unoriginal thieves, and it sates me to know that they have to take my work and pass it off as their own to be able to form any kind of server. However, your own creativity and your own merit should be what you work for; not taking someone else's hard work. They believed they were entitled to it because it was in one of their servers.  They also stole my template at one point in time, although they have changed it. However, they are not letting go of my systems that easily.\n\nTo top it off, I received a ban with no explanation as to why I was banned, along with no warning whatsoever. They are absolutely currently claiming that these systems are theirs. I've reported them everywhere, but these people are **terrible.**",

            "selftext": "I am apologizing in advance since this ended up rant-y.\n\nSo I've been talking to this person for a 1x1 rp now. They're not familiar with the setting / fandom but since I've been itching for a roleplay like this in ages, I caved in and approached them. At first, things were going well. They made it clear that they're very new but interested in roleplaying this. I don't want to gatekeep so I explained as much as I can. \n\nAs time passed though, it became obvious that they're not keen on putting effort on googling things at all. When I asked them for a faceclaim, they said they don't know where to get it. I linked them various resources. When they uploaded their faceclaim, the image's quality was so low it's hard to recognize the model. I had to reverse image search to see it clearly. When I brought up some names and terms in the fandom, they didn't know what it was. I tried to understand because they did say they were new but is it really hard to use google? And it's not a very small fandom either so there's content in various websites, social media, and forums.\n\nWhat urged me to post this though is when posting our character profiles, theirs was so barebones there was too little to work with (as in aside from basics like name/age/height/etc, the only info is that their OC is biracial). When asked to share more info, they agreed but said said they will only post info that my OC knows. I don't metagame. It's one of the main rp rules. I'm just getting iffy now that they will suddenly do something that makes no sense for the setting and the fandom. What should I do?",

I don\u2019t come across a lot of people who don\u2019t mind this so getting messaged by one makes me excited to get started. \n\nThis guy responds to my post for a delinquent and good girl roleplay. (This was a fascination I had at the time) Basically my character is overall a nice person and has good grades. She\u2019s quiet if not spoken to, no real friends, and a bookworm. Now I know this can seem like a boring character but I had plans. Anyways he was a delinquent due to my request and it started fine. \n\nSo he starts us off in a cafe and this was the first red flag. He walks in with his friends and immediately notices my character sitting with her friends. He was already controlling my character by giving her friends even though my bio said she didn\u2019t really have any. I ignored it and because they were in collage I played it off like they were her roommates. \n\nHis character sends a coffee over to mine like what people do in bars, whatever that\u2019s fine. My character glances at him then goes back to looking out the window, day dreaming. His character walks over and strikes up a conversation. Totally normal right? Nope! He asks to speak with her alone. She hesitantly agrees. He leads her to another table and starts asking her all these personal questions. He was coming off very creepy. She got intimidated and left the cafe.\n\nHe stops the roleplay with one word \u201cno\u201d. I ask \u201cno what?\u201d His response \u201cno she doesn\u2019t leave.\u201d Me \u201cuh, yeah she does, she\u2019s freaked out.\u201d And he responds \u201cno she stays and continues the date.\u201d Me \u201cWhat date? He never asked her out he just dragged her away from her roommates.\u201d He kept arguing and I told him we weren\u2019t a good match for roleplay then he swore at me and I blocked him.\n\nI try so hard to make good characters, good roleplays but never seem to meet the right partners.

            "selftext": "TLDR: I left. \n\nSo update on the villains ganging up on my thing. [ https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/kbom01/op_villains_ganging_up_in_my_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ] I left. Since they wanted to off my character so badly they can do it. I\u2019m not going to deal with unfair bs. I should\u2019ve just offed her myself in spite by pounding her head continuously into the wall 150 times, cause that's how I felt reading through the bs. \n\n\n*{Info about my relationship with the group: I'm not sure if this checks out or not but they didn't like anime, I watch some anime and the people there made jokes that they bully them out...Also, fun fact I wasn\u2019t aware my character got hit with a painting until someone mentioned it in an ooc chat about how they laughed at my character getting hit with one.}*\n\n\nYou could stay and make a new character but it\u2019s in a way that\u2019s like \u201cOh your character died, oh well, churn out another character in 2-3 days or you gotta leave.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been in the RP and I see some people who already had TWO of their characters die and have to make another one. Like, imagine treating other people's characters as fucking punching bags, expecting them not to grow attached to them, and forcing them to create more characters only having them die 0.15 seconds later. This isn't a fucking slaughterhouse. How are you supposed to even enjoy the rp if you\u2019re dying more than living to see what happens? I don't want to hear the \u201dwell just avoid people and solo roleplay\u201d THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF ROLEPLAYING? It\u2019s going to be boring as hell just avoiding ANY character just so your character can remain in a lackluster story. \n\nI also don't wanna hear the \u201dwell you should be smarter with your choices.\u201d This isn't a survivor horror game where you can pick choices that can determine your fate. You're at the mercy of the creators of the rp, they decide everything and can rig it to however they like even if you made the \u201dsmarter\u201d choices. \n\nJigsaw from the Saw trilogy tells people what they need to do to get out of the traps. Sometimes, you don't even need to do EXACTLY what he says to get out. There are examples of characters that got out of traps not doing what they were told to do but were told *how* the mechanism works. This is how horror rps can thrive because it encourages creativity, as long as it's logical and realistic. Jigsaw did not withhold any information, he just designs the traps and tell people how they were supposed to be disarmed/activated. It\u2019s not like he will punish you. \n\nNow imagine if Jigsaw were to withhold information on how to get out of the traps or even tell you only have 60 seconds to get out. He just tells you \u201cyou\u2019ll die soon\u201d. Or if you\u2019re Amanda, you make the traps in a way the victim would die anyway even if they were told how to get out of it. \n\nThe creators here use the character\u2019s limited knowledge against them and that's not fair. The only reason I could see withholding info in horror genres is to have a \u201dvictim example\u201d character which is so shitty to do to a person\u2019s character and not make an npc. In this RP, every character is told the place is perfect. My character came into the place with that thought in mind and wasn\u2019t told otherwise. Ev took advantage of their limited knowledge and haven't bothered to tell her anything, not even a false explanation, they wanted to get a cheap kill from her and that's why I was so pissed about what went down.\n\nThe good guys get rekt and are treated as punching bags, villains God mod, metagame, and have the most kill count so that they can show how DOMINATE they are in the roleplay. Anyone neutral purposefully roleplay with each other to be safe or (force to) join the bad guys so they won't die faster. \n\nThe characters I made were made with effort and each of them being valuable, not disposable trash. Because of this experience, I will NEVER join any \u201dsurvival horror\u201d roleplay ever again.",

Get someone who at first asks if they could be the female (note it said MxF in the post AND I said my OC is male). After moving to Discord, sharing my bio they then send theirs. I didn't read all of it because the picture was some faceclaim of a actor, and if you don't know...Night in the Woods had anthropomorphic characters (not a furry thing, just how it is). Before hand I asked if they knew this was a roleplay in the NITW universe and they said yes. I probably should've read the whole bio, but as I closed out of the DM just out of frustration (that was my fault admittedly) but I did some digging I found out they were underage (18+ is something I also specified AND asked them if they were which they said yes to.) Is this just a thing in the RP community where people just skim the ads? I'm putting this down as my fault because I felt like I wasn't clear enough and I should've just checked their social media before hand to confirm if they were 18 or not.",

If they do I just want a safe space to vent anonymously because I don\u2019t want shit to happen in the ooc. So I want to censor this post as much as possible. Horror rp. So the horror aspect aside it had a pretty solid storyline. A perfect place turns out to be a dystopia once people learn about it. The character I made went there to see it and find the person who runs it if they know her origins. She thinks she\u2019s human but she\u2019s another race. \n\nSo in the rp you start outside or in a room. I saw that there was a fight going down between (who I will call Ev and Gp). I honestly did not want to go into that so I thought there would be another path to take. Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t so I just went in. My character (like all characters that come in this dystopia) is oblivious to what goes on. My character thought it was a sparring match but she did have suspicious lt wasn't. She meets Ev who is the owner of the place. Gp was the same/similar race to my character. She can feel something when she's near them. She asked if she can go to the library or a meeting room and Ev was saying they can go to the meeting room to talk. During the walk, she explains how she came here about her origins. Ev suddenly asks \u201dare you [insert actual race]?\u201d She is confused because she doesn't know so she said she wasn't.\n\nEv whispers to Gp that if they talk they will kill them. So they go to the meeting room. Ev wants them to heal Gp. She agreed to it. When she was observing Gp\u2019s wounds she asked the other man did they wanted her to also make some tea for them since they were both injured. Here comes when EVERYTHING escalated. \n\nEv seems to know what race they truly are but my character doesn't when she told them that they weren't what they asked her. It seems that they were expecting her to pull out healing magic because she was of a certain race. Then all of a sudden got mad, pushed her out the way- mind you I haven't even had my character having a post attempting to heal Gp she was just asking if they also wanted tea! Of course they didn\u2019t know where the kitchen was so I was expecting to get a post referring to that. What's more than in the same post of Ev he traps her with binding [insert element] magic , heals Gp,  (I don\u2019t think healing people was in their character sheet). gives Gp a sword and says \u201dI accept everyone here but she's worthless, kill her.\u201d \n\nThis first thing was a red flag for me. This post was completely rushed and I was confused. They didn\u2019t let me try to heal him..\n\nMy character was confused and I was very confused. I unfortunately still had to RP this like she was still confused because again she didn\u2019t know what this place was. She uses powers that are weak to Ev and she slips out. She demands a 1v1 with the knight. If she wins she can prove her worth, if she loses she accepts her fate. And it wasn\u2019t like she could run out of the door at the time. \n\n They were reluctant to fight me but they wanted my character to escape. Gp would then hit my character hard and send her flying to the door. Before all of that he whispered to her to get out of there. She still didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on but decided to now leave cause everything was getting crazy. Ev would block all the possible exits with his powers. My character would use a heavy hitting attack to break the magic and the door. At first I was going to have her stay and fight and think of some way out for both of them but that would be wishful thinking.\n\nShe manages to break out again but ONLY JUST ANOTHER POST IN FROM SOMEONE ELSE. They were coming into the establishment. They saw my character who was getting out of the room. They saw her, glance at the people who were in the room, grabbed a painting, smacked her with it and the impact made her go BACK into the room. All in one post btw. And the reasoning for this? Well, this person was a servant for Ev and magically assumed what went down in the room even though he wasn't there to know what happend. \n\n On the outside I was cool with this but on the inside I was irked but Ev had telepathic powers? Idk but it wasn't in their character sheet. And if it was you have to admit it's a broken ability. These people were in separate places, the servant hasn't met my character AT ALL. And magically assume she was a problem? \n\nAt this point, I'm convinced that they are desperate to kill off my character and weren't letting her get any chance to leave out of the room. Even going as far as to do things that weren't in their characters sheets. What's worse is Ev is the creator of this group. And what caused all of this to transpire? BECAUSE MY CHARACTER DIDNT HAVE HEALING POWERS. \n\nI honestly don't know what's funnier? How fast things escalated or that the bad guys were tag teaming my character conveniently. What if She tried to escape again? What\u2019s next? Another servant comes in, instantly knows what\u2019s going on and chops off my character\u2019s leg and sends me back into the room? More hilarious is that if you were to convert these posts into rp time, then it would\u2019ve been only 15 minutes since she came into the rp. That\u2019s gotta be a world record for the fastest character going to die in the rp! My character getting horror movies casts a run for their money! \n\nI don't know what to do. As of writing this They aren\u2019t dead, but they have sustained many servers injuries. Some of her abilities are on a cool down so it\u2019s going to be hard to put up a fight. I made this post long enough. I will post an update on it if people are interested.",

            "selftext": "So awhile ago I put out an ad on Reddit for a 1x1 RP via Discord, the RP was a pretty hard sell considering it was set in the land of Oz (as in The Wizard of Oz), I accepted the fact that most people wouldn't be into it because it's not that popular and honestly pretty niche. Anyways, I found someone that was really interested and we hit it off pretty well! So I'm thinking \"Great! This person gets what the story is about and knows what's up!\"\n\nWhen in fact it was I that DIDN'T know what was up. \n\nWe move to Discord and I have a server all set up and pretty with a detailed lore, characters (I was the GM so I'd be in charge of the big players and a few small side characters) a breakdown of races and magic hell in even had a small bestiary! So I was fucking READY! So we start talking about character creation and this person started hinting that they wanted to play as someone from the ice age (Neanderthal or something similar) and I was slightly confused, because \"How in the hell would that work?\"\n\nThey proceeded to tell me how they thought the lore should be changed to make The Witches Femdoms and Futas, because \"that would terrify a caveman\". I stood my ground and said \"Lol no that's not gonna happen. I created the lore specifically the way I did for a reason.\" Partner then agrees and says \"well how bout I play as a girl from more modern times?\" I say that's great! Now we're getting somewhere!\n\nSo they post their character and surprisingly it was cohesive and seemed to fit the RP and the general feel of what I was going for. \"AWESOME! A little bump in the road but no worries! I got a partner and I'm gonna enjoy this!\" So we talk about starting the RP (Honestly I think this is where I went wrong, I'm terrible at writing starts and should really work on that) Partner asks if they can start, I say \"Sure! That'll give us a good base if you wanna start in the real world.\"\n\nPartner then writes for a solid ten minutes before a massive wall of text appears. Their starter was something you would find in the depths of Fanfic websites. Like the very last page that no one ever goes through, hidden among the mildly sexual and blatantly disrespectful of source material Fanfics. This starter had everything I didn't want. Their OC had been kidnapped by The Wicked Witch of the West and was being held captive in a \"pleasure dungeon\", there were tentacles involved, inflation and conversations between the two characters.\n\nMind you this is the fucking starter! I hadn't even begun to write. This person had hijacked my fucking story, lore and characters, turned it into some twisted sexual fantasy (mind you I'm totally cool with smut and whatever kinks people are into, very sex positive here) BUT to try and turn something that wasn't supposed to be smutty and sexual; and then twist it into something they wanted to write was unforgivable.\n\nI told them I was no longer interested in writing with them, they needed to go to DDP or some other NSFW subreddit if they wanted to do that. I got bitched out, called a few choice words and accused of being a prude that didn't appreciate the art of their writing and interpretation of my lore.\n\nSo I kicked them, blocked them and had a beer while I thought about my life choices.\n\nWhy does this happen and how do you deal with it?",
