I was certain I\u2019d stopped earlier than that!\n\nIn RPs I always everything so overdramatic and dumb and really dark and did that cringey fucking stuttering thing where half of every sentence was just \u2018-\u2018s and everything was overtly sexual and all in all it was just ridiculous and terrible.\n\nI don\u2019t roleplay at all anymore, and would certainly never roleplay as real people again, but I feel bad about having done it in the first place.\n\nThis is more a confession than a story really, but I felt the need to sort of get it off my chest so I can stop thinking about and cringing about it!",

            "selftext": "So I run a discord rp server with a custom lore that most everyone has no problem with abiding by. It's a normal afternoon, me and my writers are discussing future events, then bam. Here comes this person I'll call Canine (not her real name/tag). Canine reads up on the rp, and one of her first interactions is to send an image of her getting her character denied in another, unrelated server in the vent channel. Basically she didnt comply with the application rules, and Canine kept saying she was being \"Creatively restricted\". I had an 11 hour flight to take, so I ignored it for now and got on. I land the next morning, and there's a conversation going on in an rp planning channel.\nIt's nice conversation about our characters, until I see one message from canine. She states that anyone meeting her char will be met with a language barrier.\nThis catches my eye because I've established in the lore that there is a single unified language everyone speaks in that world. There's a long winding list of irp reasons for it that I won't get into. Now Canine goes on a rampage, saying I'm \"CrEaTiVeLy ReStRiCtInG\" her. Even after giving her several lore reasons about it, she \"doesn't care\" and people \"invent new languages\". \n\nNow all upon that she acts like she's some kind of genius who has discovered some halting plothole in my lore. She keeps saying \"I don't care\" over and over again at my every argument. In the end, I said \"Don't care about this then\" and banned her. It's nightmare rpers like this that make it hard to run a server sometimes. The lens that think it's my job to cater to their creative needs.\n/end rant",

Feel free to correct me) I looked to rp as Superheroes/villains.\n This particular day I was an alternative version of Loki. I was feeling fluffy and feral so I went for a child, frost giant version of him. Had a few on and off but nothing memorable until I found a Thor. I was pretty excited because hey! This could be fun! Sent a small lil starter and this is where things went bad. \n\nIt started out pretty normal, a few replies back and forth. Until Thor decided he didn't want to rp with my version of lil Loki and took the bull by the horns to steer it in another direction entirely. So, lil Loki is dragged to a room in his lil ice castle where his grown up body was asleep on a slab. Thor then went on to tell lil Loki that he was being tricked, that the adult Asgardian body was his, how he lost his memory and all that. \nI probably should've disconnected at that bc I was not looking for that but figured it could at least be a bit of interesting rp.\nSo my character, being a child, starts yelling and screaming about how Thor is a liar, etc. Etc. But Thor just decides to ignore it and cast some sort of ritual to put my character's mind inside the sleeping adult Loki's body?? Still following? \n\nMy character, being a version that's again, a child and frost giant, starts freaking tf out. Obviously. Crying and screaming at Thor even more. Thor then goes about how he loves Loki (romantically. I don't tend to judge ships, whatever gets your rocks off. But it ain't my thing)  and then proceeds to UNALIVE HIMSELF to be with the \"real Loki\" and roleplays himself in, Valhalla or smth??? embracing Adult Loki and leaves it at that for me to reply to.\n\nAt this point it's gone off the handle so I decide to message Thor OOC to basically tell him, I had no idea where to take this rp now that Thor is dead. Thor replies by telling me that I should've played adult Loki, should've thrown them a bone, how they just wanted to rp with Adult Loki. I replied if I wanted to rp as Adult Loki that I would've had that in the title of my name. That it wasn't okay for them to try and force me to be smth i didn't want to be, and especially without asking me OOC first. \n\nThey start trying to guilt trip me at this point about how \"No one ever wants to rp with me\" and how \"I just want to rp my ship but everyone always disconnects\" I don't take it, bc screw that. Just basically tell them to keep looking, they'll eventually find someone, but I'm not that someone bc I neither ship that ship nor do I want to be that particular version of Loki. They disconnected. I shrugged and continued with my life. \n\nA pretty boring ending but that rp still pops into my head years later so I figured I'd share it. I have more stories abt characters unaliving themselves bc my character refuses to bend to the way they think said character should be played.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I made an alt account for this rant because I don't want anyone I rp with to feel called out but holy shit. I just don't get why people won't say they aren't comfortable rping with trans people?? Like, I have a lot of trans characters -- including a few who are nonbinary. Whenever I plan to use one of those characters, I always check with the prospective partner. I've now had two people tell me it's totally chill -- and then continue to belligerently misgender my characters over and over. Like, you'll look like less of a transphobe if you just say no in the first place??? For example, one of my nonbinary characters ofc uses gender-neutral terms of address (i.e. person, child, parent, partner, etc.) and I explained this to one partner and their response was literally \"Okay, well I'm probably going to keep messing that up.\" What the hell? I don't want to have to educate people on trans issues in the first place, but I sure as hell don't want to fight against my character getting misgendered at every turn. If you're not comfortable with rping with trans characters, just say so!!!! If you're looking to learn and are open minded, understand that it can be exhausting for trans creators to have to educate you, but there are plenty of people who are willing and happy. But for all that's good in the world, if someone asks you if you are okay with their character being trans and you know you'll misgender them constantly, just. say. no. and move on.",

            "selftext": "A recent thread here debated whether or not it's okay to plant requests in your roleplay ad for people who contact you to say specific things that prove they read the whole ad.  I have a slightly different pet peeve, but the comment thread reminded me of it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy problem right now is people who want something very specific and take 1000 words of ad to get to it, thus wasting a chunk of my time.  For example, let's say you're a female rper who likes longer posts but is less picky about platform, who only want to roleplay with male rpers who play dark-haired brooding vampires.  That's specific without being super uncommon or weird.  Logically your ad should say something like: \n\n&amp;nbsp:\n\n**24F4M 18+(Discord)(Email)(Gdocs) ADVANCED LIT looking for vampire stories!**\n\n*Hello!  I'm CuteNickname!  I'm looking for someone who like playing a dark-haired, brooding type, and I really strongly prefer vampires or vampire-like characters.  I'm hoping for \nsomeone who can send me a few paragraphs every day to every other day, and I can definitely post that often.  I would also prefer the vampire be only from either gaslamp fantasy, like the original Dracula, or at least a modern vampire who is old enough to be from that era.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInstead, CuteNickname's ad starts like this:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**\n**24F4A 18+(Discord)(Email)(Gdocs) ADVANCED LITERATE LONG-TERM RP**\n\n*Hi, I'm Cutenickname.  I'm a Pisces with an Aquarius rising sign who has a theme song and Pinterest board for every one of my characters including extensive faceclaims!  I'm 24 and I  work as a freelance cost accountant, so I can post pretty often, except when I have work!  I'd like to do a longer-term roleplay with someone who won't just ghost me after a few posts like keeps happening.  I can write and spell well, and I would like a partner who can, too.  I'm not trying to be super mean, that's just what I'm into, ya know? ;)   I'm in the Eastern Standard Timezone.  I'd like a roleplay that doesn't dive directly into smut, but instead let the characters get to know each other gradually.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd on like that for a long time.  It's only *after* you get through the things many roleplayers want (gradual, realistic romance, readable writing, partners that don't ghost, friendly ooc chat) that you get to a final section that says:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*I'm looking to play with THESE characters, or characters like them!* Or possibly, *I'd like to play with these canons from these shows!* followed by a list of characters who all fit the exact type they want without them ever directly admitting to having a type.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSay what you want up front.  Don't waffle around for ten paragraphs avoiding saying you want your OC to boff Castiel from Supernatural or you want to do a Batman/Superman slash or you're into GMing realistic historical dramas in the Black Death era or whatever the very specific crave is.  And especially don't put up an ad suggesting you might negotiate many kinds of story when you still plan to try and guide any random roleplayer back toward the same shortlist of cravings.  I can't help feeling that a lot of people wouldn't need to ghost the unsuspecting if they would admit what they want, explain to other people what they want, and hold out directly and honestly for that thing from the title of the ad on.",

            "selftext": "This is not a story about someone I personally had a roleplay with, it is something I witnessed in multiple roleplay groups on facebook.\n\nLet's call the girl Sandy. In the beginning, I frequently saw searches which Sandy had written. It was always some pretty generic stuff, your character had to be a policeman/firefigher/ lawyer and was the love interest of some random girl (her character). There wasn't much information given besides that, just that it should have some erotic elements.\n\nI am not interested in romance in general, but even if I was the searches didn't seem very appealing because they were so short. Most of the time, one or two people would reply that they were interested. So nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWell, until Sandy wrote a comment under a different roleplay search. It was something along the lines of 'why don't you write something in our roleplay instead?' The person who posted the search replied that he had already told her that he did not want to write with her anymore, because she constantly asked him to reply even if he was unavailable and got angry if that wasn't possible. Soon enough, I read similiar stories about her behavior.\n\nThere weren't many people interested in her searches to begin with, and with her behavior she seemed to loose the people who were most of the time.\n\nSo, Sandy developed a new 'strategy'. If someone searched a male character as a love interest in a story, she would 'Hey, I am interested. but I will be the girl.'\n\nOf course, that didn't went well, and people replied that the search was specifically looking for a male character, so they could write the female role. The conversations went like this:\n\nInnocent person: 'Oh, sorry, I am only looking for someone who can write a male character. Good luck with your search!'\n\nSandy: 'But I want to write the girl.'\n\nInnocent person: 'But I am not looking for someone who will write the girl.'\n\nSandy: 'That is so unfair. You should be nice and let me write the girl for once.'\n\nThis would go on forever, until the person who posted the search got tired and ignored her.\n\nSo, as one might expect, Sandy had a bad reputation on many of these roleplaying sites. \n\nWhat happened next left me speechless. She would post vague comments about being bullied. So, I get that a lot of people having a negative opinion about you can feel like bullying to some people (even if your behavior was the cause of that.) But that wasn't what she meant. She thought that it was bullying:\n\n\\-that nobody wanted to let her write the female character even if the search she replied to specified that these people weren't looking for the female character\n\n\\-she thought that it was bullying that many people prefered romance stories with a detailed plot and not her 'I am looking for a fire fighter as a love interest for my female character.' searches\n\n\\-and last but not least, she thought that the mods should FORCE at least some members of the group  to roleplay with her, because otherwise, it was bullying, because it was unfair that she had trouble finding someone. Therefore, if people wanted to stop this horrible 'bullying', they had to write with her, whether they found her ideas appealing or not. Or they were monsters who condoned the bullying of a young girl...\n\nYeah, you can probably imagine how the mods reacted. In some groups, I saw that she was removed, in others, she is still present but only allowed to post her searches. I doubt that she ever changed her behavior or realized that she was the one who was annoying and wrong.",

            "selftext": "This is honestly the cutest thing in the world.\n\nImagine a Hamilton role play like this, fellas. Full of OCS and canon characters. It\u2019s a fun little ditty about revolution and romance. What could go wrong?\n\nA lot.\n\nI\u2019m playing my oc against their oc. We play plenty of characters out side of that, but our main characters are pretty solid.\n\nThis is what happened. My character is a pretty rude hypocritical bastard. The words he says is not really kind, and he comes off as insanely rude and cruel because he simply wants to do everything in his power to maintain his authority and power. He wants to be strong and powerful.\n\nOkay. So when he pretty much does some hypocritical actions, he gets the appropriate response. People don\u2019t like him and don\u2019t like his attitude. Many people call him out for it, many people don\u2019t like him, and some of his allies are a bit wary of him but they still like him regardless.\n\nOkay, so far so good. That\u2019s the sort of react I\u2019m looking for. But then it gets weird.\n\nAll of a sudden, my partner\u2019s oc (who he hurt btw), suddenly blackmails the guy and makes him reveal things that could destroy him in the long run. She then proceeds to beat the shit out of the guy, and do many other cold and cruel hearted things to him, thinking she\u2019s the best and she\u2019s better than him. He\u2019s left broken and sad, and she pretty much laughs at him and doesn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nOkay...? I guess? It doesn\u2019t end there. She then had the dude wasting his time running errands for her and pretty much belittling him as a result, as a \u201ctake that you dick\u201d move to him. He reasonably didn\u2019t want to do that anymore, and when he told her that, she pretty much insulted and bashed him.\n\nOkay, whatever. That happens. He\u2019s not a friendly character, she felt insulted by him. I guess it works.\n\nNow it gets worse. The same damn people who insulted and raged at my character for saying cold hearted things, and tried to pretty much oust him from the story, are the SAME people who essentially flocking to my partners secondary character.\n\nFor context, we role play different people, multiple people.\n\nMy partners next character pretty much said the same awful shit about some soldiers who lost their lives in the war, and instead of having several heart palpitations and strokes like they did with my character who said that shit, they\u2019re flocking and revering to this asshole.\n\nThey\u2019re saying shit like \u201caww he must be hurt\u201d or \u201caww he\u2019s gotta be angry\u201d or \u201caww we need to see it his way for a minute\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t want to do that with my character who said some choice words about the war casualties? \n\nMy character literally said \u201cthose guys deserved to die since they were weak and unfit to serve.\u201d\n\nEveryone my partners character controls suddenly goes: RRRRRRaGGGHHHH!\n\nThis guy \u201cthose soldiers deserved to die because they were selfish and attention seeking!\u201d\n\nEveryone their character controls: \u201caww let\u2019s listen to them, maybe they\u2019re scared and sad and lonely\u201d \n\nLook. I get what my character said was some stupid shit, I get it. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t. I know he said some awful things, but I\u2019m not making him for perfection and goodness.\n\nWhat I\u2019m really mad at is the fact that my partners character could do the same exact thing my character did, and essentially have a lot of people either listening to him, fawning to him, crying for him, or wanting everyone to \u201chear him out\u201d.\n\nThey essentially called my character a \u201cdramatic bastard\u201d because he said a bunch of soldiers were weak because they couldn\u2019t stand to the challenges of war. They misrepresented what he said, and as a result, he was the demon child of the world and deserved ZERO respect or anyone to listen to him.\n\nBut this new guy who acts EXACTLY like my character pretty much gets all these asskissers and these people begging for the world to listen to him. \n\nWhat the actual hell? \n\nessentially my partner destroyed and ruined my character for being a \u201cweak and dramatic bastard\u201d but this SAME dude who acts the SAME way to the character she didn\u2019t like suddenly gets attention and appraised and that he\u2019s not some dramatic bastard?\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nI was about to do a whole ass redeemption arc for my character, but now I\u2019m just thinking he won\u2019t be doing that at all. It seems like it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway since people already decided they hate his guts but absolutely love and adore the same dude who said soldiers were weak and attention seeking.\n\nWhat I\u2019m thinking is that my character will just privately make his dues to society, but won\u2019t be begging for them to take him back. I dunno. I\u2019m just pissed off and I really don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy partner is pretty much afraid of confrontation. I really want to save this story somehow.\n\nIs there a subtle way I can get her to realize the hypocrisy without her getting all flustered and sad about it?",

            "selftext": "Decided to write with this dude and do this slice-of-life age gap plot. The older woman, the younger man. A tad unconventional, romantic, artistic, it was supposed to be this whole thing and, based on what he presented to me in terms of a character, everything seemed to check out. We discussed our characters briefly, plotted, and decided to hop right into roleplay. \n\nHis character was a painter, so the first scene was set during an art exhibition where his and my character were supposed to meet, yadda yadda. My first severe annoyance was that this dude decided to add some unnecessary drama into the plot via some old woman who comes up and asks his character if my character is his mother. \n\nNot a cliche at all, man. \n\nThis irritated me because no person in their right mind would ever confuse the two as mother and son. It's not as if he chose a babyfaced face claim, they don't look anything remotely alike, so why add that distinct element into this type of plot if not just to stir the pot with unnecessary drama? Whatever, I got past it. Mind you, he had said *nothing* up until this point about our writing styles not meshing. Not one thing. In fact, he did quite the opposite.  \n\n\nAt one point, he had asked me ooc if I will be around as he wanted to get some \"serious writing done\", I said yes, I just have to run some errands. Okay cool. So then why on God's green earth, keeping in mind that I told you that I have to get some shit done, do you come at me a couple of hours later talking about 'You there?' in our ooc thread.\n\nI don't know about you guys, but that is one of the things that *quickly* works to piss me off. Don't press me for replies. Don't nudge me with shit like that. I understand if it's been a few days and someone wants to check in, but a *couple of hours?* Nah man. It doesn't work like that. \n\nI don't respond to that message; ultimately I reply back to our oc thread and admittedly, yes it's a bit of a shorter reply, mostly because of my irritation at being prodded ooc. But it's not like I just gave three sentences out of spite, it was still a decently-sized response. \n\nThis dude comes back with now telling me, after a few days, that he \"doesn't know if our writing styles will mesh well\". Oh? Interesting, it's very coincidental that you are telling me this now after I didn't respond to your prodding ooc message. Honestly man, I can't with shit like this. Don't rush people, \"being around all day\" doesn't mean being glued to my laptop/phone 24/7 and responding as soon as you send your post. I'm just irritated, by both the ic and ooc interaction.",

(She of course has a good character too). I had plans for that crow, you know and so somehow the villain found it by the satellite and blew it up... I mean, really? No warning, no \"hey, do you have a plan for this pet or can I destroy it?\", just hacked it and sent it to death...\n\nHer reply was well written, she is a good writer but... that was my crow :c and had several interaction scenes already planned in my mind for him and my main character :c and then without any warning he is taken from me. Idk how you guys rp but I always ask my cousin before I do something drastic to her characters.\n\nAt first I was disbelieving, then sad, then angry and that situation just was a problem for the both of us.\n\nIn the end I retconed it by Morphy sending a false info virus for the villain and I'm sure my cousin won't do something like that after what we discussed.\n\nSo the moral is: don't kill off someone's else character (pet) without any warning or permission c:",

If I'm not feeling an RP I just say so and graciously drop, even if it hasn't been long. But I think this community worries \\*far\\* too much about ghosting.   \n\n\nFirst off, if you were still in initial talks, you didn't get ghosted. Someone does not owe you contact after two or three days of barebones planning, and usually even less. Most of us get lots of messages, and it should be perfectly acceptable to just...not respond to messages if you aren't interested in them.   \n\n\nSecond off, no random internet stranger owes you anything. Most of us have had quite a bit of blowback over ending an RP, and for that reason it's understandable when people just stop responding. Everyone says they'll be fine if their partner just ends the RP, but the reality is too many people aren't actually going to be 'just fine' with it. It's rude to do it if the RP has been going on a long time yeah, but if you're within the first two-three posts I seriously just assume that it was their issue and not mine and I let it go.  \n\n\nThird off, harassing your partners constantly because you worry they're ghosting you *is going to get you ghosted.* Personally I end RPs with people that poke me many times a day. Most of us are adults, we have lives. This is a hobby, it's not work.   \n\n\nIf you're getting ghosted a lot you maybe need to look into what you're doing--are you saying 'hey what's up' a few times a day in a 'hey I want you to post but not really' type way? Are you actively asking people when they are going to post when they might be or you know they are busy? If so yeah, it's probable you're gonna get ghosted by some people.  \n\n\nFinally, chemistry has a lot to play into this. Sometimes people just don't mesh. It's expected you will go through many partners before you find one you mesh with.  \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for coming to my tedtalk.",

            "selftext": "G'day,\n\nThis isn't an rp horror story or anything, just an unfortunate experience I had with one of my concept. This was back when I rped on Amino, because I had absolutely no sense of self preservation. \n\nOne of my plots involved a romance between a magician/alchemist and his assistant. My character's line of work was extremely dangerous, constantly involving curses and explosions and creepy beasties. I tried to make that abundantly clear in my ad. \n\nI have this peep message me, saying they like the idea. We introduced characters and kicked it off. Things didn't start off well. \n\nMy alchemist boy was pretty rich, with his own big mansion and a huge staff and basically a self sustained house. I stated that in the description of the character. He was just looking for an assistant in his studies. However, pretty servant boi comes into the study, with breakfast in hand, that he made by himself. Ok.\n\nI had my character kindly inform pretty servant boi that they have cooks that account for every food-related need of him and his staff. Servant boi does a droopy face, but then asks if he could assist alchemist boi in any way. \n\nYes he can. Air out the room, sweep the floor, grind up some herbs in the next hour. Simple, easy. But apparently no, because servant boi manages that in two hours, but feels the need to \"use his powers\" to finish his task. \n\nPowers??? We had no talk of powers in this household. The only mystical thing here was dragons and science. But since we didn't discuss the worldbuilding before that - sure, fine whatever. But, according to servant boi's writer - my alchemist boi had already eaten some of the food? Which I had no mention of in any of my posts. Just. Like. That. \n\nBut I'm a doormat, so we kept going, and here's where it gets meaty. Alchemist boi sets up the setting for a ritual to banish a curse from a hairpin, and tell servant boi \"follow my orders. If I say duck - you duck and think later. Now I need you to stay away from this thing, because its potentially dangerous.\"\n\nServant boi proceeds to stick to alchemist boi for the entirety or the ritual, peeking out from over his shoulder asking if he's ok or if the ritual is over yet. So the consequences, of course, are an explosion. I tried to go for a classic - serious professional protects newbie and things get a little warm and fuzzy. Servant boi gets a cut on the forehead and alchemist boi decides to patch him up. \n\nNow I've been calling them bois, but both of the characters are full on adults. Which is interesting, because servant boi starts crying. Naturally, my boi inquires if the other had read the job application and seen the word \"dangerous\" on there. And servant boi is suddenly all gloomy, going into an inner monologue about how his mother is ill and needs the money, so he decided to take up just any job that he could. But pity points aren't currency, so alchemist boi sends him to rest off, as he works alone for the rest of the day. \n\nAND SERVANT BOI HAS THE BEST AND WORST LINE OF INNER MONOLOGUE\n\nBoi wrote \"he walked away, holding back tears. He felt like he wasn't wanted there. The way his father always made him feel\" I'm sorry what?!\n\nI'm all up for issues with parents and a bit of cowardice, but... It just sounds like you're trying to make me feel guilty because my character did a rational thing. It's like if a dude applied to be a surgeon without any training, and acting all sad because \"the other doctors were just like bullies in his primary school.\" Sad, but it doesn't change a thing. So I broke it off, as politely as I could, and cherished this memory ever since.",

            "selftext": "I know why and where this can be a touchy subject, but I'm currently interested in a very kid pandering fandom and thinking about making a server of that fandom. It's targeted at kids and I have no issues letting kids/teenagers be part of my server as long as they can form coherent sentences and know how to roleplay. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to allow smut content on this server, at all, not even behind a hidden role. It's mainly because I have no interest in ERP and I quite frankly don't care for it, but also because I don't want members to bring their smut talk into other channels because \"they forgot that there are kids on the server\" (I've seen that happen before.)\n\nBut, my main question here is, if we allow kids to be part of our server, should we allow underaged characters as well? Should adult people be allowed to play underaged characters? I feel kinda iffy even writing that out, but then again, there are plenty adult writers out there who write books from the perspective of kids. As long as nothing illicit is going on and you keep the writing PG, is it still an issue to see adults in or near their thirties Roleplaying kid (teenagers) characters?\n\nI also feel like I need to clarify that obviously when I say \"kid characters\" I'm not speaking of little kids, but rather about teens since the age limit on Discord is 13 and I would like to keep members and characters above this age. I should probably also clarify that kid characters would need as much purpose and personality as any other character on the server and adults wouldn't just be playing such a character for a fantasy or fetish. It's about creative freedom in my eyes and taking the writers who write books about kids into account again, I have a hard time seeing how it could be illigal or wrong, though I know there's a fine line between keeping it like that and crossing into weirdo land.\n\nSo I want to know, what's the general consensus on adults writing teenagers in roleplay when no smut is allowed and it's a roleplay that caters to a safe environment for actual teenagers? Feel free to roast me, but please keep in mind that I genuinely don't know how to feel about this subject and that's why I'm making this post.",

Normally that's all fine and dandy, people deserve to be specific on likes and dislikes, but there's a point where you list so many \"no\" options you make it super hard to think of anything that might be accepted. Especially because there was NO \"yes\" list to help.\n\nIt was like seeing an ad for a high fantasy game and when you go into character creation, you find out there's no elves, gnomes, dragons, zombies, horned creatures, anything fish like, and no flying/winged creatures. So... what's left after that?\n\nYeah, you can scratch your head and find something that works around those rules, but you're taking out a good chunk of choice and as a result, making it that much harder on the partner to work in a concept to please you, as they probably lose any on hand characters and bend over backwards to follow your rules, since according to this very subreddit, if you ignore the preferences given and try to force your way around those rules, then you're an asshole and why did you even answer the ad?? (Not intending to sound snarky at all, it's just a very common issue I'm finding as a scroll through stories.)\n\nAt that point, instead of a bunch of hard or soft \"no's\", why not include some \"yeses\" too? Help us help you. I can much more readily accommodate a list where it gives me, \"you can be xx, yy, zz, aa, or dd,\" or even gives me subcategories of \"you can play an undead if you're a lich, not a zombie\" or \"you can be an avian as long as you aren't [species of bird] or [carbon copy of D&amp;D race]\" and things like that.\n\nMaybe that's just me though? I know it's a dumb issue to be bothered with, but to me, few things make me walk away faster than a bunch of restrictions with no indicator how to get approved; I'm not risking my free time playing 20 characters to appease you if you don't tell me what you DO want!",

People just don\u2019t want to play against black or non-white characters or have love interests that aren\u2019t skinny white women or a conventionally attractive white man. Hell, people will play with aliens and monsters sooner than with a nonwhite character. I get that everyone has preferences, but it\u2019s extremely discouraging when I make a character I like very much and get ghosted or told to try making another since they don\u2019t like my character. This never happens when I use a white character. \n\nI\u2019d really like to hear other people\u2019s thoughts on this. I think this has been a problem for a very long time in all niches of roleplay. I primarily roleplay MxM, and I notice that this is especially prevalent in that community.",

We don't want to make a connection or tell you about our personal lives or see what you look like or give you pictures to prove we're not catfish or see your penis. It's frustrating when you set clear boundaries and they still \" accidentally\" send you pictures or ask you personal questions or where you are and try to act nice and get too close cause they \" want a connection\" and get offended if you want to keep professional or something. \n\nThey don't get that girls gotta be safe on the internet and that we genuinely don't want to be their e-girlfriend or talk about our personal lives. Message me right off the bat with a lewd picture? Blocked. Ask me my location? It's over. And yet they want to be forgiven and continue after even though they were warned beforehand. \n\nWhy are they so desperate and aggressive and think it'll work? Why do they think that women into sexual stuff must be desperate for attention and a boyfriend? It's so annoying and while I understand a bit, I just wish that guys can behave and realize it'll work better for them if they don't cross the line?",
