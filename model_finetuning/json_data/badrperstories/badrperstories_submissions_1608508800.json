I thought it was worth a shot and agreed to start the process. I made a character and then the wait started. They told me that they would be busy but could get a character up within the next few days. Well a week has come and gone with them saying that they are \"super busy\". I understand real life comes first and it's the holidays, usually I have no problem waiting. Though when I can see that they are chilling in a discord server all day (that they found me on) and are making no efforts to start the rp or really communicate. I get a little annoyed. Why even waste both of our time if you really are THAT busy? I get that they don't owe me anything but I don't get their end game. \n\nAlso I'm not the only one they've done this to. A friend tried to rp with them like 2 months ago and apparently they planned out everything just for them to constantly say they were \"really busy\" for like a month straight. But they would also say they were really exited to start actually writing. If it was a one time thing I could overlook it but I guess I don't understand why they even bother?",

Here's the general rundown of my situation: There was this roleplayer who put out a pretty innocuous ad about a \"sweet/cute\" roleplays he'd been craving. I responded to the add, having a nice slice of life, sci-fi type plot reminiscent of the Saga comics that I had floating around. There were a few red flags right off the bat: A character that seemed to be a self-insert (not a deal-breaker by itself), a *very* sexual introduction to the character (again, this is a roleplay about two people raising a child together and falling in love??), and then tagging me a few hours with no response. There was also a strange moment where his character seemed to read my character's mind and respond to his thoughts. My issue: this roleplay is still basically brand-spanking new. I don't know what to do and when it's appropriate to cut it off. Do I give him some more chances or just give up? How do I politely end a roleplay that's only a day and a half old? I don't know if I'm overthinking this because of my social anxiety, buuuuuuuttt it's a big yikes from me and idk what to do.",

            "selftext": "I just wanted to get this off my chest. The RP is over now and I'm better without it because I was sick of walking on eggshells with this person.  \nSo here's the thing. I've been used to sharing NPCs- I don't mean named characters, but like, 'innkeeper' who is only there for one scene, things like that. Just saying that a bartender slid a glass to my character- that's something I've always kinda done. I recently met an RPer who wasn't okay with that- okay, no biggie, I'll adapt. Seriously, it didn't bother me much. I really liked their writing, we were having a good time. At least I thought so.  \n\n\nI tell all my RP partners I'm big on communication. If something is wrong, I want to know and work though it. So imagine my surprise when this happened;  \nThey said they were going to have a side character, an alchemist, enter the scene. My main was sick, their main asked the alchemist to come help. I said sure thing, could the alchemist have an apprentice because my main can't do much right now, so it would be fun to have someone to play. They said yes. I said okay cool, I'll work on an apprentice character and get ready to introduce him. Keep in mind, the alchemist and apprentice were only going to be there for this scene. Our characters were traveling before mine fell ill.  \n\n\nThey went off on me the moment after I said I'd get ready to have him enter the scene, too.  They said how I shouldn't be writing an apprentice who may not fit in for the alchemist they envisioned and I was taking over. We literally, only \\*minutes\\* prior, wrote that an alchemist would be entering the scene. They said I was rushing the scene, that I've rushed before, and it's disheartening to them. !? This was news to me, because they weren't exactly, you know, communicating this. I asked for examples, but they didn't give me any. Then they said I wasn't innovative enough, and I should be making more creative side characters, even after going off on the one I just made.  \n\n\nThe thing is- this is what frustrates me- I did try. I tried to make interesting side characters. But when I did, they said I was ruining their plans for a scene. That's what I tried to do with the apprentice, add some color, add a new personality to the scene. I try that, and I'm 'taking over'. So...which is it? Am I taking over if I try to write a side character, or am I not inventive enough by trying to put one in? There was absolutely no winning with this person. They always had to be write and talked down to me the \\*entire\\* time we were rping. I'm fine rping in someone else's world from time to time. If they had something specific in mind for certain scenes, that's totally okay. But you can't demand someone creates more side characters and say 'you're not innovative enough' after exploding at me for taking over because I was going to co-introduce someone. Just maddening.",

            "selftext": "Hello people, I am back with one of the most indecent weapons I ever reviewed. I found the document in my google doc, so I said, why not submit it to you after I edited that down a little bit? Anyway, enjoy this small theat from me!\n\nSo one year ago, I was the only moderator of a server since the owner left for technical issues, and I was tasked to approve and disapprove characters and stuff. Enters MC player extraordinaire, a guy I knew he was kinda famous for edgy and OP-ish characters. I however had recently disbanded from the \"friends\" and their bullcrap, so I tried my best to brace and listen to this guy not wanting to shut him down just because his past. Spoiler alert, I was dumb.\n\nHe submits a pretty simple half elf, nothing particularly dangerous, apart from the fact he had a dark phoenix as master, which luckily couldn't take part in the events of the Roleplay for the simple fact the two would have given a significant and unfair advantage to any faction they would have joined (the phoenix's sheet was something impossible to approve as he went against at least three or four rules). \n\nUltimately, I thought this guy may have changed, and that he could finally roleplay normally his half elf with not many powertrips or anime tropes.\n\nThen enters this super duper heavy blade he places in approval, claiming this sword to be his character's weapon after the guy got approved. \nIt is made of the king of the dragons bone, and it has its spirit melded in it. \nIt had a google doc alongside it, which I will transcribe to you all to admire this OP fest.\n\n**Please notice: Some limits, as MC guy liked to call it, were toned down by me. Where it is written tungesten and iron, in origin there was written \"diamonds\". Where the sword can \"see the muscles and body contraction, it was once written it could see through walls and detect every weakness and weak point everything. That sword could cut diamonds before I toned that stuff down. FML**\n\n\n---The limits of the blade are these:\n\n\n1. It can summon swords but it won't be like Gilgamesh's style from Fate. It will only be 4 blades and they follow the original sword aka like a cat with a laser pointer it follows.\u00a0\n\n\n2. The blade can heat itself to pierce stronger things like steel but it's for one strike at a time.\n\n\n3. The mind of a dragon (which the blade is made of) is stuck inside the sword so it can possess the MC and speak through them.\u00a0\n\n\n4. It can also give the MC dragon-like limbs eyes and arms depending which arm the dragon's power is manifested. The limb can only be one, it can be manifested with the whole body but right now there is only one sense the power is too much and it could make the MC body explode. So that's why they can only use it in a portion of their body.\n\n\n5. It has healing and resistant properties. Healing on the body is only physical, able to heal injuries that would normally kill the user, however the healing can be canceled with enough damage (as in repeatedly attacking) and they can regrow limbs (it is resistant as in a steel arm where the dragon arm limb is)\u00a0\n\n\n6. The blade can change to another when the original blade is consumed into the body and instead of using fire it with be black electricity (This will not behave differently, but only how it will look and how they react example previously it burns cause of flames now it shocks the enemy and the electricity can hurt the user. The effect will last till the transformation ends)\n\n\n7. When the eyes of the sword go purple the user can hold\u00a0the MC's Dark phoenix mentor's force a bit. They will have to stop when they starts to send a small heat wave on the area. (5 turns)\n\n\n8. The strength and senses of the user are augmented. The strength will be enough to bend iron and claw through it, it can break rock easily and throw a human body with ease, but it increases their weight making it hard to swim and making wind magic hard to use. The sense will be able to be detected by the aura that people give out.\n\n\n9. Another skill is to be able to see someone's muscles and body contractions. (It can be used when the blade power is manifested)\n\n\n10. The blade is very resistant, similar to a big thick and strong layer of tungsten to support big impacts from dragon-like attacks. The blade can be broken but it will be able to be reforged if it rest in lava and the thick scale will start to remake itself (it will take 3 days of rp in other to be reforged)---\n\n\nUltimately, I never finished the approval session of this sword. Issues went down with an event this MC player was illegally planning without any consent of submods and myself, and failed to comply to my questions as I guess I was getting annoying to him. \nThe super-duper sword was never approved, but I kept the doc as memento. \n\nPerhaps one day I may speak about the event he was planning, as I still got that doc as well. \n\nBut enough speaking of me or MC. What was the most OP or gamebreaking weapon one of your players submitted to your server? How did you acted? I am here to read the worst xD\n\nStay safe everyone",

It's going great, loving it and excited to get it going. The pair are talking about a drug ring and my partner is bringing in a lot of npc background characters in the mix which is fine, I like that, and talking for them and I'm interacting with them but not talking for them as i didn't introduce them.\n\nWhen it's my turn to reply again i mention my character has a rapport with someone and planned to write as them, had a whole idea for my next reply and wa ready to go\n\nThen they replied. Not only did this hijack the background character introduced but have them a name, wrote their dialogue and the proceeded to say that my character went somewhere; outside the scene ( without my permission) and after sending me out had a full on conversation with their character and my background character.\n\nI had no idea what to do. They took the whole scene and sent me away and went on without me, how am i supposed to reply and jump back in when they did everything without even asking? So I work up courage and message them that i didn't like it and was trying to be a polite as I could and note that i wasn't trying to ask them to rewrite it all , just tweak it, so they say sure and write part of it again, only this time they say that my character stayed in the car and continued to again take over the npc and have a conversation \n\nI don't want to drop the roleplay but isn't not godmodding the roleplay basics? I like the plot but I keep getting written out and I don't know how to jump back in when they clearly want to he the star or game master. How am i supposed to contribute when my character is literally sent away and they are writing against themselves? This has literally never happened to me before and i don't know what to do as i like the rp but it's already killed ye whole idea i had and I relate didn't like being written out of things when as far as I know, cop partners usually do everything together.",

            "selftext": "I'm currently struggling with this, and I don't have anyone else to vent to or get feedback from...\n\nSo I'm doing a great RP with this guy, he seems nice a little odd but otherwise, we ended up clicking after a few weeks of me trying to break the ice via OOC. We both have the same sarcastic/self-deprecating humor and obviously have our own mental hurdles we're working to overcome. I love his writing and even though he's a little quirky, I consider us decent friends in the online sense, at least. Lately his posts have slowed down but hey, it's a busy time of year for many reasons so I don't say anything. Life comes first.\n\nWe still have a decent OOC banter going so I don't have any qualms about posts coming less frequently. Like I said, I really like his writing and characterization of this canon/canon thing we have going on. But during our OOC chatter, we (mostly him though) keep saying how our recent IC post felt poor or lackluster. This happens with almost every post. I guess we're a little anxious like that. We'd assure the other this wasn't the case but he began to get really critical of himself. I didn't see any issue with his posts (maybe a missed word/typo here or there but his content and choices were always so well-done, I never bothered to nitpick). That said, he's been more earnest about editing as needed, which I think is silly. He keeps claiming he can redo the post if I want or apologizes for the lack of quality. I mean I like to take shots at myself but deep down, I know I like at least 75% of my posts, despite any doubts I may have. And I worry my partner truly doesn't like his own writing when I adore it.\n\nObjectively I know this isn't my place. It's not my job to continue to cheerlead my partner. That if he doesn't like his post, it's on him to fix what issues he feels it has (it doesn't have any in my mind). And to either accept not every post will be solid gold, or wait until you feel more confident to post. I do not pressure him though, I would be disappointed to wait a week or two for a reply but I know it would be worth it and if it would help his mental health, of course he can take all the time he needs to feel comfortable with his output. \n\nI guess it just bums me out while annoying me. Like, you have a partner you enjoy and click with and they're in their head too much, self-sabotaging. They recently said in OOC if they couldn't muster up a post tomorrow, they might just walk away. We've been RPing for maybe 2-3 months. I love our RP, it's my favorite one and losing it would be quite the loss. I wish I could show my partner how awesome I view their writing but at the end of the day I feel like my praise keeps falling on deaf ears or blind eyes I suppose.\n\nI know whatever insecurities they have, I can't magically fix but I would hate to lose a partner because they somehow have convinced themselves they aren't good enough for me or the story. Can anyone give any feedback on how to boost someone's confidence? I have been in his position and mine, before, and I want to approach my partner from a place of concern, rather than selfishness. Anyone have any thoughts or have had a partner like this, who can offer tips to ease up on the negative thoughts my partner and I probably should joke less about?",

            "selftext": "This has been a long time coming at this point. I really tried to hold the patience of a rock but there's just no way I can literally bother myself with this anymore.\n\nI joined a Naruto roleplay. I was impressed by the amount of work and finesse the creators must have put into it and I expected my experience with them to be pretty solid.\n\nAllow me to digress: it wasn't.\n\nI joined, made a character and it was approved. Standard procedure. Now comes the time to type, plot and do all those kind of things. But I come across this person that literally is the death of this site and it's the owner themselves.\n\nWe make a roleplay and it goes smoothly at first. \n\nOur characters, mine a dude and theirs a girl, aren't exactly tapping well as one is pompous and fiery and the other is peaceful and acts cutesy. \n\nBut it was going anyways as they could at least enjoy the clash of personalities until I begin to get replies very... rarely. We're talking more than one week of waiting for this person to post three paragraphs (that's their length and I don't shame them for it but hear me out)\n\nThey say they're busy and that's pretty cool. We're both having this as a hobby, after all. But then I wake up the next day and have seen them initiate a number of five roleplays. Two with one person and three with another, all with different characters.\n\nWho are you bullshitting at this point?\n\nI don't bring it up. I roleplay with somebody else but at that point I request a change of face claim to try and get some variety as mine had very little variety in the possible pictures available.\n\nThey deny it saying it's because of the different hair color.\n\nWe kind of debate it for a good half and a hour about how it's silly; we are given over a month of time to make drastic changes to our character after approval and I can't change its face claim? What happened to the rules?\n\nSo at this point I at least try and find more threads... but I realize my options are pretty slim. Because I just noticed most people who joined around the same time as me and I was kind of talking with, had already left (or a few even got banned).\n\nI don't take this very well and I lament the lack of plot. The owner comes in general chat saying we can roleplay more together with their other characters and to that I pretty much say a big fat no.\n\nWhy? I go and notice all of the threads they started a few days earlier are now sitting there, waiting on their reply. So at this point I already anticipate I'll just make myself wait double if I am to roleplay with this person on their other characters.\n\nBut they take this personally and feels offended that I don't take them as \"enough\" or satisfying enough to roleplay with.\n\nI am appalled because they basically make themselves out to be the victim of me not wanting to roleplay with them but they won't even reply to our roleplays (we actually already made another. I forgot to mention this, but it came shortly after the first I already mentioned before)\n\nOr anyone else to the matter. What they do the next day... is begin two more with two other characters. And even now as of today they are sitting there.\n\nIt's been a few weeks now that I have been stale on this place and I basically have been thinking to just leave it behind and find something else.\n\nBecause another staff member proposed an idea for a roleplay that isn't even so bad. But something is repelling me: they want a fight between my character and their Jinchuuriki. \n\nAll good, right? But let me explain. This roleplay allows players to become a Jinchuuriki after earning it in a special event where the Bijuu (Tailed Beast) appears.\n\nBy the way, this roleplay just started. \n\nAnd there have been no events whatsoever. \n\nYes, staff could just begin as Jinchuuriki unlike the players. And that staff member is not the only one. I looked at other characters and even the owner has their own Jinchuuriki AND a Sage; something you can't make until you have been active for two constant months.\n\nAnd just as of now it may have been enough for a player to make a Sage assuming they made a character and started roleplaying right after the roleplay was opened to the public.\n\nSo these alone have basically killed my mood to try much here. I don't want to sound like a bitch but this literally gives the vibe of 'you can get anything if you're staff or their friend maybe. If you're a common mortal, well good luck'. \n\nFurthermore I am pretty sure by now the owner has me in their guts. A newbie asked for help with their pictures in an ask staff channel, I offered to help since other staff members were offline. And I did help the newbie. \n\nWhat happens is that the owner comes on and begins deleting my messages and scolds the fact that I answered despite not being staff.\n\nThey reprimanded that they have rules and I need to follow them, no matter. Yeah. \n\nThen why doesn't staff need to follow the Jinchuuriki or Sage rules? Are they exempt from the law everyone needs to follow? \n\nThat right there is bullshit. \n\nThe guy wanted help with his pictures, not with questions about their characters, rules or whatever else.\n\nSo yeah. By now I basically feel like the owner just keeps shutting me down and I see no real reason to stick around in a place that probably does not have long to live, either.\n\nHalf the people who joined around the same time as I did are already gone, either they left accordingly or they were banned because they vented about something regarding staff or the roleplay.\n\nBut what should I do? I had high hopes for this and I still do, in a way. I am kind of conflicted. Should I give it a few days? Leave completely or maybe just go inactive and focus on something else, maybe with the hope something might change? I don't know myself yet but the chances are pretty thin if you ask me.\n\nAnd I don't know. I usually lurk around here or other roleplay boards but I never really wanted to post here before, you know? That's until I got so annoyed I felt like sharing might at least make me calm down about this. I feel like it kind of did.",

            "selftext": "I apologize for any grammatical errors for English isn't my native tongue. I also apologize for this turning out longer than I expected. I just needed to get this out of my chest.\n\nI haven't actually roleplayed in a long time now so when I joined this fandom rp months ago I was hyped. The admins/mods took a setting I liked and made it even better. It's also a pretty active group so I got even more excited. Thus I decided to join with one of my favorite OCs (albeit with a few tweaks to suit the twists to the lore).\n\nIntrigued, I checked the roster. And guess what? My OC was there already. Sure the person made some changes but they basically just made a \"what if XYZ had a great childhood and truly became good\" AU of my character. \n\nGender, motifs, the colors, their specialties, their demeanor (my OC poses as a meek do gooder while \"theirs\" is genuinely a meek goody two shoes), and even the name were all taken! I am the type who always liked to evoke The Meaningful Name trope. So when I name Japanese OCs, I make sure to look up the possible kanji characters for the name I like and have each character say something related to my OC (be it their appearance, personality, birth order, foreshadowing, themes, etc). Not only the name but I do painstaking research on any background, personality type, culture, etc. that I use in my characters. It may seem like minor things but the name and motifs were pretty much my confirmation that they were stolen. The kanji I used for that name aren't typically the characters used for this name so seeing the exact combination used was an unpleasant surprise.\n\nI will be the first to admit that my character isn't something that's never been done before in media. I mean, what is even truly original these days right? Still, it hurts to have a character you have so much love for and put so much effort into just be stolen like that. Perhaps it's weird but I am also the type of writer to put a piece of myself (no matter how little or seemingly unimportant) to my characters which is why this feels very personal to me.\n\nNow you may be wondering, how on earth did somebody stole this OC if most of my previous writing of them are privately published for myself (and a couple of irl friends)? Well, I joined a large rp in this fandom a year ago. And surprise! The new rp I joined is a reboot with some of the staff and players from before. All key info about my character was posted and previously discussed in that old group. \n\nOf course I brought up my thoughts to the new group's staff and members. They told me that the character wasn't always used and I can still take the slot if I wanted to. But it's still just not the same you know? It's hard to erase this nagging worry that no matter what I'll do it will seem like I'm the copycat; that my OC will be compared to the one the group recently played with. The latter is really possible since my OC is a person that's hard to like compared to the copy OC. Not to mention, it felt like my words weren't being taken as seriously since the copycat OC is still in the roster after I told them my story. There were also off-topic memes and discussions while I was sharing my qualms.\n\nI am sorry again for the long rant. I'm just really so upset about this that it turned me off of rping anywhere again. Maybe I'll go back again to the scene in a few months or so. I don't know.\n\n[ If you are a member of this rp and you recognize me or my post because of the sheer amount of detail I mentioned... then okay. Feel free to chat with the others about how dramatic I am. I haven't logged in ages anyway. ]",

            "selftext": "Okay. Basically me and my to partner has gotten to the point where I\u2019ve just realized how sexist they actually are. I thought they were really cool and stuff but nope.\n\nWe came to a point in the story where our characters are getting pissed off with the heroes. Okay, everything makes sense. A bunch of villains being pissed that some heroes are getting in the way of their ultimate plan to dominate the world. Nothing wrong there.\n\nProblem is, there was a slight malfunction in a few of their super soldier robots. (Keep in mind these robots were formally heroes themselves and they had become bad guys because the villains took them over.)\n\nA few of their robots started going against them. One female, and the other two male. The one male was acting too much like a father to one of the major Villain\u2019s subordinates, and the female was acting too much like a mother.\n\nShe openly insulted the Villain, saying that his methods of protection and changing the world were flawed, and she felt upset that the Villain was taking their Daughter (subordinate) away.\n\nThe father felt the same exact paternal feelings, but just never expressed them. The mother wanted to express them and be motherly to the Daughter, but also wanted a world of kindness for her. (Since they were both pissed with the world outside).\n\nTell me why my Partner\u2019s Villain is going to be MORE pissed at her than at him? Both of them were being as equally paternal/maternal as the other. Each sent letters and poems to the daughter, each did this and that. But the Villain was more pissed with HER than with him.\n\nIn fact, he went out of his way to say \u201cMiss Thing\u201d and \u201cWeak willed bitch\u201d over and over again to her. But to the guy? He rarely said a thing. He called her feelings \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdemure\u201d and pretty much praised and perved on the \u201cstrong and masculine\u201d Daddy type.\n\nHe even went on a private tirade to another NPC I was controlling, saying stupid shit like \u201cwomen suck are women just this stupid to be special?\u201d\n\nAnd I was just fucking livid. \n\nAnd then he (the character)had the nerve to be like \u201cI don\u2019t remember the Mother being this \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cin love with feminine\u201d things\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m-\n\nHe barely gave me anything to WORK with! He gave me his character to work and jazz up, and then all of sudden he says \u201cthat\u2019s now how she acts?\u201d After ALL this time of developing her? \n\nIt was just beyond stupid to me. \n\nBut then things started making sense with how stupid his characters are anyhow. All they are are these overly masculine \u201cpaternal\u201d types that the other characters have to fawn over and bat their eyes at. While the feminine characters are to be mocked, shamed, or even joked about.\n\nI had a feminine male villain before, and he pretty much made me change him because he wasn\u2019t acting \u201chard\u201d enough and was acting \u201ccatty\u201d. And even blamed the clothes he wore for changing his mindset. So I had to do a complete overhaul on his outfit, his personality, and demeanor just to \u201cfit\u201d what he wanted.\n\nBut guess what? He finds the idea of boobs on muscular men to be funny/hot, finds the idea of androgyne and dressing up in dresses for muscular men to be hot and funny, and finds the idea of feminine men to be funny and hot to HIS standards.\n\nI\u2019m just so tired of dealing with this. First this asshole is not going to give me a reference sheet to a character he created and then he\u2019s going to IC blame me for \u201cmaking her weak willed\u201d.\n\nAnd then he\u2019s going to pretty much shit all over feminine men and women for no reason other than he can.\n\nAnd I\u2019m just wondering, is being motherly or being a good mom banned in his eyes? Can people only be fatherly or \u201cpaternally sexy?\u201d Why is it when she was being a Motherly figure to the Daughter, she was seen as weak and stupid, but when the Father was being \u201cpaternal\u201d to them, no one batted a damn eye?\n\nFuck that.",

            "selftext": "So recently, I stumbled upon a page on the internet that explains Mary Sue tropes in great detail. It got me thinking back to this one problematic writer in my group. She had so many red flags, and she kept getting defensive over any criticisms we made towards her. Today, I wanted to go over the first character I saw when she joined my superhero campaign.\n\nFor starters, the name of her character. I'll let you guess what she used for the character's name. It wasn't something super special or overly long like Sephiroth or Sapphire. Nope, she used her own first name. That's right, we have a self insert right off the bat. \n\nNow for appearance. The character has golden colored eyes, an underweighted body and CAT EARS. According to the trope page, these traits can usually be found in Mary Sue characters to make them stand out among the rest of the ordinary characters. For the eyes and cat ears, she justifies this by saying her character was created in a lab to be a super soldier. However, that means she did a lot of training too, and there is no way she could retain an underweighted body. \n\nThis bleeds into skills. The character not only has claws, but she also uses a sword and a whip. Fighting with the sword would be difficult if she doesn't have the muscle to back it up. And yet, the writer makes her sound like a top tier superhero who is much better than the others. As for weaknesses, she doesn't seem to have any physical weaknesses at all. Just the one where she claims to be shy from others. \n\nAt one point, we had killed the character off because she had left the forum. When she found out what we did, she threw a massive hissy fit and claimed how her character should have been able to win most of her battles. \n\nNow for the worst part. This is more of a personal matter, but she kept on insisting that her character be shipped with my character. I gently let her down and had my character shipped with someone else's, which made her jealous. Even though I had made it very clear that my character was dating another, she still kept insisting and shipping her character with mine. I felt like she had made her character just to be dating my character, which creeped me out. \n\nThis brings me into author investment. There is no doubt that she was strongly interested in her character, but she always had to use the same character in all her works. This can be done properly in roleplays if you change things up a little, but I just find it weird that she uses her first name. Criticisms against her character are always out the window when we present them. Oh, and she tends to post the character's face claim every chance she gets. \n\nAnyways, I hope others learn not to make these same mistakes. Characters are likable because they are relatable and flawed, instead of someone who is automatically good at everything and doesn't learn anything by the end of a story arc.",

I don\u2019t like to jump into something without us chatting with each other a bit! I know everybody doesn\u2019t like to talk ooc; I at least wanted to introduce myself. He told me his name and how glad he was that I responded! We started chatting for a few seconds and then he brings up one of his other prompts. He sent me the starter for it.. Y\u2019all, this man sent me a starter about a 50 year old man on a ship raping a young girl. Huh??? First off, you don\u2019t send someone some shit like that! (Excuse me for being vulgar!) Rape is a sensitive topic and a trigger for some. Ripping off her clothes and forcing her to do things with your character? Uh, no. He wanted to do that instead of the one I wrote...

            "selftext": "First off, yes this was smut focused. If you hate that keep it to yourself\nAnyways I met this guy several years ago in an rp server, I only ever got to rp with two people there as one seemingly didn't like me and the rest constantly lusted for and talked 24/7 about Dragonropa and politics. I told my two friends I left and we made our own servers to rp on, eventually the friend simply stopped fairly doubling down on what we were doing, constantly replying to situations where I was playing a female for them and flat out ignoring the ones where he was playing females for me. I confronted him about it, he did nothing to show an attempt at improving the situation so I just quietly left the server and unfriended him to see if he'd notice.\n\n4 months later, he sends a request and asks if I'd like to give him another shot. Being a nice guy I accepted his offer... and my stuff never got past 2-3 posts while his had 20-30 posts each! Eventually my depression was making me feel terrible towards him so again I left but told him goodbye.\n\nCue 4 months ago, 6 months or more after the previous time. He actually apologized and said he felt awful, begging for another chance and being somewhat desperate for partners myself, I accepted.\n\nWe start off and things are actually going well.... but then he started just ignoring my halves again. I told him I wasn't replying until he did mine, he apologized and said he'd focus on mine for a bit to make up for it.\n\nFew posts later, he doesn't reply but we still talked and I never pushed him to reply, he apologized for it himself, always saying \"I'll reply when I get home, sorry for the wait.\" I patiently wait... Weeks later he says the same thing all at once. Today I pointed out he hadn't replied in 3 months and stated if he lost interest then I'd understand and leave. He apologized and said we could try a new rp when he has time... I finally had enough, unfriended for the final time and called things off.\n\nI hate getting my hopes up for posts that simply aren't coming and I don't like confronting people to reply when they probably aren't even interested or simply lost interest.\n\nI'll miss him but we're better off without an rp partnership, just done :/",

            "selftext": "Wowie, another rant, let's go. This is pretty strongly based around someone else's post, they reminded me just how much I needed to get this off my chest.\n\nDue to not talking about a specific person, ill name whatever I can for convience. I grew up roleplaying in the creepypasta Fandom, it was where I first learned what it was back in..2015 I think? Or very early 2016.\n\nIf you know anything about that Fandom, you know how common mary/Gary stues were. The thing was, because of this, people seemed to have forgotten the actual definition of the word. And it created a fear inside me I think alot of people secretly have as well. That no matter what you do or create, you need to step on glass as to not accidentally made a horrible oc. Because people call EVERY character a self insert, a Mary sue, a Gary stu, whatever; what else is there really to do?\n\nThey can't make someone look unique by different hair colors or so, you can't add onto things like heterochromia or albinoism, they can't be too feminine or too masculine, they can't be too powerful but also not too weak, God forbid they have more than one mental illness. And how DARE you make the character relatable to yourself? \n\nFor those who really don't know\n\u25a0Mary sue: A character that's bascially perfect. Everybody loves them, they never do anything wrong, their only flaws are clich\u00e9 things like \"they're clumsy, but in a cute way\". A Mary sue is NOT automatically someone with wealth, someone who was royalty, someone with a decently positive social status, someone's whos overcome ab*se, or someone who looks unique.\n\u25a0Gary sue: The opposite, bascially a character that's so hated they just turn extremely edgy or even boring to play with due to \"they're depressed so they refuse to talk or move or progress the story at all\". A Gary sue is NOT automatically someone with a tragic backstory, someone's who's had bad experiences with people, someone that suffers from truama or mental illness, someone shy, a more rude character, an antagonist, someone who's a part of a sub culture like emo or goth.\n\u25a0Self insert: A character almost completely based on yourself but usually either alot better or worse, going over to the Mary/Gary sue zone. A self insert is NOT automatically a character that's relatable to others, or shares certain facts with the creator. \n\nNot everybody's a Mary sue, or a Gary sue. And its kinda ridiculous how often people seem to think the bare minimum of tropes means the whole character is awful (no, this is absolutely not directed towards this subreddit, yall are chill). \n\nYou wanna make an oc who's a princess/prince that goes against the system? Go for it. You wanna give your character an extreme backstory? Sure, just make sure to represent it well, heavy topics deserve respect. You wanna make a character who's actually pretty happy and decently liked within their community? Ofcourse.\n\nPlease stop abusing the terms specifically made for ACTUALLY bad characters. The fact that someone is a little edgy looking isn't nearly as bad as someone who's extremely overpowered, pushes on your boundaries, takes the light or enegery out of you/your character, refuses to move a storyline, makes everything boring or tiring for others, constantly triggers others with no respect for what's okay and not, or just plain out a bitch.\n\nMaybe I'm old fashioned, I haven't roleplayed using ocs in a while now, so maybe this is barely an issue at all anymore. But it WAS, and made me extremely anxious when creating characters myself. I'm finally starting to be more okay with things, but for the longest time I felt really restricted, and it sucks.",

            "selftext": "I connected with this chick for the purposes of doing some longterm modern/SoL plots. Everything seemed to be going fairly decently, in that she knew that she was looking for and had some nifty ideas to bring to the table in terms of plots and characters. It was great, and I was actually (stupidly) getting my hopes up that this would be a viable longterm partner with whom I can create some awesome connections with. \n\nThis is where shit began going south. In my wanted ad, I specifically stated that I am looking for pretty active writers, as I can provide a response at least once a day if not multiple and would like the same in return. Obviously, circumstances will come up irl that call for full attention to non-rp endeavors; family emergencies, vacations, just being out of town for whatever, etc. Those are completely understandable, but like overall I am seeking someone who can provide what I am providing in terms of frequency. \n\nShe appeared to be completely surprised by this, despite it being in my ad, and went on to say that her life is pretty chaotic and that she would probably be able to provide a response biweekly or monthly. *Biweekly or monthly.* Once again, I completely understand that all of us have shit going on irl and that many of us can't just be glued to our devices cranking out responses. But this was a hard limit for me.\n\nI told her directly that it's probably not going to work out, that at that rate I would lose muse and there would be no point in attempting something because personally, for me, that's just too long in between responses. She didn't respond for a while, so I had assumed that she had simply taken that info and went about her day with it in the search of other partners, but of course not. \n\nShe hits me up later and basically says that she thinks it could work because \"we seem to connect on a lot and I think that we could just write longer responses to make up for the long time between them\". Once more, I politely declined and told her that no, that wouldn't work for me. Not because I don't like long responses, but because again, that is too much time between responses for me. I even said that maybe we can write later on when she has more time on her hands because after all, her ideas and characters were interesting.\n\nThis is where she appears to have gotten pissed, for she hit me back with claims that I am being severely inflexible and that she has \"so much that you have no clue about\" going on behind the scenes, she even wrote out a dissertation about how she's struggling with health issues and that one of her kids is chronically ill so she's in and out of the hospital a lot, \"on top of 3 jobs\", basically giving me her entire life story as if I'm her counselor. Mind you, she called me inflexible a total of 3 times throughout this dissertation, and passive-aggressively told me that she \"didn't think I would be like everyone else with regards to this.\" \n\nBro, what? I don't know you from a can of paint for one, and additionally, how am I inflexible when I *told you directly in my wanted ad* that I am seeking people who are fairly active? Now do they have to respond every day? Absolutely not, but biweekly or monthly doesn't cut it for me. I can't get into a story with that frequency, and there's no issue with that, just like there is no issue with only being able to provide a monthly response if that's your thing. But attempting to lay out your whole life story in between calling someone \"very inflexible\" and pressuring them into saying yes just because \"I'm a good writer so I can make up for the frequency\" isn't going to fly. I eventually had to block her because she wouldn't stop spamming my shit with \"Hello????\" and \"??????\" \n\nI've never had an experience like this before and I am so beyond irritated and disappointed. Don't pressure someone into writing with you on your terms, and don't use your kids' ailments or whatever as an excuse for why people should write with you despite the frequency of responses not being up to par with what they want. That's not cool.",

            "selftext": "I am asking for input from the community on this to avoid being the bad roleplayer in the situation. I connected with this chick and we started an awesome roleplay, I am talking an amazing one that is perhaps one of my favorites that I have done this year. She understood exactly the vibe that I was going for and reflected it 100%, our characters connected and we were rapid firing at the beginning. I finally felt that excitement for writing again that has been withered away at by less-than-fitting partners, and I was really hoping that we could maintain the energy in order to progress with the plot and see where it took us. \n\nThings eventually started slowing down; we went from rapid firing a few responses a day to a response per day, to eventually a response every couple of days or so. She told me that things were busy at work for her, which is totally understandable, real life always takes precedent/comes first so I didn't think too much of it. This was back during the first week of December, the last time that I had heard from her ooc and received a response ic. I reached out to her on the 17th of this month, just kind of checking in to see what the status is and if everything is alright. Again, I totally get that shit happens and that this time of the year can be especially hectic for some folks, what with the holidays. \n\nAfter not hearing back for a few days, I reached out again on the 23rd just to state that I hope everything is well and that I would like to know if there is still an interest in our plot. I'm not going to lie, I am semi-hurt and disappointed, despite having tried not to get my hopes up to begin with. Usually when things are going this great, it's only a matter of time before they fall apart, at least from the pattern that I've been able to decipher. \n\nHonestly, what do you guys think at this point? Is there any reason to continue hoping for a response? How do I go about this, how long would you wait before reaching out again or deleting the server? Is it done? It's just a shitty experience.",

            "selftext": "I've never actually had a problem with OP characters before since I usually do more SOL oriented things, so this was a first for me. \n\nThis person's main issue was that they were OP for no reason and constantly retconned their characters abilities.\n\nThe premise of the rp is that my character is supposed to be a guidance to their character with magic. My character doesn't have magic but is a magical being and helps others with their skill and understanding.\n\nWe had discussed that their character was supposed to not even know that they had magic. It was like a modern fantasy setting where the real world is a thing, but there's secret magic stuff. So obviously they would know nothing about magic other than folklore and definitely not know about their own magic.\n\nThem not knowing about their magic is thrown out the window almost immediately despite their own responses saying otherwise. They are suddenly very aware how to use their power. They can levitate, conjure random things up, teleport, and give very very long descriptions of I don't even know what but it resulted in a literal mushroom cloud. (They did all of these things completely unprompted while my character was trying to have a conversation with them)\n\nI don't know why I didn't say anything. Maybe I was just seeing how much worse it could get, or I was too awkward and didn't know how to bring it up, or I knew that we weren't really clicking anyway style and length wise. Most likely a combination of all of those. Plus I really wanted to play my idea. So I really dont want to see comments about COmMunICatIOn!! Alright?\n\nSo their character suddenly knows and have known for a long time that they have powers and they use these powers for personal gain. My character says that it's a disgrace to use magic like that and their character starts having an Elsa-like meltdown with crying and things flying around the room so my character is like fuck this shit I'm out but their character doesn't let them and says that they do in fact need help with magic but moreso just to hold it back.\n\nMy character asks what gives them power and they basically respond with: everything. All of the elements, animals, their blood, plants, the stars. I'm not exaggerating, these are the things they listed other than blatantly saying \"everything\".\n\nAnd so my character is like okay but what about the thing that gives you the MOST power out of all of those things? And they went with astral stuff. Okay.\n\nBut then suddenly they just have another magic mentor that was in the room the whole time? Mentors that are supposed to be sent by goddesses to help people out with magic, just happens to be there and is apparently very shitty at their job based on how their character can't control their magic and has no respect for the morality of it.\n\nMy character points out that they are extremely bad at their job, to which they insult mine back. That's fine, reasonable reaction. But they didn't seem to have any other personality than just insulting my character after that. They didn't say anything other than insults. No information about themselves or anything. It almost seemed like they just wrote the character in so that they could say bad things about my character without their own character facing the consequences of it.\n\nIt was at that point that I left. Not because I care about anyone insulting my character, but because having another mentor there is really, really stupid.",

            "selftext": "What do you consider character controlling, in terms of god mode?\n\nI see it being a repetitive habit in a lot of stories, but the threshold of what is deemed \"controlled\" varies wildly, and I know most of it is rather subjective. But I'm curious either way, only because if I happen to fall into a \"controlling\" range, I want to be able to recognize it and include it in my RP information or attempt to change it before I scare someone off.\n\nThat being said, I'm not one to force full actions onto characters, or affect dialogue; the only time I fully godmode is to remove trouble players and shut down their shenanigans, and even then I developed a system to regulate how that works in my current server. However, I DO think:\n\n1) if someone has opened, or generally leads, a chat, they have at least a bit of power to nudge things along. I consider it to be a GM status, and that is likely because of how it runs in my main group, so they can do what they need to to some extent to get the plot going. That requires players to trust the CM (Chat Master, ha) won't scree with them too hard, though; without that, everyone gets upset. This is not an excuse to God mode though, at least I hope so; if there was, for example, a hallway that the CM knew had traps and wanted to try and separate someone from the party for reasons, and they activate a trap door underneath one of them, we would write it as \"a trap door flipped open suddenly underfoot, revealing a black void below\", we wouldn't add \"and they fell through\",  we would see how they react to the prompt and go from there. But would the suddenness and seeming \"impossible\" reaction time be god moding to people who play realistically?\n\n2) I play with prompts often when I CM chats, and because of that I tend to be more suggestive and proactive in what goes on. My current partner doesn't mind it because we both tend to do it to each other in different chats when we have a story (sometimes we drop openers on each other just to spice up boring daily life and test pilot new characters), so in the lead position I know it's up to me to describe things and so on (I even draw up floor plans sometimes), but I also will lay things such as sensations, sounds or \"vibes\" onto their character to try and tell a story without spelling it out and see how they react. Is that considered god moding to you? She's not against it, but I don't know if anyone outside my group would be offended if I told them \"the viscous liquid felt like ooblek but wasn't cold--rather, it was somewhat warm, as if it had body heat, and swirled around their finger with intention, as if investigating,\" rather than let them decide how to react or how it felt.\n\nProbably sounds dumb now that I'm spelling it out, but these are concerns I have from reading stories here and worry I may chase off potential partners and be mislabelled a \"character controlling godmode\" due to these preferences.\n\nThank all.",

            "selftext": "Okay so I consider myself a laid back person with a lot of patience. I\u2019m flexible when it comes to genre, third or first person, writing style, different varieties of detail, and matching my partners on what they prefer. I have my main rule of absolutely no sex scenes.(no acceptations) I believe my grammar is pretty good though I have dyslexia so I make a few mistakes.\n\nNow I post on all kinds of different platforms and deal with the same thing constantly. People reach out to me, tell me their style and a genre they like, and boom! Many ideas pop into my head for a roleplay. I tell them to be completely honest I won\u2019t be hurt. I know people have preferences. So they give their opinions. Well I usually at least have one they get hyped up about. So we talk about the roleplay a bit then discuss characters. I send an oc bio and tell them if they want me to add anything I gladly will or they can send theirs and I\u2019ll edit mine to meet their standards. \n\nWe get through characters and they say mine works perfectly. I ask if they prefer to start or if they want me to. I\u2019m good either way. Again I\u2019m easygoing. But I never get a response. This happens so often. Don\u2019t waste my damn time if you don\u2019t actually want to roleplay. ESPECIALLY IF YOU MAKE ME DISCUSS THE ROLEPLAY FOR OVER A WEEK!!! \n\nI have been a few minutes into our oc\u2019s meeting and the person stopped the roleplay calling mine a Mary Sue. Like what?! They met in detention! She\u2019s a rebel grease monkey that always gets in fights! First off, meeting someone in real life you aren\u2019t likely to find out their flaws within a few minutes. A lot of people hide them. Second, I put some personality flaws in their bio so people know. I with never play a Mary Sue. They are boring as hell. There will always be some major flaw on top of many little ones. This isn\u2019t the only time I\u2019ve been told my character seems like a Mary Sue after a few minutes but frankly people need to get to know characters better.\n\nAlright if you made it to here thanks for reading. If my easygoing and flexible nature interests you then go ahead and dm me. Or if you just want a friend to talk to and rant with, hit me up. I truly care and like to be there for people if they want it. (Some current partners have become close friends that I have a blast just talking to.)",

            "selftext": "or self inserts. Not everyone, of course. Here are some examples:\n\n\\-some guy I roleplayed with called everyone of my characters a self-insert if they had only a little thing in common with me. Like, I could write a character who was 6'4, liked action movies and sports (nothing in common with me at all), and add something like 'and he likes reading comics'. And when I was chatting with this guy ooc, he would be like 'Wait a minute...didn't you tell me last week that you were reading a comic? You have so much in common, I think you like writing characters like this because...' and then he want on trying to explain to me why I relate so much to this character, while neither knowing very much about me nor the character. It was so annoying. He also claimed that everyone who preferred evil characters did so because they had an evil side they are hiding and stuff like that. Even if a character shares some traits with me, they are not supposed to be me. I do not relate to everything they do, and sometimes, I write characters who have absolutely nothing in common with me at all.\n\n\\-claiming that certain fantasy races or hybrids between different races are automatically Mary Sues just by virtue of belonging to aforementioned race. Yes, I know, a demon-angel-vampire-dragon girl always raises red flags. But creating a hybrid can actually be done well, add to the characters story and make an interesting character. I hate it if people have to limit their creativity or the possibilities of their created world just because they fear that this would be cringy or make their characters instant Mary Sues. No, not every character with certain features is a Mary Sue just because these features are often used by people who write Mary Sues. It is okay if you personally don't want to write certain stuff, but don't mock everyone who does.\n\n\\-claiming that every character with something extraordinary in their backstory is automatically a Mary Sue. It is okay to make your character a little bit special, especially in 1x1 roleplays. They can be a prince who is exiled from his kingdom, an orphan with special abilities, a mermaid looking for a way into the world of the humans, or someone who is mentioned in an ancient prophecy. It is also okay to make them exceptionally good at something. They are one of the main characters, after all. This does not make them a Mary Sue. Just give the other characters a way to defeat them or be better than them in other ways and don't make them perfect at everything they do.\n\nMaking the whole roleplay just about your character or always winning every fight/having to be in the right makes the character a Mary Sue. Or claiming that every other character has to fall in love with them because they are so perfect. \n\nBut I see so many people that claim that they immediately noticed that a roleplay was full of Mary Sues, just because other people had some innocent stuff in their character profiles, without reading any of the character interactions. Or who call everyone who writes vampires cringy, because a lot of vampire characters are Mary Sues (in their opinion), and how can you write something like that? \n\nI once had character who was a total loser, he wasn't good at the task he was assigned, he was an okay fighter but not better than the other characters in the roleplay. But I also added a part where he had already noticed that another character was most likely the 'chosen one', even though he was not sure of this (he had spent a lot of time with this character already, and had noticed some things that were a little bit weird about them). I had talked to the writer of the other character beforehand and she agreed that this would make things more interesting. \n\nAnd because my character was right with this assumption, someone else in the server approached me to tell me that my character is totally overpowered and a Gary Sue, because he knew something everyone else did not. Even though my character had literally just this one tiny thing that made him 'special' in a way, and was otherwise just a normal dude. It did not even take special abilities to figure that out, he was just lucky. And it wasn't even going to play a huge role in the roleplay, because some other characters were supposed to figure it out soon anyway.\n\nThis stuff annoys so much.",

This is fine and nice when they initiate conversations, but when they don't, how is one supposed to actually be polite?\n\nAny kind of communication with someone who is, in some way, set as 'leave me alone' seems kind of pushy to me, and I suspect it is just a 'nonconfrontational' way to ignore people they don't want to talk to, anyway.\n\nIs there some 'good' way to handle this? Why do people do it? Every time I get someone who exhibits this behaviour, even if everything seems great when I *do* talk to them, things seem to stagnate for ages until I just give up - which is, perhaps, their intention.\n\nThoughts?",

No, you don't need to know my S.O.'s name or what city I live in or what I do for a living. \n\nI've noticed a recent uptick in this sort of thing the past few years, it just seems like RPers are way too intimately involved in each other's personal lives and it's really turned me away from groups! That's not to say it isn't prevalent in 1x1 situations, either. I **always** state that I prefer to stay anonymous, and yet just last night I had someone tell me that I wasn't going to work as a partner because I wouldn't share pictures of myself or personal details.

It made me very happy considering that most people I encounter don't do that anymore. But don't entice me with all of of that just to ghost me.  \n\n If you're going to to ghost me, do me a favor and do it before you drag me through plotting a whole setup that I fall in love with.  Before I'm invested. Don't put me through an entire day and a half of back and forth plotting an awesome storyline for our characters and then go dark for four days without saying anything.  Don't act super invested and then bail. Especially don't make me throw up a starter after all of that and then leave me hanging. Literally what was the point of it all? \n\nAlso, what is up with people expecting to me to carry the entire burden of communicating period? I don't want to be the only one prodding because it makes me feel like a pest.  It makes me feel like I'm pressuring people to write, which I don't like which is why I waited three days before saying  'oh btw, are we going to start writing?'\n\nYes, I know. It's a hobby. First world problems. Ect. . But I really just don't get these kinds of players or what's in their heads. It's not even like I approach them. They approach me.  I think the worst part other than it's just rude is that I don't get the logic.\n\nThe only good thing to come out of this is another player saw my starter and liked it. So thanks for indirectly helping me spot someone who might want to actually write with me. But damn. I know I'm not 'owed' anything from internet strangers. But this person surely wasn't owed the time they wasted.\n\ntl;dr Don't ask someone to plot with you if you have no intention of actually playing it out.",
