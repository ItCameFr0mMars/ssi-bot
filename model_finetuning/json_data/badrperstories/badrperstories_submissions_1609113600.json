It was a superhero role play and she typed out paragraphs and seemed really interested in my prompt, even creating her own alien race. She was playing an alien princess hiding amongst humans on Earth, but using her abilities when the time called for it. We didn't really get far into it. I've been waiting for her to get back on discord for a while but that wait has gotten longer and longer. I've been wanting to find a replacement for a little bit but I'm just to nervous to do so. Especially with previous experience of having people give little to no effort for a role play.\n\nShould I just give up and try to see if someone can pick up where she left off? And if so, where can I even find people to take her place?",

I\u2019m flattered and grateful when people take the time to show their support. I think it\u2019s wonderful and makes my day!\n\nI just wonder if maybe people get intimidated by upvotes? Do they think I must have gotten a response or something? Do they just appreciate my post even if it isn\u2019t their thing?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a heavy-hearted rant really, just wondering if anyone has been in this spot before.

I've been RPing in different mediums for over a decade now and it has been one of the biggest hobbies I have. I don't know what has happened over the past year and a half, but I've noticed that I became the guy who ghosts when I lose interest in a story, which never really happened before.\n\nEssentially, I am in a circle of getting a good prompt, creating a character, background, then when I find an rpers, eventually I lose interest in the rp. For the longest time, I thought I was just getting partners who weren't contributing, but I recently came to the conclusion that it is just me. I lose interest in a story and I don't know why.\n\nI post, RP for two weeks, then lose interest and end up ghosting. Trying to work with my partner doesn't help me since once I lose interest, I've lost interest completely. How I haven't ended up on this subreddit, I don't know since that would be completely justified.\n\nI never was like this, but here I am and it kind of makes me gun shy when I get a good idea since I don't want to get someone else invested just to ghost or lose interest, since that is kind of shitty. Has anyone else had this? Does anyone know any solutions? My job runs me ragged and I work a bunch of different/long hours, but that never mattered before. I don't know what changed exactly, but something did.",

Back before discord RP was huge we used to have an In Character Chat where they were possibly one of the most CREATIVE people to exist. I mean their OCs were fire. I was in love with them and most of the time we always had our OCs as mates/in a relationship. I didn\u2019t think anything of it because I was young and so were they and NSFW stuff like that was new. Fast forward to now\u2014 I am the owner of a similar server where we chat as our OCS. I decide to invite them because I assumed they would have the most amazing OCs in the universe but I was very, very wrong. Upon joining they harassed 3 of the members asking for relationships, NSFW rp and had no character build. Actually, everytime they made an OC they would simply say they COULDN\u2019T build their character because they didn\u2019t have a relationship with someone else. Mind you, my server is PRETTY DETAILED. Literally people join and just start hashing out background stories, creating their own plots, etc to develop their OCs. This also leads to character relationships developing. It was a bit odd at first, we brushed it off. But now it\u2019s to a point where they will beg, literally BEG people to be in relationships with their OCs, do NSFW and if we\u2019re doing self plots or group plots they\u2019ll (they as in their OC they are typing as) bombard the plot with random stuff like \u201cHahah....I\u2019m so ugly...wish someone would love me...\u201d \n\u201cOh no I was just dumped....anyone want to come over and comfort me.\u201d \n\nLike\u2014 when I mean this is genuinely all they do I am not JOKING. I feel so bad because I like the small stuff they do come up with but as someone who develops my OCs, creates hundreds of personalities and loves building relationships with other peoples OCs, it just SUCKS to have to sit and ignore them in my server because I feel uncomfortable with the constant harassment but I don\u2019t want to be rude and kick them. I would like to talk to them but they have expressed sadness before when someone mentioned not wanting to do NSFW with their oc. \n\nAlso this isn\u2019t an attack on people who do make OCs for just NSFW or people who lack the creativity\u2014 this is mostly me just venting about someone who I thought had great potential in a place where we all have fun and since I\u2019m their friend I feel angry and annoyed that it went COMPLETELY south. Why must RP life be so complicated LMAO.",

            "selftext": "Hello. So I recently started a new account to keep roleplaying separate from my personal reddit where I often put person thoughts about things in anxiety subs etc as I never want it to put people off. \n\nI am highly anxious person and I don't deal well with rejection and I've been having a hard time lately with it. Putting yourself out there is hard but I try so i can get better. Of course as things often go, I get rejected often.\n\nIt's honestly been a hard thing to deal with, and to protect myself and my psyche, as I begin plotting and hear things that tell of drama I know i can't handle I got afraid of opening myself up to more rejection and I asked to end the roleplay.\n\nI could never ghost a person after knowing how bad it feels and while I felt guilty about it I knew I couldn't go on with the fear hanging over my head. I HATE DRAMA and don't want to be a part of it nor do I want to feel anxious all the time. \n\nIt is well within my right if i feel uncomfortable to end something. I gave fair warning and I didn't block or ghost. I also listened to the player's entire story and while I understood I couldn't deal with the fear and should not have to put myself through added anxiety. \n\nI honestly expected this post in my paranoid mind and feared this person putting out my information bit thought that it would be handled respectfully as I explained why. \n\nI am hurt to see that I was said not to have listened when I have proof that I did. It's such a shame that people can't respect someone's anxiety and fears.",

Since venting is fair and healthy I think it's fair that I should get to do it too.\n\nPeople make mistakes and snap reactions are never good and no matter what the reason it's a bad way to go about things and hurting someone doesn't have to be the intention for it to happen.\n\nI get that I made an error but I don't think it was fair to hear one side of a story told in one light and when you know it's you and you're seeing people call you garbage it's hard to handle. Snap judgment made again.\n\nI can and do always admit when I'm wrong and try to repent but since when is there only one side to a story? Many people ghost and it's terrible, but if someone wants to end a roleplay for whatever reason, it's really sad to feel guilted and I get that it's sad to bed dumped but even letting someone down gently is not good enough. While one person gets hurt on accident I think a lot of people forget people see this sub and say hurtful things.\n\nI was accused of a lot tonight based on and error and felt like I wasn't allowed to share my side of things and was labeled and that sucks. Even now I still feel hesitant to post but I don't want to be afraid to speak my mind or defend either, especially when things are made to look I'm someone's favor.\n\nI'm sure I'm going to get dragged again but I feel like I deserve to vent too. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Was it intentionally to hurt someone and do i deserve to be dragged on something one sided? I don't think so.",

            "selftext": "For privacy reasons I'm going to refer to this roleplayer as 'Chica' because at the time this all took place, Fnaf was getting popular.     \nThis story goes back to when I was in high school and not exactly a seasoned Roleplayer. More of, I was really fucking bad at writing, but hey, I was learning.   \nSo basically I had this character that used to be a security guard. This guy was doing his job one night when a meteor fell near his office so he went to check it out. He ended up getting possessed by this entity made up of light and basically had to share his body with this thing now. This gave him superpowers like flight, a greater understanding of the cosmos and he can firing energy beams. Also his hair and eye colour changed because why not? So all of his feelings were shared with this creature and he can control his body just fine since they're in perfect sync with each other. He doesn't show emotion because he's too busy experiencing another level of reality with the primordial being so when he talks it's usually very blunt and owlish. His expression is kinda blank now.  \n\nChica had this character called Rose and both my character and Rose worked in a secret government organisation that worked with extraterrestrial beings.   \n\nSo one day the two of them have to team up for a mission to fight this cosmic horror that showed up.   This thing sends them to another universe where they're still kind of in their own world, but on a different conscious. Basically, they can't see or interact with people from the regular dimension and vice-versa (just think Silent Hill logic).   \n\nWell, before they can even begin to come up with a plan Rose out of nowhere pulls a gun on my character declaring, \u201cWe're alone? Good. Now I can finish this!\u201d   This shocked me. I knew Chica's character hated everything not human, which is her edge but I didn't expect her to try and murder my character.   \n\nI decided to play along for a while when suddenly Rose starts pulling out all this nonsense about how the entity living inside of my character is killing him and taking full control over his body.   I should have said something there, but I really don't like confrontation so I told myself this is just what her character thinks and my character had to convince her to stop trying to kill him. \n\nThere's a huge roller coaster of events that takes place until it all comes to a screeching halt when Rose convinces the entity to use her body instead. And she writes that it LEAVES my character's body and possesses her and she freaking kills it on the inside.   \n\nFeeling pissed I write my character mourning the loss of it and asking her why she did it. My character had no one before this being and he was dealing with huge amounts of depression and was suicidal so it all came flooding back. WELL, Chica gets fucking hysterical, yelling at me, asking why he's not thanking her. I shoot back that \u201cNo, the entity wasn't draining my character, they were sharing a body. You just changed everything.\u201d Frustrated, Chica starts pointing out all of my character's flaws and how 'that thing took away his emotions so it's obviously evil. Your character makes no sense!'. By this point, I was done with the RP and feeling really bad. I ended up dropping this character all together because of it.   \n\nI have a few more stories regarding RP's with this person if anyone wants to hear them, but right now this post is getting a bit long.   Let me know what you think and suggest what I should've done. I'd really like to hear your opinions.   Thanks for reading! It means a lot.",

            "selftext": "So first time poster here, longtime lurker. Reading some of these stories here brought back a couple memories that very nearly turned me off from role-playing in general. I'm also on mobile so I do apologize if the formatting turns out funny. \n\nThese two instances took place with the same Roleplayer about seven or eight years back on Deviantart when I first started Rping in the Halo universe. I was maybe 18-19 and was still very new to all of it and was working on fleshing out my character and was also kind of getting into Pacific Rim when that movie was released. \n\nI was very, very new to NSFW content and rolling through that kind of thread. I wasn't exactly comfortable with it but my Rp partner at the time, we'll call D, didn't seem to overly care especially as I was rather hesitant partaking in such scenes. I didn't want to be a party pooper and didn't really know how to speak up when things like this happened so when he had his character in one scene during our Halo RP taking part in some... rather adult content by himself and had my character walk in on him which I didn't really care for but like I said before, I didn't know how to really speak up during these kinds of instances. He had also used my character for sex quite often which definitely wasn't what I wanted for her and I slowly let that thread die off. \n\nI had suggested another thread, one taking place during Pacific Rim and had our jaeger pilots meet up and when they linked up for the first time, he wrote in how my pilot saw everything in his mind via neural handshake that he wanted to do to her in explicit detail. That's when it kinda dawned on me that this really wasn't going to change (ran into two or three other instances of this with three separate people after him) and let that thread die off as well. I was really disappointed because I thought it was going to be really fun to roleplay as these badass jaeger pilots but D had other plans. \n\nLooking back on it now, he was probably lonely and looking for a girlfriend or someone to fulfill those fantasies with, despite thirsting hard after my characters, and went about it in kind of the wrong way? I've gotten so much better at voicing concerns because I really do not fancy going through something like that again. My characters aren't strictly for sex. I want to have fun and go on adventures and whatnot. That's why I roleplay and I'm glad I didn't let those experience ruin this hobby of mine.",

            "selftext": "A combo post of \"my bad\", rant and WTF, as I went over an old chat I'd set up back in the beginning of the year in a large, fairly active amino (I know, I know, but I like amino despite it's glaring moderation issues and age gap problems). I know some of it is my fault, but I don't feel I lost too much because the people I was playing with were what I deem \"passive\" RPers--or rather, one was, the other was my friend who was just as busy as I was.\n\nSo anyway, I'd built a chat as an experimental area for a sci-fi idea I had and to test run a custom alien race I'd developed in a fever of artistic insanity. This was around January or February of this year (if that tells you anything) when it started to pick up at all, but over all the chat only drew in maybe 5 people total and only one that wasn't my IRL friend even tried at all. Probably my mistake for assuming a low number of sci-fi chats in this community was because no one made them, not because it was unpopular as a genre.\n\nSo I tried, and I set up chat rules, blah blah blah. My friend, Lily, joins up, and two others pop in. One joins and then just... doesn't do anything, the other seems super stoked to be in a \"well-made chat\" and gave a lot of kudos for how it was fleshed out--which I'm glad for, but I didn't think it was that flashy? Then again, knowing amino, it probably was, and we talk a bit OOC about the setting and share wikis. I wasn't being a hardass on what could or couldn't appear in this setting, as long as it stayed true to the sci-fi theme in some way.\n\nMy first... flag, maybe?--Was the sole not-Lily RPer that talked at all, B, first wanted his character (also just B for simplicity) to have a classic car from the 80s or 90s and I thought, \"Well... maybe?\" so I gave him a bit of a summary how that would work. The setting was 1,000 years in the future but technology had hit a few snags because the aliens we encountered basically said, \"You need to fix the damage you did to your planet before you even think we're gonna let you colonize OTHER planets,\" so most advances went into being eco-friendly and stuff instead of running on the fast track to dystopian cyber-punk future. Still not sure why a classic car would be in the future but meh.\n\nBecause of this, I explained it would have to be an aesthetic choice on a modern build because honestly, I don't see how a car made in 1990 would make it to the year 3000 without being ridiculously expensive, but that was fine, no arguments or anything. The chat rolled on, but didn't get very far...\n\nB wasn't a bad RPer or character necessarily, but I don't think our styles would have worked out in the long-term, as B was a bit of a passive player. Not the worst by any means, and I know I was in charge of setting the scene and all because it was my chat, and I gave hearty responses I think--not frequent, but fairly long, with setting and backdrop info or characters and leads, that good stuff.\n\nB is wandering the city taking photos with his camera, all well and good. I bring out my alien and she encounters him at the local park after some natural meandering. At this point, I don't think B has said anything IC at all, just gave thoughts and actions, but upon meeting my character his first response wasn't to greet her or introduce himself--he wanted to take her picture.\n\nSo... not bad really? Not in and of itself, I could understand someone being awkward or a compulsive hobbyist, etc, but the issue was B had no real info in his wiki that he shared save for some very basic information and art. I don't recall any of it saying he was an overthinker that's obsessed with his camera, but without any more context because the wiki said \"content empty\", not even \"WIP\", I wasn't sure what to do about it. He didn't really give me or my girl anything to react to, so I had to try and find something to push any kind of interaction out at all.\n\nHowever, here comes the \"my bad\" and vent part of this debacle: we all know what was going down in February-March of this year, looming around the corner like a cat chasing the red dot. At first, it wasn't a big deal, my area was pretty chilled out and I was on schedule with my RP time, even if my vibe was kind off put off by the one-sided interaction feelings (we didn't get far enough for me to say it definitively that B was super passive and wanted to be spoon fed, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise), until my goddamn coworker threw a wrench into it.\n\nWe'd gotten early confirmation about the COVID unemployment leave being a thing and my boss asked all of us if anyone wanted to take it for their own safety. At the time, I didn't (I regret my choices) because I didn't want business to suffer, and my coworker who was my rotation for the same shift (working the same shift but on opposite days) agreed to stay on as well. We were only going to be down maybe two people.\n\nBut then for some-fucking-reason my coworker decided he didn't want to stay through the lockdown and gave less than 18 hours notice that he wasn't coming back to work and taking the COVID leave, which messed up the schedule that had JUST come out and absolutely fucked my own timeframe up. I jumped from 30 to 50 hours a week for a while just to cover it, and that, of course, affected my RP so much I ghosted my own chat.\n\nRetail workers and college kids probably know the feeling of when everything around you gets super hectic and stressful and you sort of tunnel vision your way through so hard you lose track of days and suddenly, it's 10 days later and you're trying to figure out what happened. So of course, during this haze of retail horror, I'd forgotten to reply to B and Lily (Lily is also a worker and wasn't in any rush), but because of the chaos at some point B just left the chat entirely.\n\nI don't blame them. I'm pretty sure it ended up that I read or swiped a message away during a busy time and straight up forgot to go back to check, but even so I don't blame B for bailing on a chat that didn't go anywhere and I do feel bad I ghosted so hard on something I was excited for because everything fell apart around me and I didn't even think to say anything to them.\n\nThe next part was weird though. B left, the loomer left, but Lily was there still, and once I got my schedule back on track I did a damage check and decided to come back to the chat room when I had better time for it, but out of no where someone new drops in, who I'm just calling \"Nuke\".\n\nThey didn't ask questions pertaining to the chat, or even try to insert an OC--they popped in and went, \"Greetings Cybernetic others, I wish for you to join the Cyber Enforcement,\" and we went, \"???????\"\n\nWe took it as an attempted prompt and Lily responded they could do whatever, the chat was kind of dead due to reasons I already explained.\n\nThen Nuke says, \"I am not playing, this is your planet's end.\"\n\nWat.\n\nNuke, \"Let the destruction commence.\"\n\nSo we yeeted him out and blocked him. Still not sure what the hell was going on there but by their profile, they were very new at the time--as in joined the amino and the chat all on the same day and did this weird shit. Looking at it now, they seem to be big into Alien v Predator stuff and idk if it's related to their Cyber thing, but it's pretty cringe to see. Predator Prime, rule over xenomorphs, power tripping, feared clan--the whole nine yards. There's even comments on their profile asking about if they'd been harassing someone, but I can't see their actual answers because I have them blocked, but I definitely feel like I dodged a tactical nuke that time.\n\nI still feel bad about the oopsie-ghost, but trying to RP in a public amino is a chore at times... Since then, I've taken the original chat idea and expanded on it and have created my own amino for it to give it the proper attention it deserves, so maybe I'll drop them a line when it's fully up and running and has some substance to it... I'm still building lore so it may be a minute before I do that, but that's my weird amino sci-fi debacle. Not as intense as my other posts, but I feel better having said something...\n\nDon't be a Nuke.",

I am at a place where I usually am not during this time of the year, I have a plethora of muse/inspiration and I have been heavily wanting to write, even more so than usual. \n\nI want to preface this with the fact that, yeah, I understand that the Tumblr RPC is shite and that finding quality partners on there is nearly an impossible task. But at the end of the day, the setup is still premium if you want to reach a wide number of people, and I appreciate the tagging system. If there was another platform like it without all the flaky individuals, I would hop on it in a heartbeat. \n\nThat brings me to the issue. I've made two separate wanted ads and got some pretty good interaction with the posts via the likes. The problem comes when you actually reach out to these individuals with the 'hey! :) i saw you liked my post, want to do this plot with me?!', only to get met with what I've dubbed the plot n dash people who literally just waste your time plotting only to never respond again. It is ***so immensely aggravating*** and I don't for the life of me understand this practice, especially when it looks like it's going great. You're sitting there discussing the plot, bouncing ideas back and forth and then--nothing. Absolutely nothing. This has happened at least three times (I didn't even respond to one of the people who liked my posts because they ghosted me months ago on Discord lmao, so why on earth are you liking my post now); I am pretty sure that one person stopped responding to me because they didn't like the face claim that I wished to play. I told them that I was open to options, so I don't know what that's about. \n\nI legit don't understand why it's difficult to tell someone you're plotting with 'hey, I'm no longer interested in this' or 'hey, I thought I had muse for this but it's not going so hot, it's not your fault at all.' Why make me sit there and explain out what I had in mind and the vibe I'm going for and what character I wish to play if you know that you're not going to be going anywhere with this roleplay? It's disheartening especially when you get completely excited about your ideas in the plotting process only to be left standing there holding them by someone who doesn't care about basic decency. I swear this is a chronic issue on Tumblr, the people are just terribly unreliable, flaky, and low energy.",

One of my favorite partners to write with, and we just seemed to hit it off, especially considering she threw me a bone when I was still new to reddit by accepting my sub par first message. She was wonderful.\n\nAnd without warning, she's deleted her account. \n\nNo farewell message, no other means of contact, no closure. \n\nI realize I'm not entitled to these things. I know she had every right to do as she did. But it's upsetting still. I would've liked to know if something went wrong, or if life and other things got in the way. Just some means of resolution so I didn't feel so empty about it. \n\nIt's really upsetting. But I honestly want nothing more than to keep writing with her still. \n\nPosted on a burner account, don't want to be judged for prior posts too much.",

We had our own little crew, and over the years a thread series I developed quickly became a big thing with tons of people in it. This was the days of AIM, and I thought I had a pretty tight crew. All different ages, though the majority of us were teens.\n\nThere was one player who was in her mid-40s. She played a character that she had ported from D&amp;D who in hindsight was very OP (could fix almost any injury, etc) but at the time I was young and having fun so I didn't care.\n\nMind you, I was an annoying kid. I hadn't picked up on social graces yet, had little impulse control, etc. But we had our little group. Our characters all knew each other, and we had the one thread series I originally started go on for several years.\n\nCome to find out, this woman was trash-talking me almost the entire time. Reminder that I was a teenage girl, and she was in her 40s. Slowly, she convinced people in the group not to talk to or RP with me, and by the end of it I logged in one day to discover I had been kicked out of our groupchat on AIM. I was so upset I just left the site, and she ended up stealing the thread from me.  \n\n\nCome to find out many years later, not only was I \\*NOT\\* the only minor she bullied, she also was caught writing explicit scenes on an all-ages website. She bullied one person so bad they left the site entirely.   \n\n\nI'm glad to not have to RP with her anymore, and now I side-eye any adult that wants to communicate with kids that young over the internet.",

At work for example I take pride in the fact that I can outwork just about any of my coworkers when it comes to my station. I do a lot of superhero RP's and I have finally acknowledged that my habit of creating overpowered characters stems from feeling fearful of them being overshadowed. \n\nMy best characters are more grounded, more vigilante level around Batman.\n\nThen I start thinking; \"Well if my character just happened to fight Lord Planet Destroyer she'd be dead...hmm better make her as OP as possible to ensure that never happens.\"\n\nMost of my partners are actually okay with my OP characters, and we seem to RP just fine with them. I just personally feel like I'm avoiding what could be a great RP all because I'm scared of my character being seen as some nobody/loser when compared to a demigod being like Superman.\n\nAdvice?",

            "selftext": "Okay, this all happened about a year or two ago but damn did it get me. But, I was cruising around discord servers and even really literate rp forums searching for someone I could just make a two sided story with essentially. \n\nI thought I found someone pretty cool. He seemed real nice, asked me how I was doing, complimented me and all those little things that make you feel fuzzy on the inside and like you're doing good and that they care. This should've come to me as a red flag. Not because of anything he was particularly saying (then again I'm bad at picking up hints) but for the fact that he started doing this to me two days after I met him. He was out here acting like we were close. Real close. \n\nBut I was a fool and went with it. Because he was damn good at roleplaying. \n\nOn the third day I met him, he started more aggressively dropping hints that he wanted to be much more than aquaintences or even friends. I started receiving cute pet names and other endearing messages. He even went as far as to write me a poem. \n\nAnother problem here was that I'm a happily taken individual of seven years now and still going strong. So his advances were.. not hitting the way he wanted them to. That was a pretty big red flag for me too.. especially when he didn't seem to acknowledge any attempt of mine to deflect or subtly change the subject. I didn't want to be mean or come off as rude so I didn't just tell him off.. even though in hindsight I really should've.\n\nOver the next couple days we would keep talking and I'd try to keep focus on the roleplay we were doing. Eventually, my discomfort had risen to such a level I couldn't ignore it any more. I essentially told him: 'Hey, I can see you really want to be more than my friend but I already have someone to love. I like you but only as a friend and I hope that's okay.' \n\nApparently it wasn't okay. (this is where the nsfw stuff comes in) \n\nHe went off on my so fast, insulting me and calling me each and every damn name in the book. Accusing me of leading him on and making him think that i was single and available. All capital letters everywhere. Honestly he must've broken his caps lock. \n\nBut worst of all were his threats. He didn't threaten to hurt me any.. no he was threatening to kill himself if I didn't go out with him. Telling me how many times he got rejected and trying to make me feel bad. He was trying to MANIPULSATE me into feeling so bad for him I forgo my own relationship for his sake. \n\nI felt awful. It was the first time I had ever been threatened like that before. It was extremely upsetting to me especially with death of.. real people being a sensitive this to me. I can write suicide and death all I want but the moment it happens irl or hell even someone I know that's a completely different ballgame. \n\nThis guy kept going on for hours upon hours, pushing and pushing. It took a long time to muster up the guts through my guilt to just tell him I couldn't take it anymore and block him on discord and just abandon the rp forum he showed me. I felt awful about the whole thing for a long while and when I think back on that time I still feel bad. \n\nBut, that is one of my worst rp experiences ever. I have better to partners now and still look for more. Though with my activity I do have a few more horror stories too. \n\nI hope this never happens to anyone else and if it does, I really hope they stand up to the person acting all crazy.. because no one deserves to be put into such a position. You are not responsible for other people's happiness or for their actions.",

            "selftext": "The past few days have been really difficult. Roleplaying used to be my favorite hobby but as of late, it's become as stressful and hurtful as it is rewarding. I've recently had a role player lie to me and say that someone 'warned' them about me, as I posted here.   \nAnother roleplayer, after I explicitly told them writing a pregnant character was a sore spot for me (I have infertility issues), asked me again not 20 minutes later if I would reconsider.   \nOne roleplay partner I've known for the better part of a year has continually posted roleplay ads for a 'rapid-fire' and 'active partner' saying how they have so many ideas, while, at the same time, they told me they 'didn't have the time for roleplay anymore', as a reason to end our rp. (Yet they continue to post almost an ad a day looking for active partners....I can see those ads...)   \n\n\nIt made me feel not good enough for them, whether or not that was their intention. Maybe they just wanted to let me down easy, I don't know. I don't blame them in particular. It's no one thing.  \n\n\nI've just had some streaks of bad luck, and it's starting to wear on me. I have 3 wonderful people I rp with and talk to. They're all semi-active to active, and I know that's far more than most people could ask for. I'm happy with that. I want more, because roleplaying stories is truly my favorite hobby, my me-time, and what I do to unwind at the end of the day. But it's become a lot, to handle the limit-breaking, ghosting, and just the difficulties starting. I think I've become too sensitive, and too mistrustful and hurt.  \n\n\nI'm not going to look for any new stories, just stick with the people I've got. If one happens to come around, maybe, but it just sucks. It sucks that this hobby I love so much isn't right for me anymore because I've become way too upset by the ghosting and lack of communication that comes with the territory. I don't really know what else to say here. This isn't an angry rant about how someone was a bad partner, just my frustrations with certain aspects of the community written out because it feels cathartic as fuck.",

            "selftext": "May as well get this all off my chest in one go- it's just... Been a collection of little hits and strikes and whatnot, and after a while, it's built up.\n\n1.)\n\nFirst off, I've made plenty of posts looking for RP partners in the past (oh so many), but I get ghosted in... Two days, usually- I barely ever make it past the plotting stage anymore. Tying into that, I've had a time or two where I forgot to mention I do not RP NSFW (smut/lemons)... And my partner *immediately* dropped me like a rock. I can understand not wanting to RP SFW, but if you're in it solely for the NSFW... You could've told me earlier????... More of a 'my bad' than anything else, I guess. Still hurt to get shot down so fast because I'm unwilling to RP NSFW.\n\n2.)\n\nThe pure amount of times I've gotten ghosted mid-planning stage is starting to drive me a little bonkers. If you don't want to RP with me, *you could just state it outright*?\n\n3.)\n\nBeyond that... There are responses I get in messages/on my ads... Where it's clear that the person didn't read the ad all the way through. I tend to put a passcode/phrase in all my ads to see who actually read it, but if someone at least shows that they read the ad (even without a passcode- so mentioning specific sections of it) then I usually give them a chance. But then there are people that just... Say 'hi, wanna RP?'. And I just... I get so PISSED because *DUDE THIS ENTIRE THING IS ABOUT READING AND RESPONDING NOT JUST YEETING YOURSELF AT THE NEAREST SLOT*.- This has happened on every single one of my ads, save one, to-date... And it annoys me to all high heck.\n\nThis hobby is about reading. This hobby is about writing. This hobby is about having an open dialogue between people and creating a story together! Sending 'wanna RP' or something with less than a complete sentence feels like I'm being smacked with a hammer made of red flags (I don't respond to said people).\n\n4.)\n\nI also RP on Tumblr (yep, please don't kill me). And.. This is more just... I feel like nearly no one cares? I run a lot of RP blogs (eight to the date, one is a WIP and one is currently being updated). I get follows every now and again, I get starters when I go to other people... But for the most part, I guess I feel unwanted? Might just be anxiety/depression talking, though.\n\nY'see, I see everyone else having fun on the dash- sending in asks, making starter calls, sending starters, reblogging promos, etc., etc.- I tend to send in asks, like starter calls, reblog promos (a bit too shy to send in a starter point blank), but when I post an ask meme, starter call, or reblog one of my promos... Radio silence. Doesn't matter how active or dead the dash is, it's... Nothing.- Most of the blogs I run are OCs (save two of them), so I just wonder if people don't care for my OCs despite having followed/messaged me?- Although the same has been happening to the Canon multimuses as of late as well... So I dunno. Maybe people just don't want to RP with me/my characters, or have other pressing matters in their lives.\n\nDoesn't mean I don't get a bit saddened when I see them all interacting with one another on the dash, and I try to join... And get ignored. If they aren't interested... Why do they follow me? Why do they even bother?- I've seen another blog recently that made a post asking people that had no intent to interact to unfollow, and I'm considering doing the same across my blogs/soft-blocking a whole ton of accounts that never interact with me (and are not on hiatus). I'm tired of the follower/no-responder count.\n\n\\---\n\nSo yeah... Just... Some things from what goes on in my life as an RP'r. Could be way worse, and I'm grateful it's not as bad as it could be.- Wanted a hot minute to vent. Danke.\n\n\\[*And yes the imposter thing at the title was just for humor's sake, to lighten my mood what little I could.*\\]",

It\u2019s just your interpretation that you think is somewhat right isn\u2019t it? \n  \nWeirder still are the people who want to write opposite canon characters with their OC. Like basically writing a fanfic of this character you\u2019ve built up in your head? I often see ads asking for this where the other person states they don\u2019t double, or won\u2019t play other characters. It feels like they basically want someone to cater to their character in particular, which feels a little entitled, especially if they won\u2019t reciprocate or play side characters or anything. Which I guess at the end of the day is their prerogative, and maybe there are people out their willing to do that, and at the end of the day everyone has fun.\n  \nBut isn\u2019t the whole reason doubling is a thing is because the person playing the canon character isn\u2019t really all that interested? So you have to do some quid pro quo so they play the canon for your OC. And there\u2019s plenty of horror stories where one person puts no effort into playing the canon character for one side of the doubling, only to be extremely enthusiastic when it comes to playing their OC.\n  \nMaybe there is something I\u2019m missing, but it just seems like someone wants fanfic of their character alongside a canon character, but it isn\u2019t as fun to write that without a partner who\u2019ll put in the work of writing the canon character so they don\u2019t have to.",

            "selftext": "NSFW and trigger Warning: Violence, Gore(not described), young ocs, may destroy your trust in roleplay partners if you\u2019re still innocently pure.\n\nI hesitate to post this, just because it\u2019s so bad. I\u2019m being vague with the details not only because this would probably be an upsetting roleplay experience to most, but I have willingly wiped most of it from my memory. That doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t still impact my roleplaying decision to this day, though. \n\nThis happened when I was younger. I made the mistake of roleplaying on a now-disbanded community with mostly younger users. I don\u2019t know this user\u2019s age, but when I first joined I was among the very youngest users(11-16), it was all extremely SFW(no cursing at all, no suggestive posts at all, etc) and as it became a bigger community the age range expanded (8-21+). I\u2019d been roleplaying on there since flipnote hatena went down, and I also roleplayed with some friends. This was closer to the beginning than the middle of this process.\n\nMy character was between 8-12, she was my precious little sister type character, she had the bits and pieces of my own childhood self and struggles with isolation, chronic illness, and anxiety rooted in not wanting to accidentally hurt somebody else\u2019s feelings or comfort zones, plus a dab of my own experiences with a younger sibling for realism, except this character I could give the happy ending and support group she deserved. A tiny bit self inserty, but shrouded in enough fantasy and magic that it helped more than hurt.\n\nSo the story goes, we\u2019re having this vanilla cutesy friendship roleplay based around trauma and overcoming it. My character is an orphan, an experiment who was escaped from a lab, and now has mermaid/water powers and a lot of anxiety. Also she has different colored eyes, one that\u2019s sensitive to light and air but comfortable underwater, the other a normal eye. That was fine until the older sibling character she escaped with was dragged back, and now the other character meets her alone, scared, and isolated because nobody around her knows her secrets, and she can\u2019t tell anyone.\n\nThis rp started out 100% wholesome. Another child character, a little bit of another character with a secret backstory, they slowly become friends and mine opens up to her...\n\n\nAnd then she threatens mine with a knife because apparently she works for the bad guys and is here to kidnap mine.\n\nI think maybe, just maybe, my roleplay partner may have been a little bipolar? Because this truly came out of nowhere. \n\nAnd still trusting them, of course, my character refuses and starts crying. Begging them not to do it\u2014they\u2019re still her friend, right? And they seem to be coming from the same circumstances, so they may feel pity?\n\nUhhhh no. Their character...stabs mine. Picks her up, and starts walking into the woods. Really abruptly, no out of character discussion, no chance to reason with them. \n\nUhhh okay? We can... we can still turn this around. Maybe their character really, really needed a big consequence realization moment to turn the good guy. Maybe the roleplay was going too slow for them? That\u2019s fine so long as we get back to the friendship and healing storyline\u2014\n\nMy character cries, in a lot of pain. Of course she\u2019s going to cry, that\u2019s her character. She can\u2019t cope with being kidnapped by her best friend??? She can\u2019t cope with pain?????? I don\u2019t know why I kept going at this point? Because it gets worse. Ahem, it gets...violent.\n\nTheirs threatens to kill mine if she doesn\u2019t shut up. She tells mine that the bad guys wanted my character dead or alive.\n\nI write, out of character (they would want her alive)\n\n..... (deep breath)\n\nAll I can tell you after that without triggering both of us reading this, is they didn\u2019t go for a quick death through the heart or something. Even with my level of creativity, I could imagine any level of technological advancement or magic to heal the level of harm that was done to that character.\n\nI wish I knew back then, that you could just quit roleplays that go beyond your comfort level???\n\nAnd then, they dare get to the door and tell me to roleplay the evil scientist character, after mine so dead. \n\nI get like one line in... and their character isn\u2019t distraught? Nobody feels upset?? It dawns on me that they probably saw my earlier messege and just...didn\u2019t care?? I haven\u2019t miscommunicated anything, I\u2019m not missing something. Maybe they were actually a dangerous person irl??\n\nAt that point, either way, I was too much of a confused, jittery emotional mess to go on. I wasn\u2019t okay with it, and I was scared of the stranger on the other side of the screen. At the betrayal of unspoken trust, the slow murder of my closest character, the character I\u2019d built out of my own vulnerabilities...\n\n:/ and now I do way more discussion before I jump into an rp. And I barely write young characters because apparently, young characters does not equal \u201cI\u2019m looking for a cute, pure, family or friends roleplay,\u201d noooooo. Apparently on screen murder is still optional in some people\u2019s writing books T T. Or, if I must write a pure young character, I give them a parent to go with them that will protect them with their lives, or it\u2019s a character who can protect themselves, that I don\u2019t dare get attatched to, despite knowing I will likely never be cursed with a partner like that again.\n\nI think I told them I was upset with them. I don\u2019t think I was upset enough..\n\nSo yeah. That\u2019s my experience with a bad roleplayer, my only worst experience. \n\ntl;dr They gruesomely pulled a \u201cI was the bad guy all along\u201d in a trauma-healing rp, murdered my oc graphically, and expected me to roleplay the bad guys after the fact, potentially expecting me to revive my character and make the roleplay even darker?????",

For one thing I had a few rules for how characters would speak (it was more or less avoid using modern slang and get creative with your wording) and yet there where a few characters running around throwing words like \u201cBruh\u201d and \u201cLit\u201d. One person came in with a Gun despite me specifying we weren\u2019t in an era where Guns where a thing yet. I\u2019m pretty sure someone made their character a cyborg as well. I ended up just scrapping any kind of Medieval RP and we stuck to Modern stuff, Which even then we also had a hard time with cause they kept bringing in random futuristic stuff and sometimes with no context Magic. There was also someone who kept throwing in elements from world war 2 Era. It was Literally a nightmare, I\u2019m glad I found a new group to try the plots I wrote with!

At some point though, I got more busy with my job. I could still chat a bit OOC but I didn't have the time and energy to post. Then unexpected family drama happened. Then the holidays came. It's all been very stressful. Amidst all these, my partner noticed that I've been on another manic episode. I didn't even notice it until he pointed out the signs.  To rein me in, my partner and my doctor decided to keep me off the internet until the episode passes because I do a lot of stupid shit online aside from joining too many rps.\n\nAll these events sound too convenient an excuse together so I honestly dunno what to say to my co-rpers now. I didn't mean to ghost. Lots of shit that I can't control happened. I mean, I told them early this month that I'd be busy but I didn't expect to be gone for almost a month. I'm kind of okay now and I still want to write. I also feel really bad about disappearing out of the blue and my social anxiety isn't helping. What should I tell my partners? Should I share all details? And if you were my partner, do you think you'd be understanding or would you just block me lol",

            "selftext": "So this was back when I was 18-19 years old, I had put out an ad with a bunch of fandoms I was interested in rping. I had two people ,who were friends, contact me separately looking for different fandoms. One wanted Dishonored, I shall call him Havelock as he starts out as my ally then turns on me. The other wanted a Marvel rp he gets to be Dr. Doom, Dr. Doom is the main focus with Havelock coming in after.  \n\n\nDr. Doom let me know right off the bat that he wanted to have the story have nothing but twists, turns, and be full of nothing but jokes. I did not and do not like that style of rping, I told him 'sorry this isn't gonna work out.' He didn't like that, sent me three starters ad told me to just reply already so we could rp. I tried to discuss with him and he kept sending me replies in character. I had enough of his bull and blocked him  \n\n\nOver with Havelock things are going much smoother, then he inserts himself into the problem with me and Doom, telling me his friend is sorry, he's having a rough time. He tells me Doom will have himself, he'll rp the right way, he apologize and follow my planning, please could I unblock him? I do, which was a mistake. Doom comes back and apologizes, however he wasn't sorry at all. He went right back to his shit and tried again to spam me with starters. I couldn't block him again until, I think it's 24 hours, due to the site's rules I was on. But the second I could, I did.  \n\n\nOn Havelock's end he inserts himself into the problem, again, by telling me his friend is just having a laugh and to go along with it. He reiterates 'He's having a really rough time now, just do whatever he wants to do!' I tell him I'm not interested in his friends ideas, and try to get him to reason with his friend. He gets angry at me and tells me and I quote 'Just reply to our rp, I don't wanna be involved with your argument with Doom' Dude you opened the door, you don't get to complain. Don't insert yourself into an argument, then complain.   \n\n\nNeedless to say both of them got blocked, after many notes from them both being condescending and rude to me because I 'Didn't wanna help a guy going through some rough times' as did the rest of their frat boy friend group who came around to defend their friends AH behavior.",
