Also sorry if i placed the wrong post flair here, first time I actually make a post myself here instead of reading others'. \n\nSo, today I was in the mood for doing one or two roleplays as I found a lot of free time just now and wanted to make it pass a bit faster. \n\nSo the first thing in my mind was to search for an rp partner, i get on a couple of rp subreddits and start searching for ads that catch my attention since. I found quite alot of ads that i would've liked to do along the day, the first thing i do is of course read their post before messaging them about it. \n\nAfter I read it all so I go to give 'em a message, they reply in a reasonable amount of time and we start chatting about how we want it all to play out like I normally would, until we ask eachother about characters. And from there I instantly get ghosted for no reason except one..\n\nThey tell me their character, then i tell them mine which is not the normal white character (Sorry for the generalisation), but one with a darker tone like myself (I do not roleplay as myself, i play as nonwhite characters only because I'm more used to them and feel more comfortable playing them).\n\nAnd then they stop answering anything else, until i crack and say a simple \"Just tell me if you don't want to roleplay with me so I won't be waiting here for nothing.\" to which the ones who haven't blocked me reply with \"Yeah, I'm no longer interested in a roleplay. Good luck finding another partner\".\n\nIt makes me feel like shit everytime not even being able to start the roleplay since it always ends at the character part. I really enjoy roleplaying but things like these make me feel unappreciated and unwanted in this community i love so much.\n\nI really, really have no idea what to do in this situation but just give up on trying to even roleplay with somebody else, if anyone has any type of advince on what i could do here it would be appreciated...",

Hours later she's giving me a lecture about how my character feels too powerful, she's uncomfortable but also she's super encouraging (AKA Condescending as all get out) about how I should work more on my characters, and put in more research on things and yada yada.\n\nI have 9 different OC's I can use for DC. All of them with different personalities, powers, likes/dislikes, backstories, etc.\n\nAnd as for the research part I literally put research into every character. It takes me at best 3 days to make a character because I'm opening 10+ tabs to research everything. Yet because I used a term you're unfamiliar with I haven't done my research? \n\nThat's what it was too. One of the things she brought up to try and claim I needed to do more work on was that I used a term she apparently just didn't understand. And the way she worded herself I know she didn't.\n\nAlso why did she have to send some gigantic, multi-paragraph wall of holier than thou text? Just freaking say; \"Hey sorry, I'm not feeling this character do you maybe have another?\"  \n\n\nYeah! I do have another. I have several more!\n\nSorry about that, I just needed to get that off my chest. Pissed me off.

No figuring out if I'm okay with their idea, or even remotely on board with it.

I love huge, roleplay replies. I put a lot of effort into the RP itself, but for casual talking I feel like;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA. If they're saying a whole lot, and I'm not they usually get the idea that I'm upset/not interested. This isn't true. I'm just not super talkative. I can be, but it's not naturally part of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB. I feel like they're talking over me. At a certain point I feel like I'm being spoken at, rather than spoken to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to be a twit around these people. I can tell that they're passionate, and I'm not trying to sound mean to them, but I get some anxiety around people who post 5 paragraphs of text every time they have anything to say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeed advice please.",

            "selftext": "Tw: Homophobia mention and sexual violence mention\n\nIn German 'Zwangsverschwulung', I don't know how to translate this, it basically means 'forcing a male character to be gay'. A word that I often read in people's description when it comes to stuff they dislike when it comes to roleplaying. Something like ' I am not homophobic, but I am against forcing characters to be gay if they aren't in canon. It is disrespectful and insulting for the character.' or '(character) is 100% straight and writing gay stuff with him is disgusting. I am not homophobic but it is just wrong.' \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not saying that we should force people to write mxm relationships (or anything they don't like). But these phrases still make me roll my eyes. \n\nIs it unlikely that a character who is shown to be in a loving straight relationship with his female soulmate (in one of this popular stories where love is meant to be eternal) would suddenly leave her with no warning be with some guy with whom he has no romantic connection with in canon? Well, yes. Sure.\n\nBut it is equally unlikely, at least in my opinion, that he would leave this beloved soulmate to be with some average Oc lady instead for no reason. Or that after his soulmate dies, he would just be like 'Yep, guess I will immediately start dating again and never ever mention my dead wife ever again.' Just because it would be a straight relationship doesn't mean it is more likely or logical. \n\nSo why do they search for this super unlikely stuff, while claiming that they dislike mxm pairings with the same character solely for the reason that it is not canon that he is gay (men can be bi, and if a character does not explicitely state that they aren't interested in same-sex relationships, it is not really impossible, in my opinion)? It is oh so wrong to 'force' this character to be gay, but it is not wrong at all to 'force' them to be with some OC lady even though it would be against his character design (when he is meant to be in a relationship with some other girl and loyal to her in canon)?\n\nEven worse when they act like making this character gay is so innaccurate and somehow insulting the character. While they themself search stuff like 'Hey, I am looking for (fandom character). He abducts my character, forces her to marry him and basically rapes her' even though the character is a good, heroic guy who would never force a woman to be with him against her will, much less sexually assault her.\n\nSo...it is somehow insulting and disrespectful for the character to be written in a loving gay relationship, but totally ok to write him as sexual predator when he isn't? Really? Sounds like homophobia to me.\n\nI just don't get these people. This is such a disgusting double standard in my opinion. Just let people be creative and let them write what they want without judging them, damn. Who cares.",

But that's because I get anxious and overwhelmed and trying to keep up with all the replies plus my irl stuff. So I tend to just retreat inside my \"shell\". \nI know it's a weird way of explaining it but I love to RP but the replies I get overwhelm me or lead to disappointment. Is there advice for people that kinda experience this feeling too? Or am I over exaggerating?",

            "selftext": "I have a new one!! More drama for you drama lovers, hehe~~\n\nSo this happened...today. And yesterday. Because I had to take a break to treat this person with calmness and respect, and every shred of doubt I could spare, as I usually do my precious partners.\n\nSo this roleplay had a fairly good start. The person seemed friendly and we had a long, long back and forth session to discuss the plot and get things rolling. I created a new character to fit his ideas, and planned out everything so we would both be happy. Then we started the roleplay!!\n\nRight away, he didn\u2019t really stay true to our discussion. His character was supposed to come close to mine and talk to him, to get his attention. Instead, he wrote his characters, more than one, banging against a gate and yelling from afar. It could have just been a misinterpretation at that point, though\u2014 he may have thought that was \u201cclose\u201d enough. I bent the rules and wrote a nice, big reply. He seemed excited to match this.\n\n... His reply took a while, and wasn\u2019t even a third of my length. It was barely longer than his usual, and not in the way that some don\u2019t write much, but write very well, nonetheless. This was okay, except he had gotten my hopes up. Playfully, I commented something like \u201cthat\u2019s not even half\u2014 thats fine... tvt you brought up my expectations though,\u201d thinking we were close enough for that, at that point. \n\nMy first red flag was probably that he took this pretty personally. I assumed I\u2019d simply misjudged this person\u2019s personality, though, and I didn\u2019t dare remotely criticize anything again. \n\nThe roleplay goes on, and his characters largely ignore mine, except for stating their own purpose like npcs bulldozing their way through their pre-existing script. As it went on, they acted more and more against my expectations. I wasn\u2019t sure this roleplay was going to end up anywhere if this rp went on\u2014 the other person\u2019s character had been described to be a dreamer, who would go from a rough warrior to someone willing to settle down in the ruined city his people had destroyed. And we had come to a consensus that their character had come for the sacred artifact of the temple, found out it was useless without my priest character, and then forced him to come with them. \n\nI asked him what was going on, and he told me this wholelly different plot line that had nowhere been communicated to me, where not only would my character not end up interacting with his unless I converted my violence-hating priest of my god of peace and prosperity towards the god of war and anger, but the entire plot line about his powers, the journey of acceptance I\u2019d planned for him after he lost his purpose with those powers, having nobody left to heal, all the lore of my character\u2019s temple\u2014 it would be for naught. And changed. \n\nAnd when I confronted him that this wasn\u2019t what we had agreed upon, and communication hasn\u2019t been happening\u2014Willing to give some leeway now, but not wanting to constantly deal with this... He deleted the discord server. I did get a notification for a messege, but I did not see said messege, because he deleted the entire server for that rp, first. \n\nI\u2019m not as angry, as his writing wasn\u2019t very detailed/thought out and his replies were never more than half of mine, so I didn\u2019t feel evenly matched as the roleplay dragged on, but It\u2019s weird someone would rage quit over asking for communication, right? \ud83d\udc40 Didn\u2019t realize that was so scandalous. But maybe I dodged a bullet... \n\nTldr; Changed the plot we\u2019d agreed upon without telling me, changed my own, highly religious character\u2019s mythology, and rage quit when I asked for communication on big changes like these.",

            "selftext": "(This post mentions IRL death and COVID-19. The title is a rough summary of what happened, not a direct quote.) \n\nI think enough time has passed that I can tell this story.\n\nAbout a year ago, I started a 1x1 RP with someone new. It started off great - we vibed enough OOC that we even started a second RP and had two going at once. \n\nMy partner would often reply within 20 minutes of me sending a multi-para post, and they told me to not worry about replying as fast as they can. I told them upfront that I could probably respond a few times per day after work, and maaaybe more frequently over the weekend. Since our RP was oftentimes 3+ paragraphs a post and I worked full-time, they seemed to understand. \n\nUntil August, which was an *extremely* rough time for me. In the span of four weeks, I lost my job, I had three family members hospitalized with COVID, and two of them passed. I live alone so I was extra stressed and despondent. I told my partner as these things happened, warning them that this would impact my responsiveness. Even still, I sent at least one post per day in both of the roleplays.\n\nUntil I had to (virtually!) attend the family funerals, upon which I told my partner I would be offline for a week or so to give myself space to mourn. Their response? **\"A week? Well...I guess I can wait a week for you to get back online.\"** \n\nThree days into that week? I got a message saying, **\"Hey. Just checking if you still think you need the full week.\"** I did not see it as I had turned off notifications.  \n\nSix days into that week? **\"Hello???\"** \n\nThe seventh day, I logged back online even though I didn't feel great. As soon as my status changed to online, they sent me a message saying, **\"Hey! Glad you're back. Do you think we can do rapid fire replies now?\"** I was still feeling pretty fucking sad, was still looking for work, *and* had also just been greeted by all the messages they sent while I was offline. \n\nI was *pissed*. Maybe I was taking out my frustrations on them, but I could not handle the callousness. I responded saying that I was still not in a good place and not feeling creative. (I also felt suffocated by their nudges and hurt that they didn't seem to care I had IRL shit happening, but didn't say so b/c I didn't want to make them feel bad.) As such, I didn't want to continue either of our roleplays at this time and suggested we pick up in a few months when I am in a better place. I needed *real* space. \n\nThey immediately got angry with me, accusing me of stringing them along by only responding once a day then disappearing for a week only to crush their hopes when I finallyyyy got back online. They said they turned down other writing partners in anticipation for my return (I never told them to do this?!). I tried explaining that we could pick up in the near future, but guess what? They blocked me.\n\nI understand that it can be annoying to have a partner that is slow to respond, but goodness. This kept me out of the roleplaying game for a few months after that. \n\n**TL;DR:** I experienced the typical pandemic tragedies (family deaths, unemployment, physical loneliness), warned my partner it would impact my responsiveness, and they grew impatient. I got fed up and temporarily ended our RPs. They accused me of stringing them along, tried to guilt trip me, and blocked me before I could say anything.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I downloaded Kik (first mistake) and joined this roleplay group to see if my previous experience was just bad because of bad roleplayers. I get a few requests and I answer them, I got two weird ones but the other one is for another story. \n\nSo this guy messages me like \"Hey, are you up for roleplay?\" and I, of course, answer yes asking his age, sex and location because that's a thing in Kik. He says 27 and male and location to be in Europe and I'm like okay I'm 17 ( 18 in few months), female also from Europe. I personally don't have an issue roleplaying with people who are older than me cuz most of the time they are good roleplayers and aren't creep like him.  After telling my location he is like oh it must be late for you and I'm glad you are still up which I reply I'm gonna go to bed soon because of an early morning.  We don't start a roleplay because of that but talk a little in ooc and this where the thing starts to go downhills. He asks a basic question like what I'm studying and I explain but then he goes \"Can I ask you a personal question?\" (second mistake) and I say \"Yeah, might not answer though\" and then he proceeds to ask me when was the last time I had sex and I'm like wtf in my head. I say I'm skipping that and then he asks another question, am I virgin or not and I skip that too. I proceed to tell him I'm not interested in talking about my sex life with strangers online who I've just met. He is like fine and proceeds to ask is it me in my profile pic and I answer no because I have Rihanna as my profile photo and explain it's Rihanna. He then proceeds to say I look like her and I'm like did he misunderstand that it isn't me in the photo? I just reply like yeah it's not me and we are nothing alike because I am white she isn't and yeez what he says next. He says that he likes white girls and I get that some people have preferences but idk it sounded weird and I simply reply \"Uhh nice I guess?\" because what are you supposed to say to that? And now after this part, it starts to go downhill faster than you can say cat. He literally tells me \"I wish I could lick your pussy now\" and \"I'm horny\" I proceed to say this highly uncomfortable to me and this dude is like \"Why? You don't lick to be licked?\" and I'm there like is he serious right now? I proceed to tell him it's because he is 10 years older than me and I don't know him. He proceeds to tell me how he would love me to suck his dick and tells me we are just talking calling me dear which to I reply it's making me uncomfortable and I don't wanna hear about this. He proceeds to ask me if everything is ok because it seems like I'm off mood which I respond everything is okay but I'm here just to roleplay and not to hear what he wants to do with me. He apologises and asks what he can do to make me comfortable and I tell him to stop imagining things he wants to do with me. After that, I went to bed and when I woke up and read a text from him which says \"You know I massaged my dick today, wanna see?\" and to that, I reply absolutely not.  Then he asks do I watch porn and I just simply reply how I don't see it relevant to ask that and he just says because I have some and wants to send it to me but I say I don't wanna see it. He then asks me if anybody talks to me like this. I say to him I'm not interested in anything else expect roleplaying and now I don't even wanna do it because he is a creep. \n\n(I hate blocking people so that's why I didn't just block him because I'll feel bad afterwards. I probably should have done it but it's too late for now. Also sorry if the text is hard to read but I tried my best since English isn't my first language)",

            "selftext": "*NSFW warning* \n\nRecently, I joined a discord server where you have to make an introduction post to get access to the roleplay search channels. I posted my intro last night, and I got a few messages from people who seemed to think I would make a good partner. This one dude who messaged me, who I shall dub \"Steve\" for the sake of this story, was quite a gem. \n\nSteve and I agreed upon one of his proposed medieval plots with some NSFW elements - however, it's important to note that we planned a mostly story-based plot with good amount of development, and this was not going to be a smut scene after smut scene type of deal. This will come up in my reasoning later as to why Stevie boi thoroughly pissed me off. \n\nThe first thing that kind of irked me about Steve was the fact that he did not appreciate pre-made character bios, and would rather have someone make a new character entirely from scratch for him based on his plot. He brought this up because I said that I had an idea for a character that would fit the plot nicely. Even though I didn't have a bio prepared for my character, I did not vibe with that at all. Speaking from personal experience, I know that some people pour hours and hours worth of effort into character creation and nice-looking bios, so if they're relevant to the plot, why can't you use them? I brushed it off because as I mentioned, my character didn't have a pre-made bio. But if she did, I would have immediately dropped things with Steve, because I'm not about to make a whole new character when the one I've already made fits the plot. \n\nSteve asked to see a picture of my character, and his response was what made me think to myself, \"welp, this is gonna be one for the books.\" Steve said:\n\n\"Hm, not bad, but also not quite my thing.\"\n\nFirst of all, I couldn't give less of a damn if my character isn't  'your thing,' Stevie Dear. After all, she's *my* character. Secondly, despite the fact that this roleplay was going to contain NSFW elements, that certainly did not mean that I had to cater to Steve in terms of what makes him &gt;!bust a nut!&lt; -  that is not what literate, story-driven roleplay is for. Third, even if my character's facial structure WAS integral to the development of this roleplay, wouldn't it be a matter of what his CHARACTER is attracted to? The point being, I personally do not take too kindly to having to change my character's appearance simply because my partner doesn't find them &gt;!jack-offable.!&lt; I've ran into people like Steve before, but everything else that followed just takes the cake for me.\n\nBecause I was so invested in the plot and couldn't wait to start the roleplay, I asked Steve what his 'type' was, so that I could write up a small description for him without having to send him a different picture. Steve told me that he had a preference for slim and petite girls.............which my character was.\n\nHe then sent me two pictures of girls that had the same exact body type as my character. Granted, my character was wearing a baggy dress, so I explained to Steve that my character was in fact slim, but the dress could have made her appear larger. I still thought that Steve was an idiot because even with the baggy dress, you can still tell that my character has a small body type. I was only reassuring him that my character was still fitting, and he replied with, \"oh, that makes sense.\" Thus, I assumed that it was okay to play as my character from that point. \n\nBut good 'ole Stevie was not done, you see. He wanted to me to make my 18 year old character younger, as well as a virgin. Direct quote from Steve: \"She has to be a virgin.\"\n\nWho the f-\n\nOkay, okay. First of all, I was not comfortable with making my character any younger than what would be considered the age of consent in most areas. Second, what if I didn't want her to be a virgin? Would her having say, one previous partner make such a gigantic difference? Lastly, what we're NOT finna do - is straight up demand things.\n\nThen, Steve sends me the pic of his beefed-up, scar-faced edgy character. Did I have the world's smallest violin play in the background for me because I personally wasn't attracted to his character? No, and I didn't even mention such to Steve. However, Steve asked if I still wanted to play my character, to which I replied \"yes.\" Steve's response? \"No way you can use one of the girls I showed you? I like their faces a lot more. I just find yours a bit too plain looking.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I finally let Steve know just how I felt about him being so anal about everything about my character - not for the betterment of my writing, but for his his personal lecherous satisfaction, then I blocked him.\n\nOh, and another thing I'd like to point out, is that Stevie boy's preferred pretty faces? They made no goddamn sense as far as the time period of the plot went. Both of those girls were very modern looking bleached blondes who very apparently wore makeup. \n\nThanks for the reddit content though, Steve.",

(I like this username doe)\n\nI started roleplaying with this really cool user a while back and we went from rapid-fire back and forth responses to I am lucky if I get one a day or one response every three days. When this lull happens, I am sucked into various rants by the user on things that they really should be talking to a therapist about and not some internet friend that can't do a lot more beyond a, \"I am sorry...\" or \"That's bs.\" I am all for needing to rant every now and then, but at the same time, I struggle with depression and anxiety just like them and it can be a massive issue for me. What I found out is I could be having a pretty nice day (mental health-wise)  and I get messages from them about them being upset and angry at or about something and my mood just goes from 90 to -100 instantly, because it just is constant and it gets emotionally draining.  \nWe are on day three with no actual roleplay response, just endless ramblings about their situation and feelings. My issue with that is while I don't mind OOC talk, I am not your therapist. I am just a fellow internet friend that is dealing with my own personal struggles.   \nI get that we are in a pandemic and replies may be scarce too! I get that, I am ALL for that. At the same time though, that doesn't entail we have to be each other's therapist and venting buddies all the time.   \nI don't know if my feelings are valid or if I am just being a dick for being upset about this situation. This user is a great roleplayer when they are emotionally able to do so. \n\nsome advice would be appreciated, or just \"HEY GLOOMY QUIET YOU ARE BEING AN ASS!\"  Okay. Have a good day. &lt;3",

            "selftext": "One moment, you have extensive plots of the world or characters than *poof* their gone and you don't have the motivation to write or do anything but wallow in misery. This happens to me way more often than I'd like and it is beyond frustrating. And it has happened a lot more since I graduated high school. Ironically, it happens most often when I actually have free time to write and respond to roleplays and when I'm supposed to be studying for an exam or working on my classes... I'll get *all* the ideas in the world and write essays worth of roleplay content when my focus should be on my grades. \n\nIt really sucks, you *want* to enjoy your hobby. One that used to bring you such delight, but now you can barely write 10 lines. Maybe it's because I've matured and back in high school I didn't nitpick or write paragraphs in roleplay, but I wish it would just stop. Not only that, but whether it be original or fandom, I can't seem to find anything that actually interests me. There's the temptation to join something out of boredom, but that's not fair to whoever's forum I'm joining and I'd hate to be *that* person who leaves as soon as they join. I know a lot of roleplayers who spam join tons of groups than forget about it or realize they can't handle it and never respond. Just sit there and loiter. And it's gotten really bad in the small community I'm in. \n\nGhosting is so prevalent in the community, it's almost expected. It's worse for people who roleplay 1x1 because they'll be hopping aimlessly until someone doesn't ghost them or they find someone whose writing they really enjoy. I've noticed a lot of people have become very selective and require writing samples or will say stuff like \"If we don't click, don't take it personally\" And I feel like that has both pros and cons. Why make roleplay feel like you're writing a job resume? I understand that it narrows down the ocean into a fish pond by getting you more likeminded people, but having so many requirements in a community that already has half of everyone vanishing like the phantom of the opera on a whim, really makes it difficult for you to keep your roleplay group alive (even if isn't one on one). \n\nThe community I'm in has turned into literally everyone jumping ship to the next roleplay (which is usually a copy paste of the roleplay they left...) There's just really a lack of community in a tiny community that can't really afford to keep doing things like that? But somehow it works. It's like a large portion of the community is a bunch of Dory's from Finding Nemo, and the other half just can't do anything about it.\n\nIt's frustrating, and it'll eventually kick the bucket from it. It's already hard as is because the website used has done everything in it's power to seemingly disapprove of roleplay. And I wish this weren't the case because it's really grown on me? Outsiders might view it as just some dumb site, but I really like the layout of the site and the fact there's more than just roleplayers on it, writers, ect. There's really not that many places dedicated to roleplay and creative writing that are popular.",

            "selftext": "I have not really roleplayed that much since 2018 after I had a falling out with my long-term roleplaying partner. There was one period in 2019 when I tried roleplaying again for a month, but it went very unsuccessfully. My biggest problem is that I can't make any of my partners stick. I feel very excited  to write with them and then they disappear. It was a reason why I quit. I wish they told me what I am doing wrong.\n\nAnd as of 2021, I want to come back into roleplaying. A few days ago, I even tried one roleplaying site and made a prompt specifying what I am looking for. I got two people interested. One of them stopped replying to me in a middle of discussion, and another just told me \"we are not suitable for each other\".  Before this, they asked me what kind of a character I am looking for as they said they have a lot of OCs to offer me and I said \"please, share them with me so I can read through them and I will tell you who interested me the most, I really don't have a preference\".\n\nTheir response made me feel bad because I don't know what I said wrongly. Was it how I worded my request? But it is hard for me to describe what I am exactly looking in someone else's character. And I also want them to have fun in writing someone they'd enjoy. I don't want for them to make up a character on the spot.  \n\nI do want to go back into roleplaying, but I honestly don't know how to. Always loved writing, but writing on the side doesn't satisfy me. I don't know how to look for a partner. I mostly indulge in superhero/fantasy lane.  I have been roleplaying since 2005. And it is a one hobby that I miss.  It also doesn't help that I deal with anxiety, thanks to my previous rping partner. My rping partner would make me stress with replies a lot. And now every time I try roleplaying, I feel awfully anxious. Like, if I don't reply to that person within minutes - it will upset them. \n\nMy preferred RPing sites used to be tumblr and [roleplayer](https://roleplayer.me) me long time ago before. I tried reddit, but it is not working for me. I am thinking about tumblr the most. Does anyone still roleplay in tumblr and what kind of heads up would you give?",

Im seeking advice on how to start writing again and maybe bringing a character back that was stolen from me. I know it seems silly i still own that character of course they are mine somehow my voice as a writer has been snuffed out. I want it back, the ability to create again and let my characters out. Writing has always been a coping mechanism for me so understandably not having an outlet has been extremely hard for me. The character that was stolen also feels very upset about how things played out especially since ive had to cut things out and re write bits of her back story. What i went through was extremely traumatic for me i think thats a huge part of not being able to rp or write. Anyway, i really dont want my character being permanently out of use after eight years of work i put into them because of those assholes then they win. Can anyone help? I just feel so miserable not being able to do what i love.",

            "selftext": "Yes, it can be used that way. I've seen handfuls of people make throwaway characters in 1x1 roleplays that are literally just the face claim because they're head over heels in love for Harry Styles and want to have his babies (I cringe as I write this). But there are also MANY in-depth and amazing original characters who're not so one-dimensional and flat, but have intricate backstories, tastes, ect, that have nothing to do with their face claim and get skipped over. \n\nI've started a roleplay with a partner who very obviously did not read a single thing about my oc. While I love reading about my partner's characters and try to do them justice in double-up situations, I have noticed more and more people put less effort into their character's form and just slap on a visual image. I know it's difficult to write a lot, sometimes it takes me a month to fully flesh out a character and even then, I'm changing them throughout the year if they still interest me. However, when I put effort into a character you don't even bother to read, and I've given you tips on how to improve your own oc...It just sucks man. Face claims shouldn't be used like this. This is exactly why a lot of roleplayers dislike face claims.\n\n For some reason, there's a huge divide between people who do use face claims and don't, and they all have varying opinions. Some are appalled at the thought of using them and others think it's awkward to use certain ones. While I agree with the latter, I truly don't understand why some roleplayers who shrivel in disgust at the thought of a face claim, even if the character isn't one-dimensional, but if I put it into question: \"If you had to pick an actor to portray your character in a film or TV show, who would you pick?\" Nobody would bat an eye, but god forbid I use a face claim as reference. \n\n For those of us who can't draw or are uncomfortable with showing our drawings, face claims are a terrific way to visualize our characters and get other people to understand better what they look like. I've had someone tell me \"Face claims are just lazy writing.\" When they aren't. They're *visual references*. Not all of us just use a face claim, some of us actually like to describe our characters physical appearance in writing, but find the assistance of a physical face to be extremely helpful for ourselves and others. When I used to write out my character's appearance in paragraphs, I quickly found out nobody actually read them. A lot of roleplayers are very used to face claims, and that's fine if you follow the etiquette, but it's really disheartening when you write so much for a character and know your partner didn't actually read anything. \n\n So please, next time you see a face claim: Don't immediately think we're all lazy, some of us *do* put our heart in soul into our characters and like to use face claims. We don't intend to offend by using them. And our characters aren't a reflection of the face claim we are using.",

            "selftext": "Ok, so, this happened a few months ago in a discord server I'm in. We'll call the bad partner Addy. Addy is the server owner's sibling. It's a small server, maybe 25 people, and maybe 10 of us are regularly active. Before I start, I'll say that this wasn't Addy's first offense. They made a roleplay server that several of my friends were in, but they repeatedly abused the other people's characters and threatened to kick people from the server if they weren't active when Addy wanted. But anyway, onto my story. So, I'd been part of this server for months, and it was great. It was really fun roleplay. There was lots of angst, and nothing really bothered me. Addy had already joined and been kicked once, but the owner added them back months later to give them a second chance. They started playing as my character's sister, which wasn't an issue. The sister wasn't really nice so that gave me opportunity for angst. The sister even cut my character's throat, not enough to kill him, but to scare him. Because nothing really bothered me, I didn't say anything about it. So then I went offline to do dishes, and when I came back, there was chaos in the ooc chat. I asked what happened, but my friend said nothing. The only reason I asked was because I saw my name brought up. So I scrolled back, and at first it seemed fine. People were talking about how old they were, and Addy said they were probably the oldest. There were multiple people online who were older than them, and my friend (lets call them Rachel) said that I was actually the oldest, having just turned 18. Then Addy got all upset that Rachel corrected them and started attacking me when I was offline. They said that it was weird for an 18 year old to be roleplaying with a bunch of minors (even though I was a minor a week before, and a lot of the people were 15-17). Addy even said that if I did an NSFW rp with anyone in the server, I would be classified as a pedophile. This made me sob. I will only do that kind of rp if someone else asks me to, and only if they're above the age of consent (where I am apparently it's like 16 or something). I use roleplay to help me manage my stress and anxiety. Then Rachel brought that up and Addy said we were all putting words in their mouth. We eventually kicked Addy from the server, and it should have ended there. But no. They went to the server we all met in and started ranting about how we kicked them because they said it was weird that an 18 year old was roleplaying with minors. Then we all went over and told people what actually happened, with screenshots. Then Addy dropped it for awhile. Then they brought it up in the main chat several times and refused to go to dm's or the venting channel to do it peacefully because they claimed they'd get attacked. When we told them off, they'd tell us to stop bringing it up. \nThat's prettymuch the end of the story. It's a lot longer than I planned",

            "selftext": "I am the type of roleplayer who loves playing multiple characters - at least doubling as two main character, usually a male and a female depending on my partners' preferences in the romance category. More characters means more drama, angst, and opportunities. Grapevines, gossip, temptations, etc. It's something I thoroughly enjoy implementing into a role play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, every time I propose doubling or even advertise with \"doubling preferred\" I get responses like that follow:\n\n* \"I would love to roleplay with you but I don't double - will you consider roleplaying with me?\"\n* \"Doubling is hard. I just don't understand it. It's too much work.\"\n* \"Doubling is confusing. I can't do it. Let's just do one main each!\"\n* \"I find it hard to focus on two RPs at once.\"\n* \"I do one main and I can play some side characters, but I won't double outright.\"\n\nI don't understand how doubling can be seen as \"hard\" or \"confusing\" but I do appreciate their honesty. It is as though having multiple roleplays going on at once, and I'm pretty sure they may have more than one roleplay going on at the time. I usually create different channels in a Discord server so that our characters won't always have to be in one place so that one pairing can be in Area A and the other doubling pair can be in Area B - so it is as though two roleplays in the same universe, and occasionally they will be in the same area to all come together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll even offer to teach them to double if they're willing to learn, but I then usually get:\n\n\"I only play female characters.\"\n\n\"I only do heterosexual pairings where I play female so if I can play both females, sure!\"\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\nAnd the rare, \"I only play male characters.\" Which is not what I want either. I like playing males and females. It keeps me in practice.\n\nHowever, when I do find someone willing to play multiple characters they want to play 10 characters each. That's a bit much for me. I can probably do four characters each at most. Is doubling or playing more than one character a dead skill?  \n\n\nSIDE RANT: Why is it so hard to find GOOD F/F roleplayers with good plots and characters? ",

            "selftext": "There was a thread on here a few days ago that brought up an old story and I said I\u2019d share it. It\u2019s the story of my being warned about roleplaying with myself. This took place over a decade ago in World of Warcraft. Back then, most people stuck to only rping one or two characters. The lack of things like discord or battlenet meant people were less likely to know your alts than they are today.\n\nI was an officer in a small, tight-knit guild I\u2019ll call &lt;MAINGUILD&gt;. We didn\u2019t recruit a lot of people by design. However, I was in a bad place irl and was spending every free moment randomly roleplaying with anyone who happened to be around at the time so my character, JANE, was fairly well-known.  The GMs and officers in my guild all had one or two \u201csecret\u201d alts for times when we just wanted to play for a bit without any added responsibility. \n\nSo my secret alt eventually made friends with another little group of roleplayers and we ended up making our own guild. Over the next few weeks, we get some new members.  One of these new members asked in guild chat if I used to be in &lt;MAINGUILD&gt;. I said yes, but I still had other characters there. She suggested that I leave because JANE is toxic. She said JANE bullied her because she wanted to be the only girl in &lt;MAINGUILD&gt;.  She went on to say another member left because JANE said nasty things about his girlfriend and harassed him for not erping with her.\n\nI told everyone I was JANE. The other person in &lt;MAINGUILD&gt; did leave the game, but it was because he got a new job. I knew this because he was my irl boyfriend. Also, &lt;MAINGUILD&gt; was like 75% women. She started going off on in guild chat. It was a very familiar rant and I immediately recognized who it was. This was actually a man that I had once kicked out of &lt;MAINGUILD&gt; for hitting on every single lady in the guild and being an overall creepy dude. The end is anti-climactic. He logged off an immediately deleted the character.  The guild got some good jokes out of it, at least.",

            "selftext": "So, this is going to be a bit of a long-winded post, but it's been a long time and I'm ready to let all of this go and get it out of my system. It's 2021, and I want to leave all of this negativity behind me once and for all. It's *extremely* difficult for me to talk about this, and as a **trigger warning** there is **emotional/mental abuse** throughout this post. Before anything, let me just say that I have been roleplaying since 2004/2005. I started out with those shitty asterisk one-liners but -- thankfully -- I have since moved on to multi-para and novella writing. This happened in the midst of my para/multi-para days with a character that my own OC had been friends with for quite some time. \n\nOriginally, I played a female OC and the person behind the other character asked if I ever rped males. I hadn't, but I'd thought about it and I decided to go ahead and try it out. The character I had got pretty popular, I used a song as my inspiration and created an entire story and character from a song mixed in with the character's real life occupation which I won't say because it might give away who the character was. Our characters started to develop feelings for each other, but *his* character was taken (though their SO was non-existent and constantly ghosted) so nothing happened for a while. When they broke up, the person said OOC that they were going to take a break and they'd be back at some point. *Some point*, being the key phrase here. \n\nFast-forward and my character has moved on and another character has another thing for him. I want to see where it goes because the story is **really** great, but then the original person returns and some drama happens. I ended up choosing him, and losing someone that would have likely not ruined my life in the way that this person did. \n\nAt first, things were fine and fun and wonderful. That honeymoon stage, you know? I didn't notice at first that I was losing friends until one day a friend (actual OOC friend that roleplayed, too) commented on my status in a mildly flirtatious (hey, you look SO good) kind of way. My partner *knows* that I'm not ever going to cheat or account hop, because that's just something I don't do unless we're both okay with it, so I have no idea why they got mad but *boy* did they get mad. They told me I had to stop talking to them or they'd leave and never be my friend again whether it was in or out of character and I, at the time, was incredibly terrified of being left alone. \n\nThis was someone I talked to from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep, so letting them go seemed like a very lonely choice for me. I should have **never** made that choice, but of course hindsight truly is 20/20. I stopped talking to my OOC friend when I was in character and then literally the only person I spoke to or wrote with was my partner. At first, it seemed fine, but then things began to change and I think at some point real life and roleplay life blended together. \n\nOur characters were getting serious, engaged, wanting to have kids, and the more serious the characters got, the more my partner did to restrict me. At the time, I knew it was bad but now that I look back at it, it was horrible. Just a few of the things I wasn't allowed to do were:\n\n* Take a shower/bath without permission.\n   * If I took a shower and couldn't have my phone to reply, I wasn't allowed to take longer than 15 minutes. Doing so meant I would be blocked for 2 days, at the very least. \n* Spend time with my family without messaging my partner. If I did not message my partner at least once every 30 minutes, I was blocked for a week. \n* Talk to other people. My partner's insane jealousy forbade me from ever speaking to anyone else, even women even though my character was very strictly homosexual. \n* Take any long trips without pulling over to \"check in.\" If I took a trip to see my family that lived 2.5 hours away from me, I had to pull over every 45 minutes to \"check in\" and tell my partner where I was for \"safety reasons.\" \n\nAt one point, after our characters had adopted two children, it came to be that if I did something wrong -- for instance, I had to go to the hospital for an injury and could not have my phone for obvious reasons, I didn't \"check in\" for several hours -- I would have our children \"taken away\" from me for an indefinite amount of time and only after I made a heartfelt and sincere apology was I allowed to have any time to see them. \n\nIt got to the point that I wasn't allowed to *use the bathroom* without permission because I was so afraid of doing something wrong or taking too much time away. I couldn't work properly. I couldn't sleep properly. When I finally decided to speak to people during one of my partner's blocking/silent sprees, I realized what was going on. I met someone truly amazing that showed me what an actual friend was like, and I was ready to get out of that situation. \n\nIt took me a little over 2 years to realize the abuse that I was dealing with and putting myself through. It started out as a roleplay, but it ended with me having some serious mental damage that has lasted for almost 4 years since I left that particular partner behind. That person spent a year during this time harassing me via email, text, snail mail, etc., until I changed everything and threatened to file a restraining order. I got death threats from their friends. \n\nI now have a terrible habit of apologizing for literally everything. If I sneeze, I tell my OOC friends how sorry I am, or if I take too long in the bathroom I always feel guilty. Sometimes things happen to you, and you change. I look back at the time and I wonder how stupid I could have possibly been to have let all this happen, but just like in real life? It, unfortunately, happens. I was *miserable*, but now I'm really working hard to make myself a better person. I want to be happy. The people I have in my life now make me incredibly happy. \n\nIf you're going through something like this, or you have in the past, I'm so sorry. It can get better, but nothing in this world is worth your mental or emotional wellbeing, not even a really fun writing partner. Again, I know this probably sounds stupid to some people but this truly did have a last effect on my life but I'm ready to get it all off of my chest now with this post, and let it go. It's time to move on from the abuse and let myself be truly happy without worrying that something bad will happen. \n\nThanks for listening to/reading my random, long-winded venting post.",
