One guy (host) attempted to set up a new group RP when suddenly another member\u2019s parents both died in a car crash. Horrific stuff; this 18 y/o kid became an orphan in a day. As such, the aforementioned plot never got off the ground. Host proceeds to frequently complain about how he feels like a bad writer and he\u2019s depressed that we never gave his RP any attention... because the rest of us were trying to take care of our newly orphaned friend. \n\n(Unsurprisingly, the group dissolved not long after that. I think some of the members formed a new group without Host, who ended up going completely off the deep end into his own world of crazy.)",

            "selftext": "This post talks about anxiety and PTSD for examples. Please do not read if there's a chance you could get triggered by these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been on my mind for years now and honestly I just wanted to vent a little bit. \n\nAs you read the title, yes this is about characters and their mental illnesses. I don't have a problem with it and in my opinion, it can make a character more interesting and seem more real! I encourage others to give their characters mental illnesses besides depression and anxiety, (since they're overused but there's nothing wrong with it. Just think outside the box, y'know?).\n\nBut there was one thing that always bothered me. Something I don't see a lot. When roleplaying, why don't people show signs of their character's mental illness(es)?\n\nFor example, if I saw that your character has social anxiety in their bio, and they were completely fine in public speaking with others as if they didn't have an issue with doing so, no nervous sounds, stuttering, or trying to distract their nerves. Or if your character has PTSD and how they get triggered is through them hearing guns firing. If we roleplay and your character hears a gun, it would be predictable to see signs of your character hyperventilating, shaking, or something right? But your character is fine and acts completely normal as if there was no guns firing. I get that there are different severities of PTSD, but at least show something. \n\nThis has happened to me so much during roleplay, but mental illness is a serious thing. But in the roleplays I've been in, any mental illness their character may have has been ignored.\n\nNow I'm not saying that your character shouldn't have a mental illness. But if something triggers your character then why not show signs that there's something wrong with your character?\n\nFor me, personally, it really takes me out of the roleplay and while mental illnesses don't always show or come up, at least give me a reason to care about your character. But I'm just wondering, am I the only one that is bothered by it?\n\nThis post is rambly, and I'm sorry for that nor do I mean to be rude or anything of the sort!",

By this, I mean people who exclusively play top or bottom characters, a tendency for the latter. Smut isn\u2019t a necessity for me in my roleplays, but more often than not I find myself backed into a corner of playing the \u201ctop\u201d character by someone who absolutely refuses to step into the role or even attempt it. For this reason, nearly all of my characters are switches.\n\nI\u2019ve been dropped in the past before for asking, if we are going to do smut, if my partner would be willing to not lock themselves behind one role; it either goes alright, but some people get incredibly upset about it and I\u2019ve never exactly understood why. It just feels like common courtesy unless you\u2019re writing with someone who clearly states they only write their characters as the dominant body.\n\nI admit I am a people pleaser and try to tend to my partner\u2019s wants, but I always state in the beginning before any rp begins that I don\u2019t like it when characters are set in one role... and conveniently many people seem to forget this tidbit down the road and are offended when I ask if I could try my hand at the other side lol. I make a point to avoid interest seeking posts where people state they will only play \u201cx\u201d role in smut, but I still seem to find that those who don\u2019t forewarn are guilty of the same thing. I\u2019ve even had people get annoyed with me for basic interactions between characters of the same role (ie: a \u201cbottom\u201d having plain conversation with another, as if they aren\u2019t even allowed to have friendships).\n\nNot an enraging subject or anything. I guess I just get tired of it after awhile and was curious if anyone else experiences this.",

            "selftext": "Soulmate aus have never really been my 'thing'. I just never really saw the conflict that could happen within a universe like that to be completely honest. And the fun of romance is kinda the fear that plays into it as well, yknow? Fear of being rejected, fear of not being good enough, that kind of thing. And soulmate aus seemed to eliminate that for me personally.\n\nBut then, I had an idea. What if there was a soulmate universe, where someone PRETENDS to be your soulmate? They fake the eye color changes, the marks and all that. Things that are possible to fake, anyway. That interested the hell out of me when I thought of it.\n\nSo I made a request for it. It was somewhat vague, basically just 'I want your character to fake being my character's soulmate because they want something from them' but you know how it is. I also include that I do not like being bumped for replies. I said that I know when I need to respond I just get busy sometimes so please don't bump. I also include that I am lit/semi lit.\n\nSomeone comments that they would like to do the idea but they are not up to my level. I wanted to play the idea very bad so I was like \"Well as long as you give me something to respond to, then I don't see the problem\" and it seemed to work out.\n\nThey were a bit too quirky ooc for me, but that alone didn't make me annoyed. It's perfectly fine to be excited by an idea, and It's hard to really phrase how exactly it bothered me, but it wasn't too much, just a little odd.\n\nSo I start the rp with some paragraphs (I tried to keep it relatively short, like 3) and they do compliment my writing but stress themselves out about a reply. I assured them that just about anything they would write would probably be fine and tell them the format I usually go with.\n\nThey reply, following my format which is fine, but here's the thing. The characters are at a wedding reception when they first meet. My character's first words to them are,\"So, are you a friend of the groom or the groom?\" As a joke since it was an lgbt wedding.\n\nAnd then they end their first response with their character asking that same question as if mine didn't say anything at all? I was like \"Weird but okay\" and just wrote like my character didn't say it and instead just laghed at the joke.\n\nThe main, huge problem was this: They didn't write that their character was faking the soulmate mark like how I wanted.\nThey just seemed to play it like it was a normal soulmate au. They should have been aware that it was their character that was supposed to fake it because 1. It was in the request and 2. I started the rp and my character had no intention of that. They were actually really excited to meet their soulmate.\n\nOnce again I was like,\"Alllright..\" and sure, I should've said something but honestly I'm sick right now and not in my right mind. And since I'm sick I fell asleep while we were going on.\n\nI only ever sleep for like 3 hours at a time if I'm lucky even when I'm not sick, so when I wake up not a lot of time has passed. And I see the message they left: \"Are you alive?\"\n\nAnd listen. I can take someone not really following my idea and stealing my character's jokes, and being very rambunctious ooc. But when people bump me when I tell them not to that's an automatic no from me. Especially since it hasn't even been 12 hours.\n\nSo the rp wasn't going well in the first place and that was the last thing. So I ended the chat, blocked 'em. Moving on with life.",

If it\u2019s your choice, cool! Pop off! Go off! HOWEVER, I hate it when people try to ship with you solely because their FC dated/is dating yours.\n\nStory time: I have an account who is an OC in one of the fandoms I\u2019m in, and I\u2019ve decided not to ship my character with anyone in the RPG because it\u2019s my preference; our recurring joke is that he has a crush on a character only seen outside of the group, but won\u2019t admit it, but she is mentioned multiple times a day. I was having a grand ole time roleplaying him, and then this girl inserts herself into our group. I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s seen the show we\u2019re roleplaying, but she\u2019s one of those roleplayers that only ships with people that shared a relationship with a character of their face claim or their actual face claim. (Not to mention our face claims DID date both on and off screen for a long time, but they\u2019ve since broken up and there are mentions of a toxic relationship, but that\u2019s a rant for another a time.)\n\nDespite me mentioning that I\u2019m not shipping him in my character\u2019s intro, biography, and connections post, she continuously flirted with him and tried to come up with these situations to make them be alone together, even though he\u2019s expressed interest in someone else. It made everyone, including me, uncomfortable, and no matter how many times we asked her to stop flirting with him, she did not stop. (Also, slightly off topic, but this roleplayer constantly stacked one tragic backstory onto another onto another. This particular one was living alone with lots of money because someone killed her parents. Oh and she had cancer.)\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s out of our group now. Not because she kept trying to get me to ship with her, but because she defended a known pedophile and blamed it on her uwu tragic backstory.",

Our characters did not get along, but they needed a reason to work together and go on the journey.\n\nHis character was about to die. My character has a rough exterior but she could never sit by and watch someone die. So she offered to bond with his soul and save him. His character said he rather die and she did it anyway. This way they would have to search for the ancient magic (it let's you go back in time.) Because there is no way to undo a soul bond.\n\nHis character spends the rest of his time hating my character for doing it to him. Calling her selfish and a bunch of horrible things, he spits on her, and a bunch of other shit claiming that he is now a slave. The only side affect that affects him is that he cannot go far from her and he can't harm her. He said that he wanted to die. She refused to Apologize for saving his life. He had a family that loved him and she wanted to try to unbond. \n\nHe does nothing but cry, be aggressive, and insist on dying. He won't help her look. He won't even try to become friends.\n\nI got into argument after argument about how his character is intent on being miserable about the situation. He claims that I'm trying to force his character to be happy but insists on there being a possibility of romance. We settle our differences. Then he had his character beg for forgiveness... even though that's not what I want? I just wanted his character civil not servile. We constantly got into arguments about his characters behavior. I cry every time because I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. \n\nI try to have my characters best friend try to help him think positive. He claims that I'm trying to force a friendship.\n\nI give his character a job as per the agreement my character made with the man that attacked him. He claims that she is making him a servant because he is working in her home. Despite him getting private baths, eating dinner together, and him not doing anything she asks unless it benefits him.\n\nI give him an opportunity to see his family so he does not feel trapped. His family won't accept him for being a \"human's slave.\"\n\nMy character opens up to him about her home life and tries to make amends for saving his life. He pushes her away, claims that she cannot be as sad as him because he comes from a more difficult home life. Then gets angry when she does not want to help him anymore.\n\nHe admitted that his character is not going to make friends with my character if my characters best friend suggests it. He wants to do it but not because she asked him too. \n\nI just stopped crying. This was an interesting premise that was ruined by a character that refused to be anything but miserable and negative.",

The RP was great for the most part, and the community was lovely. However, ooc, it was unstable and I couldn't stay in that kind of place anymore. With that, A LOT of my 1x1 and group RP was lost. I've tried posting ads on reddit to no evail and have never seen an app or website that works for me since geeking was shut down. People are interested and then end up ghosting me half way through. Although I'm often busy and lose motivation sometimes, I really love this hobby. I'm currently working on my own server, but this won't be done until the end of the year. And in between that, I've got almost no RP scenes open. I wonder if I'm the problem? Or I just haven't found anybody that clicks? Any advice is appreciated.\u2728",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been roleplaying with someone for about a week now and honestly at first all seemed well. I wasn\u2019t busy or a the first few days we roleplayed but when we first started the rp I told my partner that in a few days my schedule would change. That\u2019s because my 4 younger cousins are coming to live with me. They\u2019re 4, 6, 9, and 13 so obviously I have to keep a close watch on them. Before, me and my partner would do pretty rapid fire responses but I explained to them that when my cousins arrived I\u2019d be in less frequently because I needed to constantly watch them. They seemed understanding and we even had a nice chat about how fun playing with kids was. This all changed very quickly once my cousins actually arrived though. I still replied very many times during the day but sometimes I would disappear for like 30 minutes to an hour to cook, clean up after the kids, or play with them. My partner quickly went from calm and reasonable to irate rather quickly. Whenever I would disappear for a while I would come back from a barrage of messages telling me to hurry up and telling me I was replying to slow. I tried again telling them that I had 4 young children to watch over and that they were my main priority. They just said whatever and we continued the roleplay. If this was an isolated incident I would\u2019ve just brushed it off. But guys it hasn\u2019t stopped. It\u2019s been a few days now of the same thing multiple times a day. I go play with the kids or make them food or something and I come back to like 20+ messages detailing how terrible of a partner I am and how slow I am at replying. The last straw came today when I read their message literally the second they sent it and immediately began replying. While I was in the middle of my reply the mean messages began. This time they were on their usual BS but also called me names.\n\nMy dilemma is that this is one of the best plots and most well executed roleplay I\u2019ve ever done. My partner is an amazing writer and one of the most literate people I\u2019ve ever roleplayed with. They\u2019re honestly an amazing roleplayer and we have no issues in the actual stories. It\u2019s just OOC that stuff gets bad. Their negative energy is really starting to get to me but am I being too sensitive? Should I really throw away one of the best rp\u2019s I\u2019ve ever done because my little feelings are getting hurt? I\u2019ve tried talking it over with them calmly but it\u2019s clear nothing is going to change. Please don\u2019t judge me too harshly I just need some help.",

            "selftext": "I'm taking a breath from rps right now for multiple reasons. The main being that I have a lot and don't think I could manage more, but ( while I'm still writing the ones I have) I have honestly decided to not look for more even if I could manage. As silly as it sounds, it's because of ghosters.\n\nI lost my mom three months ago, and I had always used roleplay as my escape, and since my oldest partner's were kinda busy I decided to look for a few more. This was right before she passed and I wasn't in as bad of a place, so I didn't get bothered the first time or two that it happened. I used to do group rps or indies where this didn't happen, and I thought the term was for dating apps tbh.\n\nBut then she passed and I sank in deep. All of a sudden the ghosted started to really bother me. And it seemed to be happening so much, which was odd because I know for a fact I didn't do anything. I'm never pushy, I do or say offensive things, so I wondered why it kept happening. It was such a dehumanizing feeling to be disregarded so easily and I had to understand that not everyone thinks about people or see people online as more than a username. Still, as i was hurting and hoping to get an escape, the ghosts began to matter more than all the people who stuck around.\n\nI searched on there different platforms ( reddit, tumblr, and even discord) but more and more, it kept happening until it broke me. I was having trouble enjoying things because it felt like everyone was going to do the same. It took the joy away and made my grieving worse.\n\nWhile I am coming around to understand that this is a life lesson that I can't try to run away from grief as well as that I can't put so much faith in strangers on the internet to be honest just because I would and that life will make it keep happening until I learn what I need to from it to grow as a person, it happened again today ( even though they claimed they wouldn't) and I let it get to me enough to make me want to say something.\n\nYou never know what someone is going through and how much something small to you means to them. I get that people don't like confrontation but sometimes it helps to think of others as well. You will never know what a little kindness and respect can mean to some people and likewise what can hurt.\n\nTaking the time for myself will hopefully get me back to the place where I didn't care and consider it the loss or immaturity of the other person, but I also just felt like making this post to vent a little and likewise say something that I hope makes people think before they ghost someone, especially if you already started a roleplay or said you wouldn't. Stand by your words and treat others with kindness, I guess is the message I want to send.",

            "selftext": "So I'm partially a bad RPer, mainly for ghosting due to the fact that I was uncomfortable and at the time, didn't have it in me to say I was uncomfortable to the person, because I always felt guilty for saying \"no\", and would inevitably be coerced into the thing I was uncomfortable with.  \n\n\nSo, to the meat of this, I met someone who wanted to do a fandom roleplay of something I was into. I wanted to play my OC, but already, they wanted me to change MY character to fit their ideal. Red flag one, but no biggie, could just roll with it and wind up with a new cool character. So I roll with it, but the person seems too...over my character. Their character noticing mine, being flirty and all of that. Red flag two, but gave them the benefit of the doubt.   \n\n\nThen, this person railroaded us to the inevitable \"ERP\". See, usually it's no big deal, as long as the characters had that chemistry, which they kinda did. And I did have experience writing things like that. But then, they asked to do a separate, ERP only roleplay. I was uncomfortable. Especially since they wanted me to play a succubus. And when I didn't want to, they kinda stopped roleplaying until I responded to the sexy one. Red flag three.  \n\n\nEventually I just blocked and ghosted this person; yes I should have said something, but christ, why is it always ERP ERP ERP with most people? I want to write epic tales, not just erotica dangit!",

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to be in for talking about this; however, I have a small complication and wondered if anyone had advice. \n\nMy partner and I have been roleplaying for a few months now. There haven't been any issues until recently. He's been getting tired of playing a character, which is understandable; he shouldn't have to experience burn out of an OC.  It was totally fine, and I wanted to continue playing my character. he seemed okay with it as well. And we went on our way since it didn't seem like a big deal at the time. Until.. this week.  He's been changing my character in subtle ways, such as hair color, personality wise ( she was shy, and now she's more bubbly?  I don't understand why he is describing it this way because there has been mean-spirited remarks about the character from peers. So it doesn't make sense.  ) He's also inferring on something that something happened to my character in IC without running it by me occ, which sets off a red flag to me.  I've been trying to talk about this to him but he's been bringing up Irl stuff to change the topic.   \n\n\n Is he getting tired of my character? Am I doing something wrong?",

            "selftext": "TW: pedophilia, nsfw mentions, I don't know if this post counts as NSFW, but it talks about it extensively so I'm marking it as NSFW.\n\nI'll admit, it took me a little bit longer than it should have to realize WHY social media sites seem to have a stigma against roleplay. And, well, really *every* site. Those that are meant specifically for roleplaying are often far and few as they either appear inactive or have limits to what you can do. It really confused me how quickly that essentially a messenger app (Discord) became the primary place to roleplay, but then it started becoming more clear to me when someone mentioned it, so the quick answer is: NSFW.\n\nRoleplay is widely known, or at least, *presumed* to more often than not delve into sexual territory and mature themes. (Guess fantasy DND adventures are no longer the majority?) In recent years, websites have been purging nsfw content to protect themselves from legal issues AKA minors looking at or engaging in adult content and being preyed upon by pedophiles. Twitter also aggressively cracked down on their impersonation policy, thus suspending accounts left and right. While some may argue this is censorship, I think the pros outweigh the cons and smut seems more problematic than it's worth.\n\nI remember when I was younger, I was naturally curious about adult content and roleplayed nsfw in groups tagged 18+ that wrote horribly raunchy and bad interpretations of sex (Now that I think about it, I doubt there were many actual adults in those groups). A lot of people are guilty about lying about their age online when they were kids, and I've admittedly done this as well. In fact, it's so easy to lie and have absolutely *nobody* question it. It's an issue regarding moral growth as I don't think a lot of youths realize how wrong it is to lie about something like your age. I know the thought didn't ever occur to 14-year-old me until much later on.\n\nThere's also the problem of the adults. Not every adult is a pedo, but quite a few young adults act irresponsibly when it comes to confirming the age of the partner they're roleplaying with. They just take their word for it and that's that??? Or worse, they don't even ask for age AT ALL????\n\nI feel like it's more troublesome than worth, but people continue roleplaying it. The situation is so complex and problematic, I understand why websites have banished nsfw content to the shadow realm. It's much easier than making it more difficult for minors to look at NSFW content. \n\nIf anyone else has any input on this situation, go ahead. I'd appreciate having a different view on this from another roleplayer's eyes. Anyone else I've asked about this seems to abhor roleplay and presumes we're all writing extravagant erotica and furry porn.",

            "selftext": "I've been scrolling through this subreddit all night and I can finally let out my frustration over something that happend a few years back. \n\nI was part of a small community that had like a OOC dc server and an IC server with small chatrooms between the characters. I had my character, a young man I plotted to be best friends with this girl that was really popular on the site even OOC. Like everyone was talking about what she did, it was clear SHE was the ~main character~. I liked her, so i didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nWell... here's the thing about this girl character. She was... xXBrokenXx. She had a hard past. She suffered from mental disorders. You know the drill. Everything. She was just so... \\\\ Broken \\\\. \n\nAnd because she was broken, she acted like an asshole to other chars. Of course it was ok. Because she was \u2661Broken\u2661.\n\nAnyway me and the girl who played BrokenGirl plotted that our chars would actually be interested in each other and hook up or even end up together in the future if it felt right. I write a RP with this girl and my char and my char tells her how he feels. She says no, she can't be with him, she wants to be alone. My char is like \"ok sorry\" and drops her off at her house. \n\nJust as he's about to go back to his car she stands up and yells \"ARE YOU JUST GONNA LEAVE?\"\n\nMy char turns around and goes back to her and asks if she wants him to stay.\n\nShe says \"I don't know what I want... I can't be with you\"\n\nMy char is like ok cool sorry I love you bestie but imma yeet out of here, text me, please?\n\nSo he leaves. Then she texts him in one of those chat rooms I talked about earlier. (In a private one between them but mind you ALL PLAYERS CAN READ THEM).\n\n\"I'm sorry. I want to be with you\".\n\nI remember sighing. Never in our plot did we plan for her to act like this. So I replied \"look i love you and I'm sorry but I think it's best we wait until you feel better\"\n\nSo this girl writes to me OOC and asks if we can write her coming over to my char. I said sure. She comes over and throws herself at him. They make out. My char is like \"this doesn't feel right but.. k whatever\" and they have sex.\n\nWell, here comes the real amazing part. She goes home. Times flies by. All of a sudden Broken Girl writes to me in the IC chat. \"I'm pregnant\". \n\nO-okay. We never planned this? I never said I was ok with this? \n\nBut I really liked this group so I disnt want to cause shit. So my boy replied:\n\"I will help you whatever you choose to do. It's up to you. I'm sorry this happend\".\n\nShe replied: \"you want me to do an abortion?\"\n\nHe replied: \"it's your choice and I will be here for you either way. I don't think I'm ready to be a dad, but it's your choice, not mine\".\n\n...so i went to sleep here. And oh boy. When i woke up. I woke up to three IC chat messages from characters my char has never even talked to before. \n\n\"How could you do this to ~broken girl~? You're an asshole. Slurs. Slurs. Hope you die.\"\n\n\"She tried to kill herself because of you. Hope you're happy\".\n\n\"How can you tell ~broken girl~ to get an abortion? You piece of shit\".\n\nI never asked for this plot.\n\nI left the community short after. I talked to the girl playing broken girl 2 years after. I told her how i felt. She said she was really sorry and I don't hate her or anything. But man, did that fuck me up.",

Honestly, it would have been good for her character development to learn to deal with heart ache and grow out of being emotionally dependent on someone emotionally unavailable.\n\nBUT ANYWAY \n\nSomeone in the group seemed interested so we worked out the plot. Girl with a crush on an acquaintance that doesn\u2019t work out. But I swear they flipped the script and acted like this was some middle schooler\u2019s Wattpad story.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s my fault for not asking about his character\u2019s personality but come on.\n\nTheir character was trying to hard to be the \u2018popular bad boy\u2019 trope. Basically bullied her and was rude and obnoxious and cocky and, well, you get the idea. Meanwhile, my character was the quiet romantic with her head in the clouds. You would think they would look and realize that she wouldn\u2019t jump to liking someone like that.\n\nIf their character had any sort of redeemable qualities, I would have tried to push through it but he had none. \n\nI pulled them aside and expressed my concern, saying that I don\u2019t see why she would like him in the first place if all he does is act like a jerk.\n\nTheir response? \u201cOh, but he\u2019s attractive, right? Maybe that\u2019s why she likes him?\u201d\n\nYOUR BASIC LUCKY BLUE SMITH FC IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET HER TO HAVE ANY FEELINGS FOR YOUR CHARACTER LIKE AT LEAST PUT IN THE EFFORT TO MAKE YOUR CHARACTER LIKEABLE.\n\nThis RP didn\u2019t last long at all.",

            "selftext": "TW: Mentions of non-consent\n\nSo this story is going to be about myself (OP), my close friend (Chloe) and another writer (Mary). \n\nIt all started when Mary had joined an RP that me and Chloe were on. At the time, I had just introduced my first character and Mary had introduced her own character too. Me and Mary decided that our characters should date, and we established a backstory between the two of them. They had known each other since they were young, and they liked each other but never acted on it. That was, until they had reunited and shared their first kiss. They were so cute together. \n\nWhat's unique about this whole situation is that my character is a hero and Mary's character is a villain because she's possessed by a monster. Chloe also had a character possessed by a monster, so the two monsters were teaming up and in love with each other. \n\nTime passes, and Mary's character has been taken over completely by the monster. Now the two monsters were going around causing chaos while dating each other. This was fine because it gives my hero motivation to save Mary's character. We need a story, after all. \n\nHowever, Chloe had told me that Mary was shipping their human characters as well. This was what made me and Chloe uncomfortable because it makes zero sense. These two humans are being forced to do things without their consent, including sexual activity. This is completely unhealthy! Chloe has told me that both characters should be traumatized by what has happened, and that Mary probably shipped them because it was F/F. \n\nWhat's sad is that Mary loved her character being with mine earlier on. She made a playlist for them, and I have a pinterest board for them. The two characters have even expressed how much they loved each other. \n\nUltimately, Mary did ghost the roleplay due to IRL circumstances. Chloe's character did get her own monster out of her body, and now she's in love with another character written by another writer. As for Mary's character, I took her over and my character is still trying to rescue her.",

            "selftext": "Buckle up kids, because this one is gonna be wild. Back in the days of yore, when Google Plus was still a thing and my preferred platform for all things RP, I was but a humble OC who barely knew how to string two sentences together. I wasn't a great writer by any stretch of the imagination and my character, as much as I loved him, was a disaster. I started out in fandom, as I know many of us do, and my fandom was Doctor Who. There was a whole group of us, a warm and convincing woman who played River Song, a whole host of Doctors of every flavor, and me and my sisters, one of which I still speak to daily whom I love very much and have accepted as an actual sister. Our River was a hell of a woman, and she'd pull other fandoms, floaters of all sorts and varieties, basically anyone, into our little group. One day she pulled in an absolute beast of an rper, a fella who played a villain in the Sherlock fandom, back when cross over for those two was popular. He and I got on like a housefire, my chaotic good and his chaotic evil was refreshing for me. I enjoyed trying to 'mitigate' his damage. That was until the day she showed up. He'd been contacted by an OC in the Sherlock fandom. She seemed like a decent rper, River took her under her wing as she did all of us, and for a few weeks it seemed like she and 'Jim' were having a blast. And then it happened, 'Jim' did what he did best and that's how I met 'Tammy'. I was simply 'mitigating' the damage. Funnily enough, those early days were pretty fun. Lots of adventures, lots of big, messy group rps. Then it happened, somewhere along the line her character fell for mine. It was kinda flattering at first, but it crossed right over the median into the oncoming traffic of uncomfortable pretty quick. Soon she'd show up randomly on any and all of my posts, she private messaged me dozens of times a night, and perhaps the worst part of it, she went to all of my 'sisters' and told them I didn't want to speak with them anymore. Any woman I wrote with, even if it was completely unrelated to anything fandom, she would try to scare off. I started dreading logging in. When I'd block her, another profile would just pop right up, different characters, different fandoms....always 'Tammy'. It was like I was the coed in a slasher film. I even killed off the OC she seemed so enamored with, but to no avail. Not long after that, the glue that held us all together left to pursue other hobbies and the group was no more. I moved accounts and thankfully, Tammy did not follow.",

We discussed what fandoms we liked doing, what we were comfortable with etc and decided on fluff. Then things got weird again. They asked multiple times if I had discord, I don\u2019t for the record and told them this. They asked then to rp as alternative characters to the ones in fandom using faceclaims. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not opposed to this on principle. I\u2019ve done it before in other projects before and it went fine. However they used the images of models as faceclaims and insisted we used these women\u2019s real names. That creeped me out and when I mentioned it I was ignored. Then when we got into the actual role-playing they started being sexual and I let them know I was confused/uncomfortable because I thought we weren\u2019t doing that. \n\nThey didn\u2019t get understand and kept pushing me to do sexual things. I decide to ignore them. A week goes by and I am minding my business when they ask to rp again and when I didn\u2019t reply insinuated they were going to seriously harm themselves. \n\nI, of course, was horrified and managed to talk them out of it because you know, holy fucking shit and later when I mentioned I was going to be away from my computer because I was exercising they incessantly messaged me asking about my body, how I look, am I single, where am I from, what\u2019s my phone number etc. \n\nEventually after consulting multiple friends I blocked this person but I still feel bad about it.",

But idk how to solve it. \n\nI love role-playing, writing, scene setting, the drama, the whole 9. But at times I just lose that initial depth, that detail and desire, and I can feel it cause I'll be staring at my screen for hours just trying to figure what to type and how to type it. For it to only be subpar compared to my early additions. How do I fix that? Can you fix that? Is it a curse I'm just forced to live with? Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you.",

Both Bob and his character would have rants of \"I'm worthless and you shouldn't value me as a person or be my friend\" from time to time. It got exhausting. \n\nWhen he joined the RP, our characters were close in level and interests and became friends. But time and again he'd take up his pity parties and going through the same exact routine with him was exhausting. I ignored his OOC shit and just focused on the IC but like I said, it was repetitive and bad. After the 5th \"I'm worthless and you're wasting your time on me\" discussion, my character just had enough and the friendship dissolved. OOC he was unhappy that my character \"gave up easily\" because he was expecting something else out of the interaction. And like, I don't know dude, but if after 5 conversations you're saying the same stuff and not listening to a word that's being said, there's no need to have a 6th and 7th. My character isn't going to fight *that* hard for you.  \n\nBob also liked to stir up petty OOC drama. \n\nDuring a big in-game event, he and others made some poor choices and the situation he and a few others were in got sticky. He got really upset and was throwing a lot of fits. The thing is that people were offering help and suggestions and he kept saying that it was all useless and nothing would work. Rather than think creatively to come up with a solution, like others in the same situation, he gave up and killed off his character, then was upset about having his character \"stolen\" from him. \n\nDuring this, as well as a few other previous kerfluffles (like people arguing IC or things looking a little hairy at times IC), he would start prodding other people in DMs: \"Hey, doesn't [scene] seem really odd and wrong?\" and if he didn't get the response he was looking for, continue to ask leading questions like: \"OK, but what about how GM is interpreting [rule]?\" or similar, trying to provoke a response of OK maybe something's off or seems a little unfair. Then he would run to the mods to complain about how: a bunch of us have been talking and we're unhappy with how [scene or event] is being done [blahblahblah] and many others agree with me, they're just too afraid to talk to the mods about this. No, you're just pestering people with misleading questions and trying to stir up drama where there wasn't any.",

We have written together before and they're honestly quite puzzling; you can never tell what's going on through their mind. They've brought up not being completely healthy before but this is not a matter of health but literally how they seem to always say the opposite of what they truly feel.\n\nA couple of times after I replied they displayed themselves unhappy with my post either saying it was rushed or that they didn't just like it for no reason whatsoever... and then proceeded to steadily reply back. I don't need somebody to tell me whether I'm good at writing or not but honestly I found it kind of weird you'd first go out of your way to criticize my roleplay and then just go on and happily live with it. They replied even quickly and with a good post, too. \n\nI don't know others but I feel like the better I liked my partner's post is the better / longer I can write my next reply. So it doesn't really add up if we go with that logic.\n\nBut sure, why not.\n\nWe proceeded to switch places to roleplay because our latest one was disappointing. On this one, they reached out to me and suggested that our characters would be dating; I accepted. And then? Nothing. I ask nothing more than small details and then they proceed to reply with angry emojis and be like 'I don't know! You figure it out'. It's like they want me to write the whole story about our characters but even then I tried to do so and when I did they began bringing up details about their character and shot down my ideas.\n\nSo basically it's a neverending struggle with this partner.\n\nI have been trying to ignore them as of late (because even then they're somewhat controlling, even with small things such as me changing avatar or whatever) and they're still sending small hints my way they want to still write a dating story with my character. Honestly I feel like it wouldn't go anywhere so I'd rather be avoiding them, possibly. But even then I don't want to really do it because I'd feel like an ass, especially since they seem like the fragile type of person to take these things seriously.\n\nI considered leaving the roleplay place but I have also settled for other plots with other people so I don't really feel like it as of now.",

We were basically rapid firing back and forth for a while, until December hit and the replies became less frequent. No big deal, I told myself, December was a hectic month for a lot of folks and I completely understand that it's when the holiday crap completely amps up and peoples' attention gets pulled away to irl endeavors. Totally fine. The last reply ic was from me on the 5th of December, then on the 17th or so I checked in and inquired if everything was alright and that there is no rush since I know it's a hectic time of the year. No response. Okay, fair enough. I believe around this time, I made the post asking what people on here would do, and many people suggested that they believe she bounced and the roleplay is dead. I figured the same, but I couldn't bring myself to actually go through with bouncing then because again, I adore this plot. \n\nI then checked in again several days later after the 17th, once more inquiring if everything is okay and wishing them a happy holiday if they celebrate. I didn't inquire again until this month, on the 1st, and then finally on the 8th where I pretty much told her that I can safely assume that she lost interest and that it would've been nice to just be told so. Mind you, at this point, I figured that I was typing to nobody because despite still being in our server, she hadn't replied to anything. So, perhaps in what can be described as a brash move, I removed her from the server and the friends' list. Because if it's been more than a month, you can safely assume that it's done, right? \n\nOK, SO THEN TELL ME WHY, as soon as I removed this person from my friends list, ***they immediately added me back*** like a few moments later. Bro, are you ***for real?*** Why would you do that, by doing that you basically told on yourself and demonstrated that you've been seeing all the messages but have been deliberately leaving someone hanging and waiting for some sort of response. I would've totally appreciated just being told like \"hey, shit's crazy with the work and holidays right now, but I will be back in the swing of things in January\" or even a \"hey, can we postpone this for now bc everything is insane right now\", I would've actually made an exception and waited because again, I love the plot. But this was just a smack in the face. Don't add me right back, presumably to give some sort of half-assed excuse. I still have the add, I am not sure whether I should just delete it or accept and see what they have to say. I feel like by accepting, I wouldn't be respecting myself, my boundaries, and my time. What do you guys think? What would you do? \n\nTL;DR: person the didn't respond ic or ooc for more than a month adds me right back after I delete them, therefore confirming that they've been seeing all my messages and just passively ignoring them.",

It would be really great to eventually get there but so many OCs that people make are so clingy and attention seeking?\n\nFor example, if i have an OC who is naturally kinda cold and doesn't coddle people and the other RPer has an OC who has issues and needs attention.. realistically my OC is not going to just love on them and cater to them. But then the other OC runs away or cries or makes a whole dramatic scene out of no where???\n\nIt would make sense if that character was purposely described as someone who has sporadic moods and is very unstable but no. Basically all their characters are like that.\n\nDoes this make sense? Has anyone else dealt with this before...",

            "selftext": "Apologies for venting, but this is fresh and honestly I'm just on the verge of tears. \n\nI've had one very special and dear character for a very, very long time. I created her from the bottom up and put not just hours, but weeks into my research on her. I researched the storyline because I was creating her as an OC for a series, I researched mental illnesses and phobias, I researched refugee snatch and grab missions... literally anything for her, I researched and made sure to get things right. Now, I only use her with one person because we branched off from our old squad, and my partner hasn't written with me consistently in *years*. \n\nI get a few replies here and there. Sometimes once a month, sometimes once every few months, sometimes once a day depending on their mood. Most of what we write is no longer multi/novella, but para or less. I don't like it but life is life and if you're not in the mood to write, you're just not in the mood. I really care for the person behind the character that my own is with, we're very close and I don't mind waiting for them to be ready or in the mood. \n\nTonight I wanted to write, but I asked if I could send something and they just read it. I didn't ask for a reply at all, just that they read it. They said they would. I spent hours writing 16 paragraphs. I was SO excited for them to read it because I put SO much damn work into it only for them to get pissy with me and decide they weren't going to read it. I get so damn excited whenever I get even the smallest reply from them. I am always so happy because it's rare to get something from them now... but I don't ever get the same excitement from them. Would it have really been so difficult to just read what I had written like you promised me you would? Why did I put so much effort into something for them just for them to spit in my face and act like they weren't interested? \n\nI like feeling special, too. I want to feel wanted. I want to see you get excited for something I worked so hard on. I just want to get a little bit back from them and I rarely ever get it. I realize I shouldn't be upset, but it's so disheartening to work for something just to have it treated like nothing. I'm sorry if this seems bitchy or whiny or whatever, I'm just so frustrated and so hurt and I can't even talk to them about it because they literally do not care. They just blow me off when I have feelings like this. \n\nMake your partners feel special. It can be literally something as small as reading something they wrote for you, but it'll make all the difference in the world when it comes right down to it.",

I might be the bad RP'er here, but hear me out first! \n\nI have been roleplaying for about two years now, and it's somewhere around the beginning that I really tried getting better at writing like crazy. It's mostly done by learning from others, kind of? I have learnt how to write 'properly' by \"studying\" my RP partners' works, and then I would check my own samples, notice the flaws and learn how not to repeat them. \n\nAnyways. Basically, I feel like I'm starting to go a little overboard because I started to \"retake\" ideas from the posts I've written in my past RPs. Everything almost feels the same, and the I grow bored and sort of tired of it?\n\nI tell my partners about it and nothing changes even after they encouraged me and stuff. It's worth noting that I'm not a native english speaker, so I had to learn it the hard way. Especially that my vocabulary expanded very considerably ever since I started my very first RP.\n\nI can write paragraphs and usually go over novella style and, again, I'm mostly an ERP writer, and I'm not really that interested in SFW ones, if that's important. Most of my writing activities as of now is through RPs which now are becoming tedious.\n\nAny advice could help! I want to be a better writer for my partners! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I hope this is the right place to be posting and asking about this. Super sorry about the text wall!\n\nI'm in a predicament where I'm unable to roleplay happily due to issues in the rp. It's a DND roleplay with many, many characters. Despite that, I keep running into characters run by a specific person who I feel might be unnecessarily antagonizing against mine.  I'll explain at the end why I  believe I might be the one in the wrong here Sorry if this is all over the place I'm still a tad emotional.\n\nHere is the full story:\n\nI often roleplay meanspirited or immoral characters. They're complex and not always straight up evil. I understand that they're going to create enemies. However- with this one player, who I will call R1, I feel like all of my characters are hated by theirs. Even the ones of mine that aren't bad. I feel like this hatred goes a little too far at times with how R1 acts about it.\n\nIn the first rp, my character was in fact evil. But the problem was that she was mentally ill and that was what drove many of her bad decisions. R1's character despised mine. I was chill with it. But at some point some of it all started to rub me the wrong way. Anytime my character was brought up in a general chatroom R1 would hop on to express how much they wanted to kill my character, or how much their character hated them. If I roleplayed with another person, R1 would also talk about it in the general chat and express rage- especially if mine did something evil. This rage usually included caps lock and bold and italics. I never respond to them talking about mine. I don't respond to them asking to rp so that their character can \\*insert violent act here\\* either.\n\nThe second character I had that resulted in R1 acting in a way that upset me wasn't as cookie cutter evil. She was misguided and wanted the group of friends we were playing as to get along and stop fighting after they experienced something traumatic at the hands of their enemies. Foolishly, my character included a character who was abusive in this \"let's all be a happy family\" idea. R1's character was understandably upset. And then, in the general chat, R1 began talking about wanting my character dead yet again and their character beating mine up.\n\nThe third character I had was a brat. He made friends with the wrong person which turned out to be R1's character's mother. R1 was playing both the mother and the daughter. I had no idea that this character R1 was playing was abusing their daughter character, because it was only revealed /after/ the mother had died while trying to kill another character and mine had already mourned them. R1 did not do anything at this point in time, but I will come back to this character later.\n\nFourth and fifth characters were my ones that weren't mean or evil. The fourth was afraid of another character in the rp and believed that they were trying to kill them. This character happened to be the brother of R1's character. R1 jumped into general to talk about how ridiculous and stupid my character was being. They made jokes about how someone who wore dresses could possibly kill someone, and that if my character thought that then they must think R1's character would kill them as well. Fifth character did nothing to harm R1's character. They appeared in the same location. My character was a 6 year old and acted like it. R1's character, who is described as being happy and kind, suddenly changed personality (?), acted weirdly and called my character creepy. I think it was because R1 assumed my character was older? What made it really strange was that R1 used \"my character is a baby\" as their character's defense against anyone acting meanly to them in rp for grieving, when only a day earlier they thought mine was weird for acting like a kid. (which the \"if you look down on me ((the charracter)) for grieving you're a monster\" incident read as kind of passive aggressive and uncalled for? maybe?) Their character was an 18 year old and I just felt that it was odd they were okay with their character acting youthful but not mine.\n\nFinally, we return to my third character and what lead to me posting here today. My character didn't want to get involved in someone else's problem because they believed that they needed to worry more about food. R1's character stepped in to scream at mine and made it clear, like absolutely clear in their post that everyone could hear it. I guess so they could get everyone else to snap at mine? I had to step out at this point because I couldn't handle seeing this happen and then going into general chat and seeing them yet again talking about wanting to kill my character. I did not address R1's character in the rp. They stopped doing what they had been to yell at my character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is a case of me being too sensitive and needing to take a step back or if it's the other roleplayer that is the problem. They are currently in our general chat writing about how much my character is going to suffer if they decide to go to a party with their character and the rest of the group. As always, I am not responding to this. I might be jaded. They could just be having fun. I know I roleplay bad alignment characters who will likely end up making many enemies, but I feel like at this point that I can't roleplay one without getting attacked for it or having to deal with R1's characters creating smear campaigns against mine. The \"scream to get everyone in the rp's attention\" thing was not the first time it had happened. It had happened in the rp before and resulted in my characters being ostracized. My character was on track to getting a redemption arc and yet with this happening, and R1's character drawing attention to it, it feels kind of like there's no point to redeeming my character. I might have accepted this outcome in the past but I feel at this point that R1 might be the one taking things too seriously? Or its me??? I am not the only one whose characters they gleefully talk about negatively in general either.\n\nIf it helps, R1 almost always plays characters who are nice and friendly so that might be why we are often at odds what with me playing meaner ones.\n\nSo... What do you guys think? Am I problem here and do I need to work on my emotions involving rp, or is it them? I'm blocking them and discontinuing rping with them either way (per the admin's advice on situations like this) but I want to know if I should improve myself in the future. If I'm in the wrong here, I don't want to ruin anyone's experiences by getting upset about an rp in the future!",

            "selftext": "Initial thought: this is most likely my fault. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve currently put myself, because I eventually got angry and made the person in question get a bad night in.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSo I\u2019d been RP\u2019ing in a decently-sized open world community for three years, of which one was spend on the sideline due to a ban from the Old Owner of set community themself in the past. My history with the place starts here:\n\n\nThe Old Owner had a very big and compact document regarding background lore for the Community that only the Staff could access. Although it was massive, it surprisingly didn\u2019t really matter if you just wanted to RP with others, goof around, maybe beat up a random baddie, or try to exorcise someone who\u2019s been infected by evil plants because it was the first arc from your own background lore you ever made and suddenly everyone wanted in on it. Because of having created the mother of all goof arcs by making gardening scary (and I can sorta draw kinda), I later got promoted to Staff. A friend of mine had gotten inspired by and wanted to make their own goof arc to pass the time with friends around the Community. I gave their pitch a read, found it pretty cool and seemed to not break much, then said that they should approach the Old Owner like I did with my arc and pitch it to them whilst I vouched as well.\n\n\n... it got denied because \u201cit didn\u2019t function within the background lore\u201d, and when they asked what to change or alter to have it happen, the Old Owner said that \u201cgiving a User a background lore advantage would make them OP and that they\u2019d also tell others 100%\u201d. So the friend\u2019s arc just died that day because it couldn\u2019t get any feedback because of the history books being inaccessible to Users.\n\n\nNow the Old Owner was really protective about the big background lore. You could get banned over sharing even a line of it. Not that it like... had any major importance in the present and could easily fit that friend\u2019s arc in without it getting spoiled, but it\u2019s not like my friend was Staff.\n\n\nSo I shared the background lore document with the friend who flipped out about it being so more helpful for fixing the arc than shooting on the dark a billion times and the concern that I did a bad that was ban-worthy (plus the fact that I pulled a bad April Fools prank and got some slack for that).\n\n\nBut my friendo got to finalize their goof arc, had it approved and got some major joy outta it though! Even made a \u201cWhat If?\u201d concept thing for one of my OCs due to having anticipated that I wouldn\u2019t be banned. It was kinda heartwarming.\n\n\nThen I got reasonably banned when a forgiven tattletale told the Old Owner about it. Got unbanned when the Old Owner left on good terms, saying that I wasn\u2019t a bad person nor writer and that my actions were understandable. I told them that they were a pretty neat first Leader that helped me flesh out one of my most terrifying OC Monsters, and that they wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nWas very much my problem then, but not the one I wanna rant about today.\n\n\nYou might wonder why I made this little history detour. It\u2019s mainly the thing that initially shot my friend\u2019s goof arc in the foot:\n\n\n*Background lore*.\n\n\nI despise hearing those two words nowadays. I really do. It\u2019s been the bane of my existence for the past two years now and it\u2019s yet again fresh on my mind.\n\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for a place to have a history, a culture, a secret, such and such. It makes the worlds that you debut your characters in just a little bit more lived in, and makes for a cool fleshed-out environment. Sometimes it makes for really great RP moments if snippits could be used.\n\n\nBut, it won\u2019t always be the big thing for smaller goof arcs and RPs to focus on. If people wanna do some slice of life, or travel around for a User-made goof arc, or even just have OCs exist within the pre-established guidelines... *then unless if a User is actively out to ruin the background lore, you just let Users do whatever the heck they want.*\n\n\nIt\u2019s in the background for a reason.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSo after the Old Owner stepped down, a bunch of new folk wanted to snatch the title for themselves and either fuse the community with bigger ones as a side gig, burn the whole place to the ground, began kicking out Users for no real reason, became a dictatorship for a month, until the New Owner\u2014the peep in question\u2014finally got the title and lowkey went with the \u201cwe\u2019ll burn it to the ground but the ruins\u2019ll stay\u201d option.\n\n\nNow I did consider them a friend for a while. I\u2019d RPed with him when I first arrived, always lost in PvP fights due to ultra-lit fight descriptions detailing a billion dodges and attacks performed by his OCs with blood ties to *literal Egyptian gods*, was in a gang lead by a moron who still exists, and now he\u2019s making his own background lore document that\u2019s a big secret to everyone.\n\n\nThe old chats the community RP\u2019ed in all suffered from a big attack, a Portal that brought in OCs from any time, space, planet or universe broke down, and new \u201coutside area\u201d chats were tremendously hyped up with a big overworld and everything.\n\n\nGreat! Awesome! Just what my OC cast needs, some good \u2018ol globe trotting and adventuring!\n\n\nNow, all my OCs are detailed fan creations of a well-known British Sci-Fi/Fa TV Show called *Doctor Who* (of which I\u2019m writing my own fan series of atm). Basically, it\u2019s about a humanoid alien called the Doctor who has a blue police box time machine that can go anywhere it wants to go. The Doctor usually takes a small cast of supporting characters with him, mostly just your modern-day London commoner, and then takes them around the universe to adventure.\n\n\nWhich in it\u2019s Classic days was usually just getting stranded in a random quarry or forest unfamiliar to them, having to survive getting killed by bug-eyed monsters with the power of running away from it, and often setting up camp in the roughest of places. The format I chose to explain why my OCs can\u2019t just teleport around, why they\u2019re still on one planet, and why that time machine isn\u2019t a deus-ex-machina.\n\n\nUnlike many other User OCs (that actually do/did exist), they couldn\u2019t fly at will, turn everything in the surrounding area to gold, blow up entire buildings, turn into demigods, shoot car-sized solar beams out of their hands, effortlessly resurrect the dead (well except for one villain but that\u2019d always result in braindead zombies), turn into a ghost that can\u2019t be damaged, own a school-sized mech made out of a near-invulnerable metal that can fire a lazerbeam to obliterate three chats at once, had the ability to permanently take away someone\u2019s abilities or whatever... my OCs were all boring humans that got hurt when they stubbed their toe, of which one is just a tad smarter and occasionally likes to make baseball bats for teens that explode in the enemy\u2019s face. Their wiki\u2019s, tools, abilities and more were approved multiple times without an issue. Mostly because everyone\u2019s just your average boring human that might have some alien magic or knowledge but can still die to a knife to the gut.\n\n\nBut when put together, they were pret-ty good adventurers. Some could forage or hunt for food in the wild, others knew how to cook and set up camp. Some knew how to properly navigate unknown territory, others could mend sick or wounded people. And with the help some futuristic (yet extremely prone-to-fail) Sci-Fi/Fa gadgets from homebrew explosives, wristmounted grappling hooks, radioactive dust with elemental/magical properties turned into slingshot or grenade launcher ammo, or a canister that can store a bath\u2019s worth of water but turns it into scorching-hot decaf coffee when done so... suffice to say that it could get real fun depending on the situation.\n\n\nI was ecstatic to hear that I could finally put their adventure skills to the test!\n\n\n... then I get told that I\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t leave the old chats \u201cbecause the free roam adventure survival stuff should be hard for anyone and I\u2019m just too OP for that, have game-breaking tools, characters with too much knowledge and they all interfere with the background lore too much\u201d all of a sudden.\n\n\nHow fun... for everyone else.\n\n\nI was really disgruntled about it at first. Stuck on chats with nobody to RP with. I\u2019d already promised that I wouldn\u2019t use the *Doctor Who* time machine to mindlessly teleport around as it had lost a ton of it\u2019s fuel when it first arrived in the community\u2019s world. I\u2019d promised that I\u2019d make my gadgets fail if need be, break them, or leave them at home. Injure any OCs deemed too powerful for their own good as to not make the survival adventure aspect \u201cseem too easy compared to the others\u201d. Heck, I couldn\u2019t even have them bring their pre-established inventories because some of the OCs\u2019 bags had a slight \u201cbigger on the inside\u201d gimmick to allow for a few bigger-sized items like weapons or tools to be stored without overpacking yourself but still not having infinite space and the weight still being a massive problem.\n\n\nIt felt really unfair. Like breaking an MMA fighter\u2019s arms so an untrained kid with a knife has a \u201cfair\u201d chance at winning, or chopping off the legs from a sprinter so someone with astma can get a \u201cfair\u201d shot in a race. Every other OC could bring an Eldritch God to a barfight, but I couldn\u2019t bring my average survival team to a forest?\n\n\nEven after I nerfed them all to heck and back to the point that they seemed more like clueless nobodies that can\u2019t even stick to a path, I still wasn\u2019t allowed to venture out for the same \u201ctoo OP, tools and stuff\u201d reasons despite those not applying anymore.\n\n\nEventually, I finished writing a more \u201cacceptable\u201d OC\u2014a stereotypical ninja limited to more 16th century equipment that tends to travel alone but met the *Doctor Who* crew once\u2014that might be able to pass the New Owner\u2019s \u201ctoo OP\u201d reasons. Problem is, I couldn\u2019t enter them because the chat with the Portal\u2014the only way to bring in new OCs\u2014was canonically kaput.\n\n\nSince my *Doctor Who* crew had nothing to do, I send my homebrew Doctor to inspect the broken Portal that hadn\u2019t been touched since everyone left the old chats and wished to maybe fix it. Like what many other characters **without any knowledge regarding time and space travel** had done not even just a month ago.\n\n\nThe New Owner plops down some usually-friendly and helpful AI OC of their own, who begins to threaten and insult my Doctor for trying to just inspect it. Apparently it had tried to plug it into an experimental energy source with \u201csinister origins\u201d which didn\u2019t do anything.\n\n\nI thought that the AI\u2019s hostile behaviour was just a part of the RP, and that the AI had maybe gone rogue or something. Or maybe malfunctioned. Idk. I had my Doctor shrug off it\u2019s insults and asked to inspect the Portal yet again with his signature tool to see what\u2019s exactly going wrong, to which it just *evaporated* in his hands without my input due to a cryptic \u201cworld trigger\u201d.\n\n\nThe AI whined yet again, now insulting my Doctor regarding his \u201coverblown ego and sense of self-importance\u201d for just trying to help fix the portal, and after trying a few more times, just quit asking questions about it.\n\n\nThen the AI suddenly goes on about my Doctor being \u201ca threat to the whole world with unauthorized knowledge that might need to be limited\u201d, and went on about his nearby parked time machine that can\u2019t do anything being \u201cdangerous and interfering with it\u2019s work of putting up the Portal\u201d. Despite it not doing anything, because it can\u2019t, for a Portal that technically I approached first to try and fix.\n\n\nMore cryptic in-character insults later regarding being a danger and threat, and I PM\u2019ed the New Owner if the AI is actually evil or if it\u2019s some other thing that I can\u2019t do for some reason.\n\n\nCryptically, it was the latter. For some reason, my Doctor didn\u2019t have the knowledge on spacetime portals but the man-made AI with which nothing is wrong did. Nobody was supposed to be able to understand it, because of the dreaded background lore that nobody knows but the Staff. And the \u201cworld trigger\u201d notice was supposedly a way to say that \u201can OC can\u2019t do that yet because they can\u2019t understand it, even if it\u2019s in the realm of possibilities\u201d. Which I\u2019d never seen before, and isn\u2019t a single blog or post about. Hence why this just looked like an RP moment whilst in reality, it was just the New Owner trying to insult me away with his bratty AI \u201cbecause it would interfere with the background lore\u201d.\n\n\nWhat else, but the reason for this \u201cworld trigger\u201d even existing was because he wanted to reserve it functioning again for his own OC\u2019s entrance. Pretty selfish I\u2019d say.\n\n\nI tell him that it\u2019s really beginning to suck that I can\u2019t really RP anything. Everyone\u2019s off exploring foreign countries, becoming important contacts to tribes, villages and cities, blowing up giant monsters whilst I\u2019m limited to dead chats due to not having a single OC that\u2019s allowed out. I again get the whole \u201ctoo OP\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t jam with the background lore\u201d spiel, which I try debunking again and again with all the changes and promises that I\u2019ve made. Despite that, still can\u2019t leave due to the same exact reasons and I\u2019m getting really heated.\n\n\nI emphasize again and again that whatever massive world-changing arc he might be planning, I just wanna at least to slice of life stuff with other Users. Make my own unimportant goof arc, like maybe a murder mystery or a covert alien invasion in a faraway town. Can\u2019t do that \u201cbackground lore\u201d, and I\u2019d still be \u201ctoo OP\u201d and would ruin everything for anyone else.\n\n\nI try make the broken-armed MMA fighter comparison, since every other OC got mad combat power here and yet that doesn\u2019t have to be scaled down compared to a few adventurers. He says I\u2019m telling some sort of fallacy and that I should be grateful because nobody else has this problem. That I\u2019m ruining all their fun despite not even being close to the fun. Even insults me about being paranoid or overreacting.\n\n\nAt that point I\u2019m just fuming, occasionally texting in upper case, asking that he stops deflecting, take my questions and complaints seriously, and that it really hurts at this point. \n\n\nHe says that \u201cthere are no more questions\u201d.\n\n\n... well what the heck am I here for then?!\n\n\nMy last question, punctuated, lower case and anything, went among the lines of \u201cSo my OCs are allowed to leave the old premises, travel the new world, and have me do whatever I want if this isn\u2019t a problem?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure. You know what happens next if it goes wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA ban..?\u201d\n\n\nThe New Owner said that that would be the case, but that I\u2019d already made my choice to be banned (despite having not).\n\n\nHe briefly went on about me being toxic, ruining the fun for other, ruining his background lore and events that I couldn\u2019t even be a part of... and banned me.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSo now, here I am. Questioning if I was indeed being a bad User and worth the ban.\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m sorta convinced that I am despite not even having been able to ruin stuff in RP. Just a more OOC problem due to my bad temper and wasting a man\u2019s sleep.\n\n\nBut a fresh perspective might help me drive that thought home.\n\n\nAm I the @sshole?",

This starts with me asking others to rp with, someone responds, we agree on a place to have our characters meet, me doing the starter- having my character\u2019s presence known and looking for an object in the forest, searching for something. \n\nBut what does the other person do? It's either watching behind a tree, bush, rock and \u201cobserving my character\u201d. Like why the fuck people keep doing this? I didn't agree to play hide and seek. What? You wanted me to just magically try to find you and say \u201cOh hello person I discovered hiding in a bush, what is your wisdom?\u201d NO! STOP HIDING IN A BUSH AND COME OUT. Not only this is creepy but you're avoiding interacting with my character. \n\nThe best part is when they make their other character SLEEP. Unless they previously know each other and they need to go somewhere...No, I'm not going to wake up your character- *I'm going to have my character leave the \u201cinteraction\u201d. Who wakes up a random person on a tree??* In all my years of rping, whenever I see interactions between people I like to keep it somewhat realistic. There are times irl that\u2019s perfect to talk to someone\n\nI.e: Alone but drawing something, a person can approach that person and say, \u201cwow I really like your drawings, could I see more?\u201d This allows for more dialogue.\n\nSomeone who deliberately does not want to be approached: Eating with headphones in the ear. \n\nYou can\u2019t approach this person to chat with them, they don\u2019t want that. But for some fucking reason people always do their starters like this one! I would be kinda irked if someone stopped me from eating and doing stuff to get my attention to take off my earphones so that they can talk about the start of the universe! So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t do it to other people because that defeats the whole purpose of our meeting. \n\nI'm not sure whether this problem exists because there's nothing to talk about or people are bad with social interactions IRL and that's reflected in rping?",

I wondered if there was somewhere to just let it out to help me feel better and thankfully I stumbled upon this subreddit.\n\nSo I was doing (what I thought) was a great rp. We had a well organized server on discord, good fun OOC chat. We had a decent plan where the rp was going so plenty of material to work with. We were pretty consistent replying so when I didn't get a response for 24 hours I sent a polite \"Hey is everything okay\" message. Course, I got a reply of \"Yeah, just busy.\" So I then asked if they were enjoying it and I was just checking in as I have had people disappear with no warning before. \"Yes I am really enjoying it! No disappearing going to happen!\" Was the response.\n\nBoom. Overnight, server is gone, off my friends list and can't re-add them (I think they changed their discord name as it says the one I had is incorrect).\n\nNot sure that made sense, to be honest, but I needed to get it off my chest.",

I've even made a few myself over the years. But I've been noticing a growing problem lately. People taking a canon character, tweaking a few things (appearance/faceclaim, switching out weapons, giving them a new name) and calling them an OC for a verse. They have roughly the same personality, a similar backstory, and in some cases, know the same people and have the same relationships as the canon character with other canon characters. \n\nLet's be clear: This is not an OC, that's borderline plagiarism at worst and pure laziness at best.\n\nHas anyone else come across \"OC's\" like this? Why don't these people just write as the canon characters they're ripping off? I can't wrap my head around this.",
