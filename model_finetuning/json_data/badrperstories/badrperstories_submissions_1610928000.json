            "selftext": "Alright.  For starters, this story did not happen to me, but to my best friend.  We were on a forum site based around an anime community that was 18+, but not allowed to have graphic sexual content, and a good number of players there were genuinely not interested in ERP, even in the cases of some of those were interested in shipping characters into cute couples.  I was staff on the site.  Due to the number of sites for the fandom it was around, I do not want to specify more details on what show it was, so I apologize if this gets a bit hard to follow.  There's a TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo my friend was roleplaying a 7' tall, extremely muscled woman.  She's a character that's been around long before this site, but on this site she became a bit of a legend because people had such fun with her character idea, even if several people didn't see past \"haha she can punch hard\" into what made her an actually interesting character.  My friend was genuinely not interested in most attempts to ship a character with her because she's just not a particularly surface level character, and just being treated like one never goes well with her.  Also, a lot of the time, people treated the character as if she identified as an extremely masculine man who happened to have boobs just because she's physically imposing and has a temper; my friend's character doesn't fully like that, even if she's not into anything particularly girly; this also leads to some people just sexualizing the character way more than was ever intended (I drew the character art for my friend and had definitely not attempted to make it sexualized). At least for the most part, however, my friend is able to make it clear that the character is simply not interested in the ships suggested for her.  We'll call this character Red, just to have a (made up) name for sake of ease.\n\nNow for the other character and player involved.\n\nWe'll call this character Ivory, again, just to have a reference.  Ivory is a character who was allowed on the site by previous staff at one point, but who, upon re-reviewing (the player came back after a long disappearance), I could not actually bring myself to accept without adjustments.  The character is such a patently offensive stereotype of a lesbian (and one who specifically hates men enough to physically assault them on sight despite having no established character reason why) that it was both a heavily flanderized character and also did not meet the then current standard of quality expected on site.  I'd seen worse quality, and might have other stories there sometime, but this one was probably the most offensive stereotype I saw at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, I did not allow the character through until she was fleshed out enough to *barely* scrape through the review standards, regardless of me still not liking the character.  Characters were rarely denied outright on that site, and there was pressure to accept previously accepted characters.  This was one of the first instances to break that mold by requiring changes on a previously accepted app otherwise. It took him a couple of weeks or so to get the character through.\n\nAlmost immediately after accepting the character, I came to regret not just arguing to deny it outright.  As Ivory's player starts trying to plot with others, his colors start to show even more. He asserts that he's interested in more than just shipping/ERP plots, but proceeds to only attempt to plot with attractive female characters.  He admits that he would like there to be some sort of attraction, yet only shows instances of trying to create immediate, forced attraction or uncomfortably parasitic pairings.  After being turned away a few times, he locks onto Red and decides to try and get my friend to plot an rp with him.  I was already a bit aggravated at him for making people uncomfortable, but upon him seeing Red, things got... \"interesting\".\n\nThe community we were on was based off of a show, and in said show there was an abusive relationship between a girl and her ex, with her ex being clearly portrayed as manipulative and controlling and is often given a rape-tastic vibe.  Well, when trying to plot something with Red, Ivory's player is dropping clear hints of wanting something to be going on between the two, but my friend is firmly (if too gently) rebutting these suggestions.  Not one to be deterred, Ivory's player suddenly goes, \"Hey, I know what we could plot.  I can be the \\[abusive ex\\] to your \\[abused girl\\]!  Red and Ivory could be dating.\"\n\nAt this point I was just shocked that someone could suggest that with such a chill air about it all.  Especially when he continued as if the idea would be automatically accepted and was brilliant.  The abusive ex character was widely hated in the fandom, with most people who liked him merely liking his potential as a villain.  Red is also a character who very clearly, from her clearly public character app, is not one to be pushed around and just take it, to the point that it caused a lot of friction with her and her closest friends.  Not only had this guy not even tried to get to know what kind of character Red was, but he was also acting like it was a given that Red and Ivory had to date.  My friend was too nice and just kept saying why Red wouldn't be interested rather than an outright no, so I finally stepped in and said no (after confirming that my friend was uncomfortable too).  I directly warned the player not to try and shove ships or ERP on people who were not telling him yes.\n\nThe warning calms things down for a bit and my too-nice friend manages to talk out a completely clean plotline between the two.  Things seem alright and all for a few posts into the roleplay, and then Ivory's player manages to setup things where Red's player is dirty and needs to take a shower (more red flags lol) and, of course, tries to have Ivory walk in on the shower and wash off Red's back, with the whole post involving predatory and very sensual thoughts in Ivory's mind.  Red responds with a firm cease and desist basically, and then Ivory's roleplayer ghosts my friend (thankfully) and proceeds to repeat the same shit with other people until I get permission from the head admin to remove the dude from the site a few warnings later.\n\nIt was quite disgusting and frustrating.  In the past I was on worse sites where things were significantly more graphic (and even had a person get mad at me and my character for refusing to accept sex as an unneeded payment for healing their character), but the multi-week dedication to trying to get a predatory lesbian ship for the sake of getting his rocks off, despite constantly being turned down for coming across a bit rapey and forced, was upsetting.  It was all the more upsetting since it was in a place where he'd been actively warned about it by staff and even told he was making people uncomfortable.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen plenty of people try for such things and all, but what does one have to think they'll get by basically brute forcing someone into ERP even after being warned not to and turned down?\n\n**TL;DR:** Dude goes to a non-sexually-graphic site, makes a man-hating and one-dimensional lesbian to get his rocks off with, suggests a good plot would be having his lesbian be the abusive girlfriend of a character with a player who was clearly not interested, got warned and agreed to a non-ERP plot, and then proceeded to force the RP into a shower scene so that his character could have her hands all over someone else's naked body anyway.  Dude gets banned after being unresponsive to correction, and the migraine he gave me finally goes away with him.",

            "selftext": "\\*\"Excuse me?\"\\*\n\n\\*\"No like, that's what my character would say LOL\".\\*\n\nBefore I go any further, this is NOT a political post. \n\nSo I was contacted by someone for a roleplay. I wanted to do a Lord of the Rings themed RP, but as original as possible, with only a few characters making a short cameo appearance. This individual, lets call him DudeBro, was initially very interested and was all for an original plotline. He expressed interest in making a more female centric plot as well, and said he was upset women didn't play a bigger role in the movies or the books. I told him most of my characters are female so if he wanted, we could make it a more female-oriented party rather than the stereotypical adventurer dudes. He said he was all for it, and then suggested \"What if it's a different region of Middle Earth? It could be matriarchal and stuff?\" I thought it was genius and we set about detailing this society and how things work there, etc etc. \n\nAs this is meant to be an adventure story and since I'd already stated (and had it acknowledged) that I didn't want any smut in this RP, we didn't see the point in discussing that aspect of the society at all. \n\nStory begins. I've established my character as a small game hunter in this society. She hunts, she feeds herself and her little sister in their little hut, etc etc. It's all very heartwarming and soft and gentle and Hobbit-y. \n\nDudeBro replies. His character, as we'd discussed, was a low tier mage. Not to the level of Gandalf obviously; he couldn't fight a Balrog but he could light a candle with some effort. He was very proper and well mannered, he liked to decorate his room in the castle with comfortable things like blankets and pillows, etc etc. The vibe that I got from the way this character was described was a human version of Bilbo with magic. I distinctly remember the statement though: \\*He has a slightly acerbic tongue but he's usually very subtle and most people don't catch his insults. He's just really well mannered is all.\\* \n\nSo you can imagine my absolute surprise when the intro is DudeBro's character going at it with the queen. I mean this man may as well have been looking for oil with the degree of drilling he was doing, holy Christ. His character then proceeds to slap the queen across her face, and while she's on the ground, he calls for her two handmaidens, both of whom fall to their knees for him immediately and cue sex scene two. He then leaves and is basically waltzing around this castle like he owns it, literally just grabbing and using women here and there and they all either seem to not mind at all and continue about their business, or stop whatever they're doing because it's too overwhelming. \n\nI pointed out all these inconsistencies, the main two being that I'd expressly stated I wasn't looking for smut, and my confusion over how his character, in his low position in the castle, was able to have relations with basically EVERY female in the castle with impunity when it's a matriarchal society. \n\nCue the title of this post: I'm totally for women's rights! I just want full access whenever I want because I'm a man.\n\nDudeBro does his best to amend what he's just said and offers to write another post. I'd drafted up an email already stating that I was uncomfortable, that I no longer wanted to roleplay or be contacted by this person again, and that I wished them luck. I took my time because I wanted to be as courteous as I could without going off on this guy. Well, DudeBro took my silence as permission to post, in which he does a timeskip to him now in the forest looking for supplies for potions and such. He comes across my character and \\*straight up Godmod's a romantic sex scene between them\\*, then has the audacity to turn it around and godmod my character by having her constantly demanding/begging for more sex and his character saying shit like \"you're more than this\". \"I don't want you to be a sex object for me\", \"You're a woman, you're not a sex symbol\", \"No please, I want to know you, not just your body.\" (I had to go back and find the thread so I could copy-paste some of those line for y'all). \n\nOh my goodness, I was so enraged I just stopped replying altogether. I stopped using that email entirely, because--as I rightly assumed--DudeBro made several other emails and reached out to me, all with the same premise of wanting to do a female-themed LOTR RP. It was well over two months before I finally stopped receiving replies.",

            "selftext": "So, I started looking for an RP partner after a month chock full of exams. I hit it up pretty well with this user on a roleplaying app. Let\u2019s call that user B for simplicity\u2019s sake. We decided to do their plot. It\u2019s a pretty simple slice-of-life bubbly gal paired together with the quiet girl in class type of thing\u2013 very cute, a nice break from anything intense.\n\nI don\u2019t really have any high expectations but they do and B lays \u2018em out for me. Which is good! I like that. Though the only thing discussed was the length of the reply for each of us, a pretty hard emphasis on wanting a literate partner, and nothing else. Me, being the eager dumbo I am is pretty ready to get things started because I don\u2019t wanna plot anything out too much and so far we had a pretty good premise to build upon.\n\nI ask B if they wanted me to start but then reply that they\u2019ll start before shortly sending me a starter. I\u2019m pretty surprised and pleasantly pleased because I\u2019m usually the one who had to start things off and woooow that did not take long despite it being multi-para. But then again, what do I know? Sometimes people can type really fast and in all honesty it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much effort- misspellings, some grammar mistakes here and there and it was a pretty standard \u2018woke up and walked to school\u2019. The only odd thing was that,,, the setting is a mish mash of Japanese and American. Like, our characters and everyone else was American\u2013 American names and customs, vocab / slangs but the school was... designed as Japanese. From the uniform being a sailor fuku to how they reach the school and whatnot.\n\nOkay. That\u2019s cool. So, B\u2019s a bit of a weeb. They did say the RP plot was inspired from an anime. It\u2019s fine.\n\nLike I said, didn\u2019t really have that much high expectations on that app. But at that point I was a bit let down since B kept asking for literate partners and it seemed to B literate meant long paragraphs only.\n\nThe thing that brought my attention was near the end where they mentioned an NPC that they just kind of haphazardly threw in. Considering the setting and what kind of NPC she threw out\u2013 a quiet girl, my oc\u2019s archetype / role\u2013 I asked B if that was my OC they introduced and they said yes.\n\nNormally, I wouldn\u2019t have minded but they introduced my OC by mentioning a brother that doesn\u2019t exist. I never mentioned having a brother in her character sheet and then B basically controlled my character\u2019s actions\u2013 they might as well have written out my starter too. \n\nBut I went on with it because I was thinking what if it was like a starter thing to make it easier for their partner? Nope. After my starter was sent, B completely ignored whatever I wrote and proceeded to continue on writing and controlled my character for their other half of their reply. They completely disregard my character\u2019s personality and wrote out an archetypical quiet and anti-social one just following whatever their character wanted to do. Which contradicts with my character\u2019s personality and what they would do in the situation\u2013 sure, my character was the \u2018quiet\u2019 one but that didn\u2019t mean not speaking at all and willing to do whatever their character wanted.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m asking myself why am I even here if B is going to write my reply too lol. So, I asked B to stop controlling my character and they replied back with okay and a sorry. Okay, that\u2019s fine and dandy, we can then proceed and have some fun.\n\nB sends out another blog post while we\u2019re the middle of the roleplay that basically sums up as them ranting how roleplayers are so picky when it comes to roleplaying with them and mentions how lucky their roleplay partner should be to have B as a partner instead of having some horndog only looking for sex.\n\nUm. Alright. At this point I\u2019m kind of peeved because I feel like this was an obvious vague post about me. Now, I don\u2019t know if B had any other partners at that time but they posted that after I told them to not control my character. As the RP went on, I wasn\u2019t even enjoying it and I realised that I would\u2019ve ended it anyway because it was going nowhere considering how B basically ignores whatever I write and how unenthusiastic / curt B has become in ooc chat.\n\nI basically asked B if they were more comfortable with RPing the way they did before I told them to stop (i.e., controlling my character as their own and disregarding her entire personality, ignoring my post and basically writing out the entire rp by themselves). If they were then I told B I was fine with stopping the RP right now and that they should probably find another roleplayer who would mesh with their style of RP better. I did this because one: I\u2019m not enjoying it and two: B had another recent blog post up saying that their replies will be slower due to the fact that they had a loooot of people wanting to RP with them.\n\nB replies with: \u201c/k\u201d\n\nI reply back saying \u201cGreat! Hope you have a good day and find a rp partner that meshes well with your style.\u201d and left.\n\nNot even five minutes after that, B posts another blog post saying they\u2019re going to stop being \u201cnice\u201d to roleplayers who an attitude about one thing they do in RP and that these roleplayers should go fuck themselves.\n\nGee, thanks. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m super sensitive for being upset about this. But the vague posting\u2013 especially when they /know/ people can see recent blog posts so easily and they posted it when we were RPing can\u2019t help but make me mad :/. Really wanted to respond to one of those blogs asking them if they were talking about and confront them about it but I felt like that\u2019d be super childish.\n\nSorry for making this was way too long than it needed to be. If the formatting is fucked, I do apologise in advance! I\u2019m on mobile and this was honestly my first time posting lol.",

We gelled really well personally and chat a lot in ooc, they were open to collaboration, they're great and we get along famously, for the most part I enjoy our RP but their character drives me up the wall.\n\nFirst the plot they pitched was centered entirely around this damsel in distress who btw is actually totally badass in battle but she's a \"shy soft girl uwu\" very much a savior op heroine type. Which...okay, whatever, we all either had or dealt with characters kinda like that at some point but my OC was pretty much thrown to the wayside/after thought as their OC, backstory and plot was \"tHe FoCuS\" and pretty much along the lines of\"and yeah, nanis OC is there too.\" In regards to my character's inclusion.\n\nAgain, like I get we've all had a Mary Sue or Gary Stu, sometimes you need to godmode a little to get some progression but this character is ridiculously \"perfect\", can flawlessly wield other characters weapons as their own no matter what, yet expects to be treated like soft girl princess, the whole world is out to get them, every one wants to romance them, blah blah. I feel like they occasionally \"throw me a bone\" when they realize I'm getting annoyed (i.e. my character pointing out somewhere along the lines of \"if you could do that the whole time why are we even here?). \n\nI know people have had it worse but damn, give your characters some dimension, some flaws, some personality?

            "selftext": "Hello again, I'm writing this post the second time cus when I was nearly finished with it, my phone crashed on me and I lost *everything* \\- so now I'm on my laptop and I can finally make the text nice and ***pwetty***. Anyway. Obligatory \"English is not my first language\" and \"This is a *long one* bud\"; so let's start, shall we?\n\nSo, if any of you remember me from my stories or me vibing in the comments, I'm a public DRRPer of 3/4 years with Discord being my one and only platform as of now. I found my community and I get on with everyone there great, even if I'm closer to others more but that's natural, no? Regardless, I need to provide some context as to why I even got myself into this mess.\n\nBack in 2018/2019, I joined a server with few of my friends which solidified our current community and friend group. I've met one of my close friends who we will call **K** for the sake of anonymity. So, the two of us immediately click and we have a splendid time with our characters and others. His character was a Big Meme Bro type of character while mine was a Sunshine child that didn't know anything better and was just a cinnamon roll, so the two of them grew very close. Everything was ruined though when it was revealed he was the Mastermind, breaking her and me mentally - but it was a great twist, one of the best MMs I've seen in my career so again, gj if you are reading this **K** \\- but we decided that we will re-apply them someday so they can just be siblings without any of them being a mastermind or traitor or anything like that; just pure, platonic sibling relationship.\n\nSo, our story begins around two weeks ago? At least at the time of making this post. So. I hit a dry wall with RPs as I was only modding my own one and the ones I was in I was either dead in or they have finished - so I started becoming bored and more burnout due to not having a proper way of focusing on something that wasn't college, irl and modding. So, me and **K** are vibing in VC one night and he mentioned that he found a Summer Resort RP and that he's gonna app his character there - that we will call Kai - and I asked if he ould send me the link too. So I get the link, join the server and  o h  b o i\n\nThe amount of red flags that I've got hit with from the very start is not to be underestimated, ESPECIALLY since they just kept coming and they wouldn't stop coming.  \n\n\n**Red flag number 1, Big Trigger List**; now, I'm not an asshole, I know people have different lives and different things happened that would make their triggers be triggers, but there's a fine line between a genuine trigger and being ridiculous. In my eyes, if you are in a fandom and your trigger is gore when the fandom and game/book/film/etc is gory, it poses a problem, no? Or when your trigger is simply mentioning a character from that fandom. I am GENUIENLY concerned for anyone who upon seeing name 'Kaede' or 'Kokichi' have a full on panic attack, and I am not meaning to be an ass when I say that if it's something that happens to you you REALLY need to find help. But that's a vent for another time, point is, the trigger list is a long and ridicolous one seeing as this was a DRRP, which is about teens/young adults killing each other in horrible ways and being killed themselves in over the top executions.\n\n**Red flag number 2, No Lore Doc**; there was no doc or channel telling us about the universe - nothing, nic, nada. We didn't know if the world is in ruin, what year it was, if the events of canon DR were a thing here, what effects did the Season 1 had on the world - there was absolutely nothing to go off of. This will be important later on, so keep this in mind.\n\n**Red flag number 3, Google Form Apps**; so, for context, there are several ways I saw people app to DRRPs: via a discord message by filling up a template, using google docs or google forms. Now, all oft those have advantages in their own rights, except for Google Forms as let me tell you, they aren't good for apps AT ALL. The word limit is impossible to work with if you are someone that goes into a lot of detail, you need to do everything in one go which is impossible if you are busy, you can't save progress for later nor edit it and you can't access it unless you will be given the perms to see ALL of the forms, and that's not good for obvious reasons. There were several people - along with me - that complained about losing our apps cus of how the forms worked and few even HAD to ping the mod to ask about THEIR character info because they couldn't access their form app.\n\n**Red flag number 4, A shitton of bots**; not such a big issue, but it makes you wonder why the server needs a bot for everything and yet doesn't have a bot SPECIFICALLY made for DRRPs(Ultimate Assistant is dope and saves so much time, pass it on) especially when one of them just... Randomly reacts to your messages for no reason??? Idk, whenever I see too many bots I just grow sus of the place.\n\n**Red flag number 5, Overuse of TupperBox**; for those uninitiated, TupperBox is a bot made for roleplaying where you can make your messages have different characters. I don't mind it as much? I know my friends have mixed opinions on it but for me, as long as it's not exsessive and isn't all around the place I can live with it? What's the problem here though is, is that a lot of people useit for OOC chat and it's jsut really, *REALLY* hard to figure out who the fuck is talking when the only profile that pops up is that of TupperBox.\n\n**Red flag number 6, Apps for Protag/Support/Antag**; this just screams 'App to have a plot armour of some sort!' to me. Having apps for this just underwhelms the roles in my opinion, cus the characters are supposed to develop or fill those roles naturally, not becuase they apped for it. It's much more satisfying to look at the rp at the end and be like \"Wow, this character really was a great antagonist with their development and reasoning\". Also, even if they said that they will just \"give them things to do\", isn't that something the players should instigate? If they are interested in messing up a crime scene, they should go into the DMs and ask if that's possible - at least that's my opinion.\n\n**Red flag number 7, My Gut;** not a really worthy red flag, but I always trust my gut. Of course, there was one or two instances it was wrong, but usually, it is right when there's a sketchy RP on the horizon.  \n\n\nThere were other red flags, but those are all the ones I can remember from the top of my head. But regardless of those, I still decided to app because **K** said it will be fine and I trusted him with it. So, me, him and three of our other friends - that I will introduce later - decide to app together which creates the meme of our group being called \"*RP name* \\+ DLC\" due to the four of us apping charaters from the RP where we all met and our friend just tagging along with their own character. Everyone was getting fishy vibes, but we simply gave the rp BOD, and vibed there.\n\nSo, some time passes and I check the general and I see that the host says how they dislike docs, so I both jokingly and genuienly comment that I never seen anyone that disliked Docs so much - because I really never met anyone that felt so strongly about Docs - and the host snapped at me as if I did something wrong? Luckily, **K** was there to defend me and help escalate the situation down, because knowing me I'd just accidentally snap back at them.\n\nSo that was fun; since then, I felt as if I were walking on egg shells, which was both bad for my anxiety but also good overall cus I though that would make me less probable to be accepted, and at that point I just wanted an excuse to fuck right off.\n\nSo, the next few days are calm; I'm focusing on a FCFS RP that my friend set up - that is so much more fun than this one, which is ironic without context - as the cast reveal date rolls closer. Me, **K, M** and **S** are in VC together, with others that decided to join the server just to spectate it, and are just vibing together when we saw that someone commented something along the lines of \"Oh I'm not gonna get in because I didn't write a backstory\" and we just looked at it, then at 'eachother' and laughed. I am still dumbfounded as to how can someone forget to write a backstory, especially when the form is forcing you to put *something* in every category; remember this.\n\n So. Cast rolls around, a bunch of people I don't know and then **K's** character gets accepted so we woop for him, just for me to see a ping, meaning I also got accepted! Yay, such *achievement*. Regardless, I go back to the channel just to see something **very** off.\n\nSo, my character has a fake name - who calls their child Fiyu Chimo after all - and she hides it to protect her family from cops and all; I made sure to mention it both on the google doc I initially sent and google form, and yet the host put in her *real name*. Everyone was so confused cus her new name was a new addition I added to her rewritten and improved version. Adding that to \"Secrets that were revealed too soon by the hosts\" hole. Regardless, my friends told me to not argue about it because it's not worth it - and quite honestly, they were right, it's not like her name being fake was a big secret, it is rather obvious seeing the name she goes by - and I simply left a snarky comment in the character discussion channel where I wrote \"welp, guess thats one secret gone\". \n\nSo, everything else goes by; the other two people from our friend group get accepted, some other peeps I don't know about and then **that** guy. What guy? The \"I didn't write anything for the backstory\" guy. They got in somehow when our friend, **S**, didn't. As someone who rped with **S** before and saw his apps, I am CERTAIN that bias caused him to not get in - either that or his character cus he was an antagonist and not a really nice person, but a VERY good character. Anyway, we are laughing about it, congratulating **S** on escaping the shithole until we see a notification in the general. \n\nWhat was it, you migth be asking? It was the host pinging **S** to ask him about his character's name and talent. Apparently one of the accepted decided to immediately dip cus they didn't want to rp, and he got their spot? What's even weird - and became another red flag - was that they literally went into the public chat and asked him for the info that THEY should have; after all, they had his app and all. So, **S** provides the deets and he's in with the gang. I believe it is the time to introduce the main gang so here we go!\n\n\\-Fiyu, aka **me**, Ultimate Chimney Sweeper;  \n\\-Kai, aka **K**, Ultimate Memeticist;  \n\\-Min, aka **M**, Ultimate Informative Hacktivist;  \n\\-San, aka **S**, Ultimte Luck;  \n\\-Oda, aka **P**, Ultimate Shogun.\n\nEveryone in this gang got in and we are just screaming internally, but we decide to give this RP a shot and do our best - after all, perhaps it just had rough beginnings? Some RPs I was in had rough beginnings and were awesome at the end. So anyway, I make a relationship chart, some people fill it up, others don't etc etc we vibing and then the RP starts - yesterday, at the time of this post - and we are just sweating internally, ready for everything that could happen.\n\nSo, before the prologue happens, we notice that there's a new channel called 'lore', where the host *just started* to put in the lore. Was it our lore? Nope. It was Season 1 lore. So, few minutes before the RP starts, we *just* learn there was a killing game before??? And we are like: \"uhhh wouldn't everyone know about it then-\" but we are too tired by it to question it.\n\nStill no lore for our Season though, but be patient, I'm getting to it.\n\nSo, prologue starts - everyone leaves the boat and vibe on the deck. We are allowed to interact for a short while, so I **IMMEDIATELY** claim Kai seeing as **K** also wanted to interact with Fiyu - additional person also joined in, who's character we will call Yuu and the admin we will call **Y.** Apparently, **M** met them before, and tbh with the time I rped with them, they are such a good person. Probably one of the small number of people that I actually enjoy on that server. \n\nAt the same time, we suddenly check a ping in the character discussion, which was from the host themselves. They pinged us to say that **everyone is fucking dead**. I'm not kidding, they said that all of the characters' families were **KILLED** in front of them at a very young age, and that was the tipping scale for me. I didn't 'mind' the name being revealed because it wasn't that importnat, but this? OH BOY LEMME TELL YOU A STORY!\n\n So, Fiyu is a **very** family-orientated person; her entire concept is that she's dependant on her family due to her circumstance, and she spent all of her time with her foster family when her parents left her in their care due to having to travel abroad. If her entire family would be killed - as the host said - **she would already be dead**. She CAN NOT survive on her own due to her being overly sick, malnurished, ignorant of the world and the like. She doesn't even know how to read and write, how on hell would she survive??? \n\nAnd the host WOULD KNOW THAT **BECAUSE THEY HAVE HER APP!** If all the families were fucking murdered in front of the charaters, why would they accept someone that has a backstory that contradicts that to hell and back? I'm not even gonna go into details as to how such event will change EVERY character because this isn't the time for it. So, obviously, me and my friends were pissed and I decided to explode. I said *nicely*(and by that, I mean I was passive aggressive which was probably a bad move on my side but can you blame me?) that this would mean that Fiyu wouldn't be alive and that her backstory and character relies too much on her family, and the host just replied \"fine then i guess her family wasn't killed\". \n\nI'm proud of myself, I finally stood up for myself. But still, this is why you **REVEAL THE LORE BEFORE YOU EVEN START ACCEPTING APPS!** All of this could have been avoided if you simply told us what the setting and lore was of the universe, and not just walk in in the middle of a prologue being like \"haha your families are dead l o l\".\n\nRegardless of that...  The three of us go to the beach as we make it clear we are claiming it, and we start talking there. Except not even few SECONDS LATER, people start invading it; at the end, there were like 6 people there interacting at the same time, and it was getting chaotic. At this time, me and my friends are just shaking and screaming in another server because everything is just a chaotic mess. It wasn't even an entertaining mess of \"it's so bad it's good\", it was just **B A D**.\n\nSo, after like, 20 minutes, we are called back to the deck for some reason. So everyone goes there, me, **K** and **Y** arrive there late cus we had to wait for each other to respond but we manage to get there. So we just vibing as we stare at the fucking chaos that was happening. Apparently there was a helicopter that nuked the ship? Some kids jump off the plane announcing that they are sons of the last MM? They shoot someone and then they fuck off... So that happened. \n\nSo, after that happened, me, **K** and **Y** just moved away again to continue our interaction, and to be honest the few lines we managed to get in before all of us went to bed were so much better than the entire prologue.\n\nI just *can't* wait for the murders and motives, cus if the prolog was such a mess, those will be a disaster; I might make an update post about it as it will continue, if people would be interested lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; me and my friends apply to an RP with deveral big red flags and get the biggest dumpsterfire we ever experienced in our RPing careers.",

            "selftext": "So I've noticed a lot of posts (if not, all of them) looking for long-term partners, which of course makes complete sense if it is meant to be a drawn-out plot, but am I the only who gets put off by that requirement?\n\nIt might just be because I have commitment issues, but I really do see RPing sort of like dating when it comes to finding a writing partner. I tend to feel things out with them through OOC and their writing. I **never** expect them to stick around because there's a high chance we won't mesh, the rp may get dry, they die irl, ect. \n\nThe longest I've ever written with one person was like a year but I've heard stories of people sticking to a single RP/partner for over 4 fucking years...like bruh. That takes some serious dedication but if you're invested and having fun, kudos for you. I just cannot imagine anything going on for that long and plus, there can be some serious damage if things go sour, just like in a relationship. It's taxing and I bet there'd be some serious heartache. I feel like I'd totally get wrecked and maybe even quit RPing all together if I stuck to someone for that long for them to only leave (or god forbid ghost me). \n\nThen again, the definition of \"long-term\" could be relative right? Could be a week...a month? But still, it still gets me. All I ask of my partners is that when we both feel the RP should be wrapped up, then so be it. No need to drag it on unnecessarily. \n\nWhat are you guy's thoughts?",

            "selftext": "TL;DR at the bottom for those who don\u2019t want to read the saga. \n\nSo this person had put out an ad for a fandom themed rp. I\u2019d been craving that fandom for quite some time and hadn\u2019t found too many people to do it in that era since said fandom had recently released a movie series about another era. Point being, I was desperate for a role play in that specific era. My mistake. \n\nI used her as as a gauge for her writing, because to me, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that the ad you\u2019ve written has been written by you. Her ad was very well written and even had quite a few ideas in place. Upon contacting her, I found out that she\u2019d actually worked out quite a few sub plots to follow along the main one. It was very interesting.\n\nWe proceeded to establish characters, had a lot of back and forth about how well we had designed them and how well they\u2019d get along, etc etc. Y\u2019know, pre-game excitement. \n\nAbout four posts in (and our posts are several pages) she starts up OOC chit chat again, wanting to get to know me personally. That\u2019s fine. But if you saw my last post, you know: I\u2019m hella suspicious. I answers the questions I felt comfortable with and ignored the ones I didn\u2019t. Mostly the identifying ones: what\u2019s your actual name, where do you live (I don\u2019t mind giving out my state but she was asking for region in the state and at times, kept bringing it up and tried asking for street), what high school I went to (just to \u201csee if we\u2019re high school rivals lol\u201d \ud83d\ude44)\n\nIt was getting a bit much so I told her I\u2019d like to stop for the day. It was getting quite late anyway, and I had work in the morning. She flips a switch and starts accusing me of faking my gender and pretending to be someone. Super aggressive and angry. I fired back and said I couldn\u2019t care less what she thought, I was here for role play and if that\u2019s not what she was here for, I was happy to fuck off. She flips the switch again and goes back to her happy, casual self and continues the rp but keeps sending me snide comments here and there, then eventually (and \u201cplayfully\u201d) accused me of role-playing as a girl who wanted to roleplay. She proceeds to tell me that apparently penpals do this all the time. They adopt the persona of a character and write letters to each other as that character. She then said (insert title here). \n\nBadgered and harassed me for pictures, demanding I make a sign or write something on a sticky, demanding I take specific poses etc etc. I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with any of this and was deleting the rp thread on my end. She then pulls a 180 and goes \u201chey I\u2019m really sorry, it\u2019s just a bit exciting me for to do stuff like that.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe\u201d then admits that she is in fact a man and even sends a photo and everything (exactly the way he wanted me to take them). I told him I didn\u2019t care what his gender is from the start, I was literally just there for the writing. He starts a sob story about how most people don\u2019t rp with him because he\u2019s a man, how he\u2019s thinking of abandoning it altogether, how he \u201cfound solace\u201d in pretending to be a girl and how his response rate shot through the roof. He then takes screenshots of two Facebook accounts, one his own and one of another girl, and shows me the differences, citing that the fake account has only been up for a few months and already the inbox and notifications are overflowing, meanwhile his real account is relatively empty. \n\nI managed to coax him into giving me his real name, found him on Facebook, went through his friends list and found the poor girl he\u2019d been taking photos from. I sent her the whole conversation and apologized. She thanked me and said I wasn\u2019t to blame since I had no idea and that apparently, this has always been trying the \u201ccasually close\u201d scheme for ages with girls. \n\nI got an email a few days later from the guy yelling me and being all upset about how I betrayed his trust (literally started using dialogue lines from one of those subplots I mentioned earlier, in which an NPC betrayed his character), and that because of me, he\u2019s never going to roleplay ever again. \n\nTL;DR - guy pretending to be girl tried to coax personal information out of me during a roleplay as a \u201cgetting to know you\u201d thing, got upset and overreacted by admitting his real identity and showing the fake one he made to feel better about himself, then got mad and tried guilt tripping me when I told the real person he was catfishing using her photos.",

            "selftext": "I've been holding off from making this post because this guy was on the autistic spectrum and I felt bad for him. However, he was high-functioning. He was of-age, he drove and he was literate. My girlfriend is also on the spectrum in a similar manner, so I can understand. However...\n\nYou aren't exempt from criticism if you're high-functioning. You're a person just like anyone else. I want to treat you as a person like anyone else. And if you're a bad RPer... you're a bad RPer like anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met this dude a long while ago through this website and we hit it off. We came from a similar region and he was nice and goofy. His roleplaying honestly wasn't that bad and he had creativity. However, after some time both of us found that we weren't finding RP in one another that we wanted so we peacefully signed off on it and just talked OOC. I like to let people vent to me. However, before that, I found plenty of red flags which eventually culminated much later.\n\nExhibit A:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/MV2EXER.png](https://i.imgur.com/MV2EXER.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was a damn pain to plan things with. He wanted you to guide everything along. Not only that, but if you asked him if he was dry on ideas, he just sidestepped. Sidestepping infuriates me. Just say 'no'. It makes me feel like I'm talking to a bot.\n\nHe was a decent writer and could play canon characters well, but he had a tendency towards OC characters that were Gary Stues. He wanted me to play a well-known canon woman for a romantic relationship with his OC. I just told him straight up that it'd be boring for me and his character wouldn't suit her wants. I like to respect the canon character I play. To top it off, the canon characters he played hyped up his OC as someone awesome and miraculous. To be fair, they were the main character of the game in question, but the game in question was one with a strong morality system- and infamous for 'evil endings' where the main character is heavily customised. I would've liked just one or two dubious acts/character traits to spice it up, but no. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExhibit B (context explained a two paragraphs down)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/O8RKAQJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/O8RKAQJ.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no stranger to multiple messages. I've done it, loved ones have done it. Pop off 5 messages, sure, it doesn't bother me. This guy however could pop off 30. I wanted notifications on in our server of course, but as a result of that I had to hear my phone shitting out notifications left right and centre when he was online. I was too nice and easygoing with people so I had trouble initially telling him to cut it out. Furthermore, when you didn't immediately answer, he would directly ping you or message you your username- 'hey joe? JOE'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe context of this second screenshot was when I recommended he check out a roleplay ad for his favourite fandom that I'd seen make the rounds. This advertising guy was happy, literate, didn't really do NSFW stuff- a good fit, I thought. Said dude I'll call Blue. AnnoyingRPer messaged him once apparently and they hit it off. However, he said Blue was 'an asshole' and it didn't work. I needle him and Annoying eventually admits it's because their initial RP fell apart, Annoying started playing the victim and claiming Blue hated him and Blue tried to cheer him up and suggest some more plots. While Blue was typing, Annoying screamed in OOC for him to stop and it just went off the rails from there. He had a habit of telling me to stop typing after I'd try responding to a wall of DMs of his, too. I don't know why you can't write a succinct paragraph rather than 30 long-winded insane DMs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis dude was bananas, I soon learned. I comforted him and suggested some ways to get better partners. He said he was banned from multiple servers and no one liked him. He had in his mind that there was a literal gang of people lurking reddit who downvoted his ads (which were cute and inconspicuous ads, charming and fine by all standards. they also directly mentioned his high-functioning part of the spectrum) and banned him from servers he'd never been on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked him why would a group like that even exist. I'm sympathetic to this guy at this point because I've been paranoid and anxious too. He explains he's had some messy experiences on servers. I knew there was more to it though. As long as he would keep badgering me and trying to garner sympathy, I'd try to find out the truth. You earn my sympathy when you give me a good reason. I wanted to know why he got banned so I could help him NOT get banned in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eventually did and he basically harassed RPers on servers for smut and acted like a creep. I'm heavily paraphrasing, but he'd follow people to their DMs, badger them and end up bringing in admin intervention, resulting in a ban. Somewhere in the midst of this tale, he reportedly had a girlfriend who 'cheated' on him with another male RPer in front of him. He sent me pictures of their DMs and it was plainly a chatlog of a girl telling Annoying that they had never been together, that he made them uncomfortable and that this other RPer was her boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had it in mind that a conspiracy was out to get him when he joined a server and a player in the know immediately warned a moderator about him. It didn't result in an immediate ban, but from what I inferred, he earned one shortly thereafter. That's heavily paraphrased from my memory, but I believe the next screenshot explains it well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExhibit C:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/uZ4nEVU.png](https://i.imgur.com/uZ4nEVU.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically another one of his explanations as to why there's a conspiracy. He only harasses mildly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it, really. I'm not going to elaborate on his name or more of his intimate personality because I don't think an actual conspiracy/ban-ring would serve him well, but after hogging for sympathy so often, not taking advice, harassing people, not driving conversations/asking about me at all, you're a funny story to me.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just need to rant because I\u2019m honestly severely depressed about this. \n\nSo at the beginning of quarantine in the USA (about April for my state) I got into RPing. It is a nice hobby and a good way to pass the time. I met someone in May and we started to roleplay together. She kind of showed me some things when it came to being descriptive and I learned a lot from her. To this day, it\u2019s the best roleplay I\u2019ve ever had by a long shot (not that I haven\u2019t had any other good ones) I don\u2019t know how to express how amazing this was but I throughly enjoyed it and she said she did too. Eventually we became friends and even exchanged numbers. Months went by and our RP came a looooooooong way. We were even discussing what to do for our \u201canniversary\u201d in May. And then one day she up and disappeared. Now I know everyone gets ghosted and I\u2019ve been ghosted plenty of times but this was different. This was awful because of how much I cared for her as a friend and how our roleplay had gotten me through some really tough times. I\u2019m was worried that something had happened to her or that I had offended her in some way but I looked on our platform and she was still active to this day. It\u2019s been a few days, coming up on 5 since she ghosted me and I\u2019m honestly devastated. I know I shouldn\u2019t let my feelings rely on RPs and blah blah but I did, and I learned my lesson. I still don\u2019t know why she ghosted me or if I did something wrong but I\u2019m thinking of quiting RPing because of it. I know it\u2019s dramatic but our roleplay and her as a friend meant so much to me. And now it\u2019s gone.\n\nAnyways if you have read this far thank you for listening to my rant and I hope you have a great day!",

We need to muscle through a dungeon and I keep trying to reassure my DM that we can help control the chaos and help make sure we get through the Dungeon with plenty of roleplay, exploration, and everything.\n\nSo, I'm unfortunately working an extra hour today, but I'm training so it isn't too stressful. See a ping from the D&amp;D server. Heart SINKS. Last night made it seem like we might be able to play like we might be able to get something in because the DM had a lot of laughs with us. It seemed super like, I was reinvigorated with hope because my week had been so bad and I was like, \"please just not D&amp;D.\" \n\n***\"Sorry, woke up with fuckey throat, no dnd.\"*** \n\nWe still have FIVE HOURS until the session starts, and my heart just stops. I just get so frustrated because our DM cancels over every little thing and we can go weeks without playing at a time. My friend asks\n\n\"Are you sure it's just a temporary case?\"  \n***\"Hopefully, but voice dysphoria bb.***\"\n\nOur DM is Trans and Plural, so I can understand this. It's not fair for me to be mad, or frustrated. I can't be inconsiderate of others, but I still chime in anyways with a:\n\n\"are you sure you're gonna be out of it all day?\"  \n***\"honestly voice dysphoria would assassinate me for a week usually but since it's a minor cause I may be fine but it just started my day off near completely mentally drained, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get worse cause I don't want to be the protector of Gotham.\"***  \n\"I understand. I don't want you to force yourself to do anything then. Just focus on making sure you're alright mentally.\"  \n***\"yeye\"***\n\nand I know that it's not fair. It's NOT FAIR to be, mad over D&amp;D, but due to IRL home stuff- I don't feel safe in my home, I'm bitter about my work week. I just want to escape somewhere and no RPG or immersion FPS can get me as engaged as d&amp;d can. It really makes me feel like I can be someone else. That's just what I want right now, to be someone else. I can't beg my DM, because then they won't have fun and then NOBODY'LL have fun.\n\nI just wish me and my two friends apart of the 7ish person party could find another game to play in tonight because I just want to try and- getaway. If I had at LEAST a backup game to play in I wouldn't be bitching, but I quite literally have NOTHING else to do tonight that'll let me feel at all what I do when I get d&amp;d. No friends to hangout with, nowhere to go, I'm trapped in a house I don't feel safe in and I'm just frustrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this sounds batshit crazy.",

I gave it a try again and made a very well thought out profile for my characters and what I am looking for and put it as ERP Request on some furry RP Discord server request channels. After choosing a couple partners and making them sure that I was looking for long term detailed RPing, I got very frustrated and exhausted of writing my heart out all night long after they reassured me they would invest on the RP sessions only for them to reply with one liners or things that would seem outright comical. Only about two RP partners of mine were ever actually good from all the others I tried to have and I am now here thinking if I am doing something wrong or if the chances to find good partners are just that low.\n\n\nCan anyone help answer this doubt of mine from your own experience? I would also like to know if there are communities that have better RPers out there.",

Most of the time, roleplays will work out because I have lots of ideas and I like a lot of stuff, but unfortunately, sometimes I just have no chemistry with my writing partner (for example if they are very pushy, or don't like any of my ideas, which is fair but I doubt they would like the way I write then) and if this happens, I end the roleplay while it is still in the planning phase because I don't want to waste their and my time with a story I know I don't want to write. \n\nI always say 'Hey, I might be interested, we can see if we find something that we both like. If not, please tell me and I will do the same'. But still, people sometimes call me a faker, someone who wasted their time or even suspect that my only goal was to plan a roleplay with them just so that I can later leave? Why the hell would I do that?\n\nThis conversations are always so draining. I don't owe them anything, yet I feel like a bad roleplayer sometimes for something that is (in my opinion) the best thing I can do. Do some people really have no expectations at all when it comes to writing chemistry or know from the beginning that they want to write all fantasy stories?",

            "selftext": "This happened to me TWICE in the same RP group, ironically, by two different members. But it was back to back and enough to make me wanna scream.\n\nFor context, it was a Harry Potter RP server, not a lot of experienced RPers in it but it was something to pass the time. \n\nIncident 1. Miss Crucio Victim\n\nIn this instance, my character, a Ravenclaw girl, was just meeting another character in the owlery. It wasn\u2019t a planned rendezvous or anything, they were just running into each other and my girl character wanted some friends so it was supposed to be a simple meeting RP. Then another girl OOC asked if she could join us and I was okay with it. She talked a bit with the other person in the discussion channel but I wasn\u2019t paying attention because I went AFK to talk to someone else in my DMs (it was an unrelated discussion) and went back to the RP.\n\nShe runs in but claimed a First Year just hit her with the Cruciatus Curse because they didn\u2019t like her because her parents were Deatheaters or something. She was gonna send a letter to her mother about it.\n\nLet me reiterate.\n\nA FIRST YEAR. Had just hit her with a curse that causes EXCRUCIATING PAIN and instead of going to the Hospital Wing or something, she decided to go all the way up to the OWLERY to send a letter to her mom\n\nMy character, of course, asked questions because it didn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cWhy did you come all the way up these stairs after that?\u201d I needed to send a letter to my mom. \n\n\u201cHow would a first year know an Unforgivable Curse?\u201d I dunno what parents teach their kids these days. \n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you go to the Hospital Wing?\u201d I\u2019m afraid the kid will come back to kill me next time.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a Fifth Year? Can\u2019t you defend yourself?\u201d I only know dark curses. I didn\u2019t want to hurt the kid.\n\n\u201cHow did you get this far in the school year without knowing anything else?\u201d I know potions too.\n\nLIKE SERIOUSLY?? In the end, they did drag her to a professor to report the incident but obviously, my character was skeptical and unenthusiastic to help. I honestly was also projecting my uncaring attitude because what the actual fuck.\n\nIncident 2: Bullies of Black Lake\n\nA shorter story because I got fed up very quickly.\n\nWith my other character, a Hufflepuff boy, another guy wanted to RP with him. He sort of implied wanting to ship but I didn\u2019t want to assume because it would have been rude (he stated his character was gay and specifically asked for \u2018which character was a boy\u2019). Pretty obvious ngl, but I just didn\u2019t say anything because I doubted there would be chemistry.\n\nWe decided to have them meet at the Black Lake. Again, no real plot in mind, just a simple meeting RP where they run into each other and maybe talk.\n\nI started the scene, having my boy just boredly hanging out at the lake. I think he was skipping stones but I can\u2019t remember. I thought he was just gonna have his character walk on scene and they would talk. That\u2019s what most people do in simple meeting RPs.\n\nDid he do that?\n\nNOPE!\n\nHis entrance was him being chased by NPC bullies that were making horse noises for some reason (he literally wrote that they were making horse noises) and chased him to the end of the pier and tried to make him jump into the water.\n\nNow, my character isn\u2019t a bad person that would let something bad happen to other people. He\u2019s a chill and helpful guy. But why are you trying to blindside me with a situation where my character HAS TO SAVE YOUR CHARACTER?! \n\nMy character ended up standing to the side, tbh. I just couldn\u2019t work up enough empathy to try and save this rando.\n\nAll in all, as much as I try to make my characters into good people, I really hate when people try to turn turn a simple RP into a situation where my character has to save there\u2019s because 9/10, I\u2019m not going to want to. I know it makes me sound like a bit of an asshole, but unless it\u2019s plotted where the interaction would be helping them out of a bad situation, I really can\u2019t formulate what they expect me to do in that scenario that\u2019s also within me staying in character.",

Of those, each one of us had one that we'd started with, which I considered our mains. But the story included a heist, which saw our mains adopting several other people to join the adventure.\n\nLong story short, sometime three months into the writing, we got to a point where we needed to jump forward in time to continue the story. It was one of those \"and then the party traveled to their next destination\" kind of moments.\n\nSince it was my partner's turn and they wanted to do the first post after the timeskip, I was perfectly happy to let them take the reigns.\n\nThey wrote the post. It basically boiled down to:\n\n* partner's main character commits heinous act during the timeskip\n* my main character was punished for it\n* my main character is no longer alive\n* their character is sad about this turn of events\n\nI know RP is about rolling with the punches, I get that. But that just pissed me off. My suggestion: don't kill off characters in an RP without discussing it with your partner first. This is not the sort of surprise anyone wants to get when they log into Discord in the morning.",

            "selftext": "So, I\u2019m a new roleplayer. And when I say new, I mean I started this hobby like a weeks ago. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m completely inexperienced: I have played D&amp;D before as well as other roleplaying games. Plus, while I don\u2019t quite know the format of roleplaying, I have been writing for a long time and I understand things like setting a scene, describing the character's actions and thoughts. While I\u2019m nowhere near an expert at writing I do think I don\u2019t completely suck at it.\n\nMy question is: since this is the first time I have been RPing, I\u2019m not sure what the length of my replies should be. As of right now, my lower has been about 250 words and the longest 830. My average as of right now is around 400 words per reply. Is that normal?\n\nIt normally takes me around half an hour, between writing and checking the grammar (I\u2019m not a native English speaker so I use some programs to help me). But that is only when I\u2019m on the computer all day. Most of the time it takes me around 1 to 2 hours to respond, and in some cases longer. I can\u2019t be connected 24/7 and I have let that known to the few people I have RPed so far. That\u2019s why I do longer replies, for them to take their time to make theirs.\n\nI suppose my question is if that\u2019s the norm? I\u2019m a very self-conscious individual, and all I want to know if I\u2019m not fucking up right now. So far I have enjoyed this hobby - and haven\u2019t come across some of the examples of stories in this sub - so I wanted to see if I\u2019m \u201cdoing it correctly\u201d.\n\nEdit: I started a week ago, not two.",

            "selftext": "Been doing some time reflecting on roleplaying recently after having left and seen roleplay groups go down, I'm going to quit forever. I hope that I can stay away from it and not be tempted to come back. \n\nThroughout roleplaying, my expectations of myself and others of it would cause me to not find many partners. I\u2019ve had many bad rp stories and no good rp stories, it\u2019s why I found this subreddit because it was nice to see I wasn\u2019t alone in my rp struggles and failures. Roleplaying may not have been the right hobby for me but I still did it anyway. Think that's why I was rping for so long it created a \u201csink cost fallacy\u201d scenario. It\u2019s like this: \u201cI\u2019ve been rping for so long that if I quit now it would all be for nothing, a waste\u201d.\n\n\nSo to not let it all go to waste, I plan to to post rp lore/plotline I made and translate them to my original stories. That way, retcons won't happen, characters stay consistently in the story. As well as no Mary Sues, powerplay, metagame, etc.\n\nThough I lack friends, a following, etc, it\u2019s gonna be difficult. I\u2019m not even sure if my stories will get any traction but even if all fails I think finishing my stories would be enough. It could help bring a sense of peace and control over this activity that brought me a ton of negative baggage.\n\nWould\u2019ve been nice to continue, be part of a community but it\u2019s time for me to close this chapter in my life. At least I tried.",

            "selftext": "So I - very - briefly joined this discord RP group centered around a murder plot that takes place in this young adult book series. In this book series, dead characters sometimes visit the protagonists in dreams if they have some sort of connection with them. That was a strong element in this RP group. \n\nThing was, apparently in THIS group a dead character can just appear to whoever they want in the waking world and shoot the shit. They didn\u2019t mention this anywhere in the lore, but it was immediately obvious to me how this could completely derail the murder plot. I mean, what\u2019s stopping a player who\u2019s character may be murdered from coming back and telling everyone who the killer is? \n\nThe conversation I had about it went something like this:\n\nMe: if someone\u2019s character is murdered... what\u2019s stopping them from coming back and telling everyone what happened? \n\nHead Writer (HW): well, the owner of the character is the one stopping them.\n\nMe: ok, but, why wouldn\u2019t a pissed off, murdered character tell everyone who killed them?\n\nHW: (basically what they said) because that would give away the murderer, so you shouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nSo, yeah... the plot hole had been ripped open and I couldn\u2019t not notice it. I didn\u2019t want to really stick around so I looked up how to leave an RP group with grace and was advised to say why, but to do so politely. I basically said that I didn\u2019t have a problem with anyone or the group as a whole, but their way of world building / RP-ing just wasn\u2019t my style. I also mentioned the plot hole and how I didn\u2019t really understand it. I waited to see if one of the head writers would either say \u201cokey dokey buh bye\u201d or maybe discuss my issues with it, since my character had a fairly important status in the group.\n\nOne of the writers immediately messaged me and their DM oozed passive aggressiveness. They seemed offended by me pointing out the plot hole and said I was welcome to leave. So... I did. Just kind of irritating.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm here once again to share a story of horror. I'm on mobile bc of course I am, so apologies in advance. \n\nSo, to start off I was on one of those random connect sites (think Shamchat, omegle, rolechat, etc) and I came across an invite to a server for a Marvel High school rp. I thought it could be fun since I have a lot of fun playing teen heroes. Who i was isn't too important, what makes this a horror story is, Steve Rogers.\n\nI can't honestly say I've met a more ooc Steve in my entire life. Just as a note, this was a high school au where everyone had their powers still and were training to become heroes (think avengers academy) except Steve. The Steve in that server was a pre-serum one. Which in itself was totally fine, i really love the lil punk that is Steve no matter the form he takes. The problems my friends, was as follows.\n\n1. He was a femboy who really loves skirts, glitter, wigs and makeup (plus he was a little in a Ddbg) . Now while everyone is free to take own interpretations of characters this is personally a small pet peeve of mine. Usually because of the stereotypes behind small men having to be feminine and girly.\n\n2. He was a bully. Yes that's right, Steve Rogers was a bully. As in example, he would often call the things that my character talked about as stupid, lame, or gross. Act bratty and like a child. Was mentally unstable as all hell. He would insult people, make fun of them or whatever else.  And no one really seemed to care. \n\n3. The toxic relationship he was in with the Tony. It was honestly cringey at times however the best example of it was that after Tony insinuated breaking up with Steve, Steve then basically had a mental breakdown at the hospital he was recovering in had to be restrained, drugged as he was attempting to hurt himself and others. Plus how they got back together is just as bad. It was basically a guilt trip situation.\n\n\n5. People understood that he was ooc. The even admitted that if this Steve tried to pick up Thor's hammer he'd fail. Which kind of made me realize that people knew he was ooc, they just didn't care.\n\nI left only after a few days, stayed that long bc I met this absolutely great and fantastic person there whom I'm currently in a 1 on 1 rp with. She's also going to leave due to the same issues. \n\nI honestly believe that the person controlling Steve is just using him as some sort of self insert bc there's no way you can get that character that wrong. It was the major factor I left, and when someone did reach out to me I did explain my issues with other players being ooc (I didn't out them specifically) haven't heard or had a problem since then. Tho my current rp partner who is still in the server keeps me updated from time to time on what crazy crap is going on.",

I do not like first person, I feel like it limits me.  \n\n\nBut I am willing to do it but that means you'll have to deal with the lack of detail. I don't think people realize how much harder it is, since in third person you can write waaay more detail. If you like first person? good for you!  I not nor ever give you flack for it. But if you have me do it, don't get mad at me when a person whose normally third person, doesn't add much detail.  \n\n\nI've had this happen a lot in rp, and encounter a lot of people who rp in first, again its perfectly fine, I have no issues with it. But I personally don't like doing it. I won't complain if the two rping styles are different. But I always get messages asking \"little more detail?\" WELL WHAT DO I WRITE ABOUT? I'm not gonna go on and on about my characters feelings about a dang pebble or trees, because yes while they're very neat, I don't wanna go on about it. Its not like what my character is doing was very interesting in that moment anyways. I love rping but I hate when it feels forced just to fill up to a paragraph.  I legit cannot tell you how many times I've had this happen. Again, it's not the first person thing in general but the people who get mad at you for not doing it exactly how they want it. And if I say it makes me uncomfortable, please don't force me to do it, continuing to beg me to do it only makes me more uncomfortable with it.  \n\n\nI'm sorry if this seems kinda pointless, but I wanna know if I'm the only one whose had experiences like this?   \n\n\nI do wanna point out that sometimes first person can be helpful! I just- if I'm doing long rp where I wanna use detail about surrounding the characters can't see, I can't add that to third person.",
