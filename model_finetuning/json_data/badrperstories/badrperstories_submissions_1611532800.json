            "selftext": "I want to list some types of bad roleplayers who I have come across while posting my searches. Is there a different type you want to add?\n\n**Jared:**\n\nOne of the most common types. They haven't read your search, at all. Will contact you with something like 'Hey, wanna roleplay?' and if you reply, often ask for something that is the opposite of what you are looking for (fandoms you are not part of, nsfw instead sfw, and so on). If you ask them if they have even read your search, they answer 'Nah, I just contacted you because you posted a search soooo I thought you were looking for a roleplay.'\n\n**'You should compromise more':**\n\nThey have read your search, and they are vocal about not being interested in...basically any topic you mentioned there. But they say that your general preference and 'about me' part have caught their eye and they are very intrigued by it, so maaaaybe, you could roleplay with them regardless and you would end up being great partners.\n\nThey ask you if you might be interested in writing something else. If you ask them what they have in mind, it is often oddly specific and ridiculously far away from what you were looking for, like 'Yeah, I am looking for an mxm nsfw roleplay. You have to use young Johnny Depp as a faceclaim, while I use Richard Gere. It will be about a criminal and his lawyer, and take place in Florida in the 80s.'\n\nWhen you tell them that your ad states that you don't feel comfortable to write nsfw, or use real faceclaims and this mentioned in your ad under general preferences (and you also know nothing about Florida or being a lawyer), they will complain about people who are prudes and never compromise, block you and be never heard from again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Guilt-Tripper:**\n\nThis person seems like they have read the ad, and everything seems to go smoothly at the start. Until you notice that they are always ranting ooc about something that is included in your search under boundaries.\n\nFor example, you can only write once or twice a week while they are someone who replies every day or more, and they always talk ooc about how annoyed they are by one of their roleplay partners who can only write once a week. When you politely mention that your ad states that this is true for you too, the reply with something like 'Yeah, I read your ad, but if you are really into writing the roleplay you will also reply more often. I work 10 hours each day AND study and I am always able to reply at least once a day, so it shouldn't be a problem for you, right?'\n\nIf you ignore this red flag, but tell them you can't change your post frequency (that they will have to live with it or leave) and just move on with planning the roleplay, this will end most likely  two weeks later with them screaming at you about why you are not interested in the roleplay, how they wasted so much time writing with you, and if you don't get any better soon, they will have to delete the roleplay.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you have mentioned your post-frequency about 20 times, you are an evil person who has wasted their precious time and in fact, you can be glad that they are still keeping up with someone as disgusting as you.\n\n**The sneaky one:**\n\nThey are super nice, have obviously read your search, and the planning phase is great. Until it comes to actually roleplaying.\n\nMoments before you are meant to start, they will suddenly try to change a core aspect of the roleplay, for example like 'Yeah, I always thought the part about vampires being discriminated against was stupid, so we will not include it./I never liked roleplays about conflicts between characters, so let's start with our characters being friends instead.'\n\nNevermind that several of your characters have this as an important part of their backstory, or that the characters being rivals who hate each other was the aspect you were explicitly looking for in your search. If you tell them that this is kind of...not the roleplay you were looking forward to anymore, they just shrug and want to start the roleplay regardless.\n\n**The one who can not differentiate between roleplay and personal life:**\n\nThis person also seems to be nice at first. They are great at planning, but suddenly you notice that there is...something off about them. Although their ideas for the roleplay are okay, their interest in your personal life and their fixation on what gender or sexual orientation you have is definitely not. I am not talking about people who like to know about about you ooc. But this person is very open about the fact that they might be interested in becoming your in real life boyfriend (or girlfriend) if the roleplay goes well and you get along great.As soon as you make it clear that this will never, ever happen, they suddenly lose all interest in the roleplay and never reply again.",

They straight up lied about being married whilst doing a NSFW roleplay with me and very heavily flirting with me OOC. \n\nWhen I found out and confronted them, they admitted they didn't tell me because they were afraid I'd be disappointed or disgusted if I found out.

Got to know them ooc a little bit and we were posting back and forth with a good pace. We slowed down, which is okay life happens. They hadn\u2019t posted for a few days, which again, is okay since life happens. So when I checked Discord today I was shocked and a little disheartened to see they had deleted our server and blocked me without a warning or any heads up. I\u2019ve always found it awkward to ask a roleplay partner if everything is okay because personally I\u2019d hate being rushed and constantly bothered, so I usually give it a week and send one message and leave it alone, unless they reply. (And I guess that could\u2019ve been a fault as to why they deleted the server and blocked me.) It kinda just makes me want to take a break from roleplaying since now I am wondering what I did wrong and questioning my writing ability, it really just messed with my confidence in writing. \n\nI\u2019d hate for it to happen to someone else, so please let someone know.",

The chat seemed alright, though they insisted on keeping IC and OOC to separate chats and the other owner (the SO of the friend who invited me) got mad at me over it BEFORE there was actually an official OOC chat to separate OOC conversations into.\n\nOnce that was resolved I asked for the second time how things are meant to work in the chat, which had an interdimensional hotel setting, I was told that you should just chose a location in the hotel and have your character do things there and let anyone who wants to interact with them jump in.\n\nNow, I wont claim my muses are perfect or anything, but for the first 2 days everything I posted in main was completely ignored, and any attempt to ask if I was doing something wrong was met with accusations of trying to make everything about myself. When I did eventually get something it was from someone else who'd been ignored for an entire day who probly decided \"Fuck it, the muse this guy presented is close enough to my type and they don't have anything\" and/or responded to my prompt out of pity.\n\nThis cycle continued for a week or so, occasionally I'd get something small off a prompt of mine, or post something on someone else's prompt that they don't just pretend didn't happen, but it always ended with me being casually ignored when someone they liked more got on. In one case, the friend who invited me to the server specifically made a scene for the two of us, only to shift the scene's focus to someone else paired with their muse after like, 5 posts back and forth.\n\nThe breaking point for me was when I posted a prompt of a muse of mine in the hotel's lobby, and then shortly after someone else wrote a very similar prompt of a different character with pretty much the same body type as mine doing nearly the same thing in the same location without even a passing mention to the character who was already there, and that second prompt got picked up by someone almost instantly. \n\nI was eventually banned from the chat for getting mad when the chat's owner (my friend's SO) declared that everyone on the site he was running a chat on was beneath him. It crashed and burned about a week later for reasons unrelated to me.",

The current line is in the sand and a hard no, but they don't mind because OTP is stable (which isn't bad, good thing to be completely fair). Partner's OTP other half is a character mine is diametrically opposed to - we RP a fandom RP and these chars don't tend to get along (thing Goku and Vegeta in the early seasons), and historically I have not had great relationships OOC with the player being OTP. This isn't always the OTP player's fault, and I'm willing to go 60/40 my fault. This current player, however, I like just fine. They play the character well, we have fun being salty to each other OOC but that's where it stays. We're polite if not downright nice to each other OOC and in DM. It's pleasant. \n\nNow, Partner and I were playing about a month ago, and my stubborn character is being stubborn. I think things are going fine until I get a DM from Partner to the tune of \"Why can't your char just support mine!?\" Which, aside from being something they wouldn't do with reference to OTP, it isn't something we've discussed as a problem. \n\nThe situation goes sideways as I'm hardly one to back down unfortunately and when I do apologize that my actions IC hurt them, Partner goes off on how my apology is \"BS.\" Bear in mind, my apology clearly accepted that I did something that hurt them, while their's often contain \"if I did something.\" \n\nSo I snap and tell them if they can't actually apologies (correctly) for blowing something out of proportion I don't need them. \n\nIt's been a few weeks at this point, and I don't expect to ever hear from them again, but I still have that bad taste in my mouth.

My friends aren\u2019t into roleplay so I have nowhere else to vent. \n\nAbout a few months ago, I posted an ad and got responses. Simple right? Well not so much. \n\nWe get into details about characters, trying to see if our characters jive together. \n\nShe plain and simple has a Mary Sue in my eyes. Her character was a medical student, a ballerina, and did something else (I think a barista?) all on top being a uwu shy bookworm nerd girl. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s feasible for someone to be all of that, but personally, I like simple. Not flat. Simple.  I didn\u2019t want to spend most of the roleplay focusing on her character going to ballet classes, college, barista, etc. it just.... read like a YA main character. Her character seemed like it would just take over the story. \n\nSo I just politely said her character wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. \n\nShe then proceeds to insult me, telling me that I don\u2019t know how to make a complex character and that her OC was perfectly fine. The problem was me! I was the evil nay-sayer! I didn\u2019t even say anything was wrong with your oc, dude.... I just said I didn\u2019t care for her. \n\nHonestly, the most prominent thing I remember from this interaction is BURSTING OUT LAUGHING. I can\u2019t even remember if I responded. I just laughed and deleted the DMs on discord (I tried to find them, but sadly you can\u2019t pull up deleted DMs on discord unless you have the user ID.) \n\nBONUS STORY\nThis roleplayer put an F4A ad, I responded. We get chatting and says she has a plot but it\u2019s for mxm NSFW rp. I politely say ehh I am a homosexual woman. I don\u2019t really want to write about that kinda stuff. \n\nUm. She implies something is wrong with me because she is also a lesbian and roleplaying NSFW MxM? [screenshot here. ](https://imgur.com/a/8xPdjOB)\n\nHuh????????????? what. \n\nI honestly see now why they had negative karma on their profile. How rude to gatekeep what does or does not make me uncomfortable. Usually I get that sh*t from male role players! \n\nI have some hilarious stories of men trying to RP lesbians but I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. Thanks for reading this far. \n\nTLDR: people do be taking this too seriously",

            "selftext": "I swear, 80% of the roleplayers I meet are incredibly self-absorbed. It translates into their roleplay, where they do next to nothing to actually engage or get to know other characters around them in order to create impactful interactions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally just had someone ask to play with me, then jump into a scene where my character was already established, only to go on about how amazing her character was, then fail to actually do or say anything to engage my character at all, putting the onus on me. I don't mind instigating sometimes, but I could tell from this persons ims that she was only interested in herself. Her subsequent posts built little on mine, and were yet again very focused on her own character. Wonderful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I love about RP is the challenge/puzzle-solving/character development/rapport (negative or positive) with other characters. Chemistry requires a to and fro, and I like to try to give and take. Unfortunately, I'm so tired of players who are only interested in their (usually sparkly special princess) type characters, that I will bail at the first red flag, which tends to narrow down my play-pool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst are the ones who simply seem to decide that my character needs to ship with theirs regardless of its temperament or proclivities. It just leads to a fairly shallow/worthless sort of interaction to me, and it's such a shame, because I think these players are probably doing this to everyone and commonly running into ghosting and other issues.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so in lieu of a karma court or AITA type sub for this niche interest, I thought I'd put forward the situation I just went through and hope that I don't get slaughtered too badly.\n\nSo anyways, I recently ended a few long-time RPs a while back, and decided to get back into what is arguably the worst part of RPing, combing through forums and sites to find a partner that can make things work. Having spent a long time with my previous RP partners, I was comfortably ignorant of the scary outside world of RP partner searching, and I thought that those days were long gone (at least for a decent amount of time). So when I dove back in headfirst into a few subreddits I wasn't sure of what to expect.\n\nThe first few DMs got responses, but they went nowhere. Partners just didn't get the feel of things, or I felt that they weren't what they had said on their posts, or the dreaded ghost syndrome reared its ugly head and things eventually died a slow painful death. Expected, all things considered. Either way, if communications were still being made either one of us would tell the other that things weren't working, or there would be an uncomfortable moment where we both said we were busy and there was an understanding that that was probably the end. There were of course, a few ghosts, one of which was (full disclosure) by me. After I had written up some detailed bios for a few characters, my partner ended up writing nothing like their partner\u2013searching post and that immediately set off red flags for me.\n\nSo after a few failed attempts, i decided to strike out on my own, and made my own post to hopefully get people to come to me, instead of the other way around. People who took the time to respond to me would surely be interested in making something work, surely.\n\nAnd there were responses, I was glad and decided to pursue as many of them as possible, expecting one or two ghosts. Sure enough a responder added me on a chatting service, then promptly ignored my messages and ended up blocking me a day or two later. Another pair are still tentatively in the planning stage, and there were some quickfire starts that fizzled out after the first day.\n\nThe one partner I ended up being kinda upset about was a response that I had initially held high hopes for. The exchange on a certain platform ended up being short and stilted, and basically 24+ hour long waits with 0 plans having been made, and no communication about availability or how often we would be able to communicate, or if either one of us were busy and needed time to respond. Having experienced plenty of ghostings already, I expected the worst and decided to give them a firm (and a little passive-aggressive) message, asking them if they were still interested.\n\nHere is where the AITA part comes around, about an hour after my message, they reply and mention being sick with a potentially serious illness, and needing time to go to the hospital. They then mention that it's only been 2 days, despite there having not been anything besides a simple response to my initial greeting. I apologised about the illness, and thanked them for letting me know. I tried to repair things as well as possible and told them that if they were still keen on RPing, I'd respect their privacy and they could let me know whenever. At this point i was just happy to have received a response for what I thought was a ghosting. \n\nThey then decided to bring up the fact again that it had only been 2 days, despite there having been no intent to let me know that they would be dealing with something serious. That is where the exchange ended on their end. \n\nI guess the question I had is, did I overreact? Is it normal for new partners to add you on a chatting service, then not let you know if they'll be busy? I feel like a serious illness is something you let people know about straight up, not bring up when they ask you if you're still interested in RPing. I'm not disputing the veracity of their illness, but that feels like something you should mention initially so your new partner isn't left completely in the dark. \n\nI've probably soured things and made it awkward, which means I lost a great potential writing buddy, so that's something I regret. But as someone who came back into RPing having enjoyed a private scene for a long time, should I have given them more time? How do people try to gauge interest at the very beginning when there hasn't been much communication and with a lack of knowledge? I understand giving people time to write up passages in RPs but with previous partners, the organisation and setting\u2013things\u2013up aspect of the exchange was always done a little faster, relatively.\n\nI'd appreciate advice and thoughts about this awkward initial start-up period, do you put more emphasis on faster communication and chatting initially? As I mentioned, I've regressed in my partner finding skills fairly noticeably, so I would like to pick people's brains about this.\n\n\\------\n\nHopefully I left enough detail out so that nobody will think it's them. If you do end up reading this, I really am sorry about what happened, I did think I would enjoy RPing with you, and I hate the way things turned out.",

            "selftext": "Yo yo yo, I am back with *even more* chaos. I'm also writing this while half of my screen is covered by the deadly laser sun, so if anything looks weird that's why. Anyway, obligatory 'This is a *long one*', 'English is not my first language' and link to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/l2njfh/oh_and_your_families_were_killed_in_front_of_you/) but I will try to summarise it in a TDLR here seeing how long it is. Additionally, this one IS WORSE than the previous one mostly with what will be mentioned, so a **potential trigger warning for slurs, racism, ticks, hanging, toxicity etc.** So, let's start this dive. Also also x2, I will be putting in some memes to keep you all sane along with image evidence - minus the ones with slurs unless anyone wants to see them then I could dm to prove that I'm telling the truth, idm - so whenever you see any link, no worries, it's just an image.\n\n**TLDR from part one**; my friend **K** and me were vibing in a VC when he told me about an RP he wants to app his character to, which caused me and few other friends to join in. The server was immediately giving out several red flags but we trusted **K** and stayed. We got in and the RP just went to utter shit.\n\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone of the cast, along with a few new additions that became important:\n\n\\-Fiyu, aka **me**;\n\n\\-Kai, aka **K**;\n\n\\-Min, aka **M**;\n\n\\-San, aka **S**;\n\n\\-Oda, aka **P;**\n\n\\-Yuu, aka **Y;**\n\n\\-Entitled Brat, aka **J;**\n\n\\-The Mod, aka just **Mod;**\n\n\\-Our friend, who'd we call **Treasure** \\- cus how she handled the situation just makes her a National Treasure;\n\n\\-And few unimportant characters I will be mentioned once or twice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now that this is established, let's start from where we ended off last time.\n\nSo, me, **K** and **Y** had moved away from the motive area and to the hotel lobby, where **M, S** and **P** were interacting. We vibed together, introduced each other and that and it was then that we were called *ONCE AGAIN* to the docks for the motive.\n\nNow, I will derail a bit in order to talk about how important pacing is in Roleplays; for those who are DRRPers or have been in veeeery long and complex Roleplays. you know how important it is to pace everything out - to give everyone enough time to investigate, interact with everyone, grow some sort of connection and establish themselves. This is why, on average(at least in my community), chapters take around month to month and a half to finish as we want to give everyone enough time to interact, investigate then react to the motive, feel the consequences of it and then have the murder happen. Usually, there's a new area, a week later is a motive and depending on how long the case takes, two weeks after is a murder with a new area being revealed a week later. \n\nBut pacing here? Oh boy. I can't remember the timings precisely cus my sense of time is fucked up after staying inside for so long - thanks quarantine and covid - but it wasn't even a week and today we are supposed to have a *SECOND AREA REVEAL*. Everything was happening so fast I didn't even manage to finish ONE interaction with ANYONE. It literally went roughly like this: Start of RP, the day later motive, two days later murder - I'll talk about this one later, don't worry, it is a clusterfuck on its own - trial another day later and then a day later another area reveal; so yes, the pacing wasn't really existing in this roleplay.\n\nBack to the story; so we go back to the docks yet again and the motive is revealed, and what is it? DO you remember when I mentioned that we are stranded on an island? Maybe I didn't, but if I didn't then here. So. We are stranded on an island, and the motive is that the entire area will flood if no one kills??? Which is first, how do 2 12-year olds - yes those are the mascots in that game - do that???? And second, aren't they gonna destroy the buildings too?? I never researched floods that much cus I was never interested/didn't have a character that experienced a flood but from what I've seen on documentaries, Geography lesson and news reports, floods destroy A LOT of shit, even when the water isn't there. The motive *could have* worked as a very late motive out of desperation, but at the beginning? Not really. It's just shooting your own foot at that point.\n\nBut this wasn't all! Thanks to our little group apping all smart people - minus me but oh well, sometimes you just need to roleplay a dumb mascot child - the idea of a raft came up! After **Treasure** was giving us a Heathcliff'svery good insight into what would happen if we'd stay in salty water too much and all that, the plan was put into motion as everyone went to the jungle. So, with the power of Heathcliff's \"Fuck all Y'all\" from SAOA, we decided to ignore everyone else and focus on our raft. So we are interacting there, building it until two days ago; I remind you, we've been there the entire time, and no one entered minus another character we'll call **Amanda.** So, we are vibing, two more people enter(for the record, they were chill, so if you are reading this, no hate goes to you two) and then **Amanda** enters. She screams about killing the trees, yada yada, and suddenly, the **Mod** tells us to look around. Confused, all of us look around and outa nowhere, there it was. A dead body. Hanging from a tree.\n\nNow, JUST THAT, gave me more red flags. You might be asking, \"Why? This is a killing game after all! You are supposed to kill each other and investigate, no?\", well lemme tell ya this case was **fucking shit.** First, the killing form is vague as fuck and doesn't have anything good in it, [here's what the form wanted us to fill in.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/520963607186636800/803573032240152626/Untitled.png?width=285&amp;height=610) If you are a DRRPer, you can clearly see the problem here, and this is not the worst thing that happened. So. You know how we were there the entire time? And none of us did it(I knew it was none of us cus we were close as to who wants to do what there)? Well, it was someone else, obviously! But how could have they killed in a jungle when we were there? At another time? Well, we don't know that because upon asking the **Mod** if we will get alibis - you know, as you should - they said that they are impossible to make for an RP and they would point towards the killer.\n\nAll of us are like [\"??????\"](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/520963607186636800/803575596591874078/unknown.png); most of us in that group wrote alibis at one point, bah I've been writing them for the past few months due to being a Mod in another server and also being in cases before. Alibis **AREN'T** impossible! They are hard, yes, especially at the beginning when you don't have a lot of areas but have a shit ton of characters but that's why you have the strategic alibi of \"You've slept/were in your room the entire time.\" And regarding the second point, uhm... Isn't that what alibis are supposed to do??? There are alibi-heavy trials and they point to the killer along with the evidence? Why do you think DR games and every other murder-mystery games use alibis, lmao. \n\nTo quote John Mulaney, \"The party was going great.\"\n\nSo, after being called 'Blind' because we didn't see the body by the Entitled Brat, people went to investigate while me and **P** vibed in the kitchen or somewhere else cus Fiyu doesn't know what death is. Or investigation, so she was pretty clueless. So 'we vibing', episode #53. Nothing in RP was really happening, and what was happening will be covered and touched on in a while. So, people are investigating, we are discussing it in VC and another server and the case is pretty damn obvious, so we think that the trial won't take more than 30 minutes. Were we right?\n\nHahahahahahhahahhahaha **no**\n\nIt lasted for 2 hours.\n\nNow, as I once replied to one post, I've been in long trials and I've enjoyed them - but that was because there was love and hard work put into them to make them possible. I don't care if the trial is 3 or 5 hours or shorter - as long as it IS a good case and I can see that the mods and everyone involved tried their best, even if the case flops in some way, it happens. But here? The case didn't take any time to create, no alibis, no proper evidence. nothing. It was obvious who the killer was and I see no fucking reason why that trial took more than 2 hours to conclude. But it did. The killer that suddenly appeared in the jungle as we were vibing there **- Amanda** \\- got executed and area reveal was scheduled for the next day. Aka today at the time of writing it, however, none of us will participate in it because we left. Why? Well, we are getting to the juicy parts now.\n\nSo, I'll first cover the OOC and then a certain character. So, the triggers start here cus HOOOO BOI, this made me GENUINELY CONCERNED for first time in ages. Let's start unwrapping as much as I can remember. So. Yeah. The atmosphere was really, *really* wack there, and not in a good way. The people there used slurs constantly such as f\\*\\* and re\\*\\*rd when one of the rules was 'no slurs'. So yeah - me and my friends grew really uncomfortable. We didn't say anything though, because we were already on thin ice. What happened next? Oh boi.\n\nSo. You all know My Little Pony, yeah? And by this, I mean the show, not the fandom - tho I have no problems with either, fyi, I've used to love the show. If you don't then in nutshell, it is a show about the importance of friendship and all. So. You can imagine my surprise when I see the general lit up and I see them **saying how Twilight is racist.** \n\nI WAS IN SHOCK - both me and my friend, who's a bigger fan than me. It was like???? What???? And Spike is a Chad? They also said something more shit about him but I can't remember but it's like??? What??? Who hurt you if you think MLP OF ALL THINGS IS RACIST??? They were going on and on and I was just \"??????\" Da fuq? It was a fucking trip, I tell you. You wanna know something more fucked up though? \n\nThey joke - a lot - about hating gays and mental illness. I'm not kidding. There was one joke that just made me genuinely angry. Someone said that: \n\n\"I have a feeling most if not all people here(ooc note: they mean the server) are mentally ill.\"\n\nAnd **Y** replied:\n\n\"Yeah, I think it comes with either being a roleplayer being somewhere in the lgbt community or danganronpa maybe being its all three\"\n\nAnd I just sit there???? Dumbfounded??? WHAT THE FUCK???? This is insensitive, ignorant and fucking tasteless as a MERE JOKE. It's so fucking wrong to say something like this? Like, I'm not saying that those *couldn't* influence someone's mental health(bah, I know it did influence mine) but generalizing EVERYONE among those three communities? What??? The fuck??? Also, to assume everyone is mentally ill is just???? No???? What the fuck????\n\nIt was just... A trip. All of us called them out of it - while being civil of course - and they said it was a joke and it's like??? Fuck your joke??? It's fucking insensitive???\n\nNow... There was much more shit but I've been writing this for a long while and we didn't even got to the Entitled kid and what made us all leave. I might do a follow up if people want to? Not like there's more to say because everything else is just E there but yeah. Anyway. To the Entitled Kid.\n\nSo. This... This person. I will probably sound insensitive, but this character filled me with so much range. If I had to describe him in one sentence, it would be: A kid that abuses 'I am mentally ill' card. I'm not kidding. But to the story. Entitled Kid, roleplayed by **J**, was apparently suffering from retard syndrome/stunned mental growth or something like this, my brain is a mush, I can't remember the proper phrase right now, I'm sorry. Anyway. So they said they have it and I'm like \"oh, ok, that's fine, I know few people with that.\" but when he started roleplaying with the Entitled Kid... Oh... Oh my God... It was **painful** to watch. He blamed every inappropriate outburst on ticcs - again, valid, but that's the cause not an excuse - and whenever someone called him out on that, he started yelling out that they are ableist??? Genuinely, one of our characters told him to shut up cus he wasn't contributing properly and he called them ableist when they were polite about it? Then **J** has the fucking attitude to go into the character discussion and cry that no one likes the Entitled Kid and I'm like??? You aren't making him likeable at all!\n\nNow, I know there are extreme cases of it because mental illness is a wide spectrum - you could have more mild symptoms while someone else has extremes of it. I know that - but I also know that this is a harmful portrayal of it. Like I've said before, I've met and interacted with people like the Entitled Kid is supposed to be - additionally, my mom used to work with them before she changed jobs so she has EVEN more experience. And both of us - along with others that seen it - figured out this was a harmful portrayal of it. Especially since everyone excused it? Again, I know what ticcs are and they cant be controlled, but you can't just let them slide. You either take medication, therapy or whatever else your doctor prescribed you; oh, and for SURE you can't allow such behaviour. At least tell him it's not good???? Honestly, his character was an uncomfortable mess that tossed 'ableism' and slurs as if they were nuts for the squirrels at a park. It was just???? No??? The more he talked and how he behaved, it seemed more like he was consciously using his disability for attention cus I have hard time believing that someone with that syndrome would keep calling people that.\n\nAgain. This is from my experience and knowledge. If I am wrong, I apologize, however it doesn't change the fact that the character made multiple people uncomfortable and used slurs when there was a **FUCKING RULE ABOUT NOT USING THEM!**\n\nAnd don't even bring the 'slur reclaiming' into it; I don't care who you are, if the rules say no slurs, everyone should obey them. One for all and all for one. \n\nAnd now, if you are still here, the reason why all of us decided to spare ourselves the suffering. So. Remember **Treasure**? She was watching the trial with us and she asked a question about the Entitled Kid. She was civil and polite, and yet everyone jumped on her, insulting her as if she just killed their mother? A drama broke out as all of us jumped in to somehow ease it up because it was getting out of hand FAST; they were more toxic than the chemical fumes. There were few people from that circle that also tried to settle it down, but the damage was done. While **Treasure** was taken into DMs with **J,** I pinged the group in a server where we were discussing it to ask about the course of action. After some discussion, we decided that them teaming up against **Treasure** was the last card, and so, all of us left.\n\nThis is probably the end of this story. There are few places that I didn't go into detail, but that's because I've been trying to write this shitshow up for around two hours and my brain is a fucking mush at this point. If there will be any updates, I will either add it here or make another post if it will be big enough. \n\nOver, my thoughts on this server are summed up pretty well with this one [video.](https://youtu.be/AzjbvLwivd8) \n\nRegardless, thank you if you read it all, and I wish you all the luck to avoid such shitshows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; shit goes fucking bad and after a drama all of us decide to leave the server with what little sanity we have left.",

Also sorry if the format ends up weird, I'm on mobile.\n\nA little background on the situation; I have been writing this character (on tumblr) for about 6 years now. Different partners, different stories, a lot of growth both for me and my character, and I've become attached to him. \n\nBack in 2018 I've met such an amazing rp partner and since then, they've been my main. Our characters have a family together and my character's life kinda revolves around them. He has a bunch of friends whom he talks with almost on the daily but it's just chats, I'm not really able to write a lot lately. \n\nAfter about a year and half (ngl I'm surprised I even got that much) the other mun would be busy with stuff irl but I understood that bcz shit happens. I never pressured them to be online or whatever, sometimes I'd just check up on them cause I'd be a lil worried, especially with the virus nowadays. \n\nBut now they've been gone for SO long and I only get a few replies once every few months :^( and the replies are just chat based, can't even dream of semi-para or whatever.. I dont wanna sound like a whiny, pushy partner but at the same time I miss them and the story, and my character's life is moving forward without their character and I'm running out of excuses. Like I cant go around telling everyone I rp with that my main partner has been gone for like a year or so.. \n\nSo um, please help? We haven't talked since October when they messaged me to apologize for not being online and for feeling shitty about it.. I replied saying that I understand and that \"I'm willing to wait\" (\ud83d\ude44) but they've never messaged back :^(( \n\nI'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do..",

            "selftext": "Hello\n\nThis story had happened a few months ago, however it's too good for not being told.   \nI joined this group and everything was pretty exciting. I came from a mostly fandom and 1x1 background, but then I got invited to join this group. Everything seemed to be great, the people were nice, the lore was huge and all the thing they told me sounded lovely. So I made my character. I never made oversexualized personalities  and will never. So I plotted with the owner of the group and everything seemed fine. My first post rolled out and the other writers praised me (which boosted my ego).   \n\n\nAfter a few post, I noticed that the woman I was writing with was not happy with me. Even went to other writers to trash my character, until after a week she completely lost interest in my OC. I believe it had two reasons; my character didn't automatically be her little plaything (sexually and plotwise) and she started to be very competitive with me in the OOC chats, until she just completely ignored me. I was like \"Fine okay.\" and tried to play as my character otherwise and even made another character to pass the time meanwhile. \n\nThis owner's character were totally sexualized, huge, huuuuge tits and ass, but you were not allowed to be not into that. So basically she ripped off both of my characters with a new one of hers. She already had around 14 characters already and was simply a control freak. Everyone had to play their role in the queen bee's world. A friend of mine, got called stupid and more for playing his character, spotlights got stolen by her and every other writer praised as if she was a goddess. In her posts, she throws with big words around her as if she was the smartest human ever exists. If you don't do what she wants, your character gets killed almost instantly, no way back. She had control over everything and everyone and her characters are either stupid, make no sense or are straight up psychopaths.   \n\n\nAlso, this discord server had a huge problem with r\\*pe. Characters get r\\*ped fairly often, which I'm not okay with. They made such a big deal with nice sounding sentence, like \\*it's player driven\\*. No it's not. You could achieve everything simply to be her little b\\*tch and your character will get boiled down to just smut. I needed two weeks to figure that out and left. I heard, they still made fun of people who left the server, calling them trash and p\\*ssies. \n\nOne person, gawd I hate him so much, played a rat and I made a rat joke once. He got so pissed at me and took everything personal. He was a lunatic, haha. He killed me in OOC chat in the most graphic way possible, after Queen Bee told him that I ignored her. The reason why I didn't wrote back immediately was because I felt uncomfortable in those OOC sexual things all the time, which I'm allowed to not take part of it. \n\nSo yeah, ef this server. :D",

            "selftext": "This was inspired by a recent post by /u/anoukdaae :) I'm not diagnosing the person in that thread and I don't know what's going on with them, but I thought I'd list some issues indicative of personality disorder since it's on people's minds now. \n\nI take a strong interest in mental health. It's the career path I choose to follow in the future. I've found RP serves as an exploration of someone's personality. \n\nHere are the pointers I've found for narcissists. I was going to write about BPD, but I think I'd rather let someone experienced with it or someone who \\*has\\* it write that thread- the pointers I could write out may seem insensitive or unsupported. \n\n**These are not diagnostic criteria. Again, they are just pointers, red-flags and terrible signs.** \n\n\\---------------------\n\n**1. Making the roleplay all about them.** In a group RP, this would entail the NRPer sidelining other players and hogging a lot of attention. In 1x1, this involves the NRPer sidelining your characters and plotlines. A subtle way they do it is *ignoring* yours and making no comment on them. I\u2019ve even seen NRPers roleplay with *themselves* in 1x1 for extended periods (which can work, but they take it a step further). Furthermore, if they don't like a character of yours, that character will never be mentioned, interacted with or acknowledged- or if they are, it will be to kill them off or get them out of the picture. I've seen non-consensual timeskips and godmodding to this end. \n\n**2. Deconstructive criticism.** When they're threatened, for instance, by a new member of a server or a partner's abilities, they will invent ways to bring them down. This is similar to how narcissists in the real world deal with people with greater abilities such as high intelligence. 'It must be lonely being like that', 'You need street-smarts, not book-smarts', 'A piece of paper doesn't mean anything'.\n\nIn a roleplay; 'Long posts and large words don't make the story good', 'She is only in that pairing for vain and vapid reasons', 'That character is terrible, big words don't make a difference'. \n\nIn another thread, I detailed a server moderator getting angry and banning me because I explained what 'slice of life' was. He didn't know the definition. A normal person would inquire into it and be thankful to understand. The guy in this instance 'Ummm ok? What?', I explained, then he banned me after a squabble. All I did was list it in one of my roleplaying interests when asked of me. \n\n**3. Using jealousy and envy** in a romantic or social context to make themselves feel happier. The roleplayer will debase a main character of yours, for instance, by comparing them to their own. The NRPer wants you to think your characters aren't good enough and that they're lucky if they get anywhere. \n\nI've had roleplays where NRPers play a twin or a clone of another's character and then proceed to be better than them in every single way and highlight these criticisms. Clone plots such as that can be fun- I enjoy the chance to play my partner's characters, to express myself and them and explore them. Vice versa, I enjoy seeing my partner give mine a go. It's like seeing an actor play a new role. However, the NRPer sees it as a chance to *tell you how to do it right.*\n\n**4. They will never say sorry.** If they do, their apology is written or curated by someone else who has to put up with them on a daily basis. These apologies tend to pat the NRPer on the back a lot, dance around the point and have a lot of emojis. \n\n**5. Criticising parts of your real-life / trying to control your real life**. This comes into play specifically when they want more of your time. For example- you might have to pick up some full-time work. They'll say 'well shouldn't you be spending better?', 'Why would you need that job?'. In other words- 'You could roleplay with me, but you're too stupid, therefore I'm annoyed'. They don't actually know anything about your life- they project, guess and try to demean. \n\n**6. 'Empathic' characters.** This is a little niche, but I've noticed that NRPers who try to play an empathic, 'wise' character just come off as pretentious and strange. They don't demonstrate how they are actually wise or care for people- they just sound and look 'nice' and are very smart. This is generally how narcs try to look nice- they buy material things, give you gifts/favours, then expect to be seen as wise, mature and helpful. It's like how a young child would characterise Santa or Dumbledore- the kid doesn't *know* what makes him nice. They're too young to understand. \n\n**7. God-modding.** Nothing to be said here. Crazy powers, reading minds, making you feel small and helpless. \n\n\\---------------------\n\nThe person that I learned the majority of this from definitely had the disorder. I won't go into it- but they essentially admitted it outright and made it the RP's focus. It also became evident in OOC and interactions outside of roleplay. And unfortunately like a lot of people in my shoes, I still care for the person, though I've blocked them.",

            "selftext": "Hi all guys and gals once again as I bring you one that I hope will be the last chapters of a story I cannot almost bear anymore for how many depths it sunk under.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the background I shall try my best to explain to you people. Basically one year ago I started a server with my friends codename Dog and Owl. My very first post on reddit should have all the info you need about [that one hell of a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/i9q3c0/how_parasites_can_infect_your_server_and_your_mind/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). There was also this person, Wolf, which joined the server with us but then ultimately left and then cane back recently. The story will be about this friend of ours.\n\nAfter some intial scuffle with some admins at the beginning, some issues with the owner presence and a lot of fun too, at the marker of one year anniversary, we got [this issue right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/ik5vhl/i_hate_all_that_is_going_on/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [this other one](https://www.reddit.com/r/badrperstories/comments/jukfo1/a_love_situation_i_cannot_understand_am_i_being/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).\n\nBasically I never linked these two issues together to a culprit or even to be stringed together but ultimately, there is no possible way to say otherwise to start this story. The Wolf was responsible for both.\n\nShe unleashed a couple of friends to harass the server and ultimately even took a character of hers to distrupt a relationship that was going on. Both the events, to her misfortune, backfired. I banned the hell out of her trolls, I made my character Nova break up the relationship as she heard Augus sucked face with Wolf's character as someone suggested and finally she's developing some damn good plot points with other roleplayers away from her metaphorical house arrest.\n\nBut this is not the end of the story. Oh nononono this is just the tip of the damn iceberg of what I learnt in the past week. \nSo my partner always have been suspicious around this Wolf, and ultimately she was totally right and I thank her for that every day. \nWe learnt that she always faked of having friends or lovers as she uses a ton of alternate accounts where she plays an IRL dollhouse where she is a sweet girl and her friends love her.\nWe discovered though that half of the email she uses as google documents for characters, even for her so called friends or lovers, all relate to her some way (using her IRL name in the account nickname or being the very person to create the document for an apparent other person who is supposed to live in another state, and when confronted around this, she denied everything yet not being able to sustain a conversation with both her account and her fake account simultaneously. Basically if one of her personas is writing, another cannot write or read at the same time. I tested it out so many times there is no actual doubt this person walks around with 5 personas she fakes to be, playing an internet fairy tale where she has friends and family.\n\nNoticing this thing yet having no clue whatsoever why someone should do such a thing, I decided to bring my own alternate account to the game and approach one of Wolf's alter egos through her server which is currently down. And thats when the shit goes down. I apologise for the bad word, however this is more than needed.\n\nAnyone who gets in our server (which one of her persona advertise in dms) gets a warning on how me and my partners are total pos and that we should be avoided to speak at all times.\nThis persona advocates to know my own relationship with the owner and claims everyone hates us and that the owner and their admins keep eyes on us constantly because no one actually trust us with anything. \nThing that, surprise surprise, is not even remotely true when confronted the admins with screenshots at hand. \nShe also claimed us to have made Wolf \"cry a hundred times\" and that \"she was her best friend\" while Wolf instead always told us they were lovers and that they had broken up and moved on in different homes. Yet apparently this persona was able to \"be here comfort her and take her phone away from her\". With a pandemic going around. Yeah. \n\nI had fights with Wolf already, and the owner is kinda upset about drama sparking out. I fear that one lil push of drama and he'll have deleted the server. So I didn't confront her and instead allowed the owner tell her to stop any eventual grudge she had with us without mentioning eventual screenshots and stuff. \nShe said she would have \"acted civil\" so I thanked the owner and went on my way. \n\nA couple of days later I decided to understand Wolf's concept of civilization.\nBecause spoiler alert, I found it pretty paleolitic to my tastes.\n\nBy approaching another of her accounts, this time the one she should use as her personal one, I managed to get to a similar conversation about how her own server died. And guess what, she blamed us for that. And even had the guts to deny any of her involvement with the \"friends\", she hated as well quite deeply and kicked out herself. She made up a lot of facts that weren't remotely true about the server such as reaching 100 members or having fought for issues that never happened in the first place just to inflate how bad we were and how victim she was as she \"wanted no one upset\" and so she \"enforced our behaviour\". \n\nAnd the best is yet to come as she stated she still hates me for having denied her of creating a combat system in our server (which at the end of the day it is the same we have anyway just written as a textbook definition and that she tried to force on our server again recently, stopped again, by me)  which I apologised later on as I was indeed harsh with her, but I felt she wasn't listening to me at all and just spamming the same message over message. The day I sent her the apology letter she told me she had forgiven me, but ultimately, she just told my alternate otherwise, stating that my apologies were fake and I just wanted her as an asset to the roleplay server. Yet in the server, she'll tell me she wants to speak more with me. So she's still at it, and she hopes the server we are currently in will literally die or we leave, defining it a \"dying server anyway\", proceeding to inflate the lie that an absurd number of people complained and felt like not rping in out server due to us. Which again. Never happened as we always have been around 20 members. She also stated she tried to get us banned too, but she failed as I spoke to the owner recently, but she will still look to tell him all the stuff she can about us.\n\nSo people, that's the story of another mentor who I respected that crumbles down in the mud like a bag of potatoes. \nI admit my past errors, and I surely have been excessively harsh that day. There's no excuse about it.\nYet we have been friends for more than a day, I tried to make up for it and she accepted my apologies. She shouldn't have accepted them if she felt so, and I would have preferred that rather than her lying in the shadows and trying to sabotage a perfectly functional server, to probably fuel hers, as she announced a reboot of her own server. Thats a no brainer she would like to recruit people from ours and can't wait to see it kick the bucket.\nI would like to have your opinion on this fellow players. Perhaps give us advice in case you have any. Sorry for the long text. Unfortunately as a member I cannot ban her and I would rather expose this stuff to the public of our server. \n\nAs for you Wolf, in case you are reading. You lost all my respect and beyond. If it was about me, I would have already got you and your merry band of alternate puppets out. Our \"dying server\" doesn't need you as we were doing perfectly fine already without you. Have fun and a good life, but please get the hell out of mine.",

            "selftext": "This happened to me about two months ago and I still sometimes sigh about it.\n\n**The background**: A person approached me, let's call them T, because they'd seen my want ad and liked a pairing I had. It was a loose slice of life idea that followed a character who was a soldier who deserted several years prior. T proposed the idea that they'd play a FBI agent tasked with hunting down my character since the military had BS'd the reason that my character deserted. Before I agreed, I gave their request thread a quick look to see if we'd vibe. T put in theirs' that they did third person, present tense. I asked if they were able to do third person, past tense. I can roll with present, but third is easier for me to read since I exclusively write in third. T said yes and we got to plotting.\n\n**The setup**: We agreed on a sleepy little town type setting and T's character had just moved in because he'd gotten a lead on my character. It sounded pretty great and I asked the age old question of \"Who writes the starter?\" I offered to write it, but explained that it would be a day or two since I had a few real life things to handle. T had no problem with writing it, and that's what we agreed on.\n\n**Writing all by myself**: The post was *entirely* in present tense. Not a deal breaker and not enough of an issue to bring up, but I just sighed a bit. What *was* the issue, was that there was absolutely no place for me to insert my character. T had ended their post with their character hiding in the back bedroom of his house from the neighborhood welcoming committee, and had set off his car's alarm to scare off the kids. After thinking on it for a bit, I asked T if they could edit their post so I could insert my character, or have him in the same general area. To make it easier, I offered a few potential locations where the characters could cross paths. T agreed and edited their post.\n\n**Slightly different song, same damn dance**: T changed things up to a store, which worked perfectly. Except T's character continued to hide and avoid mine. Eventually, he attracted attention to himself by having a small seizure and knocking over a bunch of cans on a shelf. My character, *mentally*, wondered if the guy was sick with the flu because of how pale he was before going out to load his groceries into his truck.\n\n**Wave that red flag, my dude**: Despite neither character being telepathic in any sense of the word, my character's mental comment about T's character's health was hotly rebutted in the next post and prompted a short mental rant by the character. He also somehow knew my character's name, even though the characters hadn't talked. Slight pet peeve of mine, but I also know it can be hard to constantly refer to a character in vagueities. Still, by this point, I was getting fed up, because no matter what I did, T's character was being written to purposely avoid mine. Finally, I parked my character outside, by his truck, playing with the dog he had in the back end. Surely, that would garner some sort of interaction. Right? *Right?*\n\n**The (not so) grand finale**: My character got a whole *sentence* of acknowledgement that amounted to 'huh. He looks familiar' out of a five paragraph post. T's character then went home and promptly took a nap.  At this point, I'd completely given up and PM'd T to say that I was dropping the RP. Surprisingly, I got a simple \"okay\" in response.\n\nI don't mind the main characters being written separately, it can be a lot of fun if done right. It just needs something for each writer to work with, and that just wasn't happening here. Then again, I doubt any roleplay is going to work when one character just constantly fucks off at the slightest hint of interaction.",

            "selftext": "I never realized this subreddit existed, else I'd have been posting here sooner. I've been doing online, text-based RP for about two years now and it's transitioned into a full-on interest in writing. However, since the beginning, I've been plagued by several issues. **I'm not a writer**, not yet. I'm not good at narration and I word things very, very strangely.\n\nI do a **LOT** of ERP and I never know how to describe the actions in an interesting way. It's always \"Becky does this\" or \"Becky does that\". I don't know how much detail I'm supposed to be adding into scenes and I don't know how to word that detail. \n\nAnd there are \"idle moments\" as I like to call them. Those moments where characters are standing around (or sitting still) and conversing about stuff. I don't know how but some people manage to multi-para these moments and I can't really do that. I can't leave more than one or two lines.\n\nTL;DR My writing is really lacking. How do I improve my writing specifically for RP?",

            "selftext": "Rant Central, everybody. Let's go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is less of a singular experience but more a trend I have seen for years across the board. To preface, I know I was guilty of some of these elements in my early-mid adolescence, but to date I do find it grating in every sense of the word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love reading characters and seeing growth arcs. Yes, trauma can contribute to growth, but *please* stop laying it on thicker than fondant on a show cake. And it isn't the *content* of the trauma that repeatedly irks me, it's the character's responses and development thereafter being completely and utterly unbelievable. Though I can understand to a degree that fiction differs from reality but completely unrealistic portrayal, *belittles* the trauma itself, which from a psychiatric perspective can be very damaging to potential trauma survivors and is a jarring, misleading depiction to anyone else. (I say that as a professional who works in the Psychiatric Field, not just off the rock of my head.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlongside the infamous, thicker than molasses traumatic history, we have the utilisation of it as a personality trait. Again, *w h y*? Trauma does not define a person, therefore logistically, it cannot define a character. Easy as pie, actually. If you can take your character, strip away the trauma and have to go- *hmm, there's not much to say anymore*\\- you've not created a believable character, you've attempted to compensate for the lack of dimension by dropping the entire jar of tragedy seasoning into the mix. Even traumatised people have a personality unaffiliated to their hardships, because they are just that; **human**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately it boils down to this. Trauma can be used effectively when it is a *deviation* from the norm, because a character/person has to adapt and overcome accordingly. When *everything* is traumatic, you've got a psyche that would likely require help and support with a healing process, *not* a Machiavellian, Perfect Protagonist Superstar or a *Gritty* Hero/ine. If you are struggling to write trauma authentically research, *please*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nHappy Writing.",

            "selftext": "Okay so this story is about two years old, I feel like enough time has past that I can post it without anyone knowing who I'm talking about.   \n\n\nMy server had this one player who we'll call M.   \n\n\nM is probably the poster child for a Cross-Player, and she's honestly THE reason for my server's policy of not allowing in self-insert characters. She made a self-insert, in as much as you can in a magical universe storyline.  \n\n\nM had a thing with one eye that made it completely covered in cataracts, so she made her character have heterochromia, and I shit you not - literally twice per paragraph, she would include something about \"bi-colored eyes.\"  \n\n\nShe was also always the FIRST person in my DMs when we got a new female character that looked like they MIGHT be heterosexual and therefore competition for her characters. She would constantly be talking shit about writers who \"only wanted to write romance or smut\" because she knew that in our server, we didn't and don't count romantic arcs as genuine plot. We consider that to be Slice of Life play, and our server is aimed toward political inequality within the mage society.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, during her 6 months stay with us in the server, her character had ties to no less than 6 male PCs. Each one of them, she would be in their DMs talking about this grand romance, and casually would not mention that her character was technically already dating someone. We have a rule about lying to players specifically to block non-consensual love triangles from happening. Like, if all three writers agree, go ahead, but don't lie to one person saying \"our characters are totally going to end up together\" just to set your character up as this ultra-desirable person with two other characters competing for her affection without their writers knowing and agreeing to that competition.   \n\n\nBasically, she had a new guy every month.   \n\n\n Our server also has a Gossip Blog mechanic. It's canon that the Gossip Blog's content is anywhere from 2% to 20% fact and the rest is bullshit. M's character was featured in it ONCE. My character got dragged in almost every post for context. M's only got mentioned once, noting that she had been spotted flirting with and touching on at least 3 guys in under a week. And that was actually true.   \n\n\n She threw the biggest fit. To date, that is the only blog that's ever had to be redacted. In under a day though, her character was dragging mine and two others for the same thing. Then in the OOC chat, she was talking endless shit about another new player's character.   \nI messaged her to be mindful of her tone, and she immediately comes out with the \"I have BPD, and you're making me cry.\"   \n\n\nVerbatim, I said:  \n\"Hey \\[M\\],  \n  I've gotten a formal complaint regarding you saying \"\\[Other Female Character\\] is such a slut. I cannot wait for her to die of the clap.\" about someone else's character. I want to assume that you're joking, but this isn't the way we speak to each other in the server. I need you to be more mindful of your words and your tone going forward.\"  \n\n\nShe jumped into the DMs of a different staff member to tell them I was jealous of her character who was getting close to my character's boyfriend, and I was taking things out on her. That I should be more professional in how I speak to players because she has Bipolar Disorder and it's not okay how I came at her.   \n\n\nThing is, my staff and I keep people's mental health at the front of all our interactions because we know that most role players have some sort of mental health disorder and the last thing we ever want to do is compromise their health or at all trigger them. Even if we didn't though, it just always felt like she was playing the BPD card whenever she got in trouble, so she could be a victim and avoid being in actual trouble.   \n\n\nM did this A LOT. My server has a 3 strike policy. On your third strike, you're removed and banned from the server for 6 months. We only \"perma-ban\" when someone's shown they have nothing but bad intentions - people who raid, people who harass, people who spam our players with toxicity. We rarely permanently ban people. Also, if you get a strike and then three months go by, that strike dissolves.   \n\n\nIn the half a year she was with us, she accumulated **13 strikes** and managed to cry her way out of any actions being taken, simply by threating suicide each time.   \n\n\nUltimately, the reason we permanently banned her was because at the end, she wound up with only one male writer who was willing to ship with her character. This guy was really inactive and all he ever wanted to write was smut. Usually, we would have kicked him a long time ago because he'd been there for a year and not pushed even the smallest bit of plot, but he was a friend and he had been paralyzed from the waist down, so giving him a place to write was the least I could do.   \n\n\nSo, the \"new girl\", the one M had said played a character she hoped would die of the clap? We'll call the new girl S. S did a scene with M's character's love interest (my friend who had been paralyzed). They weren't in a relationship though, and M had already more than shown she had no loyalties toward him. S and Love Interest got into the scene. They were flirting a little, but nothing too crazy happened.   \n\n\nLove Interest's writer messaged me about a week into writing that scene with screen shots of M telling him that if Love Interest and S's character got together, M's character would kill S's character and M would find and kill S. As far as I'm concerned, that's harassment. She wasn't just harassing her writing partner, she was issuing actual threats; and S had already issued two formal complaints about how M was acting towards her out of character.  \n\n\nI want to respect people's trauma, but I'm not here for mental health being a scapegoat excuse for being toxic to other people. M, by then, had made it very, very clear that she felt like ONLY her mental health mattered and she was the only person with a disorder on the internet.   \n\n\nSo, I messaged her and told her that this was her 13th strike, we had given her more chances than we've given anyone in the server to date and we're not going to do that anymore. We had proof that she was harassing multiple players, and at that point, we'd only really allowed her to stay as a favour to my friend, who had just expressed that he was deeply unsettled by her. So she was banned \"effective immediately\" and then blocked.   \n\n\nAnd like any sane person, she immediately messaged S because they were in another server together, to tell her to \"eat shit and die like the whore she is.\" Great gal, that M.   \n\n\n\\--  \nOh, and, another super fun thing M did.   \nAt one point, she was crying in the OOC chat every day about how she could see the guys that her character had been into moving on and that it wasn't fair to her because she didn't have internet access at the time and couldn't play from her phone. I was in a position where I could help, and contrary to popular believe, I like helping people, especially my players.   \nSo, I offered to pay for her internet bill that month as well as the late fees from the last two. This girl first kept changing the amount of money she actually needed. First it was 118, then 200 even, then 350. I had the money and she seemed like she was in a really dark place, so I talked it over with my husband and I agreed to pay the full 350. Then she tried to get me to send them money via Western Union to her, as cash, instead of directly to the internet company. I refused, because that felt really sketchy. She kept fighting me on it, eventually I got the account information from her and paid the total, which was about $178 and some change. I made sure none of my information was saved, so I couldn't be hit with some bs autopay, and she assured me that her boyfriend was getting his first paycheque in a week, so he'd be able to cover it from then on.   \nHer internet was back later that day, and she was soooo very nice for about an hour as she started writing again. After an hour, she got upset because my male character wasn't interested in her character, and she got really mean, really fast in my DMs, talking about what an asshole I am because my male character wasn't immediately simping for hers just for showing a little bit of titty. I had already been dealing with her shit all day, so I just ended the scene and figured I didn't need to write much with her on that character anymore since they clearly didn't mesh well.   \n\n\nFast forward to a month later, M's in my DMs again because her internet's been disconnected and it's my fault. How is it my fault? Oh, because she had attempted to connect my card to her account and the charge got declined. She thought I should have warned her that she can't just connect my bank to her internet provider for autopay. This girl straight up told me that if she gets kicked for inactivity, I have only myself to blame.   \n\n\nAmazingly, that was also the month that S arrived and S was actual competition for her because they both played very sexual characters, so all the guys that had previously liked M's character, worshipped S's character. And wouldn't you guess it - somehow M found the funds to pay her internet bill so she could start writing more actively again and defend her little smut throne.   \n\n\n\\--  \nYeah, a lot of this was me coddling her, for sure. I mean, 13 strikes. Holy shit. I learned a very valuable lesson with her, which is that it's one thing to be gentle and compassionate with players I know are struggling with their mental health, and it's another thing entirely to allow someone to weaponize their mental health as a perpetual get-out-of-jail-free card. Sociopaths and Narcissists also have mental health disorders, that doesn't mean they are entitled to special treatment.   \n\n\nSo yeah, there's my lesson, learned the hard so you all don't have to.",

Anyway, I'll give some background info first of all. (Sorry for any grammar mistakes.)\n\nI've joined an IRL friend's server recently, and it's been pretty decent. There are around eight other members, all around the 14-17 range so yes, young roleplayers. My friend who's the mod of the server (we shall refer to her as 'Alex') decided to convert it into a small roleplay server around a few days ago. Naturally, I was thrilled. I didn't know she was into roleplay and I could finally get the chance to introduce my friend to it! We'll call this other friend J.\n\nAnyway! We submitted our characters and it was all going smoothly. I was so glad J had picked up roleplaying relatively fast, and she wrote amazing responses consisting of lengthy paragraphs to fit mine. Most of the others in the server ranged from one-liners to a couple sentences, and I was alright with that! I could shorten my responses for them, but seeing as I was roleplaying with J at the moment, I didn't need to do that just yet. \n\nWell, apparently not.\n\nAlex completely interrupted our roleplay, asking for us to type shorter responses to each other. Correct me if I'm wrong, but was there a problem? J and I were roleplaying privately at the moment and not with Alex, who normally stuck to one-liners, so I thought it was fine. Anyway, J and I ignored this and continued our pace.\n\nAnd Alex completely butts in this time, not OOC, but with her OC. Don't get me wrong, I would of been fine with her joining, as long as she asked. She sort of changed our whole peaceful plot to a battle scene. Again, a bit of a surprise, but I went with it and so did J. After that shit show, she immediately started flirting and trying to get with J's character. Again, fine if she had not READ our long-term plans on getting both our characters together and guiding them on sort of a healing journey together. Alex even approved this pairing. So I was like...excuse me?? Twas' quite irritating she totally treated all my characters like shit and ignored them, only focusing on J's character. I could tell J was uncomfortable. Her responses became less enthusiastic and she eventually DM'd me expressing this, then asking if she could roleplay with another character with Alex to keep her busy while we focused on our main roleplay. I never mind when someone participates in multiple roleplays so of course, I said it was fine.\n\nBut now J can hardly reply to our roleplay because of Alex. When Alex sends her response she doesn't even wait a few minutes before immediately pinging and spamming J in DM's, telling her to reply and that her roleplay was more important. Wow??? The worst thing is, J expressed her discomfort but couldn't say she wanted to end the roleplay, otherwise she'd wind up getting kicked from the server altogether. (Yes, this had happened before with a previous member. Petty, right?)\n\nI understand if you don't know basic roleplay etiquette. I will be willing to guide you if you let me. However, Alex wasn't having it. I even suggested writing some basic roleplay rules and advice for everyone. A subtle jab, i know, but I was desperate at this point.\n\nALSO SHE KEPT CONTROLLING OUR CHARACTER ACTIONS WTF IS UP WITH THAT?! THAT'S LIKE, THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO??????\n\nShe also provided unsolicited criticism on peoples replies. Criticism is totally acceptable as long as you ask first, in my opinion. And obviously, as long as it's not in the middle of a damn roleplay! ALso, she said it in the shittiest way? Alex was even incorrect about most of her 'points' she made towards my friends about grammar, so I'm just-\n\nI'm just gonna go drink a random elixir a dragon dropped at level 20 after I'd slain it because I'm ready to risk it all at this point.  I'm gonna confront her, whoopdeedoo. Here goes nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnywayyy, sorry for that poorly-crafted spiel. It was small things to whine about, but idk just dawfygvayuhvghvgvhghg.",

Not only did tons more people leave due to his attacks on anyone not kissing his rear but it got to the point someone crashed the site with bots in retaliation of his abuse.\n\nSites kinda fixed now but admins are getting worse\nSo the sites OOC chat is hid away and if you do find it you have to be approved to enter it. Its also considered a no mans land and even in then sites TOS its is \u201cuse at your own risk\u201d basically get a tougher skin and dont complain if someone breaks the rules. As if the admins didnt really uphold the rules as it is now practically encouraged not to do the job they were given.\n\nAnyways the new admin will just call her agent x\nHad a new player pm her to ask to be let in\n\nIt went like this\n\nNew guy \u201cmay i please be allowed into OOC?\u201d\n\nX \u201c only if you ask nicely \u201c\n\nNew guy \u201c i did? I said please i thaught that was nice.\u201d\n\nX \u201c not where im from\u201d\n\nIt basically devolved from there and the person got kicked for being \u201csnippy\u201d\n\nBut it gets better\nThe other admin agent K the one who i used to live with but kicked me out of the house over rp drama  chimed in and gave a warning.
