            "selftext": "I see a lot of complaints on here about ghosting and partners dropping off, and I'm just here to spread the message that it is A-OK to communicate when you are no longer interested in an RP. In fact often the lack of muse goes both ways! I'm also going to tell you how I handle it when this happens.\n\n**New RPs**\n\nI usually give people about a week of radio silence for a new RP, meaning one without very many posts or with someone I don't know well yet. Then I reach out and tell them: hey it's perfectly okay if you lost muse, I will absolutely never get mad at people for dipping, you don't owe me an explanation and I'm not going to go off on you. 90% of the time I get a 'hey yeah I was afraid to say anything' and both of us go on our ways. If I like them I let them know it's OK to reach out to me later if they decide they want to pick up something else. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.\n\n**Old RPs**\n\nIf someone I know really well and like hasn't responded to our RP in a month or two, I usually reach out and give them a similar message, except in that case it's 'it's A-OK if you lost your muse, you don't HAVE to RP with me in order for me to be friends with you'. Sometimes they did lose muse, sometimes they're just hitting a rough patch. Either way I keep a friend, neither of us gets resentful, and we're all clear on where we stand on the RP.\n\n**So you just got ghosted**\n\nThat sucks. It's valid to be upset when someone dips for no reason and no communication. Personally I try not to take these to heart. Most of the time, it was them and not you, and I always tell myself that I wasn't compatible with someone who lacks that much communication skill to begin with.

            "selftext": "I'm sorry, but I just needed to vent a little about the current state of RPing.\n\nIt's tiring putting a little bit of yourself into every RP, then seeing them topple like a Jenga tower one way or another, just because some small issue ends up escalating and completely destroying everything you've built. And that's if you can even get that tower built. Ghosting might be bad, but at least you don't have to build up an OC with great detail and care just to realise that half the tower was never there in the first place.\n\nIs it possible to just get a small RP community going from this subreddit? Honestly, the comments here have been some of the most logical and reasonable I've seen among the whole RP community. It's a paragon of common-sense and basic etiquette. Outside of this subreddit, trying to get an RP going is like entering a jungle, knowing that there are snakes and tigers out there, but trying to find that one animal that won't eat you up or just lead you astray.\n\nMaybe I just need a better BS-detection system, or I just need to be a little more firm in my ad postings. Can anyone recommend their checkpoints for a list that can filter out the classic examples of r/badrperstories?\n\nI swear the broader RPing community wasn't this toxic or ambivalent about RPing a few years ago. I'm not sure if it's covid getting everyone down, or if all the good RP partners have already paired up, but after ending a few bittersweet long-term RPs, trying to find partners to create something just as long lasting has been a complete nightmare. \n\nI'm mentally and emotionally exhausted from partner searching, so I'll probably be letting my RP chops take a longer rest than I had expected, so that I can come back with a more positive outlook on one of my favourite hobbies.\n\nI hope everyone else has good luck with finding partners. It's sure as hell frustrating, but I know the joy of finding someone who is relaxed enough to vibe on the same wavelength as you as you both write to your heart's content can be an amazing feeling. It's just frustratingly not been happening for me recently. \n\nJust to end things on a slightly more positive note and to shy away from the doom and gloom that's been pervading this post, here's a beautiful quote from Mitch Albom that was shared with me at the end of one of the aforementioned bittersweet conclusions to the RPs:\n\n\"*Every ending is a beginning. We just don't know it at the time*.\"",

I know I shouldn't have let the baby cook dinner!\"\n\nIts an acceptance of what the last person said, while adding something for them to work with. Arin talked about something he would NEVER do in improv but he found the idea funny, which was called \"yes period.\"\n\nThe example he gave.\n\n\"Wow, these biscuits are too big for my arms!\"\n\n\"Yes, those biscuits ARE too big for your arms!\"\n\nIt accepts the idea, but gives no new information so the first person has to pull teeth to keep the scene going.\n\n**I hate this in RP so fucking much.**\n\nSo I try to plot with someone, and THIS is our exchange.\n\nMe: \\_\\_\\_\\_ do you want to do something? &lt;3\n\nThem: Sure :D\n\nMe: Cool!

Do you want them to have met before or this be their first meeting? im down to plot if youd like &lt;3\n\nThem: I don't mind either\n\nMe: maybe they met when (information)?\n\nThem: Sure lmfao That may actually work \n\nMe: cuz she would know what its like to be the new kid so she would try to help him out? :)\n\nThem: yes :D\n\nMe: Cool! So do you think they'd be friends?\n\n*Literally they gave me nothing and made me come up with everything.*\n\nThis happens often and it drives me up a wall.

            "selftext": "and make it double!\n\nToday, I want to write about something I have encountered many times in group roleplays: people who bring their friends. This is not a problem in itself, in fact, sometimes it is cool when people bring their friends. But some are...not that great. Do you have another type to add?\n\n**joining a group roleplay and ONLY writing with the one person you already know:**\n\nThis is not really a problem when there are many characters and all are of equal importance. \n\nBut some people I encountered would apply for one of the most important roles, a role were they have to interact with multiple other characters and do a lot for the progression of the plot, at least normally (for example a queen or the leader of a criminal organisation). And then, they only interact with the partner they came with, give them all the spotlight, and basically make a 1x1 roleplay while many other writers are waiting for them to do anything that is important for the plot. \n\nIf you apply for a leading role in a group roleplay that is centered around the conflict of different groups, you can't just be like 'Eh, guess my character will spend all their time with their beautiful wife and never do anything relating to the actual plot of the roleplay.'\n\n**Inviting your favourite writing partner although they are a huge bully:**\n\nYou know the wonderful situation when the writers in a group roleplay get along great, and there is not much conflict or no conflict at all? This occurance is rather rare, but it does happen. But then, someone says 'Hey, I have a friend, can they join?'\n\nAt first, you agree and are even interested in what kind of person this might be and what characters they have in mind. I mean, this nice person would never bring someone who is rude and toxic, right? \n\nWrong. The first thing they tell the group is something like '(Core idea of the roleplay) is rather boring, but maybe I can make it work.' They act like they are a savior who will finally bring some kind of excitement into a roleplay that is otherwise boring and bland.\n\n At first, you think to yourself 'well, they are probably an alright guy, or (friend) would not have invited them. Maybe they are just a bit inexperienced when it comes to interacting with people.' So, you try to be nice, ask them about their characters, and give them the benefit of the doubt. But it does not work out, at all. It only gets worse.\n\n Maybe they choose one of the other writer's character profiles to point how ridiculous this character is, while acting like the whole character concept is an insult to the art of roleplaying. \n\nOr they create a character that basically does not fit the plot at all (for example a vampire that is super elitist and a count in the human world, when the description of the roleplay states that vampires have to hide in the shadows if they don't want to be killed). If you tell them that this does not quite fit the lore, they shrug and say 'I did not read the summary.'\n\nOr they constantly start fights ooc, about basically everything, mocking and insulting people for things like talking about a movie they like and the bad roleplayer dislikes.\n\nOr they create a character that is so overpowered that it hurts, and when the mod tells them to change their powers a little, they throw a huge fit and insult them. Maybe they even do all of the above.\n\nAll this time, they friend stays quiet, never saying anything in their defence, but also not calling them out on their behavior, ever. Soon, the atmosphere in the group turns sour. Finally, the bad roleplayer leaves (or is kicked out). If you ever talk about the friend who invited them about them, this friend will say something like 'Yeah, they can be quite difficult, I know. They do not really get along well with groups.' and shrug.\n\nIf you have known this all this time, why did you not warn us before, why did you even invite them?\n\n**The takeover:**\n\nThe group roleplay has barely started, and suddenly, a large group of friends (maybe four or six) applies. Great! More fun characters to interact with.\n\nWell, no. After everyone created their character profiles and starts roleplaying, you notice something. These people only interact with each other, and they also want to change the rules and the structure of the roleplay to fit their own needs and wants, and only theirs.\n\n Because they are so many people, and often threaten to quit all together if something goes wrong, the mods feel like they can't do much if they don't want to loose half of their writers and sometimes try to compromise.\n\n Big mistake. After a month, they all leave regardless, often insulting the roleplay and moving on to another one (sometimes even creating a copy of the roleplay they just left for themselves). The other writers often have lost their interest in the roleplay at this point, because so much of the original concept was already changed to fit these people's demands. \n\n**The passive and the aggressive one:**\n\nor, 'the power of friendship'. These people will join almost every group roleplay together. While one of them is nice and kind, (and often able to become roleplaying friends with multiple people in the group), the other one is not. \n\nThe aggressive one will always pick a fight or whine about something. They are often more manipulative then the bully which I mentioned before. So they try to paint other members they don't agree with in a bad light and see themself as the victim of bullying, and it is often harder to figure out who is right or wrong. But then the same situation happens again. And again. And again, even with the kindest people in the whole group, and you get the feeling the aggressive guy is not really as nice as they claim to be.\n\nThe passive person is always by their side, defending them against the 'bullies'. Their opinion never differs, because that would mean that the passive one does not defend their best friend in the hardest of times. \n\nSoon, you have enough of this, so you don't contact the passive one as much as you used to and avoid them. Finally, the aggressive one does something that is the last straw and which gets them kicked out of the roleplay (for example literally threatening people with violence, saying they want to bash the mods head in or someone should commit suicide, and so on).\n\nThe passive one will not, even in this situation disagree with them. Instead, they will talk about the power of friendship, and real friends will ALWAYS support each other, even in super hard times! Nevermind that their friend just threatened someone they also were friendly with with violence.",

I sent a message, and it seemed that we clicked in reddit DMs, so we moved it to discord. One of his rules that he mentioned was that if I was going to be gone, even if just for 5 minutes or 5 days, I've got to let him know. I was like... okay? I do that anyway, so it wasn't a big deal for me.   \nAgain, we got along, we had similar tastes, we wrote similar amounts and in a similar style. It was going great!  \nI said brb when I needed to go, he said ok, and when i came back an hour later, he was still online but no response. No worries, some people only reply when both people are online. So, I sent a message to say I'm back and we could continue if he wanted. No reply.   \nI didn't press again, until about 5 hours later when I let him know I was going to bed so was going to be offline, not sure if he was caught up in something, so wanted to make sure when he was back he knew I was gone.   \nWhen I came back the next day, nothing. No worries, again, might have been asleep or busy. I did think it was a bit hypocritical that he all but *demanded* that I tell him when I was going to be gone, and then disappears without a word, but whatever. The rp was fun and going well and I wasn't gonna start an argument over nothing.   \nThen **poof**. Danny muthefucking Phantom up in here ghosts. Kicks me from the server, unfriends and blocks me on discord. So, I sent a message to the reddit, just saying \"yo, just wanna say you didn't have to ghost, I could take it if you weren't enjoying it, just wanna wish you best of luck in your search tho!\", just something quick and polite for my own closure. Again, no response, but what did I expect, eh?  \n\n\nJust felt like I needed to get this off my chest, since it's super weird that he demanded that I tell him whenever i'mma disappear for even 5 mins, but then ghosts and its kind of a dick move, but oh well.

            "selftext": "I guess I am hopping on the same train that a couple of other people who have recently posted are on to announce that it is fucking difficult to find people that you vibe with. People that match your level of excitement, creativity, likes and dislikes, that understand what you're going for because that's what they want as well. I don't know what's going on but as of lately, I've felt completely off-sync with the individuals that have reached out to my ads. I don't know if it's me and I am not properly conveying what I want in my ads or if people aren't reading them through and just responding, but it's like we'll begin to plot and something just feels so horribly....off. \n\nI will provide a perfect example. Someone had reached out to an ad of mine voicing their interest in a plot I had listed, okay cool, great. Wonderful. The plot in question revolves around the two main characters, i.e my character and their own, being best friends and essentially globe trotting together. I had made it clear that my character has a difficult time keeping let alone maintaining friends, so the fact that this character was their best friend is pretty significant. This person wanted to begin writing basically as soon as we connected via discord, which disturbed me if only because like, nothing had been established yet. How the characters knew each other/when they met/how they began working together, nothing. Of course, I had asked them to hold their horses and to plot with me a little, if only so I could form a connection ic to this character that again, was meant to be their best friend. My partner had formulated a whole ass plot of how the two had met, I am talking a fairly detailed head cannon. The only problem is that I didn't even have time to consider it or ask any questions, or even interject where I saw fit seeing as I couldn't exactly see my character meeting this person this way, let alone becoming close to them, because they had already posted a starter. Now I don't feel connected to the story at all because I don't feel as if my character has any connection to their own, not in the way that I had envisioned it for the plot. \n\nWith other people, the plotting goes great, and you appear to be on the same wavelength until the writing actually starts and something is again, just....off. I don't know how to describe it, it just feels like holding an empty husk in your hands that you're supposed to make something of and respond to when there is no substance there to actually reply to. \n\nThen there are the overplanners that want to plot everything down to what kind of coffee they'll be having during the first interaction and being unable to start until they find the perfect middle name for their character and at that point, what is the fucking point of writing anything since you've already basically completed the roleplay through a series of drawn-out headcannoning. I don't know. I don't know if this makes any sense, but I am growing increasingly tired of this game of matching. I love collaborative writing, I absolutely adore bringing a story to life with someone else, but does anyone else honestly feel like at this point their efforts would better be spent writing a novel? At least there, you only have yourself to blame when something is off. With that being said, I also fully acknowledge that this could all just be on me, but I find that hard to believe as I am relatively low maintenance and I don't ask the world of my partners. I guess I just don't know how much plotting is enough plotting for me at this point.",

WHERE DO PEOPLE GET OFF reaching out to someone, who clearly has plots that they wish to do on their wanted ad, and give ideas completely un-fucking-related to the ones that you posted/wish to do, or like morphings of your own ideas to fit their narrative/what they wish to do. \n\nI understand that with collaborative writing, you have to work together to find the plot that works best for you. I completely get that. But working together to establish dynamics isn't the same as completely tossing out EVERYTHING in order to lay out your own blueprints of what you want to do. I recently had two fucking people reach out to me about a toxic mxf plot that I wanted to do; one of them just blatantly said that they have a f character that they wish to play that they could \"alter to fit the plot\", when I already made it clear that I want to play f. When I didn't respond, because I wasn't sure how to go about it without being a dick just yet, they go \"hey u didn't respond but I'm going to send u this character anyway\". \n\nAnother person responded to the same prompt and basically said \"hey mxf bores me to death but I am willing to do mxm with female side characters and I can play m characters for your f character to sleep with.\" What the fuck? Like, no, first of all I don't want random ass male characters for my f character to fuck, I want a ***toxic relationship plot*** in which I wish to play the female character, because I rarely get to play female characters these days seeing as apparently most people just want to be virtually seduced via roleplay/play the female role. It's just so fucking rude and disrespectful bro, like if someone has made it clear in their wanted ad what character they wish to play and what they want the dynamic to be, DO NOT roll in and bulldoze over their wishes just so you can get what you want. Make your own wanted ad at that point. And again, I understand that in roleplaying you have to work together to ascertain what works best for each party, but that isn't what was going on here. I just had to get that off my chest because I am beyond irritated and I'm ready to just tap out.",

Who wants to be in what role? Any topics you don't want me to touch? What canon point are we drawing these guys from? Did you have any ideas since you posted the top post on what kind of scenario you are actually looking for/expecting?\n\nNot only should that not take three freaking days to figure out, but I wouldn't have to ask at all if any of these things were stated in top post. To me, these questions are to avoid awkwardness and potential ghosting later. And I don't read minds. It's frustrating because I'm an older rper and I miss the days when people actually communicated. I don't know what has happened in rp to where people can't even respond to basic plotting/setting up without it taking days to actually begin.\n\nIt's probably my cue to cut my losses in that thread or go in with extremely low expectations. It's just so demoralizing. I don't expect everyone to be rapid fire, but come on. How is anything supposed to ever actually get written?

We got on discord and we decided to go over refs first. They said they would share theirs then I would share mine.\n\nAfter they shared their refs they asked for mine so I said ok let me get a link for them. When I went back to share the link the person had apparently blocked me. I'm not quite sure why it was out of the blue and right at the start of setting it up. Anyone got a idea why because I'm just confused on why. I got curious and sent a message on reddit \"Hi why did you block me? If you dont want to rp with me that's fine I'm just curious.\" I know that's abit creepy but I just couldn't think of a reason to why they did.",

            "selftext": "In every rp, there's this one oc that's precious, pure, and innocent. They usually serve as the moral compass in good vs. bad, break the cutie trope in horror, or the \u201cheart\u201d in groups. Character types the most likely use is children, amnesiac, and/or 13-20-year-old characters.\n\n\nThis type of character is great for casual and detailed plot lines because you get to see their character develop as the storyline progresses. However, there\u2019s many downsides to playing [with] a character in that archetype without proper care. One of them is that they\u2019re overly dependent on other characters for their own development. \n\nFor example, Sam makes a character but in order for their character to shine/be useful they need to go with a specific type of character to enhance their characters qualities. Sam\u2019s character is nice and innocent so they want to go with a character who is mean and cruel to \u201cchange their ways\u201d. The sad truth is that who you rp with might not continue to rp with you so you have to design a character that will still function normally without much change done to them if their partner(s) leave. What ends up happening is that Sam\u2019s character is completely fucked. Their whole story arc revolved around one character and that fell apart the moment they left. So now they can\u2019t do anything or they have to restart with another person. \n\nPure characters tend to have linear thoughts, 1D personalities, limited information on *lots* of things which make it difficult to come up with starters or responses. They have too many good qualities about them that the only flaw they have is a lack of knowledge of things. Actually I would argue that their good qualities make them a liability for others.\n\nIn fights where you need to take down a monster, they would be the last person you go to for strategies. They\u2019ll likely have support roles or they\u2019ll be defenseless so you\u2019ll need to protect them. Their character might not even know they\u2019re in danger if a monster comes rushing at them. Or if they\u2019re a pacifist (which is likely the case cause violence = bad to them), the fight will drag on AND now the team will be tested on their moral compass while doing it. It makes for great scenarios...but not in every single fight.\n\nIn a slice of life/school setting, they're airheads and you can't figure out how the hell they were able to get into a university or prestigious high school with knowledge comparable to a 5th grader. Even if they do they ditzy but smart thing it just seems so...unrealistic and confusing. One minute they don't know how a girl gets pregnant but gets an A+ on a surprise sexED quiz..\n\nIn a horror rp, that is *if* you can find them being in that type of rp. Most people who play pure characters avoid horror rps like the plague because they\u2019re characters are innocent by nature, unfamiliar with bad and that can be easily taken advantage of. They trust everyone they meet and often can\u2019t \u201cread the room\u201d or know that some places and people are red flags. Horror rps most of the time don't use PTK so this leads to a fast death. For their archetype to even work, they need to be alive so they'll try to cling to other characters for safety and would gladly use them as scapegoats (masking them as their \u201csaviors\u201d) if their character is at risk of death. The people playing these characters aren't dumb, I've seen this happen and it blows up ooc. \n\nIf you have some experiences of rping as and with innocent characters I would like to hear it, I'm curious what others think about this character type. Just seems like a liability for the player and others.",
