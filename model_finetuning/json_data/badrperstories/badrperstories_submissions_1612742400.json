I'm sorry you don't want to upset them but if they were really your friends they would follow the rules instead of constantly breaking them.\n\n\u2022 Please for our sanity get most of the rules outlined before you start! Also don't get mad when someone breaks a rule thats not listed. Every server is different and people are used to different rules, don't just assume we know what you want. Going along with that don't get mad when others ask questions about rules that aren't listed. \n\n\u2022 If you know you are going to be gone for more than a few days, leave the scene especially if its with more than 3 people. If we aren't allowed to skip turns this makes it all the more frustrating. Especially if you are constantly active in VC or are rping with another character in another scene. \n\n\u2022 In general rp areas like markets, streets, bars, inn, taverns, malls, parks, etc.. Let more than one scene happen at a time OR create more than one channel for it. I don't know how many times I've been unable to start a scene because all the general rp channels were taken up by scenes and move slower than a snails pace.",

            "selftext": "So I (24F) Had an rp partner (32F) we recently broke off not just our rp but our friendship. We've known each other for a year and a half, and decided to rp 7 months ago. We planned everything out, we agreed it'd be a medieval setting where there is discrimination against magic users and a huge magic vs non magic war going on. Every time I tried to consult her on how they should be discriminated against I got \"Idk you decide\" we were already in the process of rping not yet at that part.   \n\n\nShe always left everything up to me and gave me next to nothing to work with so I had to lead the rp on constantly which didn't change even when I asked her if she could be a bit more descriptive and involved and stop leaving all the plot up to me.  \n\n\nHer responses to the RP were anywhere from 3 - 6 days apart which was fine I kept telling her \"its okay take your time\"  \nI had a major depressive episode where I needed to take a break from everything for 3 days because I couldn't even talk to someone without breaking down, I explained this to her and apologised for it. The whole time I was gone it was constant angry \"Do you even want to do this rp anymore? How selfish are you?\" which I came back to  \n\n\nShe made me apologise to her over and over again until she was satisfied when I got back, told me \"Don't be such a rude rp partner next time or no one will want to RP with you\"  \n\n\nSo I had been thinking on the RP while I was gone, took the time to plan some things because I needed to occupy myself.   \nI figured out a way to discriminate them, I thought maybe they could only have low positions in society as servants unless they let the humans bind their magic. The binding could be reversed. I put this idea into action and first had it mentioned in the RP when I got back.  \n\n\nShe confronted me angry that I \"didn't talk to her about it\" and how she \"feels like shes out of the loop and not included\" even though I fully described how it worked in the RP character to character. I apologised and explained my reasoning for it that we needed some form of discrimination because it was the whole plot. Girl changes the world and fixes the political issues along side her friends and loved ones bit by bit, fighting for the freedom of the magic community from the inside.  \n\n\nI told her she gave me nothing to work with, wasn't on enough, and refused to discuss things with me always telling me to figure it out. She calmed down and I thought that was that, she agreed to it and told me to continue with it.  \n\n\nFast forward by 3 weeks and she gets mad again when her character is put in the position of she has to allow herself to be binded (Fake binded / lie about being binded by her love interest who sympathies with magic users and wants to protect her) she said she didn't want her character bound. I explained \"She won't be, but she would have to fake it because logically they aren't going to allow a magic user to walk around just because shes the main female lead. The world is highly prejudice we established that. She just can lie about and fake being bound kind of like the tv show merlin where he hid his magic.\"  \n\n\nShe got angrier and said \"My character never lies its not part of her personality\"  \nSomething to note here, we never spoke about characters personalities in rp or ooc, its not even on the character sheets and there was no indication of anything like this at all. I said \"Okay then we'll figure something out\"  \n\n\nShe told me \"Just take the whole discrimination thing out of the rp, just have them look down on the magic users but treat them no differently. My character will become queen and make them love magic users and then she will marry (insert love interests name)\" which is fully different than what we both had originally planned together in the first place. \"You never talk to me about anything so I end up out of the loop.\" (Note this is the only rp we've ever done, we haven't had previous issues before we started it up and this is the only instance of me not talking to her about something before doing it) \"Its our rp not your rp, you're such a selfish b\\*tch. You even left for 3 days with that stupid excuse of depression. Depression isn't an excuse to abandon me and our rp\"  \n\n\nI don't know if I'm in the wrong for making the call for how the magic users were discriminated against despite her refusing to communicate, barely being around, and giving me nothing to work with, maybe I should have kept pushing her to talk to me rather than just planning it on my own. However I know shes in the wrong for her comments about my depression and how rude she was for it.",

They're nice enough, and a good writer, but they kept trying to take the roleplay in a direction I really, really, *really* didn't want it to go. At first I just tried to steer away from it in character, but when that didn't work, I decided to come clean about it OOC. I apologized and explained I wasn't comfortable with what they were trying to do, they seemed understanding about it, and we both agreed that we'd be open to writing something different in the future.\n\nAfter that, for unrelated reasons, I went on a little break. I logged back in about a week later, and the second X noticed I was back around, they were right back to hounding me about doing that one plot I thought we'd agreed we *wouldn't* do. And I'm like... did they forget our talk? Did they think *I* would forget? I don't know. But if they did think I would have forgotten all about it by now, I don't understand why they'd assume I'd come back from my break ready and eager to give them what they wanted. Especially considering the reasons I gave them for not wanting to do it, aka basically that it made me uncomfortable. Which wasn't going to go away just like that.\n\nAnyone got any similar experiences?",

I'd like to share one of the themes that kept popping up during my search.\n\nI am a sfw rper and my ads make that very clear.  For the most part, it does cut down on the riffraff.  However, I have a habit of attracting the sort person who tries to gently nudge rp in the direction of their kinks.  \n\nI play mostly fantasy stories which makes it easier for these people to initially slip through the cracks.  Do I like the idea of a Freaky Friday body-swap situation between a princess and a commoner?  Yes. Do I want to roleplay that with someone whose post history is almost entirely filled with transformation kink subs?  No.\n\nDo I like the idea of cursed items that limit my character in some way? Yes.  Do I want that to be a collar that lets the first magically-inclined person to find my character control everything they do?  No.  What if that person is an older male who will at first see her as a servant, but then fall in love with her?  Also no.  What if she then, when given the chance to get rid of it, kept the collar on as a sign of trust between them?  Again, no.\n\nWhat gets me is that I'm pretty sure these people think they are being super subtle even though they all use the exact same playbook.  And, of course, when called out on it, they will either claim that there's no actual sex so it doesn't count as nsfw or they will deny that they're doing it despite any evidence to the contrary.

The conversation ended up delving into characters and it took me...more than a hot minute to figure out their 'OC' is actually a famous, fairly strongly republican leading musician. It was a little embarrassing it took me a bit to pick up on it because in the place I grew up, spotting members of this particular band out in public is almost a public sport.\n\nObviously at that point I declined the RP, explained why (I don't like that person because of their politics and also I just find RPing as a RL person icky). They got on me about how the person 'doesn't care about politics' and 'doesn't necessarily look down on people because they're a republican'. They spent a REALLY long time trying to justify it to me, and eventually ended on how they made significant changes so it doesn't count anymore.\n\nJust...make your own OC then? Why pick an IRL person and then try to lie about the fact that your OC is actually an IRL person? I would have said no immediately and I'm glad I picked up on it before we started RPing and not after.\n\nI don't get it. Just don't lie to people. Why is this hard?",

We wrapped up our stories and now I just talk and play games with them.

I struggle to write more than 1-3 paragraphs now whereas I used to write 5+ at a time.  The other thing is frequency.  I can get maybe 1-2 posts out in the same about of days.  It's not the most active pace, but I've had lovely partners in the past who fit that criteria themselves due to busy lives and other issues.  There are bound to be other great people out there whose needs are similar.\n\nI didn't have the highest expectations, but I was optimistic.  I've gotten plenty of replies, but guys, my DMs are an elephant graveyard of Jareds, people clearly only after smut, people that would be happy to play if I either change my length or reply time, people who would like to play except they don't like fantasy which is clearly noted as the only thing I do play, and people asking me to join their groups when I'm posting 1x1 ads.\n\nI'm just tired, y'all.",

Oh here are a bunch of character with anime reference pictures and personalities that suit that medium instead of GOT. Marvel? Too bad! here's Kenshi Of The Seventy Self Inserts as apart of the Avengers and nothing distinctly Marvel about him. Just pulled straight from this season's major Isekai anime, like, I have nothing against anime as an avid watcher of it. I love the creativity of it all anime can be phenomenal and I will continue to love it until I die. But if I'm joining a RP with a very realistic vision and characters that fit that then I don't want to see an anime protagonist as one of the casts of characters. Even worse when the server has a ton of realistic PBs, but then there's this one profile with some first page pinterest anime reference, like it's so jarring and uncanny and it's even more confusing as to why it was approved. Am I alone on this? I feel like I'm going crazy.",

            "selftext": "When I was a young RP'er, I'd join a fair share of group RPs, and I almost always just had the worst of times. The writing was dry and going nowhere fast due to all the issues there'd be in regards to coordinating 4+ writers, the OOC would be cluttered and drama prone and the story being told have almost always being extraordinarily boring. If you got beyond the first hour of the narrative, you're doing well. That's depressing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I look around and about, I see this happening all over the place. Dry stories, nothing much happening, and to top it all off, most group RPs seem to die off quick. This has caused me to be rather morbidly curious about group RPs. It's to the point where I see someone advertising an ambitious group RP, and then I'll lurk it just to see how it'll go wrong, grabbing my popcorn and everything. And yet, there are people who are so impassioned about group RPs that they keep writing them, and even more morbid, they keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again. Like setting up super complicated RPs yet have no central figure akin to a GM. Or getting overly pedantic about various plot details that really, really don't matter in the grand scheme of things. Or forgetting to include various characters, having the writer of those characters just kind of sidelined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have maybe seen a few group RPs that seem successful. They still die out fast, but at least you can tell they were fun while they lasted. That in mind, I'm completely at a loss as to why group RPs even exist in the first place. Am I going mad, or are they really as bad as they seem? I'd love to hear from group RP lovers as to what makes all that hard work worth it in the end. \n\nApologies if this thread doesn't fit in to this sub, I wasn't quite sure where to put it.",

            "selftext": "...that I have no interest in writing.\n\nThis is something that I have encountered multiple times when I set my boundaries or tell people that a certain plot does not interest me (even with friendly people, people who have obviously read my search or people who I knew from group roleplays where we get along well). \n\nFor example, I am not very interested in roleplays about 'everyday life' with no fantasy. I am much more comfortable with a dramatic medieval fantasy plots, because in all the years that I have been roleplaying, I noticed that other roleplays often get boring for me. \n\nAnd of course, I don't want to tell my writing partner after a week 'Sorry, this is not my kind of roleplay' if I knew beforehand that this type of roleplays never catch my interest. I am not interested in writing a lawyer, police man, teacher or a doctor. I just don't know enough about these professions, and even if I did, they just don't appeal to me as the focus of a story. \n\nSo when they ask me if I want to try something completely new this time and present their idea that is modern with no fantasy, I politely decline. And when they ask me why, I tell them 'I can understand why people want to write that kind of stuff, but I am personally not interested. The times when I tried to write this I failed, and I don't think I know enough about (topic) to write a roleplay about it. I know that these kind of plots get boring for me quite quickly, sorry.' \n\nBut after declining, they still want to write it. They just shrug and say 'I will teach you anything you need to know, don't worry to much, silly.' If I still decline, they often act like I am unwilling to learn, which maybe is true. But honestly...there is stuff that I don't want to learn. \n\nFor me, roleplays are about having fun, and imagining characters and situations that I find interesting (and finding a partner who is interested in the same things). If neither the setting, nor the profession or the role of my character appeals to me, I will not have fun writing it. Even if I learn something.\n\nSame with fandoms, If I have to read 12 books that are not really appealing to me or watch a series with six seasons just so that I know what the world/plot of our roleplay will be about, I don't really want to learn. \n\nIf I tell people 'Sorry, but I am not interested, this plot does nothing for me.', why is that so hard to understand? 'If I tell them sorry, I never watched (series), I started watching it but it didn't appeal to me, therefore I don't know how the world works. Maybe we can think of something different?', I think that is a clear no. But people act like this is just a minor thing, and answer stuff like 'Okay, no problem, I am patient, I will wait till you finished the first season! I am so happy that we are going to write this.'\n\nSame with romance, I just don't have an interest in it. And people reply 'Oh, I will make sure that you are comfortable with it, we will take it nice and slow. I don't care if you are inexperienced with writing it.' And I think to myself 'Well...thanks? But that does not solve the problem that I just find it quite boring and have no interest in it, it is not a question of ability to write it.'\n\nAnd I have to repeat again and again that I am just not interested, which is super draining, because I don't want to hurt their feelings. I know that different people like different things, just because I consider something to be boring for me does not mean it has to be boring for everyone else...I just wish that people could accept when I am not interested.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I have a couple of partners that are really good writers and met all my criteria when we first started talking.  They seemed just as eager as I was about the ro story ideas and character relationships.  Then I made servers for both of them on discord and all of a sudden, they have nothing to say in character and only want to talk OOC.\n\nSo I asked them if they were no longer interested in the rp, stressing that I consider them both friends and that I wouldn't mind at all to stop the rp and just be chat buddies with them.  Both said they were still interested and still wanted to rp.  They once again sounded u credibly enthusiastic.  So I gave them another chance to post.  They didn't.\n\nThis has now become a cycle where I ask them if they're through with the rp, they say no, promise to.post something same day, and then son's despite me reminding them multiple times and getting clarification multiple times that I hadn't misunderstood them and they so, in fact, mean to post something.\n\nI am not a confrontational pperson, I understand being forgetful, or having a hectic schedule or day, or even needing to step back and take a break.  I am perfectly fine with any and all changes that might need to be made for my partner's comfort.  And above all, I detest being aggressive or mean, especially through text where something like tone can be so easily misconstrued.  But I' at my wits end here! This has been going on for weeks now!  I'm being blatantly lied to every day and it's really starting to make me angry.  What can I do to.fix this situation?  How do I make them understand that they're being jerks?  I don't want to hurt any feelings or end any friendships, but I also don't want to keep being thr rp doormat that people don't mind ignoring and lying to.  Any advice would be much appreciated!",

This has really made things tough, especially considering that last year i lost 3 family members as well, and we still haven't had time to mourn them as a family, so this feels like another straw on the camels back.   \n\n\nSo, I have made sure my RP partners know this, and as I went to tell one of my partners, I realised he had left the server and unfriended me. Ghosting, generally, doesn't affect me much. It is a fact of RP, and whilst it is a bummer for a while, it isn't too big of a deal. but right now, it hurts. he told me he was going through some tough stuff, so we put the RP on hiatus and I was there to be a soundboard when he needed to talk. I considered him a friend, and thought he did the same, but he just up and left, and now, considering all of this, it is really starting to hurt.   \n\n\nI get a ghoster or two wanting to leave and not cause issue. Whatever, I get it, but ffs, for it to happen so often is really upsetting. Most of my partners I consider friends, which is why we can be candid and say if we need a break or a rest or whatever. I try to make it as comfortable as possible, so people feel they can tell me if they aren't enjoying it. IDK, maybe its just that the rest of the day has been so horrible, but honestly ghosting is so selfish and rude.   \n\n\nEnd rant, I might delete this post in a few hours because i feel like i might have just spewed up nonsense, but I just wanna know why people do it because honestly this shit is really affecting my mental health",

Just because he had been \u201ctricking her this whole time.\u201d\nAnd then he asked me to make him a sex slave character for him, so I did because I didn\u2019t care to much, but he didn\u2019t even want to go the full mile. He refused to do erp, which I was ok with, but it was a bit annoying. And then he killed her off too! He said something about using the force to make her explode. And then he brought her back to life to do whatever the heck I wanted.\n\nI\u2019m glad I stopped rping with him.",

            "selftext": "I noticed a lot of this community seems to lack boundaries, so I thought I'd give a little primer.\n\n**What is a boundary?**  \nA boundary is a clearly defined limit of behavior that you give to another person or another person gives to you. In context of RP this might look like 'sometimes I'm busy and can't reply and I need you not to ask me to' or 'I only play female characters' or 'I don't write smut out in detail'. Often it has to do with a specific context, or how often someone is willing to post. \n\n**How are boundaries expressed?**\n\nIdeally, directly, but this is often not the case. People can express boundaries through a variety of means, such as refusing to write certain scenes. They can also express them by telling their partner they are busy. Believe it or not, even ghosting someone counts as setting a boundary.\n\n**How should I set a boundary?**\n\nAgain, ideally, directly. If you don't want to do something, say you don't want to. If your partner is poking you for posts too often, tell them to stop. If you don't want to continue an RP, simply say so and move on. The best way to set boundaries is to clearly state what the boundary is, then don't deviate from that.\n\n**What do I do if someone sets a boundary I don't like?**\n\nYou respect the boundary anyway. Sometimes people will set boundaries you don't like, or in a way you don't like, such as via ghosting you. You may see someone say they're busy, but then you see them posting elsewhere. You may want to write something another person really does not want to write. It doesn't matter. You can ask in some cases what's up, but you still need to respect their boundary. That includes not following them around to other places on the internet or harassing them to post. You can be hurt that they chose an unfair way to communicate a boundary, and your feelings are valid, *but you still need to respect their boundaries.*\n\n**What do I do if someone else is not respecting my boundary?**\n\nThat's up to you, but personally I go with no longer talking to or RPing with that person. I will always reset a boundary once or sometimes twice depending on the boundary, but people that repeatedly disrespect boundaries do not respect me as a person and I choose not to RP with those people.",

            "selftext": "The title basically says it all lmao. For those of you who write modern/realistic/slice of life plots, are you also finding it difficult to find partners who are willing to slow down and enjoy the ride as opposed to barreling through everything just to get to x or y scene/moment? I suppose that technically this question can be extended towards any sort of writer, but I am at a point where I am just extremely disheartened and genuinely want to know that I am not alone in this predicament. \n\nI began this roleplay with this chick, an mxm about two artists that have lost muse and eventually, key word, **!!!*****EVENTUALLY!!!*** find it in each other again throughout the course of the roleplay, as they fall in love and let one another in. This was supposed to be a romantic, gradual descent into emotions and into their reltionship. It seemed like we were on the same page in terms of limits, what we were seeking out of the roleplay, the vibes all lined and connected neatly, we were on the same wavelength. Until the actual writing started. I provided the starter and established the scene, etc., and after she provided her response to me she asked me ooc to please make my reply shorter \"now that the characters are actually interacting.\" O....kay....? I sort of just ignored that and wrote however much I felt was needed for my response, only to be met with a thirsty response from her. Her character is already all over my own character, being excessively flirtatious and even downright predatory (she wrote something about how her character was mentally undressing my own), even though the two literally just met and they're talking about a painting. That's it. I had my character walk away, because even ic he was a bit overwhelmed by the strange interaction, and she had written back how her character already feels inspired and hears a melody in his head (he's a composer who lost the muse for writing music) after this brief interaction with my character. Just like that, he's inspired, plot basically fucking over. Now she wants to rush to another scene where the two characters will interact and presumably, something physical will happen. \n\nIn another plot I am doing, the characters are best friends traveling the globe and documenting said travels professionally. The overall purpose/end goal of the plot is a friends-to-lovers thing, like a \"you've been here all along and I just didn't see you.\" Again, it seemed like everything checked out prior to actually beginning the writing process (well, almost everything), we discussed availability/frequency of responses, characters, established a backstory, etc. Ok. Cue the actual writing, once more I provide the starter, only to be met with something...odd. Everything I was writing from the perspective of my character, like what she is thinking, feeling, etc., my partner seems to be mirroring that back in their responses, almost as if responding to her thoughts with his own despite them not actually being verbalized. So for example, my character was contemplating how the journey won't last forever, her best friend will eventually want to go home, the temporary nature of everything etc., now coincidentally, the other character just got a call on the phone and he needs to talk to my character about what they're doing, about how long they'll be on the road, about how long this will all last. Just like that, rushed right into that question, right after my character was thinking about those things, no slowburn, no gradual lead-up to anything, just a mind-read and a convenience. \n\nI am just frustrated and demotivated. This type of fast-paced, rapid fire shit doesn't bring me any satisfaction, it's not fun and I don't know how to decipher who writes like this and who doesn't because prior to beginning the writing, it always seems like we are on the same page. I guess I need to start emphasizing *slowburn* more, even at the risk of sounding repetitive.",

So far I haven't seen this, unless I missed something, but the biggest rant I have are getting not SFW requests. I don't even mention that kind of content in my post because I am not looking for it. If people want it, they usually mention it, but I get so many requests for it. What annoys me about it though is when a guy turns me down if I refuse to include it in a role-play, and that's probably not the kind of role-play I am looking for. I want chemistry and romance and I've gotten some requests that frankly are not very romantic but purely about not SFW content. Even when I put I'm looking to a \"plot\" and a \"story\" to write. \n\nI mean one of the things I ask people not to do is to not ask me inappropriate questions. If someone asks that, should they be bringing up posts that are not SFW? Sometimes I feel like people don't read my requirements, tbh.   \nAny way, end of rant.",

            "selftext": "(Not to be confused with the lovely, wonderful RP Guru on YouTube.)  \n\n\nI'm specifically referring to **Karen** as the meme definition.   \n\n\nThese are the role players who feel like they know everything, they've probably run their own server before. Where is it now? It's closed, but that's beside the point! They had 100+ players, which means they were *SuCcEsSfUl.* Yeah, okay, **Karen**.   \n\n\nHow do you know they've run their own server before? Oh trust me, they'll tell you. Probably within the first two or three things they say upon joining yours. Just so *you* know that *they* know what they're talking about when they list everything you're doing wrong in yours.   \n\n\nA **Karen** will often answer questions for other players in your server, based on their own experience and logic, even if they only just arrived themselves. They're just trying to help the staff, because they know what it's like.   \n\n\nAlways thank a **Karen** for this. Do not dare to correct them: they'll condescendingly inform you that they based their answer off of what their *far more successful* server did. They'll also argue that they read something in your lore that supports their answer, while gleefully anticipating your immediate apology.   \n\n\nApologize to the **Karen**, immediately. Otherwise, you are a bully!  \n\n\nDo not send a **Karen** a screen shot with a clarification to support your claim. They will tell you that you are rude.   \n\n\nNever be rude to a **Karen**. (Correcting a **Karen**, no matter how you do it, is always rude). Do you know who this person is? You should! Their server might be closed, but it was twice the size of yours and you need to learn from them.   \n\n\nA **Karen** will frequently make vaguely insulting comments to your staff and players, but do not call them out on this. **Karen** was *joking,* you fool! You would know this if you were as smart as **Karen**.   \n\n\n**Karen** wants players and staff members to joke with them. These jokes need to be said in a way that glorifies any nugget of ~~poo~~ wisdom that flies out of any of their orifices.  \n\n\n A **Karen** is always allowed to make jokes at someone else or someone else's character's expense, because **Karens** know what they're talking about and it's all just banter.   \n\n\nBut! Never, *ever* joke about a **Karen** or a **Karen**'s character in a negative or \"bantering\" way. This is not joking. This is Bullying!   \n\n\nRemember, a **Karen** is as sensitive as they are smarter than you, which is a lot.  \n\n\nAlways greet the **Karen** first when you sign on. Otherwise, you will be seen as ignoring the Almighty **Karen**. This is also bullying!  \n\n\nSimilarly, if you say goodnight because you are going to bed, you *must* stay awake and online until the **Karen** bids you to leave.   \n\n\n**Karen** will likely not reciprocate in wishing you a goodnight, but instead **Karen** will acknowledge that it is, indeed, night. **Karen** does this to help players who cannot tell time or live in places without access to windows.   \n\n\nAbove all, a **Karen** is there to help. You are small and mildly stupid. Without your server's **Karen**, surely you will die by something as moronic as you are. **Karen** will protect you with their sage and boundless wisdom, but only if you are willing to accept their grace.   \n\n\n**Karen** will likely create something that isn't allowed in by your lore book. They will glance at it and give you a pat on the back for your efforts, but then they will apply what they think will be the most entertaining for them to play, regardless of your rules.   \n\n\nDo not tell your **Karen** they cannot do this. **Karen** sees what your simple, underdeveloped mind cannot see yet. You can't possibly understand it now, but your server needs a demonic dragon who delivers pizza. \n\nWhatever omniscient being **Karen** settles on will immediately be the most popular and smartest character you will ever see. Your staff and players should all play rock-paper-scissors to determine who will get to play with Karen first.  \n\n\n **Karen** has to work though, so be patient.  \n\n\n **Karen** may not get to you, **Karen** may not want to. You should take that as a sign that you have a lot of work to do on yourself. Thank the **Karen** for their feedback and take that feedback to heart. It will benefit you in life.   \n\n\n**Karen's** word is law. It does not matter how new they are. Rejecting a **Karen's** input is the worst decision anyone can make.   \n\n\nDo not *ever* invoke the wrath of your server's **Karen**. **Karen** is owed the ability to write with you in your server or your 1x1 story. If **Karen** wants to write with you, then you will write, or you will regret it.   \n\n\nA **Karen's** deadliest weapon is their words. They will use them like a whip upon your soul to tell you exactly why you are the lowest speck, unfit to do anything but worship a **Karen**.  \n\n\n But **Karen** is merciful.  \n\n\n After **Karen** has stalked you across Reddit, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, Disboard, Twitter, and numerous hub servers on Discord, leaving yelp-styled reviews throughout; **Karen** will calmly message you to see if you have changed your mind about refuting their god-like essence.   \n\n\n If you have banned them, they will return on an alt. Sometimes numerous alts. Each time, they will plague you like the nightmarish deity they are, with the same questions, the same concepts, the same tone of authority. Is it them? Or are you just paranoid because you *know* you have invoked the wrath of a **Karen** and their vengeance will be swift!  \n\n\n**Karen** will leave their reviews up on every ad you've ever made, as a permanent reminder to your failings, whether you let them back in or not, whether they stay or not. Because their opinion is the truest truth in life, and you must own your punishment. It will help you grow as a person.   \n\n\nRemember, **Karen** is here to help you*.* Know that you have been blessed by the **Karen** visiting your story. Keep their words logged. Frame them. Immortalize their lessons on your walls. One day, with devotion and work, you may be able to call yourself worthy of wiping the gracious ass of the **Karen**.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n[Or, ya know, ban 'em.

So for reference many of my rps have fallen mostly inactive as the other role players have gotten busy which is totally understandable it happens to us all. Which has lead me to seek out new partners and I managed to snag three over the past week or so and only one is still rping with me. The other two you might ask? As you can probably guess from the title. They ghosted me. Although this was slightly infuriating for me as the two ghosted me literally a day after we started rping like we got a few responses in each and then poof they vanished. For reference I rp on discord and they left the server we had set up and then removed me from their friends list. I had thought things were going off to a good start but I guess they just didn\u2019t want to keep going or something else Idk.",

She\u2019ll always claim that my character is saying they are NOT saying, and then gets pissed off when my character explains themselves and their view point.\n\nAlso, her characters make a HUGE point of saying \u201cif you dismiss or blow me off I\u2019ll just stop talking to you because I\u2019m not wasting my breath on someone like that.\u201d\n\nBut guess what? All of her characters can joke, demean, insult, misconstrue, dismiss and blow off ANYTHING my characters say easily, and my characters are just supposed to take it. But whenever my characters even do a HINT of that, her characters shut down, go ballistic, and even make my characters feel terrible for feeling slighted. It\u2019s like their characters CANT be accountable for anything. They can do and say anything they want, but you say ONE thing, and it\u2019s over. Their character lashes out.\n\nAlso. Whenever my character disagrees with anything their character says or does, my partner will often write her character in a stance of being a victim and having all this massive hate thrown her way. Almost ALL the characters she writes will agree with what her character said or did, and if they don\u2019t, they are seen as a joke or someone to ignore and dismiss. Yet this girl literally said \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk to people who\u2019re just gonna dismiss me.\u201d\n\nHell. My partner tried so hard to make one of my characters look stupid and selfish for not bowing down and kissing her characters ass, and honestly she just made herself look blatantly obvious. After a while, it just gets tiring. \n\nIf our characters are going to disagree, we might as well disagree without the victim pull, playing dismissive games, and just overall acting like a prick.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve come off as rude, but I just really don\u2019t know what to do.
