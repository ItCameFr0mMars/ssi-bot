It is actually one of the biggest turn offs I have when it comes to roleplay. It is when someone consistently makes everything about their character in terms of HC and RP.\n\nI recently met a partner who is really creative, and I do love how they set up a lot for their characters. (They answered my AD about doing a story I wanted to go over. So I knew I would be doing most of the set up until we got comfortable.) However, they are very 'self-absorbed' in terms of HC and RP. I find anytime I try to talk about my characters whether it is in character, or just little HC they immediately switch it to talking about their own. An example i's I mention something about my character playing an instrument, and they start going on and on about the list of instruments their own character can play.' Not even really absorbing anything I said about mine. So I just end up writing compliments over and over to them. There is also the habit that they show. I find myself about to tell that they get somewhat salty of things are not about their character.\n\nI have struggled to find partners because I admit I am the type of person to end things if I notice red flags. I do not think this person is intentionally doing this, but I do not know how to confess that this is really bothering me. I feel like my characters are either being pushed aside, or there is this sense of my partner trying to belittle me because they don't want their characters to be outshined. I am very frustrated with it, and I don't know how to be honest because I am admittedly afraid of getting a poor outcome. I don't dislike them in anyway, but this is a glaring issue I see in roleplayers quite often. I don't know if it is because I seem so receptive to listening to people talk about stuff that they just assume I will just listen forever. I mean I could be doing something myself to bring on this sense of competitive behavior? Since this is just my perspective it is hard to say. I feel that I try hard not to take the spotlight and consistently attempt to be mindful of my partner.",

It feels too weird, especially since I love adding romance to most of my RP.  This is a **heavy** generalization, but it's been been difficult for me to find rp with people 30+ who aren't riddled with red-flags.  It's been hard for me to find older adult communities that don't primarily revolve around smut.  I've considered dropping my age limit down to 25 to widen the pool, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate?  A decade feels a little weird, but I'd consider that age to be an adult.   Older RPers like me, where do find your roleplay (especially the SFW kind)?  How do you find age-appropriate partners?  I put my age in my ads already, but it there something else I should be doing?",

            "selftext": "This little vent takes place on a website that is specificely designed for searching roleplay-partners, so not reddit. Because they aren't that many users (still about 100 I would guess), there is a bit more of a community there, and I kind of know most users a least from seeing them being active in roleplays and ooc chat.\n\nThere are some positive and some negative aspects to that, and today I will focus on a negative one: it can create the worst kind of people who don't read (or ignore parts of) your search. On reddit and similiar sites, someone contacts you with 'Hey wanna roleplay?', you rather quickly notice that they never read your search, you confront them and most of the time, they never reply again.\n\nBut on sites like the one I write on, you sometimes encounter a different type. For example:\n\n**The entitled one**\n\nThis person contacts you with a very specific roleplay idea in mind, which often includes something you never do (or only did once, in another roleplay in that forum). You tell them 'sorry, but my search specifies that I don't want to write this at the moment'. \n\nInstead of apologizing and leaving, finding something else to write or just leaving, they will pull all the recipes of you talking about media that included this topic to other people ooc (watching a movie about something does NOT mean I want to write it or that I can write it well), and act like I lied to them. Often trying to guilt trip you into writing this very specific thing by saying something like 'You can tell me if you don't like me and just don't want to write with me. We could make this work, if you only wanted to.' Of course, this person will NEVER consider writing anything that is actually in your search, and if you ask them for that, they stop replying at all.\n\nThis also leads to super uncomfortable situations in the ooc chat, because sometimes, these people voice their frustrations with passive aggressive remarks, so you have to be careful never to mention the specific topic again, or you will be confronted with something like 'Oh, I did not know that YOU of all people would be interested in that kind of movie.'\n\n Yeah, I am sometimes interested in movies or books about topics I don't want to write roleplays about. That does not mean I lie to you when I say that I am not interested in writing that at the moment, ESPECIALLY if my search has multiple sentences about why and that I don't want to write it.\n\n**The two-faced one**\n\nThis person has either not read your search or constantly just replies with 'aha', 'hm', or 'I don't know.' (maybe both) So trying to set up a roleplay with them is an impossible task that only ends in frustration. Most of the time, they end up not replying anymore if you ask them if they even read your search or if they could contribute a little more.\n\nLater, you encounter them in the ooc chat...and it is actually funny how they portray themselves and how they really act during the planning phase. Once, a girl that never contributed ANYTHING except 'ok', 'hm' and so on during planning went on a rant about how she is sick and tired of doing all the planning in her roleplays, and about how hard it is to find partners who are really invested in creating a roleplay...\n\nOr someone vents about Jareds and people who don't read searches thoroughly...shortly after contacting you to roleplay with an idea that is explicitely mentioned as something you dislike, and getting angry because you don't want to write it with them/or just never replying after you point it out.",

            "selftext": "So here's the thing.\n\nI love roleplaying, but I've never actually been good at the social interaction element.\n\nI'm autistic and I have PTSD and social anxiety, and these things are constantly affecting my behavior towards others in a negative way. I have trouble recognizing boundaries, I have barely any patience to speak of, I get anxiety attacks, and often don't even recognize that I'm doing harm until it's too late. \n\nWhen I *do* recognize I'm doing harm, I end up getting caught up in guilt spirals. I try my best to control it but the harder I try the worse it gets. \n\nI recently ended up shooting my chances with a Discord rp group and the Tumblr community around it to pieces because my reaction to one thing I did ended up spiraling completely out of control. I ended up feeling guilty and embarrassed about it, and my immediate response was basically to rat myself out to everyone...which I am now feeling guilty and embarrassed about. The shortest version of it is that I did everything that you aren't supposed to do. I complained publicly about losing an rp partnership, violated someone's request for no contact, dragged other people into my personal problems, and overall have been rude and inconsiderate to people I cared about. \n\nI can't stop thinking about how badly I've fucked up and all the people I've hurt without even knowing, or all the opportunities I've lost because of it. It's often this very thing that brings out the worst in me. I'm also afraid of being haunted by a reputation. \n\nI am currently in therapy, but all I have access to is the bare minimum.\n\n**PLEASE DO NOT SCOLD ME/TELL ME I GOT WHAT I DESERVE/TELL ME STORIES WHERE YOU'RE A VICTIM OF THIS STUFF.** I'm already aware that I'm the source of these problems. I want to try to keep them from happening again. \n\nI want to do better.",

            "selftext": "I've found some decent writing partners lately, but a few of them have had really...interesting OOC habits. \n\nSome recent examples:\n\n* A slower-paced, multi-para 1x1 roleplay: every. single. time. my partner responds, they send me an OOC message saying \"did you like my post? \\[pleading face emoji\\]\" I'm starting to realize they expect me to compliment *every* post. We have an active OOC chat together so it's not like they have no idea if I like the RP or not. I do! \n* A fast-paced roleplay via instant messaging: We'll send 1 para posts back and forth, and my partner will send an OOC message saying \"reading\" after each post I send. My posts take like 30 seconds to read? Our RP is not so fast-paced I would be upset if you take a few moments to absorb what I've said. This partner usually replies within 10 minutes, which to me is *very* fast (I reply in like 30-45 mins when we're both online) so this OOC message is extra unnecessary. \n* An email roleplay: I have an OOC email chain going on with a partner where we discuss ideas and whatnot. This partner has a strange habit of addressing me as \"loser\"?! Like starting off OOC messages with \"Hey loser. Here's an idea I had...\" I know it's an attempt at being playful but like...I don't know you that well yet lol and I've given you my name. o.o  \n\n(I've addressed these concerns to each of these partners to varying degrees of success.) Anyone else experiencing small quirks with a RP partner that isn't enough to totally kill a RP, but is enough to give you pause?",

Maybe I should add that I am writing on a roleplaying site, not searching on reddit or anything, so there is more of a community and not so many members. My roleplay preferences and stories are rather uncommon (not that I would want super weird kinks or anything like that, I just don't really write romance and often base the stories I am looking for on rather unpopular/weird books). I get it, my searches seem strange to some and often don't attract many people who are interested. I don't care, this is what I like to write and most of the time, I find at least one person who wants to explore these roleplays with me.\n\nBut they also often attract people who just contact me to tell me how strange my searches are. They will write stuff like 'Do you really write stories without any romance, that is weird, how does it work?', I will explain it to them and they will say stuff like 'Wow, so this can work out? I still can't imagine how this works, but you do you! Good luck with your search.'\n\nOr they will contact me with stuff like 'Interesting search, I bet you don't find many partners with a story like that', I say yes, that is true, and they will reply something like 'It isn't my cup of tea either, but I hope you find someone. I also have some preferences many people don't share, keep looking. '\n\nThese are the nice ones, and I am not angry with them, although I sometimes wonder why they feel the need to contact me in the first place if they know they are not interested in writing with me. They are probably just trying to be nice and want to learn more.\n\nBut there are also people who kind of...attack me? Asking a dozen questions, always pointing out how boring or strange something is, giving me 'advice' on what topics to write when I want more partners or pointing out how I surely will have a hard time finding someone for this, and in the end just tell me that they personally aren't interested at all although they contacted me regarding my search...\n\nYes, I know that it is hard to find partners for my stories, I know that they are rather uncommon and maybe sometimes strange/weird, and I know that most people want romance in a roleplay.

One of the two main platforms I roleplay on is Amino, and I tend to have my profile layout as either one of my ocs, or a favourite character of mine from one of the (many) fandoms I'm in.\n\nI would just like to firstly say that I have no issue with anyone who is a fan of KPOP,  you do you, personally it's just not my thing. Anyway, one day I was approached via message by someone who wanted to do a plot, as far as I can remember, their profile was of a Kpop idol, but I didn't think to much of that, and I agreed, however they wanted to do a Kpop based plot about members of BTS. Now, I like to think I'm quite open when it comes to roleplaying, and most of the time, I will agree to try it out.\n\nHowever, the plots people usually come to me with are for fandoms (to date, I believe this instance is the only time someone has reached out to me wanting to roleplay a fandom I'm not in), and I give it a chance, but I do not know the members of BTS, or any Kpop band for that matter.\n\nThey asked me to be one of the members, I can't remember which, and they would be another member, and I politely declined, saying that I do not know those people and it wouldn't be fair if they were the only one actually wanting to do the plot. Did they listen? Nope.\n\nThey proceeded to send a starter, and when I told them I didn't know how to respond, they gave me suggestions on how to reply. I repeated myself, once again stating I didn't know the , and left the chat, I didn't want to put up with someone who wasn't going to listen when I declined their story.\n\nA few days go past, and in this time, I had changed my profile layout. They reach out again, which is fair enough, they probably assumed I was a different person. The exact same conversation, at least from their side, takes place. This time, though, I simply said no and left. I wasn't going to go through that scenario again.\n\nHaven't heard from them since.\n\nI mean no hate or disrespect to this person, they seemed excited about their idea, and I hope they found someone who was happy to do their plot, it just wasn't my cup of tea.",

I just feel like this is something that everyone here may struggle with and that is \u2014 someone not reading the entirety of your AD and messaging you anyways.\n\nIt really bothers me when this happens, and it\u2019s really clear when they don\u2019t read it through. So, for context, in my AD\u2019s I usually write out sort of what I\u2019m looking for. Things like, literate, descriptive, creative, etc. I also usually write out, how long I would like posts to be. I try to give some leeway, because I know that saying, I expect 3 to 4 paragraphs can sound like a lot. So I usually say 2 to 3 paragraphs, because you can also fit a lot into that many paragraphs. Though, from experience, when I say 2 to 3 paragraphs, people think I mean two, with maybe four or five sentences in each paragraph....\n\nI mean come on? This has prompted me to start asking for an example of their writing before I start anything with anyone. Because this is how it always is. I ask, \u2018Do you think you can write up to four paragraphs?\u2019 And they always say,\u2019 Of course!\u2019 And once we start writing; and my starter is close to five paragraphs. They respond with two. It\u2019s really starting to get frustrating. They also seem to get really upset when I say ,\u2019 Hey, I don\u2019t think this is going to work out very well.\u2019 And always end up cussing me out, over not really being impressed.\n\nAnd now, I\u2019m getting some people who are upset with me for asking for an example of their writing. They try to get out of it, by saying that they don\u2019t have one. So I ask if they can provide a character background or story, something so that I can see how they write. And they never answer. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand these things? Why would they message me, if my AD clearly said that I was looking for someone advanced? I don\u2019t even know where to look for a partner anymore. It seems that Reddit has gone pretty far downhill for advanced writers. It feels like all of the really passionate writers already have partners, or are taking a break. I just wanted to rant, see if things like this has happened to anyone else. Or if anyone has any good suggestions on platforms to try and find partners.",

This was posted in a group chat full of hundreds of roleplayers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Why do you care about how another persons oc looks? Honestly, why do you care so much. You don\u2019t know how awful it feels to get ghosted or when people leave a chat when I show them my oc.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Johnny *is my comfort character, and that fucking hurts when you basically say \u201chey, you\u2019re oc isn\u2019t attractive enough for my oc, this ain\u2019t gonna work\u201d WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT HOW HE LOOKS? It REALLY doesn\u2019t matter. If they get along, have a connection, and enjoy being around each other, looks literally do not matter. Yes, you are allowed to have an opinion on an oc\u2019s looks. But don\u2019t /tell/ someone you don\u2019t like their oc. \u201cyour oc is ugly\u201d LIKE- WHAT!? How SHALLOW can you be to actually say that to someone, it\u2019s ridiculous. But seriously, please be a mature and respectful human being and don\u2019t be a jerk. Thanks.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Id prefer if they just kept their thoughts to theirselves and continue with the rp.*** *Because again, looks shouldn\u2019t matter. Or if you\u2019re one of those people who likes perfect oc\u2019s just make up an excuse and leave.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n... and yet the same people say that they hate ghosters, or that nobody wants to roleplay with them. Nobody can win. We must all lie and pretend to be happy and jolly about everything. Yeah? /s\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly don't think the person Bad was calling out said that. I think it's just the person saying, \"I'm not into his looks, sorry.\" (Paraphrase, again.) And Bad took it as a personal affront, which is expected I suppose because **\"is my comfort character\" kinda' sounds like a nice way to say it's your self-insert.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a similar experience before where someone came to me with their drag queen character, and I'm sorry, but I'm not into it, and **if I'm not into it, I'm just not going to be able to hype up my narrative.** Sure, you can say a homicide author isn't going to be into murder but can still write it, and good on them, from the bottom of my heart, but like I told my dad: \"If you want to compare me with someone else, let me ask you. Someone was a president at 40. Why aren't you a president too?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's why my roleplay friends say my writing makes them feel like they're reading into my OC's mind as if he's a person in real life. In this second case, I even specified in my ad: \"I'm hoping to pair my OC with someone about his aesthetics.\" (It's a MxM roleplay community and my character was your usual athletic, scruffy, spornosexual kind of dude.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy not just cut it short politely and move on so both can find more suitable writing partners? I literally said, with honesty and as much kindness as I could muster: \"I'm sorry! I'm inexperienced with writing against drag characters, and I'm too unfamiliar with them IRL, with the few experiences I've had being unpleasant. I don't think I can write with your choice of OC for 1x1.\" They went off on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously, just accept that **not everyone will like your OC with their OC**, because you can't expect every Tinder profile to be a match, right?

We did a roleplay involving childhood friends.\n\nAfter moving to discord and role playing with them for a bit. I realized two things. 1. I did not ask their age like I did with my other partners (I usually do this for comfortability reasons) and 2. I did not say whether or not I was comfortable with smut which I feel was my fault and I take responsibility for that.\n\nDuring the NSFW part of the role play, he asks, \u201cif I want to see it.\u201d I said okay somewhat knowing what to expect? Again another place I went wrong. He sent it, then asked for me to send.\n\nI kept leading him on because I wasn\u2019t going to send and eventually I\u2019m sure he got that. He would comment things like \u201cstill waiting \ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd75\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re such a tease \ud83d\ude14\u201d and then delete it before I opened the message up in discord. After the NSFW part was done he stopped responding but was still in the server.\n\nToday I checked again to see if he was still there and sure enough he left. So now I know to A. Ask for their age, B. Let them know when I\u2019m uncomfortable C. Learn how to set boundaries and how to tell people No.\n\nI wanted to share this because it sucks, I actually liked our roleplay (beside the nsfw) but maybe it\u2019s for the best.",

It was detailed and seemed too have a lot of effort behind it and I saw that no one upvoted it or commented at all so I figured I\u2019d reach out. We chit chat and hit it off great. We move over too discord and chit chat some more exchanging some info about one another like our time zones names writing type etc etc. then when it\u2019s time too roleplay I start us off with a pretty good and sizable chunk of writing. He said he loved it and all. He responded back with just about the same size ten minutes later and I\u2019m like \u201cSweet\u201d and respond right away. Well like 30 minutes goes by and I get on discord not too bother him but because a friend messaged. After talking too my friend for a bit I realize it\u2019s late and message him saying \u201cHey imma log off for the night have a good night bro\u201d only too see I\u2019m blocked. I thought that maybe it was my wifi or something but no he blocked me left the discord server and I\u2019m pretty sure he blocked me here on Reddit too. I\u2019m really bummed because the roleplay seemed awesome and he just ghosted me. Idk what I did wrong exactly either. I matched his energy perfectly while still staying original. Any thoughts?",

I ignore it, because most people don't use discord just for RolePlay like I do. (I have a designated account for gaming, and one for RolePlay just to keep it organized.) Been six hours of being online, and I finally message, because we are both in Texas. They said they aren't going to work for a while because of the snow, and they were going to be more free. So I asked if they are doing alright, since my power has been coming off and on sort of unexpectedly, and my water had been turned off for a while. I sit in front of my computer, doing other things while discord is open on my other monitor... and see them go offline.   \n\n\nThis is has happened to me before too. It had been multiple weeks last time though, and I gave them space because I really enjoyed their work. I saw every time they went online, and I sent one message asking if they wanted to continue or not. They never answered, I eventually just unfriended them and saw one of their AD's a few hours later :/  \n\n\nI decided to just leave it this time around, because once again, I am really enjoying our RolePlay, but it just sort of upsets me. I guess because it's pretty easy to message a few words, letting me know you're okay, and that you just don't feel up to RolePlay. Or if I did something they didn't like? From some comments on this subreddit I realize that a bunch of people hate these types of problems lmaooo.  \n\n\nI don't think it's that bad of a request, and I make it known before we ever start anything, that I'm really particular when it comes to availability. So if they don't like it they can pull out before we start. I guess I think it's a bit of a respect thing. If we are going to be partners and *create* something together, I just like some transparency.",

            "selftext": "So recently I set up this fun little murder mystery rp/interactive story thing on  forum.  Basically it's set up to be played out over the course of about two weeks, with me releasing story updates involving the event OCs (which are my characters and the suspects and investigators in the murder mystery) every few days to move the plot along.  All participants play a part in the narrative and can interact with one another as well as find clues for the murder by investigating the location or talking to the event OCs.\n\nOne of the major rules for the event OCs is that I allow participants to control and voice the event OCs as long as they don't have them do anything TOO major, take them wildly OOC from the basic personalities, answer questions pertaining to the case at large themselves, or create backstory for them (though I do allow them to say how they are related to the OC, such as they were classmates, or neighbors, simple things).\n\nSo this one participant.  Let's call her Sleuth.  We're at a point in the story where the murder has just happened and my detective character is questioning people on what they've seen.  Everything is going fine until she gets to Sleuth.\n\nNow Sleuth just needs to show how amazing and deductive and SMART her character is.  So she goes on and on about how she (my detective character) had huge bags under her eyes and bad skin (right now we're treading close to Nope territory.  But since the character is an overworked detective mid-investigation this isn't too out there) due to stress relating to a recent tragedy (Officially starting to violate the no adding backstory rule but at this point it's still vague enough I might have allowed it).  Sleuth then 'correctly' (note the sarcastic quotations) deduces that this tragedy it due to Detective having just lost a baby to brain cancer and she con no longer conceive a child leading to marital turmoil.  Sleuth then writes Detective breaking down into a fit of weeping because she was 'correct' and Sleuth ends her post comforting Detective and helping her mourn her loss.\n\nIf there's a 'stunned silent' equivalent to writing that was the moment I was having right there.  Not only did she do what I specifically said not to, create backstory for an event OC, she was so wrapped up in the soap opera she created that she completely ignored anything to do with investigating the murder and advancing the plot.  She also completely ignored the character backstory I had already set up.  All the event OCs had a paragraph or so on personality/background, nothing lengthy at all but enough so characters could be familiar with one another.  And Detective I mentioned as being unmarried but in a happy relationship with her *girlfriend* whom she shared an apartment with.\n\nLuckily Sleuth agreed to change her post after I messaged her about... All The Wrong, but the fact that she responded to it like that at all just still blows my mind.",

I mean, evil characters are often not really well liked by other characters, especially those who are effected by their actions.\n\nBut I had a writing partner once, and our ooc chats never failed to surprise and annoy me when it came to that. She would go into detail on how her evil character ( a demon, who she always claimed was super evil) would destroy a plan my characters made, or even physically hurt someone close to them or one of them. And if I said something like 'Oh, that sounds wicked! Charlie (my character) will be sooo angry.' or 'It will take a long time until this can be forgiven by (other character of mine)' she would backtrack immediately, telling me how her character won't do it now, or making up excuses why these actions are not really evil?\n\nLike, EVERY time I said that my character would be hurt or angry, or even just annoyed by her character's actions (which were designed to hurt, annoy or anger people) she changed her plans and got moody, as if I said something wrong. Soon, I avoided commenting anything on her plans ooc, because it would always lead to her changing them.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not just a problem ooc. It was the same during the roleplay. She would write a scene with me, her evil character would do something evil and laugh menacingly...but if my character cried and pleaded for their life or said something like 'I will revenge my dead puppy!\" and got angry, her characters behavior would change immediately.\n\nAnd he would go into 'I really did nothing wrong, and of course I would never kill you, silly, even though I just killed multiple people right before your eyes some minutes ago.'\n\nAfter a while, I really didn't know how she wanted my characters to react anymore. Our ooc chat would go like this:\n\nher: I have the ultimate evil plan for Sullivan (she explains her plan)\n\nme: wow, this is really evil. Charlie will be devasted.\n\nher: wait no. (changes everything so that the plan isn't really evil anymore)\n\nBut if I told her that I didn't see her character as completely evil, that also wasn't the right reaction. She wanted her characters to be the greatest villains that ever lived...but without allowing my characters to react in any way to this.\n\nUltimately, I ended the roleplay, because her behavior made no sense to me and so did the behavior of her 'evil' characters.",

Usually, I'm very careful not to do this because it's very stressful for me to be expected to write so much for different people (especially when I have other time-demanding hobbies), but I've incidentally gotten myself in a bit of a pickle. Lately, I only do one-on-one roleplays\u2014Usually \"doubling up\" which is always a recipe for some kind of disaster, I know\u2014But I like it, and it's helped me write a lot at the cost of my sanity lol. Jokes aside, \"doubling up\" is a very demanding concept, and the majority of the community I'm in does \"double up\". Some people are genuinely terrific writers and I love doing it, but it can get draining.\n\nOn the other hand, I have quite a few roleplays that fizzle out a few weeks or a month and they suddenly come back all at once. Or new players finally make that starter they were getting around to. Me being the yes man I am, I can't say no to anyone and feel bad for not being the last to reply after we continue\u2014Even if it's a person that has ghosted me before. I'd honestly rather be ghosted than be the one to leave someone hanging, but that's seeming a little unlikely  at the moment.\n\nSometimes roleplayers are simply forgetful of the roleplays we have and join new ones, only to get overloaded at some point. I get that and I hate that which is why I avoid that at all cost. I've made it a habit to keep my one-on-one roleplays at such a minimum that even more than five overdoes it for me, but that's the thing: In this hobby, you can't really expect to have 5 lasting for long all the time. I've just grown accustomed to that mentality, even when it isn't always true. So, when I don't get ghosted 5 times in a row and I suddenly have over 5 going on, I get burnt out and go silent like an asshole on half of them until someone sends me a reminder. :,) I know  I'm the bad roleplayer in this scenario, but gosh this seriously does suck. I seriously wish I could write 10 different replies of 600 to 700 words in one to two days on top of real life responsibilities like college essays and homework. On top of all that, I honestly do play favorites and try to reply quicker to the ones that interest me, but then that leaves the others hanging and gahhh I hate it.\n\nThis was a bad idea and I don't know how to approach everyone and tell them that I might not get to respond in awhile, if ever? At least, not at the same length.",

            "selftext": "Especially when I've already stated that ***it makes me super uncomfortable.***\n\nFor the sake of privacy for both me and the person involved, I won't disclose what the kink is.\n\nI've been rping with this person for a while now, though I'm taking a bit of a break for mental health and family reasons at the moment. I've stated upfront before the rp that I didn't want kink or smut, and that it makes me uncomfortable. They seemed okay with it, until further along into the story...\n\nWe were writing a pretty dramatic scene (which in hindsight, I found a little triggering, as it involved some abuse) and they wanted one of the characters they were playing to \\*ahem\\* inflict the subject of the kink onto another character.\n\nI told them right away that I wasn't okay with it, and to please have their character do something else, since it made me really uncomfortable. Once again, they agreed without much trouble...\n\nOnly to try and sneak some of that kink in through the character's dialogue.\n\nNow, I think of myself as being lenient, I don't like to be strict when it comes to boundaries. But thinking back on that scene and dialogue, I wish I'd spoken up about it. I physically cringe whenever I happen across that scene when I read through the roleplay posts for the sake of reading.\n\nIt's really not okay, and I've considered bringing it up to them if we ever decide to resume where we left off, but aside from that, I've really enjoyed the rp. I'm worried I'll just upset them and they'll drop me like a newborn giraffe.\n\nHas anyone else had a problem like this? I'm curious to know.",
