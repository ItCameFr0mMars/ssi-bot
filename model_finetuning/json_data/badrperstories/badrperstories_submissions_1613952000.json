            "selftext": "Because a lot of people complained to me that they never find partner with their ads or when they were looking for partners in chat, I tried to summarize some advice for newbies or people who have been frequently told that they might be the bad roleplayer and don't know why. Because a lot of times while I was talking to these people, I soon knew why. \n\nOf course, I will not list stuff that cannot be avoided here. For example, nobody should force themself to write smut, or search for a different fandom because their own is not well-known. \n\n**No 'Main character syndrome':**\n\nDon't write your ad as if your character was the main character in an anime. That is not to say that I dislike anime, but if your character is the main focus (orphan, chosen hero of the prophecy, the only one in this world who can do magic, the most beautiful and special girl alive, and so on), and the characters you are looking for are basically 'Eh, and you can be some random girl I meet and safe.' or 'you can be a sidekick that helps my character.' or 'you can write all the guys/girls in their reverse harem/harem who falls in love with them', why should other people be interested in writing with you? (I am talking about roleplays that are story roleplays, not only smut roleplays)\n\nYes, I know, some people like damsel in distress characters and harem, but at least give the people you want to write with a little bit to work with. Try to think not only about 'Why do I want to write this roleplay?' but also about 'Why should someone else want to write this roleplay with me?' Your character is not the main character, he is supposed to be one of the main characters, together with the characters of your writing partner.\n\n I know that a lot of people do this unknowingly, because they are so used to it from games/anime/Tv-shows, and a lot of times they do consider what their writing partner wants when it comes to the actual planning phase, but this is one of the red flags for Mary Sues many people look out for and avoid.\n\n**No forced relationships:**\n\nTry to get the hint if someone does not see a relationship, be it friendship/romantic/enemies or something like 'adopted child' happening. If someone tells you:\n\n\"Sorry, I don't think this really fits my plans for my character.' or 'I can't really see my character being such close friends with anyone', that does NOT mean 'Please convince me and try to sell me a storyline were my character's personality gets so fundamentally changed that it will be possible.' or 'Please tell me that in fact, you know my character better than I do and list all the reasons why you think that it has to happen.' It means no. They are trying to politely tell you that they can't envision it ever happening.\n\nEspecially in group roleplays, this is one of the biggest no-nos I can think of, and it will quickly earn you a reputation for being clingy and not taking no for an answer. \n\nEven with the best outcome for you (they hesitantly agree after 'discussing' it with you for a while), the only thing that will become of it most of the time is that they will loose all interest in their character, because now they are stuck in a storyline with relationships they don't want to explore and they had to change their character to someone they have no interest in writing.\n\n**Try to show an interest in your partner's characters:**\n\nYes, it might be interesting for them to know that your character is good at playing multiple instruments. But if they are currently telling you something about their character, sometimes, you should sit back and listen, and ask questions. Do not immediately start telling them about something similiar that relates to your character. An example for a conversation like this is:\n\nThem: My character Antonia has this little flute, she inherited it from her deceased mother.\n\nYou: My character Silvio actually can play the flute quite well, but he prefers other instruments. You know, even in grad school, his teacher always told him he had a special musical talent. One day, when he went with his parents to Italy, he...\n\nSome of this information COULD be interesting for your writing partner. But people also want interaction, they want to hear stuff about their characters, too. I heard so many people complain that they had a unique and special OC, but for some reason, nobody seemed interested and even rather bland characters had more writing partners in group roleplays.\n\nAnd when I tried to write with them, everything was only about their OC, their special experiences, unique talents, (sometimes  mental health issues and disabilities) and cool backstory. It was like a novel which only focused on one character with someone telling you about every minor thing this character had done in their life. Sometimes I did think 'Yeah, this character concept is cool' but I just got no actual interaction with my character out of the roleplay.\n\n**Don't use your writing partner as your personal place to vent all your frustrations with roleplaying:**\n\nYes, roleplaying is hard sometimes. Yes, you meet a lot of ghosters or people who do not put much effort in their roleplays. Almost everyone who has been in this hobby for a while knows this.\n\nBut nothing is more annoying than people constantly projecting their past experiences on you. If I am in the planning phase of a roleplay, I don't want to constantly hear 'This roleplay won't work out anyway, none of my roleplays did.' or 'Honestly, I don't find roleplays entertaining anymore, I am only here for the nostalgia. I think that this roleplay might disappoint as well, but we will see.'\n\nHearing about this one time is fine, but if every ooc chat is just venting about this and baseless accusations against your writing partner, it is a big red flag.\n\nIt is killing all my motivation to always be accused of just ditching someone, especially if there is absolutely no reason for my writing partner to think I would do something like that. It feels like I constantly have to prove myself to them, and for me and many other people, that is the opposite of a fun roleplay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have some advice to add?",

This will result in an immediate 70% of ads no longer applying to you, as most ads require some degree of smut and a sizable chunk explicitly state \"will not fade to black\". Be prepared to see a Very Interesting Ad and experience disappointment when the writer states they want the entire deal. Resume browsing ads and continue to experience disappointment.\n\n**Step 2**: If you are in any sort of social group, be prepared for Judgement \u2122! Other writers will either assume you are some sort of puritan weirdo or constantly make statements that you just \"haven't had good smut, yet\" (which sounds creepily similar to what's been said to non-straight/ace people. *Y I K E S*!)**\\***. Also be prepared for the discussion of NSFW topics to get cranked to 11. Optional: people scrambling to post a half hearted \"it's okay if you don't write smut, too!\".\n\n**Step 3**: Be prepared to be contacted by people with the reading comprehension of a doorknob when you explicitly state, multiple times, in your ad that you fade to black/don't write smut. These people will inevitably either present a kink list or declare their/their character's role in the bedroom. Alternatively, their own ads will be very kink heavy and it's fairly obvious on what they're interested in. There is also a strong possibility that any plot they present will be romance heavy with emphasis on when the characters *FUCK*.\n\n**Step 4**: Get entirely burned out on romance because it's all people want. At this point, be prepared to be declined by other writers because you're not interested in a role paly where the characters get together. Bonus points if the character they want you to write wouldn't be interested in romance due to: personal trauma, personal obligations, or any other reason.\n\n**Optional Step 5**: Actively begin to hate yourself for your disinterest in writing smut. If you're ace or have other factors that contribute to your refusal to write smut, feel free to add in some self loathing with self deprecating language towards that aspect of yourself. It's free real estate!\n\nI'm ManTheYeetCannons and thanks for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*Note**: the author of this role play guide is ace and has heard this multiple times over the years in regards to their personal real life.

            "selftext": "Hi. It's my first time on this sub. I've roleplayed since I was 12 years old and now 23, I've seen \\*a lot\\*. Ghosting has always been a thing in this community and always will be; at this point, I've written up a starter document with what I'm looking for as well as explaining to people that they can be honest with me about their frustrations, so on. If you wanna stop writing, that's okay; but just tell me so we can part ways nicely. Online communication isn't always easy, but at least we can try our hardest to make it work! : )\n\nSince I implemented that document I've encountered last ghosting and when it does happen, I try not to take it too personally but.. A few months ago I encountered this guy and we created a lovely story. We also chatted OOC a lot to the point where we developed an online friendship. We'd write pretty much every night while chatting and it was.. nice. Until halfway through December when he expressed something had come up with a family member. He'd be driving home all day and promised he'd let me know when he'd arrived home safely.\n\nI never heard from him again.\n\nNormally, when people ghost; they simply leave the server but his account remained. And so I worried, wondering if he'd gotten into an accident or perhaps caught COVID. Yesterday, I went through my Reddit messages and found his Reddit. He only has one post on there, which is old; so I logged into an old account and messaged him just to see if I'd get a reply if he didn't know it was me.\n\nLow and behold; I got a reply.\n\nI've been worrying about a guy for two months when he didn't respect me enough to let me know he was no longer interested in writing or talking to me. And that hurts.\n\nI absolutely love roleplaying, but over the past few years, I've wondered if it's still worth situations like these, putting time into stories only for someone to leave the server; especially when I've made clear upfront that they can be honest with me. I know it's hard for people; it's hard for me too, which is why I let them know I'm not one to get angry when they express their feelings.\n\nHow do you guys cope with this? Does all the ghosting kill your roleplay spirits too sometimes?",

            "selftext": "Has anyone else found that their creativity and incentive has dwindled away to almost nothing? I rediscovered this roleplay hobby over a year ago, pre-pandemic, and was like a kid in a candy store. I was so excited to write again -- somehow having a partner helps me sustain my creative momentum, plus you can always brainstorm your way out when you hit a block -- and I was happily exploring storylines and characters with a whole range of players. At one point, briefly, I even had as many as \\*cough\\*cough\\**thirteen* different storylines going! Some were way more laid-back/infrequent than others, mind you, but still, that was a *lot*.\n\nAnd then, I dunno, something shifted. Maybe I was stretched too thin (okay, definitely), but I think it was also just all this sustained isolation. I *do* have a full-time job, and I've been working throughout the pandemic, on-premise, which in a way has been a lifeline, since I still get a smidge of social interaction with my co-workers and clients. But by and large, I'm alone for most of it (it's a night job), and on top of staying pretty much homebound the rest of the time, my interaction with friends and family has dwindled to phone calls, texting, and the occasional Zoom.\n\nFor a while, roleplay was my escape, and I was happily maintaining a handful of ongoing plotlines up until a few months ago. But then almost all of them just petered out, one by one. And it was nothing against my partners -- they're all skilled, talented writers. The thing that shifted was with me. I just couldn't seem to find the incentive anymore. Conjuring up a post, getting into a character's head, composing thoughtful words... it all felt daunting rather than exciting.\n\nAnd the truly frustrating part is that I still *want* to write. I still get ideas for storylines and characters to roleplay, and I still occasionally try and put feelers out. But somehow, once we get past that initial brainstorm phase and it's time to write, I just... can't. The muse is on vacation, I guess, and I don't know when she'll be back.\n\nSo yeah, I'm the bad roleplayer in this scenario. I still want to give it a go, but my interest and incentive keep fizzling out. It's like I've got the literary equivalent of impotence. The desire's there but my brain won't cooperate.\n\nIf you're one of those folks I've brainstormed with and then drifted away, my apologies. I promise, it's not you, it's me.\n\nAnd this stupid neverending pandemic.",

We did, however, used to have someone in our group who we had a serious problem with. Let's call this person Lydia. \n\nLydia tends to get frustrated easily, and she lets it bleed into the roleplay. Every character that she has written would usually act annoyed and constantly micro analyze everything our characters were doing. It was like she thought she was better than us, but she also has a bunch of inconsistencies and flaws herself. \n\nWe've tried talking to Lydia about this problem many times, but it usually falls onto deaf ears. \n\nBut the most frustrating thing she ever did to me was when she made a blatant copy of my character. \n\nMy character is the son of a retired superhero, well respected by the world. His mother got killed when he was young, which prompted dad to come out of retirement. My character finds out and wants to take on the mantle, so dad trains him. He's the type of guy who never gives up, and is constantly getting into fights. \n\nLydia's character, however, is the son of a guy who played a superhero on TV. The guy was a bit crazy and trained him to become a superhero. \n\nThey both don't possess any superpowers, so imagine if I made Robin and she made Nightwing who isn't connected to him. Bonus points for her Nightwing ending up being shitty. \n\nHer character also got into a fight with my friend's character. My friend's character has a lot more experience and training, but her character somehow fends for himself. Lydia ignores a punch to the face, ignores a flashbang to the face, and even a smoke grenade. \n\nWhat's shocking is that Lydia admitted to my friend that her character is meant to be a better version of mine, which is messed up. I called Lydia out on this, and she totally made a bullshit excuse. \n\nBut anyways, she eventually left the group because she claimed to have too much stress from IRL and she wasn't having as much fun. We all have things going on IRL, but it's no excuse for her to treat our characters poorly.",

I really don't need a paragraph about how your characters clothes sound every single time they move and I certainly don't need multiple paragraphs with them talking to an npc while mine is left in the background/non-existent in their replies.\n\nLonger replies aren't good simply because they're \"lengthy\". They need to have substance, the details need to contribute to the story, and the characters need to interact or at least be trying to interact. \n\nFor example: If you send me 6 paragraphs where your character isn't doing anything beyond standing around and interacting with an npc, and I send you four back where my character is literally fighting to get to yours before actually finding them by the end, bringing enemies along they'll have to fight together, which post has offered more to the roleplay and benefits both of us? \n\nA shorter reply doesn't mean it offered less to our story.

            "selftext": "No, most likely, you don't.\n\nOf course, this post will not be about how everyone should be obligated to write the things that I prefer in a roleplay. I am firm believer that people should only write topics, genres and characters which they like, because roleplaying is a hobby, not a job, and it should be fun.\n\nBut here is a little pet peeve of mine from when I was younger. Nowadays, I usually don't reply to these type of ads. But because I always knew that my preferences (no smut/most of the time also no romance) are a bit hard to find, in the beginning, I always saw these searches which were basically 'Hey, I am open for writing anything/Really, I like everything, I have no real dislikes' (and some stuff about how long their replies are, how often they write) and I thought well, what could go wrong with someone as open-minded as this?\n\nEverything. Most of the time, everything went wrong. Note: This took place in a forum which did not have the m4m, f4m or f4f system roleplaying sites on reddit have. So most people who only want write a certain gender write this into their preferences.\n\nI contacted them and the chat went like this:\n\nMe: Hey! I saw your search, and I am interested. I am mainly searching for fantasy roleplays, but I am open for horror roleplays as well.\n\nThem: Yes, sounds great, I am free. But I kind of only write slice of life, no fantasy or anything related.\n\nMe: Ah, okay, so slice of life it is. I hope that you are okay with me writing nearly no romance. We can include it, if it is not the only focus of the roleplay. I mostly write male characters.\n\nThem: No, you have to write the girl, because there absolutely has to be romance and I don't write girls.\n\nOf course, I realised that they are not open for everything then. Almost all of these writers did have VERY clear preferences. Everyone wanted to include romance, but some also wanted to include veeery specific kinks. They only did certain genres, and also most of the time had very specific expectations of what kind of characters I should write. Some person I contacted even wanted only wanted to write to a very specific fandom from the 80s, she even had the face claims ready!\n\nSo my point is: If you have likes, dislikes, specific preferences and fandoms, include them in your search!\n\nIt makes searching sooo much easier, for everyone involved. For example, if you don't write one of the most popular genres (fantasy), I don't really get how you could get the impression that you are basically open for writing everything. I get that many writers don't realise that there are people who write non-romance, but disliking the whole genre of fantasy is definitely something that you should include when it comes to dislike.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m just ranting at this point so it\u2019s gonna be lengthy stuff. I\u2019ve written about this person and their behaviors before, but their character is just- yikes.. \n\nDanganronpa OC killing game Discord server, this person, let\u2019s call her May, plays a antagonistic character similar to Nagito Komaeda. She\u2019s admitted that her character is a blatant self-insert, it surely can\u2019t be that bad right? The character application says otherwise. \n\nRight off the bat, she revealed that her character has a fake personality. She didn\u2019t even bother to DM the host that information and just dumped it there for all of us to see. There\u2019s a huge list of mental disorders that\u2019s probably only there to make the character go crazy. It just feels insensitive as it\u2019s just a plot device.. This character doesn\u2019t really have any personality besides \u201cI\u2019m super nice\u201d and \u201cMHWAHAHA IM GOING TO KILL EVERYONE\u201d.\n\nThe actual character backstory feels like it was ripped off from the canon source. It doesn\u2019t help that May\u2019s character is the only one with connections to canon characters (which is impossible due to the setting). It seemed obvious that she had just finished the canon material and wanted to flaunt her knowledge. It\u2019s an OC RP unrelated to canon material, we don\u2019t need to see your character flexing her relationship with Kokichi. When I questioned why she decided to make her character a Nagito rip-off, she responded with \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on giving my character connections to Nagito\u201d. Like what? I asked you why your character acted like him, not if you character knows him. It became obvious that her character was a Mary Sue at that point.\n\nPlease don\u2019t play a antagonist if you expect constant praise from our characters. May had to turn her character back to normal because our characters were apparently cowards for avoiding her. She was beating people up, why would we talk to her? No one wants to talk to her still, so she turns her character insane again and threatens to kill everyone. I don\u2019t know how this solves the issue.\n\nEven after all of this, May expects us to save her and begs us to not kill her off. She\u2019s avoided the main aspects of the game such as investigations and trials, but still wishes to be adored. At least Nagito was useful, May\u2019s character doesn\u2019t provide anything to our game. You put a character into a killing game, you risk the character being killed, that\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s kinda why I\u2019m iffy on having self-inserts in a RP like this, people tend to take things personally.\n\nI know this may seem out of place but it\u2019s been bothering me. A recent behavior I\u2019ve noticed that she comments on my unrelated animations with her character\u2019s thoughts? I would upload a video to YouTube and she would make her character sulk about the roleplay in the comment section. Like, it\u2019s a video of my OCs dancing, why is your character crying about how she\u2019s gone insane in my comment section? It feels like May can\u2019t separate people from their character because SHE IS HER CHARACTER.\n\nThese last few months have been irritating. So sorry that I had to make another post about her. I\u2019m kinda stuck dealing with this person since it\u2019s a group RP and we\u2019re too far in to do much.",

One of the things that irritated me was the sheer amount of times someone would join, copy/paste what was essentially Yennefer from The Witcher's back story, as well as the actress who pays her in the show. Ugly duckling back ground, studied for hundreds of years, is about 600-1000 years old, overpowered with magic. Kept her name! And they would ignore the setting completely, like within seconds posting their character sheet for the character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was infuriating. What really got me was the one set after the zombie apocalypse. Somehow we were supposed to put Yennefer in there. And they *never changed her name.* This was at the height of The Witcher's popularity, so I get why people were into her. But...please...I just wanted to roleplay my modern supernatural RP. Had they read the lore, they'd know immediately she wouldn't fit. But they didn't. None of them did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe even had a \"no canon tv/movie/book characters\" rule, but did that stop them? Nope. Reminds me of the guy who just copy/pasted his Bakugo \"OC\"(My Hero Academia) with the same picture and pretty much the same background, even had the gall to put in there that he always called his power a \"quirk.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, there's a time and place for that. I get casting a wide net, but it was so irritating.",

Apparently because I had carried on the notion of the character from my writing sample I only want to play one character... yeah ok that\u2019s not the case but when I looked at the current characters any younger sibling would be quieter in comparison because they all seem to have huge egos and throw major tantrums all the time jeez! notice all the \u201cstaff\u201d are noble characters and people who submit templates like me keep leaving...

Let's call them Lucy. So, it started off as good, finding out what we were going to do and all, sharing our ocs all of that blah blah blah.   \n\n\nBut, then after a while into the roleplay, they took it to where they were wanting my male character to be a girl and as a transgender \\[FTM\\] it gave me a bit of dysphoria and on another side, I honestly don't want people trying to convert my boy characters into a girl. I then, told them about this and told them to \"Please don't do this. It gives me dysphoria.\", Lucy ended up kind of being a but rude as I told them that doing this was making me not able to breathe and my chest felt very heavy because of this.  \n\n\nLucy then went to say something but, I can't remember correctly but, it was in between the lines of, \"Anxiety and depression makes no sense to me.\" This upset me just a tiny bit because for one I wasn't even talking about that and was talking about dysphoria and it kind of sounded like they didn't think anxiety and depression wasn't a real thing, this was the first problem, now off to the second to where it lead me to blocking them and leaving their server.  \n\n\nThis next one took place maybe a few days later, which is today. So, basically Lucy said, \"Can i ask you a question, don't get offended.\" I of course said yes, I'm open to any questions but I was kind of worried on what they wanted to ask. Though once they asked this is what they said;  \n\n\n\"How are you trans? In my personal opinion people aren't trans unless they are in some way changing their body to be male/female the opposite of what they actually are. Through hormones, exercise, vitamins whatever. You just don't seem like you're doing that from what I've been assuming.  \nWas just curious if it was a mental thing to you or what. Cause you don't seem to be making your character want to be a female, he is just gay.\"  \n\n\nAfter that, this made me very upset, who wouldn't? Even though I was upset, I tried to explain to them that what they just said was wrong in so many ways. Of course I was upset so, I was cussing and stuff like that, which is rather normal for anyone to be told that \"They're not trans because this person doesn't see it in them.\" I ended telling them that they were transphobic and needed to do more research before assuming things and that they barely even knew me so, they couldn't assume that I'm not transgender anyways. They've also been very toxic IRP and OOC, They put way too much angst and use my character as an object, there was honestly no real roleplay here, because it was mainly just nsfw. Of course I'm comfortable with NSFW but, their main focus was to ruin my character's mental stability and use him for NSFW stuff for her characters.   \n\n\nI've also told her several times to stop forcing my character to be a girl but, she kept trying to do it over and over. Also, before I left the server I told her that trans kids, can't get surgery and can't take testosterone because of their parents and Lucy said \"it was her opinion that she didn't think they were transgender.\"   \n\n\nand yes, I know this is just some online person but, I'm a really sensitive person, and i told them to be at least a bit considerate instead of being inconsiderate and they ended up continuing to be toxic so, today is where I drew the line and this is my story about a bad rp experience and it hurts so much for someone to tell me I'm not transgender because I haven't got surgery yet. I'm trying to get enough money but, I don't have it yet and that's not my fault.   \n\n\nThis actually got very long and I hope some people will respond about this matter, I could really use some positivity.",

We discussed it for several days before taking it to ******* after deciding everything.\n\nWe set the server up, had several channels to it, character bios and face claims, shared a few funny memes and everything was going well. We posted for about a week then she had weather problems, which is fine, I completely get that (snow and ice etc) so her Internet was shocking. I know this is true as I have other partner sin the same region who had similar issues. \n\nShe kept dropping in every other day and I'd see how she was doing and everything was good.\n\nSo, today I've just checked to see how she was doing and **boom** server has gone. I tried sending a message directly to her and it says the account is no longer recognised or I've been blocked. Just sent a message on here so will wait and see but not holding my breath. \n\nMy main point is: I understand people have lives or they may not be happy with the rp but at least let the other party know. Especially when they have turned down other people due to having too much going on. I won't name and shame her as I don't think it's the right thing to do, I just needed to rant and get it off my chest.",

            "selftext": "So this is more of an advice like post. I hope that's okay. I recently responded to a top level post on a forumn rp . They wanted to move to discord to plot. Not a huge fan of discord, but these days you should be so lucky someone wants to plot and bounce ideas. So whatever. I can bend a little. I won't be glued to it all the time, but I can meet chat/messenger players half way. So we talk, no plotting happens, they disappear for three days after I've made the starter post and they've still contributed nothing to plotting. I figure I've been ghosted. Oh well. Not the first time I encounter an rper who had no intent to write. I'm a little mad they dragged me to discord for nothing, but what can you do?\n\nThey reappear apologizing saying RL stuff happened.  I don't think much of it. That happens to all of us. So we get to plotting and halfway through the plotting they are like:\n\n'I kind of what to put this thread on hold, actually and do something else.'\n\nI'm a little taken aback but curious. Maybe the reason it took them so long to respond was because they were struggling with the plot. So I'm like, \"Okay...shoot. What have you got for me?'\n\nSo they want my character with a different character , but this person cannot seem to tack down the smallest of set up details. I mean things that are specific to their character. Things I ought not to have to help them with. Timeline? Eludes them. Canon point? Eludes them. Au ideas?\n\n'Oh I don't really focus on the details.'\n\nYes. I'm beginning to get that picture. But then, why are we plotting?\n\nSo finally, we get the bare bones of something. I nod out because its in the a.m. and I need to sleep and they say they'll get a starter up. I'm like.\n\n'Cool. Tag you in the morning.'\n\nThere's still no starter.\n\nThey don't seem to have ideas , but they don't seem to like mine either. I've met some dud rpers, I have been doing this for years. I have been writing since middle school on my own and collaboratively since my teens. I have never met a person this stressful to plot with. That says a lot. That's not an empty observation.\n\nThey also seem very interested in talking about their rps. Mine and my stuff? Not so much. I'm tempted to just yeet and ghost myself at this point.  Should I just tell them thanks but we aren't compatible? What's the most reasonable way to approach this? Because while this person may be annoying and frustrating, it's not like they were mean to me. They can't form a coherent idea and stick with it. I do hate confrontation, but sometimes you can't avoid it.\n\nI feel like I'm not sure what they are trying to do. Mostly because they keep changing their mind and I'm starting to feel like I'm just having this never reachable carrot dangled in front of me. I'm trying not to be the bad rper. What to do?\n\nEdit: (Even if I do get a reply today?)",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s me, back at ya with more bullshit! But unfortunately it is NOT the Cotton Candy story and for that, I am sorry; I\u2019m actually still uncovering Sawdust facts and details that I forgot or didn\u2019t even know about, and that post was MONTHS ago at this point, never mind trying to recover details about a secondary issue. Anyway, I\u2019m not on about either of them today\u2014no no, this is literally just me having a petty vent because my week is stressful and I need somewhere constructive to put it.\n\n\nSo, recently my friend acquired ownership of the amino roleplay group we\u2019ve been essentially running for the last two years; it\u2019s the same group my Sawdust and Romance posts spawned from, there was a whole to-do with the previous owner and so-such details to work on. It\u2019s squared off, we\u2019re going over the absolute dumpster fire the amino world lore and mechanics had become and patching it from the ground up, that\u2019s all fine and dandy. But I\u2019ve had a general, petty annoyance from almost day 1 of being a leader, and it was the sheer massive amount of \u201cjoin and dash\u201d accounts we had in the group.\n\n\nWhat I mean by that is, originally the group had an open join policy\u2014it was an open group, no applications or leader-locked invites\u2014and the nice part about joining was you would gain a free character slot for a basic creature (it\u2019s a closed species, closed world RP group, so there are rules, traits and abilities that are regulated on the player race, but we aren\u2019t hard asses about \u201cgive me money\u201d stuff so there\u2019s a lot of free chances to get cool skills and rare traits, we just try to keep it somewhat fair to match the original world &amp; species rules and prevent god-moding). That\u2019s fun, right?\n\n\nWell, after getting the ownership we wanted, I went through the member list and made some stats:\n\n\nWe have 102 member accounts as of the 24th of February.\n\n\nOf those, 51 posted absolutely NO content. Nothing. Not even a doodle or a bio for their free character. Some had even gotten actual pre-made designs from the original owner and didn\u2019t do anything with them!\n\n\nThat\u2019s my petty complaint here.\n\n\nWHY THE HELL WOULD YOU JOIN A ROLEPLAY GROUP AND PAY FOR OR ENTER A RAFFLE FOR A CLOSED SPECIES AND THEN SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, BUT NOT LEAVE?? I\u2019m bitching out of tiredness and frustration having realized that not only did we lose over 20 out of 60 chat rooms because of this same logic (made them, then didn\u2019t say a fucking word in them for 1-2 years), but literally half the people that joined our group popped in, sometimes WITH a character sheet and then just dipped out and didn\u2019t bother to leave the group itself. We ended up disabling the profiles that were dead from 2+ years and had absolutely no content at all and have sent notifications to those that have been quiet but still possess some of the original designs to see about removing the species name from them or reminding them that we still exist, but it\u2019s so disheartening to see it.\n\n\nIt\u2019s dumb and no one else probably cares about these kinds of things, but I needed to get it out. If you don\u2019t like the group you\u2019re in, then make sure to actually LEAVE the group instead of leaving a dead account. If you have something involving you in the group lore and species, please do something with it? Maybe? Leave an impact at least! As a prolific world builder, it kills me to be able to remove HALF the member base from the group and see absolutely no conflicts or loss of content because they didn\u2019t put in the effort to try, but also couldn\u2019t be assed to say \u201cnah\u201d and physically leave. It\u2019s like roleplay activity blue balls!\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to me bitch and moan. I\u2019m gonna go eat a pop tart.",

            "selftext": "So I own a small rp server on discord, we had this person join; he seemed super enthusiastic about the story of the rp, made an extremely detailed OC, he went way above and beyond what I require in a submission.\n\nHe started roleplaying with a member of the server and then suddenly stopped replying. I get that, irl things come up, I myself work full time, and a lot of the server\u2019s population are in our 20s either working and/or are college students. So I\u2019m very lax when it comes to activity, I just ask that people communicate if they know they will be gone for a long period of time, and this is clearly stated in the rules and there is a \u201cleave of absence\u201d channel where that communication can happen. I\u2019ve never been told that this is unreasonable and this is actually something me and the long time members came up with together to prevent the rp from dying constantly which is what happened in the past when the server was new.\n\nThe member he was roleplaying with pinged him for a reminder after a week and he said he\u2019d get to writing a reply but didn\u2019t follow through. \n\nAnother week passed. In my activity rules I give people a two week window to reply, a reminder after one week and then a potential to lose their character if it is a main canon important to the plot after the second week. Minor canons and OC\u2019s have more leeway since you can\u2019t really take an OC from someone since they created it but it\u2019s still a rule nonetheless.\nA couple days after the second week I pinged him in the activity check channel and wrote:\n\n\u201chey there! I\u2019m just checking in with you as it\u2019s been a couple weeks since you last replied in your rp. If things are busy irl and you need a break or know you are going to be inactive for a while, please communicate that in the leave of absence channel so you don\u2019t keep those you\u2019re roleplaying with hanging. Thanks! :)\u201d\n\nShortly after I sent that he just left without saying anything. I mean, I know that you don\u2019t have an obligation to say why, but at the same time I still wonder what happened and it is kind of frustrating. Anyways, if you read this, thanks for listening to me ramble, I just felt a need to vent.",

This is a continuation of [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/l5vatq/nsfw_how_i_beat_a_perverted_powergamer_with_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) due to the word limit and reading comfort! It\u2019s been a while, lots of stuff has happened, but the finale of this RP session has finally been put into words. I do still suggest you read set previous parts so you won\u2019t be too confused reading this one. Thanks!)*\n\n\n**[PREVIOUSLY ON A R/BADRPERSTORIES BLOG]**\n\n\n*\u201dLittle did he know though, that his \u201cexhaustion\u201d left his chest completely bare of any protection...\u201d*\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s Xeno-plant: \"...Finish him, my pet, and you will be rewarded with only my finest pleasures~. That only of my kind. Your children will be strong, and any strength you command will come to you with no resistance...\u201d*\n\n\n*\u201d[TSJAK]\u201d*\n\n\n*\u201d... and that soon, a long, thin blade would find itself protruding Drake\u2019s little mechanical ticker, all the way through his metal back.\u201d*\n\n\n**[AND NOW, BACK TO REVVING UP THE LAWNMOWER]**\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n**[thud]**\n\n\nDrake\u2019s OC crashed to the ground, his bright eyes flashing white once, then dimming into a low glow. Nothing but a seemingly lifeless metal vessel remained.\n\n\nTodd\u2019s Xenoplant re-entered the tunnel, pleased with the results of the third act from this fight. For good measure, he stabbed his tail through the poor motionless Quartermaster\u2019s wound, flinging it aside with no care in the world like a discarded doll. Just a double tap in case it wasn\u2019t as dead as he thought.\n\n\nA lot of people in the OOC spectating this fight were quite taken aback by the presumed death of Drake\u2019s Cyborg. Drake\u2019s a really nice guy, one of the oldest members we\u2019ve started to RP with. He\u2019s had \u201cbad\u201d OCs before (of which I\u2019d like to defend that they weren\u2019t as bad as many said, perhaps only lacking a few things but always being stuffed full of charm) but he got better and better amongst friends.\n\n\nHence the end of the Cyborg was quite moving.\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Slav Friend: [The Cyborg] isn\u2019t dead right..? He can\u2019t go out like this!*\n\n\nTodd shapeshifted back into the form of the dead student he initially took the identity of, only his tongues remaining the same as he let the second one droop down and slightly raise upwards as a reminder of his alien species.\n\n\nStanding tall and holding out a heavy hand, he finally uttered as if he were proposing:\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s OC: \u201cNow accept this gift... and become my bride.\"*\n\n\n*... hmmmmmmMMMMMMM...*\n\n\nStep 3. Close the gap, position to kill, \u201cget the girl\u201d.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: [acting] \u201cAh... how sweet of you... but, can\u2019t I get something... bigger, first?*\n\n\nShe said, briefly rubbing her mouth with her sleeve when her back was turned; transforming the rapier back into pen form and getting up-close and personal to the plant Xeno until his chest met hers. Slowly, she twisted his proposing hands and rested them on herself; moving one on her hip, and the other over and past her chest onto her exposed shoulder as if they were going to romantically sway.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cSomething... better~? Something more... \u2018intimate\u2019~? Between just the little two of us..?\u201d*\n\n\nBeing as close to him as she could possibly be, Lich embraced him with her right arm around his waist to keep this lack of distance between them.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: [lying] \u201cYou\u2019ve truly managed to open my eyes, my young master [Student Alias]. I thought I\u2019d closed them for good after my fruitless union with my husband. Who could\u2019ve known that an affair with a student so young would be such a high~?\u201d*\n\n\nResting her own burned hand still holding her pen on his back to sense the gentle drumming of his alien heart, her left hand went to softly grab his upper leg. It kept moving up and up, ticklishly tracing his sensitive spots and maneuvering under his shirt until she reached his chest with a satisfied smile on her face...\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: [suggests] *\u201dCan\u2019t this moment last just a little bit longer~? Have my scandalously crude and passionate way with you when my fantasies of being above you are still a reality~? Before you\u2019ll make me yearn for your way of love on the night we\u2019ll be bound as equals for life~..? Ever since I bumped into you tonight, the question of what your lips taste like when I do finally kiss you has been driving me ever so mad~..!\u201d*\n\n\n... Aaaaaaaand enter narc Agent who\u2019s seeing his smug confidence in Todd\u2019s ability to win failing in the fine print. [=_=]\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Narc Agent: Best that you drain [Drake\u2019s OC] of all his Artron, if he\u2019s truly got parts of a TARDIS for cybernetic enhancements. Only if they\u2019re completely drained of the stuff do they die. Up to [Drake] if they want their pointless OC to die. They\u2019re not used that often, so it wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss. Navy, and by design Lich, would know all of this.*\n\n\nFor a guy who\u2019s supposedly RP\u2019ed for hard cash by the rules since 2012 and always bragged about T1-RM being the only way to win as a pro, he sure likes to help his betting horse illogically Metagame to win via the OOC and condemn \u201cpointless OCs\u201d to mediocrity.\n\n\nWrite a book man. Be smart.\n\n\nImmediately, I notice that Todd might be paranoid about his chances to win as well. Despite typing out his response before the narc Agent entered his reminder, the typing signifier disappeared for a day until a new text from him graced the screen at all.\n\n\n*Because now that he\u2019s probably read back to Lich\u2019s equipment list, he finally noticed the poisonous lipstick due to the kiss now becoming a matter of life or death.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Todd: Do I fall for it and get the art, or do I stay in character and realize that alien's dont know what kisses are...*\n\n\n*... and every OOC spectator disliked that.*\n\n\nMy Slav friend who made the poison for the lipstick nailpolish gave him a *real* scolding.\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Slav Friend: Yeah, sure. A creep who\u2019s species seduces people for a lifetime doesn't know what kisses are. You have a real poor excuse to avoid what Navy prepared. [Xenoplant] was made with the sole purpose of seducing and making people into [frequent dance partners]. How can you hope to seduce someone, when you don't even know how to kiss? I call big BS that you made up, just so you could be the winner. This all just [heccin] confirms that BS\u2019ing to victory is still a thing for you, [Todd]. I hope it won't happen again. Cause it ruins the fun, even for spectators.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Drake: Plus, [Todd\u2019s OC] is said in his wiki to copy the actions of people to better seduce and interact with them. This counts I would think.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Todd: Unless someone wants to say he saw kissing on the* **brief 7 hours** *he's been on [tropical island Venice-Paris town place], I don't think this counts. Kissing isn't detrimental to breeding.*\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Slav Friend: But it is for seducing! And by 7 hours, yes, he could have seen people kissing. Couples kiss in public all the goddamn time.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC me: Especially if you\u2019re Dutch like me, then you peck every stranger you remotely know on the cheek or lips whenever you meet them. You even started off with the disguised [Xenoplant] looking to learn how to romance people.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Fellow Staff: He would be a pretty shitty [fricc] then. \u201cI'll give you da finest of pleasures... and by that I'll just stick my [bratwurst] in you \u2018cause I don't know foreplay\" lmao.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC me: Might I also briefly add, but Lich also constantly gave him a verbal step-by-step wish list on \u201chow to taste lips\u201d multiple times. If he didn\u2019t know about it then, he definitely knows of it now.*\n\n\nPeer pressure, the best thing to happen.\n\n\n**Resume action!**\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s OC: \"... I cannot [dance] with you and accept you as my wife in your current condition.\u201d*\n\n\n*Sigh...*\n\n\n**[tsjack]**\n\n\nTodd\u2019s plant Xeno briefly pushes Lich off\u2019ve him, taking her burned hand and stabbing his second tongue in it to transfer... growth hormones, into her arm as to rapidly heal the burn wound and also heal any of the other cuts that she\u2019d received from Drake\u2019s OC to sell the realism, those that left her with some fabric less.\n\n\n&gt; *Todd\u2019s OC: \u201cI will take you, all that you want... when I\u2019ve completed all your proper alterations.\"*\n\n\n**[tsjack]**\n\n\nTodd\u2019s OC yet again stabs Lich with his second tongue, but now jabbing it in the side of her neck to pump her full of... different... hormones. As in chemicals and hormones in order to begin physically changing her appearance. Enlarging her chest, enlarging her nates\u2014 surely I don\u2019t need to get into the details of this fetish, do I?\n\n\nBasically, just him trying to get some fetish stuff in to rub off whilst he still can before the show is over.\n\n\nWanting to end this overdue B-movie, I have Lich resume her previous action\u2019s position. Right hand with the burned sonic pen behind his back, left hand resting on the pressure points of his chest.\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Todd: ... can\u2019t [Todd\u2019s OC] somehow notice that she has poisonous lipstick..? Smell? Colour?*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Slav Friend: Nope. Odorless, colourless, tasteless. The only way to know is to have always known that she has it, or to take it all in and collapse from it.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Todd: Lich just wiped her lips onto her palm. Hasn\u2019t she just poisoned herself?*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC me: Nope, sleeve. Protective lipgloss layer in between it all. Clear lipgloss at that. It would suck if you constantly needed to reapply the colour of your lipstick, so some girls cover it. From experience, the gloss tends to rub off first. And not much colour goes with it too, which would still land on the clear gloss. Plus her clothes are bloodied as heck so it\u2019s gonna be hard to spot. Lich\u2019s wiki also states that she applied the poisonous lipstick on yet another protective clear gloss, and she previously cracked a pill with the 1-dosage remedy for it a long while back at the begin of her beat. Plus great drug resistance.*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC Todd: Isn\u2019t there another remedy for it somewhere?!*\n\n\n&gt; *OOC me: Currently circulating through her bloodstream? Yes. Not too common elsewhere though since it\u2019s not a common poison, and her blood surely doesn\u2019t contain a big enough dose for you too. Besides, how are you going to drink all her blood to get it if [Todd\u2019s OC] is unable to move after knowing what hit him? Plus, didn\u2019t he want to whoo the lady first and have his way with her~? And you know what happens after you mortally injure a Time Lady...*\n\n\nFool me once, shame on *you.* Fool me twice, shame on *me.* Fool me thrice...\n\n\n*... I posted the Step 3b art as an RP action.* Depicting Lich, kissing a surprised Todd. And behind his back... the sonic pen was lined up with his heart and the secondary heart of Lich, her thumb hovering above the button to *transform* it into the White Artron-tipped rapier.\n\n\n**He. Was. Screwed.**\n\n\n*10 seconds pass.*\n\n\nTodd\u2019s muscles begin to ache. The poison of the lipstick was slowly kicking in.\n\n\n*30 seconds pass.*\n\n\nParalysis. He can\u2019t move an inch. No shapeshifting, no spores, no chemical creation, no regeneration. Nothing. A *State of Grace* effect of the poison shuts down any of his more supernatural abilities.\n\n\n*40 seconds pass.*\n\n\nThe world is spinning around him. His head might be throbbing. He might feel the exponentially growing urge to slowly close his eyes, lay himself to rest from a night of chasing skirts in the comfort of his \u201cbride\u2019s\u201d warm embrace.\n\n\n*And, finally, close around the minute mark...*\n\n\n**[TSJAK-TSJAK]**\n\n\nA thin blade pierces two hearts, one of Todd and one of Lich\u2019s. The guard of the rapier prevents Todd from just stepping back and basking in the nonexistent sunlight because they\u2019re all still underground. Both are skewered on the same metal, whether they like it... or not.\n\n\nMoving her head back from the killer kiss\u2014spitting out a good chunk of long gross hormonal lizard tongue too\u2014it was clear that Lich played him before he could play her.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: [mockingly] \u201cAh~. What a most heart-throbbing kiss, don\u2019t you say? It\u2019s been such a long time since I shared one with a reason. My former husband quite enjoyed them. He was actually quite the romantic, made it easier for me to pull his strings. Sadly, he became a rather sad and useless man when his politics got in the way of my ascension. Even my own children were holding me back. And well\u2014 I suppose you could guess where he ended up in the end...\u201d*\n\n\n**[WHOOSH]**\n\n\nThanks to Lich\u2019s species abilities and titles, the ability to Regenerate from the most terrible wounds sprung into action. Like a mighty Phoenix, she bursted into concentrated flames of pure radioactive gold. Repairing her physicality from Todd\u2019s horrific body alterations, whilst the power set Todd ablaze and utterly destroyed him bit by bit.\n\n\n&gt; *Todd: \u201cY-YOU WENCH! You'll regret it... you'll all regret it!\"*\n\n\n*[\u2022w\u2022] Finally... sweet sweet undefiled victory.*\n\n\n&gt; *Todd: [alien screeching] \u201cMore will come! MAY THE POWER OF MY GODS RENDER YOU USELESS! YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU KILLED\u2014!\u201d*\n\n\nHe gets cut off.\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: [whispers] \u201c[unreadable real Xenoplant name]. It\u2019s a letdown really. Here I thought that I\u2019d caught the one-and-only Ripper, when in fact it was just a weed with the worst cover story I\u2019ve ever heard as a Burner...\u201d*\n\n\n&gt; *[pause]*\n\n\n&gt; *Lich: \u201cWhat is your mythical maternity floozy going to do against the sole inspiration for the Morrigan, Hel and Santa Muerta?\u201d*\n\n\nNaming his species, his slip-up\u2019s, and slowly counting down the exponentially decreasing amount of time he\u2019s got left to live thanks to that eye power of hers, Drake\u2019s eyes relit a brilliant blue glow before miraculously picking himself up from the ground.\n\n\n&gt; *Drake: \u201cYou know, you could have been a tad gentler with that rapier, on my behalf.\u201d\n\n\nBack up all hale and hearty, dusting off his cybernetic parts from rolling around in the dirt, the hole in his chest was beginning to slowly mend itself as it had only damaged a replaceable link to a reserve Artron tank. Hence the spout of radiation when Lich struck him, but ultimately not being fatal.\n\n\nThanking each other for being around that night\u2014and a very rare admission of gratitude regarding Drake\u2019s presence on the Market having saved Lich from a cruel fate\u2014the two of them parted ways as Lich went back to her base of operations and Drake dragged Todd to his office to interrogate him by way of publicly beating the crap outta his every fiber.\n\n\n\u2018Cause ey, he deserves it after none of his previous attacks hit the thing.\n\n\nThe as-good-as-dead Xenoplant, still bewildered from his painful loss, squeals about a whole future Bad RP\u2019er story that deserves a whole blog of it\u2019s own. Still petrified from the poison and forced into enduring a lot of pain from 3rd degree burns... decides to fanboy his last breaths on the planet for a whole paragraph about how much *he* is completely head-over-heels for \u201cbut a lowly human female\u201d for beating him at his own game..?\n\n\nThat he might have fallen in love with... with the woman he tried to [forcefully dance with]..?\n\n\n*[+1 accidental meat shield acquired]*\n\n\nDrake couldn\u2019t care less though, remarking that he picked a stupid disadvantaged fight with someone who isn\u2019t so much \u201chuman\u201d but more \u201cthe physical embodiment of death\u201d thanks to the shared background.\n\n\nAnd that he\u2019s the one the Xeno should be talking sweet about, for he made sure it didn\u2019t burn up like a Christmas turkey being left in the oven by a vengeful vegetarian. Being \u201cthe more merciful embodiment of death\u201d, Drake dragged the burnt rag of a plant Xeno in a net onto the roof.\n\n\nServing up the freak like a tennis ball, Drake went to town on him with a variety of painful punches, kicks, throws and stops, before building up one **massive** punch to send the sucker into the stratosphere and the final frontier to never come down again.\n\n\n**[THE END]**\n\n\n... or at least, the IC version.\n\n\nY\u2019see, after all the memes about the One Kiss Woman were pouring in, I nearly got hit up daily in PM or woke up to the OOC containing... some sanity-questioning things.\n\n\nIt was Todd.\n\n\n[._.] ... telling me how hard his \u201cthing\u201d was the night before, because of all the vital moves my Lich made on his OC to get close and reenact that one 4-step embrace meme from ages ago.\n\n\n... and he\u2019s got an IRL crush on her now.\n\n\n*[o-o] ... and like he was 1 year younger than me, making him 16.*\n\n\n*[pls click](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4wX2xBOuzRg)*\n\n\n\n**Which\u2019ll be left for a short wrap-up story another time because the original One Kiss Woman tale is over and goddamn it requires some screencap diving.**\n\n\nNow sleep tight, arm yourself with a knife and set any plants in a 5m radius on fire. It\u2019s bedtime somewhere around the world and by god it\u2019s been... *WAIT HALF A YEAR?!*\n\n\n*(I need to get faster thumbs...)*\n\n\nBetter be safe than sorry!\n\n\n\u2014 Navy",

Let me introduce you to Subway, a roleplay partner I met a while ago. Subway has been a thorn in my side for hell knows how long, and last evening was finally when I decided to tell her how I felt.\n\nHow I met this person was over this roleplay community I had been a part of for maybe a year beforehand, and Subway decided to message me and asked to rp. Pretty normal, no red flags. I started to suggest a few plots after she asked for my list, but she was so insanely picky that she had decided to pick one herself. Eh, mildly annoying but it's not worth pulling my hair over.\n\nHer OC description was short and bland, but I just decided to deal with it and rp with her because nobody else was answering my requests. Then we start, and it's one liner after one liner. She also asked me if I was there after going idle for a few minutes and asked me to tell her if i'd be gone for more than 30 minutes.\n\nAfter a few days of this I went on a few month hiatus, but when I came back SUBWAY WAS STILL THERE. I figured, hey, maybe she got better since I been gone, so I made the mistake of messaging her again. We picked up a roleplay and I was terribly mistaken. She hadn't changed, and she was MORE desperate for me to reply! \n\nWhen I confronted her after a while, I wasn't really the happiest person. I had talked briefly in the past about these issues but this was the final straw. She went on about how I was the \"best rper she's had in a year or two and to please not leave\". The victim isn't a really good approach so I just decided to leave. Was I too harsh?",

But I was curious and wanted to see how this went. \n\nI will call this person E\nE then proceeded to grill me in a series of questions as if I was the one wasting their time, even if they were the ones hitting me up. \n\n\"Are you even literate in RP?\"\nAnd then strange to start. \n\n\" are you even a dog person?\"\n\"Do you judge Ocs?\"\n\" are you fine with smut and gore seperately.?\" \n\nThey then proceeded to continue their elitist snobby ways when asked if I watched anime. Which wasn't a lot save for Shield Hero, Overlord and Madoka magica. Now I want you, reader, to pay  note that this entire time I've been trying to get them to ask what in the hell they wanted for a plot. \n\nE noted I watched Madoka and if i ever watched it before to say i did. Then proceeded to say that was the basis for the plot. Red flags my dudes. If you put two together they asked all those suspicious questions and then wanted to do a Madoka plot... y'know the anime with little magical girls. Yeahhhhh no. \n\nI told them I wasnt comfortable with it. \nE gets huffy, acting like I was wasting their time. (Even though they dodged my questions and was an overall rude C**t the entire time) Says this to me:\n\n-sigh-\nThen my story is pointless\nBye\nGuess you wont try either. \n\nI proceeded to tell them off and blocked them. I vented to the group I discovered E and I shared and led me to Share the messages to the mods who have since told me that they're keeping an eye out for E. \nThey didn't outright state the plot but if you wanna question if I'm gonna judge you for smut and Gore and then do a Madoka plot. Yeah that's some obvious red flags.  \nOverall, did they honestly think acting like a creepy rude brat was going to get them anywhere?",

You know it's an rp site, yes? Why aren't you there to write then? \n\nTo reiterate, I don't mind socializing with an rp partner.But I'm not there to primarily socialize with you or hold your hand on how you want to write your character. Primarily, I'm there to rp. Especially if I'm already setting the stage with the starter. \n\nThat's another pet peeve. Have some wants and desires of your own. How can one play a character and have no idea how to even react to or set up a scene with them?\n\nI also don't want to hear about religion or politics in my first conversation with you. I'm not trying to date you. I don't need to know these things. RP is my escapism. It's one thing if we have been writing a good while and have established a comfortable relationship/friendship, but oversharing personal or sensitive topics on day one (whilst refusing to write) is a fast track way to ensure that I actually end up ghosting you.\n\nI know COVID has screwed a lot of us over. A lot of us are caged in our houses practically and it sucks. But that's not an excuse to forget common courtesy and common sense. That's not an excuse to lure someone in talking to you on the premise you share a hobby with them only for them to find out you had no intention of ever of participating in said hobby. It's so demoralizing.",

But not a single person has reached out to me and I worry that I'm too jaded for anyone to wanna write with me? When I look at other people's adverts for 1x1 roleplay, there's a lot of people asking for smut and faceclaims and those are the two major things thay I do not want out of a roleplay. \n\nMaybe it's just hard to find partners when I'm asking for people above twenty-one, but listen, I'm a thirty year old dude and I just don't feel comfortable writing with minors. I really feel like I'm screaming get off my lawn you damned kids, but what someone around eighteen wants from rp is much different than what an adult wants. I am just here to write with a decent partner who don't care about smut or faceclaims, but where did they go? I remember when posting an ad meant waking up to lots of new friend requests and people wanting to RP with me, but when there's radio silence for days, I just wanna pull back my ad and not bother at all.\n\nYeah, this isn't really a bad story about anything, but more a rant.
