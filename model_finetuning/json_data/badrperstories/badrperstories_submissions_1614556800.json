            "selftext": "This list includes some types of bad-roleplaying behavior I have encountered in group roleplays. This is not about the mods of group roleplays, just the members. Do you have any types you want to add or find especially annoying?\n\n**The ship chasers**\n\nNearly everyone knows them. While other people are discussing the plot details of the roleplay or asking about the lore, their first question is 'What about the pairings, when can I decide who gets to be my love interest?' Even with story-driven roleplays, they often judge the other writers' characters solely based on their faceclaims and how attractive they are.\n\nOften, these leads to very uncomfortable situations OOC, when they contact someone without reading the character profile with 'Hey, love your character! Are you interested in romance with my character?' Now, some poor person has to explain to them that according to their character profile, the character is already happily married for 10 years, gay (or hetero if their character is gay) or simply not interested in romance at the moment for different reasons.\n\nMany times, this ends up with the ship chaser trying to convince them to chance some core aspect of their character, and then throwing a temper tantrum and ranting about 'compromises' when they get told that this will never happen.\n\nAnother subtype of this bad roleplayer is the smut chaser.\n\n**The person who did not notice that this isn't an anime roleplay**\n\nThis person has not noticed that this is a more 'realistic' group roleplay, which means that they include obvious anime stereotypes like nosebleeds every time someone gets horny, characters who are so clumsy that they can barely function in their daily life and male characters who seem to always fall in a way that leads them to accidently touch some female characters boobs, for example.\n\nWhile this can work in an anime based roleplay, it often seems veeery out of place in a realistic roleplay, especially if it happens all the time. Often, a lot of the other writers don't even watch anime and therefore constantly wonder why their writing counterpart acts so weird. Likewise, the anime writer ist often dissatisfied with the lack of action and over the top drama.\n\nThis can also happen the other way around, someone who joins an anime inspired roleplay and then constantly complains about stuff that is common in many animes or flat out says how much they hate anime all the time and how they want to change the entire roleplay to be more 'realistic'.\n\nJust choose a roleplay that fits your preferences!\n\n**The critic**\n\nThis leads me to a different type...the person who joins a roleplay even though they know that it doesn't fit their preferences, complains, and expects everyone there to cater to their needs. For example a smut roleplayer who joins a roleplay server which does not allow explicit sex scenes because there are underage members, just to complain how childish that is and that a roleplay without smut isn't worth the effort.\n\nOr someone looking for explicit gore or horror in group roleplay which is more fluff than anything, and then goes on a rant on how the real world isn't just unicorn and rainbows, so they should be allowed to include it.\n\nYes, the real world isn't just pretty, but...roleplays are fictional, and roleplays do not have to include everything that exists in the real world. This also goes the other way around, if you join a group roleplay were smut is allowed, don't constantly complain if other people are writing it.\n\nNot to mention all the people who join a group roleplay just to protest against every aspect of the rules and the lore of the roleplay. If you don't find anything about the roleplay appealing, maybe, you should just look for a different roleplay...\n\n**The type that needs instant connections**\n\nThey will approach you regarding your characters, but not in a ship chasing away. Instead, they are looking for a room mate/best friend or beloved family member for their character. Often, their character are fairly well thought out, so you agree.\n\nAfter having planned everything, they either: 1. disappear from the roleplaying group without a word after deleting every trace that their character ever existed or 2. tell you that they have lost interest because they noticed that the group roleplay isn't for them, and that they wish you luck.\n\nThis isn't a problem in itself, losing interest is okay, it happens. But I met a bunch of these people who always immediately tried to contact other writers for planning relationships, and always inevitably left the server because they noticed that some minor details doesn't fit their preferred way of roleplaying.\n\nAlternatively, these people want to be mods or apply for very important characters (for example the leader of an evil kingdom), but than disappear forever after two weeks.\n\nIf you make other people's character dependent on your characters in a way, the first step should be reading all of the information about the group roleplay and thinking long and hard about if this is really something you want to write longterm or not!\n\n**The person who only seems to exist OOC**\n\nThis person is basically never actually roleplaying. If they even make a character profile, it is never used and they don't seem to be actively searching for writing partners. They only write OOC, and oh boy, the stuff they share is often completely inappropriate. Often, it seems like all they do is vent, constantly. Their family sucks, their friends are complete garbage, all the roleplayers they meet are assholes... if you try to give them advice, they react annoyed, because what do you know about their life?\n\nAnother subtype of this is the person who always just seems to be on the hunt for in real life friendships (or even romantic relationships). This person is often super friendly...and super interested in certain members personal lives. Unfortunately, they also seem to rarely get the hint if other members are solely interested in roleplaying and not really interested in sharing intimate details about their personal lives.",

            "selftext": "While I work on my own little world that I would like to see realized as an RP setting someday, I well, have to settle for what's available online. Medieval Fantasy being the desired genre ... oh boy. Look I adore Tolkien, DnD, and everything they have done for the genre. But people seem so deadset on the faux Anglo setting, that anything outside of it \"just wouldn't fit\" I get told a lot. Yes. We have green people with tusks who are absolute hulks, giant lizards that can weave magic as competently as they barf flames, barefoot hippie Elves tied to natural Gods, and a myriad of other things. But as soon as someone wants to play a character that may be from (In my case) an African coded nation, then no, that won't work. Regardless of how appropriate they align with any internal systems, balancing, how miniscule you make their place of origin seem to the established kingdoms, etc etc. (All Japanese esque OCs get a pass though for some odd reason, I wonder why.) \n\nThe irony? I keep getting this from servers that claim they're so \"Welcoming to new perspectives and different walks of life\" but when someone actually presents something different they'll turn it down. You'll probably get some bull about lore reasons even though it's described that the players can literally make the lore in a lot of these places, the character is just not practical because every character needs to be an op demigod amirite? Character development is for losers. Or some other excuse that doesn't make a lick of sense. Shame on you as a creative for trying to inject your creativity into a server that asks for it! Like why even try to claim anything as fantasy when it's just the same thing over and over? Where's the fantasy of it? Don't even get me started on other genres like some modern SOL rps I've joined set in areas with heavy POC populations. (That's a story for another time.)",

My problem is that all of my replies are either 1 paragraph, 2 to 7 paragraphs, or entire novels depending on the situation, context, how I'm feeling at the moment, etc and I feel like that's an issue. My starters are usually very long and for the first few days, my replies can be as well but as it goes on or if less stuff is happening, I'm popping out 2-4 paragraphs even though I'm trying to match my partner's maybe 5 paragraph answers \n\nSometimes I'm writing a reply and it looks really good, it adds to the story, it gives my partner something to answer, but it isn't that long so I just look at it and I'm thinking \"Well.. what the hell am I supposed to add to this? 5 paragraphs of them sipping coffee or breathing?\" \n\nI don't know if I'm the only one with this issue but I feel like it makes me undesirable as a writing partner",

            "selftext": "So to start, I have been roleplaying for about 6 or 7 years. I have developed new writing styles over the years and I\u2019m so happy I have changed methods sometimes to better my writing. When I role play, I love going in depth as one does. I like all the exciting adventures and scenes that are being written up, it gives me motivation to create. Always has. I am terrified when it comes to confrontation, did I mention that?\n\nI have come across few partners that get attached to my characters, and just my characters and get extremely hurt when they talk to me outside of role play. They see that I am a bit different than my character, truly. They are hurt that I do not wish to become sexual with them outside of the role play, that I am sort of kept to myself and keep my life a bit on the down low rather than share EVERYTHING. \n\nThis partner in particular has been around for a few years. Let\u2019s name him Fred. Fred has his moments of asking me to call him or sext him. I have told him that I do not feel comfortable with those things with role play partners, it\u2019s a whole differently ball game. I will care for you as my friend, not as your character. He recently ghosted me, which is 100% fine. Most male partners do when they find a girlfriend, and I get happy for them! They have somebody. That\u2019s what matters, as long as they aren\u2019t hurting them, I am happy for them. \n\nFred comes back a bit ago, saying he got a girlfriend and shows off pictures of her (some scandalous, some quite innocent). I tell him that it\u2019s great he found somebody. Few days later, he messages saying they broke up because she was having some problems with herself. I respect both of them, I don\u2019t know her personally so I tell him I wish she feels better. He replies, \u201cYeah it\u2019s whatever. What do you want to role play?\u201d Never once did I tell him I was up for it, I was actually at work and in a bad spot in my personal life. I told him, \u201cI actually have a lot on my plate right now, Fred.. Between work and home stuff, I\u2019ve lost my creative spark and put playing on hold.\u201d \n\nHe gets upset, tried calling me on my discord repeatedly. I tell him to stop, I was at work, I wouldn\u2019t answer. He finally replies, \u201cWell, I just miss our scenes. The way you write about...\u201d and discusses sexual scenes we had done in the past (and by the past, I mean a year ago. We barely talked and role played). I finally say, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you wanted to RP, we haven\u2019t done so in a while.\u201d Fred ignores this, and tells his scene and waits for me to reply. I explain my job is more important right now, and it\u2019s my top priority along. \n\nHe begins asking where I work, what time I\u2019ll be off so we can RP, giving off ideas and telling me what my character will be wearing. \n\nSo my question is.. \n\nHow do I tell a grown man that I don\u2019t like this treatment and I wish to stop talking to him if he continues to treat me like this? I know I seem like a scaredy cat, but he has never gotten so invasive before until now.",

            "selftext": "When the writing is very good but your partner\u2019s OOC baggage sort of like kills your mood to write.  I want to but other things they\u2019re doing is making it hard to feel motivated. I\u2019m mostly a tumblr writer and recently jumped into like larger more social writing servers. Through one of these servers, I\u2019ve been writing with a new partner for maybe 4 months now and in that time I\u2019ve experienced these weird problems: \n\nThey expect that I respond to their posts first. They need confirmation that they are my \u201cfavorite\u201d. They have multiple storylines with the their OC but are offended when I open another SL with the OC I use in our RP. They kind of treat it like I am \u201ccheating\u201d.  They are negative about other writers that I\u2019ve written with and act insecure or jealous when I write with others. They have passive aggressive conversations when I do pursue another RP partner for a second or third SL. They point out how often I\u2019m  posting and sort of like keep track even though I am clear about how frequently I can write. They have started arguments when I have praised other writers. They see me wanting to write with others as some like reflection that they\u2019re not enough for me even though they actually have several other writing partners themselves, so I don\u2019t really get what the problem is. There is a lot more that I don\u2019t even know how to really put into words atm.\n\nLONG STORY SHORT I\u2019ve been thinking of yeeting the RP but Idk what to say bc it has nothing to do with the writing. I am really bad with confrontation and usually accommodate to make others happy. I\u2019m also actually pretty bummed to stop the writing. Confused and unmotivated :|",
