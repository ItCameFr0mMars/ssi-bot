The characters felt natural, they butted heads occasionally but they felt like real people with a real friendship. The kind of friendship that you'd kill for in real life. The responses were very literate and came frequently, at their peak they came every day, sometimes a few a day. Safe to say this was my favourite roleplay I've ever done . Unfortunately one day, mid way through the roleplay, the response just never came. No good ending point, no goodbyes, just silence. I see them online from time to time and try to reach out occasionally but a response has yet to come. I'm admittedly a little clingy with my roleplay partners but I'm oddly heartbroken of this lost endeavour. I get that people have lives outside of roleplay but it's been over a month. I don't want it to end like this. I'm scared that I'll never find a roleplay partner like that again. I'm very bummed out about it.",

I\u2019m coming to you with a recent situation that\u2019s happened to me and I\u2019m just so creeped out, I needed to vent about it. Thank you for listening.\n\nAnyway, I posted an advertisement looking for a specific roleplay and I got a few hits. One was from a girl. I\u2019ll call her Cindy to hide her true identity. Cindy and I started to hash out some details over Discord after we agreed to start a roleplay together. She seemed nice, friendly, outgoing -- all things I like in a partner because it makes me feel like we\u2019d be a good fit for writing. \n\nShe went to work shortly after and we texted back and forth. Nothing too big; we just talked about the roleplay and our characters (which reminds me -- I\u2019ll post something at the end about the artwork for her OCs). After a while, I went through some drama and Cindy was nice enough to ask if I wanted to call and vent to her once she was home from work. I thanked her, as it was some yucky stuff that happened to me, but anyway! Got on the call, and she never once asked about how I was, or let me talk. She just went on and on about her ex-boyfriend, not being able to find friends on Reddit, and her characters. I let her talk, but I felt a bit sided since she suggested I call her and vent. I\u2019m not a selfish person though, and tried to help her with her issues. \n\nWhat really got me and this was just... wow-- was after about three days of talking, Cindy all of a sudden asks me such a shocking question that made me entirely too uncomfortable. She asked me to be her girlfriend. I was in shock. I know nothing about her -- I don\u2019t even know her name, and she knows nothing about me. Mind you, she\u2019s four years older than me as well and I felt like this was totally out of line, since we were supposed to be roleplaying. I don\u2019t mind befriending partners, but dating them after knowing them for such a short time? No. \n\nI told her I had a boyfriend, which I do, and she tried to change it to, \u201cwell I meant more of like AFTER we got to know each other, we could date.\u201d I-- I was like??? That doesn\u2019t change anything? I don\u2019t know. Maybe this isn\u2019t so bad as I think it is, but it made me waaay too awkward to the point where I thanked her for contacting me, but I won\u2019t be moving on with roleplaying.\n\nBonus: Cindy showed me some artwork of her character, which were all beautiful drawings! I was enthralled and praised her, but as she continued to show me, I noticed that her art style was vastly different than the first one she showed, so I did some digging and found out that she was lying about drawing these. She actually commissioned the artists. I managed to hunt down the artists on Deviantart and will be letting them know about that.",

What makes you think that is welcome and not a creepy ass thing to do?\n\nWhy are you showing me your penis?  I do not want it.  No one does.\n\nWhy are you asking me to prove I'm a woman over discord chat?  First off, I never claimed to be a woman, only that my character is one.  There would be no lie there if I wasn't one.  Second, no.  I don't care how innocent you claim this is (maybe you've even convinced yourself it is), but I have been here many times before.  It will not end well.\n\nWhy are you asking me if I'm physically built like my character?  Dude.  Just no.  Stop.  Bad.\n\nWhy do you not think I'm going to check your post history?  Yes, your plot would be very cute and wholesome if you weren't posting the same idea with slightly different wording in nsfw subs.

            "selftext": "I'm in a RP Server on Discord- It's amazing! Fun people that work with each other to further the lore and the Mods/Admin/Owner are active and great!  \n\n\nA few weeks after I had joined, we got this person come in I'll call.... Shawn, I guess. Shawn didn't really use capitals or full sentences when he talked to everyone out of RP but that was fine, it was just causal fun chats no big deal.   \n\n\nBut when I went to go plan an RP with someone I have world lore built with, they wanted to come in and we both said sure. Shawn was a one-liner rper and didn't give himself the server role. It was disheartening and honestly made me a little sad that I couldn't properly get out my ideas- The introduction of my newest character (The RP I was in with him) felt passive aggressive and not at all what I wanted it to be but I have to remember that that's ok, we all have different Ideas.  \n\n\nHowever, I'm now super hesitant to RP with Shawn anymore, it's weird because I started getting back into rp and now I'm not sure I want to anymore. I have this whole event going on with a Civil/World war on my planet and Shawn doesn't only RP in one liners, his character is super OP and he doesn't really seem to do anything when people point it out as being so?  \n\n\nMaybe I'm over analyzing but, geez.",

            "selftext": "My story today surrounds an SDS server that I joined about three days ago. I spent a lot of time and effort making my characters, and I spent even more time waiting for them to be *approved.* While I don't have any issues with that, life and all, there was a certain nail in the coffin that made it... impossible to stay there. It's a funny story, involving childishness and a lack of ability to take any form of criticism or feedback without getting offended and banning you.\n\n**Below, I have taken the liberty to not censor my own name. I hope this post is found and that the people who banned me are inherently ashamed of their behaviour and learn how to do better. \\[ My last words before being banned: \"I just want to see the server do better.\" \\] Couldn't catch them because I felt that was the direction it was going in since I stopped catering to their more sensitive natures.**\n\nEssentially, this starts with an innate racial ability. In canon, basically, the angels have an ability known as Ark. Because I did not put Ark on my sheet, despite figuring that because it was an Archangel, it would have **the basic racial ability that the race is known for,** I decided to go ahead and ask after if I needed to put it on my sheet, having been more used to servers that don't break canon.\n\nYou see, they don't have any information labelled on the differences from canon in their entire server. I've read it over and over again, **\\[ as disorganized as it was, yes, I will shamelessly call them out for being terribly disorganized \\]**, and there was never any info whatsoever around archangels not having ark / this not being the norm. Note that I am typically a very agreeable, quiet person. Generally, I don't like causing issues. \n\nHowever, I brought this up **politely,** and someone else **seconded** that it made no sense, especially for an archangel, not to have Ark. \n\n**\"If you don't like the way this server works, then maybe it's not for you.\"**\n\n**The single-handedly most d-i-s-g-u-s-t-i-n-g response any staff or owner can give. Why? It shows you do not care about anyone's opinion but your own, you hold little to no value in your community and you have an inability to explain why things are the way they are. If they had given me an explanation regarding why this decision was made and better yet,** ***labelled*** **it somewhere, making it information anyone can access, then I wouldn't have had to get a bit more stern.** \n\nBelow is the following conversation I had in the server after they told me that the server wasn't for me if I didn't agree with them. This was also taken 0.5 seconds before I was banned. So, this server has an intolerance of criticism. There were a total of three red flags previously that I ignored before because I actually found the people within it *great.* The staff? Not so much. \\[ Note: Some staff members are great, some aren't. \\] \n\n1. **Red flag #1:** I made a suggestion regarding organization and roles because it can be a bit overwhelming for someone like me \\[ being that I have a mix of mental disabilities that we aren't going to get into \\] to go through, and confusing. I don't mind that they didn't take it, although the response was, **\"We like the server as it is, we don't want to change anything.\"** Alternatively worded, a better response would be, **\"Thank you for the suggestion, but we don't see a reason to change it as of right now. The rest of the members seem to be satisfied with the server, so we're going to leave this be until we get more voices of dissonance.\"** &lt; That. That is the way you are **supposed** to respond, rather than an informal and rather short answer to a list of suggestions that I gave, therefore not respecting my effort whatsoever.\n2. **Red flag #2:** A *bit* on the clique-y side, and I'm sure everyone knows that it can feel a bit difficult to get into it when everyone seems like they're in a constant circle that you're out of, but I still tried regardless. I was polite, I was kind, and I was active. Even as I was providing criticism, instead of informing me why I was banned, they were in a voice chat, probably talking to each other about it, and not talking to me- when they should have been, since I was a member of the community as well.\n3. **Red flag #3: \"I think your character would be better if...\"** We all have this kind of experience. Someone telling us how they think our characters would be better when they haven't even read the bio. The owner immediately assumed my character was a carbon copy of a canon character by reading the first three lines of the bio alone. That's not how you're supposed to approve characters. I understand that you're busy, but delegate the task to someone else if you don't have the time to read.\n\nDear Seven Deadly Sins server. With all of this to reflect upon, I give you a meager 0.1/10. Why? You don't really deserve a 0.1. The sole reason is a member coming to check up on me after I was unfairly banned. But even then, they deserve a 10/10 for what they've done, so I'm dropping your rating to 0.0. It's honestly no way to run a server.\n\n**As I said before you banned me \\[ Again, unfairly. \\] \"Please. Do better.\" Worse than trying to eat a McDonald's big mac without the bun. If you know how messy a big mac is, then that's bad. That's...** ***really, really, bad.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v7pr79xnvxl61.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0424a9cc6adcaf80a94ed27de2b9a1430e68e8d",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is something everyone has noticed or if I just play enough M characters (22F) but it is really hard to find a GM or writing partner who doesn\u2019t have some aversion to playing the same sex. Even in a SFW setting, they just... don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m not about to push a writing partner to play as someone they don\u2019t, but when a large majority of writers on Reddit are men, I get tired of playing with the same cookie cutter player. 6 foot +, strong, dominant and you get the point. It makes it really difficult to want to play as something I\u2019m not, like any M character off the top of your head; they just won\u2019t because they don\u2019t know or want to play as a female character. \n\nI\u2019ve asked around about this too, and gotten responses that range from \u201cI don\u2019t get turned on from playing a woman getting plowed, I can\u2019t touch that way\u201d to \u201cI want to play someone who much more resembles myself\u201d \n\nI can understand both sides of the question (I wouldn\u2019t exactly be touching during a heavy scene, clouds my ability too much. I\u2019d much rather read it after if I was planning on it) and it\u2019s all fair to not want to play the opposite sex, but just so many people are hardcore against it and it makes me feel a bit sad. There\u2019s so much potential, so much to learn, or even to expand what you\u2019re good at writing. Hell, when I play as M, I even have this trick when it comes to more adult scenarios: if I\u2019m playing as an M, and let\u2019s say I really like when a man uses his hands a certain way, nothing is then stopping me from doing what I really like I\u2019m that scene. If you\u2019re a guy and really like girls who wear certain clothes: you can make them wear them, they\u2019re your character after all. \n\nAm I crazy? Obviously I\u2019m not about to force someone to play someone they don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s just so common! Maybe 1 in 30 writing partners are even open to LETTING me play M /: thoughts?",

I told them please send me one message at a time. He didn\u2019t stop. Called me a dufus. Well, I told him never mind. He\u2019s crossed too many boundaries with just 10 minutes of talking to him. A.

Well, he gets pissy and says I should put that in the idea starter thing unless people will just do this. \n\nAm I wrong for being pissed?

Yet. I come back, and try to get into things, only to be ghosted \u2014 usually in the discussion phrase, when we've only scratched at the surface of potential plots. Or, they let the roleplay get rolling, and try to confuse the roleplay for irl \u2014 which is creepy, and uh.. degenerative. \n\n\nI can't be the only person noticing an influx of fuckery, can I? ,_, \n\n\nKind of a short vent, but hey!

A few times I confronted people about this and asked them to start helping out more.  They did, for a few posts, but always reverted back to being passive.\n\nI recently had an experience where I was describing the setting and handling multiple NPCs while my partner was only handling their own character's inner thoughts and one sentence of dialogue in each post.  Rather than talk to them about it, I just ended the RP.  I feel tired and jaded.. I had already wasted my effort on an intro post and several other posts.  Would it have been worth my while to spend effort on even more posts hoping they'd improve?  It really sucks because their writing was decent and they seemed active.\n\nDid I do the right thing?

One time during a Rp he did a flash back kind of thing, but he wanted me to be the person it revolves around, I told him that I couldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t know what the story for it is, he got mad, yelled at me and unfriended me for at least two days...\n\nI told him I no longer enjoy Rping with him and unfriend him, he got mad and leaves again so I decided to post this, huh sadly I won\u2019t let myself post his @ but if your reading this I\u2019m sure you know who you are \n\nSo if your that person, fuck you dude, ain\u2019t no one got the patience to deal with your immature and explosive ass.",

            "selftext": "(2010\u20132015) My character was dating someone on Facebook RP and the lady behind the screen wanted to date for real. At first, I was completely unsure about it and some of my RP friends told me it wasn\u2019t a good idea, that she\u2019s crazy and unstable.. but after 1 year of being close to her, I got real feelings and decided to give this women a chance. We had our characters paired on Tumblr, Twitter, and facebook.. Facebook was our main place of roleplaying. Her main RP Was Mia Rinaldi from the Vampire Academy Series. We would talk about our real lives and tell each other about what was going on, our parents, siblings, where we were born, where we grew up and ect. We had each others login passwords and emails. We sent each other gifts in real life, ect. \n\nI left roleplay for a full 1 year because  there was way too much OOC drama and it was affecting my mental health.. and mental health should come before anything else. There was people on FB RP that were cyberbullying me and reporting my RP Profiles like crazy, to the point where I lost interest in RP. The person who played my RP Partner told me she knew it was some of her friends doing the reporting but for some reason, she refused to block them. Her character kept cheating on my character and it wasn\u2019t a planned storyline. \n\nLater on, I found out she lied about her real life relationship status (she was married the entire time!), she lied about her parents, grandpa, half brothers, uncles, her last name and several other serious things. She made up ALOT of stories about her real life. The only stuff I know she was honest about is her first name and her age. She was definitely cheating on her real life husband with me because she was sending me nude photos and videos of her real life self, she was sexting me, she was talking about buying a house with me, traveling the world together, getting married and having kids in real life, ect. She claimed that her mom was married x3 times, she claimed that her bio dad is American and she immigrated to America to be with her bio dad and stepmom because she wanted to escape from her bio mom. I found out the step mom and bio dad are actually her real life husbands parents, the pictures she showed me of step mom, bio dad, grandpa, half siblings.. those were all her husbands family. If I had known she was lying about her real life, I would\u2019ve put a stop to all of this quickly. She had to of been aware that what she was doing was wrong, cruel AND crazy because she started doing this in her late 20s. At that age, she should\u2019ve knew better.\n\nTo add to this, I was puzzled that she would lie about her real life because I seen how she reacted to a few people she was close to that faked their real lives.  I recently tried to confront her about her horrible lies, but she wouldn\u2019t own up to anything she did. It\u2019s like she has no guilt and remorse. \n\n\u00a0I was really stupid for ignoring the Red flags that were everywhere about this person and I regret getting involved with her. I remember most days she would blow up my notifications while I was at work in real life, the messages would include her accusing me of cheating and long rants about it, her calling me names and saying I don\u2019t love her, ect. It was nuts! She even did this after I told her I was sick. This went on and on. I kept telling her that she needs to get help because she is overly insecure, clingy and has trust issues. All she would do is agree about it and said other people called her out on this very same behavior, she never got help for it though. I have no idea why I put up with this for so long but I\u2019m proud of myself for leaving this person because who knows what would of happened if this relationship continued on. I doubt she was ever going to tell the truth about her real life to me.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n Did anyone else experience something like this? You can message or chat me here if you\u2019d like to talk about it. In some ways, it would be nice to know I\u2019m not the only one who had this kind of RP Experience.\u00a0Please don't judge me \ud83d\ude13",

So many times, I will lose interest in an rp, through no fault of the partner (or not, sometimes it is something they did) and I just have had a really hard time explaining that openly. Usually it\u2019s when my depression really hits me hard and I\u2019ve lost interest in everything all at once. Sometimes it can just be anxiety about the subject matter or a turn the rp has taken.\n\nI usually make an excuse after going dark for several days and then I disappear. I will say, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually gone AWOL with no explanation. But it usually takes a LOT of prodding from my RP partners before I decide, \u201cOkay, I owe them an explanation.\u201d\n\nAnd my explanations are flimsy at best and sometimes they\u2019ve been outright lies because I\u2019m ashamed that my mental health gets in the way of what could be great stories. \n\nWhat makes it really hard are the well-meaning people that are like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay! Go at your own pace! I\u2019ll wait!\u201d And many times that\u2019s when I truly ghost because I can\u2019t bring myself to reiterate \u201cI\u2019m done with this rp and I\u2019m not coming back to it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been honest enough with myself that I typically don\u2019t RP anymore. Because I know I\u2019m unreliable for long periods of time. Instead I write my own stories on DA and offer commissions (and even there I take long sabbaticals away from writing). I would love to do short term collaborations in the future but nothing that requires me to develop a long term partnership with someone.\n\nBecause in the end, I\u2019m always going to be a ghost. And if you are one of the people I\u2019ve ghosted in the past, this is my apology. I\u2019m really sorry.",

It's exhausting, tiring, and tedious.\n\nMaybe as I'm getting older, I realize I could spend this time put into doing something else, like working more on my own personal writing projects, putting effort into something I can be happier with and get results out of or feel satisfied with.\n\nI've also realized that roleplaying, just in general, is a little stressful for me. I ended up taking a break from roleplay for a few months last year and I noticed an immense change in my personal wellbeing. I didn't worry about others getting upset if I didn't reply within a certain amount of time, I didn't get frustrated with partners ghosting, I didn't worry about what anyone thought of my writing, I didn't have to be wary of clingy people or nitpickers or creeps (all of who kill my muse to write).\n\nI don't know yet if I'll actually step away from roleplay permanently, but I'm considering it.\n\nI'm just wondering, has anyone else been here?

            "selftext": "I don't know a better sub to ask for RP advice in. I was debating /r/writing but I was unsure.\n\nSo, I don't know how to add length to my posts. Since I do my RP on Discord, a lot of people like to have a paragraph's worth of content per response, and I'm usually capable of producing that. The issue is when the RP starts to go *over* a paragraph's length per response, or when a paragraph simply wouldn't contain all that needs to be said.\n\nI can't muster the enthusiasm to RP above a paragraph's worth of writing. See, I'm not passionate enough about the RPs that I do in order to produce so much content at once. And that applies to every RP, not one. I mainly do this hobby as a way of relaxing.\n\nBut, when the RP goes over a certain length, I **can't** relax. I feel like I'm doing my partner a disservice if I keep typing a paragraph while they do two or three. **Quite honestly, a lot of times, I don't even want to type a paragraph; I want to leave two lines.** \n\nSo I end up adding a lot of fluff to my responses. A lot.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I should go about this?",

            "selftext": "This is one of my main problems with roleplay searches right now, and it is starting to annoy me. I always read a lot about people that end up with people not writing enough, or people replying with one liners, but I rarely encountered that problem.\n\nMy problem is literate roleplayers contacting me, ignoring my length requirements and then acting like they are somehow doing me a favour by still wanting to roleplay with me when I point this out. This happens to me again and again with literate roleplayers.\n\nI make it clear in my requirements that my replies are between 350-800 words, and that I do not want to write with someone that writes much more than I do. If people write between 500-1000 that is still fine, however, +2000 in every reply is definitely to much for me, and I mention this multiple times in my ad. \n\nI know that some people prefer these kind of replies, but it honestly is not much fun for me. I feel like I have to absorb so much information, it sometimes feels a bit...weird (why is your character thinking at length about some unrelated incident with completely different people while our characters are fighting?), and many people write so much especially during arguments between characters that my character can barely react and it seems like he is just standing there saying nothing while being insulted for three pages.\n\n Even with the best writers, I find myself unable to enjoy it, because I often feel like I am reading a novel and I would love more interaction. To each their own, so I make it clear in my preferences.\n\nBut so many literate writers contact me, and completely ignore this. Then, they will write me 'haha my starter got a little out of hand, I am already at 2500 words.' and I am like...what? However, with a starter, I kind of understand it. So I reply, and after a bit of writing I realize that it will be like this, forever. They just ignored that part of my requirement.\n\nIf I point it out, they act like I am trying to micromanage everything, they can't change their writing style, and my only question is 'why did you apply for my roleplay search then?' Most of the time, they even try to make me feel like I am not a good writer, like them, and complain to me about how hard it is to find partners with their own requirements, so we have to compromise now or they will not find anyone for a while.\n\nSometimes, I realize during the planning phase that this part of my search has been ignored (or they forgot it), so I mention my preferences again. But instead of acknowledging it, they reply something like 'Ah, don't worry, I don't mind if you can't match my length. Maybe you can learn to write as much as I do, I believe in you.' or 'haha, don't worry so much! You don't have to interact with my characters all the time, I can write 2000 words just about my character talking to NPCs.'\n\nAnd especially the second thing is the opposite of what I want from a roleplay. But somehow, it is extremely hard to make them see this (without being super rude), because they always assume that I am just shy and not confident enough.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm well aware that RP servers can become toxic pretty quickly, and I usually stay away from them for that reason. However, I came across a listing for one that was based off the Anita Blake fandom. The series itself can be pretty problematic, but the lore is fun so I figured why not? At first, the group seemed really welcoming but it became apparent within a week or two that these people were by far the most abhorrently toxic roleplayers I have ever encountered, and I went from being active in the server to just sticking around to watch how things played out. I swear these people- especially the owner of the server- ticked every single box on the \"What Not to do in Roleplay\" checklist.   \n\n\nGuys, I really, truly wish I was exaggerating, but some things that I saw in the server included:  \n\n\n\\-Players getting banned for being inactive due to getting COVID-19.  \n\\-Players getting banned for being inactive due to their friends passing away in a car accident (yes, seriously. The owner stated that she didn't care and it \"wasn't an excuse to hold up scenes\").  \n\\-Players getting banned for \"having an attitude\" when asking about rules or lore.  \n\\-The owner getting upset and starting fights with players about their characters \"not wanting to ERP with hers\".  \n\\-The owner getting upset about people not liking her selfies.  \n\\-The owner getting upset about people not paying attention to the explicitly erotic cartoons she draws of her characters.  \n\\-Mods openly making fun of player's mental and physical health, as well as their writing style and ideas.  \n\\-A departures channel where everyone was free and often encouraged to make fun of players who left (this is where I witnessed a mod calling a player autistic for joining and leaving a few times).  \n\\-Players were expected to post every few days, but mods were free to ignore scenes for a week or more without being reprimanded.  \n\\-Flip-flopping of the rules depending on how much the server owner liked the individual player. This included character creation and personal storylines.  \n\\-ALL plots and interactions between players must be vetted through the owner. If the owner wasn't involved, it was usually shut down for some rule made up on the spot like \"this isn't logical enough\".   \nGranted, we were playing in a server with lore that included vampires, witches, and werewolves.  \n\\-All main plots revolved around the owner and her characters. Mods were considered to be allowed to contribute, but only if they actively shipped with her characters.  \n\\-If mods or the owner were upset at a player for any reason, you bet that they were hounded and harassed in-character as well.   \n\n\nInevitably, the owner ended up removing around 99% of her entire player base due to one of these reasons and more that I can't even recall off of the top of my head. This lead to her having open temper tantrums in the out of character chat room about inactivity and how no one wanted to \"interact let alone RP with\" her.  I have seen some toxic stuff in roleplay (as I'm sure we all have), but holy moly, this was so completely out of line in so many ways that often times I thought there was no way they were really acting this way and it must be a joke. I can think of some toxic servers, but this one really takes the cake.",

No, I am not going to change my mind because you are 'mature for your age'--saying this is a red flag that you are not, in fact, mature for your age and are likely to continue to push boundaries.  \n\n\nTo add to this, I have no use for minors, don't want to talk to minors, and have an age limit for a reason. I don't write smut, but that doesn't mean I want to associate with literal children. If an adult wants to be close friends with a literal child that's incredibly sus even without their being smut involved.   \n\n\nI just don't get why some people can't accept this and move on.",
