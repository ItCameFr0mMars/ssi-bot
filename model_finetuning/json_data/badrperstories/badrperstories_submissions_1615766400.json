            "selftext": "So for my rp ads as of late ive been posting more general things with how I\u2019m open to both OC universe stuff along with fandom stuff and I\u2019ll list out the fandoms and add that if they want to rp any other fandoms to just ask (with me saying that I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll know it). So naturally I get a lot of messages from people asking if I\u2019ve heard of X game or know X movie and are in that certain fandom. I\u2019ll be honest with them and tell them if I know it or not and everything but then this has happened a strange amount of times when someone will ask me if I know a specific fandom and then when I say no they get annoyed. It bugs me because it\u2019s not like I list X fandom on my list and then they ask and I say I\u2019ve never heard of it, the fandom they\u2019ll ask for is always off the list so it isn\u2019t a guarantee I\u2019ll know it. I\u2019ve had people from certain fandoms ask if I\u2019d be willing to play the game/ watch the series or movie and most of the time I\u2019ll say no just because if I said yes to all of them all of my time would be consumed by watching these play throughs or movies and shows, while yes I realize I might wind up liking them I\u2019d rather watch and play games I enjoy/ want to play or get into. Sorry for rambling but my question is should I stop including for people to ask if I\u2019m in a fandom and just leave a list and that\u2019s that, or should I do something else?",

            "selftext": "What's the big deal with you being ghosted by your partner? Why should they have to explain themselves for not wanting to roleplay with you? You don't owe each other anything, so why are you taking it so personal? Move on and roleplay with someone else. It really is that simple.\u00a0\n\nFor the record I've been ghosted many of times by my partners and so I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of being ghosted by someone you formed a connection with. Regardless of that connection being a friendship or finding what you assume them to be as your ideal partner - it's still the same scenario.\n\nYes. It's disheartening to wake up one morning and find yourself randomly blocked. What's even more confusing about the situation is you might have been under the impression that everything was going well and you were both invested in the roleplay, only to discover that you were removed from the roleplay and blocked by that said person. Yeah, it hurts like a bitch. Not to mention your left behind wondering when it all went wrong and what you did for them to just fall off the face of the earth?\u00a0\n\nOh. And let's not forget those who don't even bother to remove themselves, or yourself, from the server. Instead of blocking you they just straight up vanish out of thin air and you never hear from them again. Yet they still have the server and you as a friend. What makes this particular situation even worse is that you may find them online and participating iother activities, events and roleplays and yet you've still to receive a word from them. Talk about being an asshole. Am I right, or am I right?\u00a0\n\nMy point is, yes. I get it. I understand why it hurts and why it's disheartening for you to experience this time and time again. I've been through it so I know exactly how it feels. It can cause you to lose interest in the hobby altogether but why? Why do you allow these people to prevent you from enjoying something you love doing? Why are you taking it so personal? Why do they need to explain themselves?\n\nLet them fuck off. Let them fall off the face of the earth. Let them waste somebody else's time. With this hobby you have to have thick skin. Stop having expectations. Go with the flow. Enjoy yourself and the roleplay. Don't seek out reassurance from them potentially ghosting you.\u00a0\n\nGhosting used to hurt me but now I just accept it for what it is and move on. I don't let it get to me. I don't take it personally. For whatever reason it didn't work out and I'm glad I don't have to waste anymore time on them because I don't like people who can't communicate with me and resolve things. So good radiance.\u00a0\n\nDoes anybody else share a similar attitude to me towards those who do ghost their partners? Or am I the odd one out in this scenario? I don't know. Tell me what you think. How do you cope with being ghosting and what's your attitude towards those who do ghost? Any advice?\u00a0",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I made a post a while ago, asking for advice on length and enthusiasm. And, today, I think I realized what the actual issue is. Insecurity.\n\nSo, I was in a group ERP, and we were posting with an unofficial order. Basically, we all knew \"A posts, than B posts, than C posts\", and we kept to that order, unless there was a small response wanted to throw in here or there. And I was becoming increasingly frustrated. These two were writing paragraphs left and right so quickly. And each sentence they wrote was captivating. In comparison, I've been rewriting my posts multiple times in order to try to stay *near* the same level of quality. So I end up taking longer to post, and, when I finally do, my writing is not nearly as good. And I can tell they feel the same, but they're not saying it. My frustration built more and more until, finally, I asked if they could continue the scene without me. Of course, they both asked why and it kinda led to a little back and forth.\n\nThis helped me realize my issue as a RPer.\n\nI don't have fun when I'm writing with people that are better than me when it comes to RP. And that's because I feel like I'm dragging the RP down, that my posts are painful to read compared to theirs. \n\nEvery sentence I write, I reword it ten times over to try to find the best way to structure it. And, before I even have three lines written, I've already spent fifteen minutes on my post and my partners are becoming bored. \n\nI want to improve my writing. I've read a bunch of books and I'm trying to read more novels. But nothing sticks. No matter how much writing I come into contact with, nothing ever remains in my memory.\n\nAnd it's not even that I don't have experience. I've been doing online RP for two whole years now. This has been an issue for those entire two years. Any time I RP with someone who is, clearly, better than me when it comes to writing, I get discouraged.\n\nThis doesn't apply when my partner is clearly worse than me. When someone is not as good as I am, I can relax around them. Because I know, even if I don't try my hardest, they'll still be interested. So I can relax and have fun, and my writing is better for that. \n\nHow backwards is that? When I want my writing to be better, it falters. And when I don't care, it actually comes out decent.\n\n# I'm sorry for the long post.\n\nIf any of you read it, I'd be glad if you could pass down some advice.",

I don't do them, as they make me massively uncomfortable (If you like them cool). So, in all of my roleplay postings, I address this. I explicitly say: I do not do NSFW because it makes me uncomfyyy. I ran into a roleplay where we had a really nice back and forth going. I then realized that my partner was constantly trying to have our partners engage in heavy makeout sessions. (Heavy makeout sessions are fine with me, it is....more than that where I draw the line.)  Each of these sessions would end in NSFW trying to be implemented. To which I say: BACK BACK I SAY! I found myself having to just skip forward a lot in the roleplay because of this. \n\nI was starting to become really annoyed by this repeating pattern and then noticed there were easily 2-3 of these instances a day. I then finally drew the line when my OC just found out her dad was given a month to live. She had her boyfriend take her out for ice cream to get out of the house. On the drive there, her boyfriend started inquiring about my OC's cheer outfit from high school and what he would love for her to do to him in said cheer outfit. Then her boyfriend got a hard-on. ***Normal*** people, last I checked, don't act like that when their SO is upset. I just, I- STAHP! \n\nIf you know your RP partner doesn't like NSFW scenes, don't try to keep implementing them! It isn't funny, it never comes off as realistic and it isn't fun for them! For all you know, it could be triggering for them.  I ended up blocking them and deleting the server then blocking them on Reddit. I will not give that the time of day. I didn't even say goodbye, I just kinda had enough of it. Sorry, not sorry.",

            "selftext": "So I want to preface this by saying I'm new to the app/this subreddit and I have many stories to tell. This is just a few that really stuck out to me:\n\n-To start I had a serious partner that I was very close to. We were on and off for about two years as we would occasionally clash OOC and then end up crawling back. Over the course of one of our breaks, I had checked in on the app we originally met on and had a message from them. Something along the lines of \"Hey I've been bored lately, are you up to roleplay?\" I felt like that's all I was good for anymore. After all the BS we went through together and I put up with from them, my existence was solely for roleplay. That hurt.\n\n-I am not too picky on line requirements. I generally give what I get unless I was recently bit by the inspiration bug and can spout out multiple paragraphs as a single reply. HOWEVER, I do request at least one full sentence. Someone had the audacity to give me \"he smiled\" as a reply. That's it.\n\n-I've had people ghost me. Many people have disappeared and not reappeared. I generally check in about once a week to see if they're okay and to remind them to reply. After about a month of no contact whatsoever, I will send them a \"this is ending\" and then delete the chat. I think about three times I have actually gotten something out of that whole process. I get people are busy but it takes just thirty seconds to say \"life is crazy, will reply asap\"",
