He basically says \u201cI\u2019m thinking Harvey Dent is running as Governor and Batman tries to stop Penguin\u201d\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a general idea, I mentioned that we could work it into my original idea, he just completely ignores what I say and continue on about his crappy plot.\n\nBut then he says \u201cas game-master, I won\u2019t be writing a lot, maybe a paragraph or two but not a novel. When I game-master for another person\u2019s rp I like to be concise but also clear\u201d\n\nOkay....did he just call himself the \u201cgame-master\u201d....for an Rp that I thought up of?\n\nI asked him \u201cActually since it\u2019s my plot I\u2019d prefer being the Game-Master, or if possible, maybe there is no game-master and we can take turn describing the location\u201d\n\nHe completely ignores me, and goes on saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I have a lot of ideas for villains, not a lot but as Game-Master I have some plots unfolding\u201d and \u201cby the way- as game-master, I like to set the scene rather than use dialogue, that way your character can explore the environment and we can both have a good time\u201d\n\nWhat good time?! He\u2019s coming in here with his dick out, enlisting himself as \u201cGame-Master\u201d without even asking the original poster of the prompt\n\nSo I said \u201cit could\u2019ve been nice of you to ask me if you can be Game-Master before enlisting yourself\u201d and \u201cWould\u2019ve been nice also if you asked before changing my entire RP\u201d\n\n\nHe proceeded to leave and block me\n\nI have photos too, I can send them over if you want",

            "selftext": "It's been a few minutes so I'm finally posting this story from some time ago. I met someone who got my discord tag from one of the popular RP forums that begins with 'E'. They seemed pretty nice, had picked up one of my plotlines, we laid out what our specific interests and triggers were and got to writing. I specifically mention noncon, because it's one of those things I have no interest in at all.\n\nMind you, I am not an ERP author and am really not into smut and was very upfront about this. They had some different tastes than mine, but not ones that drove me out of my comfort zone, and otherwise seemed friendly and like a good writer.\n\nNot much time goes by...they ask me to have my character do some honestly monstrous, despicable things to theirs that aren't noncon, but are noncon adjacent (my character physically beating theirs, etc). Obviously this made me uncomfortable so I told them no, I wasn't going to do that, and prepared to end the RP.\n\nThen this person starts talking about how into noncon they are. This should have been a warning sign. I am not into noncon. I find it triggering. I had told them so and asked them to stop and that I am not comfortable continuing this line of discussion and that I am not going to RP that with them. \n\nThey start going on and on about how I'm writing ahistorical characters into the RP (which had a historical setting), that it would only make sense for my character to want to *physically injure theirs for no reason*, and that I wasn't working with them on this a little. They ask to end the RP which, cool, I was about to get to that but was too busy being thrown by the abject lack of respect for my boundaries and accusing me of not knowing anything about history.\n\nThey then start trying to give me tips on how I can 'get partners to stick around for the future', like I don't know how to do that and like I don't have other regular RPers that have stuck around for awhile. Like the only reason I can't keep RPers is because I can't please them by writing things I'm uncomfortable with.\n\nHonestly this interaction skeeved me out because I'm not sure what it says about you if you're really into noncon and yet clearly can't respect other peoples boundaries. \n\ntl;dr other author kept trying to push serious boundary after I said no, blamed me for being inflexible when the RP ended",

That being said I did meet one RP player that we clicked on every level, gaming music even character development Leeward serious about everything eventually became serious about each other.\n\nOr maybe I was just reading into too much I'm not really even sure anymore, but I am sure of is that because I am always second-guessing everything in my head I fucked everything up. See we used to talk everyday all day what about everything and then when she stopped talking as much well I noticed but there wasn't really much I could do. See I'm used to people coming and going all the time so being ghosted is not exactly something that is new to me. But it was new with this person since neither of us ever stop talking to each other from the moment we woke up till the moments that we went to sleep we were messaging each other are being back and forth joking having fun.\n\nMy guess is that at some point she had started dating someone IRL which is fine since there's no real way that we could date other than long-distance at the time given the distance and covid. Fast forward to a couple of weeks later and between a message every night and I only mean a message every night and sometimes nothing at all even though she was still online I started to feel like well just was another one that was gone. Only it felt more personal than that.\n\nDuring the RP and our chats we started to say things that started to get more personal, feeling started to get brought up in the end I started to care. And it seemed like she did to, then in the end I had told her that I just needed some time because I was hurt I miss my friend and I missed the person that I was getting close to and I felt like it was already over so I got angry, brought her a message to just shut down the RP and that I would come back to it eventually. Well needless to say after that she unfriended me well not blocking me it's quite impossible to add somebody on Discord if you don't know their code. So I was hurt betrayed and angry so I like an idiot send her another message on Reddit where she blocked me. I know I wasn't exactly the most mature in that moment but it hurt, but then again it always happens.\n\nMaybe I'm just an idiot for thinking that things were more than they were, I mean it was an RP after also everything is not exactly real life there but things felt different she was different and now it's over and I will never have a chance to say I'm sorry to her",

            "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying I\u2019m absolutely no stranger to ghosting. I\u2019ve been ghosted plenty and it\u2019s not something new, and something that has just become something you expect with certain roleplays. \n\nHowever, this instance has made me feel very badly about myself and I find myself obsessing over what I could have done wrong. It has made me act out of character and it makes me really sad that this is the case. \n\nI\u2019ve had a wonderful roleplay with a newish partner. Wonderful full plot with tons of side plots planned, a healthy array of side characters that we\u2019ve fleshed out together, and a good amount of OOC banter. Honestly just the most fun and wonderful roleplay I\u2019ve had in a while! We were posting multiple times a day, and I never got the vibe that anything was wrong. It was one of those wonderful roleplays that you think about a lot and get excited for. \n\nI keep OOC pretty relaxed, I dont ask anything too personal and I try to make sure my partner is comfortable. \n\nWell, one day he suddenly just... stopped responding. This is over Discord. He has kept the server, hasn\u2019t deleted me or left it, but just won\u2019t respond. I\u2019ve sent a few (perhaps lengthier than needed) messages explaining that if he needed to take a break or stop the roleplay to just let me know. I also emphasized that if I did something wrong that I was sorry, and that I really enjoyed the roleplay/writing with him. He\u2019s never online(invisible) but I feel like he must have at least read my posts. \n\nIt has been three days and I\u2019m getting the vibe he will never respond, and I\u2019m just going to be left looking like a dummy. I guess I\u2019m confused because he hasn\u2019t made a move to delete anything, and he really didn\u2019t seem like the type of person to just randomly ghost. Like I would think he\u2019d at least say something... but maybe not? My last message to him was that I\u2019ll hold onto hope that he was just away, but that if he did decide to leave then best of luck and I enjoyed writing with him. \n\nIt has made me super sad and distressed which is something I never feel in situations like this one. Typically I\u2019m just bummed and moved on but this one I find myself looking back at messages and posts to try to see what I may have done wrong. Maybe it was my writing? Maybe it was me? I\u2019ve already sent him more than enough messages and I won\u2019t reach out anymore, but I\u2019m bummed out. He doesn\u2019t owe me a response, of course, no one does... but I guess I feel kinda hurt because I really enjoyed our writing together. \n\nI\u2019d be fine ending any roleplay, I guess I just wished there was more of a \u201cclosure\u201d to it than to be left hanging wondering what I did wrong. \n\nI posted this here as more of a venting thing than anything. Just to clarify as well, I work full time and have a healthy outside life so roleplay isn\u2019t my only pride and joy haha. Just feeling a little burned and saddened by a sudden and abrupt ending to a roleplay with someone I thought was cool and a great writer.",

            "selftext": "So if you\u2018ve seen my posts on some RP Subreddits, you\u2019ll know I recently put out an ad for a SWTOR-based Roleplay. It got a few responses, most of which I\u2019m super into and have loved doing these past few days, but there was one on FB (I post RP ads there too) that pissed me right off. \n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not opposed to NSFW scenes. I like a little smuttiness here or there, as long as it doesn\u2019t take over the entire RP and actually fits the characters. So after like a day and a half of writing, sending the characters on different missions and adventures, slowly building their relationship, they go on to do \u201cThe dance with no pants\u201d as the youngin\u2019s say. Was it fun? Yeah. Was it hot? Of course, the Force + Sexytimes always equals a good time. What happened later was like taking Satan\u2019s 4 foot spiky shlong up in my guts. \n\n\nThe character\u2019s \u201cFinish\u201d and I go OOC for a sec to ask the other person if they\u2019d like to timeskip to the next morning so we can move on to other missions (Or, more likely, have to explain to the NPC crew of the ship why they\u2019re coming out of the same room at the same time) But they responded with \u201cActually I think that\u2019s a good spot to end it.\u201d When I questioned further, they said \u201cNo, I got what I came for lol\u201d and proceeded to block me. \n\n\n\nI have since spent the past half hour seething with rage, which is ironic since we were RPing as Sith. Like, I knew my character was a hottie, but REALLY? THAT\u2019S all you wanted?!",

I have a tendency to almost make the other person's character like the \"main\" character since the story will follow their perspective even when my character isn't around.\n\nSo I'll play as side characters that they need to talk to, whether that be a librarian or their own mom.\n\nBut something I always can't stand is when someone insists that you play ALL of the extra characters and npc's.\n\nThis whole rant was because of something that happened very recently:\n\nWe were playing an au from a fandom where their character accidentally drinks a love potion and sees my character first.\n\nIn canon, my character has a significant other but that only happened recently and they were not mentioned in my ad at all. Still, I can see how it's reasonable that they would ask about it after we had started some responses in.\n\nI said that I would be okay with whatever they would want to do with that, but I couldn't play the character myself. (Because I've never played as them, it wasn't necessary, and I didn't want to)\n\nThey respond saying that they couldn't play as them either.\n\nSo why even mention it at all if you're not willing to?\n\nAnd I can understand how I could play as the character and make the plot go along by being a protective significant other. But they could also just as easily play them as a comforting/jealous significant other. The plot possibilities seem equal to me.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get across is that you shouldn't bring up the idea of extra (main) characters if you're not willing to play them yourself.",

            "selftext": "This happened a few days ago started as just a funny no big deal kind of thing and then became pretty funny. \nI'll call the person Buck (not actual name of course).. I saw Buck's ads posted on a bunch of different pages all the time since I got back into RP in December. The ad was always the same and not really something I had an interest in but recently I wanted to get out of my comfort zone so I sent Buck a message. They got back to me, we exchanged discords and then we got to what I'd thought was going to be the planning stages. The little bit of talking we did basically went as \n\nBuck: Hey! What one of my plots/ships did you have an interest in?\nMe: Oh I liked [insert plot here] \n\nBuck didn't respond to me after that. Figured they were just busy and went about my day but then I saw they'd reposted that same ad on a bunch of different pages again. I thought okay maybe they wanted a bit more from me so I sent the idea for the character, a character I recently created that I thought they'd like which is why I contacted them. Again no response. After a couples days I sent them a message asking if they wanted to RP with me at all and again Buck didn't reply. It was fine we hadn't even really talked, I don't even think this really counts as ghosting. I was more so just confused about what put them off. \nA few days passed and I brought it up to an RP partner cause I thought it was just odd kind of funny and immediately my partner is like \"Wait is their name Buck?\" \n\nCome to find out the person I contacted is notorious for ghosting people. They ghosted my partner at least twice and my partner knew people they ghosted as well. Apparently they're so known for it they've been banned from an RP thread. I just thought it was funny. How often they post that ad and put it freaking everywhere you'd think they'd actually do some RPing lmao",

Typical \" I'm gonna do good things because I'm good police officer/politician\" \n\nThis is a dystopia, my dude, it's supposed to be bad. The worst part is they think im weird when i play as a corrupt politician/police officer\n\n2. METAGAMERS\n\nFor example, if I'm roleplaying as a criminal who never got caught, they immediately arrest me. This is super common. PLEASE STOP METAGAMING\n\n3. idiot  \" I'm gonna do good things because I'm good police officer/politician\"\n\nI'll explain. If I'm a hitman, trying to kill a person, and I got caught, and I will give them information in exchange for releasing me. THEY'RE GONNA STRAIGHT UP SAY NO. They didn't even try to trick me!\n\n4.  Weird crossover roleplayers\n\nThis one is not from neon district, but from a game called starship roleplay. I'll make this quick, SOMEONE WAS RP'ING AS A DEMON ON A SPACESHIP THAT INSTA KILLS EVERYONE, Done. Moving on\n\n5. Random Killers\n\nNeed I Say More",

However, to the point someone had to send me a test before we roleplayed seemed a little much.\n\nI consider roleplaying a fairly casual hobby, at least in the terms of standards. Like everyone can appreciate correct spelling and thorough plot development, punctuation and making full sentences but to be super bothered by some comma in a place that it didn't disrupt a thought just seemed... super high strung to me and it rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nExample of the problem:\n   MC grinned, letting a soft and satisfied sigh follow through her lips after the kiss. MC softly giggled, \"I love you too.\" [Taken from my response to the Google Form]\n\nLike I get it, it is incorrect but my point is: does a mistake like that really matter that much?",

I'll be on hiatus for a week and then i should be more active. \n\nAfter not rping for a while after regularly doing  I struggle to get back into it. I like when I'm given time and such and i communicate that usually unless I'm just not active on the server because I haven't been in a while. \n\nBut my partner is like a hawk or something. \nOne of my criteria for a partner is being patient. I'm in school, everyone knows this. But this partner is very observant of me. \n\nI told them once I had to study for a test so i wouldn't be active. They respond w/ \"no worries and keep playing your games while you're at it.\" To which I respond, \"that's not me, that's my brother, i don't play those games\" and they're like \"oh okay\" \n\nFast forward, I've got another test. I need a week hiatus.\nThey tell me, no worries take your time. \nA single day after the week has passed and they're back to messaging me \"Good evenings\" and \"Good Mornings\". \n\nMaybe I'm looking too deep into it, but this is sort of annoying me. Like if i can take my time and there's no worries then why're ya on my case all the time. These messages seem to be on the cusp of rushing me without \"really\" rushing me.

So my apologies if I trigger anyone with my grammar.\n\nA few years ago I got asked by someone if I'd like to RP with him. I told him that I've never done that before but I'd be interested. And he told me that it's no problem and he'll guide me.  \nWe played in the setting of an online game we both played at the time and it went well for a while.  \nI loved how fleshed out his character was and the side characters he was writing about. I really thought that he was a great story teller with an amazing imagination. I mean until I got suspicious and googled the names of the characters he was writing about. His entire backstory was basically copy pasted from an book *series*, which had nothing to do with the game we played. That got me a little upset because when I wrote my characters back story, I was told that ''this doesn't exist/work like that in the setting of the game. You have to change that''. For the record I didn't mean to write anything noncanon, it was an honest mistake, so I rewrote my character's story with his help.   \nThen I noticed that my character wasn't really allowed any growth, as long as it didn't happen through his character helping mine to grow. As a newbie I thought that's part of the guidance to get into this hobby, so again I didn't say anything.\n\nAfter that I noticed that he projected the RP onto me. Our characters became lovers and he started to call me petnames and wanted to talk on voice chat with me, even though I always told him that I don't like these kind of things. RP and RL are two different things for me and I had no desire to get on that kind of level with him ''in person''.\n\nAfter some time we stopped talking altogether until recently. He asked to RP again and I set some rules, for example that I don't want things to get private, because they make me uncomfortable. I also wanted to start in another setting from scratch, creating my OC myself and he said okay.  \nIt started pretty good, but then I noticed that he tried to ''control'' my character again. When his character did something and he didn't like the way my character reacted, he tried to convince me OOC that what he wrote is good and makes sense and that she should like that. When I talked about my characters abilities with technology, he tried to take it over and make something out of it that would force her to accept the help of his character to build her own invention. He would nag OOC so long until I told him to do whatever he wants because I was over the conversation. After that he tried to take charge of another aspect of that invention (how it works and how it looks). This time I stood my ground and told him why it couldn't work the way he says. That I wrote it like that because I put thoughts into it and how it works and most importantly, because it is something I and therefore my character came up with. Yet he would try to push his version to be canon. When I called him out on that he told me ''it's just ideas from me, why are you shutting them down. Nobody takes away your character's invention. It's just my version makes more sense''. After I called him out again he got actually mad at me and stopped responding altogether.\n\nSo here is my question: Is that normal? Is that him just guiding me through RP because I make actual mistakes, or is it him just wanting things done his way?",

            "selftext": "A big thing about keeping trust with your rp partners is transparency. A recent one who has just left doesn't seem to quite get that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of us made OCs related to music. One was about music making, and their's was about dancing. For simplicity's sake, we'll call them 'Chiharo', since that was the name of their OC. Of course, the two hit it off. My OC gave her a grand tour and we had some really sweet conversations, eventually leading to Chiharo's character staying at the house of mine. One of them confessing love was inevitable.\n\nNow, in OOC chat, Chiharo and I bantered about 'Yeah the ship exists but neither of us will let it set sail lol'. But now that we're here? I figured it was about time to give it a shot. So I DM'ed Chiharo asking if they were ok with my OC confessing his love to their's, in which they replied 'I guess you'll find out.' I probed on and on about how I actually needed and answer since this was a crucial moment for both of our characters, and they answered more and more vaguely, all in the name of 'fucking with my mind.' No. No you're not. What you're doing is sabotaging the rp.\n\nMy OC did end up confessing via music, and this is the big one. Chiharo's OC ACCEPTS his confession and verbally states that 'I want to stay with you forever.' While doing stuff like kissing his lips, cuddling, all that love stuff. At the end, they slept together on the couch in each others arms. So, we're set right? The ship has sailed. We're in a relationship now.  \n\n\nTurns out no. My OC woke up to see his new girlfriend gone and instead a goddamn BUSINESS card that thanks him for letting her do her services. So apparently, ALL THIS TIME, Chiharo's OC never really did love mine, but instead made it her duty to make everyone as happy as possible. Obviously, I was completely fucking confused, and told Chiharo that not only was this completely out of nowhere with no warning, oh because of course, le epic mindfucks, but also that this completely contradicts their character of being GENUINELY considerate of other's feelings, apparently without considering the fact that after all of last night, my OC may just be completely heartbroken at the fact. Of course, they replied with 'They're not that bright', and soon after left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you keep important details in the dark for the purpose of having others make their own interesting decisions, while it does sound OK on paper, all it really does is lower the quality of the rp dramatically, especially if you decide to tunnel vision into one and only one possibility, as this example(hopefully) clearly displayed.",

            "selftext": "We've seen the posts. We've all been ghosted at one point or another. I've been ghosted, you've been ghosted. If I had a nickel for every \"omg I just got ghosted\" post that's been on here, I'd be substantially rich by now. And we've all ghosted someone at some point in time even if we don't want to admit to it. I know I don't want to admit that I've ghosted.\n\nAfter seeing  u/ijustlikespoodersok's post calling out the hypocrisy of ghosters, I thought it was time for me to give my very own r/BadRPerStories Ted Talk on the one thing that ***everyone*** complains about: ghosting. I've been RPing for years and dealt with my fair share of ghosting. I'm going to talk about the most common reasons why people ghost (and feel free to add your reasons in the comments). This is gonna be *loooong* so strap yourselves in.\n\n**1: Your Writing Sucks**\n\nAnd we start off with the most heartbreaking reason. It might be one of the more common ones as well. None of us are perfect writers. We all make grammar and spelling and word mistakes from time to time. What I mean by this is when the writing *style* as a whole is very not good. Whether it's someone who seemed to skip school on the day where punctuation and capitalization were taught, a copious misuse of commas, boring/lifeless descriptions, writing 50 paragraphs while not saying anything of worth, purple prose or overuse of certain words, or never-ending run-on sentences that'd make Anne Rice blush, we've all come across someone whose writing style leaves at least a little to be desired. \n\nWhat's the best way to tell someone their writing isn't good while taking part in a hobby that depends on writing? That's like walking up to a painter in the middle of painting and telling them that their paintings are terrible and that they should find another hobby. You can find some ways to lessen the blow (\"*Hey, look, I'm enjoying this RP and all, but your writing would improve if you did xyz*\") but you don't want to come off like an asshole.\n\nWhat makes this reason so prominent is one simple fact. Some authors refuse to either listen to criticism (Norman Boutin would love those of you) while others would break down and have a life crisis over having their writing called anything less than perfect.  And without truly knowing your partner all that well, you have no idea how they're going to react. They might even react by blocking you and ending the RP anyway. So why bother sticking around to find out? Maybe *someday* they'll get the hint that their writing is terrible if they get ghosted enough. Because it's easier to ghost someone than to make them depressed over their writing skills (or lack thereof). *\\[If your partner keeps asking \"is my writing good?\"/\"was that reply/post good?\" they've most likely assumed this reason was why they've gotten ghosted a lot. Thinking your writing isn't good enough and that everyone only says it's good to keep your fee-fees intact is real. Just be delicately honest with your partner and give constructive criticism if/when they ask for it. Easier said than done, I know.\\]*\n\n**2: Your Character Sucks**\n\nFor the same reasons as 1, this one is common. It ties into writing a bit as well. A good writer can take a one-note personality character or even an annoying/bad character and actually flesh them out. Perhaps even make them *likable* in the case of a bad/annoying character. A bad writer makes them into an annoying Mary Sue who can do no wrong and never hates anyone in the history of anything ever because she's just so nice and gentle and everyone loves her and anyone who dislikes her is stupid or evil. Or they'll turn the character into a Gary Stu who can punch 5 guys at once and always wins every battle ever and never gets hurt or in trouble just because they're *that* good oh and they get all the female attention because everyone loves them because they're that perfect. And while writing can be fixed/changed/edited/improved with practice, a character... a character would either have to get retconned pretty bad or go through a decent, nice character arc to \"fix\" their issue(s).\n\nAnd the thing about that is: RPers get attached to their characters. Even if you make a new character for every RP, your characters grow on you. You're *supposed* to like your own character or at least like writing out their stories. Getting told your character is too OP or annoying or bland or \\[insert very negative criticizing word here\\] isn't fun. Especially for those people who get *way* too attached to their characters. Your character is the main source of interaction in the RP.\n\nSo if you get told your character sucks, what can you do to \"fix\" them? It's not an easy fix. And if you don't know your partner that well, you don't know how they'll take that criticism. They'll probably just go *\"how* ***dare*** *you criticize my character, she's a sweet lil ray of sunshine, she's never done anything wrong!!!! idk y u hate her so much but I'll find someone who likes her to RP with instead\"* and ghost you. Maybe they'll finally get the hint that their character is nothing more than a boring Mary Sue if they get ghosted enough. Because it's easier to ghost someone than to piss them off or make them depressed about their character or start all the way over with the RP.\n\n**3: Your Plot is Boring**\n\nYou can somewhat tie this into 1 because writing can make an exciting plot boring. And sometimes this has *nothing* to do with the writing. Sometimes you think a plot would be interesting to you (\"oh, I'd like to try a Wild West plot!\") then you get into it and you realize it's boring (\"... I thought this would be a constant action fest, turns out this is just the plot of 'The Searchers' except John Wayne is played by Adam Driver... um... okay...\"). It could also just be plain writing burnout as well, or you can be far along in the plot before the boredom sets in.\n\nThe easiest thing to do would be to just tell your partner \"hey, I'm bored of this plot, can we change it up?\". But if you literally *just* started this plot or if you're suffering from writing burnout, you may not want to continue the plot at all. And if you know your partner is passionate about the plot, you may have a hard time admitting you lack the same enthusiasm. Or your partner was the one who came up with the plot and you agreed with every last thing they suggested and you'd feel bad for telling them you had changed your mind. And if you did tell them \"hey, the plot's boring\", they may just go \"okay cool bye I'll go find someone else\" and leave you without a partner. Because it's easier to ghost someone than to admit that the plot you two crafted isn't doing it for you. *\\[If you think you deal with this a lot, try involving your partner(s) more with the plot. \"How are you liking the plot so far?\", \"What do you think should happen next?\" are good questions to ask OOC.\\]*\n\n**4: You Don't Meet The Writing Requirements**\n\nOkay, this one really ties into 1. You work hard on your starter, look over it several times, make sure it's flawless. You think it's great. You send it and... Nothing. They've gone. One reason I think this happens (other than reasons 1 or 2) is because they look at your writing and go \"well, I can't write ***that*** much\". Or perhaps even the opposite: \"they ***certainly*** don't write a lot\". People like to judge your RP ability on a starter (or a sample piece of writing, that is *if* you can get them to give you a sample first). If one of you writes a paragraph per reply and the other only a sentence... One of you is either going to have to live with it or move on to someone else. And starters, in my experience, tend to be one of the longer posts I make. So an RPer who only writes a sentence every time has to read through two paragraphs? It's easier to ghost than to admit that you can't keep up with someone else's requirements for responses. *\\[If you think you deal with this a lot, try requiring samples or making sure your lengths/style match up.\\]*\n\n**5: Writing Burn Out / Life Happens**\n\nThis one happens to writers. Even professional ones who do it for a living. Especially after 2020. Stress, depression, low self-esteem, and anxiety are all creativity killers. And those are all things we have to face in our day-to-day lives. There is nothing wrong with writer's block or being burnt out with your personal life. Or having something happen in your life that limits how much you can/want to RP. Life happens. But some people seem to think there *is* something wrong with writer's block/burnout. Some partners like to think that your personal life isn't as important as theirs or the RP. Some partners will think that you saying \"I'm burnt out\" means \"I'm leaving and never coming back, go ahead and move on without me and forget that I even existed\". Sometimes you may not even *want* to admit you're having issues in your life or may not even *realize* you have issues going on until they hit you all at once. Or worse: there's stigma around your mental issue(s) and you don't want to hear nonsensical crap about it.   \n\n\nAnd sometimes you have no idea if you even *want* to come back to RP once you feel like writing again. Honestly, this one can happen 1 of 2 ways: 1 - you purposefully ghost because you're afraid of the backlash you'd get from your partner for admitting that you're burnt out. 2 - you just stop replying one day because of an emergency, mental health issue (like depression), or just needing a break for a few days and by the time you get back your partner has moved on and ghosted you. Because sometimes it's easier to ghost than to admit that you're having issue(s) in your life. *\\[If you think your partners deal with this a lot, patience is key. If they come back, great! If they don't, don't get hung up on it. If it's you who's dealing with burnout / life happens, consider taking a break from RP for a while. Give your creative batteries time to recharge. Also, try to give your partner a heads up about it and just explain your reason(s) for having to pause the RP for a while. If they give you grief over it, they're most likely not worth your time in the first place.\\]*   \n\n\n**6: You're a Creep**  \nThis is one of the most unfortunate and sadly all too common reasons to ghost someone. And it's also one you can't really work around or adjust to (unless you find being creeped on flattering, in which case... are you okay?). If ghosting vents are the #1 most popular type of post on here, creeps probably come to a #2. People who are looking for online romantic/sexual partners to cyber with use RP to their advantage. Everything will be fine and dandy in the RP until they start propositioning you for personal, sexual info OOC. Sometimes they'll even start right off the bat with the creepy sexual undertones both in and out of RP. Some people will start the RP for like a day or two before switching to OOC and asking all kinds of questions about you and your personal life that you may or may not be comfortable with answering all while ignoring the RP all together. You ask them to stop, tell them you're just not interested. Yet they seem to think that 'stop' and 'no' somehow mean 'keep going' and 'yes'. There are many different ways creeps try to get into people's pants. There could probably be a post in and of itself all about it.   \n\n\nSadly, there's no cure for this one. The best you can do is tell them \"will you ***please*** stop trying to flirt with me? I'd rather be stuck in a room with Gaston than have you flirting with me. I said no, knock it off\" and hope that they listen. Sometimes they'll even try and guilt trip you into accepting/doing whatever it is they want you to (\"stop being such a prude, it's just RP\", \"you're just lonely, I'm only trying to help out\"). Sometimes you may even consider doing it ***just*** to get them to **stop**. The best thing to do every single time is to ghost. Because it's definitely easier to ghost than it is to put up with a creepy moron who can't understand the word \"NO\". *\\[You can try looking through their Reddit profile to avoid this one, but even then, you never know. Some people have even stopped RPing with men because of it. There's no easy answer to 'fix' this one.\\]*  \n\n\nI know these aren't *all* the reasons in the *entire* world. I have a feeling someone's going to point out a reason I should've thought of lol. But these are the 6 that I think are the most common reasons for ghosting. Are there ways to work around these reasons? Maybe. Sometimes ghosting feels inevitable and feels like the best option you have. But when you get ghosted for seemingly no reason, it's frustrating. I hope my reasons help people understand *why* ghosting is such a thing. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

            "selftext": "I recently joined a game and found an RP server that seemed interesting (mainly about competing clans of slavers and power exchange RP and ERP) The problem I see is the moderators. The server has a constant turnover of both slavers and slaves due to the OOC decisions of the two moderators. One moderator has decent and interesting RP but has draconian OOC rules for the subs that causes them to cycle almost daily. The other mod is just plain boring. I don't want to RP as a slave if we are just going to have vanilla ERP. dominate me, in and out of the bedroom, make the rules harsh, tax my mental limitations to obey(yes I have brought up these concerns as I understand that being a sub is not about being passive). \n\nThere is nothing in between, and the mods get the lion's share of subs that show up(they show up daily, and then leave just as fast), which causes burnout for the non mod doms, because they just get to play the game normally while the two mods get to enjoy all the ERP while the poor potential doms have to sit there and twiddle their thumbs(and also eventually leave out of boredom). Am I nuts for being attached to some of the people there or should I abandon ship while I still can?",
