I understand the purpose is to prove they've read your ad thoroughly, but I think it's easy enough to tell if people have read my ad or not when they send me an initial message. No judgment, however!\n\nWhat is new for me is to have someone respond to *my* passcode-free ad with their own copy + pasted ad with clear instructions for me to send them the hidden passcode \"or else\".  (And I know they didn't just accidentally leave in the passcode requirement when copy + pasting, because they sent a new message after with 'don't forget the passcode or else I'll block')\n\nI already dislike when people respond to my ad with their own ad, but it's extra off-putting to do so and also say \"you must respond with 'cupcake farts' (or whatever the dumb pw is) or else I'm blocking you.\" Like, really?",

I completely understand I just feel really stupid and kind of pathetic. \n\nAnyhow I felt badly for a while about all of this then I realized I\u2019m the one being a creep getting personal and stuff . \n\nI suppose I just needed to vent this a bit but any comments would be appreciated..

It's tons of fun to collaborate with others and I've made some amazing friends who I've known for over a decade now that I keep in contact with. They're amazing, they're wonderful, this kind of connection has honestly been what has helped me keep going in some rather dark moments and I'm sure there are plenty of people who also feel the same. It's the hunt for these people that is the killer - the ad search, the new partner interviews, the sifting through people who read nothing about your ad other than you're looking for a game and just DM you with a \"wana rp\" or \"rpwith me!\" (spelling included). No intro, no info about them, nothing of value so I can judge whether we'd be a good fit.\n\nI am completely aware that quantity is NOT quality, you can write 2000 words and it is littered with spelling and grammar errors and just absolutely nothing of value. I totally get this and I consider myself pretty flexible depending on the scene. Opening scenes where I'm leading the action and describing the world and environment can easily run me through multiple paragraphs as I try to set the stage and give my partner as much IC info as possible so that the other player doesn't feel like they have to compromise the personality of their character to follow the plot we laid out. On the other hand, basic dialogue can easily be just a couple of sentences back and forth to keep the plot moving - no reason for my character to be thinking about what's going on outside the coffee shop when on a first date, right? It'd be unnecessary fluff that slows down the game because it takes me longer to write. \n\nI list in my ad that I write a lot, depending on the scene. I list that I only roleplay with adults. I list that I've had some bad experiences roleplaying with men and I'm only just reopening myself to give them another chance - thankfully this has led to a new great partner who I really enjoy writing with so far. \n\nBUT FUCK. If I haven't had to sift through so many people who, when I ask for a writing sample, send me things like this: \n\n&gt;\" XXX walked up to the table where the key lay. XXX followed. She began jumping trying to grab the edge of the table but it was no use. XXX came up behind her and swept her of her feet and gracefully sat her on his shoulders...it was still no use.\u201dso close\u201d XXX moaned her finger where inches away. Just then XXX noticed a small wooden box under the table. \u201cWhats this down here?\u201d He took XXX down off his shoulder and opened up the box. Inside there was small paper squares that had the words \u201ceat me\u201d . XXX looked at XXX and said \u201ctogether?\u201d she nodded. XXX counted down from three and at the same time placed the paper tabs in their mouth. \"\n\nand this (all character names have been removed for the sake of the persons anonymity) \n\n&gt;\" \\*He had just woken up, but he wanted to experience the love of roleplay he once knew. He finally had time to build a world with his new partner. His only hope is that this person accepts him as a roleplay partner.\\*\"\n\nIs my writing perfect? Fuck no. This is a hobby and I'm happy to run my shit through spell check and Grammarly and hope it makes as much sense as possible. People make human errors in their writing and I would never expect someone's writing to be perfect and editor level clean. I've agreed to game with people who write less than me, it's not too big of a deal, but the first one is covered in mistakes and the second one is just... odd. But also, when I tell people I don't think we are going to be a good fit, I try and do so politely and will literally just say, \"Hey, I'm sorry but I don't think our writing styles match, thank you for your time, happy hunting!\" And most of the time? That's the end of it, people thank me for my time and don't message again and I wish them the best on their partner hunting. \n\nOccasionally, I get push back. \"That's not a good representation of my writing!\" Then why did you send it? \"I'm adaptable!\" Then why didn't you put your best foot forward when I say how much I usually write in my ad? I'm trying to be polite, if I answered honestly why we aren't compatible I'd probably hurt some feelings but when they keep pushing when I tell them I'm not interested in a game with them it's just frustrating. \n\nI also understand that writing samples are not the be-all-end-all of a person's ability, that sometimes they are stolen or extra polished, but it has saved me time and effort of people who post like this. There are totally people out there who would love to write with them, that's chill, go have fun, but if you're gonna approach someone about a game maybe don't skip their \"about me\" section on their ad to jump to their plots. \n\nI've had people under the age of 18 approach me for a game and not let me know until we had already exchanged discord handles - keep in mind all of my search posts are marked NSFW and I specify multiple times in my post that I do NOT roleplay with minors. \n\nWhen I approach people for a game, I read through their post multiple times, sometimes even going back to read it again as I format a message to them in hopes of making sure I've checked all the question boxes they are gonna ask. I don't understand why people can't extend the same courtesy. There's nothing wrong with asking if someone was willing to play something different than what they listed, I've approached people who only play one gender and asked if they would be willing to double up (unless it's specified that they won't) and if they say no, I back off. I don't keep pushing about \"Why won't you write with me?\" \"I guess I'm just not good enough .\\_.\" Like oh my god, you want me to pity write with you? You want me to slag my way through a game I HATE because I can barely understand what's going on in your scene? Cause I don't want to do that, I want to enjoy this hobby and I don't owe you a game just because I posted an ad - an ad you CLEARLY didn't read!\n\nThen you get people who get past the initial stage and pull some shit like \"You can't know anything about my character other than this reference picture because it's for suspense\" like... I'm not reading a book! This is a collaborative story! Keep some secrets, fine, but when you get stuck on ideas for your character and I can't help because I know NOTHING about the history and motivation of your character, that's on you. OR they'll insist on playing characters that seem from a different universe altogether! Modern-day superhero roleplay? Cool, their character has spears and chainmail.... for some reason. Like people still have guns... what is your character going to do with a spear when that isn't tied to a power they have. Why do they even need a spear when they have superpowers? \n\ntl;dr - I'm some random bitch that is frustrated while looking for new partners and popped off in a vent that is way too long.",

It was. 2x2, which was new for me but I was willing to try it out because the plot seemed really interesting. We discuss things, everything seems fine, and we start. During the beginning of the roleplay things were fine, but they started to become iffy once characters met. Right off the bat there was a lot of suggestive behavior with his characters toward mine. I let him know that I wasn\u2019t okay with that when the characters had just met. He was upset with me about it but we continued on with the promise that he\u2019d stop. Not long after that he continued with the suggestive behavior. Within just a few days into the roleplay he had gotten angry with me that one of his characters and one of mine hadn\u2019t done the nasty yet. After after arguing about it we compromised and had a romantic scene, but nothing sexual. More red flags were raised when we he wanted me to change my characters entirely so his would have something new to fuck because he was tired of the old ones. Tell me that\u2019s not fucked up. So we got into yet another argument. I tell him I\u2019m not comfortable with role playing with him anymore considering all the behavior he\u2019s put forward, to which he told me how bad of a partner I was and that this was why nobody wanted to roleplay with me. I had never stated that I had a lack of partners before, but I\u2019m glad that roleplay had ended.",

Cool.  \n\n\nSo I'm looking for partners on Tumblr (I'm a sad individual with 11 years of RP under my belt) and I've scoured the internet to find people who are interested in the stuff I'm into. I follow a looking for rp page on tumblr and I see a couple of players who don't like 'fade to black' etc and are into transformation and things like that, right?   \n\n\nShe lists herself as \"Having no limits\". COOL! I think to myself and add her on Skype (Discord was not a thing at this point) and pray she adds me back. We get to talking, she tells me she likes to worldbuild and create characters on the fly. COOL! THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME! I send her a map that I made in photoshop of the world I created.\n\nShe tells me that she doesn't accept files from people on Skype, that's okay, I thought it's understandable but when I apologise, she just unfriends me instead of discussing this problem. I don't know what I did to cause offense by sending an image but I'm annoyed that my behaviour to cause offense wasn't discussed and I get ghosted.  \n\n\nAnother person I add from Tumblr, who also has no limits simply BALKS at the mention of muscle growth after claiming she has no limits and ghosts me as well. So I'm annoyed that people on tumblr are saying they've got no limits are merely saying it to be trendy and throw up in their mouths from mentioning x which would be considered \"Vanilla\" by a certain RP site I use.  \n\n\nReddit was a waste of time too, I would outline things as mandatory and there would be people who messaged me privately to ask for things I didn't want to include in my RP Plot. Let's say if I wanted no purple hair and multi, they'd message me saying they don't like any of the included stuff and have the balls to ask me for things that I didn't want.  \n\n\nSo here I am, the polar opposite of a vanilla roleplayer...with nobody to play with and people who just enjoy wasting my time. I want to RP with people but having people get their jollies by trolling me, I don't argue with them or feed the trolls, I just block them straight away...but I have to say it's adding insult to injury.",

You find a partner that's interested in all of the stuff you're pitching to her and then they flat out tell you that their feelings are more important than yours.\n\nShe realizes that she's offended you and she's wracking her brain trying to figure out what she did wrong indicating that they don't really have any self-awareness of their actions. Then attempts to justify their lack of empathy as she, well, her \"character' doesn't interact with people and therefore she forgets other people have feelings.\n\nWhich is actually a reflection of her player that narcissistically lives through her character.\n\nBut when she finds a post venting about it (no names were mentioned) and frankly I was understandably upset that she lacks any and all empathy while then blaming the victim and calling me self-absorbed for being upset, and wanting nothing to do with her, then has the audacity to call me \"cruel\" which is laughable because I have the right to protect myself from toxic people.\n\nShe then decides to join another roleplay site which is leaps and bounds different from the other site I used, one that I am a veteran roleplayer on decides to create a profile and a character page. Given her toxic behaviours, she creates a character annnd...it's not taken well.\n\nPeople dislike trolls/toxic people and needless to say, she didn't log back in after she creates her character because they reported her for her abusive, bratty behaviour and she did not log in after that because she's basically vilified because of her overwhelmingly monstrous behaviour.\n\nSo guys, please be careful of toxic people in your roleplay communities, they tend to hide in the nooks and crannies of the RP community and they will come out.",

I posted looking for roleplay, I made it clear that I have a setting that I created that I am looking to world build for a new story.   I personally enjoy when people have their own worlds created, makes my job easier. \n\nSo, through the last day I've received this:\n\n1. People who did not read the ad at all\n2. People who did not meet the requirements\n3. People who messaged me and were annoyed that these requirements existed and tried to get around them.\n4. Asking to do something that is exactly what I said is not what I wanted\n\nLook, I get it, maybe you liked my idea but I don't appreciate anyone being lazy and unable to read the basic ad before doubling down into my idea.  Some people didn't even remember what they were replying to and asked about a completely different genre. \n\nI don't ghost people, I'm patient and I listen.  When I look for RP, I read ads in full to make sure it is what I want before I even approach the person. Today I went through several people, people who I felt manipulated me a little, straight up didn't read my ad or led me to believe they could do what they could not. \n\nAlso, don't act like somehow you are better than me because I have basic standards for writing. \n\n\"Well, I really want to focus on characters that's why I don't want to do what you have listed.\"\n\nBRUH. I focus on character and world-building in ALL of my RPs, I'm not a half-ass, don't use your lack of writing ability as an exchange for character development.  If all you write is 5 paragraphs of 1 sentence, that's just really hard to read.",

            "selftext": "Okay so I was minding my own business in a roleplay chatroom. When this guy messages me, he likes pokemon and some pretty gross fetishes. He's pretty creepy and he's coming on really strongly. I assert myself and say no because frankly, he's making me uncomfortable.\n\nBecause his character is a pokemon and I like pokemon, mind you, this guy was wanting to ERP with me I was deemed a \"hypocrite\" which was not the correct use of the word at all. I was simply asserting myself and saying no to someone who is into doing RP's that involve things that belong in a toilet and fart RP's.\n\nHis logic was: \"I like pokemon but I don't like his character so I must not really like pokemon so therefore I'm a hypocrite because I don't want to play with him.\"\n\nNot that he was friggin' creepy and offputting from the start. He just wanted to have rabid fart rp with me and basically be disgusting, which was not my bag at all.\n\nIt gets better. I hear about him on twitter harassing someone on twitter who surprise, surprise, also finds him creepy because he \"hugs people tightly\" because hello is boring apparently and...normal.  \nI tell people to stay away from this little asshole because he's toxic and never admits to anything bad that he does.\n\nThen all of a sudden one of his \"\"friends\"\" (who is very clearly him on an alt) leaps to his defence and says that I'm harassing ***HIM*** and I also said that he should die. In some very flimsy attempt to undermine my credibility by claiming I said very toxic things. When I didn't, there were a few people on twitter very eager to call him out on his shit by telling him that I didn't say that and he was making up shit.\n\nBecause he believes his own very poorly thought out lies to villify me, his immense ego made him think that his thought that idiotic plan would work because he was extremely narcissistic and therefore lacks empathy and self-awareness and he would come out of that altercation a hero. Thankfully nobody did. They were sane people.\n\nHe also had a conversation with himself on his alt account that he used to whiteknight himself which was a very poor attempt to prove his \"\"friend\"\" was real.  He basically had a small back and forth about people not thinking he's real and that he, on his main account, knew that he was real because he was his friend in real life when it was nothing but\n\n\"HELLO REAL FRIEND, THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING ME, YOU ARE VERY REAL BECAUSE I DEFINITELY HAVE MET YOU AND ARE REAL\"\n\nThere were massive gaps in the dates of his alt accounts and it shows that he doesn't use it often, only to back himself up because the dude is just so friggin' unpleasant he certainly doesn't have many friends.\n\nNow, I don't dox people by posting their usernames on reddit, but someone with  Chimchar in their username makes you uncomfortable, then it's more than likely him. He'll throw a tantrum if you find him creepy and he'll abuse you for it then he'll poorly try to ruin your life.\n\nJust block him and carry on with your day, people. Be sure to block his alts too, he'll throw them at you because he is an absolute child.",

            "selftext": "What's with people asking to rp but then bailing without a word? Like, they ask and then they disappear. \n\nThey ask, we talk for a moment about how they'd have to be a bit patient because school and that and they're fine with it. It's going well until it's not they're gone they haven't messaged me back when i ask them about their characters or plot setting or something. \n\nThis usually happens after i send them a doc with the characters i want to use on them. I get not wanting to rp with those characters. We can totally work something out i just need communication. Though if there isn't communication then i wouldn't know to make a new character or anything of that matter. \n\nSo odd when you think you've hit it off with someone and they delete your contact. Can't reply to the thread. \n\nThere's also the time when they come in with an oc of mine they're interested in. Then suddenly they're also gone? It's really odd. I mean obviously it wasn't meant to be, but i don't get this behavior. It's been happening a lot lately and I've never really encountered it before. Why ask to rp, but dip when it's time to get the basics down?",

I used to role play with a guy who did sexual scenes with me one time, once it's done, he just starts talking to me about if I could send pictures and stuff because my writing got him horny.  \n\nI told him no for like more than 5 times. He messaged me on a different platform, even calling me *baby girl*, *princess* and *darling* as if those words would persuade me into sending him stuff. I ignored him and went to sleep. I woke up and saw lots of fucking videos from him, jerking off, moaning my name and sending texts that describe how bad he wants to take me or something. \n\nI left him on read and he got so infuriated, he started saying how I was acting like a snobby bitch and that why wasn't I thankful that he told me *his big dick got hard because of how good I was with writing*. \n\nUpon reading that line, I started arguing back to him, explaining that I do not always role play because I'm aroused and I would want to get off. I also told him I write because writing means a lot to me and it's a way for me to clear my head.\n\nIt ended up to him getting even mad. He started insulting me saying that writing won't get me to anything. That's when I remember I wanted to be picky with trying to make role play partners.",

            "selftext": "So I had a server going with a partner on a well known social media site and everything was going great. We had been posting everyday, chatting OOC, occasional flirting from either side, brainstorming scene ideas and then poof, nothing. I messaged yesterday morning to see how she was but didn't get a reply so before I went to bed I sent a message asking if she was OK. This morning I find out she has now left the server without saying anything.\n\nTried to ask if she was OK via DM's but I've either been blocked or her account has been deleted. I believe she has deleted her account as we were in a couple of RP servers together but now we don't share any servers.\n\nIf not mad or pissed off or angry, I'm just feeling very deflated as if I have done something wrong. I'm seriously debating giving up on this roleplaying malarkey.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I hope you\u2019re having a lovely day here! Today I\u2019d like to discuss an incident from a certain sub that I\u2019ve seen multiple people ranting about for awhile, run by a person with a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d mindset. Now, I was reluctant to make this post, as accidents happen. However, this problem happened for a third time, so I thought I\u2019d bring it to people\u2019s attention. \n\nMost of my posts get 1 if not 0 votes. If I wanted to use vote manipulation, believe me, my posts would have MANY more upvotes. Occasionally though, I make a post that is an outlier, getting 5 or more upvotes. We\u2019ve ALL made a post here that\u2019s resonated with others, such is life. On all three occasions, each post was locked by this moderator. I\u2019ve posted this exact same one in the past. It breaks no rules. But because little ol\u2019 me had a popular post, there\u2019s no other explanation- VOTE MANIPULATION. \n\nI also wonder if maybe this person does this to posts they personally don\u2019t like? Even if it breaks none of their extensive rules, if it\u2019s not for them, you\u2019re done. \n\nNeedless to say, I should have listened to you all about this particular sub and my own friends, but being naive, I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. I wish nothing bad on this sub, but I do hope they learn to communicate better and listen to their members while treating them with the respect we all deserve. \n\nAnyway, thank you for hearing my rant, and have you had a similar experience? Have a wonderful day! \u2764\ufe0f",

Because I only have so many good ideas that would actually work. And if you say something they don\u2019t like? They disconnect. But if you don\u2019t say anything? They refuse to start the chat and will disconnect. Also the fact that the canon time period of the media is literally the 80\u2019s but everyone wants to rp modern au\u2019s for the sake of texting irp being easier ?? It\u2019s SO boring! But god forbid you whip out an actual, well written starter with plot because they\u2019ll disconnect and you won\u2019t get to use it. It\u2019s just so annoying and frustrating.

            "selftext": "When I first started RPing maybe five or six years or so ago. I had found an RP partner in a game that I still play today. He had the same well near same preferences as I did. One of my main rules was that I didn't want to RP with someone's alternate character. And that I preferred to partner up with someone that only has one RP partner. Meaning, if we were RPing together there wouldn't be anyone else. I had made myself pretty clear that it was what I wanted. He said he was fine with it and then we began our adventure.\n\nNow, during our adventure we've made some friends along the way, we did content as well as RP, which frankly made me really happy. Until one of our friends started lamenting on their lack of a partner. I, being the helpful ~~dormat~~ person that I am, offered to help them find a partner. Which they turned down, because they admitted they had their eye on someone already.\n\nApparently that someone was my own RP partner. Now let me talk about him a little bit. He was a very good writer, and an awesome RP partner. He was very detailed, and thorough in his posts that, frankly it made me want to be a better RP partner. So when we RP'd we would have a very good rapport and back and forth that flowed perfectly. And our friend apparently wanted that. \n\nNow, I love to RP I can RP every day. As long as it was mixed in with content and the like. But, I also worked part time so there were times I wasn't available to RP and was not able to RP on discord because clearly at work so no phones allowed.  And this...was when the friend made their move. Now see, they were unemployed at the time, so they were more available to RP then I was. My partner at the time worked at a very generous place that gave him an ability to be on his computer and what not so you can see what happened.\n\nAt first, he made a character to RP with theirs. Which...was fine for me. Not really, I was peeved because one of my rules was no other RP partners/characters. Was it a fair rule? I mean it's debatable but he agreed to it before we started RPing. But what ended up happening was that they were now constantly RPing together on those characters. It got to the point where, I would basically wait for him to make time to RP with me. In a week time frame, I got maybe.... an hour of RP with him before he had to cut it short because there was an event the friend wanted to go too and it was very important. \n\nNow, I did try talking to him about it, that he was brushing me aside and what would happen is that he would RP with me for a little bit longer but eventually he backslid to continue RPing with friend. And...well it got worse? I had to do a full day at work, so instead of part time I was there for a double shift so to speak. When I came home, logged into the game and checked my friend list, it showed them in the same area... with the RP flag on...but, it was friend and...his character partnered with mine. When I messaged him, I didn't get a response. So I messaged friend and same response. I tried again but then, in the game when you put on busy, it prevents you from getting messages. So, it was basically that. I checked my friend list again and they both had busy symbol next to their names instead of RP. \n\nOne of my friends offered to go on an alt character and track them down. Which I accepted, because I knew it would have looked really bad if I did it. Well, turns out it was good that I didn't go because the two where well...having what appeared to be a very intense ERP session. That they didn't bother keeping the posts in private, I'm assuming that since it was a remote location that no one would have stumbled upon them. When I confronted them on discord, it appeared that they had both left the shared discords we had...and also blocked me. \n\nI never found out what happened, or well I can easily guess what happened but, I admit I was pretty hurt at losing an RP partner and a friend at the same time. And obviously, I still play the game but those two, last I heard from mutual friends is that they ended up server transferring to a different data center and apparently they dated IRL as well. \n\nSo there you have it. I've learned to be less rigid with my expectations. And I've a long term partner that treats me very nicely both IC and OOC. So I guess in the end, something good  came out of it?",

It seems to be happening more and more, where someone will write 2 \"paragraphs\" but there is not even a period or comma in sight. I can understand maybe not knowing when to end a sentence so it may run on for a bit but just noy using any form of punctuation is odd to me. Has anyone else come across partners like this or have I just caught the weird ones? If you are one of the few who don't use any type of punctuation, why? I'm honestly very curious.",

My most recent venture was over a year ago after I got tired of being ghosted and just no one responding to me.

            "selftext": "So I've been chatting with someone for a while now, mostly casual stuff, nothing really out there. I've also RP'd with this person and they're pretty good at it really, though I can't help but wonder if something is just going to go a way I'm all too familiar with. I'm hoping to find someone to do some romantic RP with, maybe with more story too, but this one in particular I'm worried about. From what she's said I think I can spot some warning signs for this... We haven't known each other for the longest time, a few weeks at best really.  \n\n\nFor starters, she mentions that she thinks her character is going to be \"perpetually single\" despite the fact that romance RP is one of the main things she's looking for, with some clear preferences... she hasn't updated this info or even changed it around slightly, so that makes me think that she wasn't being entirely honest. Then I find out that she actually has been RPing with someone that fits said preferences, and past experience tells me that it's going to go the way I think it will.  \n\n\nA MAJOR warning sign, and something that should be common curtesy NOT to do is straight up offer another one of your characters when asked about the portential RP... which she did flat out before saying the previous statement about being single. This is probably the biggest issue, as not only is my interest to rp more met with... well, that, but also that things might be going on that I'm just not told of.  \n\n\nNext she tells me that she wasn't doing much and wouldn't be on for much longer when I started to chat with her last night/today. I didn't think much of it until I got a nagging feeling a whoa and behold, she was RPing with that same person that fit her preference for a romance RP partner. I voiced my realization and headed off before posting this to see if anyone else has been through things like that. In all my years of RPing on WoW I can certainly say that this all raises the right flags for a potential dead end for the type of RP I'm hoping for.  \nI've talked with her before honestly and said that if anything was going on before hand then she would just have to let me know for transparency's sake. She said she'd let me know if \"she suddenly got very serious with someone\" and I'm not sure if I should stick my neck out when I could very well be tossed aside just because she found the attention she wanted. After all, why should I bother again if I know how it'll turn out?  \n\n\nAm I overthinking it? Should I voice my concerns the next time I'm able or just move on already like I'm somewhat planning to do, effectively ghosting if need be?",

            "selftext": "Just wanted to rant a bit because I got permanently banned on a rp search forum on Reddit because I forgot to tag a role as NSFW. It truly was an honest mistake and someone quickly pointed it out only a couple minutes after I had posted it, so I went to fix it, then I later get a message that I have been banned. Now I can only view other people's posts, and cant comment or post my own. For those curious about what my role was, here it is:\n\n\"Hi! I am in search of someone who would like to play the role of Lucifer Morningstar. This role would loosely be based off of the Netflix series, and I say loosely because the other characters would not really be involved and it involves my original character becoming pregnant with his baby after being in a loving relationship with him for about 2 years. This is mostly a romance RP, and I would rather keep sexual scenes to a bare minimum or no scenes like that at all. I dont really have a set plan for this role other than us being in a happy relationship, so in a way this could be considered as improv, but I would definitely like to see how you play him out as a father because I think it could be pretty cute and interesting. I would like to roleplay using private message on Reddit or Discord. I am fine with whichever one. I would really like to play this role so if you are interested please reach out to me! Usually i am fast with my replies but if I cant be I will tell you. I am semi literate with my role playing. I would really rather if the person I play with is over 18, I am a 19F. Thank you for reading! Please no ghosting! Serious inquiries only! If you do not want to play anymore just tell me instead of leaving out of the blue.\"",

            "selftext": "Confession time.\n\nSo, there are several reasons why I'm a bad RPer, a lot which have to do with my mental illnesses.\n\n1. I ghost. A LOT. Sometimes it's because I've lost interest in a plot, other times it's because I don't like my partner's character and I don't want to inotiate conflict by saying something. It all boils down to not having enough energy/motivation to continue or just take the plunge and cut the cord.\n\n2. I'm a bit of a quality snob. I despise non-realistic faceclaims, if we're using them at all (anime is a huge pet peeve). I could love someone's character, the plot, the setting the whole basket. But as soon as I see cartoony images as references, I'm immediately turned off the idea. Likewise, if I don't like my partner's writing style or I think their ideas are clich\u00e9/stupid/unrealistic, it has the same effect.\n\n3. Long posters intimidate me, but many short posters don't meet my quality expectations. I'm picky but I find it hard to express in any ads I put up because I don't want to scare people off.\n\n4. My availability is erratic for no \"proper\" reason. Due to mental illness, my sleeping pattern flips on its head frequently and can make it hard to give an idea of when people can expect replies from me.\n\n5. If someone messages me, and I don't have enough spoons to really communicate, I will straight up ignore them until I'm ready to talk again. I feel like this makes me seem aloof and like I don't like someone, which isn't the case.\n\n6. I say yes too easily to plots, kinks or ideas I don't necessarily like when I'm desperate for RP or I think I've found a partner who fits my quality and length wants, and end up hating it later.\n\n7. I'm really fickle, and will often lose interest in an RP, even if I initially really liked it and was excited by it.\n\nI fully expect \"grow up and learn to communicate\" and \"you're too picky\" responses, so pull out your pitchforks and torches, my body is ready.",

            "selftext": "Let's skip the intro and get right into it. You got three types:\n\n1. Unaware: Guy starts yelling at his team to move when it's a stealth mission. Everyone dies.\n\nGuy also tends to ignore blatant warning signs from a GM/DM about traps and landmines. Never bothers to disarm them either, so they blow themselves up when they retreat.\n\nGuy tends to do dumb stuff, like drive a truck through the uncharted jungle, where the GM/DM states that there are no roads.\n\nOne time, a guy popped in as a helicopter pilot without permission (discord group RP, permission to join was in the rules) when I initially described the helicopter as extracting a group of betrayers. Got confused when he also became a traitor at the end.\n\n2. Rambo: This one is fairly obvious. No, Winter, you aren't a bullet sponge. Stop trying to charge the enemy, they have a tank.\n\nGuy shoots anyone he gets a bead on, even if it jeopardizes the mission. Tries to shoot down aircraft with a sniper rifle. Tries to shoot guardsmen with an unsuppressed rifle during a heist.\n\n3. Words too hard: GM/DM describes a tactical scenario. Guy just says \"I shoot at them.\"\n\nDescribe a grenade being thrown at them. \"I pick it up and throw it back.\"\n\nDescribe four mercs rushing him, since he never said anything about positioning. \"I shoot at them.\"\n\nI don't understand why would they join a mil-sim server if they aren't gonna mil-sim. Thought it was about character interactions and pretending to be professional, maybe pulling off a few cool tricks.\n\nI don't expect RP'ers to be perfect, hell I was never in the military. I'm not a novel writer, either. I just want a baseline amount of thought put into their in-character actions. Shouldn't be hard.",
