The plotting and ideas are generally split 50/50 with both of us actively contributing and adding more to the rp but as the tag implies they have a  flaw since nobody is perfect. Their characters all feel identical like they copy pasted them from one rp to the next like while they have different experiences and looks to suit the rp their personality is the same. It kinda bugs me just because I always try to push myself to write different and unique characters like the past two we\u2019ve had I had one character who was soft spoken and more disconnected with their emotions and then the next rp mine was a loud mouthed bitchy mercenary and this current rp they\u2019re an excitable nerd. It\u2019s not enough to make me want to stop rping with X but it just sucks cause their characters personality is always the same. Anyone else have this issue with a partner?",

            "selftext": "So I was on discord looking for some RP on a server. One person posted their RP ad looking for some, so I decided to be polite and message them. Since this person had a furry profile pic, I sent them a message saying I was interested in RP and that I had a Kitsune character, but if they were looking for furries only then just let me know. Maybe it was my fault, but she seemed to have gotten irritated because she said anthro foxes count as furries too, but then asked to see my character. Maybe it\u2019s my ignorance because I don\u2019t know all of the proper terminology so I apologized. \n\nFor context, my character is basically a human with fox tail and ears, so I sent a pic bc she asked. However, she seemed to have gotten really pissed because she was like \u201cwtf you said it was a fox, that\u2019s a fucking human.\u201d So this person is getting really hostile with me, and so I apologize to them over the misunderstanding. maybe she misunderstood what I said because she then went \u201cyou said nothing about a human with fake ears and tail.\u201d I found that to be pretty rude because her ears and tail were far from fake, for the character that she was. Perhaps we both simply had different interpretations of Kitsune, but I thought the insults were unnecessary. \n\nShe then sends me pictures of what she considers kitsune, which were all furries, but I think they all came from a furry site. Not entirely sure. Then, I told her that I\u2019ve changed my mind on RPing with her because she\u2019s being very hostile over a misunderstanding and I wished her well, thinking that would be it. Nope! She proceeds to tell me:\n\n\u201cBecause i was expecting a cute fox girl and you sent a weird looking human bitch, who I\u2019m fairly certain doesn\u2019t even belong to you, but I didn\u2019t reverse image search it so I don\u2019t want to claim you stole it yet.\u201d \n\nI was appalled by how argumentative and gatekeepy this person was so I clarified that the character was actually a commission i got a few months prior. Therefore, accusing me of stealing someone else\u2019s work and implying that it doesn\u2019t belong to me was frankly rude as fuck. \n\nThis asshole tells me to learn to read because they said that she wasn\u2019t saying I stole it, but that she didn\u2019t know if I commissioned it or not. Regardless, her behavior was I think extremely out of line over a minor misunderstanding, especially because her RP ad never clarified that she was looking for furries or anything too specific. I dunno.. am I in the wrong here? It\u2019s definitely left a bad taste in my mouth and now I\u2019m afraid to DM people for RPs if they\u2019re all mean like this.",

            "selftext": "Marked as NSFW just because it had a few examples below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is something which annoys me, and I recently had it again. A classic case of being up front and telling them from minute one exactly the type of roleplays that you do, and the types that you literally do not.\n\nSo I made a post on (a)nother forum, advertising for more partners.\n\nI've got my own little section of a few roleplay discords purely for what I do, in fact.\n\nSo to add some context, yes, I majority do smut roleplays. It goes down very well. I don't do any really long term stories (I do, but I could count them on one hand.) - I roleplay with both men and women, so I don't usually have a shortage of role play partners to choose from.\n\nBut the plays I do I straight up tell everyone that they are pure smut, essentially erotic acts that can be done in one session, on the spot. (Hand in the pants for 60 minutes, acts on the spot, you get the idea!) People will often pop into my \"section\" of these discords, and request something when the need arises, and when I get back, I'd go straight into it, and perform whatever it is they want or whatever NSFW desires they're craving. I'd often be doing this a lot, and at times had a queue of people (guess that speaks for my writing talent? Short but very detailed, who'd know?) \n\nBut naturally, when doing these, you're pretty much open to assholes trying their luck. I always make it clear that I am not doing long terms, or stories, or \"carrying on\" from whatever NSFW fantasy they've just got me to do. I am also clear that I only do roleplays or group NSFW acts with people I'm familiar with or I regularly play with.\n\nBut along comes (let's call him Andrew) - like any run of the mill person I have on my contacts, he comes to me, and requests a very simple act. Takes me about 90 minutes to do. We're both happy.\n\nThe next day, he comes along, and does the same. Again, not a problem. I do have a few regular guys and girls who come to me each day. \n\nNext day, Andrew brings along someone else, (call her Jill) and demands an NSFW play which would take me all day. I politely let him know that that would take hours, and that I'm only willing to play with people I'm familiar is for more than a 1-2-1 hands on if you catch my drift.\n\nQueue the next day. Jill comes back to me, and demands the same thing Andrew did the night before. Once more, I decline. But then she starts telling me that him and her are really good at roleplay and would enjoy a sl\\*\\* to constantly do \"bad things with\". Big red line. I don't enjoy name calling like that as a whole, let alone just being casually referred to as that OOC especially.\n\nFor every single day that week, either Andrew or Jill or be messaging me, practically harassing me for this group NSFW they wanted to do, and they would seriously not give it a rest. I eventually resort to just ignoring them.\n\nAfter the second week, I begin getting \"new roleplayers\" requesting... exactly the same thing - all new Discord accounts with no history or anything like that.\n\nYes, a couple of roleplayers actually resorted to making alt accounts just to harrass me to into performing a sexual act with the both of them in their roleplay.\n\nThere's persistent, and then there's just being a dick. I wonder if Andrew and Jill ever found another girl to fulfil whatever it is they wanted to do with me. I eventually just ended up blocking them and their new alts for a few days and they finally got the hint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm all for providing an on-the-spot pleasure for men or women; it's literally the one trick this pony does arguably better than anyone I know! (And always open to new partners who can write a coherent sentence) - but seriously! Making alts to hound ONE person into something? Can't tell if it's a compliment or an insult?**",

            "selftext": " I hope this is the right place to post this - I didn't see a category for RPMods.  If you know of a better place to put this, feel free to mention it.\n\nI recently had a very, *very* bad experience with a mod on an RP site.  It was for Anne McCaffrey's Pern series (I'll call the site PernRPSite), and I'll call the mod I had this experience with Kathy.  Neither name belongs to the real site or the person I spoke to.\n\nI'm not here to vent about the experience, just to put some constructive ideas out to any existing RP mods on how to make the experience more positive for both yourself and a prospective RPer.   As such, I am only going to touch on the things that were frustrating in my experience when I have a constructive suggestion to make.\n\n**1.**    **Don't overrely on documentation.**  I get it, you write up that documentation because you get tired of answering those same questions over and over again and you want to give people a place to get the information they need to get started without you having to be 'hands on' in every case.  Just understand, the more documents you have for them to read, the more likely it is that people are going to feel overwhelmed, especially if reading is something they struggle with.  PernRPSite had more documentation to read through than any other RP site I've seen before, and Kathy left me with the impression that she expected me to have all site lore and all character creation info memorized by my 2nd day there.  I could *maybe* pull that off if I had an eidetic memory, but sadly, I don't, and the way she harped on it left me feeling fairly uncomfortable about the expectations.  I've participated in numerous documentation projects throughout my career and the sad truth is that people are never going to stop wanting a person to talk to about their concerns.  In my experience, about the best you can hope for is that some people *will* go crack open the documentation when they can't find a person.  I'm actually a person who will pore over the documentation as I create a character concept *if I can find it*.  I couldn't in this case. \n\n2.       **If you see different info on the RP site as a Mod than the users do, be aware of what things you see that they don't.**  I am not totally sure that this applied in my situation with Kathy, but it was something I wondered about.  An easy way you can check this is to create a test account with basic user permissions and log in with it.  Kathy told me that some of the information on the site was in the process of being updated and that it was not available.  I personally have no problem with that, as it suggests evolution and growth, which are positive things, but the problem came when I tried to actually view the information that Kathy suggested I look at.  There were maybe 20 links and somewhere around half of them appeared to be dead, as in, there was no link at all.  The thing I wondered about was whether Kathy was actually aware of which information was available to ordinary users, because not much of the information that actually was available to look at was useful in terms of creating a character.  \n\n3. **Keep in mind that things that may be obvious to you may not be so obvious to a newcomer and that they may need to ask some things twice.**  Kathy really blew this one as far as I'm concerned.  In the city where I live, middle school starts in 6th grade, and when I was at the end of 5th grade, we got to spend the day with a 6th grade guide at our local middle school just being shown around and learning where things were, so when we started 6th grade in the fall, we wouldn't feel so overwhelmed with all of the changes between elementary school and middle school.  It was an unabashedly positive experience that made transitioning to 6th grade pretty much a non-issue for me, because I had a good guide who didn't mind answering questions and being helpful.  Kathy would have been the 6th grade guide who screamed at you because you happened to ask the same question twice and called you stupid because you didn't instantaneously know where everything was the way she did.  She didn't literally call me stupid, but she might as well have.  She was not friendly or welcoming, and was only minimally helpful.  This left such a bad taste in my mouth, I decided I didn't even want to risk trying to talk to the other mod. \n\n4.  **Actually listen to what a person is interested in RPing**.  I am not referring here to cases where a new RPer is wanting to play something like a crossover character from another story and your site clearly states, \"No crossover characters.\"  I came in wanting to RP a healer character, specifically a character who was formally accepted into the Healer Craft. Characters of this type are very much present in Pern canon.  There were some reasons why a healercrafter specifically wasn't going to be acceptable, and Kathy kept trying to redirect me to other crafts.  I did not want to write a different craft, and Kathy was not willing to help me find a way to RP what I *was* interested in RPing.  That actually segues beautifully into my next point.\n\n5.  **Learn to see the potential in the ideas the RPer is presenting.**  Basically, this has to do with concept refinement, and I am again *not* referring to cases where the RPer is presenting things you have clearly said you won't include.  When I said I did not want to write a non-healer, I did not mean I was ONLY willing to write a member of the Healer Crafthall, I just meant I was insistent on writing a character who does healer-y things, and Anne McCaffrey's books have plenty of examples of characters who had some healing skill but were never formally trained or accepted by the Healer Crafthall.  Here are some ways that might have been possible to do a character like this:  \n\n* MC with interest in healing marries a male healer journeyman and helps out her husband with his job.  \n* MC has a traumatic experience as a child, shuts down and stops talking, gets sent to Healer Crafthall to be a drudge (menial worker), and absorbs many things about the craft.  This character could be given an ending where they never formally join the crafthall, such as marrying the healer journeyman.\n* MC with interest in healing sails with family members or other appropriate chaperone by ship, a storm comes up and the sailor who doubles as the ship's medic is washed overboard or otherwise taken out of the picture for a time, and MC has to serve as healer as best she can despite lack of formal training.\n\n6.  **Be aware that people may need help to understand the sort of character concepts you're likely to say 'yes' to.**  This is another area where I feel like Kathy kinda blew it.  I had a very clear sense of what Kathy would say 'no' to (It seemed like pretty much everything) and a very minimal idea of what she would say 'yes' to, and unfortunately, none of the few things she mentioned from the 'yes' column sounded very appealing to me to RP.  I can understand that maybe a mod doesn't want to get into the business of writing someone's character concept for them, but by the same token, an example can be useful for illustration purposes.  If in doubt whether a person might be open to hearing an example, you can always ask first.\n\n7.  **Keep in mind that people can process information in different ways.**   For example, I tend to build a character concept by starting with a general idea of what they are going to be DOing.  Once I have that hammered out, I do best by establishing specific, concrete details about the character.  Only then can I really extrapolate out to the more general concept of what a mod might be looking for.   Other people may start with certain traits of the character and then figure out what they're going to do later.  I don't believe there's a wrong way to do it as long as you end up with a usable concept, but if you are having trouble helping someone, it could be worth asking, \"What piece of this character concept are you looking to establish right now?\"  and then focus on that.  I needed Kathy to help me figure out something interesting for my character to DO, and she just wasn't able to help me to do that.  Another thing I wondered about was whether the person who wrote the documentation was more of the conceptual type and not someone who immediately thinks of including specific examples to illustrate for those who find the concrete examples more helpful than the conceptual talk.  Keeping in mind that people learn differently can inspire ways to make documents more user-friendly for a larger number of people.\n\n8.  **Remember, writing does not convey tone-of-voice or facial expression.**  And because of this, there is a chance of both mod and RPer misunderstanding each other.  One of the things that really baffled me in my conversation with Kathy is that she said she thought I was being condescending. (???)  I honestly wasn't trying to do that at all, I was just trying to help Kathy understand what I was interested in so she could better help me.  So if you think you \"heard\" a cutting comment in what someone wrote, be a little skeptical.  Don't be afraid to say something like, \"I'm not quite sure how to take what you just said.  Was it your intent to be \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" You might get a snarky comment back, but you might also have someone reply, \"Gosh, not at all!\" which can then make a positive, productive discussion a lot more likely.\n\n9.  **Working together with other mods is good, except when...**  In general, I'm a fan of mods working together.  Friendship, collaboration, and teamwork are some great possibilities that arise when that happens.  However, I can think of one case where it can be a disadvantage and it relates to number 8.  If we have Mod A and Mod B working together and they both assume the other one always interprets things that the RPers say correctly, you miss the possibility of learning that the person who Mod A thought was such a jerk is actually a pretty decent person but they and Mod A just rubbed each other the wrong way for whatever reason.  Every personality is different and sometimes letting your fellow mod try can yield far different (and more positive!) results than the ones you thought you were going to get.\n\nIf you are aware of other helpful things a mod can do, feel free to add/discuss!",

            "selftext": "Ok, so this was in a discord server from awhile ago, before I had reddit, but I just remembered this. So the rp started as a fandom rp, but as more and more oc's were added, the focus was drawn away from the actual fandom, which was fine. The rp was still lots of fun. Eventually I stopped rping there since it was kinda dead, I was going to college soon, and the main person my character interacted with left the server. So skip to months later, the rp is picking back up, and I just happen to see that the person who left had rejoined and started up rping again. So obviously, I was really excited and hopped in there as my character... only to find that my friend was now playing him. I wouldn't have had an issue with this if they had originally played that character or if my character didn't have such a close connection to the person who just joined backs character. Thing is, the person who took my character had originally played a character canon to the fandom, and had played at least 5 different oc's over the course of the rp, so it wasn't like they had no other character to play. It kinda broke out into an argument. Thankfully they gave me back my character though",

            "selftext": "Hi friends, I'm back with another tale of weird RPs that I have experienced, this time, our perp's selected name is **Tulip**!\n\nSo basically during summer vacation, I had joined a pretty chill RP. Made a character, started an open scene and someone joined -- within that scene, we decided that we liked the chemistry between the two characters and discussed further RPs with them to see where they go. Now my partner's char was pretty popular within the server, mostly because he was one of the best writers there. Tulip, apparently, had been there for two months now and her char had just recently broken up with her bF(aka her partner left the server), so she joined a scene with popular guy and *she* comes up with the conclusion that her character MUST end up with his because they're friends.\n\nBut instead of doing what most others would do and approach the player of the male character, Tulip slides into *my* DMs. Now, I don't gatekeep or 'claim' other people's characters, especially if they have only had 2 scenes with me within the time I was there and we briefly discussed their chemistry. But Tulip, without even a greeting, starts discussing my character with popular guy. I was chill with it until it took the \"If he goes out with her, then my char would be So Heartbroken.\" turn, then she proceeds to talk about how vulnerable her char is with him and how *right* they are for each other. I told her bluntly that if she wanted to ship with him so badly she should discuss it with him because I can't speak for him.\n\nTulip comes back a while later, begging me to back off from the ship, and I ask her why, and she sends me screenshots of popular guy saying that my character was *'winning'* \\-- wow, didn't even know it was a competition. In all honesty, I think he was enjoying the power he had over Tulip? I tell her that I haven't planned to ship with anyone and would rather see my char develop before I dive in and Tulip then says \"okay, I'll say that to him.\"...... Bro *what?*\n\nNext thing you know she's playing messenger between me and my partner, so I decided to text him saying that I'll just back away because it's lowkey obsessive. He agreed, shipped with her anyway. Two weeks later, he left the server and Tulip was, once again, shipless. She moved on quickly to one of my friends and asked me to talk to him for her -- basically, that charade happened again (didn't entertain it at all and basically ghosted her) until my friend and I left. Ah, the joys of discord rps.",

            "selftext": "Marked as NSFW just because it had a few examples below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is something which annoys me, and I recently had it again. A classic case of being up front and telling them from minute one exactly the type of roleplays that you do, and the types that you literally do not.\n\nSo I made a post on (a)nother forum, advertising for more partners.\n\nI've got my own little section of a few roleplay discords purely for what I do, in fact.\n\nSo to add some context, yes, I majority do smut roleplays. It goes down very well. I don't do any really long term stories (I do, but I could count them on one hand.) - I roleplay with both men and women, so I don't usually have a shortage of role play partners to choose from.\n\nBut the plays I do I straight up tell everyone that they are pure smut, essentially erotic acts that can be done in one session, on the spot. (Hand in the pants for 60 minutes, acts on the spot, you get the idea!) People will often pop into my \"section\" of these discords, and request something when the need arises, and when I get back, I'd go straight into it, and perform whatever it is they want or whatever NSFW desires they're craving. I'd often be doing this a lot, and at times had a queue of people (guess that speaks for my writing talent? Short but very detailed, who'd know?) \n\nBut naturally, when doing these, you're pretty much open to assholes trying their luck. I always make it clear that I am not doing long terms, or stories, or \"carrying on\" from whatever NSFW fantasy they've just got me to do. I am also clear that I only do roleplays or group NSFW acts with people I'm familiar with or I regularly play with.\n\nBut along comes (let's call him Andrew) - like any run of the mill person I have on my contacts, he comes to me, and requests a very simple act. Takes me about 90 minutes to do. We're both happy.\n\nThe next day, he comes along, and does the same. Again, not a problem. I do have a few regular guys and girls who come to me each day. \n\nNext day, Andrew brings along someone else, (call her Jill) and demands an NSFW play which would take me all day. I politely let him know that that would take hours, and that I'm only willing to play with people I'm familiar is for more than a 1-2-1 hands on if you catch my drift.\n\nQueue the next day. Jill comes back to me, and demands the same thing Andrew did the night before. Once more, I decline. But then she starts telling me that him and her are really good at roleplay and would enjoy a sl\\*\\* to constantly do \"bad things with\". Big red line. I don't enjoy name calling like that as a whole, let alone just being casually referred to as that OOC especially.\n\nFor every single day that week, either Andrew or Jill or be messaging me, practically harassing me for this group NSFW they wanted to do, and they would seriously not give it a rest. I eventually resort to just ignoring them.\n\nAfter the second week, I begin getting \"new roleplayers\" requesting... exactly the same thing - all new Discord accounts with no history or anything like that.\n\nYes, a couple of roleplayers actually resorted to making alt accounts just to harrass me to into performing a sexual act with the both of them in their roleplay.\n\nThere's persistent, and then there's just being a dick. I wonder if Andrew and Jill ever found another girl to fulfil whatever it is they wanted to do with me.

I told them I didn't like being called a girl and they blocked me again.

            "selftext": "Disclaimer:\n\nNone of this applies to people who actually do very questionable stuff, like sending nude pictures to you, trying to write underage characters in ERPs, ignoring their partners boundaries in drastic ways or being super rude to them. This is just communication advice when you deal with normal roleplay problems, so please keep that in mind.\n\n**There are nice ways to tell your partner that you are not interested in writing with them anymore**\n\nI often saw the sentiment that telling your partner that you want to end the roleplay or telling them that you don't want to write with them during the planning phase is very hard because it is basically telling them that their writing/characters suck.\n\nNo, telling someone that you want to end the roleplay does not have to include stuff like 'Hey, I am ending the roleplay, because your characters suck, the plot sucks and your writing style is garbage'. It also does not necessary have to mean that anything about their writing or characters is bad.\n\nA lot of stuff like this is very objective anyway, some people might like their character or that specific story, it maybe just isn't for you. Yes, there is stuff that is almost universally frowned upon (super bad grammar and spelling, characters who are copied from fandoms without telling your partner, really overpowered characters), but believe me...if people are that bad and writing for a long time, they most likely know. If you tell them 'your grammar really isn't the best', they won't cry themselves to sleep.\n\nMost experienced roleplayers know that sometimes, roleplays just don't work out for reasons that are almost impossible to fix, and many people notice in the planning phase that your ideas/ characters don't seem to work that well together.\n\nSaying something like 'I don't think our writing styles/characters are a good match, sorry, I have decided to end the roleplay' or 'this type of plot does not appeal to me, I think we are interested in different things, so I don't think it will work out.' is enough in most cases. If they insist on knowing what exactly your problem is, feel free to tell them, but you don't need to, in my opinion. \n\nYou owe them a short explanation, but not detailed roleplaying advice. If the continue to keep asking, you can still just ignore/block them.\n\n If you are afraid that people will think that you are an asshole if you tell them, they most likely will think that you are an even bigger asshole for just ghosting without any explanation.\n\n**Please make sure that your roleplaypartner...**\n\nunderstands if you tell them a problem because you want to end the roleplay because of it, or because you want them to actually change something about the plot or their character to continue roleplaying. Seriously, so many people complain that there partner didn't get the hint (that they want to end the roleplay) even though they told them that their character/plot wasn't their thing at all, and instead of getting the hint they offered to change some aspects or offered a new character/plot. \n\nIf you don't make it clear that you are basically saying 'I think that all characters you will write are not really a match for mine/your writing style isn't quite what I am looking for, I want to end the roleplay', many people will assume that you are making that effort to tell them 'hey, I really want to roleplay with you, but here is some stuff you need to change..'.  If you get annoyed by them doing this and  leave, these people will probably think 'what a weird person, I even offered them to change everything and was a good partner, why did they just leave mid conversation without saying goodbye?'\n\nVice versa, some people react to any small criticism with 'Okay, bye then, good look with your search!' because of previous experiences were mentioning any problem basically meant that partner was not interested in the roleplay anymore.\n\n**Most people don't get depressed because you...**\n\nmention small mistakes/problems with their writing style or the plot. Seriously. Normal people don't think you are an asshole because you tell them 'Hey, I have a question about your character's backstory, maybe there is something I don't get, but this part seems a little weird...' or 'Hey, there is not a lot of interactions with my characters in your posts, maybe you could include...'. This is just normal communication that is needed for a healthy roleplay.\n\n Now I am not saying that it never happens, there are sensitive people or people who overreact and insult you. If you noticed some super red flags (for example in the way they talk about their past roleplay partners, that they seem really angry with something these partners have done even though they objectively didn't do anything bad), it can be possible that your partner belongs to this group. Also, there are always people who suddenly react weird even though they never showed any signs.\n\nBut if the fear of this happening makes you want not mention that you have problems at all (until it is to late to 'safe' the roleplay) or even ghost anyone when the slightest problem occurs , I am sorry to break it to you, but maybe, you should take a step back and realize that you are projecting your past experiences on people that have nothing to do with them, while severely limiting your possibilities for finding a great roleplay.\n\n If you only get partners who throw a fit about stuff like that, tell you that now, they are deeply depressed and so on...maybe you should look for different site/group for roleplaying, because the one you are in currently is clearly toxic.\n\n**Don't pride yourself on accepting every plot/character...**\n\nwhen you spend your whole time being miserable with the roleplay after doing so.  I read some stories on here that were basically 'I noticed that their character was a personality type that I find super annoying straight away, but I did not say anything about it because I am not an asshole who makes other people change their characters' and then they continue to trash talk that specific character and how sucky they are.\n\nThis is unfair to both you and your partner.\n\nTrust me, most people will notice that something is wrong, or that you don't enjoy writing against their character or even the general plot. Yes, some people might be a little self absorbed and some even don't care if their partner is having fun. But nothing is more frustrating than clearly noticing that something is wrong, just to be hit with 'He will do' when you ask a person if they are really fine with writing against your character. Yes, I notice that you don't seem to be overjoyed. But asking multiple times if it is really, really okay for you is considered annoying. And most of the time, your partner will probably thing 'Meh, maybe this person just doesn't express is feelings much, if they say it is okay, it is probably okay.'\n\nIf you don't tell them if something is wrong, what should they do? Guess what character you like or what exactly your problem might be? You are wasting your time and also theirs.\n\n**Ask yourself if this roleplay is really better than no roleplay...**\n\nI always see people expressing that they fear that if they mention a certain boundary/tell someone that something seems a bit illogical about the plot or that they don't like such a strong focus on romance, the person will immediately leave.\n\nBut in my opinion, it is better to notice that it won't work out soon than being stuck with a horrible roleplay later on. If someone just leaves, that shows that you won't work out as roleplay partners. That isn't a bad thing. It just safes you a lot of frustration later.\n\n**Don't dump all your past frustrations with the roleplay on the other person...**\n\nif you never mentioned them before. This is a cruel thing to do, in my opinion. Some people do this after months of roleplaying and then are like 'but when I finally told them, they were sad, so clearly, my former reservations about telling them were justified'. This is just not true. If someone is thinking that a roleplay is going well for months, loving that roleplay and never encountering a problem, and suddenly their partner is like 'Oh, by the way, you don't write characters well, your writing style sucks, the roleplay is boring, I never had any fun, and now I am leaving/so now change everything about your beloved characters because I failed to mention my problems beforehand' out of the blue...seriously, almost everyone would feel saddened by that. If you never open your mouth during all this time, in my opinion it, it is better to tell them that you can't write the roleplay anymore because the spark is missing or something like that.\n\nI know that I might be alone with this, but if you never mentioned any problems before, suddenly venting your frustrations to your partner will always do more harm than good.",

            "selftext": "This was an ERP (I do half story progression/smut) this was a vampire x human RP.\n\nMy RP partner wanted me to play looking like a certain famous person cause it turns them on so I said sure. Then they asked what I wanted so I just gave them three handsome young male images and now I don\u2019t know why he bothered asking me cause he didn\u2019t use what I suggested or pick something that was even remotely close to what I asked for. I then pointed this out to him and he argued that it was a side character which first of all I don\u2019t know what someone would make a side character first before their main character and two they just wanted me to roleplay to their \u201cside\u201d character and told me it was a side character in the works. \n\nOn the character section in discord this was not labeled as a side character nor did they tell me they wanted to make a side character first beforehand so I don\u2019t know if I believe them, but anyways after we argued about it for a little bit I pointed out to him that I was playing as a character looked like an X actress or I didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t do the same thing for me. So reluctantly he changed his image to one of the three that I suggested. \n\nSo then we start the RP and he wanted me to go first which is what I do 99% of the time anyways so it was fine. So I did my response and then eventually he got back to me with his response which I thought was weird format as he would do a sentence and then space it to where there was a gap/space in between the bottoms and top part of the letters of a new sentence. I didn\u2019t complain about this and just thought maybe this is how they prefer to read it so I didn\u2019t even say anything to them I just started changing my format style to please them. \n\nAs I read what they said I started to type out my response until I came to a part where I thought it didn\u2019t make sense in my mind, but I didn\u2019t say anything to them and just decided to roll with it. What had happened is my character is a high ranking resistance member waiting on a new recruit while in the forest. The new recruit is a vampire disguised as a human with the plan of infiltrating this resistance group my character is in. Immediately the first thing out of his character\u2019s was \u201cWhat is freedom like? I want to fuck you like a bitch in heat against a tree.\u201d To me I thought that was really weird as his character is infiltrating the resistance group and in this whole vampires enslave humans sexually so why say that kind of thing to a high ranking member of a resistance. Would he want everyone to like him and get close to everyone especially those with higher positions in the group? (This is what went through my mind as I read his response, but I just thought whatever I\u2019ll just roll with it.)\n\nSo I have my character lead him to the resistance\u2019s hideout and mention that the buildings were solar powered and he tells the character that\u2019s better than the vampires that are using fossil fuels and are transitioning into nuclear. (I honestly don\u2019t know why in a futuristic setting that fossil fuels would still be used anyways and this time I said something and I pointed this out to him in OOC and told him the topic of nuclear just made me feel uncomfortable and if we could at least change that part of the story to something else.)\n\nHe said it was a fictional story and that it doesn\u2019t matter so I should be fine with nuclear, so I explained to him that kind of topic in real life and in RP just simply made me uncomfortable, but if he really wanted the vampires to use fossil fuels as an energy source it\u2019s fine. I did then suggest that the humans for solar could use silicon cells while vampires used perovskite cells (instead of nuclear) which are way more efficient than silicon and have room to grow in efficient as well which I thought would go great with a storyline set in the future. He said it didn\u2019t make sense in the Rocky Mountain kind of setting and again this was the guy who a moment ago said it should matter as it\u2019s just fiction, but then it all of a sudden mattered to him I guess. \n\nAnyways then I said it doesn\u2019t have to be solar I would just prefer a different energy resource over nuclear so I suggested Geothermal as another alternative. He would not budge at all saying it has to be nuclear and took me to start freaking out and just response back already. He told me he has been more than accommodating to me in this RP and that\u2019s when I went back to him arguing with me and being reluctant to changing his character\u2019s image at first. He said \u201cI told you it was a side character.\u201d I honestly just didn\u2019t want to argue anymore so I was just going to suggest we just remove the topic of energy resources in the RP and then he just kicked me from the discord server and I told him I was literally in the middle of typing that suggestion to him and he said, \u201cDoubt it.\u201d Then unfriended me in discord so I could no longer message him back. \n\nIt was just such a bizarre experience for me...",

I have a hazy memory of what happened so forgive me if I jump around too much.  \n\n\nSo basically as a kid I was on Amino a LOT and I had been getting into the roleplay community. One day I came across a yandere rp and my child mind decided \"Hey why not join\" so basically what happened in the rp was that my character got kidnapped by the another person's oc (we'll call the character Z) and we had just been released and were going back to school (Because that's smart :D) Z was obsessed with the owner's character (Who I will call owner) and in the rp he had just locked them both in a room together (apparently he was going to kill her). I decided to go to their location and bang on the door and yell for her to get out (because apparently I'm the main character now :D)and of course It didn't work and I cried by the door (I don't think he actually killed her though).\n\nFast forward to my second mistake where my character was sad and walking around school. I run into the owner's best friend (who's character I will name A) was looking for her best friend. She asked \"Have you seen Owner?\" And I said to put it simply \"She's dead\" and The owner told me in ooc to stop. My child mind didn't catch it so I then yelled at A about how owner was dead and it was all my fault and blah blah blah I'm EdGy AnD dEpPrEsSeD until she kicked me from the chat. I didn't know why back then but I know why now.\n\nTL;DR: I acted like I was the main character and got kicked from the chat",

Its a bit hard but I always feel like whenever I find people to roleplay with it will start out great but then gradually some of my partners will start to become passive aggressive, or talk down to me.\n\nIts been kind of hitting my self esteem pretty badly but. Lately it feels like once I connect to my partner is when they start acting up. They will compliment my art, tell me that I am a great rpyer, and that I am creative one minute. (I also of course compliment them profusely and assure them I am happy as well.) Then the next minute they go out of their way to talk down to me, or treat me like I know nothing. This doesn\u2019t happen always, but when it does I become anxious and confused mainly? Its hard to connect with partners but I don\u2019t know if I should tolerate being treated this way. I cannot tell if I am being rude and just unaware. I try to be very careful with how I approach people but as of late it seems like it happens out of the blue.\n\nI do have people who are very kind with me that I have met through roleplay but I have been trying different plots so I just look for partners but they often get really aggressive with their character archetypes, or if I try to converse about the story and characters they seem to get defensive because my character doesn\u2019t always agree with theirs. Then they defend them ooc, and I find myself stressed out.",

            "selftext": "So I am a very laid back rp partner who doesn't really care how long it takes for someone to get back to me.  As such, I tend to attract people who regularly need to take breaks or work nontraditional schedules.  After my last partner search a few months back, I ended up with four total partners.\n\nAnn was a long time partner who just posts whenever.  Hours, day, weeks.  Could be anything. Jay was from the search before last and can post multiple times a day, but only at night and they're totally cool with my usual one post a day.  Bill was new and could also post multiple times a day at any time, but also had to take a break every other week.   Amy wrote twice times a week, but will also randomly disappear for long chunks of time.\n\nSo this all worked out great until I had some health issues that left me complete exhausted (yay autoimmune disorders) which made finding the mental energy to rp difficult.  So I decided to take two weeks off and go from there.  Ann and Jay were totally fine and cool with it.  They're great.\n\nBill first said it was fine.  They had just started the week where they couldn't post anyway.  We'd pick it up the next time we were both free in 3 weeks.  The week they came back, but I still was gone, they \"forgot\" I was taking time off twice and then told me that I was a bad partner for making them wait half a month for a post.  I get not wanting to wait that long, but say that upfront.  Don't pretend to be fine and then try to guilt me into rping, especially when two of those three weeks, you'd be gone anyway.\n\nAmy said it was fine, but the next day, the server was deleted and I was blocked.  That's fine, but kind of funny because they were sort of insecure and practically begged me not to ghost them when we were planning so I always took special care to keep them updated on my post statuses.  It's always those people that do the ghosting in the end.\n\nSo, happy ending, the two weeks were up and I saw where I was at.  Still pretty exhausted (but doing much better otherwise), but only having the two partners is working out perfectly.  I just thought I'd rant a little about the experience.",

            "selftext": "I'll be honest at the forefront and say I'm the type of person that some people on this place would post about. I tend to stop responding and such because I have no real idea how to confront and talk to people about it on my own. However, when they message and ask me about it, I tend to at least be able to say how I feel, and either work it out, or more often get out of the roleplay.  \n\n\n(One main reason for the lack of confrontation is that I don't like digging on people who aren't arrogant about their competence. It's really messed up to dog on somebody for 'not being good.' When it might straight up just be a hobby they barely do.)  \n\n\nThe 'bad' in this instance is quite a lot of things.   \n\n\nOne: A character written in a set universe that doesn't fit the narrative or theme that was established prior. In this specific instance it was for something such as 'I want to play this'.  'That... physically doesn't work within the way the story describes that species and creatures.'  This cut to the person essentially saying 'Oh.' And being respectful, but leaving.  \n\n\nI don't mind someone wanting something slightly differing, but taking a pre-established concept and throwing it out the window such as the way the world functions in canon, and erasing it purely for the convenience of a 'cute' or 'fun' character is something I don't particularly enjoy.  \n\n\nTwo: People who straight up just... don't write in a way that means anything.  \n\n\nThis may be really vague, but let me clarify. Imagine that you discuss the character concepts, make them compare and contrast, foiling each other in meaningful ways. Imagine that you've spent a few hours just getting down the setting plot and story, or at least what the beginning leads to.  \n\n\nThen after about two posts, you're at a complete screeching halt. You wrote the starter, you got a decent response, you responded in kind, and then they hit you with a post... that is almost entirely reaction.  \" X feels a certain way and shows their distaste in such a statement.\" And things of that nature, not adding or responding in much more than feelings or etc.  Not asking or saying much of anything, if at all.  I understand if it's a fluff roleplay, but a roleplay meant to be serious and plot  oriented feels really awkward when you just straight up write in a way that bars it from progression towards the goal of a plot. Be it towards getting to the plot oriented content, or anything else.  It feels like you're trying to move something heavy, and the  other is barely even grasping at it. \n\nTo clarify, plot doesn't have to occur at a breakneck pace. It's... bad to rush plots too quickly, resulting in one day romance plots and etc. However, when the scene for the pair meeting for fifteen minutes and having a short discussion before walking away to establish their feelings for eachother. (Be it competitors, rivals, friends, etc.) It feels really wrong to have that last two days of roleplay because of the fact that the partner is not wanting to have scenes shortened for the sake of the roleplay not becoming stale.  (This does boil down to some degree on opinion, but I feel it's a pretty valid case of bad stuff.)  \n\n\nThree: Characters having random bouts of insane knowledge on your character.  \n\n\nThis is mainly due to the fact I've created a certain character who has a written bio, and don't feel shy about explaining certain questions people have out of character about the character. It's perfectly fine and fun to ask them. However, when we get into roleplay and your character suddenly 'discovers' or 'realizes' something within moments of meeting them, it feels like a big portion of interaction has been sucked away.   \n\n\nMy peeve isn't with 'talentless' or 'cringe' writers that try to force their kinks or etc, nor their plotless roleplay on you. I don't really condemn that as much as I do this. These are all problems I've received whilst writing with 'talented' writers. It comes from a point of frustration where it seems more of a hobby to just be creative and have fun just in the act of 'characters interact yay!' then creating a coherent story.   \n\n\nI do hope this post actually fits the sub considering it's vagueness and lack of really harping on a specific person or topic in general. I just feel these are some situations that come up really often and really hope they stop being the case.",

            "selftext": "So I'm a mod of a kaiju related roleplay server. As you would expect, it's super chaotic and thankfully for the most part it kinda managed itself. It was nicely organized and everyone was just encouraged to have fun and follow the rules\n\nIn comes the bad RPer, who I will call Eye. Eye honestly wasn't that bad at roleplaying (except for that he couldn't spell that save his fucking life) but OOC oh MY GOD was he awful. He would constantly argue over small things such as a stat being slightly off, he would tell new members that a majority of the kaiju were taken even though they were still plenty to choose from, he would spam the OOC channels constantly and would try and claim things characters that weren't part of the universe we were using. Then comes.. 2 weeks ago\n\nOur admin found out that Eye had copied our server detail for detail but didn't organize it whatsoever. We asked him what was going on and he didn't really defend himself and claimed he wanted to use an OC that he never checked in with us about (we do allow OCs) and we compromised: He would have a vote in his server and ask if they would like to merge with ours. The majority voted \"Yes\" so the merge happened and everyone was happy.. except for Eye because a few days ago we found out he made ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SERVER.. although he did kinda change the lore so eh?\n\nIdk man it's kinda petty but I feel like it was unnecessary and we probably aren't really gonna do anything about it this time because he's just gonna keep doing it. Maybe we are the bad guys here but Eye has seriously driven me crazy lmao",
