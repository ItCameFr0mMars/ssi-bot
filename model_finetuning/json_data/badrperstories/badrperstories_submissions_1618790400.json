            "selftext": "Bear with me here, RP related and apparently rejected from r/confessionstruu\n\nThis account here is a throwaway I simply do not wish for this to be associated with my main account even if the forum it occurred on is long defunct and I am now an adult. Certainly took a lot of effort trying to literally buy a stolen device to type this anonymously, I love my grandiose actions for every little thing. I have decided to reveal my story to this community. I can already predict that I will recieve many angry reactions but this cup of tea shall be spilled towards whomever wishes to listen. Before I begin, those of you who intend to read on should expect to see some potential trigger warnings, how fun!\n\nSo where do I need to start?\n\nI think I'll start with the basics here: I extort roleplayers for art, control, or personal satisfaction.\n\nThis has been going on for around 10 or so years and my father, whom is a lawyer, is partially complacent in my little scheme through carefully crafted manipulation and a victim complex that is too long to explain. I am well aware that I am either a narcissist, pathological liar, massively lucky, or held in such high regards to my dad that he was willing to overlook the fact that I initiated these conversations and built up \\*extensive\\* webs of lies in order to bring in potential victims. I always make sure they're marginalized and unlikely to appear on the news to generate too much of a fuss. Additionally I do not feel any form of remorse for the people that I have utterly crushed and stepped on to get what I want. This did happen at around the time I was receiving abuse from a family member, but it feels more like I have always had this trait.\n\nThat being said, I can easily study someone and put on an act to appeal to them in any way that I see fit, this has helped get several people in extensive trouble. It is no easy topic describe, but I believe myself to have the ability to selectively switch off my own empathy when I have something to gain.\n\nI will not go into detail about the methods or processes to reduce potential risk but it can be said that if the minor fakes being 18 or older, the blame still falls almost entirely upon the adult. Using this system as a weapon is even easier when the trials are more private because of how the legal system treats cases involving minors and \"sexting\".\n\nNot a single one of these people has escaped me, ever, this includes the small few who have seen through my manipulation. It doesn't matter if you know I'm lying, you still get sent to prison.\n\nI have personal ill will towards them but furries are particularly easy targets if you can read certain \"clues\" to predict whenever or not they will ask about your age. Even in such circumstances it is very easy to fabricate such information through simply manipulating parents into becoming unknowing puppets.\n\nMy reasoning is probably very sick by your standards, but I really don't care. This comes from pessimistic fatalism but not from the losing standpoint. My belief states that you must stomp, stabotage, lie, and manipulate others to get what you want in life. These personal desires are not going to be exposed, but it does involve something about emotional damages. The world only rewards the most ruthless people who are genuinely willing to resort to cheating the system and destroying others. Success is built almost entirely on luck, but being particularly unscrumptious while being smart about it has higher chances of getting someone far in life. Furthermore, ethics, morals, and laws are only relevant because a superior force is there to keep us in line. I whole heartedly believe that the world is nothing but hell and that the only reason we have entertainment, laws, and culture is to prevent society from having a total nihilistic breakdown.\n\nIn my eyes, it quite simply justifies any action taken to harm another being from a moral standpoint. We are all tiny specks on this earth in an endless ocean of stars, therefore there is no reason to value that life unless those with superior power attempt to persecute you for your \"wrongdoings\".\n\nNo regrets my friends because this is just how the world du\\*king works. Might makes Right, NEVER. ETHICS.",

So, imagine my shock, when I get this message. \n\n[Seriously, what the fuck?](https://preview.redd.it/th0soox40dv61.jpg?width=357&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db19d10b89f875d8fb83e444e1a5f67eb414fb0)\n\nI turned him down soon after that, only for him to comment on one of my posts from about a month ago saying \"This one\". This post was one with multiple plots, so, I replied with \"Which plot specifically were you interested in?\"\n\nI never got an answer from him. Apparently, reading what the other person wants is too difficult. So, that is my most recent experience with a Jared. Does anyone else every just laugh at this? Does anyone ever fall for these messages where they don't give two flying fucks about what *you* want?",

Sometimes, I trawl the r/ roleplay subreddit in search of a partner and I don't think I've ever had a single success story from it despite trying for three years (not constantly, ofc, just sporadically). Here's my Vent List. \n\nI connect with someone on chat. We add each other on discord, have a nice back and forth. He says \"I'll give you more details when I get home\" aaannnnd I never hear from him again.\n\nI hit someone else up on chat. This one wants a writing sample. I give her one. I don't hear anything for a week and figure that's that. Well she finally sends me something like \"I really enjoyed your writing sample, sorry I was really busy, do you still want to rp?\" And I'm like sure, hope everything's ok, here's my discord tag! Then nothing. \n\nI find someone else. We also add each other on discord. They even said they re-downloaded the app just to talk to me. I'm like okay, that's some investment, surely we'll get somewhere. We have a nice back and forth. Then they go, \"okay, I'll send you the plot details tomorrow\". They did not, in fact, send me any plot details. Nor anything else. \n\nMost recently I connect with yet another person on chat, again we have a nice back and forth, they tell me a bit of their character, and I tell them a bit of mine, and once again, they drop off the face of the earth. I can understand this one if maybe they didn't like the sound of my character, but I really didn't say much about them, literally one sentence about where they might have originated. \n\nNot to mention the amount of chats that either get one response in or are just flat out never replied to. \n\nWhat's going on here? Anyone know?? I think it's time to give up on r/ roleplay for me.",

One came in and the characters clicked pretty well. Their character initiated all the flirtation and romance. Getting close to mine and I thought the pairing was cute. It made me happy.\n\nSuddenly they became very withdrawn about the pairing. Seeming to shift the conversation to other characters whenever these two would come up. I think its because they reasonably want to give time to all characters of course. Which I respect. The hard part is it seems like it has all come to a halt about this specific pairing. So I have been very confused and hurt because I am going off intuition rather than knowing. I am afraid to ask because I often am not sure if my concerns will be received well.\n\nI am always open to new stuff and if it things get boring to change up the routine. But I feel like this character is now being pushed aside and avoided. As I mention them, they seem to change the subject or ignore that they were spoken of. So I  have considered just removing this character from the rp or finding other partners as that might find this character interesting.",

            "selftext": "So this isnt quite about a rp but it is about rp. So I use this as my sole account rn. And I had comment looking for advice for something that was unrelated to rp in a community and was massaging a person back and forth in the comments. Suddenly someone randomly just calls me out and calling me sick for my rp prompts and I was confused at first but then he said he was looking through them on a completely different communities. Like I was looking for advice irl and he suddenly calls me out on that. I like smut rp and know its abit weird but just why look at my post and then decide to call me out for no apparent reason? It was just dumb and I wanted to vent. I know this isnt a rping story but still it's like why start judging me on something I didnt ask you to look at or wasnt even talking about you know?",

            "selftext": "I know this does not belong here, but with how it's related to RP I feel like it also belongs here.  \n\n\nThis account here is a throwaway, I simply do not wish for this to be associated with my main account even if the forum it occured on is long defunct and I am now an adult. I have decided to reveal my story to this community.  I can already predict that I will recieve many angry reactions but  this cup of tea shall be spilled towards whomever wishes to listen. Before I begin, those of you who intend to read on should expect to see some potential trigger warnings, how fun!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo where do I need to start?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'll start with the basics here: I extort roleplayers for art, control, or personal satisfaction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been going on for around 10 or so years and my father, whom is a lawyer, is partially complacent in my little scheme through carefully crafted manipulation and a victim complex that is too long to explain. I am well aware that I am either a  narcissist, pathological liar, massively lucky, or held in such high regards to my dad that he was willing to overlook the fact that I initiated these conversations and built up \\*extensive\\* webs of lies in order to bring in potential victims. I always make sure they're marginalized and unlikely to appear on the news to generate too much of a fuss. Additionally I do not feel any form of remorse for the people that I have utterly crushed and stepped on to get what I want. This did happen at around the time I was recieving abuse from a family member, but it feels more like I have always had this trait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I can easily study someone and put on an act to appeal to them in any way that I see fit, this has helped get several people in extensive trouble. It is no easy topic describe, but I believe myself to have the ability to selectively switch off my own empathy when I have something to gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will not go into detail about the methods or processes to reduce potential risk but it can be said that if the minor fakes being 18 or older, the blame still falls almost entirely upon the adult. Using this system as a weapon is even easier when the trials are more private because of how the legal system treats cases involving minors and \"sexting\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a single one of these people has escaped me, ever, this includes the small few who have seen through my manipulation. It doesn't matter if you know I'm lying, you still get sent to prison. \n\nI have personal ill will towards them but furries are particularly easy targets if you can read certain \"clues\" to predict whenever or not they will ask about your age. Even in such circumstances it is very easy to fabricate such information through simply manipulating parents into becoming unknowing puppets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning is probably very sick by your standards, but I really don't care. This comes from  pessimistic fatalism but not from the losing standpoint. My belief states that you must stomp, stabotage, lie, and manipulate others to get what you want in life. These personal desires are not going to be exposed, but it does involve something about emotional damages. The world only rewards the most ruthless people who are genuinely willing to resort to cheating the system and destroying others. Success is built almost entirely on luck, but being particularly unscrumptious while being smart about it has higher chances of getting someone far in life. Furthermore, ethics, morals, and laws are only relevant because a superior force is there to keep us in line. I whole heartedly believe that the world is nothing but hell and that the only reason we have entertainment, laws, and culture is to prevent society from having a total nihilistic breakdown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my eyes, it quite simply justifies any action taken to harm another being from a moral standpoint. We are all tiny specks on this earth in an endless ocean of stars, therefore there is no reason to value that life unless those with superior power attempt to persecute you for your \"wrongdoings\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo regrets my friends because this is just how the world du\\*king works. Might makes Right, NEVER. ETHICS.  \n\n\ntl:dr; Read the title.",

It is how I process in my personal life and as the title says... *Sigh.* I need to just get it off my chest. *Note: It\u2019ll probably make very little sense. I\u2019m tired and upset still.*\n\nWell, it\u2019s (not) simple, I got really into an RP recently after hitting a block in my other two. We bonded really out of character\u2014well until last night. I\u2019ve been going through some things, and apparently they had to. Comms had dropped to a few messages between the both of us per day\u2014now, there was never a time table for RP replies. I\u2019m not sure what happened for them, but, I let my guilt of being distant and the things going on for me\u2014set me off based on feeling rushed to reply OOC. I told them I wasn\u2019t in the mood at the moment to be \u2018friendly\u2019. I just was in a sh*tty mood. And obviously the narrative spins wildly, but, it didn\u2019t at the same time? It was pretty straight forward but the again, it wasn\u2019t. They made the comment of, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t working\u201d for them anymore. I was blindsided. As it wasn\u2019t a full argument to begin with and that felt like such a jump given I had stopped what I was doing to give them my undivided attention... I wasn\u2019t trying to be hurt. So I left the server. Then they began dming. And we sort of went in circles, never really getting a point across. But, they decided again, they were done. And it hurt me, again. I flat out said I wasn\u2019t gonna beg, but then I did because everything meant a lot, but still they chose to disappear without real reason... I\u2019m at a loss.

            "selftext": "It may not be obvious to some, but roleplaying can be incredibly dangerous:\n\n* Please, please, please be wary of who you are speaking to. The fact all of this takes place online already heightens the risk of running into individuals who are not looking out for your best interest and some may go so far as to exploit it. \n* People use the excuse of writing being \"fictional\" to hide behind writing fucked up situations or to play out taboo fetishes/kinks. I know some people may say we have no right to judge other people's kinks but there is a line that crosses what would be considered inhumane. It's even worse when people actively want to add realism to such grotesque scenes. \n* People lie. Whether it be their age, gender, their interest in your post, the list goes on. It may be harder to verify the first two, but take a moment to check their profiles if needed.\n* Finding partners, writing out posts, plotting, and writing itself can be rather taxing. Partners can be abusive, you may loose self-esteem for your quality of writing, or you may not enjoy writing anymore. People deal with a lot of rejection/ghosting and it isn't healthy mentally.  \n\nThere is a way to combat all these issues, but it all has to start with self-awareness. I implore those of you who are struggling to take a step back from roleplaying or go to great lengths to ensure you feel safe. Do not make exceptions, no matter how desperate you are for a partner! There are other ways you can channel your love for writing like fanfiction or even by choosing a different medium to search for partners. \n\nStay safe out there!\n\nSincerely,\n\nA concerned citizen",

            "selftext": "I've had one particular rp that made me stop roleplaying a while after how much this person ticked me off and refused to stay on topic in a roleplay and constantly made their oc an overpowered god. \n\nSo it was my early days of roleplaying on  probably 4-5 years ago I think?  And i was very much into the Original Teen Titans. So I pop the question and ask on the main forum if anyone wants to roleplay it and sure enough someone did. They seemed very brief and serious on the matter and eager to start the rp.\n\nThey showed me their oc, and already I was unsure as this oc had ZERO faults. I can't remember exactly what they started off with but I believe it was something along the lines of a werewolf? (Very clich\u00e9 in my opinion as I've seen tons of Teen Titan werewolf and vampire ocs and this seemed very lazy, like very few ideas of what the oc was their background or what not)  \n\n\nBut i don't say anything as I don't want to be rude. So I show off my oc and in the original post, I asked it for to be oc x canon. When i asked who this person's oc's crush is, they pretty much said \"I don't know, can it be your oc?\" Again I get thrown off. I literally said in the original post it was an oc x canon, did you not read it? However I figure an oc x oc rp would do me good so I can learn about them. I then ask what canon characters did they want to be, like anyone in the Teen titans in particular. They only said one and that was Raven. Me?\n\nI had to play the whole fucking cast in the rp. And I'm sorry, but that is completely unfair. Like I get   the whole cast and characters and then you play only two characters?\n\nHowever I bite my tongue and go with it, I figure this person just needs a nudge. So I ask what kind of place they'd like to start the rp. They say they don't mind and let me choose.  I'm ok with that, I'm not normally great with starters but that day I had many ideas thankfully. \n\nI eagerly start out what I thought would be a cool opening. My oc escaping from an ugly fight, injured and trying to escape. So I wait for a reply. And instead of a reply to an rp, I get this:\n\n\"Sorry, but you have to redo that. I don't like that starter.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell gee, I'm pretty sure you said anything was ok for you. Clearly that wasn't the case. So I remain calm and try to redo it with my oc simply going to the park in a cold winter's night (At this point I really don't want to rp this anymore as I already feel this person is causing me nothing but trouble.)\n\nFinally they reply. And at first the rp goes fairly well, my oc and their oc get along, things seem ok despite them only playing two characters. But then things went problematic. Now this person was constantly changing their oc. Like, first they were a werewolf. Now they say \"Actually wait I want my oc to be a vampire now, That ok?\" \n\nI was ok with the first, but then they started to change their oc like 5 times. First it was a werewolf, now a vampire, then a Cyborg, back to vampire, then to a  fucking centaur. The nail in the coffin, was them constantly wanting to redo and redo the rp starter again and again. I was done. Like you cannot just change your oc in the middle of the rp and then want to keep redoing it over and over and give me the bulk of the replies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't handle it. I blocked the person and went about my day as this person was spamming me non stop and guilt tripping me if I didn't reply. I felt awful, but this rp made me hate roleplaying overall. I never heard from them, though a follower messaged me and asked me to unblock them. I politely told them my story and they agreed that this person was acting toxic and annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that bad rp alone I felt as if I did the wrong thing and I shared my story with my other roleplay buddies. Thankfully they took my side and agreed I did the right thing and that this person was just ruining the idea of roleplaying for everyone. Do I still feel bad? Yes. And I wish to that person that they please change, as acting like that in a roleplay only ruins the whole fun for the two of us.",

            "selftext": "Good morning/afternoon/evening to whoever reads this. I hope the day is suiting you well. I just need to vent and share this since this has been an ongoing issue for quite sometime and I don't know where to turn, or where I should go from here.   \n\n\nI've been writing since I was in high school. I have greatly improved from you average \"cringe\" writing during that time to now advanced novella. I do a mix of fandoms and original writing.  I'm constantly hungry for writing something amazing, dramatic, angsty, tear-jerking, whatever it may be.  I've posted in one particular subreddit, where I list out a ton of my ideas, and I feel like any time that I meet a new partner, we connect, we throw ideas back and forth, we get to know each other oc's,  we start writing and we get excited, and next thing you know- gone. Just, poof. Done. They don't seem interested at all. They just stop and they ghost afterwards. Mind you, these are the same people that during our discussions they explain, \"Oh yeah, you know, I reply daily.\" \"Writing is my escape! I can't wait to see what you got.\"   \n\n\nNow, I get it. I get it when life happens, work or school gets in the way, or maybe mentally you're not feeling great. I totally get it! I've been there before, but it just feels shitty, you know? Like, I put my work into responses, trying to paint out a wonderful story for both of us to enjoy, and I'm eager to see the reaction of when there's a twist in the post, something dramatic, something blood-boiling, etc. It's not hard to let me know that you're busy, or something came up- we will need to put the RP on pause. I got it, we can always come back to it! You work on whatever you got going on,  our RP ain't gonna grow legs and run away!   \n\n\nI just feel like I can't find anyone who can share that excitement of writing like I do. I don't wanna sound like a snob or anything, but I just miss getting excited when I see a response. I miss stepping away from reality and be in the world we both created for a moment. Should I just stop rping all together? Just grab up all of my ideas and write up my own stories on a website? I don't know what to do. It's the constant getting ghosted, waiting weeks to almost a month for a response, and just getting disappointed overall. Where do I go from this point?",

            "selftext": "This RP partner actually met me through this subreddit and they agreed that guy I was talking about was a prick (referring to my last post before this one). Anyways I feel this person meant well, but they didn\u2019t view their behavior as toxic. I had a gut feeling in my stomach that something was off about them, but they were nice and didn\u2019t give off a douchebag vibe like that other guy, but still something felt off about him though. All ready there seemed to be minor miscommunication between this person and myself so right then and there I should have said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work\u201d so honestly it\u2019s a venting/my bad post to be honest with you all. \n\nAnyways they wanted me to go first so I did my starter response and then I asked them in OOC \u201cAre you okay with my starter?\u201d They said it was great. After about 4 or 5 responses in I asked them if they could make a minor change to the last response they made and they came back at me listed over 10 issues not only with my latest response, but ALL responses I have done including my starter response which completely took me by surprise as I asked him directly if he was okay with my starter. I expressed to him that it would have been nice if he told me sooner and express this to me when he sees something he doesn\u2019t like/agrees with and I would have fixed it immediately. I told him to just tell me when he sees something in my latest response and I will change whatever needs to be changed.\n\nHe says there is nothing I need to fix and that we should just continue the RP, so in my mind I just didn\u2019t understand the point of listing issues/things he didn\u2019t like, but then tell me to continue anyways. At that point it just didn\u2019t make sense to even continue and I told him that he really needs to communicate with me and that we should just start over. I told him that he can let me know if there are plots he\u2019d like to do and to lead us off with a starter so at this point I just didn\u2019t comfortable doing a starter due to the lack of communication beforehand. \n\nHe said okay let\u2019s brainstorm and I said that is fine as long as he going forward agrees to communicate his thoughts after I do a response as I felt that was pretty fair. He\u2019s like \u201cYeah cause you didn\u2019t like surprises in X scene.\u201d Me: ...........that...that wasn\u2019t even the issue nor did I ever bring up X scene as an issue in the first place. It\u2019s like this guy\u2019s brain checked out and went somewhere else or he has some major listening issues I don\u2019t know. So I felt once again that I had to repeat myself again about needing clear communication and he repeated himself saying that I didn\u2019t need to change anything in my response\u2019s in the first place. \n\nAt that point it was very clear that it was impossible to work this out so I just told him directly that this isn\u2019t going to work and he\u2019s like \u201cOh you going to give up just like that? You don\u2019t even want to try?\u201d So I expressed that I felt what he viewed as communication was different from how I view it so it just wasn\u2019t going to work. He says \u201cWell isn\u2019t that the point of communicating to make things work?\u201d I told him I just simply didn\u2019t see happening. So he told me to take care have a good day, so I was about to say the same thing back before leaving the server he created for us, but then he just started saying a bunch of other things so I was simply responding to his other comments that he was making. \u201cHe\u2019s like why are you venting at me? Why do you keep talking to me then? Why don\u2019t you just leave? And so many other questions so at that point I decided to not drive myself crazy anymore so instead of taking the time to answer all those questions as well I just said, \u201cWell I thought it was better to tell you things wouldn\u2019t work out then just ghost you. Take care.\u201d Then I left his server, unfriended him on discord, and blocked him on reddit as it just felt so toxic. He\u2019s very active on this subreddit by the way so you all have been warned.",

She's become one of my favorites, almost feels like she's my kid if I'm being honest\u2014But I've always wondered if people consider her a self-insert given how much I play her over any other character. Obviously nobody cares enough to that extent, but it made me think \"Do characters that aren't self-inserts get accused of being one?\" And how often?\n\nI thought about it, and there really are a lot of accusations of a character being a self-insert and getting flack for it, but the creator never addresses it or says their a self-insert. So how many times does it actually happen?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with self-inserts, but they get a bad rep. Not all of them are overpowered or adored. In a way, all of our characters have a piece of them inserted in them. That doesn't mean we're anything like them, but it's our thoughts being poured into them.\n\nHas anyone on this subreddit ever been accused of making a self-insert? What are your thoughts on Self-Inserts or characters who resemble their owner a little too much?",

            "selftext": "Another metapost, but here is a list of red flags when I search for roleplay partners.\n\n**Their prompts include a lot of 'I' or 'You' statements.**\n\nThis isn't a blanket rule, that's just how people format posts sometimes, but I find more often than not these people are looking to play self-inserts. Seeing themselves as their character is breaking the IC/OOC divide right out of the gate for me. I generally won't RP with people who have ads like this, or who hit me up with prompts structured this way.\n\n**They only ever play with one OC they are very protective of**\n\nAgain, generally this is a symptom someone is running a self-insert. If someone only has one darling character and is not willing to even consider playing anything else, that's generally a person I stay away from RPing with.\n\n**Or they have several, with identical backstories.**\n\nThis is, again, a symptom someone is playing self-inserts and can't separate themselves from their character. Sometimes it's just that they're uncreative, but either way not a person I want to play with. This might be more of a caution than a red flag.\n\n**They play characters that have the same name that they do IRL, or they use an account that has the same name as the character**\n\nAgain, self-insert behavior. I run far the fuck away from anyone who plays a character with the same first name they have. Having a username that is the character is slightly less of a red flag, but still a red flag.\n\n**They make a lot of demands for their RP partner, but are not willing to listen to suggestions.**\n\nEvery prompt in this case usually showcases their character and their character only. They very obviously have main character syndrome.\n\n**They complain about getting ghosted constantly, before you've even begun plotting.**\n\nMight be just me, but complaining about ghosting or opening the conversation with 'I want to play but I just get ghosted all the time' is an instant turn-off for me. It makes me wonder what the person is doing that is resulting in them getting ghosted all the time.\n\n**They complain all the time, about every RP partner they have.**\n\nI get complaining. I complain a good bit myself, usually about people who respond to my ad and clearly haven't read it. If the person only ever complains about their other RP partners and never has anything good to say though, they're probably complaining about you, too.\n\n**They expect you to be their only partner, and get upset if you RP with someone else/you use the same characters with someone else.**\n\nThis is another symptom the IC/OOC divide is being crossed. RPing is not a romantic relationship, there is no 'cheating' on your RP partners. Anyone who expects this is someone I don't want to play with.\n\n**They immediately start pushing boundaries.**\n\nPeople who know me well can get me to wiggle on some boundaries a little, like topics I may not be super comfortable writing about or my reluctance to make brand new OCs. Strangers can't do this, and friends know which boundaries can and can't be flexible. If someone I JUST met is already trying to wiggle around a boundary, it's a hard red flag.\n\n**They open the conversation with 'hey' or 'want to RP?'**\n\nThere's no possible way to scream 'I didn't read the ad' louder.\n\n**They open the conversation with something completely different than what was listed in the ad.**\n\nSee above.\n\n  \n\n\nPlease add your own in the comments!",

I have a hard time finding a good place to insert it into writing, and whenever I try to describe it OOC I am either too descriptive or not descriptive enough. Also I don't know how to describe faces.\n\nSo a long time ago I decided to just draw the character, of course. And anatomy is hard if you're not used to drawing it, which I was not and still am not to an extent. (No money for commissions btw)\n\nBut I still used my reference. And I think that maybe at that time I was proud of it but looking back on it I know that It was bad. However it was still extremely rude for people to tell me that the drawing was bad. It happened in real life (when they didn't know that I was the one who drew it. It was awkward after that.) and also online with one person just saying \"That's an awful drawing\" without saying anything else.\n\nAnd you know, of course that shit hurted. And I can see how people could associate low art skills with low age but. No. Because they really don't have any relation with each other, from what I've seen anyway. And if someone does have a reference then it's sort of only to get the idea across, right? So it doesn't REALLY matter if it's amazing.\n\nAnd drawing/comissioning something yourself is probably better than stealing some random anime thing or GachaLife. Picrew is pretty good, but still.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

            "selftext": "So, on a fetish subreddit called r/bodyswap , (very niche, not everyone\u2019s favorite, especially for women like myself), there is a person casually known as the \u201cPlease Find God Guy.\u201d He got his nickname for the endings of his role plays. He enters the chats, has fun a while, and then caught in a guilt trap. He claims he isnt gay and that you need to find god. He has done this to countless people and can never be pinned down as he deletes his accounts\n\nWorst part, he isn\u2019t a troll\n\nI have talked to him about his underlying problems and have tried to help him stop his ways. I wanted him to role play normally with other people in our community. However, he is very, how do you say, curious about the female body. He definitely should check out the subreddit r/egg if you know what I mean. He asked me questions about boobs, periods, how the vagina works, what\u2019s it like having long hair. \n\nHowever, he became very attached to me and would get irate whenever I didn\u2019t talk to him for awhile. \n\nOne time we were talking at 3AM my time, (He\u2019s American and I\u2019m from Frisia so it was much earlier for him) he wanted to know if I was real or not and insisted I send him a picture immediately. You see, I told him no because I didn\u2019t want to get up and do my hair nicely and put on clothes (I like sleeping nude lol). He got all upset and paranoid and deleted his account\n\nAnother time, he came back to me with a different account and I was the fool to give him a second chance. Found out he wants to be his stepmother but that is another story. He asked me weird questions like if I would date him, kiss him, have sexual relations with him. I barely knew this guy and had no clue what he looked like so I kept saying no. This led him to freak out and demand I have sex with him or he\u2019d continue ruining other people\u2019s rps\n\nLet\u2019s just say, he still deletes his accounts and screams \u201cPlease Find God.\u201d Has anyone else found anyone remotely similar to this person or a similar experience?",

            "selftext": "This is the first time this has ever happen to me. \n\nI was talking with a guy here about rp, we move to discord, things are fine. He disappears after a few messages, it's late, understandable. He messages me the next day. \n\nFor some context the rp would be a fantasy romance. My character's story arc is a bit complex. \n\nMost rps I have with a Prince character would take place in medieval times. The middle ages. Whatever you wanna call it. This partner said : no. \n\nI was like okay, since they wanted to do modern fantasy. As long as there is a fantasy element we're good. We story build, it's going fine, life is good and then they begin to message me a few times everyday. Which is fine, life gets busy. We're still figuring out what we want to do. So it's fine. \n\nBut then he asks : \"what would be the setting?\" And I'm like... We have already said... Well, you said you wanted modern fantasy. So i asked him what modern fantasy looked like to him. He doesn't answer and asks me if i do medieval fantasy? And i remind him he said he didn't want to do that. \n\nAlmost week passes with no response so i message him. He claims to be busy I'm like cool but we start messaging back and forth again and he says \"i want to do medieval royal fantasy\" \n\nAnd i ask him what that means exactly and he says he doesn't want to do modern anymore. \n\nWe have come full circle, back to square one. \nAnything plotting we did having to do with the modern fantasy is gone since he suddenly wants to do medieval. Tbh though I was still confused. What did he mean by medieval royal fantasy. My character is a prince it would already be a royal fantasy regardless.\n\nSo i explain this to him and then bring up the fact when i asked he never explained his character and we still haven't talked about his character regardless of setting. i explain everything that's already pre-set before we add our own elements to the story. So i tell him he still needs to figure out the role of his character so we can build around them. \n\nTo which he says \" jeez no need to get mad. \" \n\nTo which i explain I'm not upset. I was just explaining the situation. And I still don't know what he meant by medieval royal fantasy since he never told me. \n\nAnd he never responded.",

Once there was a little girl called Blake, he was ten-years-old and he lived in his parents house while he went to ERP with adults on the forum. The ERP got so bad his lawyer dad went to arrest all the RPer's and the punishments for them got worse and worse so the More- government decided that best idea was to get rid of them so they set up a special room to kill them, as inhumane as possible and it worked right the machine they were using went right. And they sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of the executions he returns to ERP with the person who reads this, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. He creeps into your DM's and blackmails you slowly, by ERPing with you then calling his lawyer dad and watching you head to prison. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and he will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this chain u will see a little dildo in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or im sorry WARNING IF YOU STOP READING YOU WILL GO TO JAIL TONIGHT.
