That shit really gets on my nerves, I know you can just end the rp- which I did for some of them and they started flipping it all around saying I'm the one who lacks experience - at least I couldn't bring myself to just respond with -sleeps then wakes up up- or -sighs- every fucking time.

            "selftext": "Hey folks! So a long time ago (Several years apparently! Time flies) some friends and I created Fae'ler'on, a satirical roleplaying game. The premise is that all the characters are users on the OOC board for a shitty forum RP. We've got all kinds of eccentric characters - an inept admin with badly concealed fetishes, a bunch of nearly illiterate powergaming children, obnoxious neckbeards hitting on all the female players, pedantic nerds vandalizing the lore doc, it's been a blast.\n\nThe game died about about a year ago, but recently my friends and I were thinking it might be fun to get it rolling again, and we could use some help getting up the momentum. It seemed like the kind of thing this community would love, so to that end, I'd like to invite anyone here to [hop on and take a look](https://faeleron.freeforums.net/). We've suspended the approval process to join, so you can jump right in if you'd like. Make a whacky or annoying character and pick a fight with someone, complain about a lore thing, start an obnoxious forum game, necropost on an old thread, something like that.\n\nI grabbed [a few of my favorite threads](https://faeleron.freeforums.net/thread/114/favorite-threads?page=1&amp;scrollTo=911) so you can get a quick look at the vibe of the community.\n\nHope to see you there!",

It was their idea to have 3 characters each which may dwindle down to just 1 character each later on. Well even during the planning he kept using the wrong names for my characters and would get annoyed when I would politely correct him. I figured it was just planning and not worth the fight. Now that we have started the rp he's still doing it. We use 3rd person so he can see what my characters names are but it doesn't seem to matter. He's doing it with all three now and I just.. its taking away all immersion. Its not like the names are difficult or he's just spelling them wrong, he's using completely different names. Yet I miss spelled one thing and I got corrected. I don't know if I should try to talk to him again or not? I feel like I'm being picky but its kinda stopping me from enjoying the role.",

            "selftext": "I've had a incredible amount of RPs and meeting RPers who think that they can just override my comforts because it doesn't align with theirs 100%. This ranges from:\n\n**Ghosting**  \nI have it explicitly stated that I do not tolerate people who ghost. I cannot count the number of times I've had to end a ship after waiting two months+ for ANY sort of reply. This can be a RP reply or even a chat reply (like a \"Hey, I'm alive and still interested in the ship/RP\" is perfectly *fine*). If you lose interest or something happens, just tell me. I appreciate that 10x more.\n\n**Requiring Me to Check up on them and/or Asking me to Remind them to Reply**  \nThis goes for people who only reach out after I've reached out and probed them. Also have had a (recently) increasing number of people who are like \"I don't think I'll ever remember to reply to the RP so can you poke me each time?\" Like no. This does not respect my time, not to mention shows that you really don't care about the RP or the characters involved in it.\n\n**Making Long-Term Plans and then. . .**  \nNot to be lumped in with ghosting. Different issue. This when we plot for a long time period (like ranging 6 months to a year) and occasionally RP. And then all of a sudden, they're like \"I can't do this anymore because \\[insert long standing issue that they've known about for months/year(s)\\].\" Like, no? How about reading the part where I'm not interested in short-term RP? And they ONLY tell me this after we're so far in? If I knew this before, that they would drop the RPs on this date or after this happened, then I would have reiterated I'm not interested. If something suddenly happens and they can't focus on the RP as much anymore, that's fine. I understand that. But not for a issue/thing that they knew about before we started RPing. Also, make it clear if the issue will render them 100% unable to even just *talk* about the RP once a month or if it's something that's just gonna slow down RP replies. Because there *is* a difference.\n\n**Just not Respecting my RP/Character Comforts**  \nI have been through a lot, and I'm upfront with what I'm okay RPing and what I'm not. I've had people force me/try to manipulate me into RPing those characters/those plots. Like, just no. I used to be a doormat about it but gotten too old for that shit. And if they can't respect them, there's the (metaphorical) door.\n\n**Asking me to Draw a Ship/Their Character before I'm Comfortable**  \nI've been used just for art several times before. Like the person only cares about that I CAN draw and thinks they can pressure me to draw the ship/their oc. No. I have a hardcore rule that I just don't draw anything related to that RP/ship/etc till a *year* has passed. It used to be six months and then I kept getting ghosted (worse, they lost suddenly lost interest) after I drew one thing for them/pertaining to the ship.\n\n**Complaining my OCs are too \"Submissive\"/Introverted**  \nI have a even mix of OCs that are submissive and dominant, personality and other wise. This is explicably stated on their bio. I have their personality also clearly written on their page. If you cannot read that and be okay with it, then you should not choose that OC. And do not think for a second you can pressure or force me into changing that OC so they suit your preferences better.\n\n**Interested in the Character's Aesthetics and Not their Personality/Character Building**  \nI'm very active in the art community and this seems to be a common thing now. I've had several friends complain about it too. If someone is solely interested in my character's physical appearance *and isn't* remotely interested in that OC's backstory or personality at all, then please don't contact me. This is basically setting me up for a partner who will ghost me before the RP even starts.\n\nThis is pretty much the 2019 year to 2021. Not gonna go before that because honestly the site I was on was just shitty. \n\nAnyone have any RP site suggestions? The site I'm on doesn't seem to have my kind of audience.",

            "selftext": "So this is very much a personal preference and I\u2019m fully aware of that but it makes looking for rp partners so hard bc they allllll want romance in their roleplay. While I\u2019m not completely against it I do refuse to create plots focused around romance; if it happens naturally I\u2019m all for it but otherwise prefer it to stay out of the way. People seem to think the only interesting dynamic can be a romantic one or something bc they are all looking for it, I read someone\u2019s ad and its \u201clooking for fantasy rom\u201d or \u201csci-fi action with rom.\u201d Or \u201coc x oc/oc x cc\u201d like aaaaaaaahhhhh! I just want to have a rp that\u2019s focused on something other then two characters dating, there\u2019s so many other interesting things that can happen! Not to mention I can never promise my muse will like you, just cause they like one version of a character doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll like yours. \n\nAnother thing is people want the romance to happen so quickly, or they\u2019re expecting a fluffy sorta cute relationship with an asshole villain when said villain would be an awful bf and prolly toxic af. Like no I\u2019m not going to change fundamental traits just so that he can date you Janette. \n\nAnyway this was a dumb rant I just needed to get off my chest. Thanks for listenin Haha.

            "selftext": "So recently I\u2019ve been searching for new role play partners because I currently only have one good one. My trick to avoid wasting time is asking for writing samples because... I\u2019ve seen so many responses that don\u2019t even match my requirements. Then I have to go again, explain why I can\u2019t role play with people in the nicest way possible. Because I\u2019m not the type to ghost or block people. Anyways....\n\nIn my requirements, I always clearly state that I\u2019m looking for advanced literate and novella writers. Every single time people think that they are advanced literate and/or novella! Or confuse the two! Advanced literate is the ability to have proper grammar, spelling and DETAIL! Often times some role players assume that being advanced literate is writing like an novella, writing lengthy replies. Better yet, Advanced Literate is quality while Novella is quantity. Time and time again people confuse or think that they are advanced literate. So when these samples are sent to me, literally all I get is run on sentences with endless commas. \n\nI\u2019m like, how do you think that this is advanced literate? It\u2019s not even literate. But in the end, I end up trying to illustrate what literacy is and why I can\u2019t stand improper grammar. I\u2019m even willing to teach them but they just ignore me afterwards. So just be careful of those imposter advanced literates. I\u2019m just sort of tired of it \ud83d\ude14",

            "selftext": "This may not be the right spot for this, but I felt like ranting somewhere, and maybe some of y'all can commiserate. \n\nI'm just gonna come out and say it: I don't like Discord for roleplay.\n\nMore specifically, I don't like Discord *servers* for roleplay. \n\nGuys, how the heck do you keep track of everything? With all these endless #channels and such, I feel like I waste so much time just hunting for some tidbit of info I saw once but can't remember *where*.\n\nAnd as far as characters and their info, so far it seems to be another channel-hunt, where characters will be listed by type (vampires, fae, etc) and then you have to go browsing through them all just to remember, say, what someone's character's full name is. And if a player plays more than one character, then what? Some servers will encourage folks to change names to reflect who they play, but not all of 'em, so that gets confusing too. I'm just like, *who* are you again?\n\nAnd the fact that the roleplay all just happens on channels, but sometimes more than one scene will be going on, so everyone has to keep @ -ing each other to know what segment goes where. Not to mention for a new person, you gotta wade through, like, *every scene that ever happened* in that channel to find the latest. \n\nOh, plus there's the fact that if you just want to check out a server and see what it's like, first you gotta pass some sorta arbitrary test and submit a writing sample, verify your age, sign away your firstborn child (practically), all just to see if you like it well enough to go through the rigmarole of creating a character. So many hoops to jump through, when sometimes I like to get a feel for a place before dipping my toe in.\n\nI also really hate the fact that once you join a server, you *can't leave*. I mean, you *can*, but it seems to be the same as packing up all your toys and going off in a huff from the proverbial sandbox. Sometimes I just don't want to be bothered. It got better once I figured out how to mute the servers, but at first I was just getting pinged left and right by all the activity. Who's got *time* for that? \n\nNot to sound too much like an old fogey (back in MY day!), but I came from a background in MUSHing, which I suppose were vaguely similar to a Discord server. Except that you could build a whole grid, with all sorts of \"rooms\" that players could wander through. The rooms would all have descriptions (and I can attest, having once volunteered to describe a whole forest, that it ain't easy coming up with endless ways to describe dark, sinister woods), and *characters* would have descriptions, and you could check out their profiles and get all the info you needed: full name, history, factions, etc. You could page people, which is like DMing, and you could even have message boards, to post, say, rumors about what was happening in-game, or ads, or whatever you wanted. \n\nI never thought I'd miss those days so much, but after trying out a few group servers on Discord, I feel like the medium for roleplaying has gone downhill, and this is all compared to code that existed 20 years ago. Surely it would have improved?\n\nOr maybe there are other ways of doing group RP that *don't* involve Discord servers? I've heard about forum RP (is that what JCINK is?) and folks have also mentioned Tumblr, but my brief forays into checking those out just left me confused and overwhelmed. \n\nUgh, maybe it's true, and you can't teach an old dog (or roleplayer) new tricks.",

However, I personally don\u2019t \u2018flick the bean\u2019 as some would say. I like writing erotic roleplays because I like seeing characters I\u2019m rooting finally get intimate after so much pining and sexual tension. I don\u2019t get my rocks hard to it. I just like writing it. It\u2019s kind of like how certain VA channels will say the most sexual things while playing Minecraft. \n\nThis is where Bin comes in. \n\nBin thinks that since my character is turned on, I\u2019m turned on. \n\nI know that many roleplayers place themselves as character. I\u2019m guilty of that too. Even though some of my characters are in some way me and have some traits like me, I feel very detached from them. Cause at the end of the day, that\u2019s not truly me. But Bin wasn\u2019t seeing that. \n\nThis is where the harassment happens. He insists on \u2018calls\u2019 (this is on discord btw) to talk about the \u2018roleplay\u2019 and to \u2018get to know me better, made these god awful poems about my character and me in the lewdest manner, and worst off all asked me to \u2018cup my p-word\u2019 as I was writing my reply in a lewd scene. I told him many times that I\u2019m not interested in being \u2018dommed\u2019 in real life, but he either gas-lighted me or made me feel like crap for speaking my truth.\n\nWhen I aired out my grievances, he chalked it up to \u2018Oh. But you don\u2019t know my real intentions. I was just being nice. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re special\u2019\n\nGirls, Gays, and Theys. Please make sure you set your boundaries before you start any roleplay. If they cross that line, shut it down. Immediately. This type of behavior will not and should not be tolerated. This kind of stuff can lead to grooming. Please be mindful. \n\nThank you for your time.",

Put up a couple of posts on a couple of pages. Then the requests and message came rolling in and being new to reddit. I was smiling from ear to ear with excitement. Boy...... that\u2019s didn\u2019t last long.\n\nI wish I was over exaggerating here. But out of 34 messages, chats, comments.... I have 2 partners that have lasted and we are actually roleplaying.\n\nA list of timewasters messages....\n\nWe chat then get into details and I start to get one or two words replies. Then they stop.\n\nThem - what\u2019s your characters name.\nI reply\nThey have left the chat and removed me as a friend.\n\nDetailed and into the idea. Get started and after three messages their replies are a couple of sentences and just repeating what I said. I message them ooc. Hey can you add a little more and advance. Their reply. Sorry I\u2019m used to my partner advancing the scenes. So basically they just want me to write a story for them.\n\nBeing ghosted for telling them my ideas for my post they replied too. I don\u2019t get that one. If they didn\u2019t like the idea, why message about it.\n\nLast one, I promise. When chatting about ideas, I love to hear other people\u2019s take on my ideas. So we can make them better. But when they say no I don\u2019t have any ideas. It\u2019s depressing, it\u2019s a two way (or more) roleplay for everyone to enjoy. \n\nSorry this was longer than I thought. I just wanted to let off a little steam haha. I get it not everyone will like ideas or scenes etc... but just be honest. Don\u2019t ghost, leave, unfriend or don\u2019t seem interested. \n\nDo I ask a question now.... Erm.....\n\nLet\u2019s hear your best time waster stories :)\n\nThanks",

            "selftext": "So this is probably one of my biggest pet peeves, particularly during a long term roleplay. I notice it more from my male roleplay partners but it happens with all of them really. And I was just had the biggest instance of this, like, ever this morning, so it's quite fresh in my mind.\n\nI love detailed roleplays. I do, I love to splurge out paragraph after paragraph to paint an image in my partners mind of almost exactly what they're seeing. Especially when I write erotic stories, I want to make sure the imagery is vivid as all hell. Okay, not all the time, there are times you don't, but that's by the by.\n\nQueue this guy last night. Promises to be very detailed. Perfect! Even sent me a sample of his writing (didn't ask for it but it was a nice little read!) - and indeed I was quite impressed. So we make the story.\n\nOur first scene would consist of the two of us coming home from a tough week of work, and then getting ready, and going out to attend a party at a bar - there we would meet a cute young woman, and yadda yadda, *I'm sure you can guess where this one is going.*\n\nSo I set the scene since it was my idea. I write out a lovely opening, describing our home, a very brief recap of our lives, how long we've been together/moved in. Describe myself coming home, what's going through my mind.\n\nIt's not the level of detail he returned which angered me, but it was the insane pacing of it.\n\nHe wrote back about the same as me - about 8 paragraphs back. (I can do that on an opening message usually to set a scene)\n\nExcept... In those 8 paragraphs, he covered the entire coming home, an hour TV show we watched, all our getting ready, the leaving the house, the car trip to the bar, and suddenly, in one message, about 5 hours of \"roleplay\" time have been skipped over, and now the whole opening scene is loosely covered with no real backstory.\n\nSo I write another nice and detailed piece about the bar, my first interactions with him, getting comfortable etc.\n\nHe returns back, and in the space of 4 paragraphs, we're now four drinks in, and he's already halfway to seducing this new girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n**Basically, I know full well he was just glossing over all the bits he doesn't really want to write and wants to fast forward as quickly as possible, basically, to the NSFW stuff.**\n\n**It just really annoys me when you've set a story up and your partner seems to want to cover hours and hours, even days of \"time\" in the roleplay to skip to the bits they want to play...**\n\n**Anyone else get annoyed with this?**\n\n**And if you're someone who DOESN'T do this, then lets chat!**",

            "selftext": "Okay I have lurked, time to add my own story, I was in an RP which functioned like an urban fantasy (closest approximation Dresden Files). And it was a group RP and there was a rule that said you had to state your powers up front. \n\nBasically so no one had powers that overlapped, aka not everyone was a vampire. There was this one person, they wanted to be the smoll bean is my guess. She was a mutant, with unspecified powers ( aka someone else said they were a vampire so they couldn\u2019t say it) that was emo and drank blood but didn\u2019t like it. They didn\u2019t seem to be attached to the plot as they would say a single line of random things in \u201c\u201d and then complain that no one was listening to them. Like her character wasn\u2019t there then she expected a character who was literally across town/ country to reply to her when they weren\u2019t there. \n\nWhen she complained and you pointed out she was literally very far away, so your character probably couldn\u2019t hear it. She rewrote herself as *sitting in a corner and staring* also she wanted all of the death scenes even if she wasn\u2019t there in the RP and also was not the one dying. \nSo we would try to include her in the plot and then all of a sudden she wasn\u2019t there and heard nothing. So one of the people I was RPing with finally asked in the OOC chat for them to clarify their character. I asked them to actually stick to the plot, and also clarify if they could teleport. We both got told off by admin, because we were being mean. \n\nThe RP died a little after this because we couldn\u2019t include her and we all split. \n\nOkay, venting over.",

            "selftext": "Well, hoped I wouldn\u2019t end up here but oh well. So, started RPing on Reddit only a few months ago, largely because of the Covid and a desire to have some form of creative sexual interaction. (Long story). What I didn\u2019t know is that this would be like online dating all over again, much to my chagrin. From a cursory look over this sub it seems erotic RPs aren\u2019t looked upon with the highest of opinions but I just need to rant and get this off my chest. \n\nYou\u2019ve all heard it before but ghosting fucking sucks. Yes I\u2019m aware erotic RPs aren\u2019t the most consistent (fleeting interest, people who just get their rocks off and leave, etc) but still. If it was after a good bit of smut I could at least understand leaving (even if it is a bit rude) but bailing JUST as the RP is about to start? Or during the planning phase? Come on! If the discussion is going well, why not let it keep going? I don\u2019t get it and it\u2019s incredibly annoying that it just. Keeps. Happening. Now of course, life happens, things come up unexpectedly and they have to put things on hold. That\u2019s totally fair and I\u2019d be a hypocrite if I was judgmental over that. What sticks in my craw is when they don\u2019t just SAY that. If something comes up for me, I\u2019ll do my best to give my partner fair notice and if I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll make a point to apologize the moment I\u2019m free. I\u2019d just like the same grace given to me, is that so wrong?\n\nThat leads to my next issue: a lack of pitches and replies. Now I\u2019m not going to act like I\u2019m a master of creating intricately detailed ads and prompts, but I do my best, taking advice from others to improve it while keeping my own voice in there. But to have a prompt you put a lot of effort into, particularly if it\u2019s a more unique idea, get ignored on multiple occasions while more generalized prompts get all the attention just makes me go \u201cwhy bother?\u201d I know a more narrow or unique prompt is naturally going to get fewer replies but still, it\u2019s disheartening nonetheless, particularly when I put it out there to find like minded people and it turns out even among the dirty minded your still the outsider.\n\nLast thing that\u2019s been on my mind: lack of effort. On the off chance I get a reply to a more niche prompt, it\u2019s basically 50/50 if it\u2019ll be a partner who\u2019s going to put some effort in and make interesting contributions, or someone who just gives the barest amount of effort. I do my best to match the writing of my partners, but when it\u2019s barely a sentence with a lack of decent grammar it kinda kills the mood. Still, it gives me the unfortunate position of being in a \u201cbeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d situation. Either I wait in vain for a decent partner and ignore the low effort ones, or I bite the bullet and deal with the low effort ones in a vain hope of doing something with the idea. It makes RPing less a fun creative exercise and more just an exercise in desperation.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything. Really needed to get that off my chest and just rant about things. Hope you lot are having better luck than I am and happy hunting.",

You can't say \"It's fine, I understand your busy\" than get mad about it when the person says they'll be busy. It's just so strange to me, like how can people like this expect roleplayers to last more than a week with this kind of attitude? \n\nRoleplay literally takes so much time out of your day because most people expect a constant upkeep of a reply in a week or multiple replies in a week. That's legit the equivalent of having a job. Hell, you might as well be juggling two jobs if you're a roleplayer. You're essentially a writer for no pay. \n\nA large portion of the roleplay I do seems to primarily attract two groups: highschoolers and young adults. And both complain equally as much about all the above problems while simultaneously being apart of the problem. The only different between the two is that all the college students don't have the time to complain about it and vanish for the next few months when the fall semester hits because they're too stressed out from college to write constantly. \n\nSo what gives? Why say you're understanding when you really aren't?",

            "selftext": "While this scenario happened awhile ago, it still hit differently, and I feel like it deserves a post. There was one group I integrated myself into and honestly it was still one of my funner roleplay experiences. I kept a few people from there and we still roleplay in private groups! But that's besides the point. During the end of the group's life cycle the owner, unfortunately, started to let out some of her \"frustrations\" and a lot seemed aimed at me for some odd reason. (I was one of two admins but most people gravitated towards me because I was friendlier and the most active and in turn well liked in the little community.) And what problems do you think she had with me? Maybe I can be a bit more uptight with the bad submissions we get and be harsh when it's needed? Perhaps lead more event ideas? Advertise more as a staff member? You know anything like that? \n\nNo! The issue was that my current three characters weren't slim fit and they all had unorthodox magic. (One of my characters there had fish themed magic for example) and that was grounds to say my characters were the same and that I had some sort of weird fetish for fat people. Which was ironic because I had the most non-sexualized characters in the group and God forbid I just want to play characters that are bigger/close to my size. Or a character that isn't your standard elemental mage or edgy shadow boy with BBQ flavored family members or holy light user that can do no wrong. Naturally since a lot of people there liked me this spiraled into a big argument with the owner; everyone being on my side made the owner delete everything afterwards; that's pretty much the end of it. \n\nTLDR Thingie; While the group is dying owner attacks me because my characters are heavier set and have weird powers. Everybody disliked that.",

            "selftext": " **Behaviors of the Aggressor in a Toxic RP Partnership**\n\n1. **Double standards:** Your writing partner dislikes that you write with other people even if they write with other people themselves. Things that are okay for them are not okay for you. If you do any of these things, they will accuse you of being inconsiderate, and cruel. \n2. **Pressure:** Your writing partner monitors how frequently you post and will point out frequency lapses. They will see this as evidence that you are losing interest despite your efforts to communicate any expected post delays. You will feel undo pressure. The pressure will build over time. \n3. **Monitoring:** Your writing partner monitors who you are interacting with and will eventually voice their dislike. You will feel uncomfortable and isolate more. \n4. **Favoritism:** Your writing partner will throw this word around a lot. They will tell you that you are their favorite and expect this in return. Even if they are and you confirm this, they will frequently accuse you of having other favorites. Expressing favoritism is a downward spiral of issues.\n5. **Using \u201cDate\u201d Language to describe your writing partnership:** They might use phrases like \u201ccourting\u201d other writers for interest, or calling it \u201ccheating\u201d when you write with other writers. Or they will imply a sense of ownership over you and your writing in a way that feels more like a \u201crelationship.\u201d They might refer to your characters as \"theirs\" and become upset if you write \"their\" characters in other plots.  \n6. **Belittling:** Your partner suggests that any other writing you partakes in will never compare to writing with them. They might insult the writing of others. They will state or imply that their writing is the most interesting, or the best. It will make you feel terrible about your writing. They will question your ability to juggle more than their storyline. \n7. **Ultimatum Tactics:** Your partner will threaten to end the writing whenever they are upset or unhappy with your behaviors, such as when you search for additional storylines or other outlets for writing or using your character in different story lines. You will try to make them happy. You will make concessions to keep them happy.\n8. **Tantrums:** When experiencing push back on toxic behaviors, your partner will likely have a DM tantrum. Be prepared because in their mind you are the villain. They will disregard your request for them  to stop. They will not stop. \n9. **Guilt Trip:** Your writing partner will throw themselves a self-righteous pity party and accuse you of mistreating them: How could you be so cruel? You were their favorite! This writing meant the most. These are normal feelings. They will not understand that while it is understandable to be upset, what they do when they are upset is the main problem. Nothing you say will let them see this distinction. In fact, they will probably see anything you do as a disrespectful attack against them.\n10. **Flaunting:** Whenever the writing partnership ends, they will latch onto their new \u201cfavorite\u201d and flaunt. This is a coping strategy for them, not necessarily malicious. They might repeat behaviors 1 through 9 with their new partner. \n11. **Encore:** Periodically, they will enter your DMs to emotionally unload on you. If you want to avoid conflict, you will either ignore the DM or block them. \n12. **Did I miss any?** \n\n*And because it takes two to argue...*\n\n**Behaviors of the Non-Aggressor in a Toxic RP Partnership**\n\n1. **Accommodation:** You often make unhealthy compromises to keep your writing partner happy. \n2. **Dishonesty:** You are not completely honest with how you feel, especially if you think it will cause your writing partner to argue with you. \n3. **Excuses:** You make up excuses for their behavior or over empathize with them. Everyone feels insecure and everyone needs reassurance, you think. You forget that how someone expresses their insecurities is crucial and that to a reasonable extent you are not responsible for their feelings. \n4. **Ego-Stroking:** You like being someone\u2019s favorite. Let\u2019s be honest, it feels nice to be wanted and you want to remain in their good graces. \n5. **Failed Boundaries:** You had no clear set boundaries, or did not establish them early enough. You continued to feed or invite the aggressor's toxic behaviors. You keep accommodating, excusing, and making it your personal responsibility to keep them happy, all while enjoying the feeling of being deemed the favorite. Ultimately, it\u2019s not enough, their behaviors will eventually weigh on you. \n6. **Disconnect:** By the time you\u2019ve had enough, it\u2019s likely you still haven\u2019t been honest with your writing partner, have you? You may have let your feelings sit for too long. By the time they come out, your partner will feel blindsided. You will feel somewhat better but they will not be ready to accept the outcome. They will feel betrayed.  This will fuel their guilt tripping, their tantrums and their encore behavior. You will feel assaulted for your honesty. You may even feel like the victim and fail to forget how you also contributed to the behaviors. \n7. **Did I miss any?**\n\nThe only solution is to remove yourself from the situation. This is the best thing for both writers. \n\nPlease remember that exhibiting toxic behaviors does not necessarily mean a person is toxic. Be kind; we are all human and we all make mistakes.",

            "selftext": "This literally just happened. It's 11:22 am and I haven't gotten out of bed. \n\nLast night I put out an ad saying I wanted to chat abt rps. I can't be the only one who finds most of the fun in OOC chat and fleshing out the characters and talking about them? That's basically what my add was like. \n\nFast forward to this morning i get a discord message. It's some gal messaging me to rp. \n\nBasically this is how the conversation went down.\n\nThey say initially they're getting back into rp!\nI just say hello, cool beans, ask what's going on. \nThey say not much, I say cool and try to start a friendly chat, but they just say 'so rp'. Which is fine, just wanted to get formalities out of the way. \n\nI reiterate my post and what I'm looking for. To mainly chat about characters and help flesh out some stories, maybe write some scenes (I'm not looking for a whole rp since i have so many rn.) So i ask if they'd like to talk about characters or have ideas.\n\nThey just say sure. \n\nSo i ask again. \n\nThey explain creating characters is personal to them. I'm like cool, I'm not looking to help create one. And then they send me some Tumblr rp prompts. Your typical rich guy - exotic dancer stuff / eye candy / arm candy stuff. My first thought though is MxF because it's rich guy - girl plots. I only play mxm, as stated by my post. \n\nSo i ask them if they wanted to flesh out the prompts since i wasn't sure what they were here for. \n\nI am again hit with another sure. So i ask about what their intentions are. They say they're still booting up after waking up so I'm like okay cool np. \n\nSo they come back, they explain that we CAN flesh out the stories but not every detail. I ask what their intentions are with the rp and they tell me they want something long-term. - red flag, I'm not looking to rp as i stated. Just wanna talk about it and potentially down the lines do more? But not at the moment at all. \n\nSo then, because it was on my mind, I ask : Do you rp female characters?\n\nThis is where I messed up apparently. \n\nThey say I do. \nAnd I say, then maybe u messaged the wrong person. I was mostly saying this cause i thought maybe they misinterpreted my ad or got me confused with someone else who wanted to rp fully idk. \n\nAnd then they said, \"because i play fem characters? Oh, you're assuming I only play fem characters. Perhaps I do, good day.\" So I'm like lmao wh- so i explain to them, in the moment since i didn't see any deeper meaning. I just mentioned I think mxf is boring and wished them luck on their adventure in finding someone to rp with. \n\nAnd then they say \" I never once stated I wanted to do mxf. Good day! \"\n\nAnd I go to write : u never said u wanted to do mxm either. I was just putting pieces together. But it didn't send because BLOCKED. \n\nThere's been many a time people have come to me with their afab girl or amab girl and I'm like I do mxm. To which they change up and are like okay that's fine or oops, sorry. Some people forget what ad they answered and stuff and etc, so clarifying and asking questions about whether they're playing a female character is the usual for me. It's never gotten me blocked before though. Quite the odd occurrence.",

But like both of us are straight women and I consider it like writng a novel with erotic scenes in it, so like me and my rp partner has nothing to do with each other... But still, this made me worried, can really an adventure-angst-fluff-smut rp count as cheating?",

And they already want to spill a secret life and see the fact murder is going to happen? Because the scene built into an email sent by a burner laptop with a fake email address and no signature. The killer has never been to this town, and all of a sudden, everyone knows... \n\nI'm admitting it I might be the wrong person here, asking how in all logic, they think something happened. It's a genre and hobby I'm passionate about, so I guess it just rubs the wrong way. If your here, sorry, bud, asking how in the magic some of those things happen. This is my master's degree and a big part of my life.",
