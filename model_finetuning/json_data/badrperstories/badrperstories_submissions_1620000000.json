            "selftext": "This is something that\u2019s been on my mind. A while back I asked for advice about a new writing partner who had lots of terrible, yeetable behaviors. Like, you name it and they did it: possessive jealousy, insecurity, insulting my other writer partners, starting fights, guilting/accusation, emotional outbursts etc. They like seriously did it ALL. \n\nThe advice I received here was wonderful, btw and I am so much happier having cut those ties, but one thing still bothers me. \n\nWhen I explained my problem in gender neutral terms, many people assumed my partner was a male, when in fact, they were female. After some thought, I realized if my partner had been a male, I would\u2019ve cut ties much sooner bc I have a gf and I am naturally more on guard with male writers who start to act \u201ccreepy\u201d or unreasonably involved.\n\nI didn\u2019t see or defend myself against a lot of major red flag behaviors because I was more at ease with a female writer who had become my friend. Under the umbrella of female friendship, I tolerated a lot of emotional abuse that I feel certain would not have continued long term with a male writer. \n\nI guess this is also my PSA, it\u2019s not just male roleplayers who can become a badRP story. \n\nWomen have the same capacity to do harm and violate your boundaries. Maybe this is a big DUH moment for me, but I wish I\u2019d been more aware.\n\nBottom line? Look for the same red flags in ALL of your partners. DO NOT IGNORE THEM. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",

Because all of my rp posts have a number of things I like my rp partners to answer in the first text. Like gender of character, kinks if they want to get erotic, ref etc etc. But this person was giving a lot of one liners that weren't even that sexual so I asked if they found me on one of the sexaul subs and it turned out they found me on an rp sub. Then they asked for my ASL.\n\nThis is where shit hit the fan.\n\nI gladly gave my sex and age. Then told them my location is private until I trust the person.  In the same text I asked which rp they wanted to do.\n\nInstead of answering that they just kept pushing for my location.\n\n\"Stop being so fussy its just a location,\" they said.\n\nInstantly ignored. I am so close to saying this guys name but because or common decency I won't encroach on their privacy. \n\nMoral of this story? You are NEVER entitled to that sort of info. I understand age and sex. But location means nothing to you. Rp sights are for online rp, they're not meet up sights. And if they eventually build up to a meet up, that's to be in the privacy of your own dms. So please! Stop asking and pushing for info you have no right to, and for those who have experienced this, NEVER feel pressured to give up that info. You have no need to give up that sort of info.\n\nStay safe all x",

            "selftext": "I was in a server with what I'll call a \"coin flip\" system, where the story was a sort of \"crisis on two earths\" situation. Every four-to-six weeks we would switch from one earth to another. The story was about doppelgangers from evil earth invading the good/canon story's earth ala secret invasion. Some dopples had their cover broken, but others could stay within the ranks of the good forces to create some really intense drama. When I joined the server, it was in the midst of showing the story on the Evil Earth. It was super engaging there. Apparently, two mods took turns playing the antagonists since their characters were married and both had been separated via an event titled \"The Swap\".\n\nThe evil Earth's story was really engaging because the mod running the BBEG on that front was the owner, and as such played the antagonist in a more... long-term effects kinda way? Where they thought about everyone and how their actions could affect that story. The Evil Earth was a bureaucratic control dystopia where the military patrolled the streets and the world was an oppressed, dictator-run society. The swapped characters from the \"canon world\" were aiding the resistance of the evil earth in an attempt to help them liberate their world. It was intense because I ran the military NPC's and also played a resistance member from the canon world, wondering if our priorities were straight. If maybe our focus should be more, \"let's go home\" instead of \"let's stay and liberate their world.\" \n\nWhen we flipped back to the canon world, all the characters we played on the mirror world had to be swapped to their evil counterparts. To elaborate, if you played a canon swapped to the mirror world when you got to the canon world you had to play the mirror version. For the first few days, things were okay. We were all pretty excited to see the canon characters and everything, and the BBEG taking the reins was the other mod, so we were all pretty pumped to be a part of it. I had a lot of things to do since I was the pseudo-right hand Evil Scientist of the antagonist's side. Though things got a LITTLE bumpy because after the first few days, the BBEG's mod and I had had a few issues when the BBEG noticed my CRAZY, NO MORALS EVIL SCIENTIST getting so focused on his own experiments that he had seldom informed the BBEG of what he was doing.\n\nSo what did the Mod do? Plot with one of his enforcers to come beat up my character...  \nwithout plotting this with me....  \n... Or Even expecting me to defend myself... \n\nIn a plot, I didn't know about. \n\nI, understandably, spoke my frustrations out to the mod team and they put the BBEG's Mod in their place and reworked the plot. I proceeded to do some things for the next few weeks. The server complimenting my writing and my helping of building hype. My evil scientist was so evil that people started to come up with plots that helped unite the villain faction with the hero faction with ME as a common enemy... which I was digging!\n\nI even had the whole server hating me when I started covering my tracks by Wolverining someone's character. What I mean was that I plotted some pretty angsty stuff with a Mod's character in which I would mentally reprogram them and outfit them with the means to be an unstoppable weapon in order to not only aid the villain side in returning home, but helping this character with the means to return home. It was some INSANELY ANGSTY human experimentation type shit that the whole server was into and using as fuel to the \"North is worse than the BBEG\" fire which I was eating up. It seemed even staff was on board with this idea. So much so that the main BBEG wanted to discover this plot and do something about it. I wasn't worried though, I had spent literal IRL days plotting things with people that covered my tracks. No one knew what was happening to this character, and how I was treating them. Sure the physical trauma of the experiments induced amnesia... but that couldn't be traced back to me without proof. Proof I had covered up and hidden well. \n\nBut then the BBEG's mod said he was gonna read my victim's mind to determine the truth of my actions.\n\nand I proceeded to... not be okay with this. Apparently, this had been a power displayed before I had even joined. I wasn't okay with this because I had spent days covering up my tracks and that mind-reading ability was essentially a free excuse to meta-game and invalidated my days of IRL time covering up my actions. Some staff expressed that I didn't want my character to suffer the consequences of my actions, but I rebutted with \"I never said I didn't want to suffer the consequences of my actions, in fact, I think my character should die for his crimes, but I don't think it's okay to meta-game in order to create an excuse to punish my character.\" However, staff eventually forced me into a position where I had to be mentally re-programmed myself in order to get everyone to calm down. So my character was forced into an INSANELY-LOYAL and docile state, killing my motivation to do anything for the next few days.\n\nI didn't even want to use my secondary characters. That's how lacking my motivation was. So I just sort of spectated for the next few days and watched as the canon world's plot simply boiled down to the BBEG's mod wanting to seduce and corrupt the alter of his spouse's character so he'd have a version of his husband that he could spend the rest of his canon world-conquering days with. I thought this was stupid. If you didn't have something to do in the BBEG's plot, you had to sort of sit there with your thumb up your ass looking for ways to contribute. However, unlike the mirror world's plot, all of the canon world's stories were being told through a DM format, which made it incredibly hard to get involved in and killed motivation EVEN MORE. I tried to get involved, like really... I did. I even tried to pitch alternate concepts for characters since we'd explored established methods of genetic mutations and experimentation.\n\nThough all of those were turned down, and I just went on a hiatus while I enjoyed my vacation to New Jersey so I could clear my head of all my work and RP stress. During my vacation, the staff had pitched a plot to me. The plot consisted of another character wanting to approach my scientist about concocting a drug that could make another character suggestive of the idea of wanting to be more like the BBEG's spouse. I... said I would do my best with this plot, and stated I was ready whenever staff was. After a few days of silence between me and the people this plot had involved, I left the separate group chat used for plotting the event and continued spectating.\n\nEvery now and then I would give some IC commentary via the IC-Group chat section of the villain chat whenever something big would happen on the IC news stations, but other than that, I wasn't really involved in anything. I was still on vacation and I was just sort of waiting for people to approach me to kick off plots. I came back from my vacation to more denials at potential plots I could start to get activity going, and no plots that I was involved in kicking off. There was so much shit going on on the server and no way for me to participate because the character I played didn't really have a combat-focused power. \n\nSo with only a few days left until the swap back to the mirror world, and my motivation at an all-time low, and none of the plots I was involved with kicking off. I realized that if I hadn't fixed my canon-world problem, I would suffer it after the six weeks of playing in the mirror-world, so I left the group after staff denied all my potential compromises in order to get more active and join in on the more action/combat focused stories of the server. A few days passed of me not being on the server and several mods were trying to guilt me back into joining. I removed them after the owner blamed me for all the plots not kicking off when I never told anybody I was ready to start THEIR plots that THEY had come to ME for. \n\nSo yeah. That was fun. Great concept for a server and story, poor staff management, and plot management.",

It's a touchy subject and I don't want to misrepresent it. It frustrates me to no end how people are constantly making characters with \"PTSD\" who only have the dramatic parts of it, and only use it for attention. \n\nThey don't even have triggers most of the time. They don't have any other symptoms. All they do is have a random freak out when they think no one is paying enough attention to them. It's ridiculous and annoying.\n\nFor example, in one RP our characters were hiding in a cave to escape a blizzard outside. The scene was weird now that I'm looking back at it but,,, whatever. We were finally cooling off after a long day of arguing and having lots of tension. Then suddenly, one of the characters runs away outside into the blizzard for no reason. Then they fall facedown in the snow and *cry themselves to sleep thinking about that one time a different character pushed them when they were little.*\n\n**H u h ?**\n\nAnother horrible one was when someone was pretending to be insane. \"Insanity\" in this case was counting out of order, then screaming at someone in the room to shut up, and then crying about nothing. \n\nI just wish people would actually research PTSD and other mental illnesses before giving them to their character. It's frustrating and just straight up offensive in some cases, especially if they're only using it when it's convenient to them, such as when they want attention.",

As it was a romance RP, I settled on a character that would fit that universe and would mesh well with that character (platonically and romantically). Everything was fine until we started RPing.\n\nWe agreed on a set plot to get the characters introduced to each other. And\u2026they ignored it. After I read their reply, which was long but left me very little meat to reply to (aside from their famous character being chased around by fans), I just\u2026completely lost interest. Been through this before, not about to go through this again.\n\nStill, I reply. I give them a week to reply (RP or OOC) (I usually give two months for reference) and then\u2026just delete the server (this is in Discord). \n\nBut\u2026I have to wonder if I jumped the gun a little bit. Been through a lot of horrible RP partner experiences and it does take its toll. Also, equally wondering if my character not being a fan of their character\u2019s band/them not reacting like a regular fan was the reason why. \n\nNot upset. Just curious why, and wondering if anyone\u2019s had that happen before.

I'm completely making up this scenario btw, it's not one that actually happened but it is pretty much *how* they go. Not advertising as I just made the plot up\n\n\"Hi there, I'd love to do a superhero rp with you. I like Marvel so could we do something with that?\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, got anything in mind?\"\n\nThem: \"Not really, you?\"\n\nMe: \"We could do a continuation of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, assuming you've seen it. If not I can think something else up in a bit.\"\n\n\"Let's do that! I'd like to be Scarlet Witch and we could have her being recruited into the Avengers by Hawkeye or Tony Stark\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me, so which of us starts?\"\n\n\"You?\" They asked.\n\n\"K\" I simply respond before typing out.\n\n\"It's been a few months since Galactus attacked the earth and the Avengers have gone separate ways on account of no threat since that time. Tony Stark, Iron Man was currently on a recruitment run for new Avengers as there would always be a new threat and he wanted to be prepared. Vision, Wasp, and Hawkeye were still onboard and he was having discussion with Wolverine and Spider-Man on becoming full Avengers but they still needed more members. He was currently in Sokovia as he heard of a powerful sorceress and speedster, former acolytes of Magneto that could potentially be allies.\"\n\nThem: \\*I see Tony\\* Hi :)\n\nMe: (Um, could you fix that please? You're playing Wanda, right? And I typed a lot for you)\n\nThem: Okay (No OOC tags)\n\n\\*Wanda sees Tony and smiles\\* Hi!\n\n(End)\n\nLike I don't get it... sometimes you can fairly easy identify these people but other times it's hard. I'm sure that stuff flies on Kik since it's based around your phone entirely which for most means not a lot of words. But Discord or here(Or a forum I suppose)? \n\nAm I going to have to start interrogating about writing style? For the record I don't care if a reply is a single sentence every now and then, I can even work with that if necessary. It's the \\*smiles\\* style that drives me crazy",

Rather than one specific incident, I\u2019d like to talk about my problems as of late with doubling, on and off of Reddit. \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve actually come to enjoy doubling up in roleplays, whether it be original or fandom based. It makes me happy to collaborate and give my partner the experience they crave! \n\nUnfortunately, some people think doubling means \u201cmy roleplay is the only one the matters\u201d, and SAY they double because they can\u2019t find someone to fill their plot without saying so. It irks me when I give detailed responses... and get a small paragraph for mine. Or when they ONLY reply to theirs and leave yours to sit. \n\nI guess in conclusion, don\u2019t double up if you aren\u2019t ready to commit to the other person. In the long run, you are just wasting everyone\u2019s time involved. \n\nAnyway, I hope you have a wonderful spring day! \ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf37\ud83c\udf39",

And I come across a beautiful post from this user who seems to have some amazing ideas and expressed sadness on getting no takers. Like a Delta Emerald rp and which it what I've been looking for in Pokemon. So I message them kindly and express my eagerness for this roleplay. I get a reply and get to talking. Before it all goes downhill, when this due just straight up lied in his post. \n\nI'll censor it to the best of my ability, but I'll label this as NSFW just to be safe.\n\nSo in the post he stated OC x canon and he'd do double up. I think cool and offer to show him my oc's and say I want to do the Delta Emerald idea. Ya know what he says?\n\n\"Oh I just wanted to rp with someone to play all the Poke-girls and let my oc \\*\\*\\*\\* them\"\n\nExcuse me what? You literally made such a brilliant post about a Delta Emerald rp and then you straight up tell me you lied just so your overpowered and somehow attractive oc can sleep with every poke-girl from the anime and games?\n\nI tell this guy that isn't what I signed up for and I explain i wanted to do the Delta Emerald rp idea he had. Now you may think \"Was this an old post?\" Nope, it was from a week before I replied to it. And this guy's reaction after I told him that I wanted the rp idea he suggested in his post?\n\n\"But I want my oc to \\*\\*\\*\\* all the poke-girls\"\n\nI don't give a damn about what your oc wants and why it's all about them and why they deserve to have sex with every pokemon character in the world. You made a post where you agreed to double up and wanted a proper story, not make it all about sex and then proceed to lie to my face and just want what you want.\n\nSadly the conversation didn't go to nice places and I blocked the guy after he was acting like a brat and demanding I play every female character for him to basically let his oc sleep with and make the whole rp about\n\nLesson from this? Don't lie in your posts. Don't expect people to like you if you lie and make up a bunch of great ideas, only for them to go down the drain.",

I like to have a character that has religious trauma in their background but is still religious, there\u2019s just a lot to unpack and characters like that. And here I see a character Word for Word copied from my past work. I had to go way back into my OC descriptions actually to find this character, same exact face clean, same personality, same exact backstory. Like nothing was even changed, I immediately bring this to the attention to mods and send them screenshots of my work to show them that it\u2019s a little weird that I have the same exact character dating back to 2016 just randomly post in in this group from two days ago and I get called a liar and immediately kicked out.\n\nAmazing :)",

            "selftext": "One of my current roleplaying partners often mentions how much she dislikes aspects in the roleplays she is writing at the moment. Not to ask for advice on how to mention these aspects to her roleplay partner or say something like 'I think I am being ghosted again', this stuff I would understand. \n\nBut things like:\n\n\\-complaining that a partner gives her basically nothing to react to and she hates aspects about their character...but then she says that she isn't the type to tell others what to write and she will not mention it to them even though she clearly dislikes it\n\n\\-saying how much better it is to write a book than to write a roleplay\n\n\\-mentioning how much she dislikes certain storylines but again, not telling the person that she dislikes it\n\n\\-complaining how storylines in other roleplays are not moving fast enough and she is bored (again, not saying anything to the other person involved)\n\nThese are always roleplays she is currently writing, not old horror stories she shares for fun or to illustrate what she dislikes. She never mentions her problems to her roleplaypartners. A lot of times these problems are not general problems (like a person emotionally abusive or rude) but stuff that is just based on preferences (someone who does not like action very much/someone who writes different characters from what she envisioned). This behavior makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI myself am pretty interested in honest communication. That means, if someone truly does not like aspects of my writing or is bored, I always hope they will mention it and we can either work on it or decide that our preferences don't match and it is better to end the roleplay.\n\nHer behavior makes me worry that she is not on the same page when it comes to this. If I ask her if my writing/character is alright, she always says 'of course, no worries'. But her behavior makes me doubt if she would say something, even if something is clearly wrong.\n\nIs this a red flag, how would you bring this up to a roleplaying partner?",

Even after being an absolute jerk to us, saying they felt awful, they still did this to me\n\nIt was just an MLP RP, we had some cannon, some non-cannon characters. I made them split the mane six with me evenly, otherwise I\u2019d be playing all 6, Princess Luna and my OC, while she\u2019d just be playing her OC, and Celestia.\n\nAlready off to a great start, right? After finally getting into the plot, it turned lewd immediately (which, I was fine with at the time, I said it was) it went well up until one of the scenes turned to rape (something that I was NOT okay with) between some characters besides our OC\u2019s, I immediately went and had a breakdown, \u201caccidentally\u201d leaving the chat. Later on I came back and said I had broken down for another reason, so we started another RP, attempting to now, force our OC\u2019s to become lewded. \n\nFrom the beginning I said I didn\u2019t want her to (ignored) the character expressed they did not want to (ignored) they attempted to say they didn\u2019t want to be impregnated (ignored) and finally I stopped responding to the RP, and lied, telling them I was thinking of tossing the OC aside because I couldn\u2019t use her anywhere. \nThey didn\u2019t push, and later on I asked if they wanted to rp again (didn\u2019t have a set fandom/plot) they said sure, they\u2019d be down to erp. I said I didn\u2019t want to erp, but if they wanted to rp I\u2019m down for anything.\n\nThey have basically refused to rp with me since I don\u2019t want to erp with them. I was attempting to support them trying to start up their twitch streaming career, but stopped donating. Mostly out of spite, but also because I had a monthly budget of spending money, and sometimes didn\u2019t have enough for my usual $5.\n\nI\u2019m sick of feeling like I\u2019m being mean to them, I\u2019m sick of feeling like they\u2019re being mean to me, who\u2019s in the wrong here? I\u2019ll accept whatever answer I get because I literally can\u2019t tell anymore. Am I being a jerk by not erping with them and being petty about it?",

I'm just curious if something like this has happened to anyone else.\n\nSo, the main platform I roleplay on is Amino (say what you will, but I've managed to find some really great partners on there), and one of the first things I tend to post when I join a roleplay based community is my rules - nothing too strict, just my literacy, fandoms I roleplay, plus a few other things. A few days ago, I decided to update my rules by adjusting the layout, I like to keep it simple and easy to read.\n\nNot too long after I had done this, someone invited me to chat, and I indulged, since I didn't have anything better to do. Now, in my bio on all these roleplay based communities, I state that one should read my rules before asking me to roleplay. Clearly, some people think ignoring that will work. It doesn't, purely from their initial message I can tell they haven't done so, and I ask them to do so anyways.\n\nAnd, that's just what I did with this person: they simply asked to roleplay, and I told them to read my rules. A little time passed before they replied, saying they did and that my rules were fine. I thanked them, before asking if they have any specific plot ideas in mind.\n\nThey say yes, then proceed to ask if I can play an underground fighter.\n\nNow, anyone who looks at the fandoms that I roleplay, as well as the ocs I have already posted (granted, I do only have two posted at the moment, but I have a few more characters in the works), it's pretty clear the types of characters I play as.\n\nI reply, and tell him I don't make those types of characters. He then asks if I can play a female spy, again, another type of character I do not make, neither of which I would ever remotely be interested in creating.\n\nWhen it comes to turning potential roleplayers down, I tend to be a wuss, tending to agree to plots that don't really interest me, that wasn't the case in this conversation, though. \n\nI told him; \"Thank you for your interest, but I don't think it will work out as you are asking for characters that I don't play as.\" then I left the chat, and I haven't heard from him since. I'm glad that in this instance, I stood my ground, and didn't end up playing a character that I wasn't interested in.\n\nMy question to you is, have you ever had a potential partner ask you to play a character type you don't have interest in playing?\n\nThank you for reading and I look forward to reading your stories in the comments!",

A few days ago I asked if they wanted to RP in the world and only one replied, saying no, while everyone else ignored. \n\nTo be honest, it feels really bad. This character is very special to me and I really really want to have that special thing where you just mess around with your OCs together, but I'm either rejected or ignored completely. The last time someone was interested was last year, and our RP died out very quickly and we both lost interest after that. \n\nIt's just lonely to not have that nice bond with your characters and it hurts to be ignored so much",

Began to make a bunch of roleplay request posts every other hour of the day(none of which no one was responding to lmao). This is such a dick fucking move and I've had sm encounters like this before and I'm tired of it. I understand if my rp style isnt suitable with yours and you may not like it but at least if you lost interest you could just fucking tell me and not just straight up leave me hanging ?

At first, he was extremely respectful and constantly made sure I was comfortable with anything we were doing. However, throughout the past two weeks, he's been less respectful about my time and wellbeing. Here is a shortened example of our conversation. \n\nHim: Good morning\n\nMe: Morning\n\nHim: how are you? \n\nMe: Not good, I got diagnosed with the flu. \n\nHim: aww, poor thing. Anything I can do? \n\nMe: I just need to get some sleep. \n\nHim: Aw, maybe roleplay will help you feel better\n\nMe: I really just need to sleep, my head is hurting and this fever isn't doing me any favors.\n\nHim: Are you sure? I'd really like to imagine -insert something extremely lewd and sexual he'd like to do to me- \n\nHe does this at least four times a week. No, I don't always have the flu, but I have lots of medical issues and I'm sick often. I made this VERY clear when we met. I made sure he understood so there wouldn't be any issues like this. But nope-- he's gotta make sexual comments 24/7. Yep- because I totally want to hear how he'd love to stick his business down my throat when I can't even keep water down. \nI don't know how to get him to stop. I've had no luck finding good roleplay partners so I'm afraid to say the wrong thing and upset him. I get that sounds desperate but I've been in a hole lately and feeling extremely lonely so I'm just afraid to lose another roleplay partner after looking for so long.",

I just have not been able to confront this person as even though they display some habits of self-absorbed behavior, they also are very down on themselves. It has made me a bit reluctant to come forward even though I know its either I will have to or just try to move past it.\n\nI am sure some others have dealt with someone who is like this, but I have just been dealing with someone who constantly makes every roleplay scenario and HC conversation about their characters. They will either outright ignore anything I mention about my character, or turn a fact I gave about my OC into a way to talk about their own. Generally I have just stopped trying to even talk about OCs unless it is in roleplay. However I feel I cannot build with them. It is also one specific character that they constantly mentioned. A female character they have made who seems to have a vast array of talents, and is the perfect blend of sporty, casual, and refined.  \n\n\nThey enjoy the roleplay but I know maybe the problem lies with me in the end. I don't know if I can keep feeling this constant dismissiveness towards me and my own story/ocs. I just an certain that coming forward will ultimately hurt them. I don't want to make them feel bad, but I just can't deal with this anymore. It has been draining mentally and making me question if maybe I have done something to make this like a competition.",
