As a result we have to figure it out by ourselves and make single handed decisions, which is not fun.\n\nThe reason of this miscommunication is probably the same fear OP of the referenced post covered excellently.\n\nBut the real question is, how to make the two categories of RPers to actually meet each other in the middle?\n\nHow I can make sure, that when I tell my partner they can be honest with me, they know that I actually mean it, and not going to go back on my word?",

            "selftext": "It is because, 9 times out of 10, when I tell my partner I dislike an idea they've put forth, or suggest a change to the setting, they act deeply offended.  I've always tried to be tactful, polite, or phrase my critiques in a lighthearted joking way, but it's never enough for these people. A few highlights:\n\n* After asking my partner if we could rework the magic system so that mages were less powerful (Because **I** was going to be playing a mage character soon and dislike playing OP characters - this had no effect on her current character) she said she would think about it, and the next day told me she had a *panic attack* because I asked her this. \n\n* A few days into a new RP my partner asked me if I had any feedback.  I admitted that I was having a hard time finding IC motivation for my character to be around his because of how rude his character was being towards mine.  He pulled the \"I guess this won't work out then\" card and ended the RP on the spot.\n\nThe most recent one though really takes the cake.  I had just met a new RP partner and we were planning a sort of elaborate Game of Thrones type story with politics and war.  The nation he invented had a well developed army, and he mentioned them being at war with \"barbarians.\"  I asked if we could do something more realistic.  I said that I thought half-naked warriors probably wouldn't throw themselves at men in plate armor and if they did, they'd be quickly wiped out.\n\nHe immediately accused me of mocking him and then told me it wouldn't work out.  All because I dared have an opinion that wasn't favorable toward one aspect of the world we were planning, when up to that point we'd both been enthusiastic and agreeable about everything else.  But because I was honest about something I didn't like, the entire RP is trashed.\n\nSo yeah. If you ever wonder why roleplayers can seem hesitant to voice their concerns?  It's because I constantly have to weigh whether letting my partner know I'm not enjoying something is worth the risk of losing the entire RP.",

            "selftext": "Stop me if you've heard this one before.\n\n*\"You don't get as much freedom with the abilities of your character because your character isn't integral to the plot.\"*\n\nRight? We've all been here before, haven't we? I wrote a story about this server [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/n71w21/sever_mod_made_the_group_story_one_big_corruption/), but it's time for the follow-up, which ends with me getting a big fat ban after I call out the staff for having the biggest bit of Main Character Syndrome I've ever seen in my life. So this server is the same coin flip system, in which every six weeks the plot switches over to one of two worlds. One based on the anime/manga this world came from, and the other that's an alternate \"darkest timeline/days of future past/bureaucratic control \" world where people are oppressed and the ruler of the world lives comfortably at the top of it. Whatever.\n\nNow, the story got a bit CONFUSING in some places, but basically how it worked was that it was sort of an invasion of the doppelgangers type story. You applied for whether you wanted to play the canon version of the character or their \"mirror\" version. Whenever we swapped back to the evil world, we would see the flipped version of whoever you applied for. This is where things get tricky for me because the plot moves fast and its whole linchpin is the relationship of the owner's character and his girlfriend's character, who are married in the evil world and rule it. If your character isn't directly intertwined in that relationship, whether you're from the mirror world, friends with one of the owner's Auxillary characters, or have a direct relationship to their character... you're probably not gonna be getting much activity. This is something I suffered from. My scientist had a LOT of activity because he performed modification surgery on one of the owner's auxiliary characters, so I got activity with him all the time. The problem was that he was an EXTREMELY toxic character and was growing into a more hated character than the ACTUAL BBEG, which was the Owner's girlfriend. In my first story, I go over this more in-depth. \n\nI then tried to find another solution to this problem. One of them was seeing if OC's could get added to the server in an attempt to give me and anyone else suffering more creative freedom. This was the pitch. However, the owner said that \"CANON AND OC\" interactions irked them (Even though the mirror versions of the canons were so RADICALLY different from the canon characters that they were basically OC's but go off). So my next solution was to try and see if I could alter a canon character's power set (to something more thematically fitting and more something I'm familiar with so that I can write with a kit I'm comfortable and experienced using) using pre-established methods set up by my scientist character WEEKS ago and even tested on the Owner's character. My excuse was that the Scientist had selected this character (who'd be one of my Aux. Characters) to use as a prototype for the experiments they would later on the Owner's character. The owner shot that down, but at the time it wasn't AS FLESHED out. Regardless, I ended up leaving because the stress got to me too much.\n\nI was gone for a DAY before the owner blamed me for my drop in motivation and the stress I had on my shoulders. They pitched a ton of plot ideas on me while I had been on vacation and told me that I hadn't told them I was ready for the PLOT IDEAS INVOLVING THEIR CHARACTER PLOTTED BY THEM AND PITCHED TO ME. I was apparently supposed to tell the owner I was READY to write the thread involving THEIR plot. They didn't think of coming to me and asking me if I was ready. So I removed the owner. Three days later, I felt bad and added the owner back. I apologized, knew that dropping the scientist character and leaving abruptly might've been a blow to the plot. I offered to pick the scientist up immediately if I could apply for a secondary character. I pitched a more fleshed-out version of the power swap ability, and once again that was shot down. I wasn't told why (Don't worry I'll get to the point soon). \n\nI was told to apply for the scientist again and that in three weeks I could apply for the secondary character. I said that I would rather pick up the secondary character first if that was the case because they were younger and more action-oriented and could move as quickly as the plot allowed it. Apparently, the owner didn't tell the mod staff that I had offered to pick up the scientist again immediately, I mention this now. Remember that! We'll come back to it. I'm on the server for about maybe... 12 hours? Without incident? Plotting threads, having fun, making people laugh. I figure if I move at this consistent pace I'll get back to good ole' times in no time flat. Though I fucked up by deciding to message the owner's gf, who was a multi-shipper, and that we had had plans to ship with me! So I figured I should try and message them and get a conversation going.\n\nPlease note I was off the server for a total of FIVE DAYS (give or take).\n\nWhat starts as a conversation about OC's quickly delves into my ideas for power swapping. The owner's girlfriend begins to get on my case because The canon character I picked up was a secondary character, and the characters I had cited in an example of other methods of power swapping displayed by staff characters in the server were INTEGRAL to the plot, and MY CHARACTER and as well as OTHERS who weren't receiving power boots were NOT receiving boots because THEIR characters weren't INTEGRAL TO THE PLOT/THEY WERE NOT MAIN CHARACTERS. In but a few words, the Owner's girlfriend FULLY devaluates EVERYONE'S efforts, plots, relationships, roleplay moments, and any ideas they could have in the future because they're \"BACKGROUND characters\". \n\nThe owner's girlfriend told me my scientist was integral and that staff had had a NIGHTMARE picking the pieces up of what I had left behind, and that they were disappointed when I TOLD THE OWNER THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO PICK HIM BACK UP, which was UNTRUE and I explained that I had even offered to pick things back up, and I questioned why the staff didn't ask me to pick him back up as soon as I got back, or why they didn't ask me to plot things with them even without the character so things could get straightened back to order. I offered to pick my scientist character up TWICE but wanted a secondary character who I could use to get integrated into things quickly. We argue for a bit and they make stupid points about how one of the owner's characters can get a brand new power because they're the BBEG's husband IC and the BBEG gets to read minds because they're the BBEG, and one of the mod's villains can take and give powers because they're essential to the plot, etc., etc.\n\nThey end the argument with the good ole, \"I have better shit to do. We're still friends, you can stay on the server, but stop begging for power alterations. It's not going to happen. You're annoying all of us and you're causing more stress on yourself because you want a power change.\" and then they put in fake compliments to make me feel like the friendship wasn't over.\n\nand then the owner banned me five minutes later for harassment. \n\n*\"I'm sorry (me), for the way you have behaved towards the mods and by harassing unrelated players with issues that did not pertain to them, disrespecting the server's rules, and questioning the moderation's decisions over and over, and as for previous happenstances, we understand now that TTLG Is not the RP for you. You refused to listen to the moderation repeatedly when told 'no' and wanted to discuss things that were not up to debate. We thank you for taking your time to write with us but we have exhausted our patience and communication means, finding it hard to remain civil when you clearly are not interested in simply writing with us, but challenging things that were never open for discussion in the first place. We also kindly ask you to keep from harassing the other players with your shit, they are also not interested.\"*\n\nLmao, what a fucking clown show.",

I don't expect a character-driven story to be cushy and inoffensive 100% of the time, you know? It's only made worse by the fact that every blacklist contains extremely mundane things... like, sorry but no, you're not going to have a PTSD episode from hearing about High School Musical or from someone talking about asparagus.\n\nI could overlook this if it were localized to a few servers, but the issue I've been having is, for a certain few fandoms, I literally cannot find a group rp server without one. About nineteen out of twenty servers had an extensive blacklist last time I searched. Naturally, if you disagree with any implementation of it you're immediately thrown out and labelled as this and that.\n\nBut maybe I need to find a new website to search, since a lot of these servers  seem to originate from Tumblr. What's a good platform to find groups on?",

My bad.\n\nFor starters, I'm the kind of RPer who doesn't try to be pushy with things, if you want to remove my character from the scene, sure go ahead, if your character is a literal god amongst men, go ahead. But one thing that irks me is when people just kill my character. But that's mostly my fault. You see, I don't really have much of a backbone. This means I have lots of trouble trying to do fightimg roleplay, it's hard to think of a way to fight back without ending up as that overpowered character who always has a solution to everything. \n\nI do this because I don't want to seem OP yk, but it's really unfun and I bet it's boring to roleplay with. For example, I had a character with super strength and they were being choked out by a crazy werewolf guy, if you were in that situation you'd use your strength to push them back right? I didn't do that because I felt I'd be too op, I ended up just dying when I could've easily done something. This became a recurring theme with my characters where they would just randomly kill them as a joke (I didn't find it funny...) one time I had a character and they had gotten their legs slashed off by a guy who came out of the sky because they apparently had a \"disease\" that would kill them if they didn't do so. My character was allowed to live so I kind of had to roleplay being crippled for a while. A different OC had been a servant of the Co-owners crazy OP MC that had every type of hax and my character, who was supposed to be incredibly fast, was just randomly insta killed in a fight they weren't even participating in.\n\nThis all sounds like THEY'RE the bad role players, but really it's my fault. I should've shared my dislike of them killing my characters, and I should actually use my powers when I need to in a roleplay. Not doing so made me a target to them and that's really my fault. But I'm just not that good at fighting roleplays. So THAT'S why I'm often killed off for fun. This post is more about myself being stupid and making myself a target to that kind of stuff. And I don't really know how to end this but. My bad..?",

It was a Marvel roleplay where we would each be playing our own ocs and their respective canon love interests. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that she has actually never seen a single movie portraying my OC\u2019s love interest (Cap), so any attempt at referencing something from canon backstory would go right over her head. Because she had no idea how to play him properly, she basically spent the entire roleplay having him take everything my OC said out of context (because she had no knowledge of the films to know what I was talking about), immediately falling head over heels for my OC, and blushing.\n\nThere were some other issues I could bring up, but that\u2019s really not the main focus.\n\nAfter a few days of this, I told her that I didn\u2019t think I would be roleplaying with her anymore because some major things came up in my personal life and I\u2019ve become unexpectedly busy\u2014which, for the record, wasn\u2019t a lie. Instead of accepting this, she started interrogating me on my schedule and asking me to break down every second of every day so she could help me find time to roleplay with her. I told her that I was sorry, but even if I had gaps of free time here and there, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have the energy to roleplay anyways. I thought the situation was over after that. \n\nShe\u2019s started messaging me every morning on Instagram to ask me if I was free to roleplay. I mean, every morning. I always said no, but if I didn\u2019t respond to her in a timely manner, I\u2019d find a passive aggressive post on her Instagram stories complaining about someone ignoring her DMs. If she saw that I had reposted something onto my stories or liked something, she would message me within minutes to ask me if I was free to roleplay. At some point, I didn\u2019t message her back for an entire day, and she posted paragraphs upon paragraphs on her stories, just ranting about how she doesn\u2019t appreciate being ignored\u2014which I responded by telling her bluntly: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to roleplay. I\u2019m not feeling it, and I\u2019m not sure when I will be feeling it. It\u2019s best that you just find another partner.\u201d The messages persisted, unfortunately. Honestly, my mistake was adding her on Instagram, but she seemed perfectly normal at the time, and we had art of our OCs we wanted to show each other. \n\nWhen she realized I wasn\u2019t responding to Instagram DMs and was no longer logging into Skype (which was where we roleplayed), she managed to find me through other platforms to ask me how I was doing and if I\u2019ve managed to find the time or desire to roleplay. She\u2019s even gone into the comment section of one of my old fanfics, likely out of sheer desperation. This creeped me out enough that I\u2019ve finally decided to block her, which is something I should\u2019ve done a while ago, but I suppose I wrongly assumed she would eventually get the hint.",

It's usually like \"You're my first friend\" or some love at first sight type thing.\n\nAnother thing I actually hate is when people create a character for the sole purpose of them dating. It takes away so much from a character when their only struggle and goal in life is to date someone. They always act depressed and sad because of not having a character to date. This is mostly the result of the player being really eager to have a boyfriend so they just experience it through roleplay self inserts instead.\n\nThese types of characters always have the same traits. Shy, hates being around people, depressed, anxiety, and like music. Basically just an attempt to be cute more often than not. Most mental illnesses in roleplays are used just to draw attention to the character and not played accurately anyway.\n\nThat's pretty much the end of my rant, roleplay relationships never actually have real chemistry, and they would've gone with any other person if they were the first to interact.",

Some nights, it\u2019s like pulling out teeth, and because no one in my friend group rps, I can\u2019t vent about it to anyone. \n\nI\u2019m always the one who initiates any sort of plot. She will rely on me for everything, and on the nights where I\u2019ve intentionally done nothing to see what she would do, it will be the most boring, mundane situations with nearly the exact same series of painful dialogue. \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m good, how have you been?\u201d \u201cGood. So what have you been up to today?\u201d Every night. Every damn night\u2014just small talk. \n\nIn addition, There have also been times where she has spent the entire session just describing her oc eating various foods on her place, and reacting to how flavourful the food is or how much she approves or disapproves of the spices. And if she really wants to spice it up, she will ask my character, \u201chow is your food?\u201d Groundbreaking. \n\nAll of her ocs have the exact same personality, regardless of which fandom we switch to. They\u2019re always ridiculously beautiful, to the point where every man and women acknowledges her appearance to some extent or another\u2014they\u2019re the kindest, most loving characters\u2014\u201cnot like all the other girl\u201d types. \n\nAt first, I assumed she was perhaps bored with rping, so naturally, I asked her about it. It turns out she not only enjoys the rps, but I\u2019ve been her favourite rp partner. God, help me. \n\nSomeone please tell me I\u2019m not alone.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, Reddit! I've posted other stories and rants before on this sub, so here is a new one from way back in the day. If you read the title, this rant is going to be about someone who emotionally manipulated me and my friends by using pathological lying and DARVO techniques. I'll call this person Jill. \n\nJill started off a bit weird when I first met her on a roleplaying site, as she was running a forum and lowkey trying to put me to the side. I knew I should've just left then, but I decided to confront her about it. She relented and we started getting along for a while. I invited my friends and we all hit it off. \n\nNow we are introduced to Jake (fake name), who was already a part of Jill's group. Jill had claimed that Jake was her boyfriend and they had lived a few hours away from each other. I didn't think too much into it, but this is going to be important. \n\nJake had later done something to my character which made me uncomfortable, so I voiced my concerns towards Jake. He got passive aggressive with me and Jill would jump in to calm things down. But even afterwards, Jill kept mentioning it and joking about it, when she knew that it would make me uncomfortable. I got pissed with Jill and she would suddenly get defensive about Jake's character. \n\nWhat was also interesting was that Jake would sometimes approach my friend and ask her what she thought about Jill. Jill would also ask her about Jake. \n\nAnd I also remember a time when Jake mentioned how Jill was having a bad day at school and ran off, causing concern among the group. We all voiced our concerns before Jake confirmed that Jill was okay. \n\nJill and Jake had even introduced us to a third friend (James, also a fake name). They claimed to have known James from an online game and that he was living in the US during the 2016 election. Trump won, which prompted James and his mother to fly out to the UK, where Jill and Jake were living. James would be staying with Jill. \n\nAt this point, you're all probably thinking why I'm just bringing up random incidents with these people. You see... Jill, Jake and James are the SAME person. \n\nJill was always a passive aggressive person who always wanted things to go her way, and she would hide behind other accounts to manipulate us into doing so. She used it to go behind our backs and constantly blame us for being mad at her. She was a toxic person and this prompted us to ditch her.",

Tries to force sexual rping which I have declined numerous times and put my foot down.  \n\n\nI wanted to do other types of rp with her. I agreed to a lot of her ideas but then she shut down every single one of mine. She knows I hate fandom rps because its not my style yet shes trying to shove a pirates of the Caribbean down my throat when I just wanted a normal mermaid and magic rp.  \n\n\nI agreed to pirates because she wanted them so badly and I thought its not a big deal even if I don't really want to do pirates. But okay I have to compromise and be respectful of my partner.  \n\n\nBut then she tried to get rid of the magic aspect of the rp and make the mermaids evil.  \nWhen I tried to say \"Hey I really want to have magic in this rp\" she agreed to it but then started limiting everything that could be done to what SHE said was okay. Not discussing it with me but saying \"It'll be this way and only this way\"  \n\n\nI'm getting beyond annoyed because its not the first time. She keeps doing this, we'll have a plan then she'll add something else and take out something I had wanted to fit her stuff in without discussing it and she'll DEMAND it in.  \n\n\nI wanted to do an rp that was focused on vampires awhile back that was friendship focused. She forced a Harem.  \n\n\nI wanted to do a college rp that was focused on family, 1 on 1 romances, friendship, bullying, hurt / comfort, peer pressure, fluff and just slice of life.

She forced a harem and demanded all of the storyline be put aside. (And then later on when she got bored with the harem demanded the storyline be sped up and then twisted it to be completely centered and focused on her char with her char causing wars with her beauty)  \n\n\nI am soooo fed up over this.",

It details my plots in an orderly fashion, has a blurb about me, and a 'would like in partners'. The \"don't do\" section is pretty minimal since I feel having a lengthy \"don't do this\" section discourages people. I keep mine to a few hard \"nos\", with one of them being not to send me a list of kinks right off the bat. It just tells me that the person is more interested in ERP, than anything else. My plots, in the same vein, don't list kinks and aren't ERP based.\n\nThis is important.\n\nEarlier this week, someone messaged me with a plot idea. I'm always open to people sending me ideas but this...Well. It could best be described as 6 pages in goggle docs detailing a plot based around \"erotic wrestling using sexual moves and non-con finishers with loose reverse harem themes\", with me writing all the men in the plot. Yes, it had a list of kinks at the bottom.\n\nMy response was a polite...Ish \"what the actual fresh fuck\". I suppose I shouldn't have been as surprised as I was when their signature suggested they liked writing non-con.\n\n**Well, that was fast**  \nSomeone messaged me about a plot I had and we started hashing out ideas. They kept wanting unhealthy character power dynamics and things my character wouldn't do. Rather than continuing to shoot down their ideas, I redirected and suggested a different way for the characters to meet up, which was via a third party.\n\nThe third party was one of my side characters and can aptly be described as a \"cheerful guy who always manages to sweet talk people into doing what he needs with a touch of bribery\". He has a name, an appearance, and a semi-fleshed out background. In short, he's not \"Faceless NPC #14642\". The gist was that he owed a favor to some person relating to the other character, agreed to help out, and roped my character into it.\n\nRather than go with that idea, the other RPer did something completely different, controlled my side character, wrote him as being greedy, aggressive, and pinning their character up against the wall. The entire last fourth of their post involved controlling my character. I messaged them, stating that I really didn't like them controlling my character. Their response was to accuse me of not liking anything they brought into the story and dropping it.\n\nBullet dodged, I think.",

Agent K who at this point has become Admin god....as in. Never does anything and only shows up to smite those who Blaspheme.  \nThere was also another Admin who quit {mainly due to reason explained in my past posts and due to K being well....them.}   \nSo two things. First Agent K makes a discord server that's private to \"talk\" to the other admins and by talk i mean. 'Cries{site owner} isn't allowed in it and does not even know about it so imma talk crap about him behind his back because he's not doing what i want and pampering me..'{btw she has a major thing...where she loves to be praised and has a habit of offering help but not really expecting people to take it and if they do she drops the ball}.  This was the last straw for the aforementioned ex admin who left and informed those who ran off the site about this. Cries was also informed and promptly ignored it because of...well personly id say simping...but Cries also was known by those on the site who knew him IRL {myself included.} To be a bit unstable. either way hed never question is fav admin.  \n\n\nNow cue in a few days later. Agent K \"Steps down\" and says someone will replace them...and the someone is........thier alternate account that a few of us knew about and though i personally missed out on the chaos i was literally the one they bosted to about said account.   \n\n\nThey were called out quickly. arguments ensued of course and past sins of both Cries and agent K  suddenly is now back and admin again....go figure. Cries/K do the normal thing they do and erase the chat messages multiple times. BUT the calling out didn't stop and eventually, they gave up clearing. of course, the cult of K and Cries popped up to 'defend\" but the damage was done.   \n\n\n  \nBonus \"how bad the admin is\" image  \n\n\n[PS this is not first nor last type of forum\\/blog post on this site either. there are lots\\/\\/most have been removed and posters banned](https://preview.redd.it/7atqf55nniz61.jpg?width=974&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=420fb000de0cf1d01808e6692d7c55094ee25802)",

I've been trying to get into it for a little while now but can't seem to get roleplays to last for more than a couple days .   \nNow any confidence i had built up in what little roleplaying i've done  is shattered.  \nSo i was doing an erotic roleplay (i know , i know). Where i was playing male in a mxf setting. During the roleplay they told me they were enjoying it ooc. We hadn't gotten too far when they stopped and said they had to go. I understood, They then went ahead to let me know that they thought i was really good at roleplay and that i wasn't making them bored and that they'd be back soon. A couple  days pass with no response and while looking for someone to roleplay with i seem them repost the exact same scenario...And then during the course of a week several others.   \n\n\nNow it might be a bit hypocritical to complain about ghosting since i had a roleplay i put on pause for a month. But atleast i informed them i was busy and by  the time i came back they had unfriended. But it just kinda hurts in this scenario cause i don't know what exactly they were lying about. Was it everything? Did  i make them uncomfortable?  did I suck the whole time and they  were just putting up with me? Was  i trying too hard?  \n   \nIt would be cool to know so I could improve on it but instead i'm left here feeling like i'm terrible at this.",

            "selftext": "So I found this place and it\u2019s like therapy for me after so many horrible experiences with people during RP. I\u2019ve met some real sickos who tried to put underaged characters in erotic RPs, brutal non-cons, and a host of other horrible things. Though one person always stands out to me as a textbook example of a abysmal roleplay partner and I still get a bit upset thinking about them. So the way this story goes is I put up a post for an erotic roleplay centered around Hela from marvel and she would go around defeating and getting down to dirty business with some characters of the marvel universe. Sounds fun and easy enough to understand right ? Wrong. I had some guy come in and ask if he could use an Anime OC, I said sure. This character was so cringe I almost puked in my mouth, he was some kind of corrupted angel with powers based off the seven deadly sins and his reference pic did his stupid character no favors. It was seriously something that a thirteen year old girl would come up with with an edgy smile, glowing eyes, the whole nine yards. I soldiered on and continued the RP, his dialogue was even worse with \u201cheh nothing personal kid\u201d type dialogue. Then he paused the RP to ask what other characters I would play. I was confused to say the least and asked him what he meant. Well according to him he should be able to defeat my character and use his lust power to make her and all the other marvel characters his total slutty girlfriends because \u201cthat is is what a harem is after all\u201d. So he expected me to play 4 other characters while he played one who wasn\u2019t even good or have any actual depth. So this guy came in, flipped the entire scenario on its head, used a cringe self insert power fantasy character, and then expected me to play a handful of characters serving him while he played his god awful OC. I left him on read and he\u2019ll stay on read.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so first of all, disclaimer here, I'm not an absolute grammar freak. Like, typos happen, autocorrect or predictive text is a thing, and my partners might not always know how to spell certain words. It happens, and I get it. Some of the best partners I had didn't have English as their first language, but their writing was still really great, albeit with the trademark second language word orders.\n\nNot a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I posted a few prompts on a couple of other sources. I try not to launch a sensory overload on my prospective female partners, so I wrote the prompt in decent detail. It outlined the start point, the general plotline, the type of characters we were going to be, and a general open ended-idea of a final conclusion/goal for it.\n\nI also specify that I am looking for a partner who can write to a similar level to me. I usually do advanced lit (I can drop anywhere from 2 to 20 paragraphs, circumstances allowing of course, and keeping in with quality over quantity).\n\nIn comes my prospective partners. The girl I had respond to me needs barely any introduction:\n\n**\"hi saw ur prompt and want 2 play it;give me ur discord and ill add u i do all the adding as peple msg me all time so i do it now i want my charcter 2 be like an anime char i hav pics for that nd who they falls in luv wiv ur character is that ok\"**\n\nThat's an actual quote from her. Putting aside the fact my role had nothing to do with anime, and it was strictly listed as a no picture roleplay, I mean, what the f\\*@k?\n\nWhen a post quite clearly mentions the type of literary style you're looking for, coming into play with that as your opening gamble is poison to my eyes. With an inability to put in punctuation (cept that semi-colon, though I can only guess that was an accident), no capital letters whatsoever, and then having the gawl to detail the roles structure anyway? Also: When drawing attention to this broken style of writing, she pointed to me having \"impossible standards\". Not sure why having a basic level of written communication is impossible, but I'll take it.\n\nAgain, no problems with people who aren't literary gods, but at least make the tiniest bit of effort!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I'd love to hear from people with similar experiences, hell, we might even be able to get a role going.

She's a great writer, and it's nice talking to her but she's like a puppy, always bugging me no matter what I'm doing or where I'm at, we have a nice fantasy roleplay going so I really don't mind that much. And one day she caught feelings I guess, So I wake up to her constant 6 AM messages as usual, but then she says this..  \n\n\nParter: Good Morning SD! How are you? Are you eating, Are you still in bed?  \n\n\nMe: I just woke up...  \n\n\nPartner: Oh ok! I love you SD! I'm glad you with me!  \n\n\nMe: I'm glad to roleplay with you to- You love me???  \n\n\nPartner: Yep! I love you!  \n\n\nSo I brush it off, because, like it's online, those things don't last I don't wanna break her heart. But then in roleplay, she starts getting really sexual with my warrior oc, to the point of descriptively smothering him with her elf tits. So I confront her and she says this.   \n\n\nMe: Yo.. Dude, this is kinda weird. This isn't an ERP  \n\n\nPartner: I know but.. I can't help it! I want to do that to you! I get wet just thinking about you!  \n\n\nMe: Whoa bro.. that .. kinda weird.. not gonna lie.  \n\n\nPartner: I don't care! I have something to ask you! Can I see your cock? I bet it's juicy and long!  \n\n\nMe: \\*laughing in two inches\\*  Yeah... This isn't gonna work out anymore. I'm sorry. It was fun while it lasted.  \n\n\nNow I kinda feel bad for leaving her like that, the girl might be fucking love-starved and I dropped her because I felt weird. What should I have done differently?   \n\n\n  \nTL;DR: RP Partner caught feelings, got lewd and I left.",

            "selftext": "For context this roleplay happened within an MMO, so it was fast paced with responses that were typically a paragraph or less.\n\nA while back I had joined a roleplaying group. One session we were disarming mines, and the group leader's character (we'll call her June) got caught in an explosion. My character was the only healer present at the time, so they very *specifically asked* for her to come help. I sent her over and have her start trying to heal June's wounds, putting effort into writing out how she called upon divine light yada yada. I ended the post with my character checking in on June to see if it was helping.\n\nThere was no response from June's writer.\n\nOkay, I thought maybe they were just in the middle of typing or had something irl pop off. No biggie. A little later another character asked my priest something, so I threw out another post responding and had her continue to heal June because that's what everyone was focused on.\n\nMore time passed, and still there was no response from June's writer. Mind, they had been shooting out plenty of one liners prior to this, even while their character was unconscious.\n\nRinse and repeat another few cycles where my priest was speaking and interacting with other characters while actively urging June's writer to give *any* inclination on whether or not the healing was effective. Soon I ran out of things to do for June and we were all just kind of standing around twiddling our thumbs waiting for June's condition to change in some way.\n\nBut then another healer appeared and took over the process (they were more skilled than my novice priest so she was happy to hand it off) and what do you know? Suddenly June's writer remembered how to type again and responded with another one liner. There was never any mention of her going afk or getting distracted or whatever, and with her consistent mini posts I *highly* doubt she was using that time to write a detailed response.\n\nNow that was frustrating but mostly I was just confused. It was pretty baffling to have my character specifically called over only to be ignored by the person she was asked to interact with.",

It doesn't really matter if I want to play a knight, a mercenary, a wizard, or anything, really. Their character always has to have something to put him above mine. \n\n\nIs there any way to avoid this? Is this something that happens with other people, or am I just particularly unlucky?",

            "selftext": "I recently remembered that and thought this was the best place to talk about that.\n\nIt was my first actual rp of all time and it was not amusing.\n\nThis guy, let's call him Tom, was looking for a Harry Potter fandom rp on Amino. He also said in his post, that he wanted his partners to be active and that it's a romance rp and he likes to include a lot of erotic stuff in his romance rps. I thought, okay, I'm working from home, so I can occasionally respond before noon and in the afternoon I'm free anyways. \nSo I contacted him. First thing, he didn't want to do that on Amino, he wanted to use WhatsApp. Great, I hate giving my number to complete strangers on the internet, but eventually agreed.\n\nNext thing, my character. She has a Japanese name, but since this was a Harry Potter fandom rp, he said an English name would be more appropriate. Then he expected me to use realistic face claims. I don't even have an anime face claim, because she is an oc. So just used a random picture of a brown haired girl, I just wanted to start, keep in mind, this was my first rp and I was really excited. He also wanted me to play Hermione and Luna, because he wanted to include canon characters as well and he said in his rps Voldemort doesn't exist. \n\nSo we started. And there was no romance. An occasional \"I love you\" and a few kisses during sex isn't romance for me. \n\nSoon he started to complain about me being inactive. Around two weeks prior to that I had a kidney failure and therefore had a lot to do that I missed in the time I was ill. Also, I always go to bed at around 10 PM, because that's just the time I get tired. He also hated it when I was online for a short time, but didn't use this time to respond. At some point I told him, that it was extremely annoying how he expected me to put the rp over my real life. He told me, that his post said he expects his partner to be active, but he agreed to not expect too much active time. That lasted for the rest of the day, the next day it just went on like before. We agreed that it's probably best if we stop, so we did. \n\nA few weeks later he messaged me again, saying he was sorry and wanted to give it a second try. Long story short, we never did that, because when I talked about the erp/romance aspect he was like \"That's just how I like my romance rps\"\n\nThis really wasn't a nice experience, but I didn't automatically think all roleplayers are like this and kept searching. And I was right, I found some great people and even made some friends.",

Im new to rp but this was the first place i had looked at but after those mods left the boss tried actin like everythng was cool when ppl where askig what happened and he was talking a mess about all of them. for his friends he was keeping talking to them about it and it was like he was really selling it but to the new people like me he dont know he was telling us we were starting drama for asking questions when his story didnt make sense. the 3 that left were the ones runnin it when i joined and my app has been sitting there for a week now. is it just me that it feels suss that the 3 who were helpful and things all left when he came back and suddenly we hear they were not doing their jobs?

I was browsing lifelessly through disboard for a dragon ball roleplaying server that fits what I like. After my last server which kind of died and shit. I was just thirsty for some roleplaying experience. this is where I come across this server which was new. I am not gonna name it. It had \"family-friendly\" and \"active staff\" typed in their server advertisement. Clicked 'join server' and was welcomed by a dude with an 8bit anime pfp. that was the owner. let's call him Tony because yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso after tony introduced me to the server and all that stuff, went to read the rules and the lore which were pretty simple and stuff. looked over the starting power levels which were extremely high for some inefficient reason. you start off around the 10 thousand scale (which is really bad for the plot, trust me). put in my character Sam (little human boy who is kind of a simp) in the doc and stuff and had it on the submission for about... 6 days. yeah, 6 days without any staff member checking it out. They can't say \"well, we were busy developing the server!\" because the whole fucking time they were sending EDP memes in the general and just roleplaying, so I decided to complain. Pinged tony and asked him \"hey, so it's been 6 days since I have submitted this character. could you check it out, please?\" in the most genuine way possible. they used the \"we were busy yada yada\" excuse to get away with it and decided to deny it because apparently, I was... harassing them? yeah, I got warned for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthere comes the co-owner who decided to accept it, let's call him Paul, so here comes paul to check it out. The first thing that crosses his mind is why my character 13 years old? I told him I wanted to and I have plans for him. he goes off talking about why child characters are useless and just \"unroleplayable\" and we had a massive fucking argument over his age and height and all that bullshit. They just kept complaining and complaining, after 2 fucking hours of nonsense he decided to drop his case and just accept it after I punched some sense in his thick skull. So here I am, with my character Sam. Ready to roleplay and have some fun because I really liked the people in there. I asked for some roleplay and stuff and got me some and days went on and on. It was all good until the first arc which was just a massive horrid pike of shit rushed down our throats. Apparently, a \"planetary parasite\" comes out of the unknown with no fucking reason but just some stupid SJW agenda about \"environment protection\" and destroys a city. The heroes all were at the power levels of like 40k and higher Combined forces to take on the threat (despite not knowing each other at all).\n\n I dislike these types of arcs where there is one single fucking threat and everyone just keeps attacking. Like, put some more story. Anyways, there we go. Oh, I forgot to mention that the owner tony made a new character who is literally fucking naruto (despite the server denying canon OCS and naruto being from naruto and the server is dragon ball themed) sheesh. They started off 43k and were ready to battle the threat despite not knowing anything about it. This is arguably possible because nobody knows what the fuck is happening at the moment. Here we go! Boom boom. Everyone is just blasting at the fucking parasite like a bunch of hooligans. It was embarrassing and shitty. After the roleplay finished. Everyone was given a boost. The owner for some fucking reason boosted his 43k character to like 300k or some shit but it was very high. You see, the training system works like this (the more you type, the better your boost!) which was grindy as shit, and kind of rigged because I typed like 90 paragraphs of fucking training to just get a boost of 10k added to my 23k making me 33k, while the owner's friend who typed way less than me (20 paragraphs which were not bad) got to 180k when his OC's pl was like 40k. It was just painful and infuriating for me. I didn't argue because these fucking guys oh boy, they don\u2019t agree with you at all they just wanna feel like they won an argument after repeating the same shitty counterargument over and over. Oh, and not to mention my fucking techniques! Which were just 3 techniques. Easy and understandable. They made a massive argument about the technique's color and shit. Changed the color and there we go. I sat there, waiting 21 FUCKING DAYS. TWENTY-ONE FUCKING DAYS WAITING FOR MY 3 FUCKING TECHNIQUES TO BE APPROVED. Pinged the owner tony who went \"I'm busy\". Pinged the stupid co-owner paul who made another argument about the drawbacks which were reasonable. Finally, they approved it (despite not putting it in the approved techniques channel). I was just angry at that moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo days went on and my character was just growing stupidly slow in power because nobody wants to RP with me, while everyone else was growing too fast, And there comes the day, that I am finally free from this shitshow of a fucking server. The server apparently died and stopped getting members and shit, So they decided to make it private, and oh boy\u2026 oh no no no. the co-owner paul turned into a homophobic racist fucking asshole who screamed the n-word with the hard r and typed in F words over and over in the chat with their stupid case \"it's a private server now\"\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeft the server with a \"FUCK YOU\" and found another server that is better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou probably didn't understand anything so I apologize in advance if this kind of agitated you, and sorry for the language.",

            "selftext": "We were dumb teenagers when we started roleplaying. I discovered RP on gaia, back in 2010, 2011. I made a Hogwarts guild, ran it as headmaster, and he was my Vice Captain. Nerevar was a part of his username, I won't say the whole thing so as not to expose his account but yeah. Nerevar. I'll never forget that. He played a former auror, then a defense against the dark arts instructor ten years ago. I was an attention seeking teenager. In part because I was bullied at school, my dad had been abusive then had a stroke and was trying to make amends and I was struggling to forgive him. Man, I was such a self-absorbed guild leader, I don't know why anyone put up with me, heh.  \n\n\nBut Nerevar was always so level headed. He was about my age, but even then, he was mature. Kind. An incredible writer, too. While I was just learning and writing one liners, he could describe a scene as if he were writing a book, make me imagine it...that's what I loved. Writing with him really helped me escape. There were a lot of good writers there.   \nI made more characters- a lot more. Some I didn't even want to claim as my own because I didn't want people to know I had like, 6. Or 5? At least 5. One crewmember found out and quit, she was upset with me for wanting to keep them private and act like they were someone else. I can't really blame her for that. It was like Nerevar knew, though. He knew I was just some angsty teenager looking to write, and we understood that about one another.  \n\n\nHe was a good dude. And a great rper. I guess this doesn't fit for bad rper stories, I just wanted to share it. It feels strange, to miss someone I never met. I only learned his real name when he passed away. I knew him as Kenneth, the Auror. Kenneth was my friend. So RIP Kenneth. And thank you.",

            "selftext": "I was just ghosted last night by an RPer that I have been in contact with for about three months.  Originally I had responded to their ad that was a very specific story they wanted to play out between two of her OC characters.  It sounded really interesting and a lot like a TV show I enjoyed so I was very interested.  She liked my reply and it hit things off right away.   She was a novella type RPer which was fine.  That isn't my normal but I am more than happy to try and match what my partner prefers. They had amazing writing, very descriptive and beautifully detailed.  This person commented back that mine was the same way and had been very very excited to play things out.   We played that storyline for maybe three weeks, averaging about one response a day because they were so long and detailed.\n\nEventually, this person came to me and said they were super upset and sorry to have to pause things, but there was a new baby in the house and now that the baby was getting a bit older, she had to shift her priorities around and didn't have the time to offer back the detailed novella type writing she wanted because she was exhausted. I 100% understood.  It was disappointing because the story was really good and just getting to some juicy dramas but life is always first.  We stopped the RP then, but she had said she did love to RP with me and should she have time in the future would really enjoy matching up again and finding a new story.  I was down for that.\n\nSo we didn't really speak for about five to six weeks but I left her on my Discord on the off chance she would be free again and we could reconnect.  I was delightfully surprised when she contacted me again a couple weeks ago saying she now had time to post but maybe something less detailed, limited to 2-3 paragraphs a go.  I was stoked because that is more my style and she is an amazing writing.  We worked out a new story, something kind of mafia based.  I played a Michael Corleone like character from The Godfather who begrudingly has to take over the family business.\n\nThis RPer was very excited about the idea, made a server and put a lot of detail and time into her characters, I did to mine and we started posting.  While this one didn't have as much chemistry as the initial story, it was still decent and I enjoyed the flow.   I started to get the idea maybe she wasn't as into it though and asked her.  She advised it was a bit slow (I had started it before my character had to take over the business to offer ample room for plot and development).   In hopes of making it more interesting to her, I offered to then time jump after wrapping up our initials scenes, to a point where our characters re-meet a couple years later and he is already full of angst.\n\nMy partner agreed to this and her excitement was renewed.  She seemed more into it, engaged and would even message me OOC just how it was getting really good.  I was glad we had sorted things out and talked it over.   She was even starting to post novella style again, which was fine with me, I kind of took it as her being as excited as she said.  So I started to match it.  \n\nThe thing was, now I was feeling like things weren't as fun.  Her last go had been very elaborate, including a flashback scene between the time jump we did.   It ended in an unexpected twist where her character and several of my characters bodyguards were taken out by a mysterious tranquilizer dart and left in the middle of a club parking lot.  It seemed really different from the usual story we'd been writing, but I went with it.  I wrote a response, opted to mimic what she did with the flashback and added one of my own.  She wrote about how things were finally 'getting really good.'  I felt bad because now I wasn't having as much fun \\[I wasn't as connected with the character for novella writing to come as easily\\].  I told myself I would give it a couple more days and if I was still not feeling it bring it up to her again to see if we could adjust to the 2-3 paragraphs she originally wanted.\n\nYesterday night, she just ghosted me.  The server was gone and she unfriended me from Discord.  Her last message to me had been a positive one, how she was looking forward to things.  I'm just so confused.   She has come to me before and explained, as hard as it was, that she needed to take a break and I understood.  She has brought up concerns about the RP, we spoke about it and worked it out.  She \\*said\\* she was excited.  So to see that she just up and removed me like that was more than shocking and surprising.  \n\nI'm not sure what I did wrong.  I would have understood if she was busy, she knows that from the past.   She even thanked me before starting up again that I kept her as a friend after the last one died out because not a lot of people actually do that.  Obviously something was going on on her end, but since she had been so open in the past, I'm not sure why I suddenly get ghosted.  It's so disheartening.\n\nTL;DR - RPer with really good communication skills that was seemingly excited about the plot we had just ghosted me for no reason.",

I briefly mention I'm in a relationship irl,  happy with that, and he plays my vampire's ghoul.\n\nTab 2: Character info, specifically noting that my vampire is in a relationship with his ghoul and they're basically inseparable. There's even openly known plans within the RP group to \"blood bond\" them if the ghoul is ever turned so they are literally unable to leave each other. If we were any more monogamous we'd be a 1950s TV power couple.\n\nTab 3: Limits such as no attacking without actually roleplaying first, no smut, no killing my character off without a good RP reason, and that I will never be interested in hooking up with anyone/anything IC or OOC because my ghoul is played by my offline partner and I'm happily taken and claimed. (Yes, claimed.)\n\nSimple no?\n\nApparently not. I've had one woman storm out of a scene after brazenly flirting and thoughtposting about fucking my character, who hasn't interacted with me since I ICly turned her down and said I was gay after she was straight up approaching to feed from and fuck my character. She was thoughtposting so hard that due to my vampire wearing a collar (repeatedly stated to have been put there by his sire as he was a prisoner) that he must be a very good, obedient ghoul. Uhm... No? Lady, I'm on my own in an Elysium with blatant Nosferatu traits (Parisii inspired, not a bat-looking leper. \"Ruggedly Ugly\" trait). She doesn't even interact OOC anymore. I'm not complaining, honestly, her thoughtposting was driving me insane.\n\nI've had another who, despite knowing myself and my character are gay, has repeatedly stated that if my character wears any sort of leather gear, she'll want him. That if my character was human, she'd want to ghoul him for herself, and that after telling her flirting and offers of money won't change my character's mind about teaching her his clan specific powers, that hers \"always gets what she wants\".\n\nAnd then there's the random DMs I get, always from women, commenting about how hot my character is or that is outfits are sexy. I've made a point of replying \"I'll be sure to let my partner know, he'd be happy to hear it\" in a half joking way, but holy shit, if the roles were reversed I'd be called all sorts for daring to slide into some random woman's DMs to tell her that her character is hot. Most of them brush it off and leave it at that, but I've had certain *individuals* threaten to report or even block me for telling them I'm not interested. I'm not even humble bragging. This is not okay!\n\nI'm just. Not. Interested.",

            "selftext": "I made an ad awhile back for rp partners on a website, I got 7 takers all of them were super nice seeming people 5 of them outright ignored me after a month of rping together.  \nThe 6th person wanted me to discuss even my characters names with them and get their approval for everything, wasn't flexible at all and insisted everything be fully her decision while yet not giving me anything but one liners to work with.  \n\n\nThen person 7 I was friends with for a month first then she became the one I've been rping with for 6 months (straight, daily. Anytime I wanted to take a break they would spam me and make me rp with them.) For the following reasons I've gotten to a point where I just dread and hate this rp I have going on with her.  \n1. They told me \"Oh don't worry I get that you don't like friendships in an rp taking real time to develop\" - Then proceeds to take 6 months now and my character is still one she'd be willing to kill off  \n2. She got upset that I made one of my male characters Polyromantic like me and put him with another guy instead of as part of her harem (its a reverse harem rp she insisted on it)  \n3. I'm playing 25 characters and she expects every single one to be 100% unique with no shared traits, and wants for me to be able to get every single one past her character's \"walls\" before the next major event where she will kill anyone off who isn't friends with her char. (Which that event she keeps speeding past everything else to get to and I probably only have 2 irl days left until she forces us into that)  \n\n\n4. she has to have her character the most powerful and beautiful person in the rp that everyone even women are all over all the time.  \n5. I'm repulsed ace (She knows this) yet she keeps trying to push sexual references into the rp and keeps trying to put our chars into sexual situations.  \n6. Her character knows every single secret that no one is supposed to know. Like my character is the son of the king but even my character doesn't know. Yet somehow her character knows and threatens the king with it.  \n\n\n7. Shes obsessed with her character becoming cold and heartless so that everyone has to work harder to befriend her (note: 6 months and not a single character of mine has even gotten off her KILL list)  \n8. She constantly tries to give her character amnesia, Unreversable amnesia so my characters have to start all over again to befriend her.  \n9. She keeps making every \"hot\" villain part of her harem and taking control of my own characters.  \n\n\n10. She ignores half my post and just cherry picks whatever part she wants to roll with then twists my characters words and actions to fit her posts constantly.  \n11. Keeps telling me whenever I have an issue with her and try to talk to her about it, that her previous RP partners put her down all the time for her rping rather than talk with her. Then proceeds to go on about ideas she really wants which makes me feel too guilty to refuse.  \n12. She made a character more powerful than even my villains and is just taking over everything killing everyone wiping out my villains ruining every last plot that we have been planning and building up to for months. Because she wants a hot powerful man in her harem so she made him.  \n\n\n13. Whenever my characters had any story arc she rushed through it, time skipped to get to things she wanted to do. Was cold towards my characters OOC and IRP, would not allow me to even have ANY character development. All of my men are just accessories to hang off of her and it makes me sick. When i try to have anything even with my polyromantic character and the love of his life she skips past and ruins it constantly.  \n14. she tries to force me to make my characters with personalities she wants for them. When even in my rp partner ad I explained that I cannot write set personalities, personalities develop as I go, I can't RP with that kind of limitation, its just how I work.  \n15. My ad specifically said romance is a MUST in any rp for me, she acknowledged that and I spoke to her about it both when she responded to my ad and before we started the rp just to make sure she was 100% understanding and okay with it. Part of why i made my one char in a relationship because I needed SOMETHING at this point. Because its been so long and none of my chars are even FRIENDS with hers.  \n\n\nBecause of all of this it takes every last bit of my will power not to drop my RP with her.  \nI have no one else to RP with because no one matches my style, she was the closest person I could find. I like her as a person but she is really getting on my nerves and no matter how many times I talk to her she just refuses to listen. It feels like a chore, a job now. Not something fun to do.",

            "selftext": "Here is a 'bad worldbuilding' story I encountered in a group roleplay. Now, let me be clear that I have nothing against the premise of asexual vampires or vampires whose biology makes them incapable of having sex for whatever reason...but the way that the mod of this group roleplay introduced this information (or rather, failed to mention it) left me speechless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mod of this roleplay and I were somewhat online friends (although this friendship did not last long because of other reasons). We were on very good terms, and when I decided to make my first vampire character, because before I had only written humans, I discussed this character with her.\n\nWhen I joined, this roleplay had been maybe a year old, and when this conversation took place, I was already a part of it for maybe half a year. So, we were discussing the new character, let's call him Rick, and I mentioned in passing that I wanted Rick to be very popular with the ladies, but he is not interested in a long-term relationship. I personally don't do any ERP or Smut, and she knew that very well, so this was only part of Rick's backstory. The mod replied 'That is silly, vampires can't have sex.' I thought what she meant was that the roleplay wasn't an ERP, so I ensured here that like always, I wasn't interested in writing sexual scenes, detailed or otherwise.\n\nHer reply was this 'No, all vampires are physically unable to have sex and are therefore not interested in it, at all. They can't be. This is stupid.' This left me...confused to say the least. I looked at all the detailed background information for each race (vampire, human, and so on), and no where did it mention anything about this. I looked at all the lore and the description of the roleplay, nothing. Only 'If you only join the roleplay to fool around and have sex with other characters, whether they are vampires or humans, this roleplay isn't for you.'\n\nOkay, so this was definitely something I wished I had known before creating my character...and it was also information that nobody of the other writers seemed to have. Two female human characters were basically on the hunt for a sexy male vampire, which was pretty obvious from their character profiles, and although romance is possible without sex, I am pretty sure that their characters wanted the latter, too. All of the vampire characters' profiles, including those of the mod, made no mention of this information at all. \n\nI asked a friend of mine with a female vampire character in the roleplay if she knew about this, she did not. So, although we did not want to write sex at all...it would probably good to know that my character is completely incapable of having it. But okay, I knew now. So, I asked the mod if she wanted to clarify this somewhere in the description and the lore, because she was my friend and I had a feeling that a lot of the other writers did not know this.\n\nAnd she got angry with me. She told me that the sentence 'If you only join the roleplay to fool around and have sex with other characters, whether they are vampires or humans, this roleplay isn't for you.' was more than enough. Everyone who did not get it based on this sentence should learn to read more closely, and she does not want any sex-crazed perverts in the roleplay anyway. \n\nI tried to explain to her that it was not a matter about writing sex-scenes, that it was just information people should know about their vampire characters...but she was having none of it and got more and more annoyed and angry with me. She also basically told me not to make a big deal out of it and not to mention  it in the roleplay chat. So I decided to let go and stopped engaging in the discussion.\n\nLater, because she had shown a lot more very questionable behavior, I began to wonder if she just made that worldbuilding information up on the spot because she did not like that aspect about my character.",
