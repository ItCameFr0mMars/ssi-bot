            "selftext": "Sometimes when you start writing with someone it can be great, they meet your level and all your expectations then somewhere it goes down hill. I have had many years of ghosting and straight up bad luck I could post at least a hundred stories on this sub of my dead ends and God awful experiences but I mainly need clarification if I'm in the wrong or not. I will number the examples and I really want to hear feedback because if I'm in the bad I want to change and be aware to better myself for future partners.\n\n1.] Simple Marvel rp, supposed to be my OC with Steve Rogers [Captain America] and I spoke with the person which seemed very excited, but the more we planned I wanted to start and they always gave me a reason why they couldn't yet. Education and personal life or even jobs come first so I fries to be patient. We spoke OOC and planned things over a span of two weeks. Then I asked again if we could get the ball rolling, once more a logical reason came up amd I thought okay no worries. Two weeks turned into 3 and I waited about a month. Then I noticed a pattern, if I asked when a possible free time could be used for rp they made excuses like their little sister had a sleepover amd they were watching things, the next day the excuse was their sister broke their arm, days after they said they got distracted by organizing their entire collection of DVDs then sent a picture of maybe 5 cases which I said enough because it seemed they blew me off amd had no interest. I decided to thank them for their time but couldn't keep waiting after a whole month of planning amd having no progress to show. Days later their 'friend' messages me saying how I was a twisted and selfish person for ghosting and dropping them. I was impatient and made their 'friend' feel pressured amd forced to rp [which never happened, I asked three times in the span of a week because I know I can be a little pushy] but I blocked that account and started feeling bad because I still ask myself am I pushy?\n\n2.] Started a BBC Sherlock rp about 2 years back and I absolutely fell for their portrayal of Mycroft Holmes because face it, fi.ding a decent Holmes writer is like finding a needle in the haystack. We wrote almost every single day and we planned for our characters to have an accidental conception due to Holmes being a busy body. So willingly I agreed and let my OC be smitten with him sort of an enemies to lovers plot. After the conception this person expressed their joy amd trust in having me as their friend and partner for their Holmes. Eventually Holmes pdoposes to my OC since she was carrying his children [yes twins] and we sent pictures OOC back and fourth we even planned a ceremony for the group of friends we had and everyone even people they knew before I came along was overjoyed. Everyone was excited until a small misunderstanding happened..a Sherlock writer realized my talent for getting into character and wanted to pull a prank on their John. They let me pretend to be them in the heart of a monthly theme PotterLock so there was now Two Sherlock's only one being the real him.\n\nI wanted to do this because it'd be funny to play along and confuse people, I studied his typing habits and OOC banter I fooled his friends and one leader of the group but they laughed. I also wanted to ask his John why they've been avoiding my Character, Sherlock encouraged me to ask because he noticed some avoidance and hesitation from John. My OC amd John were a will they/won't they fling. Flirtatious jokes before Holmes asked my OC to marry him, drunken moments of fluff and assurance, My OC was motherly amd nurturing toward John so for him to avoid me felt upsetting. Disguised as Sherlock I asked ams they basically told me unknowingly they just felt like they were leading me on with no real interest of more and talking to me felt wrong since their feelings were both there and not there. You may ask what has this to do with Mycroft, well my partner messaged Sherlock which was my on the account at the time and I was freaking out. I felt bad and wanted to tell them it was me but they had trust issues and I worried they may think I've been Sherlock all along. I couldn't just ignore them, i panicked and sent a message to the real Sherlock. Hey, they asked a question what do I do? I don't wanna look at your private conversation is there an answer you want me to say? No responce. Sherlock was a leader of this group so I tried to answer as they would and leave it at that. After hearing more from John I felt awful I never wanted them to feel like I didn't care so I logged off and back in my account. A few days later I finally told Mycroft what happened and explained the prank that Sherlock planned and needed help in playing them they dropped me..\n\nMind you, we planned a wedding. My OC was pregnant with their twins and they said I couldn't be trusted I was two faced and they never wanted to see or speak to me again. I still beat myself up for it but I'm not really sure if im in the wrong for not just saying. Hey its me pretending to be Sherlock or ignore their message and possibly ruin the friendship between them amd the leader. A year passed and we tried to reconnect but they still kept me at a distance and finally we rp'ed again but it was the same. They spoke to me less and less, they left our rp on read for a month, talked to others and rp'ed with them in public chats or private, I just felt so abandoned and unwanted I deleted the app with no word and removed myself because why stay? \n\n3/last one] I started a youtuber rp, Unus Annus amd we had promised to double up. Same story, it went great and we wrote everyday nearly. The flow was perfect and the character portrayal was amazing. But..the last time we had really good flow was December and responces were very bare. OOC wasn't great, no updates were given, when they spoke they had logical reasons and I tried to wait. It just felt they weren't interested anymore. I was hurt and upset waiting for months and months at a time. I wanted to wait but they'd say they were able to send a responce one day then nothing for a week. They promised things would get more active only to see they made posts on reddit and still nothing, it felt more like I wasn't having my time valued anymore and I finally had to quit. They made one last promise after a handful got broken I just couldn't do it anymore, I thanked them for their time and tried to express how the silence made me feel anxious and unsettled but I still feel like maybe I could've kept waiting..",

            "selftext": "Sometimes I get the people who tend to rely too much on their art to attract people. They're not great at roleplaying and SOME people who splash hundreds of dollars on art tend to be arrogant and elitist. Not all of them, mind you. Although it might be a bit iffy with some people, but I like to write up and do some worldbuilding for a growth and transformation RP.\n\nI had this one partner who played muscular women (with extra parts, I'm sorry if I scarred you) I can tell their alts because they all have the same bodily proportions on their character and some of their interests and content in the story are the same, just worded differently or sometimes not at all.\n\nFor example I would write up a quick paragraph.  \n\n\n\"So and so wakes up from a long sleep.   \n\n\nCome... \n\nCome...  \n\n\nCome...  \n\n\nA voice beckons so and so, when approached... so and so comes to and finds herself in the middle of an unfamiliar street, there are tudor-esque buildings and the road beneath her are paved in cobblestone, there are people looking at her with a mix of fear and uncertainty as if the woman had just come back from the dead!  \n\n\nThree things can be done from here, find out where you are by asking the townsfolk, explore the town or figure out what has just transpired on your own.\n\nThis is just an example, but I tend to write up a 4 paragraph opener for a DM/GM scene which will take me half an hour to do annnnnd all I got from this person was...\n\n\\*Does that\\*\n\nI had put all my effort into that post...for...two...words. So I was like \"I'm sorry, but I'm tired I'm going to put an end to this here.\"\n\nI dunno what possessed this woman to think I wanted to continue RPing with her but she was extremely lazy in her posts. No personality, just dry, desperation for someone to be her post pig. Minimal effort for someone who puts in maximum effort in his posts.\n\nFor the next WEEK she approached me on her alts with:  \n\n\n\"Hello\"  \n\"Hello.\"  \n\"Hi.\"  \n\"Hi.\"  \n\"Hello.\"  \n\"Hello.\"  \n\"Hi.\"  \n\"Hi.\"  \n\"Hi.\"  \n\"Hello.\"\n\nI wanted this person to get a clue but it dragged on too long. This person wasn't going to get the hint that I wanted to play with her so I was forced to block her. I had enough. Lot's of people judge me on my character that I put a lot of effort into and deny me on \"Too many word. Hurt brain.\" on my character's profile and when I do find people...they're just lazy and want me to write porn for them.\n\nIs it just me or is the quality of roleplay partners declining?",

Friend for two years.  \nThings were going well.  \n\n\nNow I'm s\\*x repulsed asexual and I make all of my characters Canonically Ace in the worlds I create to avoid any forced ERPing and because theres not enough representation anywhere for ace characters, so I ENJOY making ace characters even if its just me and my partners or my groups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis friend for the past month has been trying to push me into sexually rping our characters.  \nShe wanted our characters to inhale aphrodisiac and start feeling up on eachother.  \nI said \"No. If you don't remember, My characters are ace and so am I and I'm not comfortable with that\" she pushed and pushed  \n\n\n\"please please please, It won't go too far I'll just have my character pass out\" - shes said things like this before for other situations and never stuck to it  \nso I told her \"No. We can do something else, not that. I'm not comfortable with that it crosses my boundaries, please respect that.\"  \n\n\nThen recently she took control of my characters in the last week to put them in a sexual situation. I deleted her posts she did that in since it was my discord server and told her to \"Knock it off! I already told you no twice, told you numerous times me and my characters are asexual. You are crossing my boundaries. Stop.\"  \n\n\nThen just yesterday she wrote smutty fanfictions of my characters and started to tell me about how she made her character have s\\*x with all of them. Which p\\*ssed me off for 1. She went and made it so my characters were \"fixed\" by writing it as they discovered they were just repressed. 2. she went behind my back to do it after I explicitly kept telling her my characters were ace. 3. I'm not comfortable and told her but she still told me about it all too.",

            "selftext": "So I'm on Discord one day. Think it was my first day of joining the server the person in question was in, on the 19th of April. They ask for an RP. NSFW, but that's besides the point. Goes on for a good two hours before ending. Went pretty well. I thank them for the RP, then go about the rest of my day.\n\nThe next day, they ask for another RP. I tell them no because I was still tired from only just waking up. They don't respond for the rest of the day, so I do something else.\n\nThe 21st, they ask for ANOTHER RP. I say yes, it goes on for three hours. They ask if they can do another scenario in about an hour. The hour passes, unfortunately, something unexpected came up for me, so when they asked if I was ready to continue, I told them no. Thinking that was the end of that, I go about doing the thing I needed to do. 50 FUCKING MINUTES PASS, still not done with the shit I needed to do. \"How about now?\" Against my own lack of judgement, I agree, thinking it'd be quick. FOUR HOURS. I think you can tell where this is going, the person has the RPs drag on for far too long.\n\n22nd. ANOTHER FUCKING ASK for an RP. Like fucking Hell, do they not understand I have a life OUTSIDE of Discord and roleplaying!? They sent me this AS I FUCKING WOKEN UP, by the way, so I tell them no, because I'm too tired and not in the mood to RP. An hour passes. \"Now?\" Ugh, if they're not going to leave me alone, then fine... I've been very understanding in all of this. I tell them yes, but only if it's quick. They agree, then apologise for the last long RP. I tell them it's fine, problem solved, right? RP goes on for an hour, going quite well. I then get ghosted for 10 hours before being asked if I wanted to continue after I'd already lost interest. I tell them no, no worries. Next day comes, ANOTHER RP REQUEST. I tell them sure, thinking the long RP situation had been solved. Goes on for an hour, oh dear, getting overwhelmed with DMs. So I ask to put the RP on hold. They agree, and so two hours later, we continue. Overall time spent on the RP? Three hours. Okay, so not as long, but still a bit too long for my liking. Few hours pass, ask if I'm up to continue, I tell them no, an hour later, they ask AGAIN, saying it'll be quick So I continue, knowing full well it was late, thinking in my mind: \"This better be quick...\" Goes on for an hour, I get ghosted again. Okay, fair enough, it must've been late for both of us, we'll continue it in the morning. And so we do. THREE HOURS pass, and I need to go get something to eat, so I say \"BRB\". They say \"Ok\", no worries, I go and get food. 15 fucking minutes later before I'm even back, they go \"Ready?\" AS IF THEY DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE FUCKING CONCEPT OF THE ABBREVIATION OF BE RIGHT BACK! At least have the goddamn courtesy to wait for your partner to actually get back before asking for a response! I should've cut off the interaction right then and there after three constant days of being pestered for RPs that go on for far too fucking long for my liking. But I didn't. I persevered. I continue the RP for about an hour, then get ghosted for another four hours because my partner had apparently fell asleep. They ask if we can continue, I tell them I need a break from RPing for a few days.\n\nDay passes, they weirdly ask me if I've seen a certain TV show for some reason. I hadn't, so I answer truthfully. Next day, literally as I've woken up: \"Want to do an rp?\" Not even a fucking \"Hi\" beforehand. I don't care who you are, two days does NOT constitute as \"A few\". I'm starting to get very pissed off at this point, so I tell them I've literally just woken up, to which they're in a goddamn mood about it. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAME TO ME AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS. You'd think that'd be the end of our interactions, but no, half a fucking hour later, they're back at it again asking for another damn RP. \n\nAlmost every single fucking day since the 26th of April, it's been the exact same conversation in the morning. Them: \"Hey.\" (Or any other form of hello.) Me: \"Hi.\" Them: \"Want to do an RP?\" ALMOST EVERY DAY. And I've obliged them... I don't want to seem like a dick and break off the interaction, but I've been pestered for an RP nearly every fucking day since I met them. What can I do?",

Alright let's get started!\n\nI met K on omegle of all places back around 2015. She was a nice person who definitely knew how to roleplay. I would even say that she was far better then I was at the time. Come 2016 we became close friends and I got to know her better. Hell we even shared phone numbers and began to talk. I even remember a few nights were I would have to play as a amateur therapist as I heard her rant and cry. \n\nIt all changed once 2016 had come to a close. I quickly picked up on something. It was almost as if her entire personality had changed within a month or two. She was more aggressive and started to make passive aggressive remarks against me. I felt like she hated me for who I am. We continued to roleplay loosely for a while but I noticed that several of the plot points she was putting in wasn't original ideas. They were simply real life events converted into a dark fantasy roleplays. \n\nThat being said I don't mind if real life events like that are used. Just in the past I've had horrible experiences of people just using it as a way of making up lazy plot points. She had me play the big bad guys who were nothing more then strawmen for her own believes. I quickly came to the realization that this was just one big power trip for her and ended the roleplay as best as I could to make sure it didn't get dragged through the mud any further. \n\nShe then vanished for a while and came back with massive amounts of luggage. She than preceded to dump said luggage on me. I acted as an emotional punching bag for a very long time and I was getting sick of it. Last year was the breaking point. Right around the time when the first real protests and riots accrued in the US. She simply asked one night out of the blue, \"Do you support the protests?\" I told her I have no interest and I'm simply trying to escape from the world. I sent that message, turned off my phone and went to bed. \n\nThe next day, I turned on my phone and checked my messages. I've never seen someone as angry and as spiteful as this woman in my life. Finally I realized that she blocked me which brought me to tears. Even if she fucking despised me, I still counted her as a friend. \n\nI'm using this story as a warning to everyone. Be careful on who you count as your friend. There's probably a good chance that they are hiding who they really are. Roleplay allows us to escape and create our own worlds.

And then a bunch of male players come in and apply or send a request to RP, while also making it super apparent that they\u2019re male. They don\u2019t really try to hide it\u2013 they just announce it, from the front up, even when the OP makes it obvious that they won\u2019t pick them because they\u2019re obviously not what OP is looking for. And, on rare occasions, they get huffy for not being picked to join in the game or their request to roleplay is refused.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a confused observance rather than frustration and I\u2019m just kind of wondering... well, why? Why do that? You obviously know what the result is, why couldn\u2019t you just move on since you\u2019re not what they\u2019re looking for?\n\nI guess the same exact question can be asked to people who lie about their age to their roleplay partners. But at least they attempt to hide their age\u2013 these guys literally announce that they\u2019re not what the OP is looking for.",

He respected the world building, the sex scenes were fantastic and we really felt each other's vibe.....\n\nThen mid way through a sed scene he nailed my characters palms to a bed head \ud83d\ude10\n\nYeah so you're probably asking \"TF?!\" YEAH IKR!?!?. So I asked him what the deal was about the scenes sudden switch into a torture porn scene and he said he read one of my other posts from MONTHS AGO and noticed it was a little fucked up, so he deduced I'd be into that. Now, I wouldn't be complaining about this at all IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT I SPECIFICALLY SAID I DIDNT WANT SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE EXACT POST HE FOUND ME FROM. I specifically stated my limits.\n\nI explained that that was then and this is now and that I'd moved past that phase. I was curious about darker kinks and haven't gone into that style in months as it doesn't fit me. he said he understood and we quickly back peddled and continued.....\n\n10 minutes later he's biting my fingers off.....\n\n\"Oh please you didn't actually mean what you said. I know you're into this stuff. You're just PLAYING HARD TO GET.\" \n\n\ud83d\ude11\n\nYou people need to stop. Stop disrespecting limits. Stop assuming you know people's minds.

It's copied and pasted from part of a message my friend received and was just taken aback by this very strangely detailed and confusing description of an original character.\n\n\n\"My character description (it's an original one from me) I am of the Rokdaur species that apparently went extinct a few hundred years ago. Our (my species') lifespan is approximately 800 years and I am the last of my kind. I stand 8'3\" tall and have the upper body of a human male species with a big and plump chest and have 14 abs beneath the chest. My body is covered in pitch black fur completely apart from my face and the front of my body where the chest and abs were. My hands were muscular with triceps nearly as thick as 50 inches in circumference and each of my claws (hand) had 3 fingers and one thumb, each of them having 6 inch tall razor sharp talons to rip the flesh and meat in one smooth swift swoop! My feet were similar to that of a dog's as the thighs were as thick as 90 - 95 inches and the calf muscles were nearly as thick as triceps. I didn't wear any attire as such and except for a big bear skin rug that covered my waist all the way to my knees.My face was that of a dog's with 2 canines at the front of each, upper and lower jaw, not one of them measuring less than 7 inches. My eyes were yellow in color and I growled most of the time as I was not used to having company or worse.. Threat! My ears stood up straight and were as long as the canine.My back consisted of a foot long furry tail wagging slowly and at the center of my spine were 4 - six feet tall tentacles hovering in the air that have a sense of their own and can intimate me if they see any close or imminent danger.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions on it and if you're interested or not, please let me know your thoughts. Thank you for your time :) It's basically a MythicalCreature X AdventurGirl/Explored girl related scenario. It will involve slow burning romance, you can add twists and turns anywhere you feel like, but there will only be two characters that we'll be playing individually :)\"",

I only stated a bit of the plot because of character limits and all. One person slid into my dms and stated that they had am idea for the role. I don't mind incorporating someone else's ideas if they wish. I responded, \"oh, I actually had an idea for the role but I don't mind hearing your ideas as well!\" The dude came back with, \"oh so you let your partners do all of the work? I'll pass.. bye!\" Then he started commenting on the post that no one should waste their time on me because I'm lazy. \n\nI'm so confused, this isn't the first time this has happened. I always feel like I've done something wrong and that I should just go back to solo writing. Maybe I could have said something different? I know I probably shouldn't take it so personal but it hurts as I take pride in my writing, characters, and story ideas.",

            "selftext": "\\[Notice: I will not be saying the name of this roleplay site in PMs or in the comments. This will remain completely anonymous.\\]\n\nThis is not on my main account for reasons. I don't want the admins of this site to know who posted this because they'd outright ban me if they found out.\n\nI've been part of this forum roleplay community for 10 hellish years. It seemed nice - it was a few different worlds you can play in the creators having set the boundaries and so forth. I chose to RP all over the different worlds, clocking up countless hours and time on this roleplay site. I was a fairly popular user and highly respected by the staff - the staff loved my RP style and the users kept wanting to roleplay with me.\n\nIt wasn't till 3 years into a my roleplay career they decided to hop on the discord trend. All seemed well until they decided it was a great idea to let everybody join it and expected everybody to play ball with each other. This ended badly as they were people posting threats and inappropriate images. Some of the mods had asked to ERP with others in DMs. There was this younger user who they constantly bullied to the point where said user was getting death threat constantly outside of that chat in other discords with the same people from the community. Coming from mostly adults 23+, this was very inappropriate.\n\nNeedless to say, they shut down the discord a mere year and a half after due to the toxicity and with that sprung up a new issue. People were really mad at this, to the point where they created their own discord chats which sprung up even more drama. With said drama even, the moderators of the site began to threaten to ban people if they didn't bend to their whims. Drama from discord wasn't allowed to be a bannable offense but that didn't stop some moderators from attempting to.\n\nLuckily after the discord drama calmed down - there was barely any site drama - apart from the fact that some new user got annoyed at the staff for the site being vague and them and their friends leaving - but apart from that - there was nothing.\n\nNow here comes the real kicker - the owner decides to retire the site and move it to another one - and with it comes one person being really pissed off at the staff for doing so. The staff didn't care about what people were saying about the site moving, just they were doing it - no questions asked.\n\nAnd so they move the site to a new platform. Seems all is fine but I'm hearing there's been even more drama on their private little discord chats. To the point where it's shown up on the new site, on their wiki they signed up on fandom. According to what had happened and with the new site policy, they can delete people's accounts that lurk constantly/be inactive to reduce the user accounts on the site. A user got really mad about it and started a discussion with the staff which led to them being site banned on both the forum's new wiki and the site itself.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what to believe. The staff won't take suggestions from multiple people suggesting things to improve the wiki and apparently people are getting banned for disagreement.\n\nSo here comes the question, do I even stay on this site knowing there's still a lot of drama behind the scenes or do I go to another roleplay site?",

I needed a group to play as the rest of the crusaders, and the antagonists. So I'm Noriaki, and 5 other members were the rest of the Crusaders. So one person controlled Joeseph Joestar and DIO, So at Holy Kujo's Mansion, t person who played Joesph tried forcing themself on Kak, so I let them know like bro, don't do that, and so they said yes ok ok. But when we got to the Kakyoin vs DIO fight, DIO got up close and personal to Kakyoin, and proceeded to kiss him, while changing a line that  DIO said to Jonathan in the boat. If you've seen JOJO you know which one.  I proceeded to kick them from the rp, and had to find new people to fill the gaps, as this was a long term rp. Also they had terrible grammar, then they got into my DMS, (This was Discord) and yelled at me about not wanting erp. Blocked, and started anew.",

            "selftext": "So another story from my faction rp server, from the same person even! Yeah they joined back and once again were cringe. They recently left though for some reason. \n\nThis rp took place months ago between me, a friend of mine and him \n\nI just copied and pasted it directly from the discord so you get the accurate experience \n\nHim: *a power surge would suddenly appear around Jupiter it looks like something has activated*\n\nMe: *Both the Martian Congressional Republic and United Nations detect this and send ships to investigate, the MCR sending a Donnager-class battleship with 6 Morrigan-class destroyers and 3 Corvette-class frigates as escort, the UN sends a Truman-class dreadnought, a Leonidas-class battleship and 12 Roosevelt-class escorts.*\n\nHim: *the station looking thing would be visible to them it had no seen weapons and no docking bays it also seemed to be divided into four segments*\n\nMe: *Both the Donnager-class and Truman-class battleships hail it over tight beam communications.*\n\n\u201dThis is the MCRN Hotspur, you have violated EMC space, identify yourselves immediately or we will open fire.\u201d\n\n*The UN message was much the same other than them identifying themselves as the UNN  Thomas Prince.*\n\nHim: *they would receive noting back other than static till* \u201cjendjnsnsj.\u201d *it was an unnown langue and it sounded prerecorded*\n\nMe: *The two captains mute their connection with the alien ship and open a channel between their two ships.*\n\nUNN Captain: \u201dThey\u2019ve attempted communication however it\u2019s in an unknown language we can\u2019t decipher, for all we know they could be saying \u201cwe come in peace\u201d or \u201csurrender to us,\u201d I say we go to combat alert just in case it\u2019s the latter.\u201d\n\nMCRN Captain: \u201dI agree, we\u2019ve also been getting a lot of extraterrestrial visitors as of late, I say we make a show of force to tell the wider galaxy we aren\u2019t someone they can just kick around.\u201d\n\nUNN Captain: \u201dI agree, this ship seems to be automated anyways, if they come looking for it we\u2019ll just throw a moderately sized asteroid their way as payment.\u201d\n\nMe: *The two fleets go to combat alert and seeing that they\u2019re at 1000km, torpedo range, they fire fast moving torpedos at the alien ship, ones they don\u2019t have any hope of dodging since they were built to operate in space like a sane person would build torpedos, they\u2019d need to be intercepted.*\n\nHim: *the station would begin to rotate causing a few of the torpedo to miss but most would hit leaving some damage but they would reveal an interior that was now open*\n\nMe (ooc): (They can\u2019t miss because you rotated a little)\n\nHim (ooc): (Well more of spin but yeah\n\nMe (ooc): (Even if they go through a gap they\u2019ll just come around for another pass. These are space torpedoes not atmospheric ones).\n\nHim (ooc): (Ok but still you can now enter the station.\n\nMe: *The torpedoes that \u201cmissed\u201d come back around and strike the other side, the fact that none of them were shot down shows the coalition fleet that this vessel has no form of PDCs or other countermeasures which will be noted down for future engagements. They assess the damage and search for alien bodies just in case they made a misjudgement about this ship being automated.*\n\nHim: *they would find body\u2019s but they were long dead killed by some sort of virus they dat back to ancient Egypt but their weapons technology seem at lest 10 years ahed of anything they have atm*\n\nMe: *Well they don\u2019t know that, they assumed they just fired on a crewed ship and killed some  aliens, this isn\u2019t good but they haven\u2019t detected any transmissions out of the system.*\n\n*The Martians launch skiffs with light and recon marines so they can at least get some data from them before they cover this up by nuking the ship.*\n\nHim: \u201dsynchronization complet in 2 minutes.\u201d *this would suddenly burst out on all the ships in the area* \u201cthe great purge has happened 4 times now.\u201d\n\n(I then went to the washroom for like two minutes, in that time he pinged me twice) \n\nMe (ooc): (Ping me one more time and I\u2019ll nuke them now)\n\nHim (ooc): (Pls don\u2019t\n\nFriend (ooc): // ping him, // D O I T\n\nHim (ooc): (No I\u2019m impatient sometimes\n\nMe: *The fact that they were speaking English now spooked the ships enough that they loaded their nuclear missiles now and got a target lock on them, all that they waited for was the MMC marines to finish their task.*\n\n*Both the recon and light marine squads boarded the alien vessel and began looking around for the computer core for them to bring back with them.*\n\nHim: \u201dsynchronization in one minute raising shields nuclear treat detected engaging scan.\u201d *the second the recon and light marines boarded a a light blue ran up and down their body\u2019s four times* \u201cspecies confirmed humans making adjustments for ease of use.\u201d *the hallways would begin to turn and shift making things easier for them to walk around in*\n\nMe: \u201dThis damn ship is alive...\u201d *one of the marines said as they all continued onwards in their search for the computer core.*\n\n*The coalition fleet is baffled as the alien ship forms some kind of energy barrier around itself, they order the marines to find some way of disabling it after they\u2019ve secured the computer core.*\n\nHim: \u201dsynchronization in 50 seconds.\u201d *the marines would find a computer core but it was very much not moving anytim soon*\n\nMe: *They\u2019d attempt to cut it out as carefully as possible while half the team breaks off to find whatever is generating this energy field around the ship.*\n\nHim: \u201dI canot allow you do that.\u201d *it would suddenly be as stern as a angy parent*\n\nMe: \u201dWhen I was drafted I never expected I\u2019d have to deal with alien SKYNET,\u201d *one of the marines said as they got into a defensive formation in case a terminator actually did decide to try and take them down.\u201d\n\nHim: *the gravity would suddenly invert causing the troops to slam onto the ceiling* \u201csynchronization in 20 seconds readying primary combat system.\u201d\n\nMe: *The Marines stand up but considering they\u2019re now upside down they won\u2019t be able to get at the computer core,* \u201cthis ain\u2019t worth it, bravo team you better be shutting that field down right about now this damn thing is about to come online!\u201d \n\n*Bravo team had arrived at the shield generator but considering they too were on the ceiling now they had to resort to firing at it with their guns and the recon marines micro missiles.*\n\nHim: *before bravo team could destroy snake like robots would have disabled their ability to by contructing them and the other team could see snake like robots slowly approaching* \u201csynchronization 10 seconds.\u201d\n\n(He proceeded to add these \u201csnake like robots\u201d to his factions info after using them on my guys but I let it slide)\n\nMe: *The recon marines missiles are fired from the back of their power armour so while their arm mounted rotary guns are unable to fire the missiles destroy the generator.*\n\nHim: \u201dsynchronization complete welcome aboard the rift gate #32948 we hope you enjoy you stay.\u201d *the gravity would return to normal and the snake like robots would go away but the computer core had also entered some sort of lockdown behind even heavier armor a beautiful swirl of of colors could be seen by the fleet it was mesmerizing to say the lest*\n\nMe: *Several crew members aboard both fleets had instinctively shielded themselves with their hands but after a few moments they slowly lowered them.* \u201cW-we aren\u2019t dead?\u201d\n\n*The marines pick themselves up after gravity is restored to normal before looking around for those robot snake things.*\n\nHim: *they could now see everything in the room very clearly so many body\u2019s no blood killed by some kind of virus on the outside room windows could be seen lighting up*\n\nMe: *The Marines grab a couple of the bodies and bring them back to their skiffs as for the first time human scientists will be able to study humanoid alien biology.*\n\nHim: *the station would remain active* \u201cplan e02q3 is to be engaged engaging synchronization to ichora.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201dWhat the hell does that mean? Alpha squad to fleet, is everyone alright over there?\u201d \n\nMCRN Captain: \u201cCopy alpha squad, the station has yet to return fire.\u201d\n\nUNN Captain: \u201dWhatever you did over there dropped the barrier it formed around itself, if needed we could take it out, of course not with you aboard.\u201d\n\n\u201dGlad to hear the Earthers aren\u2019t going to stab us in the back today.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201dsynchronization to ichora complete pls enter in ten minutes if you do not force will be used.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201dEnter what? And we don\u2019t take threats lightly, if you use force against Martian or Earth ships we will nuke ETs ass back home!\u201d\n\nHim: \u201dthis is non violent simply requesting enter of ichora the place of hero\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201dWhat the fuck does \u201cichora\u201d mean? Being vague about this isn\u2019t going to make us want to any more than before.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201dit is a world one hidden form conflict and evil where were hero\u2019s are putto rest till they are once again needed that is ichora this trip will be one way who ever enters may not return.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201dYeah fuck that, I\u2019d rather spend a day on the ring station than take a one way trip to an alien planet,\u201d *two of the marines continue cutting the computer core out while the others grab any loose tech laying around before bringing it to their skiffs.*\n\n*The fleet outside is still on standby to fire once the marines disembark and if the station tries anything.*\n\nHim: \u201dthen it will be done by force.\u201d * it would begin sucking only one skiff in it was doing it very slowly taking its time*\n\nMe: *That skiff fought against it with its engines, the remaining marines finally cut the core loose and carried it to their skiff before disembarking from the station, the fleet couldn\u2019t nuke the station with them so close so the marines had an idea, they clamped the other skiff to the bottom of the one being pulled in and they both fired their engines giving them enough propulsion to get far enough away.*\n\nUNN Captain: \u201dThe Skiffs are away, fire nuclear salvo!\u201d\n\nMCRN Capitan: \u201dYou heard them fire nukes!\u201d\n\n*Both flagships of the fleet fire nuclear missiles at the station, on impact they create a blinding flash of light that engulfed their scopes for a moment before it dissipated.*\n\n(He then proceeded to say that the station sucked in a civilian ship before exploding, he deleted the message instead of editing it so I can\u2019t post it here)\n\nMe (ooc): (Why would a civilian ship wander into a military controlled area, if one was there I would\u2019ve said so, edit that out)\n\nFriend(ooc): // can I just:  a r r I v e?\n\nMe (ooc): (What)\n\nFriend (ooc): // I mean: c a n I com e h e r e?\n\nMe (ooc): (Uh sure)\n\nFriend: A small Corvette exited hyperspace. It was supposed to be a routine exploration mission, but they had gone astray.\n\n(My friend and I then had a good first contact rp but considering it\u2019s good I\u2019ll just skip to when HE returns) \n\nHim (ooc): (Wait one last thing I should do\n\nHim: *the station would begin overloading and drifting into the near by gas giant Jupiter if not stopped it could make another star*\n\n(My only guess is that he was fucking pissed I didn\u2019t let him capture my people so he was going to try and fuck me over unnecessarily)\n\nFriend: The crewmembers spotted the thing.\n\"Hey, do you see that?\"\n\"Its drifting near a gas giant. \n\"Call reinforcements, we cant stop it on our own.\"\n\nMe: *The fleet fires another salvo of plasma torpedoes this time and railguns as well.*\n\nFriend: Shortly after, A Giar-class exits Hyperspace, flanked by two Adellios-classes. They were heading right for the station, deeming it a threat.\n\nHim: *the salvo would have struck the reactor causing a like leading to its overload to drastically decrease in time need till it goes boom* \n\nFriend: The Adellios-classes fire two Neumatter torpedoes in quick unison at the reactor, to completely destroy it and prevent the explosion.\n\nMe: *The fleet fires another full salvo of nukes and pelts the station with more railgun rounds.*\n\n(He then said it blew up but WIND was going to conveniently blow \u201cfallout\u201d towards my two capital planets of Earth and Mars, let me remind you that we\u2019re in the vacuum of space where wind doesn\u2019t exist, he again just deleted the message rather than editing it).\n\nMe (ooc): (No cut the \u201cradiation storm,\u201d that\u2019s not how radiation works in space, there\u2019s no wind to carry fallout.) \n\nHim (ooc): fine\n\nHim: *it would explode sending millions of bits of derby at smallest 1 nano meter and biggest a pencil at thousands of miles per minute*\n\nFriend: The Souarians would raise shields and try to minimise their damage by facing towards the debris field. The corvette went behind them.\n\nMe (ooc): (Ok that\u2019s more realistic debris is an issue when things are nuked)\n\nMe: *The fleet would fire another salvo of torpedoes which detonate at the edge of the debris cloud blowing the chunks away and into smaller less dangerous pieces, the EMCN fleet however flips and burns away from the battle field and hails the Souarians to follow them.* \n\nFriend: The Souarians turn and follow, maintaining in close formation. These were some of the most powerful ships ever made.\n\nHim (ooc): (Also good job you destroyed one of three gates to ichora\n\n(Cope)\n\nMe (ooc): (It tried taking my people so I\u2019m justified in doing so).\n\nHim (ooc): (Yeah fair but expected solariums to show up later to investigate and being rebuilding it mostly cause ichora is to them basically heaven so yeah they will come to fix it but not pick a fight\n\nMe (ooc): (The humans aren\u2019t going to want it in their system and I doubt there\u2019s much left to repair it with.)\n\nHim (ooc): (Well build a new one and this is one of three systems that have paths to ichora for rift gates to use). \n\nSo without asking, decided my home system (sol) is one of three systems to have some wormhole for his gates to use, basically giving him a way into my most important system without any trouble.",

            "selftext": "Newsflash to all you weirdos: RP search sites ARE NOT DATING APPS!\n\nThere\u2019s apparently people who use roleplay to find someone to date. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they were upfront about it when approaching potential partners, but no. These people present as totally normal roleplayers... at first.\n\nMaybe some of you know what I\u2019m talking about. In my experience, they have a pretty standard pattern of behavior.\n\n1. They\u2019re super friendly and try to get really close, really soon. A month in and you\u2019re practically their therapist. Mental illness? Family issues? Childhood trauma? You know it all after 30 days.\n\n2. They overshare personal IRL details. Pictures, full name, city, where they work/study, etc.\n\n3. Typically push to be \u201cfriends\u201d outside of rp even when you\u2019re hesitant. Might try to get your socials, do non-roleplay things together, or beg to voice chat.\n\n4. Like clockwork: a few months in the (INCESSANT) flirting starts.\n\nNewsflash number two: shocker alert, but everyone knows what you\u2019re doing. Overtly flirtatious comments 24/7? Sending frequent selfies (and even *thirst traps)?* Constantly bemoaning the fact that you\u2019re single? Up-selling your SO-quality skills? Sending hundreds of messages per day? **You are not subtle.**\n\nOccasional friend-flirting is one thing. But, unreciprocated, it becomes harassment at a certain point. If you find yourself \u201ccatching feelings\u201d for your roleplay partner of a few months (or less!), take a step back.\n\nAre you projecting your loneliness onto this writing partnership? Are you using your roleplay partner to fill the hole of a missing SO in your life? Would your personal advances/comments be inappropriate for a workplace friendship? If you answered yes to any of the above: **STOP!** \n\nI\u2019m so tired of this. Please tell me I\u2019m not alone in dealing with it. This has happened to me **four times** in the last 7 + 1/2 years and the most recent example has made me consider resigning from rp as a whole.",

I do that sometimes with friends I *know* and they do it back. It's cool. We vibe. Okay.   \n\n\nIt's when it's in DMs that I think I get the most skeeved out. I have this one friend who does this all the time, and I don't know how to deal with it, so I just stop responding or give a little \"lol\" and ignore it. But he escalates. It's just so cringe-inducing. At some point, it escalated into   \n\n\n::fondles her on his bed::   \n\n\nAnd this is a good, solid friend of mine, someone I've known for years. He's not a creep.

If you want to take it there in RP, we can, but what the fuck am I supposed to do with *that*?   \n\n\nThen he gets mad at me for \"taking it too seriously.\" I'm stumped. I like him as a person, but this just always feels SO weird. Can we not? Please? Is this normal? I remember this being a thing when I was 12 on AOL, but now? I feel like I only ever see it with this one person, who admittedly is my age and started role playing on AOL around the same time as me. Still, it's just supremely creepy at this point. When I tell him I'm uncomfortable, he gets super mad.   \n\n\nSo now I'm just wondering how normal is this? Am I just a prude or is he being as weird as it feels like he is?",

Then sit back and get ready for another Autumn rant: people not doing research into time period pieces. \n\nNow, I understand that sometimes it can be difficult to get EVERY single detail correct, and we all make minor mistakes. However, if we\u2019re doing a realistic roleplay set in the 80s... it would stand to reason that your character wouldn\u2019t have an iPhone. I\u2019ve had this happen on numerous occasions where people simply ignore what year we\u2019re in and give their characters modern gadgets/clothing wayyyyy after the character\u2019s time. \n\nThis is shorter than usual, but in conclusion, no one is asking you to be perfect in a time period piece.

Sure you hear about these things all the time but you never actually think it'll happen to you, until it does.\u00a0\n\nI sometimes find myself wondering what was my partner's mindset at the time because we were nothing to each other. We didn't have any meaningful or deep conversations outside of role-play, we didn't know each other's names or life story and the times we did speak out of character it was your usual hello and how are you? Don't get me wrong. We did have a laugh and all with each other but it was all very light-hearted. We didn't discuss anything personal or intimate.\u00a0\n\nTo sum up our relationship we were friendly to each other but we weren't friends. Sure, I was open to the possibility of friendship but it was still very early days and when I role-play with people I don't have expectations for friendship. I'm the type of person that doesn't require my partner to be my friend. At the end of the day I'm here to role-play so it doesn't bother me if my partner goes their own way.\u00a0\n\nOther than this one specific issue I had with him he was a really great partner. We were compatible with each other's writing styles, shared similar interests and were passionate about the same things. All in all he was a fantastic partner that I had the pleasure of role-playing with. Well, right up until things started getting very fucking annoying.\u00a0\n\nSo things between me and Shawn\u00a0 ((not his real name of course))\u00a0 were good for about two days until he started flirting with me. And no, we're not talking about the light-hearted, fun type of flirting. No. This guy was behaving like a boyfriend. Yeah. Creepy as fuck. Not to mention a massive turn off. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude12\u00a0\n\nHe began calling me baby, daddy's little girl and kept complementing me outside of RP.\u00a0 Shawn would also have kisses and hugs at the end of every message he sent me outside of role-play and would keep reminding me that he was indeed single and ready to mingle. Shawn also felt it was necessary to inform me that I was his ideal type in regards to personality and asked if he could see what I looked like.\u00a0\n\nI swiftly turned his request down. Not only that but I let Shawn know that I wasn't comfortable with him calling me baby, daddy's little girl, princess and so on. I also explained to Shawn that I didn't find it appropriate for him to be sending kisses and hugs at the end of every message he sends me as I didn't want him to get the wrong impression of our situation. And that situation is role-play partners'. Meaning we role-play, and only role-play.\u00a0\n\nShawn was not too happy with this but said it was ok. I left it at that and responded to the role-play. Things wen't back to normal for about a week until he acted up again. Only this time he went even further. He sent me pictures of his morning wood. Called me baby and kept talking about how he was role-playing with other girls and how wet they were after role-playing with him.\n\nYeah\u2026 no Shawn. No. I immediately put Shawn back in his place and warned him that if this was to happen again he would be blocked and reported. Shawn apologised and then disappeared for two weeks. I saw him online and role-playing with other people. I left him to it. I know I need a variety from time to time too so I assumed he was just doing the same. So I put up a role-play ad and started role-playing with other people too while waiting for his response.\n\nAnother week drags by and I wake up to a message from Shawn. In the message Shawn expressed to me that he was hurt after he discovered my role-play ad in a server we're in on Discord. He explained to me that he felt this way because I hadn't made the effort to engage in conversation with him and that he felt I had forgotten him and our role-play because I was role-playing with other people and yet I couldn't find the time to say hello to him? Which confused me because I was waiting for his response so I could continue to role-play with him and even before he vanished we didn't talk a lot anyway outside of role-play.\u00a0\n\nShawn also stated that he needed to take a step back and reevaluate the situation between us before he could make a decision whether to keep role-playing with or not. He instructed me not to contact him on any platform. To not remove myself from our role-play and to not delete our role-play server because he hadn't made his mind up yet. Shawn said that I had hurt him deeply and after all this time we spent together he couldn't believe I would be this heartless and shallow.\u00a0\n\nShawn also voiced to me that he couldn't understand why I didn't find it appropriate for him to be calling me cute pet names as he gives all his friends nicknames. Shawn preceeded to explain that he was a flirt by nature and that he meant nothing by it. He had the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't role-play erotic themes without expecting to receive dick pics as it was natural and only to be expected as I was asking for it by simply enjoying an erotic themed role-play.\n\nShawn then finished off his message by advising me to consider to stop role-playing. Apparently women who enjoy erotic role-play are a dick tease by nature and that not only are we asking for it but we want it. We want to see their dick. We want to be violated and have our boundaries disrespected.\u00a0\n\nMy response? I expressed to Shawn that I was greately concerned for his emotional and mental well-being as he seemed to be a boy trapped inside a man's body. That he had Peter Pan syndrome. I reasoned with Shawn that not only should he seek out psychiatric help for his little boy mentality but that it was also within his best interest, and overall health, to follow up with an STD examine as anybody with that mindset of women surely have kept themselves busy inside the bedroom. I finished that lovely little note off wishing Shawn a speedy recovery in his mental health and physical well-being. And that I would pray for him everyday not to go outside with a bullet proof vest because if he doesn't he's asking to be killed.\u00a0\n\nAnd then I blocked him.\n\nOn second thought, Shawn wasn't an ideal role-play partner. \ud83e\udd23",

            "selftext": "Hopefully I'm following all the rules here for my first post in this sub\n\nTl;dr - Getting back into RP after a hiatus, didn't respond to prospective 1x1 partner for 10 minutes while I was preoccupied, proceeded to get passive-aggressive messages followed by an extremely toxic paragraph. \n\nSo I'm not exactly new to rp - I've hopped around PBP forums since I was young and have always been willing and eager to learn and grow in this hobby of mine. However, it's probably been about 4-5 years since I've done any RP in earnest (I got discouraged after a great A:TLA group I was a part of tried to stay together over four different sites and it just fizzled out for a myriad reasons)\n\nAnyway, 2020 was a super rough on me and I felt like my social skills had taken a big hit. So recently, I decided to dip my toes back into RP since it was always a comforting hobby and I've met some of my best friends through fun, low-pressure RPs. I didn't want to sign up for a new forum since I'm without a proper computer and I always fear that it'll be shut down for whatever reason once I'm actually having fun, so I just got Discord for my mobile and have been trying to do 1x1 with people from all corners of the internet\n\nEarlier tonight, I decided to hop on to everyone's favorite anonymous roulette chat site with the roleplay tag on. That's probably why my luck was so bad. I'll admit, I enjoy a little ERP and was looking for a nice little one-shot since that's usually the kind of thing people on that site are looking for. I happened upon someone looking for a longterm, story driven erp, but they only dropped their Discord with what they were looking for before disconnecting. I figure \"why not?\"\n\nSo I add them, and the initial message I get from them is a very terse \"What do you want?\", which should have been the first red flag (they did apologize a few messages after, but it just didn't read as genuine). I let them know what I was into, they happened to have a starter that I liked, but I wanted to have a little OOC chat with them before getting started. I was brainstorming with them about adjusting the timeline, getting ideas on how to tailor an OC of my own to compliment theirs, and generally just trying to suss out the vibe\n\nI'm usually very relaxed during OOC talk and I speak like I would in a text (dropped periods, a \"haha\" to emphasize my lighthearted nature, fairly quick responses). We're a dozen messages in and it seems chill. Then I get a little ping from my phone and see I've got a message from a friend I haven't spoken to in a few weeks. I immediately go to their message, still waiting on this Discord person's response. I'm not pressed for time and I figure since we didn't start the rp I had some time to catch up with my friend. Should I have left Discord user a \"Hey brb,\" or something similar? Probably, but it's 2021; I hardly \"brb\" anyone anywhere.\n\nI see one new Discord notification pop up while I'm talking to my friend. I figured I could get back to them in a little bit since I wanted to take some pictures of the falling snow for my friend. About ten minutes after that first Discord notification, I get another one, so I jump back in to see a \"goodbye, I guess\" message. I did feel a little bad for leaving them hanging, but it was ten minutes. I message them back, apologizing and letting them know I was just talking to my friend.\n\n\"I don't care about your friend.\"\n\nOkay, yikes. So I try to explain to them that I like taking my time on roleplays (I'm used to a 7-day deadline for groups and a 3-day deadline 1x1; I don't ever take that long usually, but it's a nice pad for Random Acts of God) and that while I was interested in the story idea, I wasn't going to ignore my friend, with whom I have a good rapport with, to focus on OOC planning.\n\n\"So why even bother asking all those stupid questions from before?\"\n\nJesus H. White Christ. Slow your roll, sis, it's just a brainstorming sesh. And it was ten minutes. Like, what if I had left my phone on my charger while I went to the bathroom? Are they gonna tell me to control my bodily functions better? I'm a little peeved and not in the mood to deal with someone this aggro over having to wait ten minutes for a response. Trying to be as non-confrontafional as possible, I send her a message saying, \"Okay, I have a feeling this isn't going to work out between the two of us if you're going to be this upset over ten minutes. I hope you find someone else tonight. Sorry if I wasted your time.\" Sent it and blocked her account after taking a few breaths.\n\nHardly thirty seconds later, I get a friend request on Discord. Still kind of reeling, I thought that maybe this was a new user who saw a post I'd made elsewhere. I added them, sent a greeting, and I'm immediately being berated by this user that I quickly realize is the person I just blocked using a secondary account just to yell at me. They're saying things like \"You're a terrible dom\" (we hadn't even started the rp) and \"I hope your friend gets hit by a bus\". I'm immediately blocked. I guess they just wanted to get the last word in.\n\nFor the most part, I'm just taking this in stride. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, it probably won't be the last, but it just irked me a bit since I haven't really seen behavior like this since I was on Gaia way back when and, as someone trying to get back into a hobby that I enjoy, it just made me feel a little discouraged that someone would react like that. \n\nAgain, maybe I should have dropped a \"brb\", but it just feels superfluous to say that in 2021 when you're just brainstorming with someone. I'm also not going to let some random I just met take precedence over a friend I've known for far longer. Even on PBP forums when I'd be messaging potential writing partners, there was kind of an unspoken acknowledgment that people have lives outside of the RP and that you may have to wait a bit to hear back. Had I been gone for, let's say, an hour without sending them a quick \"Hey, I'm preoccupied right now\", maybe I'd understand their rage a little more, but I just don't think it's worth the high blood pressure to get that vindictive over ten minutes of radio silence. It made me wonder if we did start an rp, were they going to monitor my away time and get angry that I didn't immediately start on a response the moment 8 hours had passed from a \"last post, going to bed, will reply to new posts tomorrow\"?\n\nI don't know, y'all. AITA for not letting them know that I was talking to my friend as soon as possible? Was I being misleading by not stating right off the bat that \"Hey, I just want to have a fun ERP, but I'm not going to be able to respond immediately at all times if this is going to be a longterm play\"? Was I in the wrong for immediately blocking their first account when I felt uncomfortable with how they reacted to something that's such a non-issue to me and other writing partners I've had?\n\nMajor apologies to anyone who's made it this far down, but I appreciate you if you did take the time to read it. I was just irritated and this sub just happened across my path while the confusion was still fresh in my head and I just wanted to vent it out, maybe get another pair of eyes on the situation to see if my lax attitude justified a reaction like that.",

And the limits they set for RPs are not \"challenges\". \n\nAs a male, I don't normally speak on the behalf of women because I don't believe it's my place. But I have a very close irl friend on reddit and they're also an RPer. And apparently, her limits against rape and gore rps were seen as a challenge by a certain abortion of nature. This individual plainly crossed these boundaries and then blamed my friend for getting mad at him because apparently \"your limits were just goals you set because you're playing hard to get\". \n\nAnd this is a message to the guys who constantly cross these boundaries, to you specifically. I can't say you'll ever be put in jail, I can't say you'll ever be physically hurt. All I can say is.... you will never have a life worth celebrating.",
