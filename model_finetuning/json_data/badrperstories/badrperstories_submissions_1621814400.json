This girl on another app messaged me asking to roleplay a fandom we are both in. I asked her the basic questions to find out she only does OCxCanon characters. I typically won\u2019t do this as it\u2019s just not as fun for me. But, I love this exploring this character and wanted to give it a shot. Then, she sends me her OC. I could over look the clear underwhelming feeling I got from of this OC just to see if she was any good. But, the character I\u2019m suppose to be playing is a gay man. Being a gay man and the struggles alongside of this is a very crucial part to his character development and backstory. But, she\u2019s asking me to play him as a straight man in a romantic RP with her character. Am I the only one who finds this wrong and maybe even slightly offensive? Or am I just being too personal about it as I relate to the character.",

            "selftext": "I honestly don't know what to flare this as, but I think venting works. \n\nHello, everyone I'm D and I'm 20 years old. \n\nI tend to not speak to minors who aren't related to me especially on the internet especially in regards to roleplay, but I took a chance this one single time because it wasn't like i was trying to rp with them. \n\nJust a chat. \n\nNow I'd posted something about wanting to talk about roleplay and roleplay characters because i love OOC talk about that stuff. Plotting is my favorite part, gets me excited to see the character dynamic! So I get messages and blah blah, but two in particular were minors. \n\nOne told me : \" I'm 16, soon to be 17 \" and I mull it over. Then I'm like okay, I mean, it's not like we're actually going to roleplay. We can chat about characters. \n\nBut the other I didn't know until I asked because their behavior didn't seem like that of an adult. \n\nRed flags : when I didn't answer immediately they would wait a bit before messaging ?, I would have to egg them on to speak (as I said they could gush, but would stop messaging after like 2 sentences), they have some stereotypical OCs they ship with fandom characters, they would not really give me anything to respond to at times lmao like just a \"Yep\".\n\nBut I only started realizing something was probably up with them being a minor when he tried to interrogate me on knowing something so I disappeared a sec to tell someone and he did a \n\nBro?\nU there?\nThere?\n\nSo big red flag again! And I just wanted to make sure. And my suspicions are confirmed as soon as they say beat around it. In my experience minors either say \" I'm a minor \" or they beat around it or say \" isn't that personal? \" While adults, because it's rp yk, say their age! Finally they tell me specific age without me asking. A \"I'm a minor\" would've sufficed. I'd know what I could say and what I couldn't yk, because minor. \n\nBut anyway! \nThey messaged me the next day saying they couldn't get any hits on a post looking to rp. I didn't respond because I had things to do so I checked the NEXT day. And saw they got a hit so I mentioned it and this is when shenanigans ensue. \n\nBecause I didn't understand something they ended up calling me a bitch which I didn't appreciate. I was really confused about a situation regarding their displeasure of not getting hits because I'd checked their post and they'd gotten one so I mentioned it. Which lead to the whole bitch thing after a while. They were acting like I was stupid because I didn't get it and after a while I gave up and explained that I was going to leave it alone and it was no problem. And they immediately thought I was blocking them. Which I wasn't and didn't. \n\nIt was just a weird encounter. I don't want to not include children in roleplaying, just be weary of them. I suppose you'd need more patience than I have.",

These are all things I respect and try not to be nit-picky about.\n\nHowever I have noticed I often will make a character who has a specific hobby, appearance, and sense of style. Then maybe a week or so later my partner will introduce a character with a lot of similarities to mine with minor differences placed in. This goes as far as similar lifestyles, colorschemes, clothing deigns, etc. While I know not ever idea is original it does trouble me mainly because when this is done, my partner treats the character that they used ideas kind of poorly afterwards. Such as ignoring things I mention about them, or bringing the spotlight onto their character. Despite me mentioning these traits way before they had introduced theirs. Its come to the point where I feel like I might blow up on them if it continues. I don\u2019t know if this is common amongst rpyers and while I do my best to keep an open mind. It is frustrating to feel someone is trying to make it seem like my character is an inconvenience to theirs despite mine being there first.",

            "selftext": "I responded to this persons ad, we got into DMs onto another site and started to discuss the roleplay. We set up the plot, themes, characters, where we wanted this roleplay to go, response length. During the set up, they asked if we could go on mic to \u201ctalk dirty\u201d which I declined as I had just met the person, wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and just wanted to get on with the RP. Albeit, the RP itself was sexual, but still. They said they respected that, but then kept asking about it, if I was sure and if I\u2019d be open to it later. I kept saying no, and eventually they dropped it. \n\nEventually, we began the roleplay. We shared a couple responses, maybe 2 each. Suddenly, they say they have to cut the RP because I was using first person. We didn\u2019t discuss that previously mind you, and to be fair, she was using third, however she was playing multiple characters. I then said that I would happily change the perspective, and that we should just discuss these things instead of just cutting the RP. I didn\u2019t get a response after that. They haven\u2019t blocked me as I can still see they\u2019re active. \n\nI don\u2019t know if stuff like this happens often. You start a roleplay that fits what you\u2019re looking for, the partner seems just right, you begin and they ghost you or cut it over something simple like that. I understand that things like perspective can be an issue for some people, but it was something we never discussed, not to mention they let it go on for a couple messages instead of telling me after the first. Anyway, rant over. I just had to get that out my system, it was just frustrating.",

What do you want your character to be?\" And then they say werewolf too without any reasoning behind it other than they can't think of anything else. This is not an assumption, this is what I've been told.\n\nMaybe it's just that I've had a hyperfixation on mythical creatures for basically my whole life but...really?

            "selftext": "I use the NSFW flair just in case, though I'm not sure if it's actually needed.\n\nSo I've met this guys about 7 years ago in an MMORPG. Through him I got into roleplaying and it became one of my favorite hobbies actually. Later on we continued our RP on another platform because we both stopped playing that MMO.\n\nWe both created OCs, tinkered on them for quite a long time and the characters grew on me a lot. They started out as strangers becoming business partners, later partners in crime and in the end lovers. Their story was one long play which lasted about 5 years. \n\nNow, I'm someone who likes to keep RL and RP seperate. Especially when I know that the person I'm doing the RP with isn't someone who I'd actually get along with in RL. But if you're playing for such a long time, then you automatically start to build some kind of OOC relationship. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a friendship, but I guess you know what I mean. We asked how the other one is doing, little fun stories about our day to day life, he told me about that sweet woman he met at work and how they didn't last long, and mostly he vented a lot about his job. Tbh I was never really interested in these kind of infos, nor have I shared these kind of private details about my life with him. But I guessed that he just needed someone to talk to and I was happy to be there for him.\n\nAfter 5 years I decided to stop the RP. His job is quite stressful. Whenever he vented about it even I got stressed from just listening to him. He has to travel a lot, he has to plan shifts for the workers in the company, etc. And because of that job he kept ditching me. I don't have an issue with not getting any replies for days or even couple weeks. But I hate it with a passion when someone asks me to make time for them, when they just don't show up themself. This kind of stuff started to happen more often. So I stopped the RP.\n\nNow, 2 years later he reached out to me again. Told me he has a better job now, more time on his hands and that he misses our RP and OCs. He asked me to continue our RP and I said I would give it another go when we keep RL and RP seperated and when he won't ditch me all the time again. He agreed to my terms and we started another setting/plot with the same OCs. A fresh start if you will.\n\nThings went fine for about 2-3 months, until I noticed that his old behavior came up again. He didn't show up when we made plans, let me waiting for nothing, etc. But now he developed a new behavior on top of that: IF he showed up to our planned RP, he would do ERP. Tbh I'm not having an issue with writing smut, the characters are lovers, they've done the deed before, whatever. But what started to annoy me is that he would come online, initiate an ERP and after that he would go offline again because he has to work the next day. He would promise to continue the actual plot the next day, but didn't show up. And I know that he faps during those plays. He told me back in the days, even though I asked him to not tell me. For me it's just an RP, I don't want to know whether or not my partner is beating his meat.\n\nIn the beginning I thought that this situation would be an exception and boy was I wrong with that. Whenever he came online he would write smut 90% of the time while the plot just became more and more unimportant. If he talked to me OOC, it would only be to vent about his job and coworkers. Seriously, ongoing monologues about *his life* and *his job* , without me being able to say a single word other than ''uhum''. \n\nAnd now I'm just pissed. I loved this RP for such a long time. I saw how the beloved characters developed and grew. I wanted to stop the RP before, but hoped that it would be just a phase for my partner. That things would go back to normal again and that we could continue fleshing out the world we built together.\n\nSo I confronted him about this, told him that I do not appreciate getting my time wasted. That he shouldn't ask me to make some time for him, when he doesn't show up afterwards and that I want more than smut for these characters. But my partner isn't responding. He probably sees my reaction as just another stress source and doesn't want to deal with the consequences of his behavior.",

            "selftext": "I want to start off this post by saying that I know what I did was extremely petty and no one in this situation did the \"right\" thing.\n\nA few years ago I ran an original rp server on Discord. Quite a few people joined in and helped making the setting feel alive. It was a blast for a while. Before setting up this server, an old buddy of mine had found me on Discord. We used to roleplay on Jcink forums, but I've stayed far away from those rps for a while because of the constant drama and faceclaims culture in those rps. We talked for a bit and decided that we wanted to roleplay together again. I've never been good at 1x1, so I made this original server and invited my buddy to come mod with me.\n\nOne day, this obnoxious girl joined the server. She got on our nerves from the beginning and my buddy who usually never trash talked, confined in me how he disliked this girl. I was still new to modding discord servers and decided to give her a chance instead of just kicking her. She actually turned out to be pretty okay, so much so, that I developed a crush on her. I eventually told her and our flirtatious cheasing each other turned into having feelings for one another.\n\nNever mix those kinds of feelings with roleplay, never.\n\nWe lived in two different countries, but we were both in Europe and besides, one of my best buddies has a serious partner in another country in Europe, so maybe that could work for me too? We talked on voice chat a lot and before I knew it, this girl wanted to come visit me in my country. I figured it would be cool because then I could meet her face to face and see if I felt anything for her in person.\n\nI just want to point out that we were not in a relationship at any point. We were simply having fun with flirtatious banter. I don't believe in relationships with someone you've never met in real life, at least not serious ones. What may work over text, doesn't always work in person and I've found this out the hard way before. In my opinions, having relationships online and calling each other \"my girl/boyfriend\" is extremely juvenile.\n\nBut the thing about this girl was that she was moving incredibly fast. This server hadn't even been alive for a month, and she were making plans to come visit me? Nope. My anxiety just went through the roof and I told her to stay away. I thought she understood. I'd been pretty up front about struggling with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to a point where I can't even go shopping because I physically can't breathe. It's sometimes I've struggled with all of my life and the fact that I was struggling with alcohol at the time as well did not help ease my anxiety.\n\nWelp.\n\nI found out later, that this girl did not understand at all. Behind my back, she had complained to my old buddy (there's a reason I mentioned him at the beginning and here it comes) and somehow he tried to defend me while also agreeing with her that I had overreacted about not wanting her to come visit me. So, I decided to talk to her, explained my situation and we tried to ease things up with some video games. I invited her to come play with my and my best friend, so we met up in this social/meeting hub in the game. I wanted to show my friend a secret in the hub and started doing all the steps for that secret to pop up, but this other girl kept getting in my way and on voice chat, she thought she was funny with her, \"what are you going to do, huh, you little bitch?\" but it actually pissed me off to such an extend that I had to log off and leave the voice chat without a word.\n\nFor a while, I didn't really speak to this girl or my buddy. That was until I found out that this girl had started dating my buddy and his girlfriend. I should probably mention here that I do believe in polyamorous relationships. My other real life friend that I mentioned earlier in a long distance relationship also has another serious partner in another country. That wasn't my issue with it. I was more pissed about the fact that my old buddy had kept going off about how he didn't like this girl and when I told him that I thought I was crushing on her, he was the one who told me to go for it. I don't care about bros before anything else, but it just felt wrong why he would suddenly be in a relationship with her when he disliked her and knew I'd had feelings for her. Turns out, it was his girlfriend who was good friends with this girl on my server who convinced him. He straight up told me that they'd talked about it and that she'd told him that she would never accept him being with another girl and that she wouldn't want to be with anyone else either. But suddenly it was okay when it was this girl who were their friend? I felt so annoyed with the hypocrisy and how my buddy couldn't see that she was manipulating him. I threw shit and the already shit covered fan that was whirling away like a jet engine in our conversation,",

Anything else due to the fact they get more hours in the day to play stuff as opposed to me, often times they are so far ahead of me in any other MMO type game we had found before that I can never catch up, so we would mostly do text RP together.)\n\nThis has gone on for a long long while, years and years, to where I would know their habits a bit and I wouldn\u2019t mind if things got delayed a day or two because of life. Then just all of a sudden about 3 months ago the replies just stopped.\n\nMe and the partner still talk to this day on occasion, we have good days and rare bad days where it feels like I can struggle to get even a word out of her of input on stuff I\u2019ve been working on too, so I try to still be there as a friend. But I try to ask her about what is wrong, or ask her if she is still interested in writing. Heck, even find out if there is something that maybe I didn\u2019t leave enough for them for my last reply so I ask to see if there is anything I need to edit/modify, and all of that keeps getting met with radio silence. The lack of communication from them about the treads has been hurting a lot and I dunno what else to do.\n\nThe worst part is that I tried to accept it and move on, since even then I still RPd on different outlets as well (but still always put their threads first over anywhere else.) But I feel like ever since this had happened, my own drive for writing or doing anything creative like artwork has dropped dramatically elsewhere too. I\u2019m literally at a loss because it feels like all of my energy and creativity is tied to this person and this period of nothing from them has thrown me into a slump I cannot escape from no matter how I try. Tho what should I do now when it comes to talking to them and such?",

I was chatting with this potential rper, tossing ideas around, and they mentioned that they'd love a rivals to lovers type of plot. I asked if they meant competitive rivals, or more business world esque rivals- they said business. Alright, sounds good. We've got some sort of base line established, the post length/activity talk out of the way. After a moment I say 'Hmmm, just thinking what kind of businessmen they should be'.  \n\n\nI thought, given context, that they would know I meant what field of work our characters would be in. After all, 'businessmen' is a super vague term. Will they be in tech, finance, design- you get the picture. I was brainstorming that, figuring we could bounce a few ideas off eachother.   \nThen, as the title says...  \nThey sent me. A link. To the dictionary definition of 'businessman', and said 'maybe this will help'.  \n\n\nI....  \nhuh? Do...they think I don't know what a businessman is? It's not like it had any examples or specific ideas on it, it was just...a fairly broad definition of a businessman. W u t? I sent back 'oh, I meant more what kind of jobs they'd do?' and this person said 'okay tell me when you've settled on something', and that's it. I haven't answered yet because I just...don't...know how? Lol, definitely one of the weirdest interactions I've recently had. Not bad, just funny.",

            "selftext": "That might be redundant but I was looking for someone with a particular kink on F-Chat and I meet this dude who has said kink. Now, I'm one to read profiles very carefully, and apologise if I misread something, mind you.\n\nBut I talk with this dude and he begins to abuse me and call me an idiot because said kink that brought his name up in the partner search (for those who don't have F-list, you can search people up by certain kinks you like and they'll come up with different names of characters who have that as a \"Fave\" or a \"Yes\")  \n\n\nSo I had enough of this dude because he obviously beats off in a mirror and loves to talk and thinks he's justified in being an asshole to me. Minutes later, I get a note from a player with \"Troll\" or something in his name.\n\nHe made light of me posting one line at a time, made fun of my character calling him \"Fat\" because the species is a hybrid that is seen as \"fat\". He then bragged in the message, also the subject line, by claiming he has \"the last laugh\". He said I was \"Petulant\", which made me feel like he looked that word up to insult me because of how awkwardly it was used, for blocking me and called me retarded because I couldn't post more than one line at a time, I'm actually exciteable and I tend to forget things I want to share for an RP idea.\n\nSo he went on to say that he was going to delete that temporary character so that I can't report it. He was so arrogant and so certain the mods weren't going to keep a record of that of created characters associated with the account he thought he would get away with it.\n\nI reported it to the mods and he got timed out for pre-emptive block evasion and abuse. This was way back before I got my undiagnosed autism diagnosed and I would usually flip out and get \\*myself\\* timed out. I had to pay myself for that self-control and rationality that I reported him instead of making myself look like an absolute fool by not emotionally engaging and reporting him.\n\nCall me petty, but I saved the log of this person getting booted from chat and timed out for a month. Because I was the one who truly had the last laugh. Especially over someone who was so fucking stupid, his arrogance deluded him into thinking he was smarter than everyone. lol no. Try again sweetie.\n\nI laughed so hard at how his \"Cunning plan\" backfired hard.",

            "selftext": "I want to start off this post by saying that I know what I did was extremely petty and no one in this situation did the \"right\" thing. I remembered this story after watching an episode of Critcrab on a LiveJournal roleplay. That episode had a statement about how romance online doesn't always work out the same way in person and it reminded me of this.\n\nA few years ago I ran an original rp server on Discord. Quite a few people joined in and helped to make the setting feel alive. It was a blast for a while. Before setting up this server, an old buddy of mine had found me on Discord. We used to roleplay on Jcink forums, but I've stayed far away from those rps for a while because of the constant drama and faceclaims culture in there. (it's crap, don't even get me started because that's a whole other dumpster fire.) We talked for a bit and decided that we wanted to roleplay together again. I've never been good with 1x1, so I made this original server and invited my buddy to come mod with me.\n\nOne day, this obnoxious girl joined the server. She got on our nerves from the beginning and my buddy who usually never trash-talked confided in me how he disliked this girl. I was still new to modding discord servers and decided to give her a chance instead of just kicking her. She actually turned out to be pretty okay, so much so, that I developed a crush on her. I eventually told her and our flirtatious teasing at each other turned into having feelings for one another.\n\nNever mix those kinds of feelings with roleplay, never.\n\nWe lived in two different countries, but we were both in Europe and besides, one of my best real-life buddies has a serious partner who lives in another country in Europe, so maybe that could work for me too? We talked on voice chat a lot and before I knew it, this girl wanted to come to visit me in my country. I figured it would be cool because then I could meet her face to face and see if I felt anything for her in person.\n\nI just want to point out that we were not in a relationship at any point. We were simply having fun with flirtatious banter that eventually turned to talk about perhaps having a crush on each other. I couldn't really know for sure without having met her. I don't believe in relationships with someone you've never met in real life, at least not serious ones. What may work over text, doesn't always work in person and I've found this out the hard way in my teens when the boy I played with online wasn't at all the same person in real life. In my opinion, having relationships online and calling each other \"my girl/boyfriend\" is extremely juvenile.\n\nBut the thing about this girl was that she was moving incredibly fast. This server hadn't even been alive for a month, and she was making plans to come to visit me? Nope. My anxiety just went through the roof and to the moon before I told her to not come. I thought she understood. I'd been pretty upfront about struggling with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to a point where I can't even go shopping because I physically can't breathe. Just doing my laundry is a journey at times because it means going outside my apartment. It's something I've struggled with all of my life and the fact that I was struggling with alcohol at the time as well did not help ease my anxiety.\n\nWelp.\n\nI found out later, that this girl did not understand at all. Behind my back, she had complained to my old buddy (there's a reason I mentioned him at the beginning and here it comes) and somehow he tried to defend me while also agreeing with her that I had overreacted about not wanting her to come to visit me. So, I decided to talk to her, explained my situation and we tried to patch things up with some video games. I invited her to come and play with me and my best friend, so we met up in this social/meeting hub in the game. I wanted to show my friend a secret in the hub and started doing all the steps for that secret to pop up, but this other girl kept getting in my way of doing these steps and on voice chat, she thought she was funny with her, \"what are you going to do, huh, you little bitch?\" but it actually pissed me off to such an extent that I had to log off and leave the voice chat without a word. It was about that time that I realized I could never develop feelings for her again.\n\nFor a while, I didn't really speak to this girl or my buddy. That was until I found out that this girl had started dating my buddy and his girlfriend. (I should probably mention here that I do believe in polyamorous relationships. My other real-life friend that I mentioned earlier in a long-distance relationship also has another serious partner in another country.) That wasn't my issue with it. I was more pissed about the fact that my old buddy had kept going off about how he didn't like this girl and when I told him that I thought I was crushing on her, he was the one who told me to go for it. I don't care about bros before anything else, but it just felt wrong why he would suddenly be in a relationship with her when he disliked her and knew I'd had feelings for her. Turns out, it was his girlfriend who was good friends with this girl on my server who'd convinced him to go into a relationship. He straight up told me that they'd talked about it and that she'd told him that she would never accept him being with another girl and that she wouldn't want to be with anyone else either. But suddenly it was okay when it was this girl who was their friend? I felt so annoyed with the hypocrisy and how my buddy couldn't see that she was manipulating him. I threw shit and the already shit-covered fan that was whirling away like a jet engine in our conversation and in an extremely petty fit of rage, I told them all to go fuck themselves before I blocked them. (I'd already handed over my server at this point because I lost interest in it with all of these emotions and drama going on behind the scenes.) \n\nI still find it incredibly juvenile that these three people decided to be in a relationship despite never having met each other in real life, but I also admit that my fit of rage, when I found out about this, was juvenile as well. When I do look back at it, I feel like this girl mistook friendship with romantic emotions and I'm glad that I never got to meet her in real life or get into an actual relationship with her.",

            "selftext": "This is a long story, and it's sad - to me, at least. I'm posting it here on a throwaway because I've got no one else to talk about it with, but my feelings won't be dealt with until I've talked about it and felt heard. So, random people of the Internet, here's a Bad RPer story.\n\nIt's not really about any particularly bad RPer, though. In fact, everyone I'll talk about it in this story is counted among the most creative people I've ever had the privilege to collaborate with. In my twenty or so years in this hobby, across IRC and forums and MUDs and emails and tabletop and MMOs, that is something I'll forever stand by. In this story of bad RPers, I'm not sure anyone is at fault. Or, perhaps everyone is. It's more a story how it can go bad for seemingly no reason, and how you may never get any answers.\n\nThe story begins about five years ago. On a whim, I rolled up a new character and took them into the public RP area of a particular MMO that I'd returned to. There, I met someone we'll call Alpha, and we immediately struck it off. We just clicked really well and spent months constructing a running, improvisational story, involving as many people as we could, working in plot twists and dramatic events, and so on. Our characters connected, our particular brand of roleplaying improvisation meshed really well, and we were interested in similar themes and storylines - and, better than that, our schedules tended to align. It was the kind of thing where people would message us and ask if we were the same person puppeting multiple characters. We did fan art and fan fiction of each other's characters, and I cherish those creations. It was a high point of my roleplaying history, and I sorely wish I'd kept logs. I genuinely believe they are one of the most creative people I've ever met.\n\nBut eventually, we fell out of contact. It happens. It sucks but it happens. This part of it is definitely on me, in fact. I've never been one to hand out ways to reach me outside whatever particular platform I'm roleplaying on. While I've long chalked it up to liking my privacy, I think it stems more from being schizoid and firmly delineating covert and overt. But, like I said, it happens, and it was my decision so the point of failure is on me.\n\nHowever, that isn't where the story ends. About three years ago, I swapped over to another MMO. A short time after getting into the public RP scene there, I received a message from - of all people - Alpha - we'd bumped into each other again! After a joyous reunion, Alpha introduced me to the people they'd been running with - who we'll call Bravo, Charlie, Delta - and brought me into the IC organization they were a part of. After getting back into the rhythm, we decided to reimagine our characters from the first MMO and started again, taking things in more interesting directions because we knew each other better. And we had a dedicated group of people to bounce off. Very quickly, we were among this network of a dozen or so people who were just stellar roleplayers able to spin together incredible stories. It was even better than when it'd really just been me and Alpha. I miss it terribly.\n\nThen, it all began to fall apart.\n\nIt's here where my version of events gets hazy. Covid had hit the world in earnest a year ago, and I won't dwell too much on it - was it a factor in the collapse? Probably. After all, for me, it brought a well-paying job that severely ate into my roleplaying hours and I spent half the year being unable to catch most people for scenes and pick-up roleplay. But by then, I'd decided to break my habit of limiting myself to platform-specific contact and had everyone on Discord. When I mentioned the change in circumstances to Alpha, they suggested keeping the characters going over Discord due to how our schedules would be tougher to align. That sounded great.\n\nIt never happened.\n\nThey never sent anything, and they never replied to anything I sent. In fact, many messages I sent - whether IC or OOC - would just not get a response. And so, I just stopped. After that, I think we went from roleplaying every fortnight to every few months. Still, if it's my schedule that's the problem, then it's on me to make the effort to work around it. And I tried, but scheduled events would pass with no one but me logging on, and that hurt. When I was able to log in more regularly again, I started to really notice that this close-knit group just wasn't interacting with each other anymore and particular characters weren't showing up for weeks or months at a time. The players were around and online but they weren't interacting with each other. Something had happened.\n\nSo, I spent most of the end of last year, when I'd ended up with a flexible WFH position that basically allowed me to get paid to RP, trying to put things back together. For months of effort, I think I managed to get only a few people together for exactly two scenes. And I was just getting bitter and angry and, to be entirely honest, depressed in a way I never had before - in a way I hope I never feel again. The lack of communication was what hurt the most. It was like everything had burnt down and I'd flung open the door to a smouldering ballroom, trying to get people to dance in the ruins. But no one would mention *why* it'd burnt down.\n\nAbout a month ago, I decided to try and figure out what happened, if only for my peace of mind, and... didn't really get anywhere. The problem with such a close-knit network is that if one node fails then the rest of it will follow. A roleplaying group is a simple complex system. If one part fails, the rest of it WILL cascade after it. And as best as I can determine, that is what happened - one set of players had a bit of drama, potentially even an OOC break-up, and that left one (or both) of them feeling burnt and hurt, so they stopped RPing. That leads to the people they interact with RPing less, which leads to more nodes failing, which leads to more nodes failing, which leads to more failures, and so on.\n\nA few weeks ago, I realized that I didn't have any positive feelings about it anymore. I'd log on and I'd just feel bitter. It's one thing to feel sad because things fall apart - it's roleplaying, it happens - but it's another to have this mixture of sadness and anger brewing in your gut because it's happened despite your best efforts. I was sad and angry and bitter - towards Alpha, towards everyone. We all know the thoughts: you say you're too busy but you're online for hours, you talk about wanting to RP but never suggest a time or date, and so on. And it hurt especially because this was a group of people who had otherwise approached things like adults. Why weren't they?\n\nSome of my favourite characters I just couldn't bear logging into anymore because their roleplay - their lives, their stories - had evaporated along with the group. They were left with story threads hanging in the wind. It's tough to endure the OOC messages asking where people are when the truthful answer is that you don't know because they don't respond. It's tougher still to finangle IC reasons. When a player stops logging into a character's SO, what do you do?\n\nAbsences happen. Inspiration can and will wax and wane. Characters will ascend and descend the rungs of creative primacy. This is all normal, and some of my favourite roleplaying memories have originated from working around those issues. But that relies on communication and trust and consideration for your fellow players. I've never begrudged anyone for being open about things and, for the most part, this group (and Alpha) had always been open.\n\nUntil recently.\n\nAfter months of existing in a liminal state, I realized that I couldn't enjoy ANY roleplaying anymore. In fact, the years of positive memories were being tainted by the negative feelings of it all. Had already been tainted. So, I walked away. I left a message explaining that I loved them, the memories, the friendships, and the joy of incredible creating, that I felt privileged and honored to be part of it for so long - but my head was clouded by negativity. For the foreseeable future, it wasn't fair to anyone if I was roleplaying with negative thoughts clouding things. And privately, I knew I'd explode if I kept waiting and hoping and - to be honest - wishing. To Alpha, I sent a private message that I was sad that we - the wider group and us specifically - had drifted apart.\n\nAlpha never responded.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI've done my best to keep this as anonymous as possible. I wanted to write more, to give a better picture, but I fear that'd start including details that might allow people to figure things out and I really don't want to risk that. Either way, I have to accept that this is how it ends. That things happened - in RP or otherwise - that 'killed' a dozen characters and their stories, some of which were quite dear to me. In a way, I'm fine with not roleplaying again. But I'm not fine with the loss of friendship. I'm not fine with never understanding why things went down the way they did - but it'll stop hurting in time. We don't always get answers. We're not always entitled to them.\n\nIf you, reader, take anything from this, then take one thing: this is a hobby that only operates between people, and good communication is the most important aspect of it. The earlier you discuss something, the earlier you can fix it or work within the confines of it to create something cool. Be kind to one and other because if we won't, then who will?\n\nI'll always remember these people, their characters and their stories. I just wish this story had a happier ending.",

I found some of their possible ideas interesting, so replied...and then they never replied to me again. I found it sort of strange and mentioned it to one of my long term partners...turns out they have a reputation for doing this? I'm not sure what I said wrong but clearly it was something.\n\nI guess they can do whatever they want, but I find it really bizarre to reach out to tons of people and then ghost them immediately and then complain you can't find partners I guess.",

            "selftext": "Here's my story I guess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm just getting off this year hiatus because I had school and stuff and I just wasn't really that driven to roleplay. I get back on an rp app, (It's the easiest place for me to find partners ;;\\_\\_;;) and I make a \"searching\" post, I get some mediocre inboxes back. I got off the app for about a week to wait for someone who actually read my rules and didn't begin with \"Hey wanna Rp?\" And, unluckily for me this guy inboxes me. I'm kinda apprehensive because he didn't have rules or that many oc's to analyze, but I decided to give him a chance. We go back and forth and come up with plot and characters and such, we roleplay and everything seems fine. He was really good on responses and he was very pleasant  out of rp, my first mistake.  \n\nNow at first I was kinda distant, but as got to know him I slowly started to care for him as a genuine friend. we switched platforms to text more conveniently and we texted even more, I slowly started feeling really happy when he texted and talked to me to the point of me having to question how intense this attraction was, (told myself that I liked him as a friend knowing full well that I had a crush on him.) so yeah, we finish our roleplay in about I dunno, a week? maybe two? and we start talking regularly. he talks about his fish and dnd and shit and i'm just there, listening to him ramble about his life, in retrospect I really have no idea why I sat there and listened to all of that. one day I actually asked him if I could ramble to him and he gives essentially a \"damn that sucks.\" type response. later in the day he blocks me on the website we switched to. I'm really confused so I hop on my alt account and ask him if I did anything wrong or if it was an accident and he responds with \" I'm not a good person, and you need to stay away from me***,*** I'm sorry\"  I should have heeded that warning lmao. I'm trying to reason with him to get him to open up on why he flaked, and he's unresponsive so I do say something manipulative. (I'm not a bad person, I just needed a response from him.) He actually ended up saying something back. He says he didn't want to complicate anything and that he's a bad person, I pry further and uncover that he had some sort of attraction to me. I confess to him, and we try to figure out what we should do further. only there was one thing wrong, we never asked for ages. I'm 17 now, turning 18 soon and he was 21 turning 22. the gap was too big for me and him and we both had to split ways, I guess he felt conflicted because before I blocked him he added me back and asked to see me because \"I wondered if I'd be attracted to you\" I thought it was weird but I did so anyways, he sent one back and a little after he called me pretty and fumbled with his words, he blocked me.  I understood why but was kinda salty it was in the middle of us talking though -\\_- \n\nso, I go along with life for about two weeks until he adds me back on my alt account. I question him and he leads on with \" I don't want to pursue a relationship with you, but I'd like to continue roleplaying with you if you're okay \" I'm just completely thrown for a loop, it was so random. But, he was the best partner I had and I wanted to keep that for a little longer. I agree and wait for him to add me, a day goes by....and so does another. I'm fed up at this point because it's like why add me just to block me again? it was annoying and weird. I edit my messages to say what I need to say and add him back so he knows. He actually accepts it to give me some \"apology\"  with my favorite part of him griping with the reality of \"wanting something he can't have\" funny stuff. as he swears to not do it again, he does it again LUL. I was completely done. \n\nfew weeks later and I vent to one of my close friends about it and i'm slowly starting to feel better about the whole thing. She smelled fishy shit reeking from my story and asked for my account that I texted him on, she snoops and does some detective work and finds some of his other social media accounts, I'm doubtful because on one he's raving about getting married and his \"wife.\" I'd never heard about any of that. but sure enough we validated it it because he posted a picture of himself with his ring. Any sentimental feeling I had for him soon washed away and I couldn't help but laugh at how silly this whole thing was. \n\nall of this dumb drama from roleplaying. makes you think. I lowkey want to confront him about it, what should I do?",

I don't want to be a god modder or have an op character. But realistically if a teacher who's older, stronger, and has more experience they wouldn't get taken down by a student who doesn't know martial arts at all. What I'm thinking is maybe the teacher just dodges their attacks and throws them around a bit, but I feel like dodging would be godmodding yk?",

Super excited, enjoying the rp so far, but my biggest qualm that is really bugging me, is that this person will respond in our OOC chat about things happening in the rp. Or they\u2019ll send a \u2018hi\u2019 message in the OOC chat but won\u2019t respond to the rp. I\u2019m totally okay with that, if I forgot to respond and it\u2019s been a couple hours or something, but it really seems this person is moreso looking for a friend than an rp partner sometimes, and I stated in my ad I\u2019m most likely not going to be up for ooc chat much, just because I\u2019m not looking for online friends (outside of like a \u2018hey I\u2019m gonna be gone for a week or so because of irl shit kind of message). \n\nAny advice for how to gently bring this up to him without upsetting him? I don\u2019t wanna come off as a jerk, but I also don\u2019t need a \u201cwoah, that was a cool story element\u201d message every time I send a response \ud83d\ude29.",

We could have a really good connection, but the problem is response times.\n\nNormally, the roleplay length goes from 2-5k characters a reply, and although my partner can write that quickly, with the exception of some minor typos, but I tend to take at least an hour to reply, my replies being with more perfected grammar, smoother transitions and normally a larger length. They said they like my writing style, but that I take a bit to write and today they said they lost the mood. We pair well, yet at the same time I'm afraid of losing my partner because of this-I've tried to go faster, yet it normally ends up stressing me out to the point where I can't properly think of my sentences.\n\nWith this I'm curious; is my partner being to expectant of me,  or am I perhaps being over-attentive with quality control or writing too much.",

            "selftext": "I want to start off this post by saying that I know what I did was extremely petty and no one in this situation did the \"right\" thing.\n\nA few years ago I ran an original rp server on Discord. Quite a few people joined in and helped making the setting feel alive. It was a blast for a while. Before setting up this server, an old buddy of mine had found me on Discord. We used to roleplay on Jcink forums, but I've stayed far away from those rps for a while because of the constant drama and faceclaims culture in those rps. We talked for a bit and decided that we wanted to roleplay together again. I've never been good at 1x1, so I made this original server and invited my buddy to come mod with me.\n\nOne day, this obnoxious girl joined the server. She got on our nerves from the beginning and my buddy who usually never trash talked, confined in me how he disliked this girl. I was still new to modding discord servers and decided to give her a chance instead of just kicking her. She actually turned out to be pretty okay, so much so, that I developed a crush on her. I eventually told her and our flirtatious cheasing each other turned into having feelings for one another.\n\nNever mix those kinds of feelings with roleplay, never.\n\nWe lived in two different countries, but we were both in Europe and besides, one of my best buddies has a serious partner in another country in Europe, so maybe that could work for me too? We talked on voice chat a lot and before I knew it, this girl wanted to come visit me in my country. I figured it would be cool because then I could meet her face to face and see if I felt anything for her in person.\n\nI just want to point out that we were not in a relationship at any point. We were simply having fun with flirtatious banter. I don't believe in relationships with someone you've never met in real life, at least not serious ones. What may work over text, doesn't always work in person and I've found this out the hard way before. In my opinions, having relationships online and calling each other \"my girl/boyfriend\" is extremely juvenile.\n\nBut the thing about this girl was that she was moving incredibly fast. This server hadn't even been alive for a month, and she were making plans to come visit me? Nope. My anxiety just went through the roof and I told her to stay away. I thought she understood. I'd been pretty up front about struggling with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to a point where I can't even go shopping because I physically can't breathe. It's sometimes I've struggled with all of my life and the fact that I was struggling with alcohol at the time as well did not help ease my anxiety.\n\nWelp.\n\nI found out later, that this girl did not understand at all. Behind my back, she had complained to my old buddy (there's a reason I mentioned him at the beginning and here it comes) and somehow he tried to defend me while also agreeing with her that I had overreacted about not wanting her to come visit me. So, I decided to talk to her, explained my situation and we tried to ease things up with some video games. I invited her to come play with my and my best friend, so we met up in this social/meeting hub in the game. I wanted to show my friend a secret in the hub and started doing all the steps for that secret to pop up, but this other girl kept getting in my way and on voice chat, she thought she was funny with her, \"what are you going to do, huh, you little bitch?\" but it actually pissed me off to such an extend that I had to log off and leave the voice chat without a word.\n\nFor a while, I didn't really speak to this girl or my buddy. That was until I found out that this girl had started dating my buddy and his girlfriend. I should probably mention here that I do believe in polyamorous relationships. My other real life friend that I mentioned earlier in a long distance relationship also has another serious partner in another country. That wasn't my issue with it. I was more pissed about the fact that my old buddy had kept going off about how he didn't like this girl and when I told him that I thought I was crushing on her, he was the one who told me to go for it. I don't care about bros before anything else, but it just felt wrong why he would suddenly be in a relationship with her when he disliked her and knew I'd had feelings for her. Turns out, it was his girlfriend who was good friends with this girl on my server who convinced him. He straight up told me that they'd talked about it and that she'd told him that she would never accept him being with another girl and that she wouldn't want to be with anyone else either. But suddenly it was okay when it was this girl who were their friend? I felt so annoyed with the hypocrisy and how my buddy couldn't see that she was manipulating him. I threw shit and the already shit covered fan that was whirling away like a jet engine in our conversation,",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, this is extremely long. \n\nI'm an absolute sucker for action/fantasy roleplays, specifically ones with lots of combat and adventuring. However, since I only do romance with partners I'm familiar with and I never do NSFW, my searches tend to yield little to no fruit. \n\nOne day, someone dm'ed me asking to roleplay, telling me they wanted to do a fighting roleplay. We'll call him Ethan (not his real name). This was the first time in MONTHS someone was willing to roleplay any sort of heavy action/fighting, with the exception of a few of my regular partners. I gladly accepted and we exchanged character info. \n\nIn short, my character is the grim reaper. I chose him because this new partner told me that his character is very powerful, which I normally don't have much of an issue with. As long as they're not completely indestructible, then it's fine by me. Basically, my character has perfected dark magic, can warp reality, and devours dead worlds to maintain immortality. However, I have VERY heavy restraints on the reality warping/world eating bit. He can't eat worlds that have life on them or else his parents, the guardians tasked with protecting the universe, will send him into eternal punishment. He doesn't warp reality unless the situation ABSOLUTELY calls for it (which I keep within my own stories, or use it with partners who are familiar with it and okay with it), because doing so basically unravels the fabric that is reality. That's a short summarization of what he can do, and there's more restraints to his abilities that are more based around his moral compass, but I never use reality-warping or world-eating unless I'm dealing with a godmodder. As well, I passively point out weaknesses without actually pointing out weaknesses. For example, I'd show how my character just charges into battle, regardless of his wounds or what the opponent is threatening to do. I leave it to my partner to pick up on it to prevent metagaming and to increase immersion, which works with many of my partners.\n\nThen Ethan sent his character. His character's bio was 1/10 actual biography/backstory and 9/10 powers and abilities. That should have been the first red flag. It took me a solid 10 minutes to read through all the abilities on his character's profile. I'm not even exaggerating. \n\nOf course, being desperate and kinda naive, I just wanted to get started. Ethan wrote the starter, I replied, and the fight began. \n\nHis writing style was fine. He was descriptive, included lots of imagery, so on and so forth. His grammar was a bit iffy, but it wasn't to a point where I couldn't read his responses. As the battle continued, he was wiping the floor with my character, so I decided to amp it up a bit. My character disregarded a bit of his moral compass under the thought that if he didn't slay his opponent, other people will suffer, which allowed him to use more of his abilities (minus the reality warping, but we'll get to that part later). When I thought it became fairly matched, Ethan decided \"lol nope.\" Even with everything my character was doing, he couldn't leave a scratch on him. Ethan's character was using nearly all of his 1048284 abilities without any restraint, limitations, or consequences. He did include measurements, times, and durations for each of his abilities, but they were all extremely overdone for one opponent. This included, but was not limited to: \n\n-Neverending nightmares that are impossible to escape from \n\n-Sending over 100 summoned full-sized dragons at my character\n\n-Putting my character in a daze without giving me a chance to dodge, or even find a way out of it to induce nightmares \n\n-Cast fear into the heart of my character, who is incapable of feeling fear \n\n-DISABLING THE ABILITIES OF MY CHARACTER WITHOUT GIVING ME A WAY TO DODGE, COUNTER, OR OTHERWISE AVOID IT \n\n-DESTROYING THE WEAPONS AND ARMOR OF MY CHARACTER WITHOUT GIVING ME A WAY TO DODGE, COUNTER, OTHERWISE OR AVOID IT, which left me with absolutely no way to fight back\n\nHe had stopped replying after that, and I shouldn't have messaged him again. When I did, he wanted to do a different roleplay, and I figured I might as well give him a second chance. Maybe he realized he was going way too far. This time, I picked my wizard character, who has a mastery over just about every magical element, but he doesn't go all-out because he's ashamed of his power. This character doesn't want to draw attention to himself because he fears absolute power, and he doesn't want his loved ones to be scared of him. He is also very weak physically, as he has the body of a 70 year old man.\n\nWe soon had to switch platforms because Ethan got banned from the community we were roleplaying in (HMMM I wonder why???) I should have just left, but again, I didn't take the chance when I saw it. I had an issue with everything he was doing, but I said nothing because it's been months since I've found a new partner to do a high fantasy/action roleplay with. \n\nEthan chose the same character, and it was the exact same thing. Sending my character into a slumber to suffer eternal nightmares, shutting off his abilities, so on and so forth while his character got ready to conquer his world (mind you, the \"preparations\" his character made for doing this lasted about 5 turns, and he didn't even say what he was doing to \"prepare\" for it). I had to bring in another character to try to deal with this. I mentioned this to another one of my roleplay partners, who has very powerful characters as well, and he loves tearing other overpowered characters apart. We'll call him Jim (not his real name). He wanted to join, so I asked Ethan if it was okay, and he was totally fine with it. We get Jim and my new character involved in the battle, but they're having the same issue. Jim's and my characters also have reality warping abilities, but they are scarcely used for reasons I've mentioned. \n\nWhen they start fighting, it's still the same thing. Ethan has ZERO limitations, restraints, or consequences for his character's abilities and he's using just about all of them with no issues. Our characters still can't lay a scratch on him, so we both amp it up to the point where our characters are bending reality to be able to use their abilities to their fullest potential. Still, we can't make a single dent because the only thing that can rival Ethan's character's power is another one of Ethan's characters, who is impossible to find. I'm not joking, he told us this. \n\nThen he puts the entire dimension they're fighting on into his own pocket dimension in an instant. He kidnaps one of my characters, but Jim has his character put Ethan's character into an infinite inescapable quantum time loop. We were both kinda fed up with what Ethan was doing at this point. Then Ethan essentially said \"no you didn't, that's not fair, that's godmodding. My character escapes the quantum time loop LOL\" \n\nThat's when the OOC chat starts. Jim points out how his character has been LITERALLY undefeatable and he's given us no chances to fight back fairly. Ethan argues, again, that his character's weakness is another one of his characters. There's a few issues with this. For one, he never mentioned or gave any hints as to how our characters could find his character. For two, if they gained that information from Ethan himself, that would be metagaming and we'd be just as bad as he is, if we decided to continue after that. For three, if we find his character to combat his other character, Jim's and my characters will turn into useless anime protagonists who sit on the sidelines and provide moral support as we watch Ethan roleplay with himself. That's literally how the \"my character fights my other character\" bit always goes. Out of my 6 years of roleplaying, I've never seen it go any other way. If anyone has, please do tell me, I'd love to hear it. I'm not even being sarcastic. \n\nI sided with Jim and told Ethan that he's had no restrictions or drawbacks on his character. At this point, Jim just let me talk because he knew he'd get very personal and rash very quickly. The only consequence I saw with his character was him being mildly exhausted after putting an entire world into a pocket dimension. Ethan argued that he did include drawbacks with his character's abilities and I just overlooked it. I read a bit more carefully on his responses, and surprise, I found no drawbacks or restraints. I pointed this out and Ethan said he included quantities and measurements in his abilities. I argued that he might think he did, but 100 dragons, 100+ full-sized meteors, a 100 billion square mile castle built in the span of a second, disabling the abilities of others without any way to get them back, putting a character into a coma and saying the only way to release them is if the caster wants to release them, and a 100,000 km pocket dimension around my character falls under no drawbacks/restraints, due to how extreme the numbers are. He basically conquered my character's realm and put everyone within it into a sleep coma in an instant, but said that it wasn't instant because his character made preparations (again, he never specified what those preparations were, which would have allowed for the other characters within the realm to catch onto it). \n\nEthan continued to tell me that he was descriptive and he told me exactly what each ability does, so therefore, it's not godmodding because he's not making it up on the spot. Again, I argued that the values were extreme and he gave us no weaknesses to exploit or find, simply because he had no drawbacks to his abilities. Not to mention how his character was completely impervious to any attack we threw at him. I told him I would no longer be roleplaying with him and thankfully, he stopped replying after that. I've never met a more awful godmodder in my life, and I should have just left when he sent his character info. Sorry this is so long, but this was just so bizarre and surreal. It upset me because I thought I found someone who wanted to do a fun high fantasy/action roleplay, but no, this guy just wanted to show me what his character can do.",
