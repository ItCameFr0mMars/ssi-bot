            "selftext": "One of the most uncomfortable moments for in this hobby for me is when I realize that certain people are lying to me. I don't mean stuff like saying that they will write today and not doing that or anything like that. But while ooc chatting with people, I sometimes realize that people are either trying to manipulate me, or that there are telling stories that can't be true.\n\nEspecially when searching for anime roleplays, I often encountered that, some examples:\n\n\\-lying about knowing a popular cosplayer. doing cosplay and regularly going to anime conventions, then after months have passed posting in the main chat that they will soon go to their first anime convention ever (this person even lied about being insulted on a convention, which clearly can't be true if she never went to one)\n\n\\-lying about their race (mentioning they are half japanese and stuff about their heritage) and then, after one year of chatting acting like they never said that and laughing it off\n\n\\-showing me photos of 'themselves' which are clearly taken from the internet\n\n\\-lying about being an artist and drawing, and then saying stuff like 'I can't show you anything, I recently burned all of my drawings' while harshly criticizing other artists (this person was never able to show a single drawing even after a year in the forum)\n\n\\-acting like they share my interests and then when I talk about them I realize that they obviously have never watched this movie/read this book and so on\n\n\\-inventing sisters/lovers and even interacting with selfmade fake accounts as if they were real\n\n\\-telling a lie and then getting mad at me when I innocently mention it later on (thinking it was true), acting like I am crazy for even saying something like that (this is the worst feeling ever)\n\nAnd much more. And the worst part for me is that all that stuff doesn't matter to me anyway. I don't value my roleplaying partners because they know famous people, are pretty, share every hobby/interest with me or are great artists. I like them because they are nice people and good writers, the roleplays with them are great and/or because they are funny and understanding. Doing stuff like that will make me question if they are dishonest with other stuff as well, and basically make me unable  to take anything they say seriously. \n\nit is really not worth it for me going 'Aw that sounds so cool!' once, I know that some people need attention, but  it will often come back to bite them in the long run and the consequences are not worth it. I saw people basically destroying all their chances of having online friendships like this. Even if people don't call them out on it, they often know and just don't want to deal with all the drama or make them feel ashamed.",

I'm talking about my own process when it comes to creating and writing out an original character.\n\nIt gets so bad that I can literally spend weeks if not months working on a single character and even then I am not even remotely satisfied with what I've come up with. It seems I never get done with a character. Backstory, appearance, personality, family relations, quirks, habits, random trivia... it's like I have to get it all on paper, yet very rarely anything ever comes of it. It's been so long since I've actually participated in a roleplay because of this. It is incredibly frustrating.\n\nTo demonstrate, I used to put out an ad for a roleplay, someone would respond, we try to set something up, okay, great, I'm still not done with my character but I REALLY want to roleplay so I give the go ahead, our characters have a brief back and forth before I decide that nope, my character is completely two-dimensional and I've messed up and I need to go back to the drawing board. I then feel like a total jerk for wasting this person's time so I end up ghosting them. It fucking sucks, I know. I'm not proud of it. This is also partially the reason I stopped roleplaying because I know it takes an absolute ass to randomly cut off a person who has invested time and effort in this collaborative project.\n\nThe main reason I'm posting htis is because I hope I can get some feedback, preferably from other folks who struggle with this sort of thing, so I can get back into roleplay. I really miss it. It's basically on my mind every day of the week.",

            "selftext": "I'm a member of a group of several sites run by the same group of people, and while it has its problems like any group, I'd never really had any issues with the staff, or any of the other members. Aside from the usual small stuff, people asking for threads and never responding, or taking forever, or unexpectedly leaving, etc.\n\nBut yesterday something happened that has made me want to drop almost all my characters, and more specifically, have nothing more to do with one of the staff.\n\nHe's always been really nice to me. He helped me get acclimated when I joined two of the sites, that are fandoms I'm not terribly familiar with. On one of the other sites, there's a huge plot arc coming up, and we came up with a really really neat ship/plot: Star-crossed lovers, doomed romance, eventual reunion, the works. I was super amazingly excited about it, and he said he was, too.\n\nYesterday, the plot arc finally started. We were so close to doing our ship! And then, he DMs me to say, \"Don't hate me, but someone approached me with a different plot idea, and I want to do that instead.\"\n\nI'm the first to admit I'm an emotional person. But I don't cry easily. Y'all, I burst into tears. Told him it was alright, even though it definitely wasn't, because I'm not going to try to force him to do the ship if there's another plot he wants to do more. But I was utterly wrecked. I feel like I not only got lied to, if he could say he was *that* excited and then just flip a switch and go to a different plot, not to mention, he just totally ditched me. That shit hurts.\n\nSo now I'm stuck in a situation where I don't want to write with this guy, because I absolutely hate being lied to and/or ditched, but where I also don't want to play a character that I love, because this guy put a bad taste in my mouth about them. But if I stop writing with him, I become the bad guy, because the staff is super enmeshed and codependent.\n\nFuck me, right?",

There are usually minors in my fandom\u2019s rp groups, so I understand sensitivity, but some of them are just over the damn top.\n\n- In one group, I was seriously scolded for using the word \u2018abuse.\u2019 The word. \n\n- In another, were talking about weird foods that we enjoy and I mentioned that I like popsicles with crunchy ants in them. Someone asked what those were so I showed a picture, and an admin lost her shit because someone expressed that they were scared of bugs. I\u2019ll censor it, don\u2019t go on a whole tangeant and talk to me like I\u2019m a child.\n\n- In one I just left, an entity in the lore said \u2018I\u2019ll show you something worth watching.\u2019 Someone made a joke that the entity should keep their clothes on and I chimed in \u2018oo strip tease.\u2019 Admins did not like that. Keep in mind that this was a group that featured psychological horror and gore. \n\n- In general I also hate when people are having a discussion about something like an illness or a wound and the admins bend to the one person who gets grossed out.",

I do not have problems setting up scenes or ending a scene but during the dialogue I feel that I really have difficulties writing longer posts (1-2 paragraphs instead of usually 3-4).\n\nDo you have any advice on how I can work on that?\n\nThanks in advance\nGreetings",

            "selftext": "This was quite a while ago, back when I first started RPing, but this is still one of the craziest RP experience I\u2019ve ever had\n\n\nAt first, the user started out friendly, I\u2019ll call her \u2018Stella\u2019\nShe wanted to do an Undertale RP and I thought \u2018why not, I like the games\u2019\n\nUpon starting, her character immediately goes haywire and starts a fight with my character, and by god her character is literally God but somehow more overpowered\n\n\nShe dodged every attack, could teleport, could create some sticky gooey matter that kills people instantly, can fly, is immortal, can regenerate, could shoot blasts that could destroy a whole region and more\n\nAnd that was only her FIRST FORM!!! SHE STILL HAD A \u201cBerserk\u201d MODE!!!\n\nApparently her character\u2019s weakness was that she has a berserk mode where she loses control and rain havoc\u2026.how is that a weakness? Throwing a tantrum and annihilating everyone isn\u2019t a weakness in any way.\n\nAnd if I do a single thing she didn\u2019t like, such as having my character flee from the fight (a logical thing to do since he\u2019s literally fighting a goddamn deity) she gets mad and starts cursing me out, calling me the R word and more\n\nIf I tell her to chill, she says \u201cI have anger problems, don\u2019t make me mad\u201d\nOkay? I also have anger issues, I had to see a therapist back in elementary school because my self-control was nonexistent but you don\u2019t see me throwing a fit because my partner wasn\u2019t doing  exactly what I want them to do\n\n\nFew weeks later, she invites me to a group RP, and once again is OP, she uses terms like *No dodge, no block* in her attacks and controls other people\u2019s characters (at one point she wrote that my character screamed in pain after an attack from her, not giving me a chance to dodge to do anything about it) \n\nAt one point my character is sealing up behind her, I wrote \u201c*My character* held a dagger and sneaked up behind Stella\u201d (again, this I back when I just started out)\n\nHer character somehow detected my character and turned around to spot me \n\nI told her that my character was sneaking, and she once again threw a tantrum \nCalled me the R word, said racial slurs (some of which don\u2019t even apply to me) and more\n\nShe then had the audacity to try and justify her actions in and out of the RP\nI contacted the mod and she ended up kicking me \n\nShe got banned I think\n\nShe was just a selfish and rude person I general, in the middle of our RP she would randomly say \u201cI\u2019m bored, I\u2019m gonna play Minecraft\u201d leaving me and several others characters frozen because we were interacting with her",

            "selftext": "First of all sorry for spelling or grammar mistakes, I usually never write posts on reddit but I couldn't sleep and found this sub. TLDR in the title.\n\nSo I met this player over a year ago in a public mmo RP location. Our characters disliked each other but we got to talk OOC &amp; decided to play together with on of her other characters.  \nWe build this relationship of our characters together &amp; had many great plays. With the time we talked more OOC about our other interests, we found many things we had in common.\n\nDuring the pandemic &amp; the lockdowns we started chatting on a daily basis. She became someone I considered very close over time. We were both very clear on what happens in RP is IC &amp; OOC stays OOC. Then one of my other friends dropped the bomb one day &amp; asked if I do crush on her. It was a bit embarassing at first but I admitted fast that I took a real liking on her apart from our RP.\n\nOther players would joke on how much she tells them how amazing I would be &amp; how fun our plays are. Sometimes she would compliment me &amp; tell me how much she would like to get to know me better. Problem was: I am (gender-)queer. And my character is a handsome male elf. So I started to talk &amp; revealed that I am indeed not a handsome male elf irl but like him, attracted to all kind of people. I got my hopes up just to be crushed quickly as she explained it's cool since she thinks of herself as bisexual too but mentioned she is way older than I am.   \nThe difference is almost 20yrs between us (I'm in my early 20ies), she was married before, lives in a still very homophobic country, was never with a woman  etc. etc. and I crossed it out of my mind to go further with those feelings since I saw many problems coming up. \n\nWe went on being close for another few months until my anxieties got worse from the pandemic &amp; the troubles it brings to my private life. We still played our characters as it became my safe haven to have the RP &amp; our talks. Soon I started to feel like she got mad at our RP. Some of our characters broke off their romantic adventures &amp; I feared it bothered her OOC. When I asked about it, we had a long &amp; deep talk about how she just felt bad for her character but it wouldn't change anything with us irl. Yet I kept worring as she started to distance herself which ended with me having a breakdown &amp; asking if I did something wrong. In the heat of the moment she confessed to me &amp; said that she has romantic feelings for me but wouldn't want anything to change if I felt weirded out by it.\n\nI told her I did return her feelings but that it wouldn't work out with a lot of reasons, apart from the age gap &amp; personal stuff, my mental health suffered a lot through the pandemic &amp; I don't feel ready to start a new relationship (being a long distance one on top of that).  \nFrom there on things became slowly worse. RP felt uncomfortable as we played another couple &amp; she started to make jokes on \"how our characters could be together ~~at least~~\" which stung a lot. My mental health got worse &amp; while being understanding at first, she sounded very upset when I cancelled RP at bad days. I got us into a lot of discussions to settle things clearly.\n\nAfter many long talks &amp; some arguments we decided to take some distance from each other.   \nI didn't feel such a huge heartbreak in a long time. I lost a great friend &amp; RP partner even though we had the same feelings &amp; thought we could work around it. At the same time my character who had all those relationships with her's can't move on as well. I'm frustrated because I lost all motivation &amp; fun to build up new RP relationships plus I still mourn after what we build up together.",

Very annoying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's like we're going to exchange characters and they're like;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThem - \"My OC sheets usually get pretty big, but it's okay if yours doesn't match mine.\"  \n\n\nMe - \"Ok...\" (trying really hard not to get aggravated and pull out one of my 30+ page long OC's at her.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the RP started they did like a 1,500+ word count, but their next reply was only about 650 words. So I asked which length they usually went for. It was a simple question to me. I expected a simple answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of just saying that one or the other was their usual length they basically danced around the question and then said; \"Do you want shorter replies? =P\"  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcuse me? I mean seriously. The little tongue out emoji at the end? How in the world am I going to interpret that as anything other than it sounding like; \"Lol sounds like you can't keep up with my writing!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt what point (never) did I even imply that their word count was too intimidating for me? (Never)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would prefer the 650 word count because I can reply to that a lot faster and actually get the RP moving, but because of that little teasing line now I have to outdo them. Now I'm like; \"Oh gee guess I have to make a 5,000 word reply next time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust very annoyed. Thank you for letting me rant.",

            "selftext": "I had this really bad experience a while ago, and it was all because of my own negligence and selfishness.\n\nI was part of a RWBY forum on FF (which also used a Discord server to communicate) that had topics at all four major huntsman academies and used the team mechanic and was populated entirely by OCs. After the owners decided they didn't want to do it anymore, I took over and started a new forum with the same basic concept.\n\nThe forum grew over the next several months, and all seemed well until one of the members had to leave. Due to the team structure and the fact that this member had multiple students and other characters spread across the different topics, this ground the forum to a halt. Thankfully, the RP had only just begun and it was easy to restart everything without the team structure.\n\nSadly, however, about half of our members left. I consider the people I RP with to be my friends, and losing friends is the worst feeling ever. Especially when it's your own fault. The most heartbreaking loss of all was this one player whom I had invited over who also ran her own original fantasy forum. She agreed to come over, but I still think it was selfish of me to invite her over. She was a creative genius, and I honestly had a bit of a crush on her even though I knew a relationship between us would never work out. \n\nThe RP has recovered since then and is still running, and we have a lot of new members. The people left over a year ago, but for some reason I tend to stay upset about these sorts of things for far longer than a normal or sane person would. Many of those who left said they did because of real life stuff, but I can't help but wonder if they'd still be with us if I'd realized the problems with RWBY's team mechanic sooner.\n\n**Morals of the story:** Don't use RWBY's team structure for RPs. It's good for the show, but HORRIBLE for RPing. Also, if you have a genius friend running her own fantasy forum, DO NOT invite her over to yours. It's selfish, and it will take her attention away from her own forum. And you will be responsible for ruining an original fantasy masterpiece forever.",

I send along my OC in a GoogleDoc, and read over the GoogleDoc myself to refamiliarize myself with my character.\n\nIf you aren't aware, GoogleDocs have the uncanny ability to show when someone else has accessed your document. No one ever showed up to read it, but the person emailed me back saying she was \"cute.\" That's it. I have had people do this in the past, so already I'm on edge. Meanwhile, she sends along her OC which sounds... honestly, very self-insert/idealistic. American name in a Japanese setting, a desirable character that got all the money from her lover instead of his wife. \n\nReally nervous, I give her an out. I say my OC is really new (it's true), so if she could tell me something she liked specifically, I'd be grateful for feedback. Her response? \n\n\"I like that her birthday is a day before mine! Also, my character and her could hang out a lot being in a similar place most of the time.\" \n\nThat's it. That's all I got. She then proceeds to give a large paragraph of her plot ideas for herself including a few YouTube clips from television shows to get the imagery across. \n\nAm I crazy to think this won't end well, or do you think she is just excited and doesn't realize what she is doing?",

It gave very little information, so I needed to make sure it fit our criteria.   \n\n\nWhat I found was this guy who had taken actual pictures of his actual sister and posted them all over the server.   \n\n\nIdk if I should report this or how I can? It's just really sketched me out. It's not even the concept of the server so much as the fact that he's seemingly taken pictures of his sister without her consent and is posting them on a server meant to talk about gang-r\\*ping someone he knows IRL. The kinks he listed for what he wants in the server were some pretty brutal things.   \n\n\nOof. I noped out within a minute after seeing enough. Holy hell.",

I met this other woman who lived in the same country as me (which is super rare when I find rp partners). She was such an amazing writer and even though I consider my writing nothing special, we clicked and came up with amazing ideas etc. The problem was covid hit and I started working from home, and I wasn't replying consistently. I admit I was really bad sometimes, not replying for 2-3 weeks, but I messaged her ooc almost every day just to check in. I thought we were friends after a few months. We discussed our work and hobbies outside of rp etc, she was so patient with me. I would apologize and ask how her day's going and she would always tell me it's fine so I didn't stress. Until one day she was like \"Hey, this is actually really annoying\" to put it simply. I found out that all the times she told me that it's fine and not to worry wasn't actually true, that it really bugged her a lot and I don't understand why she wasn't upfront with me about it sooner. Not only that, but she sprung this on me the weekend my cousin died. She deleted me like I was nobody to her after almost a year. I think the worst part is I thought we were friends, but she told me I was too attached :/ it hurt a lot more than I care to admit. I legit cried lol.

The first two oldest have been months long, since last year actually, one about vampires and the other about 1920s gangsters. Some of the more recent have been a medieval fantasy, a modern day slice of life with a succubus, a magical college, and a late 1920s road trip sort of thing. All of these are enjoyable and fun in their own ways.  Each of my partners for these RPs are brilliant writers and genuinely fun human beings. But what's the one thing that happens with every RP? NONE of them have consistently gone on for every hour we're awake, for every day, of every week, of every month since the RPs began. EVERY single one has been paused for a time. A day, a week, he'll sometimes a few weeks. Why?\n\nLIFE.\n\nPeople CANNOT keep up RPs all the time and they will AND SHOULD take breaks. One reason being that an rp is a story not a romantic, committed relationship (a whole can of worms im not tapping on here), it can certainly become that but none of my RP partners have ever gone near that and that's honestly fine. My RP partners like and understand each other's writing styles, interests interests even sexual desires. But most of us are only friends in an RP sense and barely anything else. So people, please, don't force your self to keep RPs going all the time. Don't expect them to go all the time. An rp can survive weeks of postponing and it's healthy. \n\nJust be kind to yourself and kind to others. Please?",

I have been on the pursuit of finding a longterm roleplayer that will actually want to be friends first and not just talk to me just for rp purposes. I will admit, I\u2019m extremely jealous of my friend. My friend writes on AO3 and her RP Partner messaged her from her contacts and they\u2019ve been at it for two years now. They are talking all the time, communicating and sharing memes and videos together. They rp a lot and they just, they work so well. I just want to have someone to talk to about my fixations and rp wants and needs and them understand what I\u2019m talking about at least a little bit. \n\nI admit that finding rp partners is hard but I\u2019m not going to give up but I\u2019d love some advice!

            "selftext": "Been chilling here the last few days. Figured I might as well share the incident that led me to find this sub. It's a bit long so I'll put a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nA guy messaged me for fandom RolePlaying. He hadn't seen the whole show but he was fine with rewatching some of it so I said cool. \n\nHe didn't want to RP the show's canon but make an AU, something I wasn't too into but I said okay. He started to gear the RP towards ERP and there were some ideas I liked but overall ERP doesn't interest me too much or at least, interest me in the same way it did him. \n\n\\[Not very sex driven, you could say. I like my stories\\]\n\nI didn't super care about any of this, it was just something to reply to in between my chores. However it quickly became clear he was very needy. \n\nI don't mind OOC chatter, I'm usually very chatty. But he would **pry** for fucking information about my personal life. An obnoxious amount. He wasn't satisfied with our RP because you know, it takes awhile to reply, so he wanted to try sexting. I told him no. \n\nHe wanted me to voice chat with him, I told him no. It UPSET him and he whined about how lonely he was. His partners would ditch him. I would post a RP ad elsewhere on Reddit and he would get jealous and freak out. It was fucking bizarre. \n\nWe got into a disagreement after he blew up after I shared a picture he didn't like, he demanded I delete it after he offered to RP the scenario the picture was implying \\[it was something lewd\\] and I said I don't much care for it and he just turned aggressive about the situation like that. I stepped away to watch something with my family and he was upset I wouldn't reply to him, so he left the server. \n\nFor some reason I felt bad, I remembered he told me he had been ghosted and I felt like an ass because normally I don't just leave like that \\[i usually don't announce i'm leaving but I can get how he'd think I was blocking him or something\\] so I reached out to him, apologized \\[not for the picture tho\\] and we resumed RPing. It didn't last long. \n\nHe was even more obnoxious, digging for information, giving me unsolicited advice. One of our conversations went, from me saying I have a sewing project to him suggesting I go...intern at a seamstress position downtown? \n\nI never asked for job advice? I don't need it? I don't need someone telling me how to spend my day? I told him I was busy and he would go, \"with what? you don't do anything\" \n\nYeah yikes. I stopped OOC talking to him after that and he could tell the information wasn't going to be freely flowing. He tried once more to do a voice call but I vetoed that and told him I probably wouldn't even consider it for a long time. \n\nHe said he just had no filter after being alone for so long and I told him to think as me as very reserved. \n\nOther nonsense of his includes **stalking my reddit.** He admitted to studying my posts daily to see what I've been saying &amp; doing. I told him you know, that's pretty creepy and people don't like that. He just shrugs it off. This is important later.\n\nSo comes Friday night, I have plans. Friends are over, we're watching a show, it was fun. I'm replying to my RPs about once every \\~2ish hours, mind you I have other RPs that are also long form. This set him off. He went off.   \n\"I was really looking forward to RolePlaying\" ect ect. Just guilt tripping me, mind you I'm still replying? I'm just busy.   \n\n\nHe then said you' know this smut thing isn't working out, let's redo the RP but focus on the plot' mind you he was the one pushing for ERP.   \n10 minutes roll by, i'm still afk, he just says never mind, don't message me again, leaves the server.   \nI'm done with this, so I block him, delete the server, and i go about my day. \n\nI have a new reddit by this point and I search for new partners, and he messages me this creepy af \"found your alt. That's all \". So I blocked him on reddit as well. \n\nTLDR: Man sought me for RP, wanted to sext / had no personal boundaries or sense of reservation. Got angry and threw a fit when I was busy and couldn't reply faster and is stalking my reddit. \n\n&amp; Yes i'm sure he knows about this account and will read this at some point.",

            "selftext": "Below is an example of a typical pm that i will type to a roleplayer that has posted an ad that I'm interested in. Usually, it looks something like this. I'm so worried because I want to roleplay with more people, but few ever really respond when I send something like this. Is it my response that's bad? Is there something on my profile that looks bad? I just want to improve whatever I can, so I can roleplay with more people. Here is the example below:\n\n\nGood Afternoon! I saw your roleplay post on the subreddit, and I am definetly interested! My name is Shetland(EuphoricGloom on Reddit), and I am 21 years old. I have been roleplaying for 5-6 years, and have a decent experience in about every genre: from cyberpunk to sci-fi, medieval to colonial, generic fiction based roleplays to nonfiction ones, post-apocalyptic to dystopian, etc etc. I've accumulated a lot of OC's over time, most human but some other alien-like species/mythical species. I do a lot of world building as i typically write short stories and poems. I took an AP English class while in highschool, and got a B+. I would also like to note that I have roleplayer with 70+ roleplayers, who are all diverse and unique in their own way, so my writing style is easily adaptable. \n\nI will include a roleplay example below, but even before we begin plotting and discussing things, I would really like to get to know you and your style a little bit more, just to see your post's style and get a feel for what you enjoy in a roleplay. I would also like to mention that I will accommodate for your time zone, and that I currently am on EST time. Generally, I will be active long after midnight or early in the morning. If you have a stressful work life or life in general, I would also like to mention I will gladly talk with you about things if you are stressed in a VentChat(if we do a server) or in ooc. \n\nIncluded below is an example of a starter from a roleplay I had with a friend a while back. Here it is:\n\n~It didn't take a blind man recovering his sight to see the city was in shambles. The dust in his shoes would be enough proof for him in the moment. The Carcass was extra cloudy today, the shady crimson clouds cramming their way through the sky in a march towards the horizon. Warped steel towers hung their heads above sandy, desolate metal streets , as if trying to stare at their reflection through the grainy flood. Walls of mechanical refuse and ruins lay around in the street, like animals trying to keep cool in the sun. Only a few orange skinned humans dared to saunter down the street, some in a drunken or drugged state, and others simply battling the wind that vivaciously roared it's battlecry.~\n\n~A little pause here in the story just to say that if you read this, please post somewhere in your reply 'Turtles'. I do this because some people simply skim over these types of replays. Thank and here's the rest of the pos\u2193t~\n\nThe Carcass was an experience. One doesn't just walk through the downed steampunk city. One would be absorbed by its surroundings, and like the area, it would change them. Homes adapted from the twisted metal into slums, shambles of their previous glory, of which was now erased by the egregious environment. Originally, it had been full of the greens of wall gardens: the blues of pearlescent cerulean marble towers, and the glitzy yellow glow of casinos, skyscrapers, now stripped down to the bare orange-ish metals that once his behind it's glamor. Much like it's once thriving cityscape, the citizens mirrored the devastation of the environment. Their clothes in tatters, their stature shaky or bulky: they too looked just as rifted by their world. The streets today weren't very lively: on the sidewalk appeared a withered old man with a gasmask, and overalls skulking past a woman with jury-rigged electronic ARKOS Technologies Mech Suit that half dragged on the choppy pedway was all that really was nearby. This was not counting the squatters in the abodes nearby, who watched the skies for any blessing of a scrap shard or computer chip to salvage~\n\nThank you for reading, and I'm excited to hear back from you!",

            "selftext": "TLDR: Player joins my RP, never communicated with me. Calls me a megalomaniac, deletes a discord channel before leaving.\n\nDoing this via mobile so sorry if there are any mistakes lol.\n\nThis happened about three months ago or so, I currently run an RP based off of a book series called Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard trilogy. The RP group was small to begin with. We had 5 players at the start, two of them had to drop it due to life issues. Though it may sound like I am for the post but I\u2019m not really.\n\nSo I decide to just open it up for newer players, this player decides to express interest, I\u2019ll call him the Man Child. First red flag was he submitted his CS unfinished pretty much, told him to finish it and let me know when it was done. I have a small part in the rules for my RPs rules that I have used for the last three years now usually it\u2019s something that pertains to the RP it is to make sure that players have read the rules. \n\nI also have a 7 day posting rule, if you don\u2019t post in that time you get the boot also players have to wait before I have to post again and write what\u2019s going on around the players. Normally there isn\u2019t an issue, as long as people tell me what\u2019s up I\u2019ll always work with them. I always keep communications open for everyone and reach out to my players.\n\nHe submits it again without that bit third time he finally does and it looks good to go. He\u2019s then finally invited into the discord for the forum RP I host with two other RPs I run. Discord is where I have all my communications with other players from the other RPs one channel for each RP. He barely ever came into the discord at all. \n\nNext thing he asks if he can his character have a history with one of mine, I said sure that\u2019s fine. My one character is a Viking, and apparently during one of the raids she was in, killed his character\u2019s family. When he finally gets his post in though the group is in a really cold place and have him start out washed on shore not to far from the group. This is where all the problems started.\n\nMan Child then has his character go in the opposite direction towards the ocean where a giant sea monster was that caused the group to wash up on the shore. So I tagged him both in the OOC for the RP and discord channel to that he might want to rethink that since his character might die due to the cold. No response from either places I end up going to bed for the night. I wake up and get ready for work, and get a rude message in the OOC from him and just kills off his own character.\n\nWhen I check discord for messages I find out that he\u2019s gone along with the RPs channel in my discord server. And no one on the server but me has the permissions to add or delete channels. So I go off on him since he rarely ever tried to communicate either.",

            "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nWhen I was young (younger than 14) and somewhat new yet familiar to Discord, I joined a Hetalia server. No one really knew my age or such. I wasn't going to keep that out in the open. \n\nThere was this guy, I'll name him Matt. He was 17 at the time, I believe, and was part of the server. \n\nThere was a channel dedicated to 1x1 roleplay ads regarding Hetalia. I posted an ad in which I'd roleplay as a certain region in my country, as a human and she wanted to search for new job opportunities in a new country. It was supposed to be a wholesome romance story. \n\nMatt decides to go message me and says that he was interested in roleplaying with me. I decided to say sure. He wanted to integrate elements of his own previous ad, and I didn't see a problem. Thing is, I didn't read his previous ad. \n\nWe roleplay, our characters meet, and we come up to a point in which their relationship gets a bit more romantic. My character gave his a kiss on a cheek, and left to her room. Guess what happens next? His character gets a hard on. \n\nNow, for some reason, I didn't see a single problem with this. My friend and I, for some reason, did some crack ERPs included with our Hetalia rp, so that probably was the reason. \n\nMoving on, they go out on a date together. They go to a hotel, and do the dirty.... I didn't think of anything when it was implicated that Matt's character was stripping to take a shower, and he wanted to shower with my own. I didn't know why I didn't stop him. I didn't know why I told him that I was getting uncomfortable. \n\nEventually, it ended up with my character taking the lead. I was an inexperienced teen, so I just went with what I knew from reading fanfiction. At some point I did go back to read what Matt's ad was..... it happened to include femdom. At this point, I probably should've stopped him but I just kept on going. We did another ERP, but I blocked him at the 3rd time he wanted to do it. \n\nI don't know why I did that with someone who was nearly an adult. I don't know why I did something clearly stupid and potentially damaging to both sides. I wish I had stopped the roleplay as soon as possible. I wish I had stopped Matt before it got too deep. \n\nI never allow ERP into my roleplays ever again. I've understood the consequences of my actions, and I wish that something like that never happened. It's one of my biggest regrets till this day, and I hope it never happens again in the foreseeable future.",

            "selftext": "I'm 30F and have been RPing for like 20 years it seems, way back when certain sites and instant messaging took dominance. So, I thought I had encountered it all haha. But I just had someone approach me and wouldn't progress until I agreed to doing voice chat in the future. Is this normal for folks? I have never had someone ask this of me and I don't know it's due to me being a little old and not keeping up with any new trends in the RPing community. Or if this was as weird as I thought. I was getting some 'creepy' vibes and need to know if it's just me and VC is becoming a prominent 'thing' or what. It felt like the RP was secondary to why they even reached out, they sounded a little more interested in talking than writing together. The vibe was really weird...\n\n**The following happened on discord:**\n\nThem: Hello there, still looking for a longterm RP partner? I saw your advert in the server, and would like to discuss details if you're interested.\n\nMe: Hiya. Sure we can chat a bit. What from my ad interested you? Was there a particular fandom?\n\nThem: I guess the Hunger Games seemed fun, but honestly I'm open to most settings. Would you be open to talk details in voice chat? It's just I prefer to know my partners a bit more if this is going to be long term. I know most people are scared to talk, however.\n\nMe: I would prefer we talk more. I know what you mean about it being easier to brainstorm verbally but I don't usually do that until I know partners better.\n\nThem: Alright, but it is something you are open to in time, yes?\n\nMe: Sure, provided we click and get some rapport developing.\n\nThem: Yeah that's fine, but I will say ahead of time VC is eventually a requirement for me. :slight_smile:\nI just want to make sure we are on the same page about that ahead of time before we continue further :)\n\nMe: Sure, I understand. Like I said, I'm comfortable provided we get to know one another. I can't really promise the future. if that's too tentative for you, I get it.\n\nThem: Yeah sorry, I would need a promise. If you can't make that it's understandable.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I just want to know if happens to just me and in the group of friends that I am but, ugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, there's this girl who has always been annoying af \\[though initially I wouldn't see it\\], and I don't mean like oh she demands so much attention, she's annoying - no. I mean, she goes up to the lengths of making a WHOLE drama because me and another roleplayer don't reply to her as much as we reply to each other but I mean, honestly when we have more muse for a certain character and plot, can't be helped. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, she messages me privately and makes an entire drama about how we ignore her, and we love our ships more, and begin even to message me aggressive messages that are bordering to bitchy and I try to explain her that is not her rp, is because the character's muse. You know? Well, here comes the real thing; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, she always had this complex with her writing style. Let's just say that me and my other partner are novella type of length and she always was um, well, 5 - 10 lines and not really add much details, while I write with A LOT of details because otherwise I feel like MY reply lacks of something. Point is, from a little while I've begun to notice that there has been changes in her rp. Like DRASTIC changes, she begun to try using my writing style. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone has a certain writing style, right? And it's okay, as you roleplay with someone, some traits are shared and can be even similar. I'm not fighting, that actually happens to me a lot. What I'm saying is that she begins to use A LOT of the terms that I use, a lot of writing style traits that I use and no one else in the group uses, and she doesn't even use them right. That's what I'm saying. And funny thing is, she doesn't even use that style with me, she just uses that style with the roleplayer that she wants the attention from, who is our other friend. With me she keeps writing in her usual style, all changes when she replies to our other roleplay partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe really is two faced because with everyone else, she is super sweet and lovely but with ME, oh boy, at times I feel like her stress ball because she comes and basically gets all sour because our other friend just replies to me, and hypes only about our ships, and etc. I keep telling her a million excuses as why can that be, and then when she calms down and stop being bitchy, she uses the depression to justify herself. One time? Alright, I get it. We can get jumpy and irritated with depression. But this is like a habit now. And I know a lot of you can advise that I should tell the admin but thing is, she KNOWS how to play her cards right. She knows how to victimize herself. And I really don't want her as enemy, so I keep all this emotions to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOH, if that was not enough - she COPIES my characters. Literally. I have this character who is fan of things that no one in the group is, his personality traits were carefully chosen as well as the way I portray him, and what happened? She recently made a character with the very same liking, aesthetic, and PERSONALITY as my character. I know that there can be many characters with similar personality traits but I swear, the way I describe him in my replies is the same way she's describing her character in her replies. Lol, not even change the words I use. At this point, I want to know if this is a common thing to happen among roleplayers or if I just had back luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts or stories that you'd like to share with me over annoying roleplayer?",
