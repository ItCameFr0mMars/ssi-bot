            "selftext": "So this has been something that\u2019s bothered me about the rp community is how people describe their literacy. I know that there isn\u2019t a set chart to follow, which could be part of the problem and also there are rpers who vary on post length where they can push out a paragraph or do novella. I try to stay pretty accurate about how much I\u2019ll write and I\u2019ll offer writing samples to people I contact or if it\u2019s in one of my ads I\u2019ll mention the literacy I have and will expect from my partner yet I can\u2019t count the number of times somebody starts off one literacy and completely changes (usually writing less). My most recent case of this was beginning a marvel rp where the person advertised they could write three paragraphs and the only time it was truly three or more paragraphs was their starter, other than that it was basically two sentences per paragraph. It sucks cause for me it subverts my expectations where they advertise one length and provide another. Ive tried asking for writing samples but those haven\u2019t always been reflective of their style too since they can cherry pick whichever post they feel like or write however much they want for one post to match what they think I\u2019m looking for and then once I bite and the rp begins their length will change",

            "selftext": "So here is the story, I was in this multi fandom discord roleplay server. Everything was hunky dory. One of my best friends from my Tumblr rp days was a mod. I was making friends and having a great time. And then this new person joined (she was a return member through her first stint in the server had been only a little over a month). She seemed alright. A week into her being there she was suddenly made a mod. This seemed suspicious to me and a friend I\u2019d made in server but we left it be. A few short weeks later this new person joins (turns out he knew the new mod). He caused some problems, made some inappropriate comments to one member, made assumptions about other people\u2019s muses in character, wrote a character\u2019s accent in a horrible offensive manner, and was dismissive of most other male muns in the server. Each time he was talked to and mostly corrected his behaviour.\n\nThe real issue was this mod. She constantly showed him favouritism, would neglect all other partners for him and was constantly jumping to his defence. She wasn\u2019t just gushing over the plots they had in the server but outside in a 1x1 setting as well. When called out for this behaviour she then proceeded to deny she\u2019d done anything wrong and used manipulative language to make the person with the issue feel bad for bringing it up. Over all she was a lying manipulative person. \n\nThings continued to get worse over time though she stopped neglecting others as much. I decided that when going to the mods and some of my friends from the server as they had somehow gotten closer with her and him. I went to a friend who was no longer in the server (they\u2019d been kicked) after venting to them they went to the server feedback and began to spam it in retaliation. Somehow because I\u2019d asked a few people if they\u2019d had issues this whole mess fell on me. I was kicked from the server. \n\nI have since made my own server and funny thing is they\u2019ve found it and have been making accusations that I\u2019m copying their basic design. It makes me laugh because the lore is completely different. The only similarities is some of the server layout and some similar (and basic) rp rules.",

I just feel bad because it's not like they're sending me one liners as a sample. I can see that they're putting in the effort to write... it's just not \"good enough\" for me.

            "selftext": "So, this all happened on an alt account, on the day I had to pack and move out of my college dorm. I had posted an ad for a specific nsfw rp. Found a few decent partners. One guy messaged me and we started talking about stuff, and I told him that I would be inactive for a bit, as my family was coming to help me move out. Usually that kind of thing has never been an issue, but this guy said something along the lines of \"you should be consistent in rp\". Basically saying I needed to be available all the time. I explained that I do usually respond quickly, but my real life stuff has to come first. We got it sorted out, then moved to discord to rp. My goodness, aside from the rude behavior, this guy wasn't a great partner, at least for me. He sent 5 separate, one-line messages at a time as his contribution, and would control my character. I told him off for controlling my character, and we continued. Then I had to go, and told him. I came back a few hours later to see that he continued messaging me about how I need to be available. I responded and sent my response for the rp, and over a month later haven't heard any reply. Good riddance",

Also one month the character has a certain kind of personality/aesthetic/wants and etc. Then the next month I feel like you are being introduced to a new character?\n\nI have always been a bit lost and confused when this happens. I want to be respectful but I feel like I wonder if it is normal to feel stressed about this? Mainly because some of these changes effect me and my characters within the roleplay.

Let\u2019s call them \u201cpervert\u201d (you\u2019ll see why later). When they first dmed me they wanted to do a highschool role play with oc 1. I quickly ended the rp due to the fact it was ONLY nsfw and no moving at all. However I got another dm with the same username but different numbers asking to rp with my teacher oc. I came to realize it was pervert when all they did was screw my oc and had the same style, exactly the same. I ended the rp and moved on. Soon I got a dm asking to rp with the same teacher. It started off decent but then it went start to smut, nothing else. The worse thing is my oc kept telling his one oc no but he kept pushing the smut on her until she pushed said oc off, to which afterwards the main oc started fucking her. \n\nI have way more stories I can tell, I\u2019ll make sure to post them",

            "selftext": "Okay, so back when I was on discord (I am now IP-banned because of my sister) I was in an rp about things called \u201csweetlings\u201d Sweetlings were girls based on sweets. They lived in a dystopian society. My character was Blondie Mocha, a rebel swordswoman. Then, a sweet 13 year old joined our server. We\u2019ll call her Makichan. Her character seemed promising. Her name was Rainbow Milkshake. Rainbow Milkshake was a crybaby with a big heart. Rainbow never gave up no matter what. She had a naginata. She fell in love with Blue Heaven Ice Cream. Blue Heaven was a shy and kind girl owned by one of the admins. Then we started going on adventures, Rainbow Milkshake was utterly USELESS! She was always getting defeated by villain characters. She would always beg Blondie Mocha to protect her. And then her other OC, Funfetti Cookie, showed up. Funfetti Cookie was an insane evil assassin with psychic powers. She was also in love with Blondie Mocha. She kept attacking the group and flirting with Blondie, using psychic powers to make Blondie join her, constantly bragging that Blondie loved her...Then she got captured by the trio..and ended up becoming good. The owner and main villain Crystal Sugar HATED this, both in character and out. The owner kept complaining about Funfetti. Crystal Sugar was an evil psychic with two sisters, Lemon Chiffon, Blueberry Cake, and Pink Velvet. Then, the quartet STORMED THE CASTLE OF CRYSTAL SUGAR in order to free Cotton Candy and Vanilla Cherry Mochi, Makichan\u2019s other characters, who were kidnapped and scheduled for execution! And Funfetti and Rainbow (who was usually COMPLETELY USELESS) So this was an RTK (reason to kill) server, meaning that if it\u2019s a dangerous situation, for example, squaring off against an evil overlord. So, Blue Heaven, an admin, after a huge fight in the rp discussion channel with Makichan and the owner, decided this quartet were \u201cmain characters\u201d and main characters could not die. So Rainbow and the others saved Candy and Cherry..and the owner was PISSED. After Makichan pulled more OP Mary Sue bullshit, the owner BANNED Maki. Maki had a huge tantrum at her admin friend Blue, and Blue unbanned her. Eventually the owner left the server! THE OWNER LEFT BECAUSE SHE COULDN\u2019T TAKE THIS CHILD\u2019S BULLSHIT! So after some other things, and Maki causing even MORE drama, and Funfetti dying, we got fed up with Maki. Eventually, Maki admitted during a heated fight that she was not 13. She was ELEVEN, which is against Discord\u2019s TOS! Her admin friend tried to back her up, but another admin stepped up and finally banned Maki.\n\nTL;DR: 11 year old lies about her age on discord, joins an RP server, makes a completely useless OC, turns that OC into a mary sue savior, ban evades by getting an admin on her side, and makes the owner quit.",

Then I was told if I could send a picture of myself, which I did not do because \none: I\u2019m not that confident with myself and two: I am not sending a photo of myself to a stranger on the internet. Internet safety 101. Anyway, then he told me that the other girl was twenty-six. I was already getting uncomfortable with the fact that he had asked for a photo of myself and now the other person was basically ten years older than me at the time. So you could imagine my reaction of being extremely uncomfortable when I was asked if I wanted to \u201caudition\u201d for their ERP. It weirded me out so much because we were both minors and he seemed to have no issue with it. So I excused myself and blocked him because I did not want to be apart of that.",

But I still take the time to either honor my commitment and role play, or tell someone that I\u2019m no longer interested.  No excuses, ever. I don\u2019t play this game where I string someone along and then never talk to them again. ESPECIALLY if I DM\u2019d them first. The shit makes 0 sense. How are you gonna message me about a role play and then leave me hanging?\n\nI don\u2019t have to know anyone, or be friends with anyone.

If you are not a mod, it is hard to tell how demanding this 'job' can be.\n\n\\-if you never try to write or rarely write a black/autistic/fat/trans/disabled/(can be applied to many things) character in roleplays, you will most likely not encounter as many people who react negatively as a person who writes a lot of characters who belong to these groups. \n\n\\-If you aren't a woman who roleplays (or someone who writes mostly female characters), don't go around saying 'Male roleplayers never harassed me personally, I think the whole thing is blown out of proportion/you must have done something to attract the wrong people.'\n\n\\-And if you don't roleplay male characters for hetero romance roleplays, you don't know how pushy, demanding and even creepy female roleplayers can get. Seriously, the amount of people who never do but have this image of female roleplayers as people who never push for smut or engage in questionable behavior (except for maybe writing self-insert/Mary Sues) is insane.

I know this is annoying but i try to say if they can rp rn or if we can continue the rp and they say yes but they never actually do it???\n\nAt first they seemed to be interested but after just one day of rping they stopped replying??? So i had to see if they were alright and i asked them if we could continue and still no response.\n\nI even tried asking them if they want a another plot or rp but they said they liked the way it is so i didnt question it any further ;w;\n\nI rly want advice and i want their true thoughts on the rp ;-;",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I hope all of ya'll are having a good day. If not, my DM's are open to talk.   \n\n\nI've been running around with this phrase with so many past partners and even people who view my work, and I once found it entertaining, but now I feel as if I'm the \"scary, intimidating\" monster here. Countless times I talk with my partners, sharing ideas back and forth, and there will be a time where I will show them a starter that I wrote in the past, or a work of mine that I have done for a previous person.   \nOnce they have finished, I can tell immediately something is off. Their chat responses are cut short, they seem to avoid me, and once I ask them, \"Hey, something the matter? Was it too much? Did I cross a boundary line I didn't know of?, etc.\" and their responses follow the lines of: \"Your work is scary, you wrote a lot for just a simple response, you're very intimidating when it comes to Rping, etc.\"   \nI get it. I write a lot. I can't help it that I want my partner to see my vision with my words- practically painting a movie scene that they can walk around and visualize the talking, the actions, etc. I pour in a lot of my words into it just so the RP doesn't end up bursting into flames, becomes an insta-killer, etc.   \n\n\nPlease understand that I can't just do a simple sentence or two just to reply and call it good. I need to add that flair, add that detail, the juiciness so that it's perfect for my partner to reply in our out of character chat and be like: \"WHOA DUDE, YOU DID \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* JUST DO THAT!!! I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING!! GET READY FOR MY RESPONSE.\"   \nrather than writing like three words and them not saying anything, just a plain bland crouton of a response.   \n\n\nHas anyone else had this experience before? What do you usually do when this happens? Like I said, I used to take this as a compliment of them appreciating the hard work that I put into it, but now I feel as if this is too much to handle for a person who isn't used to that line of work. Not to mention, I feel as if I scare a lot of my partners away and they don't wanna RP with me because of that.",

            "selftext": "Aight sorry yall but the anger is back and it's coming at you hot on the subject of one of the weirdest red flags I've ever seen. \n\nSo, because I tend to find better visual representations in this medium, I tend to use illustrated character refs more than photographs. If you think this is a problem or I'm wrong for using illustrations, this is where I suggest you stop reading and leave this post.... gone? Stunning. So yeah I tend to use illustrated refs more. Am I against photos? HELL NO. My personal prefecnes are illustrated, description and then photographs. But if someone sends me a photograph ref, I will continue to rp with them if they tick all the other boxes. Like decent writing, compatibility and you know....RESPECT. I'll just need to take a minute to find a photo ref. Now this all sounds fine and dandy right? I'm willing to compromise on an essentially TINY factor of a good rp experience. But this one lady.... simply wasn't having it. \n\nShe texts me and ticks all these boxes for me and I'm actually really excited for it. She sends in a photograph ref, I say \"cool, let me just go grab a ref\". She goes \"oh you don't have refs saved?\" I think this is a little nosey but I continue with \"not photos. I normally use illustrated,\" AND THIS MY DARLINGS IS WHEN SHIT GOT WEIRD. She says \"Ok sorry but I don't want to rp now\" I accept this and go \"up to you but might I ask why?\"......\"because even if you send a photo ref I know you'll re-imagine my ref as a some weird anime shit. I'm not into being visualised like that\"...........WHAT THE ACTUAL F-\n\nSTORY NUMBER 2.\n\nAnd this one is once again....classic creepy guy disrespecting boundaries. \n\nWe start talking, things are a little slow but his ideas are admittedly great. I ask for a ref and he says his profile pic is his ref. Average white dude. I say \"lit let me go and find a photo ref\" and what does this man say? Guess. Guess. Take a guess..... \"Hey if my ref is actually me I think I have the right to see a pic of you. You know me so I think it'd be respectful for you to show your face.\"\n\nInstant block.",

            "selftext": " So I'm in a bit of a rut here.    \nMy friend is a **VERY STRICT** straight male who has a irl girlfriend (no bullsh\\*t). We both play an MMO and were both in a guild that I own and we do all kinds of content available (including some light RP). As for him, hes really into the Roleplaying community. I have no problem with him roleplaying, the only problem I have is the character he enjoys roleplaying as, which is a hot blonde lesbian character.  When he roleplays as her, hes mentioned ALOT that his character is a **strict lesbian** (yes, exactly like that). The way he acts is simply refusing to interact with any male avatars/players of the sorts and if the case to be extremely nasty towards them, But if its a female avatar. he'll be gentle and sweet. So from that, I would assume he's always trying to score female players in game whether is just regular RP or ERP.   \nI don't know exactly what he does nor care of his actions. What I'm more concerned about is his mentality when roleplaying as said character. He has a tendency to go to Roleplaying to in-game Venues that have the \\[18+ LGBTQ+\\] Tags on them and ONLY goes to them and each time I see a different female avatar standing by our guild house. This has been happening for the past 2 years now. \n\nA couple of weeks back, that same friend commented to me that he was gonna be *\"busy\"* on Pride Month in the game cause that's when a lot of RP in-game venues open and celebrate Pride Month. Me as a Bisexual woman, I really couldn't help but give him the stink eye and feel slightly offended. Cause I personally feel like he's just treating Pride Month as a reason/excuse to score with Gay girls online. It makes me uncomfortable not to mention makes me feel bad for the ACTUAL LGBTQ+ people he's probably interacted/rp'd with. I understand that roleplaying is a way to escape and go into a fantasy and you can be who you want. But it feels weird an creepy that he uses the *\"It's just RP\"* excuse to basically almost be catfishing gay girls online. Again, I could be wrong. He does enjoy meeting others in game and such. But I have witnessed him being rude to other male players and he has tried to make a move on my character as well when I'm just trying to socialize. \n\nI came here to ask if its just all in my head or to probably find a clear answer and give me something to help me confront him about it. I have personally asked a few of my other friends on it, and they tell me that is downright offensive to the LGBTQ community and they say that it seems predatory which worries me deeply. But in the end, I don't really think he's hurting anyone in the slightest either. It's made me uncomfortable for years and his last comment is where I kinda drew the line on it.   \n\nAnyways; This is my first post , I kinda wanted to blow off some steam. \\^\\^  Thank you for reading!   \nIf you have an opinion please comment.",

            "selftext": "I just had a cackle when I read a message from a partner. I'm relieved and both disappointed because you know how it goes broken promises and all. I not only just deleted the discord server but I; Unfriended, removed, blocked, and deleted our PM here on reddit as well. The flow was alright and it was fun for a few days then they started to try and combine rp with my personal life. They mentioned how they love the idea I was role-playing with other guys and it gets them off nlt only that but they loved how I wrote erotic themes they started talking about my real life body asking about tattoos or piercings and if I'd be interested in giving them to my character I respectfully declined but when I tell you this guy was a huge douche....wowza..\n\nA few red flags aside the getting personal thing was comments they made. \"I enjoy writing with other people so I picked up a few more partners, I don't like feeling like I'm a tied down boyfriend.\" This comment happened after I explained to them I would be drinking with my husband and sister in law so my focus would be split for the evening, my sister in law is controlling and anytime I made an attempt to pick up my phone and respond she would yell and get in my face to put the phone down so I thought my warning would be enough. Turns out he had a hissy fit because my time was supposed to be focused on him even after I told him I'm drinking and hanging with my family irl.\n\nHe had the nerve to tell me. \"Well it sounds like excuses.\" Even after I explained my controlling sister in law and how I had every intention to respond. Then when I tried to explain again he got over analytical and tried to change the subject. Another red flag was when he straight out told me. \"I don't like the thought of you waiting on me, there's going to be time when I want to play with other people for weeks or days and I'll feel like I'm disappointing you.\" I already explained to him im used to it, eventually people bail out and find something more exciting there's nothing wrong with that. I expressed how I was happy for him he found other partners and told him whenever he had free time I don't mind responding. He thought he was a hot shot and I was relying on him but I again explained I have multiple partners, they're just inactive at the moment and some don't really keep up with my pace that well. Today he said he wanted to end it and I was happy to, I already knew it'd not work out and I'm yet again disappointed over another failed partnership. It bothers me a bit because he promised over and over he wasn't like that and he'd not bail but he did. He said the reason so many people bailed is most likely my fault, then he got pissy because I made a valid point about my real life comes first before rp and I told him I was drinking for one night he went and picked up multiple partners then ditched out of spite.",

My first partner was my writing partner for 5 years. A long time! And a lot of it was fun. However, now that I\u2019ve really thought about it, they weren\u2019t a great role playing partner for a few reasons. I might make multiple posts, because five years is a lot to cover. \n\nI\u2019ll start where I began noticing problems; it was about 3 years after we\u2019d been roleplaying. In those three years, they\u2019d mostly been the one coming up with plots and character arcs. For a bit of background, we had a sci fi themed rp. Aliens and such. It was a good story, but...\n\nA lot of my characters felt stagnant. While theirs had plenty of time in the spotlight, many of mine were left without a lot of development and felt like side characters. So, I discussed a loose plot with them to maybe give a few of my characters some much needed arcs, and they were all on board! ... so I thought. \n\nAs I went ahead with my plot development, I noticed their posts become increasingly lackluster. I\u2019d give them the usual two-three paragraphs, and they\u2019d give me ... maybe 2 sentences in return. Their characters acted cold to mine when they asked for help in defeating the Big Baddie of the plot, even though these OCs of mine had helped theirs through two years of trouble. \n\nI thought, hey, that\u2019s weird... but I went ahead, since they hadn\u2019t given me any indicator OOC that they were disinterested in my plot. And then, just as things were reaching peak development, they suddenly introduced new villains and issues and announced they had another arc idea for their main oc. \n\n... oh. \n\nI thought, well, lets combine our plots! Lets have them tie into one another. \n\n... and when I wouldn\u2019t take the spotlight completely off my character, they stopped replying to our thread altogether and presented a new rp idea for a different universe entirely. The plot was interesting so I agreed, and they proceeded to shine the spotlight ONLY on their character, and when I requested mine have a minute, would get bored and start a new RP. \n\nThis was a running cycle until they got me into a popular MMORPG and we moved off discord. \n\nBack then, this was about the most annoying thing they did and I let it slide because our writing meshed well and I was nervous to get involved with another person in the hobby. I\u2019ll write a part 2 later, because things got a lot more intense when we roleplayed on the game \u2014 this was mostly just some background information to set the stage. :) things get juicier.",

Though it seems like the use of punctuation has gone out the window, its either non-existent or is only used when the writer feels like it. I'm not talking about OOC talk because I couldn't care less how someone talks there. If we are IC and there's one ONE period at the end of each paragraph or none at all it makes it hard to want to continue the role. Its extremely noticeable when its multi-para replies. I feel like its more prevalent now that I'm in group roleplays but I have encountered them in the 1\u00d71 scene as well.",
