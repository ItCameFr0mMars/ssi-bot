At this point, I pretty much gained knowledge about romance from books, comics, movies etc and I have no actual real life experiences. And for whatever reason, I like playing as guys. \n\nI still remember that it was a forum rp, a kinda community-ish rp where you can join the group and then go to, say,  the 'kitchen', and just start interacting with people there. \n\nI can't remember if my character is dating this character or he was just flirting, but I was really playing him as this kind of flirty playboy. We were at the kitchen and the girl was eating sandwich. And.... For whatever reason that I can't even fathom right now, my character kissed her....and then....insert his tongue in her mouth..and...take the sandwich inside her mouth...and eat it himself...before grinning/smirking as if that was the most sexy thing to do.\n\n*silent, internal screaming*\n*more silent, internal screaming*\n\nIt probably felt cheeky? Playful? Flirty? to me at that time, but now, I'm screaming to myself every time I remember this.\n\nHope that at least get a chuckle out of someone. Thank you for reading.",

The owner needed help getting things started and I was looking for a group to join so it seem perfect. Everything seemed fine at first, they were super sweet and welcoming. Once people started to join that they seemed attracted to is where it started to go down hill. If one mentioned a certain feature that they had they would drool all over them, making some uncomfortable. \n\nThey then made a channel where members could post selfies but spammed the channel with theirs almost everyday, but always referred to themselves as ugly when they 100% knew they weren't. They pushed others to send selfies especially the ones they thought were attractive. If they were indeed up to their standards they would then make more inappropriate comments, even though they have a partner irl who knows nothing of what they do online. \n\nNow when it came to the actual roleplaying I thought things would be okay since I tend to ignore the OOC anyway. Well I was wrong once again. They keep changing the rules and character cap to fit their needs. In a short few weeks they have made more than 5 characters so that they have constant interaction. Which leaves other members without scenes because they always pop up when someone asks to do one. Not everyone wants scenes with 3+ people thats nothing but flirting. They pull them into already established scenes without asking the other people in them if its okay. They want all their characters to have established ships but try to break ships up to keep the server from dying. It just feels like they should be doing 1\u00d71's instead of making a group. \n\nThis was my last straw for rp servers, I honestly think I'm done. Many owners do the same thing this owner is doing.",

            "selftext": "Character writing is hard. \n\nand I don't know if this is common or not, but I find myself often struggling to portray a character (Even my own) consistently throughout a roleplay. They'll start off pretty in-character than they gradually start slipping... Kinda like a rockslide. You can't stop it, only watch in horror as is escalates.\n\nI'll write them in their character sheet as a pretty complex character with complex morals and what not, but I find that difficult to portray in the actual storyline. They'll just be bland and one-dimensional in the roleplay. It hasn't cost me any partners because they don't usually care much about my characters as much as their own or the few canon characters I write, but it really bugs me. Then I'll want to rewrite them and I never end up doing it because of burnout and lack of motivation \ud83d\ude2b. \n\nIt's one thing to say Character B has a tragic past and obvious signs of mental illness, but to show that is an entirely different thing. I don't want to romanticize it, so I don't tend to specify anything, but you can't just drop that part of their character off entirely either when you feel like it. And it's shamefully easy to do, I genuinely hate knowing that something I write isn't realistic enough or is shitting on the character, and these things woosh over my head all the time till I post it and I can't edit what has already been seen.  \n\nMaybe one day I'll realize \"Oh maybe Character A should've reacted differently to this incident....\" \"Oh yeah, Character B HAS a backstory that I should utilize\" before I post, but for now I'll just take the L and  hope I learn eventually. :(",

They just look back on some old roleplays they participated in and visibly cringe at how bad they are or grimace at all the petty squabbles that took place in them. Particularly in group roleplays. A lot of these old roleplay forums still exist, and while we wish they'd just cease existence, they'll remain up as long as the website they're hosted on exists...\n\nBy no means was I a perfect little angel, I joined a few groups when I was around 10 or 11 and experienced some of my first roleplays on there. Of course, my writing was horrific, but people treated me relatively decent. It shocks me nobody pointed out how bad I was because I certainly wasn't self-aware. These places became some of the first \"friend groups\" I ever had online, and maybe that's what prevented anybody from saying anything directly, but I wish they did. It sounds like a bunch of conniving teenage girls, but I witnessed so much passive aggressiveness behavior on some of those groups between other people or myself. I one time had someone message me stating something on the lines of  \"Person A hates you, I don't know why, but they do.\" And it was the start of so much shit no 10-year-old should have definitely dealt with. Like how can a writing group have so much drama?\n\nA lot of them also had absolutely no moderation, so you could imagine what that led to...  \ud83d\ude2c\n\nMaybe that's why I've stuck to 1x1 over the years. I've seen interesting concepts advertised in group roleplays, but from what people who joined have told me, they never get anywhere. Everyone either ghosts or someone steals the concept, and these 'cliques' are formed. Horror stories like that just make newcomers want to run for the hills.",

            "selftext": "Long time lurker, but first time posting. Apologizes for how long this will be. So I\u2019ve been rping for around six or seven years now after a irl friend got me into it (started around 12 or 13). So there was a time when I was underage and actively roleplaying. Now, not one of my friends or family members really knows about this (told mom once and she freaked and told me to stop). After my mom\u2019s adverse reaction, I kinda just kept it more of a secret. You might be wondering why I\u2019m sharing this, but it will make sense later. \n\nUp until my junior year of high school, I was a total noob and didn\u2019t even know there was a semi-huge community for this. I was searching for a long-term partner I really vibes with and used Shamchat since it was the only website I knew that some people RPed on (I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called, although I think it\u2019s defunct now). I primarily do horror, and much to no avail found no one. Hey, I get it, not eveyone\u2019s cup of tea. Until I joined Reddit. Made my first post, and thought it would be another failure. Well, I was wrong.\n\nI got a lot of interested surprisingly. No one really stood out and I had to weed through a lot of the creeps. I was recently 17 (we met a couple of days before my birthday) at the time, and still very uncomfortable with NFSW. Didn\u2019t really vibe with anyone until I talked a little more with this girl (I\u2019ll call her Jules). Although she was around eight years older, she was cool and patient with me and an extremely talented writer. She asked me if I was 18, and I lied and told her yes. Now, I know I shouldn\u2019t of lied but she was the only person I truly connected with and hey, it was only one year off and it wasn\u2019t even a remotely NFSW plot. \n\nSo we start the roleplay and everything goes great, there\u2019s a couple of bumps in the road but she acknowledges it and we work together to get through it. She\u2019s an excellent writer and our styles work beautifully. Things go great until she suddenly asks for a photo. I send her one, and she sends me one. I don\u2019t know if it was because she had terrible self-esteem or what but kept telling me how pretty I was and how ugly she was. I\u2019m uncomfortable, but laugh it off. I know she\u2019s bi (so am I) but some part of me felt like she was crossing a boundary and was actively flirting. Weird, but it didn\u2019t last for long. \n\nThings are going well until suddenly, they aren\u2019t. After asking to do a spin off of my character as a Nazi and hers as a Jew (most of my extended family is Jewish and I politely decline albeit I\u2019m a bit weirded out) Jules falls out of interest, and I feel like I\u2019m actively trying to please her to continue the main story. She jokingly starts telling me that if I want things to continue, I have to start paying her. At this point, I was willing to and desperately abiding to everything she asked in hopes that we continue. I feel like at this point she\u2019s just dragging me along for the ride, while I\u2019m desperately trying to get things to go back to normal. I can\u2019t even go to our server any more without feeling an overwhelming sense of dread. \n\nThings get even weirder, and suddenly she pulls a 180 and begins using racial slurs (using the n-word when she was clearly white) and starting fights with me for no reasons. She now starts telling me how weird and strange I am, and is replying less and less to my messages and is overly aggressive. Then, she finally cuts me off and tells me she doesn\u2019t want any more contact and she\u2019s grown sick of me. I\u2019m devastated, and I can\u2019t even tell my mom about it due to fear of her freaking out. And this wasn\u2019t just for a couple of months, it was for nearly a year and a half. All the secrets and good times we\u2019ve had (she shared a lot of trauma and so did I) are gone. We\u2019re still friends in Discord, but I haven\u2019t messaged her since last April. I can\u2019t even think of her without feeling sick. \n\nNever told anyone this before, and I\u2019m glad I still have three great partners and I\u2019ve moved on somewhat although I definitely miss her sometimes. Sorry it\u2019s long, but had to get it off my chest. I think she definitely was very emotionally manipulative and needed to figure some things out on her own.\n\nTLDR: partner of a year and a half that I loved writing and talking with suddenly gets aggressive and starts using racial slurs and wants to use the Holocaust as one of our plots. I decline and she cuts me off.",

Well I was wrong, very very wrong. \n\nWhile I had heard godmoddimg had become bad in those types of roles I didn't know how bad. It seemed like almost every person who replied thought it would be okay to control my character, making them do things they would never ever do. \n\nWhen I called them out politely they would either just leave, get mad, or blatantly laugh at me. It made me feel stupid which has never happened in my many years of roleplaying.

            "selftext": "I've been writing since I started hanging out with rpers I crossed on facebook some ten years. And to this day, I still find myself caught in the same morbid cycle that has plagued me from rp community to rp community. Whether it be sometimes facebook's, to Aniroleplay, to some servers on Disboard, or even here. I've always found myself approaching others with story ideas and in many cases. I am either passed up or told that these concepts are just too complicated.  \n\n\nMany times over, I run into writers who seem to have really high opinions for this kind of thing. And I don't know whether or not the effort of just writing a story is lost to me at the point or it's just common to not seek some grand story throughout the time. Writing with partners that burn out and move onto other things pretty quickly or facing writers that try to change the entire narrative in favor of what suits a need on occasion.   \n\n\nI've been writing a lot recently, a story that takes place in a world labeled after the Underdark. Where stone faces dot the earth, humans are twisted bottom of the barrel prey to demons, and beasts alike who sit in the throne of the favored beneath the twisted Greek gods above them and telling stories from there for some time. To which, I have often found myself added by others who take interest in the horror and adult themes centered the story, though many often tell me it's either too complicated for their wishes or that it's just something that belongs in a book rather than roleplay.   \n\n\nDoes that make sense? I really do wonder, because it doesn't feel at all like it should and in light of that. I still find myself questioning the logic of those statements as they seem to come frequently. I have been writing this project and building this world for little over a year now. It's something I think I'd wanted to make my staple and just experiment with as I go. Though I frequently receive dejection despite interest? Is this sort of thing commonplace?",

            "selftext": "This is a different account from the one I've had this problem on lately. \n\nI exclusively do ERP. I really enjoy finding great partners who share my interests and writing fun stories with them. However, it's fair to say my tastes or kinks are pretty niche. Finding partners who like the same things I do in the same ways have always been a struggle. I know when my partners and I have found each other we have sometimes kept writing for years. \n\nSo, the disappointment comes from the number of recent conversations I've had with potential partners who have fizzled out. This has always been something that has happened since I started roleplaying, but lately I had a really awful experience with it.\n\nA potential partner replied to one of my prompts. They were very excited and shared with me a number of ideas they had for it that I thought were great. They shared their kinks and we were very closely aligned. We discussed some story ideas and shared how excited we were to write it out. I thought this was the start of a beautiful exchange! \n\nImagine my surprise when I went to reply to their message the next morning and saw their accounts were deleted! \n\nI'm used to partners coming and going, but this one really sucked. I'm used to potential partners dropping off after a couple of messages back and forth, but this was a good discussion on setup before we began writing and exchanged a couple of posts for the first scene. Obviously I hope nothing bad happened on their end. I reposted the prompt hoping that if they merely had to drop their accounts they would message again - but no luck. \n\nIn short - it really sucks and feels bad when someone disappears, especially when finding a match can be very challenging.",

            "selftext": "I have never had good luck with RP partners. For a long time, I was on sites that consisted of week-long RPs that don't go anywhere. And then I switched to a more sophisticated forum setting - had a little bit searching - and suddenly, I found this wonderful partner. We responded to the RP at least 2 times every day for a year and half. Suddenly, though, things changed. Responses just became less frequent. Which was fine for me, because we developed a really good friendship. We would send each other funny posts about our OCs, make headcanons, talk about things we wanted to do later in the RP.\n\nWell, they've been busy with their life, and I have been too. Responses slowed to an absolute halt in the past 6 months. Whenever I would get a response though, I always made it a mission to respond in a timely manner. I just loved our RP and couldn't get enough. Recently, after bringing up to them that I was considering RP searching again (it's hot as balls out here... I feel like I'm wasting away doing nothing but looking at social media and playing video games all day), they revealed that they just haven't had as much fun with the medium as they used to (EDIT: also mentioned that they don't have the energy to respond even if they did have the time to) and apologized for not responding. They swore it wasn't the end, but I see it that way. How are we going to continue our story without writing it out?? We're not. I'm so, so upset. We had planned on so much within the RP and we'll never go through with it. I respect their decision and their feelings - we're growing up now, things are just different. I've never had to deal with this before, though. I've never had a RP last more than a month or two. Our RP had lasted almost 3 years. Before this, I felt so infallible when it came to RPing. I felt no connection to any of my partners - maybe a twinge of hurt when a good one ghosted. But this is something that is ending against my will, not because we both agreed to quit while we're ahead, but because I was so caught up in something that wouldn't go farther than where it is now. And I kept holding out hope, all of this time!\n\nI wanted to search for partners, but now it just feels like I'll never find a better partner. It's self-fulfilling, but I'm telling you, I've had a jackshit RPing experience before them. They were not a bad RP partner - pretty much the best one I've ever had. But this experience is tearing me to bits. I just wanted to share - see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Maybe how they dealt with it?",

Whom I had commissioned an artist to create a digital reference for and then some time later commissioned another artist for just some art of, said second artist (Nekolychee via deviantart) was a rather popular character to be stolen and used by others of the WoF community, obviously I never gave permission to anyone to use her as she is a very personal character to me. \n\nAnd all honestly I'm going to start exposing anyone who decides to steal any of my characters, and I'm not going to be nice about it either because I don't tolerate this kind of shit.",

We have a great roleplay and it\u2019s very sweet and wholesome. Normally I tend to stay away from ooc chat or keep it to a minimum because I\u2019ve had bad experiences with it? But I decided to talk to him.\n\nWe played games, talked everyday, said good morning and good night and I showed him what I looked like. I found out that he basically based his character off himself so I thought he would be.. somewhat close to his character. I had this perfect idea of him and I actually really liked speaking with him.\n\nHe then felt comfortable enough to show me what he looked like and I feel horrible for even saying this but when I saw him I was disappointed. He\u2019s absolutely amazing and sweet. But.. I didn\u2019t think his looks would matter until he actually showed me.\n\nAm I wrong for feeling this way? What should I do about it? I don\u2019t want to be hurtful because again he\u2019s awesome but now there\u2019s\u2026 a disconnect if that makes sense?",
