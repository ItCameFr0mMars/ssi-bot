            "selftext": "So this post is going to be long and all over the place so bear with me!\n\nI used to roleplay on and off for about 6 years and I never ever allowed my standards to go down just for the sake of having a nice roleplay.\n\nHowever, during quaranting I:\n\n\n1. lowered my standards and did things that I don't agree with and don't align with my beliefs, which I truly regret.\n\n\n2. Got very very very obsessed with roleplaying and it became more than just addiction.\n\n\n3. Spoiled a lot of films just to be able to roleplay with some specific people.\n\n\nNow I hate what I did and it has been linked in my memory with roleplay. So now, roleplay is a big no no to me even though I still really like it.\n\nI fear roleplaying just because I'm afraid I might lose my standards to others just for the sake of being nice/hating to say no or because I really want to do this certain roleplay with that specific person.\n\nBut that's not the only problem. I developed this new habit of wanting\u2014Desiring to roleplay about anything I watched recently and liked. Let's say I watched The Maze Runners, then I'll have to roleplay it or else I won't feel like I reached this weird satisfaction with my obsession with that certain franchise or whatever. I don't know it's just so weird and I feel like I'm rambling and venting like crazy.\n\nAnyways, my question is; how to stop being interested in roleplaying anything you like or like having roleplay on your mind the whole time?",

I've had so many bad experiences writing with men that at this point I don't feel comfortable writing with them at all, and I say that in my ad, in the very 2nd paragraph and yet some people still don't bother to read it. Not to mention the number of people who message me and say they write \"one to two paragraphs per reply\" even though I state in my ad that I average 600+ words and am looking for someone who can do the same. I wrote everything in my ad for a reason, why do people seem to not want to read it but message me anyway? Seriously I've considered quitting writing for good because the overwhelming majority of people who message me just seem incapable of reading my ads istg. \n\nAnd then when it comes to NSFW there's all the people who say \"Don't put a label on your characters\" or the even worse \"They have to switch for the relationship to be equal\" or finally the \"Sub and bottom mean the same thing.\" People are allowed to have preferences. Don't shame people for having them. If you don't, that's fine, but don't police other people. Also why are people unaware that power bottoms exist? Or assume that all bottoms are whiney and useless and weak? One of my fav characters I've written is Definitely a bottom but he can and will absolutely wipe the floor with guys three times his size. His preference in the bedroom doesn't define his personality.\n\nI'll probably post more horror stories on this sub later on because I definitely have Many",

Another thing is that, when I post up a list of prompt ideas and ask that if you're wanting to rp, let me know what idea appeals to you and all seem to do is PM me with, \"Hey, saw your ad, read your ad, wanna rp?\" I apologize if I come off as harsh here but clearly you didn't read it when I asked IN my ad that there's a list of prompts, pick one! \n\nI'm honestly getting tired of it and it seems like people are just skimming through it and then fire off a PM request. \n\nAnother thing is that I'll get a server set up and ready to go on Discord, I let my partner know that, hey, due to work, the starter might be delayed but I'll get it up soon as I can. Get everything ready to go and... I'm waiting. \n\nWaiting and waiting. \n\nA week goes by and still nothing. I send off a pm asking if they're still interested and another day goes by with nothing. Next day, they've gone and left the server without saying anything. \n\nIf you weren't interested in the thread, why did you reach out in the first place? \n\nI totally understand that life gets in the way and all that but if anything just let your partner know that you're gonna be delayed by a few days, maybe a week at most. \n\nThe lack of communication is astounding. \n\nI just wanted to get this off my chest as I've had this happen time in and time out and I am honestly done with it.",

            "selftext": "I've had so many bad experiences with partners coming to me with pre-built worlds that I just refuse to work with them at this point tbh. Fandoms are different but if my partner already has a worldbuild, tbh it always just feels like they've already written the story without me and there's no place for me in it. Rp's supposed to be a collaboration. Anyway, this is a more specific story about probably the worst case of this I've found. \n\nThis was way back when I used to write with men and I used to write MxF. So this guy comes to me and he has this OC he prefers to play in this world. But not only that, on his rp ad doc, he has a list of names for me to chose from for my character, tells me what body type he wants, even the hair colour had to be either blonde or wine red. I should've ditched him right then and there tbh but I have a tendancy to be like \"Eh fuck it we'll see how much of a train wreck this becomes.\" \n\nSo, we start the rp, my character's a princess, so I describe her hairstyle as some elaborate half-up half-down situation. Super pretty, I send a reference photo. It's not overly complicated but it's respectable for nobility. He makes some snarky comment like \"Why not just have it down normally?\" .... because my character is royalty and makes an effort to look a little nicer? But no he wants to control my character even down to her hairstyle. \n\nSo at this point I've had it so I say \"If you'd like to control ever aspect of my character, then write her yourself\" and we have a fight and I'm like \"I don't think this is going to work out, goodbye\" he makes a comment calling me a quitter and telling me he thinks it could work out if we just tried again. And do you ever get to that mindstate where you say \"Fine\" and go with it out of sheer rage and spite? Yeah that was me, so I was like \"Fukkin alright if you're so convinced this'll work out, then stop controlling every aspect of my character\" he says he doesn't and is fine with whatever happens which is absolute bullshit. \n\nThen he says he doesn't want to work with the character I made for him because this entire argument has soured that character for him, so I'm like \"Fukkin whatever\" I make up a new character, she's an FBI agent or something? I forget. But I suggest that maybe his character's also an FBI agent (or maybe my character was a con artist and it was a White Collar type situation? I don't remember lol) and he's immediately like \"No, I'm playing this character.\" \"....you can't play that character... as an FBI agent?\" \"No I don't want to\" but he refused to work with me on anything else and he would only play that character in that setting in that world build. \n\nSo basically he wants to control every aspect of my character down to her name and hairstyle, but he refuses to work with me on even the smallest detail about his character.... dude just write the book yourself. So I tell him to fuck off and he sends me a message like \"This wasn't going to work out.\" As if I didn't literally already tell him that.\n\nI get I kinda walked into it because I didn't tell him to fuck off immediately, but seriously what is with people?? I guess I went with it for a while because I had a feeling it'd make one hell of a story... and it did, and here I am.",

            "selftext": "I was invited to join a roleplay group by one of its moderators, and I ended up making the deadline. I had to draw/write a character profile/etc. to get in. It took me a lot of time and effort. Everyone seemed pretty nice as I was in the process of joining. Everything seemed fun and since it took me so much time I followed through and ended up joining. It is in a big community there is at least 92 people.  \n\n\nAs soon as I got in I came to quickly realize that the group has a lot of cliques. Older members not really acknowledging new members. As well as old members tending to be more involved with each other than new people. I ended up realizing I don't *feel* very welcome. Even some of the new members don't really seem to want to engage with me. Some people have, but I notice its either to see if I will 'ship' my character with theirs, or just superficial conversation. I don't see myself connecting with anyone, and a lot of times I am a little shy. So when I talk in the chat I get washed out, or sometimes I am met with condescending attitudes. Either way, there is not a lot going on. It feels like the moderators have their own things going on, spending time with each other, while the members are scattered into their own groups.  \n\n\nIt has only been 6 days since I got in. I do like some people and they are very nice to me. Including one of the mods, but otherwise. I don't think I am close enough with anyone to want to say. This seems to be a reoccurring thing in groups from what I observe. A lot of them have the same issues and I do not know if I can ever really find a proper community of rpyers anymore. Since I know I have my issues. I don't know if it is best for me to stay there. It is just hard since it has only been such a short time. I feel like I am quitting, but none of this seems to be going well and I cannot engage with anyone, or join in on the fun because so far a lot of the chat seems rather harsh, or too much is going on, its hard to keep up.",

            "selftext": "Hi all! I just discovered this sub not too long ago! I have seen a lot of really helpful advice given to one another so I thought, \u201cHey, maybe someone would be able to help me!\u201d \n\nI have been roleplaying with this guy for almost a year now! We get along nice, he\u2019s a very sweet guy, and sometimes we chat ooc about games! (We both really enjoy playing pc games.)\n\nRewind to almost a year ago: He messages me about an ad I had posted, I accept, we move over discord as one usually does! We throw ideas back and forth, get a good plot idea going, and BOOM! That starts the journey of our story together! \n\nIt was a really fun and interesting story at first! There was a lot of tension, drama, etc! However, from day one his writing and posts were always in reaction to my posts! He never added anything to our story which was fine in the beginning because when a story starts you have so much ground to cover, so I was able to pull ideas from all over. One year later and his posts are still only ever a reaction to what my character is doing. I\u2019m left playing ALL and EVERY side character. This story has left me feeling like it\u2019s a job to respond, which sucks because I genuinely enjoy and love the characters and his writing style. (He isn\u2019t a bad writer!)\n\nSince I am the only one ever progressing the story, sometimes I leave him for DAYS without an answer, in extreme cases a week or two because I just don\u2019t have the energy or creativity to create a response to keep this story going. It feels like I am just writing a book on my own with his character responding and reacting to whatever I do.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do! At this point this story has sucked so much creativity and energy out of me that I don\u2019t even know if I want to continue, but he\u2019s such a nice guy and a lovely writer! I also have grown attached to our characters! I just wish he would put in the effort that I do. At first I thought he just wasn\u2019t really into it, but every time I leave for a few days he will always send me messages that let me know he\u2019s looking forward to my response and such. \n\nHow would you approach this situation? I\u2019m not a confrontational person, which is probably why I\u2019ve let this go on for a year now. So I can totally blame myself in that.",

            "selftext": "On some roleplaying sites/forums this is so common, and I really dislike it. For example, people can choose stuff like 'Just Sex' or 'No Sex', or other stuff like 'mxm' or 'fxm' so that when you search for specific things, their roleplays show up in the right category and it is easier to find roleplays that include your interest. But an awful lot of people tag their ERPs (like, stuff that is only ERP, not even the hint of story) with 'No sex' to get more clicks. So when I search for roleplays without any sexual content, I am suddenly confronted with graphic ERP stuff.\n\nLast week, a girl approached me for a roleplay, I looked at their search and their possible pairings were 'mxm, fxm, fxf', and in her profile it said that she writes male and female characters, and she is also interested in non-romance. Great! I talked to her for a while, only to find out that she doesn't really write male characters, has never written them, and she also does not write anything expect fxm where she writes the female role. The roleplay did not work out (for different reasons, basically she was just looking for someone to torture her female character), but: Your profile should include your real preferences, so that people know what they are getting into. \n\nAnd I see this a lot. People will list a lot of stuff in their search that they are (allegedly) willing to write, but when you talk to them, they admit that they never wrote it and have not interest in writing it, and that they are really looking for something else. \n\nIf you say stuff like 'Hm, I was really looking for (thing they said they were willing to write), I don't think this will work out' they often beg for me to stay, saying that they will not find anyone else to write their preferences with, and it is always super uncomfortable.\n\nYes, I know that more people are looking for someone who writes male roles, or for someone who writes a top in mxm (I saw this a lot with mxm searches, although I don't even write smut), but if you try to attract writing partners by blatantly lying about what you will write so that more people will reply to your searches, you are wasting everyone's time. Not only theirs, but also you own.\n\n Believe me, not many people who apply to write one specific thing will suddenly change their preferences just because you try to manipulate them into writing it. If they do, it is most likely that they either a.) end the roleplay soon because they realize that this really isn't their thing or b.) would have replied to your search regardless of this aspect, so you might as well have been truthful.",

            "selftext": "I have been rping for 6 or so years now, most of that not being on Discord specifically, but I have been around the block enough to pick up how the sociology of Roleplay environments tend to form themselves. Just like how society tends to repeats behaviors depending on where you live, roleplay servers tend to repeat themselves even if they try to run it their own way. This is my own observations. Take them with a grain of salt, as they are heavily influenced by negative experiences.   \n\n\n**Dragon Ball Roleplays and GRINDING:**  \n\n\nYou know in JRPGs its common to power level your character to insane levels because the game is sorta built in such a way that sometimes it's required (at least for say, post-game content or insane difficulty spikes)? DBZ servers like to replicate this formula, but the problem is it **doesn't work**. There is a **mechanical** and **social** aspect to this, and I'll talk about them separately.  \n\n\nMechanically, grinding is hard to make fun for those who aren't specifically looking for that. We all know the story of the guy who went from level 1 to level 99 in Final Fantasy 7, but DBZ servers tend to feel like everybody wants to be that dude. Granted I know there needs to be high, low, and mid tiers for the sake of powerscaling. But why **this way** in specific?   \n\n\nThe one glaring issue I see is it doesn't incentivize more **organic** styles of progression like how Dragon Ball typically goes about it. It has its training, but its not **99% training**. That is how Dragonball servers tend to feel. Instead of actually going through an actual **training arc** and moving up based on milestones and benchmarks, your basically doing the rp equivalent of **XP farming**. And that would be FINE, if it wasn't done in a way that isn't exactly fun. It's more like a **gacha/mobile game** in terms of how much a slog it is.   \n\n\nAnd the power gaps even between people of low and mid rank, lets not even talk about high tier people like **Ultra Instinct Goku**, I am talking like most of the actual people whom you'll be interacting with most of the time. The gaps are very wide, and the rate in which you climb is so slow I'd feel like I'd turn 80 by the time I reach a **DECANT** level.   \n\n\nThat isn't even considering how this effects the **community** of those roleplay servers. instead of caring about the world, building bonds and interactions, it usually turns into a dick measuring contest. Because all people care about is being strong enough both have **DECANT** fights, and not get instantly ***ganked*** by the people who are like **5 or 10 times** stronger then you with a **0.5 PL leveling rate**. This tends to breed a very...particular kind of environment where **\"the strong eat the weak\"**, which makes some more weaker races like Humans and Namekians see very little play. You know how DBZ is memed as the \"Goku and Vegeta\" show? Imagine that but its more **\"OOPs! All Sayians\"** show.   \n\n\nMy solution? Do what Toriyama did a fucking years ago already, and **get rid of it**. As a particular three-eyed friend once said: **\"Powerlevels are Bullshit\"**. Use a more merit, benchmark, and milestone based system with **\"Tiers\"** rather then Powerlevel. In fact there is a DBZ place that does this exact thing, and I see plenty of underpowered characters in play constantly. And the sad thing is (not goign to name names for rule-based reasons) this was on a **NSFW rp-focused site**. It should make people embarrassed a **type-fuck site** has a better system then most other normal rp servers. ***Its sad.***  \n\n\n**Catering to Minors and Safespaces:**  \n\n\nI get it, Shonen is mainly geared towards a younger audience. And such, minors have a place. My problem is that, do you know how many servers cater to this? **TOO FUCKING MANY**. To the point that its hard to find a server specifically for a person who likes to rp serious, ecchi, or potentially dark themes even in the context of a Shonen franchise. Does it sound like i am turning a Shonen into a  Seinen? Potentially yes. **And that's where I like it.** Even DBZ can get lewd at times, especially when **Master Roshi** is on the screen. I am not gonna ramble on for more then I need to on this, so I'll leave it with this: We had 4kids. If you wanted this, we could have just brought 4kids back. Yet we canceled the shit out of them **for a reason**.  \n\n\nAnd in case you want to tell me **\"there are mature 18+ version of those places you are talking about, why not just go to those?\"** I have. They tend to be either not very active, near dead, or just doesn't have a ruleset that speaks to me personally. They are also sometimes just plain crap, but that is most Shonen rp servers I have been to.  \n\n\nIn regards to safespaces, oh boy. This is geared towards **My Hero Acadamia** servers in specific. I don't care about your **Triggers**, your **Pronouns**, or what have you. I just want a **normal roleplay server** where I can roleplay without having to be concerned about what I type **every five seconds**. I am not saying these things are not important, but they shouldn't be so important you are literally silencing people's ability to express themselves by making it harder for them to talk or roleplay out a specific kind of action, because they have to put **spoilers over everything**. The only way you can have fun is if your a kid, are willing to remain silent for a good portion of the time.  \n\n\nLiterally only **MHA servers** care about this stuff; even other Shonen rp servers aren't this overly sensitive. And honestly considering the communities **negative reputation**, I can see why. It just makes me feel like I can't express myself without needing to put spoilers over everything I type. if I wanted a safespace, I'd go to a safespace. I ***didn't ask this. Stop.***   \n\n\n**Servers, Lack of Commitment and lack of Competition:**  \n\n\nThis one is very important. It is known throughout history that one of the things that helps humanity improve and innovate, is **necessity**. Necessity brings out the best in us, and it is something Discord servers **didn't get the memo about**. Unlike other roleplay sites, who may have a monetary incentive to put a greater focus on improving to make it high quality, every other Discord server seems to exist in a ***bubble,*** isolated from everyone else.   \n\n\nAnd this is an issue when it comes to issues a server may have and ways to make it better. Most servers, as I talked to, most of the time, quote on quote, **\"don't give a shit about improvement.\"** If there is a problem with a server, tough shit. Deal with it or GTFO. And this leads to most servers just never putting in the effort, because there is ***no need*** to do so. I feel this contributes to the high number of Discord servers that end up going dead, shutting down, or otherwise getting deleted.   \n\n\nWhen there is no competition, there is no drive to improve. And there is a quote that very clearly warns what happens when you stop improving:  \n\n\n***\"******In this world you're either growing, or you're dying, so get in motion and grow.\u201d*** *\u2015 Lou Holtz*  \n\n\nThe overall point is without a reason or need to improve, nothing will get better, and in the end you will be left with a mass supply of mediocre, low-class, low-tier work.",

            "selftext": "I'm in this one rp group and honestly, I love everyone there so much! It's not like any of them are bad at rp or anything, they're amazing and I love to rp with them!!\n\nWe met about a year ago when they were looking for another person to join and I volunteered. It was really fun and I got so attached to these rps and characters! One of them in particular made me so happy. Sadly, everyone just stopped replying in the rp section. We still tall almost daily but, the rp hasn't continued for months on end.\n\nWhat really frustrates me is that we would start up new rps all the time, which isn't bad but, the second we would start a new one, the old one/s stopped. The only reason this frustrated me so much is because we only stopped right before my big story arch. Right before this huge thing that I had been planning out for so long! I haven't gotten to any of the huge things I planned out and it irritates me to no end.\n\nThere's only one rp channel still active and its just smut. Listen, I'm good with smut but I don't know how I feel about doing it with these people in particular and, I don't really want to ask to join in because I don't exactly fit into their little group they have.\n\nI brought up the idea of starting some back up yesterday and only one person responded saying that they were too busy. I don't know what to do at this point because I'd love nothing more than to continue! I'm so attached to these stories and have so much more id like to add on to them.",

A lot of people on that game are just\u2026 absolute wallflowers who offer little substance in their replies, and not only that - the characters are completely lifeless, and only grumble or nod or say a word or two. For reference, my main on that game is a pretty friendly guy and he likes making new friends. \n\nI guess this is an issue on text roleplays too, especially in groups. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an issue with people getting cliquey or what, but it gets old after a while. Anyone else hate characters that just nod or shrug or hum instead of doing anything?",

I've also have my (and a few others) unique experiences with them. \n\nNot only do they ghost people out of the wazoo, it appears as though they can't read ads properly before approaching people and then gets mad at people for telling them that they didn't read their ad.\n\nAlso, they use to go by Kitten as well.\n\nWhen I was actively searching for people, they approached me with one of my ideas and we talked about it and they were initially enthusiastic about it until the prospect of doubling came up. They told me they don't do that and I told them (kindly) that hey, I'm not going to play a male for people I don't know too well. It was bolded AND italized in my ad. \n\nThey then got guilt trippy about the fact that they can't find a good partner and made comments about how I wasn't clear enough in my ad.\n\n/It was bolded and italized in my ad that I double./\n\nI blocked them after a little while and talked to a forever partner about it. She's had a run in with them too, also in the same way.\n\nNot to mention, some of the partners she's had have also had run-ins with them too. They ranged from them ghosting to them being extremely controlling with every aspect of the RP, especially with the other person's character. \n\nI did some digging and they've been posting almost the same ad on Reddit since 2017 under a primary account, hence bringing up the fact that they use to go by Kitten.\n\nBruh, just write solo, please stop posting your ad EVERYWHERE. If you had your way, you'd probably post it on Craigslist! You've been at this for literal years now!",

But this isn't a throwaway account: I post everywhere and have 1200 Karma in just a month or so, so while that's pretty meager, it shows that I'm me and that I'm honestly trying.  \n\nNow then, one of the reasons I joined Reddit was because of a particular community of roleplayers.  So that got me thinking to look for other communities, and I stumbled upon DPP, which is on the whole pretty cool.  Whatever kink or fetish you have that you can't or won't find an outlet for in real life, you can find someone on Reddit to set up a chat or role play with.  Go us, Redditors!\n\nI'm in several role plays, and some are steaming along, some I'm waiting on replies, and some I guess I'll never again get a reply, and that's okay.  People ghost all the time, and I've done it myself in other communities so I can't judge.  Plus that's common enough that I wouldn't even bother making a post about it.  Except for that one lady who wrote a novel-length prompt, I responded with my own, and then I never heard from her again.  That's not bad roleplaying, or even ghosting as she sent me a one-line response saying I was a great writer but she wasn't feeling it.  That broke my heart.   She was also a good writer, but I guess our kinks didn't mesh the way she wanted.  Such is life.\n\nHowever, today's post pertains her exact opposite: a guy who also had set up a really long, really detailed prompt, and who I seemed to totally click with, and who had my exact kinks.  Well, not exact, mirrors of them, so we were like jigsaw puzzle pieces.  He set up a scene, I responded... and then boom, nothing but one liners and requests that I keep writing while his posts amounted to \"I agree\" or \"I wondered what happened next.\"  A variation or two of \"Keep doing that,\" though I'm using more words than he did at the time.\n\nAnd so I told him that he was a great writer but I wasn't feeling it.  And then suddenly he got verbose, telling me how great I was and how much he enjoyed it, and thoughts and ideas he had for our next role play.  Being an idiot, I agreed, and you can bet money on what happened next.  Yeah, the same thing.  So I stopped again.  Now we're in an endless cycle of \"Hey, Emma, want to role play?' followed by \"Sure, you start.  It's your turn.\"  Nothing for a few hours.  \"Hey, want to rp?\"  \"Sure, it's still your turn.  Any time, buddy.\"  A day later: \"Want to continue?!\"  and \"You know I do.  It's still your turn!\"\n\nWell, that's my tale.  Have a good night, fellow Redditors!",

I had set out a forum titled \u201cmagical professor x student\u201d thinking no harm in it. The plot that I had in mind was a grouchy wizard teaching a determined princess  on how to use magic since I thought it\u2019d be cute. There was only a 2 yr age gap between the characters. Suddenly I got a dm accusing me of being a \u201cpedo\u201d when I was literally only 16 years old at the time. I told them to fuck off because I don\u2019t want to explain myself to a rando. But then they and their friends flocked to my dms, calling me a bunch of insults and even went far to sending me gore pics. They even made callout posts about me falsely accusing me for being a creepy adult for preying on children? All because I didn\u2019t want to explain myself. I had to take a break from the internet for a bit, it was getting too heated for me. But when I came back it had appeared that I mass reported and my account was gone. \n\nHonestly, that was the first time I cried over something like rping online. I\u2019m a lot better now but it still kinda haunts me.",

I feel really bad because I have a rp partner who've I had for almost 6 years now, its great! But...frankly i don't think i can do it anymore but it feels like they don't care that i can't? Admittedly i admit I've been a horrible partner I make shallow characters, my replies are slow, i can't ever think of interesting things to add onto dynamics, and my creativity is lackluster. In the past I had a habit of not sharing oc details just...because low self esteem so I only shared when asked, which i understand is super annoying to do especially after reassuring that you are interested and willing to hear.\n\n\nAll things she's voiced by the way, it's not something that's just in my head unfortunately. I honestly wish i could keep going but whenever i sit down to think about ocs and try to make engaging dynamics it's just. Blank, I'm just sitting there stressed because I can't think of anything.\u00a0\n\n\nI aired my concerns to my rp partner and said i need to stop for a while, take a breather from them and come back someday. But her exact words are \"No you won't because I'm getting what I want from our ocs because you promised, or our friendship is over.\" I honestly don't know what to do. Writing has become a job not a hobby but I don't want to lose this friendship especially since we share the same circle. I don't know man. I hate to just give up like this but I've been trying hard the past month and still... it's not good and there's always problems or it just doesn't cater to my partner. She's GREAT at writing honestly she thinks about all the right things, her characters have depth, she creates fun and interesting worlds and I'm honored she wants to write with me but it's also painfully clear she's only doing it because she hates broken promises not because she enjoys rping/creating with me, at least not a majority of the time. I really want the best for her and know I can't give it, it sucks but I know there's people in our circle who mingle better with her and her tastes- heck she's even said it herself i wish they were my partner instead but I'm stuck with you. I dunno man it's just been dragging me down. I don't think I can force myself to try for much longer, but I don't know how to stop without ruining my friendship. I'm as the kids say, going through it. I just wanted to vent a little and hopefully? Get outside opinions on it but don't force yourself to!",

            "selftext": "\\*sigh\\*\n\nAs written in the title, I have been roleplaying for a bit over a decade now. Over 10 years. What started with one-liners and poor English turned out to be a great hobby. But roleplaying is much more than this. It helped me so much in my life: Despite having dyslexia, I managed to get a certificate of advanced English because I have been writing so fricking much. And i helped me cope in hard times, especially during the pandemic.\n\nBut as much fun as I had and as much as I still love to write... it's the people ruining it for me. Recently, I got ghosted by somebody I have written over 155 A4 pages together with. And this certainly was not the first time this is happening. This just hurt so much more than anything else before. Nobody really knows I am writing roleplays because I fear getting laughed at or being ridiculed for it, so there isn't anybody I can really talk about this, so that's why I am dropping this here. \n\nAnyway, as I have just written, I got ghosted many times before. I originally come from a roleplaying forum that went down in flames after some nasty sh\\*t happening and many people left (let's call this event 'revealmaggedon'). I was one of them. But before that, this page was my second home. While everything was going down to rubble in my real life, I had friends (or at least I thought so) on the internet that I could write and chat with and just have a good time, forget all my troubles for a moment before real life called again.\n\nBut over the time it got worse. People simply stopped replying to me, while I saw they were active otherwise and searching for new roleplay partners. I asked them once or twice if everything is okay and if they are still interested in writing with me, but never got an answer. If I messaged people because I found their roleplay ad interesting 90% of the time, I never got a response. \n\nMost of them time, when somebody actually did reach out to me, I tried to be understanding writing things like 'No problem, take your time' or 'Don't worry, get better soon' and stuff like that, I think this was my downfall because people got to know they can to anything with me, and I'll just be like \"yeah okay, no problem. If you need support, I'm here.\"\n\nI also had a few roleplays going over discord at the same time, it was all the same. Somebody promised me a reply one day (what was like... four months ago or something)  and I haven't got anything until today. They constantly apologized to me that life is stressful, but after the billionth month of absence, I just stopped believing them. Just tell me that you won't have time for writing with me anytime soon. \n\nAfter the revealmaggedon I kept three roleplays (all over Google Docs), two people ghosted me (one was the lad mentioned above) and I quit the other because my partner was not writing enough to actually make me write a good reply (I have some self-expectations, and if I can't meet them I lose interest in the RP). After this I moved to reddit and although it has only been a few days I had several messaged not replied to, roleplays already dying because people are simply not responding and not reacting to me messages if everything is fine. I totally understand that things are happening in real life, I totally do, but at least, they can tell me that they're gone for a while. It doesn't even take two minutes to do so. After some bad events in my life, I was gone for a week, but after I was back, I apologized for my absence, explained briefly what was going on, and we were good to go. \n\nI have no idea if I just happen to be so unfortunate to just always find the nasty people who don't care that there is another being sitting behind the screen on the other end or if I am doing something wrong or if this behaviour is just something so common in the roleplay community (don't get me wrong, all you nice rpers out there, I just have made very bad experiences). Anyway, it gives me anxiety to reach out to somebody about a roleplay because I fear they will ghost me sooner or later because that is what has happened to me 99.9% of the time. I don't want to reach out to anyone any more because I know they will leave me one day and leave me with no info about what is going on. I always get so invested in roleplays, putting all my effort in to write in a good quality, make characters that actually make sense and yeah...\n\nAs said, I have no idea if it's my wrongdoing (maybe I am an asshole, I don't know), if it is the community, if it's just people being mean to me for whatever reason and me attracting such personalities or whatever. I am anxious while writing, and I really consider leaving all this behind despite knowing how hard it will be because I just love writing. \n\nSorry this is so long. I just needed to get this out.",

They taught me a lot about what to do and that communicating with one another was really important\u2026it feels like I\u2019ll never be able to find someone like them to roleplay with again.

But now I\u2019m stuck with what to do with my OCs because they were basically made for my partner\u2019s OCs. I love them so much and I would love to write more with them on my own, but I\u2019m not sure how. I don\u2019t want to steal their OCs and pretend they\u2019re my own because they\u2019re not mine. Do I make more OCs to replace theirs? What about the storyline? Should I change that as well or am I allowed to keep it? \n\nI\u2019ve only had one partner so I\u2019m really lost on what to do next. I might be over-thinking things too. But I\u2019d like to post about my OCs on social media and it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me talking about my partner\u2019s characters when they aren\u2019t part of my life anymore.\n\nThank you in advance!",

It\u2019s so frustrating to be planning an RP and you seem to both be super excited for it, you talk for weeks about all the stuff that\u2019s gonna go down, you plot, you share memes with each other that remind you of your characters, all that good stuff\u2026 and then poof, they\u2019re gone.\n\nI wrote a multi-paragraph starter for this RP and my partner loved it, we gushed about how great this RP is gonna be, we talk for a few more weeks and they still have not given a response to the starter. It was fine by me, so long as we still talked OOC. They still seemed plenty interested.\n\nBut then eventually they just\u2026 disappeared. For months. No explanation. Suddenly, they\u2019re back, and they apologize and explain that they were having a horrible mental health episode. I say it\u2019s fine, we continue talking for another few weeks, and STILL no response to the roleplay.\n\nI just\u2026 am not sure what\u2019s going on here? And to make things worse, I saw them post an RP ad that had themes that were exactly like the plot we were gonna have. And I\u2019m confused. They didn\u2019t seem bored or tired of our conversations at all, and gave enthusiastic OOC responses, so\u2026?\n\nIt\u2019s just strange, and frustrating.

            "selftext": "So I just had the most horrific experience with a person partner possible. I genuinely hope he sees this as well.\n\nSo, I put out an ad looking for a partner. In my ad I disclosed that I did not want a smut to be the main focus of our roleplay. I don\u2019t mind smut, I actually love to write it, but I usually disclose this just to keep the weirdos from messaging me. Anyways, I got a few responses, one specifically from this guy who seemed actually seemed up to par with what I was searching for in a partner! We hit it off incredibly well! I won\u2019t discredit his writing ability, he was an amazing writer! But ooc chatter seemed to start getting\u2026. intense.\n\nWe were very open with each other about certain things! Like what our kinks were so we could later use them in our story if we wanted to which I was okay with! So after opening up to one another about or sexual preferences and all that, things took a very quick turn. I mean so fast that so didnt see any of this coming. Our story heavily started to lean towards smut, and that\u2019s okay I guess. I don\u2019t mind erp, I have a lot of wholesome stories going on right now so so guess it was a nice change of pace. It wasn\u2019t until he started asking me about if I get off to the stories I write and all that stuff that it started to get weird. It made me uncomfortable, but it\u2019s not the first time a male writer has asked me such a thing. I don\u2019t like confrontation so I\u2019m usually pretty good about just giggling and moving on with the conversation, whatever. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nFast forward, this person asks me if I have ever been r*p*d. That didn\u2019t throw me off guard, but what threw me off guard was him saying \u201cBut before you answer, if you have, my apologies if it turns me on.\u201d Which made me extremely sick to my stomach and it triggered me a lot. I think he could tell he messed up because I didn\u2019t answer nor speak to him for the rest of the night. I couldn\u2019t look at my discord, I felt so gross. \n\nWhen I finally did look at my discord, he had messaged me a few times asking if he had done something wrong, I expressed to him that what he said made me really uncomfortable and it triggered me a lot. He apologized (which i appreciated) but I wasn\u2019t ready to talk to him right that moment. I needed a bit of space. So I fell asleep that night and when I woke up, I had 23 missed messages from him, profusely apologizing and insisting that I continue our story together. This may sound stupid but I was willing to give this guy another chance!\nSo I told him I accepted his apology and would be able to write a response to our story short but I couldn\u2019t right that moment because I\u2019ve been busy! (Work and birthday stuff.) Real life just gets busy sometimes you know? I even gave him a heads up and told him so wouldn\u2019t be able to respond every day due to this. \n\nNot even 48 hours goes by and I get a message telling me that I better respond by the end of the day or he will be finding someone else to roleplay with.\n\nWhen I tell you my jaw hit the floor. Safe to say I cut ties with him entirely and we are no longer even added on each other\u2019s discord\u2019s. \n\nIt really sucks that a few really pervy male writers ruin it for others! I\u2019ve had so many GREAT male partners, but now i\u2019m just scared to even write with them because of guys like him. Men do better!!! (not all men obviously)",

            "selftext": "So this story is from about 2 years ago? Back when I wrote MxF stories and I wrote with men. Now I've had WAY too many bad experiences with both to feel comfortable doing either. \n\nSo basically this guy and I have this space pirates steampunk sorta vibe. His character is a ship captain, mine is a mechanic who's also a cyborg. Real scrawny, SUPER insecure about her body. I was upfront about how if there was going to be nsfw content, there'd have to be SIGNIFICANT buildup and development to it because my character at the start of the rp was not in any sort of mental state to feel comfortable sleeping with anyone. He says he's totally fine with that. \n\nThen, next reply he mentions his character staring at my character's ass. Sir, she is a scrawny starved mechanic in baggy clothes. There is no ass to be seen. But whatever, so then he sends his character's faceclaim, saying that the photo is the only picture he could find of a character that looks like his... the photo is of pretty much the most stereotypical late 20s white guy with a dark fade haircut. It would take me 5 seconds to google a picture of him, but NO, the reference photo this guy sends is an image of his character naked and graphically fucking this alien girl. It's not even just pornographic, it's hideous. The artist clearly has no clue how anatomy or boob physics work, it just makes me super uncomfortable. \n\nIn his next reply, he basically tells my character to take a shower because she's dirty... because she's a mechanic. It's clearly just his way of wanting me to describe my character getting naked. In hindsight I should've just cut to her fully clothed out of the shower just to spite him, but at the time what I did was I made the reply super angsty and described nothing remotely sexual, it was just all about her being super insecure about her body. \n\nThe next 'reference photo' he sends is of what the ship's AI looks like. The photo is get again graphic phonography of a holographic woman fucking herself on a dildo. But when one looks closer at the photo, there's also porn in the background and several other dildos. But, my personal favorite detail is the Teddy Bear on the bed that inexplicably has abs. Why is there a teddy bear with abs? I don't know, but it haunts my nightmares. \n\nSo at that point I admittedly just ghosted him because I was shy, though today I absolutely would've told him right where he could shove those reference photos. I still have screenshots of them, though they're admittedly jarring so I figured I probably shouldn't attach them to this post lmao",

One of my requests was that you must be a female (trans and nb people are welcome.) \n\nI usually always request this because the last few times I have written with male writers it has always ended up bad. They always find some way to make me really uncomfortable. Asking things like \u201cdo you get off to our smut?\u201d or sending unsolicited photos of their\u2026.do I need to say? I had one male writer get really attached to me in an unhealthy way and would say really frightening things.  I\u2019m not saying all male writers are bad! I\u2019ve just been really nervous to write with male writers as of late. Female writers have always been so kind and understanding and they make me feel really safe. \n\nAfter posting this I got extremely hateful messages, really mean comments on that post, and some of the messages I was receiving weren\u2019t really *mean* but they were definitely upset I didn\u2019t want to give them a shot for being a male writer. \n\nWas I in the wrong to exclude male writers because of past experiences? You can be honest. I also got a message from the mod that said I wasn\u2019t allowed to exclude a group of people because of their gender or race. The race part I totally understand! Good for them for enforcing that! But gender!? Luckily I found other subreddits, but I felt so attacked at the time. Seriously, was I in the wrong?",
