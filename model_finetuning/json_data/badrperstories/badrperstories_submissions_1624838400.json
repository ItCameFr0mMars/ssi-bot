I\u2019m asked her did she have anything happing I\u2019m her personal life and she said no. Im just confused cause she said she was free every day.

            "selftext": "I play as a Herm woman on F-list who is neither gay nor straight but I don't RP with men because my character is mostly attracted to herms, shemales and regular females. So, I have in my kinks \"Gender transformation\" because I enjoy turning women into hyper muscular dickgirls, yeah\n\nMy ad was simple \"Herm is looking for unassuming girls to turn into herm amazons!\" \n\nAnd this dude approaches me, he's got a BDSMtest thingy as his entire profile, compared to me, my art is all commissioned and I have a backstory for my herm lady and everything. Some of it is lewd and I try not to portray my character as a \"shebull\" because that term is CRINGE and I try not to play her as a bully.\n\nAnyways, it's really hard to find a female character that would be into the same stuff I would be into. It's gotten to the point where it's adding insult to injury when guys approach me because I know that they haven't read my profile because I have custom kinks outlining what I'm looking for AS WELL AS FUCKING FILLING OUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR WHICH DOES DETAIL THAT MEN ARE NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR!\n\nSo this idiot approaches me and attempts to skirt around my no men rule by wanting to be turned into a girl.\n\nIdiot messages me. I forget what he said, but I'm so emphatic about not wanting a male partner I'm fuming because of the disrespect he's showing me by just messaging me. (This sounds bad. But people on F-list don't respect boundaries and it makes me angry)\n\nSo I emphasise that I am looking for a girl so I say to him: \"**GIRLS.** Are you a \"Girl\"?\" expecting him to get a clue by stressing that I'm looking to transform women into futas, not males into women.\n\nHe replies with \"K\"\n\nI'm thinking \"I got through to him!\" until  I see...\n\n*Idiot Dudebro is typing...*\n\nSo I just blocked him. He clearly doesn't respect boundaries and one of his custom fetishes are \"Being rude\" and it's basically a complaint about how people don't let him do what he wants to you in exchange for doing something you really like to do or not doing something he likes. So he says your likes/dislikes as an afterthought and I just didn't want anything to do with someone who was bratty and immature.\n\nWhy can't people just fucking understand that I'm not looking to RP with females? I'd move off F-list but Reddit and Tumblr aren't any better. People on Reddit just want to troll people when they're looking to play with people because some parts of reddit are infected with fucking assholes.\n\nI hate enjoying my niche growth fetish because it makes it hard to find partners.",

When they answered they said something like \u201cget prepared for a new clingy best friend.\u201d My thoughts? Ehh- Let\u2019s not think about too much. This is supposed to be a nice rp and I don\u2019t mind a bit OOC. I didn\u2019t want to think about it too much because some people are just generally more open I guess? \n\nSoon we added each other on discord and I wanted to get into the planning for the rp. He sent me a picture of himself right away and I was surprised because technically it\u2019s not a requirement for a rp. While I have switched pictures of each other with other partners in the past because I have gotten a bit more comfortable with them, this was new. I tried to overplay the fact that I was slightly uncomfortable with a text saying: \u201coh I didn\u2019t know we\u2019re doing this already haha\u201d. His explanation was: \u201cOh I just like to know who I am talking to. Feel free to also send me a picture.\u201d My answer was that I would rather not do that and would like to get back to the rp. The next second I was unfriended. Lovely. No but I am actually glad they sort of got rid of themselves so I didn\u2019t have to. And I don\u2019t want to know what else would have happened if it started like this already.",

            "selftext": "So I am 30 and F. I did a little RP on IMVU and discord. I thought it would be a good idea to find a new partner that was male and at least 25. I am also married but my RPs are not sexual. I found a RPer that I thought was a good fit. I reached out and we talked for a few minutes and I asked a question. I asked do the RP ideas he has include sex. He said no. I said great because I\u2019m married. After that, he stopped replying. I thought it was internet issue on my end but I got nothing back from him for a hour. However, I went back to his post and he had replied to someone  else who reached out by commenting. So, I guess marriage disqualifies me from RPing now.",

            "selftext": "... unless one is an arrogant flizzwhacker with delusions of their own adequacy.\n\nI'm pretty active in a space exploration game. Really love it, been playing the thing for five years. Until relatively recently, though, I was more or less a solo player. I encountered a group of other players that had formed sort of a guild. One of the Grand Poo-Bahs was... we will just say problematic.\n\nSee, this is the thing. This guild and many of those in it seem not to understand the division between IC ad OOC. In most of the cases, it's just a little confusing. But in the case of Poo-Bah... great googly-moogly. This person uses the guise of roleplay as an excuse for his behavior OOC.\n\nThis bullmess got started when he abruptly gave me a damn dressing down for dropping advice for one of the players in my direct player group. Because we were on the vessel of someone else, he expected the captain of that ship, my crewmate *and* me to bow down and kiss his ass. Uh... kiiinda not how that shit works, m'dude. If a member from another command were doing something directly dangerous, sure, any officer could slap them down. However, the point that was being made was that my soldier had just been a tad overenthusiastic. One sentence from me would have been all that was needed. \n\nBut noooo. No, I get to endure a wholeass dressing down from someone that *is not involved in my command structure.* I am ex-Navy. In no fucking way would an admiral start raving like a whackjob at a fellow officer in front of people lower in rank. So I decided to ask a favor. I messaged Poo-Bah and said  'Hey, next time I do something you have issues with, could you pretty please just grab me in DMs so we can talk about it there?' Literally in those words, super polite.\n\nNope.\n\nThis human ass-disaster went ballistic. Started bellowing at me about 'NOT EVERYTHING I DO IN RP IS AN ATTACK, PYTHIA!!!1!!ONE!!!1!' and just... going off. He made this shit out to be me being totally unreasonable. He expected me to just sit and allow him to deluge me with a particularly shocking diatribe. Most people would be smart. Most people would just go 'Dude. The vein that's pulsing on your forehead is not a cute look. You need to chill before you have an aneurism,' and then yeet.\n\nNot me, man. I often try so hard to believe that there's good in everyone.\n\nSee, Poo-Bah had had some crap go down with another player, someone for whom I had bought the game. He really got hurt by this person, and I feel kind of bad about it. So I put up with this bullmess. There were a couple other examples of him being rude or downright abusive. One thing he does that drives me completely bugshit... have you ever...\n\nHAD A CONVERSATION  \nWith someone WHO  \nTYPES LIKE THIS  \nFor like twenty lines  \nAND THEN  \nexpects YOU to  \nfollow THEIR BULLMESS?\n\nLike dude. I have shit with my eyes that makes it hard to follow this kind of crapflood really difficult. For the love of Gods, please give me paragraphs over that 'combat typing' crap. I asked him to not do it, because I legit have issues reading it. The response? 'NO, PYTHIA, that's an excuse!!!' If it had been a workplace, he would have needed to know the term 'reasonable accommodation'. I can't resolve an issue *if I can't read what you are typing and keep missing things.*\n\nLet me remind you, Gentle Reader... that all this while, he is blurring the IC/OOC line to where I can't tell whether the player or the character is the one being pissy. So, there were a bunch of situations where he blew his O ring at me. A lot of them I just couldn't tell whether I was talking to Poo-Bah or his character. I would pull back from an argument and go 'grey rock' and try to just work around him. But if I so much as posted a gods-damned song or screenshot from the game, I would get castigated.\n\nSo I left that server, only to have him @ me in another. Huge argument there, too, so I left *that* server, too. Literally nothing I did or said was fucking good enough, short of me groveling. I am a RL wartime veteran. *I do not fucking grovel.* To anyone. Ever. \n\nEnd game for me being in this group came a couple of days ago. The same young officer did something... kiiiinda maybe not excellent. Sort of 'wrong action, right motivation'. He was trying to protect me from Poo-Bah and used way the wrong tactic, but we resolved it after a long discussion. I issued consequences that he could tolerate, issue solved. Some of it meant I needed to tell Poo-Bah what the resolution was. \n\nAaaand he lost his shit.\n\nThing about me? I *detest* trying to solve conflict in a scenario where there are a bunch of people I don't knows, munching popcorn and probably taking screenshots that may or may not get traded around like baseball cards. (Screenshot culture is *cancer.* Change my mind.) I asked, then pleaded and then raged that we resolve this whole shit in private. Nope. Last year, I had a very, very serious incident with cyberharassment. It messed with my head in all kinds of ugly ways, and he knows about this. I've always been a bit more socially sensitive than some people, and what happened last year made that worse. But, NO PYTHIA, YOU CAN'T DO THIS IN PRIVATE!!!11!!one!!!!1!\n\nI did my best. I tried to be kind, reasonable use Dialectical Behavior Therapy's 'middle path' and 'radical acceptance'. Nothing worked. I ended up leaving yet a third server because of this mook. I made it clear I was leaving the wholeass organization and actually feel a lot better since returning to being indie.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDon't blur IC and OOC, most especially if you lead a guild. Also, don't act like a three-legged llama smoking crystal meth when someone tries to resolve a conflict. Upper echelon should behave to higher standards.  \n\n\nPS: the guy who harassed me? It happened over a misunderstanding. We fixed it and are now very good friends. If we can do that, so could Poo-Bah.",

It may have been under a different account, different name, been on kik, discord, reddit,I don't entirely remember, but I just wanted to use this platform, especially after reading through posts on this subreddit and being disgusted with myself because I could see people talking about bad things other people did, that I've done myself, which made me feel horrible.\n\nI was a stupid kid, who didn't know any better, and I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart. I have no idea if those people will ever even see this, but I just wanted to put it out there for everyone to see. I started off terribly, but, growing up with RP'ing, finding genuinely nice, and real people to help me improve along the way, I can say now, that I've gotten much better, and I can honestly say, sitting here as a currently 25 year old, that I am in a much better place personally and professionally because of the kindness of people like the ones I've seen on this subreddit. So for that, I truly am eternally grateful.\n\nSo, I just wanted to leave this here, as some closure, I apologise deeply for what I have done, and the only thing I can think to do, is try to continue along the path of postivity, and be better than that. \ud83d\ude4f",

            "selftext": "Honestly, I'm a little flattered that this person, or these people, are so obsessed that months later they're still popping up.   \n\n\nJust a fair warning apart from this being really long, it's mostly a lot of OOC drama mixed with my IRL relationship with my boyfriend. I know some people feel a type of way about dating your RP partners. We didn't plan this out, it just sort of happened. \n\nI was concerned at first, when I wasn't sure what these people could do or what they would try to do to myself and my writing partner, who also happens to be an IRL SO.  \n\n\nSo for some context, I run a server on Discord. It's small, but we've been going for 3.5 years now with a steadily growing group of truly amazing and wonderful writers. Through that server, I met my now boyfriend. We were together for 2 years with him working as an Admin with me and one other in the server, and that honestly strained so much of our relationship. It's really hard to maintain a romantic relationship where you're equal partners with someone who technically works under you. So eventually, we started having problems with our communication.   \n\n\nUnbeknownst to me, he went looking for another server to join as a vacation place from me. Around that time, I'd also suffered a huge loss IRL with a miscarriage and my method of self-sabotage is isolation, so I cut him out of my life and got really cold with him on the staff. In short, I get why he did what he did, even though we had a rule in our relationship not to join servers without one another.   \n\n\nAround summer 2020, I noticed something was off and one day asked him outright if he was in other servers. He lashed out that I had no right to ask him that, but he eventually did verify that he had. Something still felt off though.   \n\n\nAround November, we decided to take some time off our romantic relationship because it was to a point where we were fighting every single day to the point that we both were in tears and having panic attacks. It was brutal and deeply unhealthy. I still viewed us as being together but just taking a mental health break, while he viewed us as fully broken up.   \n\n\n In February, we got a player in and he warned me about her, saying she was in the other server he was in and had gotten banned because she was such a nut case. She ended up leaving and indeed being very toxic, not to mention kind of full of herself. She had done less than one scene with us, and then in DMs told me \"I'm sure a lot of people noticed me leaving and will probably leave too.\" Out of our whole player base, maybe two people noticed she had left and both of them specifically said they were glad because she made everyone so uncomfortable. You know those types that somehow turn EVERY conversation into something about them and how bad they have it? She was one of those.   \n\n\nHowever, in early March, she came back. One night, after bf went to sleep, I got a wild thought and messaged her to ask about the server he had told me she was kicked from. She told me the name of it, so I looked it up and I think what I was most heart broken about was the fact that he was playing a PB I had picked specifically because it's my personal favourite, with a character that was initially hand-crafted by bf to be played with me. I remember shaking just from that betrayal, which is probably really dumb. This girl then caught on to something I had said, where I was quoting something bf said. She started showing me screen shots of a conversation with her best friend, where this new girl was talking about *her boyfriend* who was actually my boyfriend, knowing that he was dating someone else and willingly letting him cheat on that other girlfriend with me. The screen shots showed her talking about how much they loved each other OOC and how much my bf hated me but was too afraid to leave me.   \n\n\nSo I made it easy for him. I kicked him from my server, left our private server, blocked and deleted him everywhere. I went to sleep that night shaking, and for a month after, I stopped eating.   \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nOkay so now that we have the context out of the way, BF and I have a happy ending. It was about 2 weeks after that, that I reached out via text and apologized for my part in everything. We started talking again the next day, first just as friends, but soon we were back together which is where we are now.   \n\n\nHe was still in that other girl's server though, and she still very obviously felt like he was hers. I knew that if he left her, it needed to be on his own, that if I pressured him at all he might grow to resent me. So what's funny here is that while she turned into a crazy person overnight when she discovered we were talking again, and while she was still CONSTANTLY talking shit about me and trying to convince him to leave me, I was talking to him and helping him understand her emotions so they could actually work things out. Because I definitely know what it's like to love him and feel threatened by others in just RP spaces, despite knowing our relationship IRL is stronger than it's ever been.   \n\n\nAll she had to do was not be a psychopath. And she couldn't. She began spiraling almost immediately and then lashing out at him. I got to see the screen shots and some of the things she said to him were the sort of things my addict friends say when they fall off the wagon. It was very clear she was having a series of manic episodes. I wanted to reach out to let her know I was genuinely not a threat to her. That despite him and I being back together, he was not coming back to my server and I had no intention of making him leave hers. She really had nothing to worry about from me. But my bf insisted that that would only make her worse, so I stayed away.   \n\n\nEventually this weird mini-feud started between her and the friend that had told me everything, where they went back and forth doxxing one another to hub server owners, so either was getting banned from advertising their own spaces at any given time. It felt very much like middle school drama, but both of these women were in their very early 20s, so I have to assume they'll grow out of it.   \n\n\nThe former \"gf\" turned out to just be someone my bf liked flirting with online, but they weren't close the way he and I were. Evidently, that was the worst part for her. Toward the end of her spiral, she told him she was going to take some time away and gave him her phone number. He told her he wasn't going to use it because he didn't feel comfortable with that. She disappeared, and he assumed it was her taking time away.   \n\n\nHe stepped up as SiC of her server to keep it running smoothly for her. Then a week out. I get a weird new alias in my server who comes in and makes some very strange comments. Within an hour, my bf tells me another mod in their server reported that Former GF told her she had been in a car accident, where her car had flipped 12 times, but she had just been released from the hospital. It sounded really sus, so I told him \"Imo, I wouldn't believe that until I saw the accident report. Maybe a hospital selfie.\" It just seemed like convenient timing. Also worth noting was that the mod-friend specifically said \"don't say anything. I feel like she doesn't want people to know.\" I grew up with a really manipulative sister who pulled stuff like this a lot though, so to me it seemed more like Former reached out to her friend and pretended like she didn't want the attention, knowing it would get back to my bf.   \n\n\nI had a hunch, so later that night I posted in my own server a question to the tune of \"if you had a really manipulative friend who kept lying and escalating for attention, would discovering that they lied about nearly dying in a car crash be last-straw worthy to you?\" It sparked a conversation among my players about some of the details I'd gotten second-hand and how obviously a lie the story was.   \n\n\nAnd as fate would have it, the next day, Former's story had changed. She hadn't flipped so many times and now she had a \"major concussion\" instead of just a minor one, and she was being admitted again to the hospital, after apparently being let go with only minimal injuries before. The sus grew.   \n\n\nEventually, my bf gave me this girls IRL name and I ran a background check on her. I found an accident report that was fairly recent. It was barely a fender bender. Screen shot that to my bf, who had yet to get any proof from this girl. Seemed like I was right. After my little experiment in my own server, I kicked out the weird user that had joined just to lurk.   \n\n\nAfter about a month of my bf running this girl's server for her, she comes back to light into him about how he had her phone number and hadn't called or text her once to see how she was and that that was proof he didn't care about her. He reiterated that he had told her he wasn't comfortable with that. She just kept insisting. Another fight happened. At this point, he didn't want to be with her anymore. I was willing to share, I'm married and poly IRL so I'm familiar enough with these dynamics. But she had been beating him over the head with emotions since finding out he and I were talking again. I know this because I saw the screen shots. I know my bf can skew the truth when he's venting, but these screen shots were very obviously abusive.   \n\n\nShe blocked him and then started making comments in their staff channel that were really passive aggressive. I saw those screen shots too. Then about a week out, she messaged him saying she couldn't do it anymore and asked if he wanted to take over the server for her. He said yes. She lit into him about how she had known all along that he was using her and his closeness with her just to take control of her server away. Potentially important to note here is that it's not even her server. It was started by someone else who then passed it over to her, so by now it has a history of changing owners based on who has the most time and availability. Either way, it was a bullshit tactic to try and trap him. He decided that day that he was going to leave. It was just too much.   \n\n\nThen he started getting screen shots from the mod-friend showing Former threatening to dox him to their server of roughly 100+ people. Kind of insane.   \n\n\nFinally, about a week after that, she had blocked him and then unblocked him to tell him that from now on he needed to report everything he did back to her. She also demoted him from Admin to Mod. Instead of responding, he just reacted to the message with a thumbs up. A few minutes later, she asks \"what so we're not talk anymore?\" As if she hadn't had him blocked for the last week. This was where he told her he was going to leave and offered to stay on for a few more weeks to train a replacement and wrap up his character stories so other players wouldn't be left with their stories unfinished. She refused and then asked if he wanted to keep in touch. He said he would be happy to offer server support from the outside but couldn't see a need to talk beyond that. She didn't like that much, so he left and they haven't spoken since.   \n\n\nWithin a day of him leaving, her two other highest level mods also left because she'd been similarly abusive to them as well. We got reports that she did, in fact, dox my boyfriend and the other mod friend to the server. The other two mods opened up a similar concept story and something like 20 people left the original for theirs.   \n\n\nAfter that, it was a few months of silence. BF and I are doing amazing and we're working on concept servers that are mostly just exercises in our ability to work together rather than me being his manager, because that was so unhealthy for us. We chat on the phone once per week, we talk almost all day every day, we're planning a trip together. Both our families know about each other. It's been really amazing. And best of all is that this whack job has been out of our lives.   \n\n\nFast forward two months. Former starts messaging mod-friend again, who reports back to my bf, that she's saying all this stuff about \"why did you betray me? I can't believe you'd do this to me.\" Just guilt trip upon guilt trip. Mind you, not only did this girl dox her alleged two closest friends. She also insulted them, belittled them, and verbally attacked them almost daily toward the end. What she views as a betrayal is literally just a group of people prioritizing their mental health and happiness to remove themselves from a toxic situation. I heard about these messages *yesterday*.   \n\n\nThen I woke up to seeing two very suspicious accounts that had come into and then left the server around 1 in the morning. The first was \"\\[Name\\] Probably\" with that Name being the name of the friend that first showed me all those screenshots. The second account was a that girl's username + my username. Both stayed for about 3 minutes each and then left. My staff is aware of both of these girls, the other friend ended up being a bit of basket case herself and she started a lot of drama in my server. Both have standing bans.  \n\n\nBut honestly, it seems more likely that it's Former making fake accounts to see if my BF's back in my server now that she's getting active again. The other girl doesn't have a reason to check back with me. So as far as I'm concerned, it's Former trying to be sneaky (and failing masterfully) by implying she's the other girl while spying on my server.   \n\n\nThroughout today, BF and I are hearing more about this girl, Former, seeming like she's spiraling again and going a little nuts that she can't find a server my BF's in so she can talk to him again.   \n\n\nAnyway, if anyone's diggity down for 80s Neon Noir type stories or Shakespearean historical-fiction, our two project servers are set to launch in November - hit me up? We do require all parties be 25+ to avoid this type of drama. It's been...kind of a lot.",

Crickets. Maybe a few responses are exchanged, it's going well and then the responses start becoming few and far between. Then it becomes a deafening silence. The server is a ghost town.

The one who hogs all the interesting plot lines, the one who always have to be right, the ones who always have be favored or the entire roleplay goes to hell? \n\nI have a roleplay buddy who NEEDS to be better than mine. Her oc directly admitted it to mine. She never wants her to be good at something UNLESS her oc is better. She never wants her character to be called out &amp; if she is she will have her oc lose her goddamn mind &amp; KILL PEOPLE! SERIOUSLY? THIS WAS A SCHOOL ROLEPLAY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? \n\nEvery love interest? Hers. Other characters as a friend? Hers. Who's the one always in the right? Her. Who's the one who everyone sides with? Her. Who's the only person in the world with issues so everyone coddles them? Her! My oc has only 2 canon friends interacting with her in that roleplay &amp; her one love interest WAS FUCKED BY MY RP BUDDIES OC BEFOREHAND TOO! Their relationship is so toxic because she has my ocs LI defending her oc all because they had sex like what, 4 times? &amp; For some reason her friends side with her oc. \n\nI remember her oc STOLE A DRESS ON MY OCS BIRTHDAY &amp; everyone sides with her oc because....she has a rough life &amp; hasn't had a birthday party? So now she can ruin my ocs? She can't take any critique on her characters &amp; antagonizes mine constantly (if you want scenarios so in the comments &amp; I'll give you some if you want a type of situation I'll tell you.) Not to mention she always sexualizes &amp; harasses my ocs for more love interests. She is obsessed with having a harem of boys, FOCUS ON THE DAMN PLOT LINE LADY!",

            "selftext": "Huge trigger warning for those uncomfortable with mentions of suicide and self harm.\n\nThis story is... probably about 4 years old? It was wayyy back when I still wrote on Kik. I started writing with someone, don't remember how I found him or what the roleplay was about, but you know those people who like, from the first 3 DMs you just KNOW it isn't going to work out? He didn't do anything wrong immediately, it was just the vibes, y'know?\n\nSo anyway, we plot out an rp, I write the starter, and my replies were a whole lot shorter than they are today but I've never been a one-liner sorta person, so my reply was close to the message character limit for Kik... at least 2 paragraphs I wanna say. Not sure haha. Anyway, adv lit style, multipara, you get the drill. \n\nHe not only replies with a oneliner, but the sort of oneliner that has asterisks in it. His reply was poorly written in every way it could be for such a small reply. It was maybe like, 10 words AT MOST. I don't remember bc it's been 4 years but it was tiny. No hate to people who prefer to write like that, do what makes you happy, but shit like this is why you're upfront about your average reply length. Not that people actually read my ad all the way through these days and pay attention to that part \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnyway, so I politely tell him \"Hey, I don't think this is going to work out.\"\nThis guy, I shit you not, responds with not only telling me to k*ll myself, but sending detailed and graphic instructions, reference images, and diagrams on the correct way to slit my wrists. I'm talking SEVERAL instructional diagrams on how to bleed out the quickest and graphic images of people with openly bleeding self-harm wounds on their forearms. \n\nI have pretty thick skin so it didn't really trigger me, I was just absolutely baffled. Like dude??? Why would you think that's okay??? What if I was someone who would get triggered by that???\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that he must've been a troll who thinks rp is gross and weird and doesn't understand the concept of \"if it isn't hurting anyone, what consenting people do to make themselves happy in private is none of your business\" that makes it sound like it's an erp... it wasn't lol, I'm just talking about rp in general.

            "selftext": "A small small rant of something that happened so long long ago when kik was popular and wasn't just ad space. \n\nI went on a hunt for a couple of rp peeps who were interested in joining a group rp for a person I was simping for at the time (I say simping because I ignored the red flags at the time ). That's when I landed into a group chat consisting of only three people (I think) and was given an opening line of what the surrounding area is . My character walks about curious as to what timeline she has found herself on when one for her hops on in. Scaring her in a comedic way and another one hoping in with there character giving a rather smug remark towards the situation before introducing themselves all gentleman like.\n\nI actually really liked there responses and I thought \"awesome I found two peeps who would be an amazing add on to the roleplay, let's see how the third one is !\"\n\nThen that's when I was hit with the following response right after my character seems to react positively to there intereactions.\n\n\"*appears shoots her in the head* oops haha!\"\n\nCool, my character hasn't existed for over 5 seconds and is already shot dead. The same person then responding with .\n\n(K you can leave now bye bye!)\n\nAnd I'm like \n\n(You can't just kill a character without asking, what's the point of having an open group chat that anyone can join if your just going to kill off people then kick them out.) \n\nTo which they just say \n\n(go cry about it somewhere else)\n\nI was extremely baffled by what just happened especially since the other two seemed very into the roleplay we were having then suddenly my character gets shot and they grow silent. I left the group and went off searching for another group rp, one of them did pm me asking if I would come back because they actually liked the small rp and I said \" no I'm sorry I don't want to be in a group chat where I get killed and told to leave afterwards\"\n\nAt the time maybe I was overreacting (in my eyes maybe I did) or maybe I should of just done the whole *dodges and teleports behind you* to be an ass I dunno but after that I started to notice and interesting pattern where all it takes is one person to come along and ruin it for everyone else.\n\nI like think that this was the small pebble that lead to a Boulder crushing my creative garden because everything after that has just been awful experiences with other groups.",

            "selftext": " So a few years ago (3 or 4) I stumbled upon an ad for a \"larger\" RP server on discord. Before this, I had only ever done small groups with my friends and 1\u00d71's. It seemed okay at first, everyone seemed welcoming and helpful.\n\nNow a little background, the server didn't have just one set story going on. You could do 1x1's or group rps, it just depended on what you were itching for. That's what drew me to the server initially, I liked being able to do different stories within one space.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first inquired about it they asked if I was over 18, which I was. I was asked for proof which I was hesitant about but provided it with all personal info (except my DOB blacked out). I was assured this was just a security measure and everyone had to do it.\u00a0\n\nWell turns out that wasn't even remotely true. The owner announced that anyone underage needed to message her so we wouldn't get in trouble with TOS since ERP was going on. A few people messaged her, even one that she told us she knew for YEARS and had done many ERP scenes with them. They were 16\u2026. She was in her mid-20s, I think. That honestly should have been the first clue that this group wasn't for me at all.\u00a0\n\nThankfully I never interacted with any of the underage members, I was still getting a feel for the group and hadn't even started any scenes yet. Though it made me a bit paranoid. Anyway, the owner reluctantly kicked out the underage members and we continued. Until one of the underage members came back on a different account and everyone seemed okay with it?\u00a0\n\nThere were rules like any other server. But some just seemed odd?\u00a0\n\n1. No first-person pov. She claimed it triggered her from her AOL RP days. I don't know how a POV can do that but, whatever, I used third person anyway so it didn't matter.\u00a0\n\n2. No shipping characters. It was supposed to stop drama which was understandable. BUT.. She constantly kept scenes going on with characters not letting them interact with others. When they finally did get away and were able to interact with other characters, specifically of the female nature, she got mad.\u00a0\n\nThen everything went downhill fast. She decided to create an actual large group RP with a storyline. It didn't appeal to me but I was assured that we could still do our own thing and wouldn't have to participate in it. That turned out to be an outright lie. A few days later she deleted all other roleplays going on 1\u00d71's and groups without notice. Everyone got a PM stating that we needed to participate in the new story or be banned.\u00a0\n\nI just wished her well and left the group. For weeks after I had her lackeys messaging me saying I was rude for leaving because \"this was her life's work!\" Gag.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFrom what I discovered the group didn't last long after that only 4 out of the 20+ people we had stayed. Sometimes I do wonder what happened to all of them.\u00a0",

That was when I first started RP'ing, six years ago. Then, after a while, some of my RP partners started cutting off RPs early- no harm no foul, y'know- just people not having the energy for it. But I've noticed a change since I started RP'ing six years back.\n\nThese days, I lose energy for an RP, for a character, usually within a *week* of starting an RP, if not **sooner**. I hate myself for it, and I *hate* telling new partners 'I've run out of energy', because I remember getting those same messages when I was younger and being a bit sad that an RP was over (but moving on all the same, I just don't like doing it to others). I **want** to do longer RPs, I *miss* doing longer RPs, but-- no matter what character I play, no matter what fandom or genre I try, I keep finding myself running out *really* fast.\n\n~~There's also the matter that I usually have 13 RPs or so going at any given time which might play into that, so that's a thought.~~\n\nI just-- wish I would *stop losing energy* for RPs. I **hate** losing energy for RPs, and it makes me feel like a complete ass when I do!... Doesn't matter that the RP has become more work than fun for me, I know it's probably still fun for my partner, which makes me despise having to tell them that I will be dropping the RP.\n\nI wish I could go back to those six-month-long RPs, but... I just... I don't know. Is something wrong with me? Have I just been conditioned to always cut it off early? Or is it because I started RP'ing in highschool, and now I'm in college? Or maybe the fact that I have too many RPs going on a daily basis as is???? I don't know.\n\n*I want to enjoy those long-term RPs again, but it's so hard to stay attached to an RP when it keeps getting ripped up so early on.*\n\nI don't even feel anything anymore when someone else asks to end an RP prematurely. I wonder if I've grown detached or something from the whole process..\n\nAhg.\n\nAnyway, ya'll have a good morning/afternoon/day/evening/night. I hope you enjoy your RPs to the fullest (whatever that looks like for ya)!\n\n*Maybe I should start putting out ads for shorter RPs or something...*",

My friend, I guess just found a roleplay partner and one day me and her were talking about doing a group Rp. She wanted to invite him because I guess he was her favorite and she was explaining to me how she was going to be his partner no matter what because he wants someone who\u2019s literate and someone who can write big paragraphs (it often feels like she\u2019s bragging about how she can be more literate but that\u2019s not the isssue rn lol) she had also told me he got jealous when she suggested other partners. I told her that was a bit weird and it seemed possessive. She said it was fine and that she didn\u2019t mind it.\n\nBefore this incident she texted me and told me the guy had asked if she was into CNC but ended up \u2018r^^ing\u2019 her character. I told her if she was uncomfortable no matter how good it is say something. CNC = giving consent before hand and I guess her character did not so it was r**e? She then later told me his character \u2018changed his mind and didn\u2019t go through with it.\n\nIdk he seems okay but like that behavior is weird in my opinion??? He was also being very dominant OOC and she was just letting it happen. I understand that this isn\u2019t my roleplay or my partner but it was weird to hear about.\n\nDoes he seem possessive? Is he giving you guys red flags as well?",

Makes me feel bad, because I feel stupid asking a question like that on discord, just forces me to ghost them. I do not like that, it's rude, and mean.

            "selftext": "Rant ahead. \n\nThe server had decent lore, a story that allows for some room for creativity that I liked. Prefer servers that are semi-story and open world.  And the server was from practice level all the way to advance lit. My character was a girl born without magic. In the lore, people who didn't have their magic awakened or granted were run over by the community. This caused her family to have an inferior complex that passed onto my character, which she shows to have self-esteem issues. She gets attacked by an unknown group of people and was saved by a magical pendant that would allow her to use that as a catalyst for being able to use magic. I was hoping in rp interactions to come to terms with her imposter syndrome from receiving this pendant and accept it as her powers. I was very happy knowing a group of people liked my oc and I was more hopeful this time of finding quality rp partners.\n\nI noticed the server had NSFW/ERP channels that were omitted from the server ads. To make matters more questionable, there wasn't an age limit on the server, nor there were any age identification requirements to get the ERP and NSFW roles so it was available to everyone. Today I saw at least two minors in the server that had the ERP/NSFW roles. Thank God the mods removed their roles asap but that's irresponsible to let those roles be available for anyone to grab. Some people on the server have a maturity level compared to a middle schooler (from spamming memes in a vent channel) so I\u2019m confident a handful of people lied about their age.\n\nNow onto the ocs\u2026oh Jesus.\n\nI read one character sheet that\u2019s goes like this: (this is redacted)\n\nName: Tia\nAge: 18\nGender: Female\nOccupation: Emotional support waifu\n\n\u2026The owner proceeds to accept it a minute later the cs was posted, almost as if they didn\u2019t bother to read and went \u201cfuck it, go have fun rping\u201d. Some of these characters only have one weakness or a fake one like \u201cneeds food or will die\u201d so that their characters don\u2019t actually have one. Most of the backstories are bare bones in the disguise that they will \u201cdevelop\u201d their characters IRP (which they don\u2019t, all they do is fluff and casual rps). My biggest pet peeve is rping with a personality chameleon. Not to be confused with the disorder but meaning that their character\u2019s personalities described are so conflicting and never consistent that it\u2019s so difficult to grasp their actual personality. \n\nFor example, The person who I\u2019m currently rping with is described to be a calm, kind  person and has a strong sense of justice. But then the next line you see that they can \u201cact like an edgy teenager\u201d...WHICH ONE IS IT?? Then when it gets to the rp this \u201ccalm\u201d demeanor is nowhere to be found but most of the time is him freaking out from his \u201challucinations\u201d (which they don't explain why he does in the story or even mention it at all) half the time the character is yelling and every line consist of him self doubting himself out loud. Oh and this guy\u2019s character is trying to become a knight but they have a short attention span and will forget most stuff people will tell him. My character is trying to tell him he should be more attentive because the knight training may/will be tough and he will need to listen to the instructors. But then he's like (redacted and summarized) \n\n\u201cUhh uh..what was your name again? Ah DAMMIT, I'm so stupid I can't remember!! Oh look I hear an animal in the distance!\u201d \n\nAt first, I thought this was a comedic scene here so I played it off like that until the guy keeps doing this 10 rp interactions more. I can't tell if the person I'm rping with is taking this serious or not..or anyone in the server that is. Majority of people in the server are shitposting in the rp request channel and create these joke oc characters like \u201cMonke king\u201d, \u201cLikmiposi Ase\u201d, and they all get accepted. Like where are the standards? Is there any in the rp server? This server has potential but I'm just disappointed in the low-effort, troll character sheets, and the questionable rules of the server.",

            "selftext": "This post is about:  \nWhatsApp RP group, medieval fantasy, leveling system.  \nI joined this one mid-March, after taking a break from roleplaying. I've been invited by a friend. Furthermore, I'd like to vent and tell you guys my experience, for how long I've been in this group? Around three months.\n\nLet's get started.  \n\n\n **#1**. **Don\u2019t stick to just a certain group of contacts.**  \n This is a habit of mine; I stick to the ones I get along better. At first, I observe their attitudes on the group chat and species chat, their writing styles on their posts, with this I can get a notion of whom I\u2019d feel more comfortable having as a writing partner. Their behavior in the group chat can give hints of how their mentality work, and also red flags that I wish I didn\u2019t ignore.  \n \n\n**#2. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, don\u2019t take things too seriously!\u201d**  \n Lies. Some abuse this one to do whatever they want and get away with this, no matter how many times you tell them to stop, talk politely that you don\u2019t see any fun in this, ask them to leave you alone. It\u2019s an excuse to pick on you and treat it like you don\u2019t matter at all. A nasty move, why they get away? Somebody got their backs and sugarcoat it, making you the annoying one.  \n    \n**#3. They pay too much attention to you.**  \n It started getting worse month after month. At first, they focused on my character, her appearance, relationships, how she interacts with people of her kind and members from other kind, weapons of choice and so on.  Then, to me, the player: My writing partners, my writing and gaming style, it was too annoying as if I **had to** follow what they wanted, very forceful and lacking sense of respect.   \n\n\n **#4. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.**  \n A certain player gossips about everyone, mocks other players writing, acts like she\u2019s a better player than everyone else, treats some in a very rude manner, gets angry when someone role plays with her partner(s), but, demands respect when the same thing happens to her.  Hypocrisy at its finest.    \nShe has a status of privilege in the group, proven so many times, but, the Admins just brush it off.",

I always have because I've been on the opposite side where people go MIA and I'm kinda sad and confused. \n\nThis weekend was horrible for me, I got sick, had to work, went to the ER and still had to see family and friends for a party. I was so blindsided by being sick I wasn't able to warn my RP partner I wouldn't be answering for a while. It was 2 days. I text them today saying \"I'm sorry its been a very busy bad weekend.\" And this man hits me with we should stop this rp because it seems I have no time for it and an \"uwu I was busy\" isn't going to fix it. \n\nI explained hey man I was in the ER, had to work and got blind sided by so much stuff. And he told me. \"he should have been someone I told when I was in the er so he knew I'd be gone.\" I thought j was going to have surgery. I was barely able to call my mother and he got mad because I said he was not my #1 priority. He kept saying I have no manners and  clearly have no courtesy if I couldn't even text him. And how I just expected him to know all this. I never once said that and I thought j was going to have to get something g REMOVED FROM MY BODY at the ER. And he is mad I \"clearly have no time for this RP and I should have told him what was going on because it's basic manners.\" \n\nI've been role-playing with this dude less then a month and I feel like he wants all my IRL details when he LITERALLY WENT MIA ON ME FOR A WEEK! and I never asked him anything. Just if he was okay and he said his phone broke. So I get chewed out for being sick and having a life but its okay for him to do it?",

I mostly roleplay on discord and I understand a lot of minors like to get into that nitty-gritty stuff. I used to be one until I found out it was wrong.\n\nBut, I want to learn from my mistakes and know people can lie about their age. I've been asking people only for their age and after finding out a friend I knew for four years turned out to be underage I started to rethink only asking for age. \n\nSo, now I started asking for people's Ids to show me their above the age of 18+ I don't much ERP anymore but I still enjoy having roleplay partners that are adults. After I started to an ad for id most of my roleplay partners straight-up blocked me or good me they're were uncomfortable with giving me an ID. I asked why and they told me even if they block it out there would be some way to see through the blacked-out areas. So, I'm asking Is there any other way than an ID to verify the age of my roleplay partner? I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with roleplaying with a minor.\n\nThank you for reading if you have any advice I would love to read it!",

I generally want to achieve fairness and consideration for anyone that I deal with, but I really have no one I am comfortable to bring this up with OOC so wanted to ask anomalously if perhaps I am just too ready to start a fight if I feel wronged, or if I really just feel as unlucky at times as I do trying to navigate the interpersonal relationships of the conan exiles RP community.",

I have self diagnose myself as a masochist and decided to stay and see how it is because I'm planning on an in-depth review of the server. \n\nNow I had another rp interaction. Was a person who was super persistent in finding a partner. Since my characters were free I accepted their rp request. This was with my female oc. She was in the woods practicing with her powers and while using it had created a pillar of light to grab the other person\u2019s attention. The other person, who I will call Chad had their character appear. They were investigating the light and they saw my character and the whole rp interaction can be summed up to: \n\n\u201cYou, a small lady, did that pillar of light? Can't believe it, my men would laugh if I explain someone like you did it.\u201d\n\nMy character uses a halberd as a weapon. Chad proceeds to say \u201cthat's a pretty flimsy weapon. *A halberd weapon gets called flimsy*. Then the guy proceeds to show off a big metal sword. Put extra detail into describing how heavy it is when my character\u2019s weapon weighs 300 pounds but to her it feels like she's lifting a feather because of her powers as she can pick up stuff that's around 500 pounds.\n\nThe whole rp interaction felt like a dick measuring competition\u2026with a FEMALE. The person I rp with even sent a picture of what the guy looks like mid rp and specified the character\u2019s height and build. They said, \u201ches 7\u20193, good luck\u201d like okay? I make sure to look at character sheets in advance, if you're showing me something don't send it mid rp. Also what happened during rping, another person had pinged to find someone to rp with. Chad instantly responded to their request by saying they will rp with them when they are done rping with me (they only had one character). So now thanks to that I had to rush and end the rp interaction so I don't keep them waiting. I not sure why they couldn't wait at least 30 seconds for something to reply to them. \n\nBut I'm glad the rp interaction ended. If there's an obligatory rp tournament arc, best believe I'm entering in my character and beating down theirs because I absolutely cannot stand when people create show-off characters that only exist to boast how amazing and strong their character is with no depth to them.",
