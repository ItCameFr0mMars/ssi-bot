            "selftext": "Hello all, this is once again another continuation of the last post https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/oci3vp/the_rp_server_with_0_quality_control_the_showoff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nThis will be a much longer post and you will see why once you read it down. \n\nAlright so another day in the rp server. I was exploring different things in their to build up my review. While that was happening I decided to rp with my male oc. This oc was more on the lawful evil side, my plan was to make him indirectly expose the flaws in the kingdom and put it into a position where criminals would flood in and take advantage of the internal chaos. This sounds a lot so when a event would be in the works, I would\u2019ve asked the owners if they agreed with this idea. But for now he\u2019s playing off being your calm, cool, collected knight who doesn\u2019t follow the knightish tradition. \n\nThe other person, I\u2019ll call Mary, I rped with played an orc lady. Just like the giant, they specified way too much on their height, build, etc. Like what\u2019s with people doing this?? Do they feel some type of superiority being an inch or 10 feet giant compared to other characters? I digress. So they met in the tavern, orc lady calls him over, they talked etc. OOC my rp partner and I agreed to have them meet and talk in the tavern first, then my oc would show their oc the castle he works in. Kinda like a tour. They agreed and that\u2019s what our interactions had led up to, or so I thought. \n\nSo at the time of our next interaction I had did my post and we had a thing where we would let each other know that we were done with the post. So I did, no response. Figured they were doing something so I played some games while I wait. Then for some reason, something told me to check the rp request section. So I took a look and y\u2019all remember Chad? The one who played the \u201cShow-off giant\u201d? Apparently they pinged people in their to find yet another rp partner cause apparently they like to do this 8 interactions in with other people. My rp partner agrees, I was aware they had other characters but the strangest thing is that for available characters they had three..including the orc women that had existing interactions with my oc. They would mention the place their characters would meet and I looked through there. And as you guessed, the orc women was there rping with the giant. I swear this server had an attention span of a toddler when it comes to maintaining interactions. This is the part when I realized I was NOT going to get quality interactions and building up ANY type of story. \n\nI call them out on this asking them why they abandoned my rp interactions for someone else without letting me know or declining my oc offering her to have a castle tour? I believe they knew they fucked up because when I pinged them, I didn\u2019t hear anything for 15 minutes. But instead of trying to fix this by ending their existing rp and apologizing, they said this, AND I QUOTE: \n\n\u201cI am roleplaying two scenes with one character.\u201d \n\nDo y'all all see how this makes completely no sense from a realistic and logical standpoint? I asked how can their character be at two places at once? And they responded with \u201cdifferent times\u201d. So if it was different times why are you roleplaying with another person? This is when the owner steps in when they did they told me that they \u201cunderstood\u201d how I felt but I was being rude to the person. How was I being rude? Confrontational? Sure but how else did you want me to address the problem? \u201cOh um, Mary, you had interactions with me, could you kindly drop them and continue rping with me? :)\u201d? No. This was a huge issue. Not only did they abandon my interactions, but they also didn't think any of that was memorable and forgetful. Honestly with having to previously rp with someone who made me rush interactions just to rp with someone else hurt my pride and this made it crash and burn. The owner let the other person off with no warning while I was left with being called rude, my feelings invalidated and my interactions completely ruined. Yeah, cause that was fair.\n\nSo I left, but before leaving I made sure to follow what r/throawaymcdumbface said and flagged the server to discord because they allowed NSFW/ERP channels with minors posting things there. And I finished with my review off warning people, especially [Genuine] adults from joining the server as I fear that they would be doing ERP with potential minors. I don't want people labeled as a groomer because of the server\u2019s shitty age identification system. So much for that tourney arc, I was waiting for.\n\nBonus: Apparently, this wasn't the owner\u2019s first server but it was their second one. I know because I'm in an rp ad discord and I searched their history on the discord. The first server had even less detail than the last. Barely touched a paragraph length. It was the same plot, just a different name. And in that server had allowed NSFW/ERP roles available. This server was deleted, not rebranded. I know it was because their discord link expired. And the creation of the second server happened about 12 days after they deleted their first server. So not only did the owner learned nothing from their first server but they continued it on to their second server. In hindsight, the story, lore, everything about the server was low effort. No wonder why the owner accepted any oc that was sent their way. They sacrificed quality for quantity. \n\nIf you made it to the end, thanks, this post, unlike the others was an ACTUAL vent and It was nice to let off some steam.",

            "selftext": "I don't know how to handle the first problem, as I originally enjoyed rping with this person for a while. But then their replies started going down to a trickle, where they barely squeak out 1-3 lines regularly now. I proposed we do a revamp of the rp and I'm still getting the same result now \\[where they only squeak out a few lines\\]. I'm not quite sure if I should just try to bow out or how to even bow out. Especially since it feels weird to try to use the whole polite line 'I'm sorry but I don't think it's going to work out between us'; especially after rping with them for roughly 6, almost 7 months.  I'm also getting the impression they're quite busy IRL right now \\[as I think we've been only responding to each other every 2 weeks, sometimes 3 weeks\\]. It's resulting in this sort of weird burnout for me towards the rp where I pretty much don't have any fun with this person anymore. I'm a little clueless as to how to approach this problem honestly, as I'm not exactly the most socially graceful person. Do I just still say 'I don't think this is going to work between us'? Or is there anything a little better you can say to a person you've rped with for almost 6 months?\n\nThe second one's definitely my fault as I pretty much decided to try something new and out of my wheelhouse normally \\[as I normally do more generic noir fiction and decided to try to rp more fantasy things like werewolves, vampires, elves and etc\\]. I thought it'd be fun but I'm ngl, I'm pretty bored. I've also been having some health issues which is interfering with my abilities to really contribute anything meaningful or fun towards the rp. I'm just not sure if I should say 'I'm currently experiencing health issues which is preventing me from rping' or if I should say 'I don't think it's going to work out between us'. I'm only not sure due to the fact everytime I've brought up health issues, a person usually expects me to eventually return \\[despite the fact I never promise or actually say I'm going to return\\]. I don't want to raise this person's hopes or make them think I'm going to absolutely return at some point; especially when I'm probably not going to be returning to try to rp with them.",

            "selftext": "So I don't really do historical rps a whole lot, and the biggest reason is because I'm a historical dressmaker (like I literally have an 18th century dress that I'm recreating by hand in my lap as I type this) and studying historical clothes has absolutely ruined my ability to enjoy historical rp with people who aren't at least somewhat well-versed in historical dress. If it's historical fantasy or just a fantasy world in general there's some leeway but if your rp is supposed to take place in the 1890s... there are just so many misconceptions(No, your 18th century character is not wearing panties. No, saying she's wearing a 'victorian style dress' does not tell me anything. The silhouette of dresses changes wildly throughout the 60 years of the victorian era) but the biggest one that absolutely drives me up a tree is misconceptions about corsets. There's so many and the worst is when people want to fight me about them.\n\nCorsets are not the restrictive painful rib-breaking things people think they were. They were just a supportive garment and I could go on and on and on about historical details of corsets and the misconceptions but tbh the worst part of it is when someone writes about how horribly restricted their character is in a corset and I'm like \"Hey, just so you know... that's not how corsets actually were. If it's painful and restrictive, she's wearing it wrong.\" and people try to fight me about it? \"Well my 7th grade history teacher told me about how corsets would break rubs and crush organs\" Well your 7th grade teacher lied to you. I wear a reproduction 1890s corset on a regular basis that I made. I study historical dress for my career path. I know more about this than you. Someone once used the scene in pirates of the Caribbean as an example of how corsets were. Ah yes, pirates of the Caribbean. A movie praised for its realism.\n\nSo now I just can't deal with writing historical rps with anyone who isn't a historical seamstress because I swear to god if one more person comes to me with their Edgy Free character who Rejects Corsetry because she's a Free Woman not restricted by the patriarchy. Or on the flipside the Oppressed Woman wearing a corset that's crushing her organs so she's so delicate and fainting constantly.... Like Shut Up oh my god.  If you want to write in a time period, please do any amount of research into that time period",

            "selftext": "Well I'm just posting this to relate and also to vent. The story goes as this I have this friend who kind of got me into doing semi literate/literate rp for the first time around April. I really started to enjoy it so much we were literally creating a story out of it using characters from the same thing we liked. Actual plot advancement to alternate au with overall good enemies to friends to lovers concept in the genre for fantasy, action and romance. Then they just stop with the rp as in they constantly kept switching and wanting to do different au's with same characters it was fun but I got too invested more than them I guess so now I'm just left with cliffhangers with really good rp. It's painful like reading that one good fanfiction concept only for it to be left incomplete forever. \n\nI'm getting over it but what stings is this friend couldn't just straight up be like I don't want to do this anymore and instead now ignores me when I try to bring it up politely and treats me like a wall in dms. Only wanting to say what they want and not really respond back to what I have to say and it really hurts because they weren't like this before and now they're treating me like my ex Girlfriend/best friend did that also treated me like a wall and therapist to talk to and I quote \"a robot\". Overall I just despise it. Why do people like this always use mental health as an excuse to treat someone like shit I have it too but it hurts a few times of leaving a person on or ignoring a person is fine but making a habit out of it and blatantly ignoring anything they have to say just fuck off. It's even more awful when you have friends that are like you and will genuinely make effort and are communicative and decent people yet they're not into the same fandom as you and sadly you can't share what you want to do with them, it's not their fault that's just how it is but overall it sucks and hurts. \n\nThey recently just said that the rp we did well the fandom we did it from isn't fun as oc story rp so now I'm pissed off. Whilst they ditched me and are having fun roleplaying that with others, even though they ironically claimed to want to rp that so bad before but the person they wanted to do it with was busy(which is valid everyone has a life if you have something you need to do and can't rp anymore that's Gucci let me know and we can continue it later health and work is more important) and I was like....Are you fucking kidding me you literally said we would continue our rp and stuff when you were free and now that you are you're ignoring any mention of it and just continuing with what you want.\n\nI feel strung along and left on this hype train alone sure, I'll write out my rp's with this friend as a story and complete it, I got their permission but it's disheartening that I don't have anyone else who'd want to rp it with me because they won't understand it, aren't in the fandom and don't want to do it. I just feel robbed,upset, disappointed and lastly bored now. I'm still salty with this friend but if they ask me to rp just shutting it down and just no thank you.\nI still respond okay to what they say even though it's probably one word answers or just a sentence with an emoji because I'm also a slight dumbass for being a people pleaser that thinks that maybe I'm overreacting so I shove my feelings down inside but anyway, I hope you guys can find solace in not being alone dealing with the same scenario then again of course you guys will. That's why most of you are here but I hope you folks will be able to find better rp partners to match your energy.",

            "selftext": "This guy messaged me out of the blue on Discord, because we share a server that's connected to a forum RP site we're both on. I don't have any active ads on that forum. Everything I do have up specifically says \"I only write in group stories, so please don't message me for 1v1 play\" and \"I will only write smut with my writing partner, I'm not looking for new writing partners.\"   \n\n\nFurthermore, in every single hub server I'm in, I have my tags set up to say either \"Ask to DM\" or \"Closed DMs\" (meaning, don't DM me). There is nothing anywhere to suggest that I'm looking for 1v1 stories.   \n\n\n He messaged me anyway. Right off the bat, starts asking me about my personal life. How old I am (okay), where I group up (please no), where I am currently (dude!). He knew me by name as well as some other somewhat personal stuff, suggesting he at the very minimum read through my On/Offs page on the forum site. I reiterated that I only play in groups, then offered to link him to the main one I write in. It wasn't for him. No worries.  \n\n\nBut then he started complaining about how it's been so hard for him to find RP on the forum, specifically saying that \"people shouldn't be on it if they're not interested in ERP.\" Admittedly, the site does market itself as an \"adult role playing forum\" but that's not all they are by a long shot. They have several categories for threads that never venture into smut. It's not listed anywhere that ERP is at all a requirement to being on that forum.   \n\n\nHe kept going though. And this guy had only been a member of the platform for a month or so. I joined it in 2017. I don't know all the ins and outs of the forum, but I know enough that I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Moderator team. I love that while they may have started with that \"adult\" lean, they're also very open to those that want to write mature content without it necessarily being sexual content.   \n\n\nHe complained about how people list graphic turn ons and offs but then they refused to write a sexual story with him. I myself have some fairly graphic On/Offs listed in my own page, but that same page also says \"I only write in groups. I only smut with my writing partner.\" Most of us will list our ons and offs on the chance that smut happens, but we're not seeking smut. We're seeking stories and occasionally smut happens. Even those that prefer a lot of ERP in their stories, most of them want some type of story and getting-to-know the characters phase rather than being approached with \"let me put my character's dick into your character.\" \n\n  \nIf I had to guess, I would say his approach is probably why so few people wanted to write with him. He must have reiterated 4 times in the span of an hour's worth of conversation that he was well above the age of 40 and enjoyed age play RP with girls as young as ***16!!!*** I don't know why he kept bringing that up to me. I kept side-stepping it or ignoring it because it made me so uncomfortable, but he kept bringing it up I guess because he wanted a reaction? Like what am I supposed to say to that? \"Mmmm pedophilia!\" Wtf?   \n\n\nFortunately after it became clear he wasn't interested in the main server I write in, he left me alone since that was pretty much the only place he'd get me writing with him. I'm still just kind of floored by how this guy'd only just joined the platform and already he felt comfortable enough to tell people \"you can't be here if you're not going to let me dick you down in a story.\" Unless or until the Mods of that forum start listing it as a rule that you NEED to write smut to stay on the platform, you can miss me with approximately all of that.",

Vice versa, I get it when others ghost me whether life issues or they dont want to deal with me. Whatever. \n((Or a special case would be that one partner told me that they will be gone for 3 months for IRL things and its month 5 of radio silence)) \nBut I recently came across someone who I thought we vibed on over cheesy horror movies and had a good plot going in the same vein. We posted for a day and then... poof. I waited for a day and later on I messaged them on discord. Then on day two I reached out on reddit. \n( for clarification I messaged them 1 time on each platform) \n[[Is it clingy? Maybe)] \nI didnt demand they immediately reply, but just an update or if the RP wasnt going well... just a sign of life since both sites havent had any activity. \n\nI will admit I'm in the wrong and this is just Karma.

applies and i just need a place to vent about this since it's been weighing heavily on my mind, i hope that by posting here i can alleviate that. \n\ni've been collaborating with my longterm roleplaying partner since the summer of 2016. over the years, we have brought to life a variety of characters and stories, this has by far been my longest partnership as of yet. towards the beginning, it was great. we appeared to be on the same wavelength about so many things, then again we were both younger than and i don't think that either of us put in much effort into the plots/characters we created. \n\nas time went on, our characters, at least mine, became more complex, and therefore so did the plots that conveniently enough, i always suggested. looking back now, i don't remember a single time that they thought of a plot for us, at least one that was cohesive with the current story and not one that they just wanted to do for funsies because they just watched a show or film or saw something they liked on tiktok. it's only now that i cut ties that i've realized this, how much effort i always put into thinking of plots/settings/finding real world locations for our characters to hover in because all this content makes the roleplay feel more real. \n\ni've also noticed, and therefore become highly uncomfortable, with the fact that somewhere along the line over these last couple of years, they've developed this odd fascination/fixation on judaism (they would consistently talk about how they're suddenly \"jewish\" despite converting being a complex process, one can't just call themselves \"jewish\" and be jewish all of a sudden), and this fascination began reflecting in their characters. it made me even more uncomfortable that basically all their jewish characters were white jewish people of european descent, the only thing about them that seemingly made them \"jewish\" was the random jewish surname there or some random tidbit in the character bio about all the family members that gathered at their hanukkah dinners or whatever. \n\nthey began wanting to insert all these jewish holidays/events for us to play out in the roleplay (we stuck strictly to SoL/realistic/modern plots), which made me uncomfortable as i had no idea about any of the customs and wasn't sure that they did either seeing as they relied on random factoids off the internet to craft out these scenes. but whatever, i just went with that. \n\nalmost every single one of their characters came from some almost comically broken home featuring either a doormat of a father and a domineering holier-than-thou mother or some abusive asshole of a father who is out of a picture and some trailer trash-esque mother who couldn't give less of a damn. of course, her jewish characters came from the perfect family where the parents were in fairytale-like love and the father came home with flowers every evening for the adored wife. whenever i brought up this pattern, they would flat out tell me that that's the only way they know how to make their characters \"interesting\". \n\nover the last year or so, i've genuinely began feeling as if i am playing side characters in a story that is all about their character(s). the most recent example of this and one that i think encapsulates this feeling the best is when i had suggested a plot about these dancers in an exotic dance club, the whole roleplay was basically supposed to be about these dancers' lives both on stage and off, instead of it being about that it immediately became about their character and how she moved cross-country to be with some guy that she had never even seen with her own eyes, just texted/messaged or whatever, and how this dude ended up being a catfish, so now her and her daughter who is actually her sister because their mother was an ain't shit mom have nowhere to go and my characters basically had to end up helping her out the majority of the time that this plot was alive. absolutely no consideration for my characters and their struggles, or even the ***actual fucking plot***, just drama about her own character and how hard her life is because she has this daughter/sister whom she has to take care of. \n\nwe've also fallen into this pattern of me almost always playing the male character in an mxf ship, and her character basically being a major pillow princess when it comes to nsfw scenes. it has come to the point where i actually prefer to write the male at this point since her male characters are almost always some prince charming with a wounded heart that learned from his past and is the perfect lover waiting to propose tomorrow, or some exaggerated caricature of a douchebag/fuckboy with absolutely no redeemable qualities. a great example of this is some drug user that they brought to life, when i asked them what made their character resort to drugs/why their drug of choice is their drug of choice/how that came to be (you know, basic fundamental questions that one should know when they play an addict), they basically had no answer for me. \n\ntheir responses/response time has become increasingly less active over the last year to year and a half. keeping in mind that shit comes up and people have lives, i've asked them on three separate occasions to just let me know if they need a break/to put things on pause for a bit, for i more than understand that shit just comes up, since i tend to lose muse if the response time is sporadic and unreliable (we've dead ass had singular scenes drag out for months, i'm sorry but how many people can keep muse for that character in that scene for that long?) every time i've requested this, they've apologized and assured me that they don't need a break/that they're fine, but the behavior still continues. \n\ni think what finally sealed the deal for me that this was finished is taking a look at the google docs we share for our character sheets and seeing that just about every one of her character sheets is incomplete/basically missing a shit ton of information. when i moved my characters out just to compare lengths, i saw that i have dozens upon dozens of pages more worth of writing. it was not only infuriating, but it was embarrassing seeing how much effort i've put into writing these things for a person who doesn't even read them. \n\ni am angry, i am bitter, i am resentful, but i am still sad/filled with an air of emptiness surrounding the entire situation. i wish they would've just been honest with me regarding not being able to continue this, or perhaps needing a break and returning when life isn't so chaotic, but in order to be honest with someone, one has to be honest with themselves. and i genuinely believe that they think that they had it under control and that they'd be able to keep their promise of being more active. \n\ni just refuse to continue putting in effort where it's clearly not appreciated. this is also exemplified in the fact that over the last year, i've basically been writing paragraphs only to receive a smidgeon's worth of a paragraph in return that basically doesn't tell me anything about their character's inner workings, thoughts, etc. i genuinely think this is because they themselves don't know how their character feels since they create characters on a whim but never flesh those characters out. \n\nbasically the moral of the story here is, don't put in the effort with someone who doesn't reciprocate it and appreciate both it and your time. roleplaying should be a fun, joy-producing, creativity-exploring hobby, not something that makes you want to rip your hair out of your scalp and eat it. i really do hope to find a longterm partner that can make this hobby feel alive again. if you read all of this, thank you.",

            "selftext": "What I mean by a one-way roleplay is when one person is coming up with everything for the story; the world, the plot, and the events are dictated only by them. Based on what I've seen, there are two extremes to this: They are forced to come up with everything because their partner refuses to do anything to add on to the plot, or the person refuses to allow their partner to add on to the plot. \n\nI get a lot of the former. I'd post an ad with several plot ideas and in that ad, I'd request for someone to help develop the plot. I always allow my partners to use more than one character, so sometimes, this works out just fine, resulting in an engaging roleplay that both of us are enjoying. However, most of the time, people respond to the ad, send their character info, and then just... react. By that, I mean their character just reacts to whatever situation I set on the table without adding to it. I try to keep my plots open-ended to allow it to go anywhere, so the scenes and situations I present can almost always be built upon by both parties. \n\nFor example, this is happening to me right now, and I'm considering dropping the roleplay I'm doing with this person. I explicitly stated it would be an action roleplay, but when I mentioned an academy for training, their character latched on to the academy idea and had no interest in anything else. He asked no questions about it, like a dog who just heard the word \"outside.\" I tried to introduce another character to the story, but his character quickly dismissed them in favor of going to the academy without even introducing himself. My character, who is his character's trainer, told him it wouldn't be like a highschool or private school or anything, and it would be more like a barracks. Apparently, that killed his engagement quickly and now his responses are dry because it's a combat roleplay instead of a highschool slice-of-life roleplay (again, in the ad, I explicitly stated it would be a combat and action roleplay, and there would be no romance or slice-of-life involved). His character would do absolutely nothing unless I put a situation on the table for them to react to. Even then, his responses would be dry and colorless, being something along the lines of \"he nods\" or \"he smiles\" or \"'I understand,' he says.\"\n\nHonestly, it just feels like I'm writing my own book with someone watching and MAYBE inserting themselves into the situation if they like it. It's like I'm a babysitter dragging a bored kid around the park THEY asked to go to. After a while, I just get exhausted and leave because I have no interest in entertaining someone who doesn't want to add on to anything. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting, but if I'm forced to do everything because my partner doesn't want to give their input, I get burned out very quickly. It sucks because I'm trying to find new partners outside my usual partners and broaden my horizons. This hobby is meant to be fun for everyone involved, not a chore for one person and mild entertainment for the other.",

            "selftext": "So, a little bit of context. I've been running this fandom server on discord for three months now, and recently just added a few channels dedicated to roleplaying as I saw a lot of members were interested in it. I made a few character bots, starting setting up some detailed plots and scenarios, and I was really excited to see the majority of members getting really into it and writing an average of 2-5 paragraph responses. \n\nHowever, some of the people who only write one-line responses have decided to \"claim\" my fanon characters to be in a relationship with their OCs, meaning that 1) now I'm forced to spend most of my time focusing on people who aren't as dedicated to rp as I am, and 2) am constantly left making all the decisions and plot points myself, as they make minimal effort and just continuously write about how in love with my characters they are. \n\nAnd then yet *another* member on this server, while they put more effort into their responses, are continually having their characters use their magical abilities to cancel out any drama or problems the main cast has. For example, once there was a situation where my character had been knocked out, leaving only a couple other fighters who were in bad condition to try and escape with him. It was supposed to be a moment of character development and angst, something me and these two other rpers had been looking forward to for a while, and they just sent in one of their OCs to \"*morph into a dragon and crush the enemies bones into dust*.\"\n\nI've tried telling the both of them gently to put more effort in/lessen their characters powers, but both of them just throw in excuses. Person A says they don't have time to write more cause of school, which is questionable when I see them writing long messages out of roleplay; and then Person B threw a fit, saying they had developed their characters for several years and it was unfair to call them OP for just having a different level of power than everyone else. \n\nSo I'm at a loss for where to go from here. Honestly having all my free time taken up with trying to placate these two, fulfill their roleplaying needs, and also run the server has been rather exhausting, and has left me feeling increasingly more demotivated to write at all. \n\nDo any of you have advice for how to handle this situation better than I have?",

            "selftext": "WHY is everyone on r/Roleplay so goddamn horny all the time?! I don\u2019t mind adding in a sex scene here and there, honestly. If it feels natural, I\u2019m more than happy to contribute to one. But good GOD I\u2019m annoyed right now!\n\nI found a really, REALLY good partner, let\u2019s call him \u201cL,\u201d who I have been doing a long-term Roleplay for over two years now on that subreddit a few years back. L\u2019s become a good friend, so much so that I talk to him about personal life stuff and politics, sometimes we\u2019ll game together on Switch, discuss interests, etc.,  and we know that writing a scene like that probably isn\u2019t going to happen because we want to world build. Great, awesome, super! That\u2019s L\u2019s choice, and I completely respect that. Fast forward to Monday.\n\nYes, this horror has only been going on for THIS WEEK. \n\nI message someone (we\u2019ll call them \u201cS\u201d) looking to Roleplay in the same fandom as I am currently RPing with L, and we get to talking about what we want to do, hoping I can find a new plot in the same world I\u2019ve made with the last friend. S and I get an idea, say we want to establish a history, and maybe have a scene or two with some NSFW content so long as it adds to the plot. I mention VERY CLEARLY that while I\u2019m comfortable writing sex scenes, I don\u2019t want it to be the sole focus of an RP. S agrees and we set up.\n\nWe get going, everything is great, and then we get to the first adult scene. No big deal, this is how the characters are confessing their love to each other. We definitely jumped to it a little early in my opinion, but whatever, it is what it is and it felt like a natural point to do so. I\u2019m not expecting it to happen again for awhile. S then mentions how we should do another scene like that but during the holidays. Okay, getting gratuitous in my opinion, but whatever, I can roll with it, make it an expression of gratitude for over the moon gifts. WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN FINISHED THE CURRENT SCENE, AND S HAS SUGGESTED AT LEAST FIVE MORE SEX SCENES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT WE ORIGINALLY DECIDED ON. It\u2019s gone from two characters trying to learn about each other\u2019s world to \u201cAlso I had an idea for a future scene where maybe your character blames my character for something he didn't do. When your character finds out he was wrong his apologies [sic] to my character but as a playful payback my character decides to punish him. He could give him a potion that makes your character horney [sic] all day.\u201d Exact message except for omitting character names.\n\nDude, invest in a dating app or some alone time. Oh, and stop controlling my character. I fucking hate that.",

            "selftext": "I've used Reddit as my main source of finding people to roleplay with over the last year and I've reached a point where I'm so jaded that roleplay doesn't even seem fun anymore.\n\nI primarily roleplay on discord and it's such as hassle to add people because nine times out of ten, they stop responding without a heads up - leaving me waiting and my discord cluttered. It really sucks when you find a person that you like chatting with and your creative chemistry shows promise - and then they just *disappear*.\n\nAnd for the record, I know that nobody owes me an explanation. And that, after a certain period of time, I should just delete the servers anyway. But I've had long breaks before - one such instance of this led to me becoming close friends with somebody I used to write with.\n\nOther than that, I've had people that didn't leave servers or remove me from discord, but they also just ignore messages. Now, I don't spam people - I'll ask once and if they don't answer, that's it. It just sucks to know that people are obviously active and can't be bothered just to say, \"Sorry, I'm not interested anymore.\"\n\nBut do you know what's even worse than flaky partners? People who don't want to put any effort into the RP. I can't tell you how many times I've written a prompt and talked out the details with people just to get a one-line response. It's reached a point where I actually have to put *semi-lit, third person past tense only* - but in doing so, I've also received fewer people who are interested in my prompts. That always seems to be the kicker. Hardly anyone wants to put any effort into writing a decent story - and I am no master author, believe me. My style is pretty casual. But is it so much to ask that the other person carry half of the story forward?\n\nIt's even worse with ERP servers - but that's a whole new can of worms. Mostly because those servers are filled with desperate men who can't respect boundaries or lie about their identity so that someone will write out their fantasies for them. I don't mind having NSFW elements in my stories, but I always like to have some sort of action oriented plot along with it - but the second you mention that, people lose interest. OR - they try to push your character into a situation that they normally wouldn't be in to suit the NSFW side of things.\n\nIt's just too much effort to invest in a hobby that you *rarely* see any return from. I'm just tired. It isn't fun anymore. It's just another chore.",

            "selftext": "MC = My Character\n\nJust for a little background, I had just joined  a group RP where it was something of a modern myth type of roleplay, where magic and gods walk amongst men in a reforming post apocalyptic world. \n\n\"Oh hey, this sounds nice!\" - My foolish ass.\n\nIn  hindsight, I should have  realised how it was going to end.\n\nSo, I joined it and decided to make a normal human, I wanted to make a foil to everyone else being some sort of god or eldritch being, using science and logic as opposed to using nothing but magic. So here I went checking their lore.\n\nApparently, deities came back and waged a war that ruined Earth to the point where it gave resurgence of old magic races, pushing humanity to the brink. Nowadays Humanity has recovered, regaining their technological standing and then some, which brings it to present time in the RP.\n\nBut the moment I made my human, one of the roleplayers had it out for me.\n\nEvery single new development I had in furthering humanity's tech to reclaim lost lands, he'd come along and just type out:\n\n\\*It turns to ash and blows away.\\*\n\nOr\n\n\\*It breaks.\\*\n\nThe worst one was when he just said that  wasn't allowed because it was sci-fi, even though I was using modern tech.\n\nHe just banned it anyway (He was an admin).\n\nNow at first I thought nothing of it, but then after a whole month of seeing it fade away to ash, the guy tries to do it the moment MC was in a life or death situation (The guy's other character was a vampire and a goddess) came on, turning almost ALL of my gear and mode of escape to ash, and paralysed my character and tried to suck my character's blood. Then \"somehow\" knowing of exactly what other stuff MC had on him that he used for defense against their kind, and having the \"perfect\" counter to, without explanation. Luckily MC managed to get some good deals with some other good people on the server and with their help, managed to escape.\n\nI finally confronted the guy, and he was an *intentional* nihilistic ass!\n\nHe was droning on about how pathetic humanity is, and how they shouldn't advance, and how they should be nothing more than toys and how *evil* humans are even though his deity character (who was portrayed as good somehow) was going on killing people at random.\n\n(This wasn't IRP, this was OOC btw)\n\nThe weirdest part was when  he tried roleplaying as literal GOD'S WIFE AS ABELOTH (From fricking STAR WARS). \n\nThere was some other weird stuff with Jesus, but it weirded me out too much to pay much attention to.\n\nSo I eventually after a few weeks or arguing, I gave up and left the group chat.\n\nNow, if there was one good thing to come out of this, is that it kind of brought about my patriotism towards Humanity.\n\nHumanity F\\*\\*\\* Yeah.",

            "selftext": "So? Context is needed here.\n\nA couple days ago I found an add, The add had a very simple and sweet idea I thought sounded very nice!\n\nComplex ideas are my favorite and all but, I\u2019m sure a lot of you can definitely agree Burnout is a writers bane. So I read this cute idea and thought to myself\n\n\u201cYeah! That would be great!\u201d\n\nSo, I sent them an introduction..started with a a little joke I thought up, told them about myself..\n(Name, Experience, etc.)\n\nTheir first response was a red flag for me.\n\nThe tone, and the punctuation was just off..\n\nWhatever, put it aside for now. Could just be an odd hour for them or something?\n\nMoving on they wanted me to pick from a slew of refs they bombarded me with. I picked one honestly out of random and they sent me a\n\n\u201cTheir alright\u201d\n\nI thought maybe that was like, their least favorite?\nSo I told them by all means I\u2019m not picky.\nThey went on and basically just had a roundabout way of telling me\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me pick my ref\u201d\n\nOkie doke..\n\n2/2 on the red flags so far here..\n\nAfter a bit of talking they asked me for ideas and if I had any. I told them I did not, because honestly at the time I didn\u2019t have really any ideas to add\u2026but, again, that was just at the time. I\u2019m sure if we kept going I could think of something. Even told them that.\n\nTheir response?\n\n\u201cWhatever I don\u2019t wanna lead always it\u2019s not fun\u201d\n\n\nI mean I agree with them their but, I mean this was indeed *Your* idea that you  wanted to do. I really liked the idea so I said I\u2019d love to it!\n\nWhatever once again\u2026\n3rd red flag for this and I\u2019m honestly debating on to just leave.\n\nBut being the naive, and rather open person I am I decided to ignore my internal thoughts and keep on going.\n\nSo the rp!\n\nFirst response from them?\n\nYeah it gave me nothing to do.\n\nThey put my character \u201cinto deep sleep\u201d and left all in one interaction\u2026I did what I could with what I had I\u2019d say. I matched their quality, which if we ignore grammar and punctuation, was..decent. That\u2019s what id rate it.\n\nWell over about 1 hour of interaction, their posts degraded more and more into about 3 lines at maximum..\nThen out of the blue they ask me if I only do third person.\n\nSince that\u2019s how I\u2019ve written for about *6 years now* I told them yes. I\u2019m extremely used to using it and it\u2019s hard for me to do first, plus I personally don\u2019t like using it.\n\nBut that being said I\u2019ve no quarrel or complaint to anyone who does use it!\n\nI\u2019m more than happy roleplaying with, or alongside someone who uses first person. Not a problem at all!\n\nSo I told them that yes I do, and asked if that was a bad thing?\n\nTheir response?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it\u201d\n\n\u2026..like\u2026ok??\nNot only did I ever ask you to change your style, I didn\u2019t even mention it until you did.\n\nI\u2019d never ask someone to change, I\u2019d always say to do what\u2019s comfortable for you in that regard.\n\nThat\u2019s about when I was getting really irritated. The lack of effort and that comment really struck a nerve with me..\n\nYet, naively, I again just ignored it.\n\nSo 6 or so more replies go by and I feel rather tired, so I tell them I may pass out. If I do I\u2019ll gladly continue when I wake up.\n\nThey send back in essence-\n\n\u201cEh I dunno you aren\u2019t really fun\u201d\n\nI just stared at my screen for a solid minute with pure irritation running through my veins.\n\nI told them I\u2019m not gonna deal with this anymore and I\u2019ll leave them alone if I\u2019m being such a bother.\n\nThey said\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\n\nAnd never said another word..\n\nSo back to my question.\nAm I an asshole?\n\nDid I do something?\n\nDo I have the right to be irritated..?",

            "selftext": "A long time ago I had created a group RP housing somewhere around 30ish people. It was a My Hero Academia RP; this is important because the main theme of MHA is \"quirks\" which are \"super powers\" that characters have. \n\nAnyways, I'm one of those people who make lots of OCs for the fun of it - sometimes I never use them, sometimes I put them on the back burner for another time. I also really enjoyed posting about them in a sub-category I had set up in the server specifically for OC ideas or advice. So at this time, I had posted roughly 3-4 OCs all with different ideas. \n\nThe MHA server was slowly becoming a disaster, so I took a few friends and started a new server - a Jojo server. It didn't go very far in the end, but at the time I just wanted to do anything to get away from the hell that was the MHA server. One person in particular I took with me, the OC stealer. \n\nWhen I created the new server, it was supposed to be a server that was all new characters and a completely new story line - so everyone had to make an OC. To do this, you had to follow the skeleton I provided; part of this skeleton was \"stand power.\" I'm sure you see where this is going.\n\nSo this dude posts his first OC idea. I read it, slowly realizing that...this OC is one of my MHA OCs...just with a different name and gender. I call him out for it, asking where he got the idea.\n\n\"I made it up.\"\n\nMind you, I save l my OCs. So I find the one he copied, damn near word for word, and send it to him.\n\nHis response? \"You clearly stole that from me!\"\n\nI'm sorry? I did what now? How the fuck can I steal something from you when I clearly wrote this many months ago - I even screen grabbed my folder date to prove it.\n\nHe exploded. I told him \"whatever it doesn't matter just make another character.\"\n\nSo he did - this time a new OC all together...but USING THE SAME QUIRK IDEA I USED WITH ANOTHER OC I POSTED. Mind you these aren't basic, generic quirk/stand ideas; these are things I've worked on for a really long time that are both scientifically and realistically accurate - the second one he copied was one where it was based off hallucinations and whatever they see can actually hurt the victim (but no one else around them, so it looks like the victim is mentally deranged). \n\nI called him out again - mostly because that OC idea was my absolute favorite. His response?\n\n\"You can't steal all the good ideas and you have so many OCs, can't you just spare one for me to use?\"\n\nUh. No? Make your own character what the fuck? How uncreative can you possibly be to not make your own character or stand idea?!\n\nI basically gave him one more chance, but he told me I was an OC snob and I 'took all the good ideas.' Then he rage quit. No skin off my bones - and everyone else I invited who ALSO saw my OCs all came up with their own ideas and characters so clearly he was just lazy. \n\nJust.make your own damn characters it's not hard. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "So I'm the bad RPer in this one, but a couple of months ago something really traumatic happened to me (I lost someone dear) which filled me with regret especially regarding the time I spent roleplaying and I ended up ghosting a couple of partners and blocking them. There was this one guy that I used to talk  to and RP with that I ghosted. We used to talk everyday and we really wrote well together. I ghosted and blocked him and deleted the roleplay out of the sheer feeling of guilt on my shoulders (Had nothing to do with him). After a few days, when I felt a bit better,  I went back and talked to him and apologized for ghosting and blocking him, but I guess he really was heartbroken about it and there was nothing I could do to mend things.  After that I decided I needed sometime away from internet and to get a grip on life. I send him a few messages in between but he did not respond to any of those.  \n\n\nFast forward a couple of months, I held my shit together and everything is back to normal more or less. I missed roleplaying so I joined a discord sever where I saw a random person enter the server and I liked his username so I messaged him and asked whether he wants to RP. Turns out its the same guy ( I am 100% positive on this!). I'm  kind of lost now, should I tell him it's me or don't mention it? I really like him and enjoy talking to him/writing with him and I want to continue to do so! I am afraid if I reveal myself he will just leave! What should I do?",

From someone who did lots of one-liners up to almost multi paragraphs, this has been fun.   I think I can say by now what settings I'll take more time to learn and which ones I'd fit.\nFirst-person and third-person POV:\nI keep it simple (1st) to prevent extending it and delivering a confusing post. The same case applies to the third-person, except that I'm descriptive with this.  I used both POVs (simultaneously) many years ago and can tell you guys it worked just fine.\n\nMy current case:\n*With character development, I noticed that it needs more practice rather than going with the flow and watching where it leads, considering filling character creation sheets from the simple ones to the complete versions. Maybe I'll find my niche, what looks practical to me.\n*I've been ignoring attributes, treating it like a feature for powergamers to rely on when this could help me and give me more options of what to do.\nCombined with writing, this would give me a better margin of success.  I try doing something balanced, for example: Attribute A is good, B is lacking.  \nOkay, sometimes I hold back and give off an easy target perspective, aware of this. I'm not used to this kind of stuff and avoid making it look forceful in the end.  Between not caring at all and caring too much, I stick with doing my thing, putting some effort to keep it fun, and making sure that I'm having fun as well.",

He even had a lot of good moments, going out of his way to help children and adopt stray cats and children.\n\nBut this guy, thought that meant EVIL ALL THE TIME (We'll call him EG).\n\nSo at the time, MC (My Character) had joined a police force in cracking down on a known murderer (who was another role-player) and the moment she tries to kill herself, MC tries to stop her being a lawful character, he wants her to stand trial. But EG just comes in, tackling MC and calling him a fraud and evildoer for trying to stop the suicide of another person.\n\n...WHAT.\n\nThis extended for quite some time, every time MC would do something, EG would be right behind calling it an \"evil act\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMC: Organising a space force to colonise planets.\n\nEG: \"OH, SO YOU'RE GONNA COMMIT GENOCIDE ON EACH PLANET YOU FIND?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on for a while, but eventually I managed to tune him out.",

            "selftext": "So I saw another recent post about how someone in a group RP had someone trying to kill their character, which brought up a memory I\u2019d thought was long repressed. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve been Roleplaying for over 10 years now, and I\u2019ve used the same OC the entire time. His name is Okuro Ishimoto, like my Reddit username. I know, little 8-year-old me thought of that while he was perusing Pok\u00e9mon RP forums on the family computer, and somehow it stuck! \n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve gone with Okuro as my OC\u2019s name and put him in various universes. Star Wars, Pok\u00e9mon, DBZ, Marvel, you name it. You can also check out the RPs I posted on my profile if you\u2019d like! But I have a hard time switching between names for various OC\u2019s, so rather than try to remember with all the RP\u2019s I do, I just use him! But that didn\u2019t fly well with a certain admin of a Facebook group I\u2019m in. \n\n\nI had recently been Roleplaying with this Admin, in a Star Wars plot that I had been brewing up. In this RP, Okuro died at the end. A little while later I posted an It RP, and it got denied from the group. The Admin note simply said \u201cOkuro is dead. Use another character.\u201d When I asked about this, the Admin said that Okuro had been \u201cAdded to the list of dead characters and could never be used again.\u201d I figured I\u2019d just leave the group, but they started commenting on my posts in OTHER groups that had no such rule, saying that the character was dead, tagging mods and admins to try to get my post deleted, etc. Of course, of their attempts were thwarted, probably because anyone they complained to had more than two brain cells. \n\nBut yeah, just a little mini-vent here.",

            "selftext": "So I respond to someone's advertisement, and we happily message back and forth for a bit about ideas before they leave me on read, presumably to go to bed.  No problem. \n\nI was on vacation at the time, meaning I may be slow and unable to respond to messages right away, and this person knows that because I told them.  However obviously I'm not *so* busy that I can't reply at all, and it's not like I'd make them wait more than a few hours. \n\nI get a message the next day, \"I'm getting off work soon and will be available to chat!\"  Meanwhile my message I sent them is still sitting there unreplied-to.  I'm not sure what this person wants me to do to initiate conversation when it's their \"turn\" anyway.  I reply saying that they can simply respond to my message and I'll respond to them in turn when I have time.  \n\nNo response since, not even to my suggestion,  despite the claim they would be \"available to chat.\"  Thoroughly ghosted because I wasn't available to chat in real time at the moment and suggested simply responding to the message that was already sitting there waiting for a response.  No attempt to even ask when I would be available if it was so important I be online at the exact same time.\n\nGuys, the point of texting is that you don't have to be online at the same time as someone else and communication can be asynchronous.  Is it preferred to be synchronous?  Absolutely.  But it makes literally no sense to require it of someone you know is busy and ghost for no other reason.",

            "selftext": "So I've recently made a second account purely for roleplays, I dont like how it clogs up my personal account and it overall felt alot more organised for me. \nI've made two posts so far, both being practically the same but posted on different subreddits.\n\nI got my first post up on a subreddit dedicated to anime roleplay specifically, I almost immediately got met with people that just flat out ignored me and my ad. For example someone who came across interested, sure, but hadn't read a single word of my ad. I stated which characters I wanted to play as, what genres I liked, and even very clearly specified i wanted MxM. And nothing processed in their mind; questions like \"who are you playing?\" \"Wanna do FxM or FxF?\" Just immediately made me feel like she obviously didn't care enough to read through. So I politely told her it wouldn't work out. \n\nBut whatever, right? I got my second post up on a subreddit i have some good experience with, and I actually met someone pretty good! They matched my writing style, they ACTUALLY read my post. And everything was fine..\n\nI got another message request, and they seemed pretty nice in their first message , ive never been one to have a strict rule about only being allowed one partner, especially cause the fandom has a variety of characters and plots to explore. So I figured it was fine; they wanted to play an oc along with the character I specified I played as, and even sent me a little Google docs file of plots to choose from if I wanted. However every plot mentioned their FEMALE oc, which already made me kinda suspicious. I told them i would be interested, but asked if they only played as female, to which they replied yes. When I told them as politely as possible that I wasn't comfortable with that, I figured that was the end of it. It's a little annoying, but it's not like I'd gotten attached before finding out we weren't a fit.\n\nHowever what really baffled me was the next message along the lines of \"you should write that in your ad next time!\". They didn't come across as angry at all, but that was almost worse, cause maybe I'm bad at reading tone but their entire attitude after I told them came across as very passive aggressive, or forced positive. (Now I'm talking all messages, not just that one line.) However that ONE line really irked me. It confused me so much that apparently I was being blamed for a mistake on her part??\n\nKeep in mind, this is stated twice in BOTH ads. It's in the title, mentioning \"[M4A playing M]\", which is..very obvious about me wanting someone to play a MALE character. Atleast literally everybody else in that subreddit uses the same kinda lingo. \nAnd I even mentioned how \"I'm okay with all ships as long as its MxM\". I figured mentioning it in the post and in the title was enough, but I guess not.\n\nI've had plenty of people not bother reading my entire starters/ads/etc, but these are my most recent, and the last one probably being the most annoying. Maybe I'm just overreacting though. \n\nTldr; people can't seem to read that i only do MxM roleplays, or read in general.",

I just work, come home, play video games, watching anime. That's it. I don\u2019t have friends to do things with so my main way of getting some communication is chatting online. Found roleplaying as a way to escape my boring, lonely life. Hopefully, make some friends along the way. So it\u2019s almost used to cope with it. Realized there\u2019s a fine line between a fun hobby and a hobby you use to cope with the shitter parts of your life. The difference is this hobby involves OTHER PEOPLE. Real people who have lives outside of roleplaying and just do it for leisure. And I don't have a life so that's going to clash and put people off. \n\nMost of the time I just wait an hour before giving my response so the other person doesn't get the idea I have nothing else to do. It's the same for games, I play alone or set my status to invisible. I've had people tell me I lack a social life due to how clingy I seem. So I just try to stay distant and the cycle goes full circle from here.\n\nSo I'm just gonna quit. Don't want people to deal with me. Just too many bad experiences with this hobby.",

            "selftext": "I know I'm preaching to the choir here as we all have felt the loss of a good roleplay partner turned friend.\n\nBut I need to get this off my chest.\n\nMy Queen's Gambit RP buddy has been silent for almost three weeks and before that, was much less frequent in both the OOC and IC. The thing is, we used to chat pretty frequently when we started. It took a few weeks to warm up to one another but we ended up clicking really well and his writing even improved (which to me didn't need improving to begin with) as did mine. It was really a delight to befriend him and progress our story. During stressful weeks we'd just chat lightly on our OOC channel and that was totally fine with me because I began to enjoy talking to him as much as I enjoyed our RP.\n\nBut soon after we started writing, it felt like his mental health took a decline and reading between the lines about what he disclosed of his location/upbringing, mental health was not something he paid much mind to. I tried to gently push him to look into therapy. I avoided using the word depression but my mother treats those with depression and anxiety (as well as substance abuse, and I have anxiety and used to suffer from depression as a teen) so I know the symptoms and he was pretty much ticking all the boxes. It worried me greatly, not just because our story was picking up steam but because I really cared about him and wanted him to get help so he could begin to lift some of the weight off of his shoulders. \n\nI'll readily admit I'm emotionally attached to him. He's helped me through some tough times and he's opened up to me too. It doesn't feel one-sided though. \n\nPart of me is worried that our RP had some negative impact. He sometimes says how he'll never match my writing or how bad his posts are compared to mine. I don't understand where he's coming from at all. His writing is amazing and there's never a post where I've felt at a loss as to how to reply. I tell him his writing is fantastic and he's an exceptional partner and sometimes I feel like I'm the one struggling to match him. \n\nAnyway, like I said, it's been a while. I miss him a lot. I've sent him a few messages letting him know to take whatever time he needs away, that he could reach out a month from now and I'd still be so excited to talk to him, even if he wants to drop our RP. At this point, I'd take some form of communication and contact, even if it means losing my best RP. Getting pings form discord are tough when I realize it's not him reaching back out. It feels so pathetic but I worry about him and that if he's getting help, he's not giving up on himself. \n\nI know we all have had someone like that, a great partner and friend who you want to help but due to the internet, support can be terribly limited to a keyboard and a website. I just hope he's okay and slowly finding the joy in his life. It's a process and I think it's important to check on the mental health of yourself and your RP partners from time to time. We're all humans, (hopefully) just trying our best.\n\nThe pessimistic flipside of that: I know some might exploit their mental health to use as an excuse for not posting/contributing to brainstorming/having OCs with certain traits/and such, when they're not actually depressed or aren't as overwhelmed as they say. I know some might just be lying to garner sympathy or manipulate a partner into accepting things without much protest. Follow your gut. I also know it's important not to let a partner's mental health drag you down either, that it's good to lend an ear and offer advice if you can, but (I'm guilty of this) you can't let their emotions infect your own. There is value in setting boundaries with partners and taking care of your own mental health too. If you can no longer play their therapist, tell them. If their characters or OOC topics are too negative, tell them. If they need time to post but you feel like setting them a deadline to do so, so things don't grow too stagnant (Hey, can you post within the next week? It's been two weeks since I posted and I'm anxious we might fizzle out. If not, do you have a timeframe in mind? Would love to chat more when you're free and in a better headspace.), communicate that. Being aware of your and their mental health should be a two way street. :)\n\nAnd it sucks missing people haha.",
