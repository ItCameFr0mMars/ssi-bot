            "selftext": "\nJoined an literate server. TLDR it\u2019s a civil war between supernatural beings (SB) and humans. The SB comes into the world, some humans are fascinated at this, others not so much and want them gone. SBs likes the world and not the humans.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ongoing storylines like a group of assassin humans hunting down said SBs and the SBs dealing with this and politic stuff. Though what I\u2019m the most worried about is the balancing between SB and humans. So for the human race, if they aren\u2019t a witch/warlock they don\u2019t have any abilities. If the human is a witch/Warlock they can have up to 4 different abilities. Then on the SB side, they can have up to 12 abilities, 4 of which that are abilities they\u2019re born with like \u201c4.95/5 chance  to detect a lie, superhuman speed, strength, and can cast illusion on themselves and other items.\n\nNot gonna lie. I even asked the mods jokingly \u201cwhat\u2019s stopping the SBs from blowing up the world and the anti-SB organizations\u201d in which they reply with \u201cthe mods and they wouldn\u2019t resort to genocide\u201d. But then I told them my slight concerns over the power balancing cause I made an hypothetical situation of like what if I/others were to play the assassin group. Cause the last thing you want is a story built on tension and conflict ended in with a group of SBs overpowering the humans with no effort. I was told that they\u2019re weak to iron and you can use sneak attacks and manlipuation. They raised some good points but in the lore, they don\u2019t die from them and they really don\u2019t specify what happens to them if they come in contact with iron. And I have my doubts about the manlipuation thing working because they can detect lies unless you do half truths but a human wouldn\u2019t know they can detect lies unless they see it firsthand. And using sneak attacks as the \u2018only\u2019 way to get them will seem repetitive which is what I don\u2019t like. I like many dynamic fights because not all humans will fight dirty or in tricks and it might clash with ideals if they resort to it. \n\nI got an extension on the character creation stage but I\u2019m still unsure what to do with my character and how I can implement a storyline that both races can be balanced and conflict can be created and last. The mods did encourage us to make our own storylines which is nice but I\u2019m just scared it\u2019s gonna get blown away by a group of SBs. Is lies and trickery the only things I can do if I make a human oc? Sorry if this is all over the place, I\u2019m stressing over this.",

One was probably half a year old but had been silent for a while on their turn. I message them to say I'm probably not going to carry on waiting and they reply the same day? Why couldn't they reply for a month before that? The third had only been going a week but was really enjoyable and I was really looking forward to it.

I have made attempts to talk in chat and start up roleplays. I am not doing very well. I have had people either ghost me, or inappropriately flirt with my character through dms. If I have not shown interest they will ghost me. Finding friends has been a bit hard, even the person who invited me has sort of distanced themselves away from me.\n\nI feel a bit left out and I am struggling. I am trying very hard to be outgoing and show interest in other people and their characters but I keep getting this vibe of being ignored. So I have grown a bit depressed and worried I am doing something wrong. I don\u2019t expect the red-carpet but I did hope to connect with some people who are there but now I feel it is best to leave.

You wanted to be closer to him and that meant putting up with me.\n\nI know now the things you wrote with me were only because you couldn't have those things with him. \n\nI know now you used me as a sounding board when you got into a fight with him. Me, a moron, would always give you advice, support you, and speak on your behalf.\n\nI know now you were jealous of me.\n\nI know now you hated me. \n\nI know now you wished I wasn't around.\n\nI know now that I was a thorn in your side. \n\nI know now that you didn't think of me as a person, but an inconvenience. \n\nI know now you said terrible things about me behind my back - to the people I defended you against. \n\nI knew a lot more than you believed I did.\n\nI knew you had an alarming capacity for cruelty.\n\nI knew you put others down because you thought they were bad writers.\n\nBecause you thought you were better.\n\nBecause you were jealous of how they looked. \n\nBecause it made you feel better about yourself to put people down who'd done nothing to you.\n\nI knew you didn't care about my feelings.\n\nI knew because I only asked for your support two times over the course of our entire friendship.\n\nOnce was when I was in the hospital, scared, and you decided you were angry at something I'd said weeks ago.\n\nI knew because I was feeling particularly vulnerable one day and asked for your reassurance.\n\nYou said no.\n\nI never received any reassurance from you.\n\nI never was allowed to be sad, because somehow that was insulting to you.\n\nI never was allowed to defend myself against your accusations even though you would misread my words, because it meant I was invaliding your feelings.\n\nMy feelings were pushed to the wayside.\n\nInconsequential.\n\nYou sent me mixed messages. I could not ask for clarification because that was pressuring you.\n\nYou said that made you feel bullied.\n\nI apologized.\n\nI apologized so many times even when I was confused about what I did. \n\nThe friend you did care about remained my best friend.\n\nWe kept writing.\n\nYou became crueler towards me.\n\nYou made comments about threads S and I wrote together because they didn't include  you.\n\nBecause they didn't mention  your characters. \n\nWe had to change entire plots because you were upset if our characters did anything that could even be perceived as separate from your characters. \n\nAll our plots had to revolve around you.\n\nOur actions were dictated by your emotions, or we were punished. \n\nYou projected your sadness onto me and interpreted my words and actions through the lens of your emotions, then refused to believe anything but your own perspective. \n\nYou invented a person that never existed, and you never cared to know me. \n\nYou cried to me that you had nothing to offer S, without realizing that you'd expressed disinterest in all of our plots, ships, characters, and ideas. \n\nYou dropped everything you had with me and lamented your loss of S. You made it clear you didn't miss me, or want me.\n\nAnd you didn't have to. That's okay. But it hurt so, so bad. It hurt not to feel good enough. It hurt to feel like I couldn't have a voice, that what I felt and wanted didn't matter, and my self-worth plummeted. \n\nIt hurt when you told me out of the blue that you were done with something you knew was important to me, but that wasn't the final straw. \n\nYou mocked me. \n\nYou mocked a painful situation I'd opened up to you about. \n\nWhy?\n\nWhy were you so cruel?\n\nWhy couldn't you be my friend?\n\nWhy couldn't you care about how I felt?\n\nWhy did it always have to be what you wanted, without guilt, without remorse?\n\nYou apologized to me a few times. You knew what you were doing was wrong.\n\nThen you'd talk to people who'd never met me or knew the whole two year saga of this struggle, and feel justified in your rampant hatred of me.\n\nAnd here is when I get angry.\n\nYour accusations were unfair.\n\nI never took you on a guilt trip. You felt guilty because you were in the wrong. Plain and simple.\n\nYou lied to me, you betrayed me, and you felt justified in doing these things.\n\nYou don't care that you've lost me, but you've lost S, because the person you are became evident. Someone so twisted and ugly inside can't hide their true selves for long. You were making us both physically ill every day. You raged at me because he changed his face character, accused me of changing mine without telling you first (then realized you were mistaken and had just forgotten that I'd told you), and the nasty vitriol you spat about your supposed \"best friend\" was eye-opening.\n\nYou truly disgust me. I don't know why I ever wanted to be your friend so desperately. What saddens me is that you've involved yourself with all our mutual friends, and sooner or later you will hurt them too. \n\nPlease get therapy. Stop harming people. You have narcissistic and borderline tendencies and you are extremely damaging. You never deserved anything I gave you. I wish I could take it back. I wish I could erase myself from your mind so you can't think those poisonous, disgusting thoughts that I never deserved. \n\nYou violated me when you drunkenly asked for selfies and made me feel uncomfortable complimenting my looks, knowing I was married. \n\nThen you told S you were \"horny\" and immediately launched into a weirdly timed sex scene that made me feel sick to my stomach.\n\nThe next day, you accused me of being sex-obsessed in spite of how open you were about BDSM and being the one to lead sexual conversations, preferences, and kinks. I never cared that you were sex-repulsed, but you made me feel like I was pushy or making you uncomfortable, when it was literally the opposite.\n\nStop playing the victim. Don't go ask your roommate if you're right. You're not. You're a toxic, terrible, cruel, and ugly human being. I used to feel sorry for you, but I don't anymore. You are miserable, and because you are miserable, the only thing you did toward the end was talk badly about the people you \"loved\" and fly into rages over perceived slights. \n\nPlease get help before you hurt more people.\n\nS and I were lucky to leave when we did. Your emotional bulldozing and bullying behavior drove us both into the ground. It took us a little while to pick ourselves back up, but we've recovered and we've started a new chapter that will never, ever have your shadow hovering over it. \n\nPlease respect both of our NC decisions and stay gone. Please. I don't want any apologies. I do not want you.",

I used to think that as long as someone is responding to my post, there isn't much chance I won't be compatible with them or not want to RP. Boy I wish I was still that naive and optimistic.   \n\n\nThese people find every possible way to RP something different  than planned or take you out of your comfort zone. I miss when they actually came out and asked if we could do something different, because that wasn't the most awkward thing in the world, I could still talk to them about it. Now I'll get a message that is just BARELY convincing enough to make me think they are interested in my post and understand my boundaries and then BLAM! I'll add them off this site (or sometimes still on this site tbh) and it's like I'm talking to someone completely different. We're suddenly not talking about the RP at all, we're talking about some deal they came up with so we can do smut or they'll have missed the majority of my post and will only focus on some vague detail that has nothing to do with my ad.   \n\n\nHere's the thing guys: If someone wants to do something different than I want, my interest will still be there as long as they ask in a respectful and communicative way. The same goes for if my plot/idea changes with discussion, that's awesome because we're creating something together! It's this sneaky way people will go about getting you to do something you EXPLICITLY stated you were not comfortable with that really gives me the creeps.   \n\n\nMy theory is that most people probably just go for it because there are no repercussions. The loss VS gain balance in trying to get someone to RP something you want even if they said they weren't interested highly leans in the horny person's favor.   \n\n\nI'd like to say that internet RP has always had this negative side to it and I'm just being nostalgic but honestly? I've never dealt with this behavior in such concentrated amounts. I hate that this is something that I expect to happen now and I filter my messages accordingly. Does anyone else have stories or have noticed people becoming increasingly shameless with ignoring your posts and/or making you uncomfortable?",

Is it bad to quit on a hobby when you feel like it\u2019s not making you happy, fulfilled whenever you do it? Of course, the reasons for quitting depends from person to person. Full disclosure this is coming from a person who has quitted rping. \n\nIn other places, some people see this as an invitation to contact said person who quitted roleplaying to join their rp forum, group, line, or discord. It\u2019s almost as if they think their rp group will FINALLY be the one to ignite your fire for roleplaying. No, half of the time it won't. Respect the person\u2019s wishes of them quitting instead of attempting to make them stay and risk making said person more miserable- because they're already made themselves vulnerable and the worst thing anyone can do is take advantage of that.",

            "selftext": "Hey, this is my first post here but I have had this problem s ince I started rp in discord. \nI have talked with some people but some don't care and some doesn't think I'm right so I have came here to truly see of what I think is actually true or if I am being stopid. \n\nWhen people read the question, most go for the bad rp players, the ones that have the main character syndrome or someone would is God players but those people are normally newbies or they are selfish. They are one of the problems but easier to overcome. \n\nThe problem that I am thinking about is very simple but can break rps. \n\nThe problem is, the prohibition of character killing! \n\nPlease listen first, of course no one likes their character killed but because of that in every situation the player goes for the fun, if a new villain appears and no one knows him and no one knows their powers, (I have been those villain in a lot of servers) the players just goes for the fight, there is no hesitation, there is no fear of what that villain is able to do. And that can break rps, it's like you are a simple MMA fighter and then madara from naruto appears and goes to fight you and you fight him, like there is no thinking. \n\nIt's the same thing in casino games, if you are not betting money you go into every opportunity, you never fold. \n\nWell I kinda need to see if I'm right or wrong and also comments what kind of problems you suffer when rping!",

I RP in (insert random language-that-no-one-cares here) and I'm still learning English and don't know where else to post this \"rant\".  Please don't judge me \\*cries\\*\n\nTL;DR: partner doesn't make me a priority unless she fears I'm gonna move on\n\nMy partner knows I like Samus and have decided to create one in a website for roleplayers so she can RP smut with me. \n\nWe both are long members of this site. We both also use Discord. But I don't like roleplay on Discord. She does\n\nShe agreed that I should create a private forum on this RP website. I not only created but did everything to make the forum looks nice. HTML. Photos. Basically a Metroid themed private forum\n\nI initiate our RP with a post and one week later she jokingly said she rather RP on Discord and teased me to RP on Discord. BUT THEN (here comes the confusing part) she started to RP with a lot (and I mean I lot) other players on that RP website. Weeks have passed. She kept starting and finishing multiples RP on the website but never our own RP. I've never rush her or anything because I think is just bad and I like when people RP with me because they truly want and not because I'd to ask for a reply\n\nI had to leave the internet for one weak because of personal problems. I think she thought I was losing my interest on her and replied to our RP two days ago... one month later\n\nI really don't know If I should reply or just find another partner",

It sounded pretty fun, inspired me to make a new OC which I don't always do but I spun one up, really liked it, spent multiple days plotting out this story and got to writing.\n\nTwo days in they approach me and tell me they're real sorry but their partner that vanished off the face of the earth for a couple weeks is back and they're really wanting to do this plot with them.\n\nWhich ??? Cool. I'm not entitled to anyone's time, I get that. But can you not spend multiple days wasting mine and plotting something out to ditch me when someone better comes along? Now I gotta go chase down the people I turned down because I already had this story and hope some of them are still open.\n\nI don't know, just a vent basically.",

            "selftext": "Let me preface this with: I like romantic storylines, but I like ones that have a dynamic storyline with conflict and adventure. I have found exactly *one* RP partner who gets that, and we've made some epic storylines together. I've found, however, that the circles I RP in now *only* want to ship, they don't want to do *anything* dynamic-- and I fucking *hate* it. I've seen RPs outright die because of this.\n\nIt happens all the time to me; I create what I believe to be well-rounded characters with flaws and backstories that open the door for dynamic storylines and strong interactions... and then someone looks at the face, realizes they're hot, and disregards all the work I've put into my character to make them a romantic couple with their character. I've made the mistake of letting some of my characters get involved, and here's what happens:\n\n***N o t h i n g .***\n\nThey immediately stop making *any* effort to connect with the character once they're an item. They show *no* interest in who my character actually is, what flaws they have, what their secrets/hopes/dreams/fears are. They don't want our characters to argue or have ***any*** conflict.  They don't want ***any*** conflict in a story to come up unless it's the \"you save my character because you love her\" plot (and even then they want it resolved *immediately*). They don't want to do *anything*, explore *any* storyline, make *any* meaningful connection. They want my character to sit around, feed them bon-bons, and tell them how pretty they are. I've had characters I ***loved*** be absolutely ruined by making the mistake of shipping them. If I try to break the ship, the player gets all moody OOCly and talks about how shitty my character is being, or how sad they are, or just generally try to guilt me into keeping the ship going. \n\nI like dynamic, epic storylines. I love being dramatic and angsty. I love seeing my character have flaws and grow from them, and I love having something to **do**. Yet, I keep running into people who just want to sit around and be that cute couple in high school together, and I am **so** over it. It's really burned me out and made me want to step away because there's no point in writing anything out, when it's always just ending in my character basically being domesticated and put into the same role every time.",

            "selftext": "So, this is more of just ramblings and less about a specific story and more about an overall problem that I've had when I look for roleplays.\n\nI'm the type of storyteller who looks very deeply into most settings, especially real world, that I roleplay in to make sure I don't get any details messed up. One particular setting I do a lot of research into is Japan since I'm fascinated by the culture and, I'll be honest, I'm big into anime and manga.\n\nI will look up so many articles just about one thing to make sure I get it as accurate as I can, whether it be about looking up the name of a very specific article of clothing or making realistic character names. Authenticity is something that really draws me into the story and makes me excited to explore further. However, this love for research I have has gotten me very demotivated with some of my recent stories.\n\nI don't expect anything perfect, not in the slightest. I'm not perfect in my research and I have to fill in the blanks with my own imagination but I try really hard to make sure I get everything mostly right. But some of the things my partners have written has me feeling very... confused? Baffled? Things that are pretty common knowledge-at least from my own knowledge-in Japanese culture, or very easy things to look up, aren't treated as such. Stuff that you'd see in any basic anime even. \n\nI don't want to come off as the type of person who thinks everything has to be perfect all the time, just the way that I dictate it, and that I don't allow people to have their own creative freedoms with what they do and whatnot. I'm just sad that people don't seem to share my same passion for knowledge on these topics in order to make something feel more authentic. It really makes me lose my spark\n\nAm I being overdramatic/sensitive here? Should I try loosening up? I'm not sure but I just needed to say something in case someone could relate to my plight.

So essentially, pretty recently I had this idea for a RP server to make with a couple friends. On the first couple of days it goes pretty well, we actually got some people who aren\u2019t one liners for once. However, as of lately I noticed that pretty much all interest in the server completely died off and keep in mind that the RP hasn\u2019t even had a chance to start yet because some important characters haven\u2019t been claimed [Its a fandom RP server.] I just feel kinda frustrated because I feel like I\u2019m the only one who really cares about the server anymore and I feel like I put all of this effort into it and nothings really coming out of that. In fact, even most of my friends dont really seem to care about the server anymore. Is it because public RP servers are just doomed to fail? Is it because I\u2019m not advertising it well enough [Im using sites like Disboard]? Is it because its fandom RP? Honestly almost makes me want to give up on any interesting RP ideas I have since I feel like they never really work out.",

Do something to force them to get involved. Watch a movie, read a book, play an RPG, note how it's pretty rare for characters to flat out go *looking* for trouble - it comes to *them*.\n\nAnd the characters usually try to do whatever they can *not* to get involved in it - until they're pushed up a tree and have to figure out how to get out of this. Even \"Active\" characters like a lot of detective fiction and crime thriller protagonists will have some kind of plot circumstances that puts them in specific areas. Here's a good way to put it: If you want your players to solve a puzzle? Give them pieces - and give something to make them think what this piece does. \n\nIf you're running a public plot, and people are actively *trying* to get involved, but keep getting sent to the bench? Don't be shocked when they have a negative opinion of your plot or they give up. Don't tell them \"You get what you put into it\". Think of it as a team sport. The substitutes *do* want to play at some point, and if they're told \"You get what you put into the team\" but are only good for keeping the bench warm or practice? Then don't be shocked to find them not showing up for practice or spend every game on their phones. If you keep benching them because \"They haven't proven themselves\"... don't make a surprised pikachu face when they're not going out of their way to actually try to get involved. *They're* not getting what they put into it... so why not just put *less* into it according to what they get? *You're* not needed - your absence won't harm the team. We know Equivalent Exchange is a lie and Dante from the 2003 series was right. \n\nThis was literally why the basketball team at my sister's HS crumbled, because the benchwarmers kept quitting. \n\nThis is just me venting right now.",

And hope to the high heavens that someone not creepy will come along and answer our craving for a good interactive story?\n\nWell, do I have a story... I had made a post for a plot about a girl who goes off in the forest and wanders a little too far. While in this forest she comes across an ancient dragons cave. Now I had dragons structured a bit differently. They could shift from their draconic form to a more human like one. The dragon was a colector of books, and knowledge. They did not hord gold like your typical dragon.\n\nI had gotten two people who contacted me interested in this plot. One of which I'm still happily rping with. I like accepting more than one person on a plot because different people take the story in different directions. The role play itself was pretty fun. However, I play on discord and I use servers. So I have a tab for out of character chat, the rp, and a list of the characters were using. What made this rp stop came from the out of character chat.\n\nWhat first struck me as odd about this person was that they asked me to prove that I was a female. I ignored this at first, but eventually just sent them a short voice clip. In retrospect I shouldn't have done this. As the rp went on I talked with them about future plot, and fun senarios to add. However, I noticed some thing odd. They kept making advances towards me, and not my character. So I confronted them about it and told them I wasn't interested in finding someone. They seemed to take it alright, but they still didn't stop pursuing me. I ignored most of it or feigned ignorance, but it all came to a head when they said that I quote. \"I wish the NSFW part of our role play was real.\" If that wasn't bad enough they sent me a video of them rubbing their d***. At that point I was so disgusted and annoyed that I ended it.  \n\nWhy do people think it's okay to try and pursue people based on a role play when, they have clearly stated they weren't looking for such things? Whatever the reasoning I think I'm just gonna stick with the role plays I have for now.",

            "selftext": "At first it was fun. I loved rping; I started off from fandoms and rping on Tumblr then moved on to making my own characters and stories. I open my stories up to rp friends who want to be a part of the world I built. I always include a doc about the mechanics of the world and lore like history, culture, how this and that works etc.\n\nBut there was a person who crushed way too hard on my male characters. ONLY my male characters. I've known them for years, and they were fine at first. It was fun making these stories and AUs with them.\n\nThey kept one-off shipping a specific OC of theirs with just about every single canonically taken male character of mine sexually. I won't go into details, but I'll say that at first I let it go. It could a one off thing and I'm okay with vanilla or basic sexual rp.\n\nBut it got worse and worse into rape fantasies. I get that with every person, everyone's got their favorite ships fantasies. This was too much. It wasn't just that mine was neglected (this was noted in how detailed they got with their favorite ship compared to mine). They were insistent on having a bunch of other characters on this one OC.\n\nI felt used. I tried to draw the line and explain why it made me uncomfortable. They deflected and said \"Well you do all this gore stuff and it triggers me.\"\n\nI said \"Okay. Let's talk about comfort zones then.\"\n\nTruth is that I didn't do the gore rps that much. It was always brief details. Nothing beyond describing things as bloody and grisly. They've done their fair share of the same thing. I didn't really understand how it triggered them when they did the same but maybe there was something I missed.\n\nThen afterwards, they let up and slowly tried to fish me back in or fish around to see if they could get me to engage in over-the-top racy rp. This was over the course of two years.\n\nI am open to story ideas and new things. I like slice of life and fluff and drama and just about everything under the sun. I love a good story and cohesive writing and the introduction of new situations and how characters react. But this person slowly weened off that and stuck only to the sexual fantasies. The amount of normal vs sexual rp was balanced but when it was sexual it felt so... Off. It felt like they were using my characters to sate a sexual fantasy or relationship fantasy in their heads. It got to a point where they used my character's name in a writing assignment for a short story and claimed \"Oh, I couldn't think of another name.\"\n\nOne of main characters in that writing assignment used a part of their name.\n\nThey're out of my life now and I'm glad for it. While I miss the normal stuff we used to do, I don't want to go back to a person who wants their one self-insert character to be the center of everything. At the end of all this, it felt like they tried so hard to be a \"main ship\", but with the worlds and rules I set, I take care to make sure every character involved has their fair share of attention and pivotal moments. This was not respected and this character felt like she teetered on breaking every single rule in place.\n\nI'm sorry that this is so long, but I couldn't talk to anyone about it for a very long time. I tried so hard to give them the benefit of the doubt but nothing was adding up. I have anxiety, depression, and a history of overthinking and I couldn't tell if my gut feeling was right at all or if it was just all in my head.",

I have already come to the conclusion that I'll have to do that sooner or later, so while it is reasonable it will not really be helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo around almost three weeks ago, this person approached me for an RP. It's a very niche idea, so I was and still am pretty happy about that. They're a quality writer and our styles seem to mesh compatibly. \n\n I wrote a starter but we only exchanged a few responses after they stopped responding. I usually give it three days, but since we had just started, I asked them if they were still interested in continuing the day after.\n\n Two days later, they told me that they were and that they would respond soon. The next two days after that, they responded and we finished a scene. After that, they stopped responding, so three days later I asked them if they wanted to continue. They apologized and told me that they did, but they're in the middle of moving so it would take them \"a bit.\" \n\nAs a person who has moved numerous times and has lost unsympathetic RP partners because of this, I can understand that. But they posted an ad the day after. That said, after that, they didn't post anymore.\n\nIt's now been nine days since they've responded. I haven't asked them about it since then and just told them to respond whenever they were able to. I know that the moving process can take around a month. But they've been pretty active since then all except for one day (before anyone says anything, I have made it clear before we started that I like at least three responses per day, of course, I don't mind if anyone else is more comfortable with more or less frequent responses but that's just me). \n\nI don't log out of my accounts or sometimes I only check my account so I understand account activity being detected does not necessarily equal actually being active on your account. The times this person is active are few and far between (or at least I think so, I don't try to earnestly see when they're on, as I've learned from that past that doing so is not helpful for either party) so I'm pretty sure that's the case.\n\nThe difficult thing for me is estimating when I should remind them and if there is a specific way that I should when I do. Should I wait a few days or up to a month? And if it comes to me having to throw in the towel when should I do that? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhank you in advance for the advice! I'll give a small update whenever I go through with any choice.",

(Sadly, these relationships often fell out after the RP ended, but I'd say it's the same after you stop going to the same school with your friend - much less reason to talk to that person daily.)  \nIt's just been baffling to me and been wondering if it's just me when it comes to this, but no RPs where I haven't clicked with the other person well got to last for more than at most a month and that's being generous here.",

            "selftext": "Okay, I read the rules and I will not give out specific names or link to the community in question. Just know that this took place on the largest One Punch Man amino. I like getting this story out because it decreases my overall anger about it. \n\nAlright so on the Amino app you can make wikis about your OCs and frankly, I find it easy that way so that you can quickly look up info on a character or even user you're RPing with. Not to be invasive, but to know whether or not you're wasting your time. But the community had kind of a problem. Most of the public RP groups available sucked. So I learned there was a more private RP club. And at first, I was like \"Cool!\" And I asked the guy there if I could join. So it went uneventful for a while...until there was a little plotline. Allow me to make something clear about One Punch Man and One Punch Man RP in general. There can be but one One Punch Man: Saitama. That reason being so you don't make a redundant character. And generally people say to avoid making a Blast character since most of his abilities are unknown. Another thing that should be known is that S-Class is among the strongest of Heroes in that universe. Alright? Alright. So during this plotline, one of my S-Classers ended up in a one on one fight with his. He one shotted my S-Classers trump card. I said NOTHING when it happened. Treated it as fair game, he was the host after all. Couple weeks later. We're doing another plotline during the Garou arc. For those of you who don't know, Garou is a villain who has so far been capable of defeating a lot of S-Classers in a one on one. So it's kind of a given unless you are Silverfang or Tatsumaki, you're probably gonna lose. So some of the C-Classers were getting their asses handed to them by Garou. I merely SUGGEST bringing in a stronger hero. This guy goes off. Calls my OCs Overpowered. Along with several others insults like, for real just starts ranting. I'm like \"What.\" I merely reply \"Dude, are you serious right now? You one punch my strongest character and you have the nerve to say that?\" And he keeps ranting and raving to where, all RP for that night and like a week was shut down. So, I take matters into my own hands. See, I kind of acknowledge that if you're doing a RP with OC's you're doing an alternate plotline and timeline. No matter what. So I run with that and made some other alterations to the verse I thought of. I made and promoted my own chat and he went nuts on the post about how much it deviated from it. Eventually the post just devolved into how much I just don't like his attitude how he \"Can't help it\" etc. etc. So naturally the post was removed. I guess it is my fault in that regard in viewing anyone I'm talking to as someone who CAN be reasoned with. But point being, I was done with the place for a while, had a presence and everything, just didn't really interact. I decided to make my verse on discord. Grew it nice and healthy and even drew other disgruntled people from the amino. Eventually I was actually allowed to advertise my discord there. Perhaps my first mistake. Another bit of info here. I ALLOW character hook-ups. I make explicitly clear, what people do in their DMs is their business, but NO NSFW content in what is ostensibly the public chats. Dude in the main chat calls me a Pedo, an asshole for \"Stressing out his friends\" or some shit. Naturally he gets booted, but I was tired of this absurdity. He is also friends with the mods there, I BEGGED them to do something about him. Whether it was on the actual platform or not, SOME kind of consequences needed to be imposed as there is crossover between people in my community and theirs and they know about all this. I was ignored. They said they had it under control. So I also do some YouTube content too, posted a fandub of One Punch Man: Road to Hero on there...and sure enough...dude appears in the comments section of the video. At this point, I already had him blocked on the app, and virtually most other social media. Blocked him there too, but this was getting ridiculous. He goes and brags about it in a chat...and at this point I tell him to \"Leave me tf alone or I'm actually getting the authorities involved.\" Mods give ME a f\\*cking warning as well. I'm starting to seriously question conflict of interest issues at this point. So I start building up a smaller One Punch Amino, dude follows me there and it's not until I show him the screengrabs of the authorities I'm about to call that he FINALLY backs tf off and has at this point left me alone. I don't have screencaps because it was a while ago and I actually got banned from that amino for \"Making a chat without permission and other stacked violations\" basically image claims I FORGOT to add to wikis. Not that I was claiming the art for myself. I just forgot to add the claim to it. And was given a violation anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBad RP is where this story started...sorry if it went somewhere else, but I just needed to get it out. Let me know what you think.",

            "selftext": "I'm not proud of myself in the slightest but I have to admit my faults.\n\nI have a very bad habit of accidentally ghosting people due to burnout, and that has been especially the case now. I have little to no motivation for a few reasons, either with the roleplay itself or just my brain not being in the mood. It doesn't help that sometimes my mental health takes a big dip and I just don't feel like talking to anyone for any reason so I disappear for a few days to a week or so. When I return from these accidental breaks, I'm always usually not sure what to say to get back into things, especially if I've already apologized once before for taking a break. Do I apologize again? Just say I'm back and act like nothing happened? Those are the questions I ask myself.\n\nThen while I'm trying to figure out how to get back into things, my brain begins to wonder if my partner is ever still there waiting for me or if they left. I'm too scared to check to see if that's the case but I know I have to respond so it becomes an endless loop until my partner actual does leave without saying anything beforehand.\n\nWould this be considered self-sabotage? Because that's what I call it and I hate it. I know there are better ways of solving these issues but I either forget or my anxiety kicks in and I just wind up sitting around fighting with myself over what to do.\n\nI don't think any of my partners really read my posts but if any of you guys happen to be reading this then I'm sorry for taking so long, I'm trying to get my motivation back and work up the will to talk to you again.",
