I've tried to start another roleplay with them \\[figuring they lost interest in our current one\\] and I've gotten a similar result \\[where they only send me three sentences to my 3 paragraph starter\\]. Admittedly it's making me ghost them as I don't know how to deal with this issue. I know it's a dick thing to do, but I wanted to give myself some time to think about how to approach the issue. I'm still drawing a blank though, despite thinking about it for a month.\n\nOriginally they were much more detailed, so I'm not quite sure what's happened. With the exception of ghosting; I'm just wondering if I might've done something wrong \\[leading to them becoming less interested in writing with me\\], or if they might be having IRL issues they don't want to discuss. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this issue? As I'm pretty confused. The partner told me they were interested in still writing with me (leading to me starting a new rp for them), yet their writing doesn't really show it in my opinion.",

So after being on the server I planned on making two characters whose stories connect. The plan was to make a chaotic good/neutral faction that\u2019s goal was to unite the races humans and SBs together. This would give some of the human characters a chance to be important to the story if they wanted to join. The character sheet was extensive and adding up on making two characters it took two weeks to make. So when I posted the characters, editing them so they can get accepted. There was a male SB and a human female I made, TLDR they met each other years back and now they worked towards a similar goal of uniting the race because they both suffered through it. In the backstory of the maleSB, he was born closer to the modern time so he's the youngest among most SBs who were +500. Realistically, the older a person is, the more they are resistant to change. So making the maSB young was necessary to create the story of how he struggled with both worlds. FeHU was a witch who used her powers to take down criminals and stepped into arguments between humans and SBs but she was met with indifference. \n\n\nBack to the maSB, the mods looking through the character sheet had a problem with his age and indirectly wanted me to change it. I explained to one of the mods the above reasoning for why he's in his 20s. Didn't get a reply after that message. So I sent in an edited version and they said that the age and apparent age were missing even though I already put an age there. So it was a sign they still wanted me to change it. There's nothing in the lore stating how aging works in the story or the min-max age SBs can be so I thought it was fine. Changing his age means that his backstory and the FeHU would be needed to be changed too and it ruined the vision. After spending so long on making the characters I just left out of frustration. Felt like all of the time spent on creating them led to nothing in the end. But even if I did get them accepted I would mostly be roleplaying by myself, which I don't mind but soon I would want to include people into the storyline but there are not that many people in the rp group.\n\nIt just sucks because the rp has the potential and it's been so long since I was able to find a fantasy literate +18 rp. Was also excited to use my characters but I guess not.",

We were going back and forth, had some ideas, and they even made a server.   \n\n\nThen, out of the blue, the server is gone and I\u2019m unfriended and blocked on Discord. I reached out on Reddit to ask what, if anything, I did wrong. Their response?\n\n\u201dDon\u2019t worry you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I just changed my mind about RPing at the moment.\u201d\n\nFair enough. It happens. Doesn\u2019t really explain why I was blocked on Discord, bur whatever. Fast forward a few weeks, and I\u2018m browsing RP subreddits. I found a post that was interesting, and went to go message the person. As I go to write my introduction, I feel like their name is familiar. Lo and behold, it\u2019s the exact same person. \n\nI guess I\u2019m glutton for punishment, because I reached out anyways. I asked if they were back into RP, and they responded with a resounding \u201cseems like I am.\u201c \n\nMaybe it\u2019s out of desperation for literate, seasoned partners, but I threw out the idea of giving a collaboration another try. They agreed, and said to add them on Discord.   \n\n\nWell, I tried, but I was still blocked. They sent an invite my way and we were back to it. Made another server. Everything was going well\u2014we were at the exact same stage as prior, picking faceclaims. Then, as I\u2019m away for a few minutes, the server is gone. And I get this:\n\n\u201cHey dude... I sincerely apologize, I know this is totally uncool, but I just gotta be honest. I don't know how to put it into words, but for some reason I'm just not comfortable with you. You didn't do anything wrong, I just feel we don't really go together well and its making me uncomfortable and nervous. I understand this is super unfair to you, but we're both into roleplay to have a good time, and I just can't do that if I'm not at ease with who I'm RPing with. I hope you find an RP partner you can have fun with and have great RPs, but it sadly won't be me.\u201d\n\nUnfriended. Blocked. Again.   \n\n\nI\u2019ve been RPing for close to 15 years, and seen my fair share of people not respecting boundaries or overstepping IC/OOC barriers. I know what it\u2019s like to have someone that makes RP more of a chore than a pastime. It still doesn\u2019t make this any less confusing, and, to be honest, hurtful. Why give things another chance if you\u2019re going to do the exact same thing? Sure, maybe it was my mistake for reaching out again.   \n\n\nI just don\u2019t get people sometimes. RPers be cray.",

            "selftext": "So this is a mini-rant, mostly because I want to get it out of my system. If the flair is wrong I apologize, but I think I got it right?\n\nI\u2019m in a modern supernatural/monster rp server, I\u2019ve enjoyed it a lot so far and even if there are some mini-horror stories I can tell, for the most part it\u2019s a lot of fun. However, there\u2019s one character that just irks me a lot. Not for any giant issue, they have a well thought out backstory, personality and the creator is a really nice person, but there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t get over. The name of the character. \n\nThe character is Native American, and was born 400 years ago, so right about when colonizers began to come to America (European Colonizers at least) He belongs to the Cherokee tribe however, his name is *Ahiga.* \nAhiga is a Navajo name meaning \u201che fights\u201d not Cherokee. I doubled checked bc I have a Navajo character (not for the same server) with the same name, and from what I could find there is no Ahiga for the Cherokee people. I wasn\u2019t too annoyed by this at first, I figured it was an honest mistake. So I Dmed to let them know. Here\u2019s how it basically went: \n\nMe: Hey! Just wanted to let you know Ahiga is a Navajo name and not Cherokee!\n\nThem: Oh ok!!\n\nMe: If you want I can help you find a Cherokee name that\u2019s similar in meaning or starts with an A if you want haha\n\nThem: No thanks I suck at changing characters I\u2019ve already made unless I hate them or something hahaha\n\nThat\u2019s the point where I got annoyed. Like, they know the issue now but they don\u2019t want to fix it bc they already named the character? (Please do correct me if I\u2019m wrong as Im still learning about the Cherokee) Names are important to the Cherokee, and to a lot of Natives, a lot of them had a naming ritual and your name could change depending on the person or actions said person took. It just seemed a bit disrespectful that even after they knew they got the wrong tribe/wrong name they just didn\u2019t change the name or the tribe the character was from. \n\nIt\u2019s just an oc, I know, so I\u2019m trying to not get too riled up about it. It\u2019s nothing bad enough for me to say much else I think, but it does make me not want to rp with the character. Especially bc I have a character who is also really old who would\u2019ve had experience with the Navajos, and I know my petty butt wouldn\u2019t be able to point it out/have my character tease theirs about it.",

Meanwhile, I sometimes have to go as far as Discord just to see a sample of someone's writing, and then I'm going to end up with incompatible writers who now have my Discord info.

Still, what they're proposing doesn't sound like the kind of thing I want to do with this character because I don't exactly enjoy having their personality do a complete 180 from what it actually is, so I politely let them know. After all, they're in my good graces right now.\n\nWhat follows is the *most* condescending speech I've ever heard (starting with \"Let's take a step back here\", which is a GREAT opening line) about how it'd be okay if I just didn't want to do it because I didn't like it, but it's not acceptable that wanting to, you know, *play my character* is 'holding me back'. That nobody's going to 'judge me' for not playing my character 100% the way they're 'supposed' to be played, and that sometimes our RP partners are more important than being 'afraid to say \"what if\".' That they're a 'flesh and blood person' and what THEY want is MORE important, obviously, than what my CHARACTER would do.\n\nThey end this with *\"Tl;dr: the \"imaginary roleplay police\" aren't as important as what your partner wants.\"*\n\n...Holy shit.\n\nOf course, I promptly blow up at this *unbelievably* entitled little creep for not understanding literally the most basic concept of 'no means no' and thinking that they have to right to demand *anything* of me, because I'm a *flesh and blood person* too, there are no strawman \"roleplay police\" just *my preferences* and I've made it clear what I'm not interested in doing, and I could tell them whatever reason I damn well feel like and they can just accept it because oh my god who talks like this?\n\nTheir response?\n\n\"So the roleplay police are more important than my request? Blocked.\"\n\nAnd nothing of value was lost.\n\nWhat baffles me is how this came out of COMPLETE left field after we were literally, one minute before, talking about what an enjoyable time we'd both had writing what we'd *agreed* to write.

            "selftext": "Apologizes for double posts but this is more of a separate issue. My partners are again awesome people so no issues with that but I feel like their interests have slowly been fizzling out. \n\nRight now I have three current active partners. The first one I mentioned was \u201cAlex\u201d. The two in this story I\u2019ll call Emma and Paige. So I met Emma and Paige around January of last year. Amazing writers and we hit it off the bat right away. Although communication was sparse on my end with Paige due to a growing attention on Emma and I\u2019s rp everything has been smooth sailing so far. I\u2019ll start with Emma. Recently, Emma has been getting a little distant. I can\u2019t remember when, but I think it started a couple of months ago. Granted they were in the process of moving jobs and other issues but I could tell the interest wasn\u2019t quite there. The replies were few and far in between, and they hardly responded to general chat messages. \n\nMaybe I was imagining it, or misinterpret it, it very well could of been. However we patched it up and actually became better friends in the process. Except that it\u2019s been happening again. Granted, I haven\u2019t replied in a couple of weeks due to health problems and classes, but even so communication with them has slowed significantly. I\u2019m talking once every couple up days or a week response to the general chat. Then again I was on vacation so maybe they just didn\u2019t want to be a bother? I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I\u2019m just starting to rationalize it or maybe I\u2019m being too inconsiderate. I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThe issue with Paige really came out of nowhere. We did slow communication our first month in but it was more on my side and was much more gradually since I lost interest. However, I can now confidently say this is one of the top rps I\u2019ve ever done and always look forward to it no matter what. Nevertheless, communication with them slowly dropped around two weeks ago. After inviting me to their group chat with their friends, I\u2019ve noticed they\u2019ve responded a lot less with me and the interest in the rp has diminished. Not too long ago we spent hours chatting and brainstorming. Now I\u2019m lucky to get a few messages out of them and they tend to change the subject when I bring it up. \n\nThe thing with Paige is that they\u2019re in a completely different time zone unlike Emma. So in order to catch them and talk to them I have to stay hours past my bed time (which was late to begin with). I even had spent all nighters just waiting for them to reply when I knew they were online. I loath myself for doing it too. I feel nothing more than a hopeless stalker at this point although I\u2019m probably just irrational at best. \n\nI know Paige has had a hard time with mental health and other schooling and work issues this past month so I can\u2019t help think I\u2019m worrying for nothing. But deep down I think I\u2019m right for both cases. That they\u2019ve just grown tired of me. I really don\u2019t want to stop communication or the rps since I genuinely love writing with them and find them both to be friends. \n\nHowever I just feel exhausted whenever I even start to open the Discord app even more. I haven\u2019t even replied in weeks to anyone because I feel like they\u2019re cut off communication with me when they have the chance. I think some of my abandonment issues and anxiety/depression are clouding my opinion in both cases but honestly I\u2019m super tired and I know this isn\u2019t healthy for me. \n\nI\u2019m already sick enough as it. Both physically and mentally. I almost collapsed at a restaurant this evening. I feel selfish and constantly sick just even remotely thinking about it. I\u2019m considering quitting rp all together or just deleting my Discord and cutting off contact with everyone. But at the same time I enjoy talking with these people even more than I do with my current friends as sad as it is. Maybe I don\u2019t have any real friends haha. Maybe this is inevitable. Anyways sorry for the pity fest. It\u2019s late and I\u2019m tired. I just sometimes wish I never got into rping. It would of been a lot easier if I never liked writing in the first place.",

Still, what they're proposing doesn't sound like the kind of thing I want to do with this character because I don't exactly enjoy having their personality do a complete 180 from what it actually is, so I politely let them know.

I\u2019ve devoted at least 1,000+ hours to this shit and all I\u2019ve gotten was extra stress, anxiety, hours of restlessness, abandonment anxiety, crying for hours at end, external manipulation, callousness and have managed to completely fuck up my sleeping schedule. \n\nIt\u2019s like working for a job when all you receive is constant criticism, no appreciation, your parents insulting you for \u201cwasting your time,\u201d weird creeps always trying to get into your metaphorical pants, the coworkers you love disappearing and quitting without so much as a heads up, no pay, work-related stress and not even enjoying the work you loved so much before this all happened.

But, when we started rping, I was faced with literally the worst things. First, they didn't put punctuation, which made it so hard for me to understand that they meant. Second, they change scenes without warning me. Like if we are in the middle of a smut scene, they will just change it to an entirely different thing. It pisses me off so much. Last but not least, they often send responses to dialogues without description. For example, they send \"I love you too\" with nothing else. They often don't put quotation marks as well. Despite all these stuff, I don't have the heart to quit the rp, nor I want to block them.",

            "selftext": "This is something of an inquiry as well as a call out if you will. I am wondering what people going into an 18+ group rp expect from the mods running it. By this I mean in dealing with the people side of things not just keeping things up as running. This can be any form of group rp but mine has been a discord server. I know that there are rules for how one should behave and often there is a blacklist of topics to avoid or handle with care. There is also a difference between in character and out of character but what is okay or acceptable in character in a group setting? Am I expecting to much from mods running an rp? I ask this as someone who owns a group rp and runs it by the standards I expect from others. \n\nThis is important because the server I was in before has updated their information to include things like the following statements. I feel this is just lazy modding and an excuse to allow people they like to do things that are honestly not appropriate in a group setting. I do know one of the mods in that server does not believe triggers are a real thing. \nFrom their Tumblr page: \nOur mod team is dedicated to making your time within the server as great as we possibly can. We do our best to adapt to our members and work to have events to keep things engaging. We want to make sure needs are met and people are comfortable. However, we are human. We make mistakes and overlook things. We are more than willing to address that when it\u2019s realized. Just because we are in charge of the server does not mean we are held to a different standard than any other member-- we are not exempt from making mistakes.\nThat being said, when the mod team or anyone within the server makes someone uncomfortable or upset, we expect that this will be dealt with in a mature way. This is a mature server for adults. The mod team expects that members will have the level of maturity. If there is a problem, we ask that it be brought to the attention of one of the active mods privately-- which is expressly stated within our guidelines. We also expect that muns, if approached with notice that they have caused discomfort, will either adapt / seek advice for changing behavior or else step away.\nMembers need to know that problems might not be dealt with in the way the member may want. All decisions within this server are made with all four mods voices in mind (unless one of our number decides to abstain in potentially personal matters where we are unable to be unbiased). We will always ask for full evidence and try to see all sides of a matter, so please be aware that matters are never dropped without some form of resolution even if it's not displayed to the server as a whole. We do not see any point in putting any person in an uncomfortable display just to satisfy unnecessary apologies / gestures that are most often presented privately.\nThe mods are not here to teach anyone how to act appropriately in an adult environment. We expect members to be aware of our rules as well as our server-guide-to-success (viewable in server), which states expectations within the roleplay aspect. If our expectations are not ones you feel you can match, or ones you do not wish to manage, we kindly request you rethink applying to our server community. We are aware this is a more harsh approach than other servers. However, with our number of members and all that we have to do within the server, this is not something that the moderators should need to worry about. We are grateful for the loving and understanding community we have created and seek only to grow that in a positive manner.\n\nTheir blacklist rules:\nWhat is a trigger? An emotional trigger is anything \u2014 including memories, experiences, or events \u2014 that sparks an intense emotional reaction such as a panic attack. These are not things that cause small discomforts or things that are simply disliked. We ask members not misuse the use of this blacklist channel to prevent people from approaching topics just because they are disliked. We also do not allow blacklisting of characters, ships, or fandoms on the premise that this is an open-minded multifandom server.\nPlease note: Things like talk of alcohol / drugs, religious and cultural discussions, alcoholism, drug abuse, weaponry including guns, violence, age gaps within relationships, death, and potential general (non-specific) abuse may be mentioned in general due to the nature of pre-existing muses in the chat. Muses may also have negative attitudes and relate misogynistic, biased, or bigoted behavior that does not reflect the beliefs of the muns. If you are uncomfortable with any of these things, you may find yourself uncomfortable within our server.\nThings such as active non-consent, active incest (inclusive of step / adoptive siblings), and bestiality are not allowed in the server regardless of circumstance. We do not condone slurs such as the n-slur, f-slur, or other such racist / homophobic words in chat. Other curses, however, are allowed and do not need to be censored.\nIMPORTANT: While we do not ask for reasons or justifications PLEASE BE SPECIFIC to avoid any miscommunications!",

Been doing that for over a year, so I'd say I know the ropes pretty well. Before that, I helped to run a 30+ person zombie apoc server.\n\nIt's part of my hobby to seek out low-pop RP servers because they're easy to mess with. Now, before you click the downvote button, I only do it to people who deserve it. You may now click the downvote button.\n\nIn my quests, I have found a few quirks that are common in owners of low-pop (ten or less) servers. Now, I admit that RP isn't their day job. They're allowed to spend their time however they please, but I'm still gonna note a few things.\n\n1. Being lazy is hard: Owner complains about the lack of active users. Lore is literally 50 lines of text without punctuation or paragaphing. Changes to \"revamp\" the server includes making confusing things even more confusing.\n\nLore, even if readable, has plotholes the size of Jupiter. \"Company decides to nuke it's customer base because it threw a tantrum over protestors!\"\n\nLmao, yeah. Tell your shareholders how you're gonna profit from that.\n\n2. \"I'm more of a GM\": Owner refuses to make his/her own character sheet. Wonders why no one RPs with the owner.\n\nAlso refuses to GM anything.\n\n3. \"I TRIED NOTHING AND IT DOESN'T WORK!\": The player base ends up controlling the story due to the owner not giving any input to his/her admins. Endless ERP orgies ensue. This was on an apoc zombie server.\n\nOwner then quit.\n\n4. *Posts stale meme in response to serious question, wonders why people leave*\n\n5. Power Trip: Dead horse edition.\n\n6. Misplaced power trip: Ends up listening to \"that guy\" over you. Bans you because your (female) OC got raped. Claims to be a feminist. Only realizes mistake once it's too late.\n\n7. \"You're an admin now, make server work, pls\": An easy way to get trolled.\n\n8. Literal Child making an ERP server: FBI plant.\n\nNow, I get that an itemized list feels less geniune than an actual anecdote about each of these. Maybe I'll post a few stories later on, but I'm currently drinking.",

            "selftext": "It's happened so often lately that I feel compelled to vent. I like to role-play across a number of different fandoms and also forge original settings from time to time. I'm in the mood for sci-fi stories at times and fantasy stories on other occasions. \n\nYet it has become something of a trend where I will explicitly state that I am looking to do something in a fantasy setting only for a partner to try and gradually exploit the planning phase as a way to try and get me to shift the direction entirely.\n\nA recent example is that I wanted to play out a fairly standard story involving a pair of heroic knights who adventure together for gold and glory. I suggested that I'd be happy doing so in a dark and gritty fantasy setting in a similar vein to *The Witcher* or something more easy going like a *Final Fantasy* game.\n\nNow, I'm fine with flexibility to a degree. If someone asked if they could play, say, a dashing rogue instead of a knight than I'd be completely fine with that since the dynamic wouldn't change too much.\n\nInstead, an attempt was made to push the direction towards playing in a modern day setting with a pair of university age jocks in a locker room. I politely stated that I wasn't interested in such a dynamic (for that particular story, at least) and suggested that we stick to the fantasy backdrop.\n\nMy partner seemingly agreed to do so and I went ahead with my first post to establish my character as hanging around in an adventurer's guild awaiting payment for a successful quest. My partner then decided to write an entire multi-paragraph post introducing his character as stepping out of his apartment, lifting weights at the gym and...then hanging around in the locker room of the adventurer's guild in such a way as to portray it not as an actual fantasy setting, but a modern day one.\n\nI was baffled and stated that I believed we wouldn't be a good fit for one another after all. We parted ways and a few days later the guy approached me on a different account...attempting to push me into a very similar setup.\n\nPerhaps I've just been unlucky, but it seems to be a problem I encounter frequently lately. I'm pretty clearly about what I desire from a partner, I'm willing to compromise to a large degree and yet it seems like many role-players have no success with their own prompts and so decide to see if they can push people into doing what they want even if the proposal isn't anything remotely similar to their original request.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this?",

I don\u2019t know this this story really counts as a bad \u201crp story\u201d (some parts of it may) but if anything else I\u2019m the bad partner. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been roleplaying for at least around seven years at this point. I\u2019ve had the strange, the weird, the straight up manipulative and in some terms abusive, but I\u2019ve definitely had a lot of good partners. I\u2019ve posted a couple of times on here before, but I\u2019m definitely had my shares of losses of partners. However, for the past four years, I\u2019ve had a partner named Alex. \n\nAlthough we\u2019ve never met in person, I have to say Alex is one of my really good friends. We both share a lot in common and even had similar career/educational interests (pre-med but I\u2019ve since switched to pre-law). We have rped off and on these past four or so years but many times I\u2019ve felt myself drift away or take a lot of \u201cbreaks.\u201d However, we chat daily and I want our friendship to remain as strong as it currently is. It\u2019s not that their writing is terrible, it\u2019s the complete opposite. At first, they definitely were the better writer, but as time pasted in a weird way I\u2019ve felt that as I\u2019ve grown their writing level stagnated. I can\u2019t put it into words. Like I mentioned before they\u2019re definitely a pretty decent writer, but I think the more time has past the more issues I\u2019ve noticed. Sometimes they just tend to ignore parts of my response. Other times they provide replies that I have an extremely hard time to response too. There other little issues that annoy me more than they should. I definitely had my issues with writing but for the most part I\u2019ve managed to fix them. Alex well hasn\u2019t. \n\nThere are points when I\u2019m drawn back into the story and happily continue but I\u2019ve never happy for long. At the same time I feel awful. They often allow me to pick the genre or main the characters we both like the most but at the same time I\u2019m never satisfied. I\u2019ve been getting interested back again but my health problems have been preventing me from really getting back into it. I know eventually I\u2019ll also be bored but I just feel like I\u2019ve been stringing them along for too long. What should I do?",

            "selftext": "Hey everybody, I'm not sure that this whole situation makes my partner a bad rper, necessarily, but I know it's been frustrating me. I wanted to see if anyone's experienced similar things, or if anyone has any idea how to deal with this kind of situation.  \n\n\nSo, some background: this person and I have been roleplaying for 6 months, give or take, by now. We have a whole original world with an entire cast of characters. We each main about 8 characters each, and when we started we would rapid fire respond probably 10 times a day in each character's channel. It was a super active roleplay. We don't write much, it's literally a few sentences each response.  \n\n\nThe situation: About a month ago, my partner stopped responding except for once a night to one or two characters. They said sorry and mentioned that 'things have been happening.' We're fairly close and have talked about some pretty serious stuff in the past, so I don't know what's happening exactly but it seems a little out of character for it to be left unsaid. It's been over a month now, and I guess those things are still happening. Now, I get a response to one character every three days or longer. This is super frustrating because the responses are still really short. To be clear, I *love* short responses because they allow for rapid fire responses and quick reactions/storytelling. When you only get a short response once every week, it's torture. And, it's only one of the characters in the story. So, I'm waiting up to a week for one character of eight to get in *one line of dialogue.* And if I respond I know I'll have to wait an undetermined amount of time for that character to be revisited, if they even ever are. My favorite pair of our characters hasn't gotten any attention in the past month.  \n\n\nMy point is, I guess, it feels like some of these characters have been ghosted completely over this past month, despite all being a part of the same story. The other characters barely ever get responses. I've gotten no real communication about why this is happening or if it will ever go back to the way it was before. I know ghosting sucks, but at least you can come to the conclusion eventually that it's over and find closure for yourself. Right now, I feel like I'm stuck in this hellish limbo. Every few days, I get a response from this roleplay and instead of actually feeling like I'm engaging in the roleplay again, it feels like some painful reminder that I really miss this goddamn roleplay and it's barely clinging to life.   \n\n\nWhat do I do?? Should I confront my partner outright and ask if this is ever going to end? Do I just assume it won't, since it's been a whole ass month, and tell them it's over? Do I just give them the benefit of the doubt and try to ride this dry period out? Any advice would be helpful or just support. I've had this happen with other roleplays before, though rarely, and it always feels like the most drawn out, torturous way for a roleplay to die.",

To make matters worse, I've started skim-reading everything and it really takes a toll on my writing quality. I've taken clunky paragraphs and just tried to speed read over them so I can get a reply in the works quicker. None of my partners have complained and I've never told them I do this, but it becomes troublesome when I have to look back at past events because they might still be relevant in the current story and I find myself inwardly cringing because I hate reading what I write. It's not like the writing is bad per se, but more like I just think it is? I'm always doubting myself and nitpicking, and it is starting to become a vicious cycle. My partners deserve better because they write magnificent detailed replies, only for me to subconsciously skim through them in a scatter-brained haze.",

For the most part, they were great. But we should've known it was too good to be true. First, they'd put their characters in not so great situations far far away from where everyone else was, then get upset when no one came to their aid. They'd spam the ooc chat with song lyrics as one form of venting and get upset when we asked them to stop spamming (you should know that we didn't know they were venting, all we knew was that they were sending song lyrics in a chat while the rest of us were talking). They'd also vent normally in the ooc chat about incredibly triggering things. I asked them to move to the venting channel because, while I am not triggered by much, a lot of the other members got triggered easily. Of course, Aya refused. Claiming that things in the venting channels triggered them. I even made a venting channel specifically for them, but no, only the ooc chat was good enough for venting. At that point I was just worn out by them, so I blocked them. Then Aya went and complained to my friend Bunny, who came and asked me what happened. I explained to her, and she understood. We finally banned her from every server and everyone blocked her when the youngest person in our server (12 or 13 years old) came forward and told us that Aya, who was 19-21 years old, had been flirting with him.",

            "selftext": "So, a few years ago, I was roleplaying with a girl I met on Amino. The original rp we did died and, forgetting I even had active chats on there, I deleted the app. Literal YEARS (1.5-2 YEARS) passed and I get a random add on discord. This person managed to find me under a completely different name via discord and added me. At first, I was okay with it. Like, hey, my old partner is back. Maybe we can work something up again. \n\nI showed her my OCs that I'd put together since we'd last talked-- including a trio of demigod brothers who were based in Egyptian mythology. I knew from years ago this girl was catholic, but when she told me she wanted to set up a plot with my boys, I didn't think anything of it. I just figured she thought their backstory and mythos may be interesting. Boy was I wrong. \n\nI myself am a Kemetic pagan and she knew this (i suspect its part of the reason the old rp we had died off). We literally had played through about 8 responses a piece before her character started blatantly questioning my character and why his faith lied with \"dead gods\". I brushed it off the first time, letting my character explain that the gods of Egypt were still very much alive, just not as powerful due to lack of veneration. She then proceeded to go on about how \"people would worship them if they did good things for humanity like the God of Christians\". She-- in character-- was forcing her religion onto a character who was an actual DEMIGOD from the pantheon she was screaming was dead. I politely asked her to stop in our ooc chat because my faith is important to me and trying to disprove or bash it was hurtful. She followed up by trying to convert me there, too. Told me that there were \"miracles\" recorded in Christianity (Particularly Catholicism) that were \"backed by science and witnesses\". I swear, I'm not normally the ghosting type, but I literally set my discord to invisible for weeks before i finally worked up the courage to block her after she kept sending me links to \"miracles proven by science\". Yeah... I don't feel bad about ghosting on that one.",
