I was hoping to get some advice from you wonderful people since I\u2019ve seen how wise/knowledgeable the community is in their craft! \n\nI\u2019m sure this is a topic people can relate to, but lately I\u2019ve had an idea floating in my head that I really, really want to do. I know the universe, characters. Have a flushed out original of my own. I\u2019m so ready. The only problem? Crickets. I can\u2019t seem to find a soul, despite always having great luck in the past with said concept. I even try to make it broad and open to expand upon. Maybe I\u2019m not looking in the right places? \n\nI guess my question is, have you ever wanted to roleplay something extremely specific? And if so, how did you find partners/cope if you couldn\u2019t? I\u2019d really appreciate some insight, as I\u2019m starting to feel stuck. Thank you!!\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Some months ago, I started a roleplay up with this girl that came to me from one of my ads. I typically don't have a 'post size' requirement, however on my ads I will either include my word count averages or provide samples so that people can come to their own conclusion on if they think we are compatible before writing with me.\n\nThis girl, if I remember correctly, implied she mirrored post sizes. At the time, I thought this was fine. I'm not a stickler for post sizes, just as long as the story moves along at an enjoyable pace. I personally enjoy writing and can easily get into 500-1000 word posts without even thinking about it, and if someone feels the need to match that, it's no problem for me... Until writing with this girl, anyway.\n\nHoly run on sentences did this chick change my opinions on 'mirroring post sizes'. I was going on with my usual averages, writing what I felt like at the time, and she was actually matching my post sizes. But hot damn, were her posts filled with \"filler, filler, filler\". Just random sentences slapped into places with entirely unimportant information, or repeating information within the exact same sentence. Run on sentences constantly, and just overall poorly structured paragraphs that made little sense to me. (I think she may have been mirroring how I structured my paragraphs? I usually do many smaller sized paragraphs, rather than a few very meaty paragraphs. But it felt like she was just mimicking the sizes of mine without paying attention to content). Lastly, her character dialogue was just super stilted.\n\nI feel bad harping on this girl like this. I'm not claiming to be the best writer, and I don't expect my partners to be either... I think this was just the first experience I've had with so many issues delivered in 'decently' sized posts. This may be one of the few instances where I personally think it would have been way easier to digest if these posts were delivered in a smaller format... If anything, so the errors would feel more far apart, or to just take out the needless filler.\n\nNow for the \"Am I an asshole?\" segment:\n\nFrom my OOC interaction with this girl, she honestly came off as pretty whiny. Not to say I'm against some occasional venting sessions with partners. I felt we weren't really *close* enough for that, so a lot of that whining behavior just made me feel pretty awkward. (example: while casually chatting, I mentioned how me and my SO(now husband) wanted to have a baby before we're 30, and her response was \"well I'm 30, and I haven't even had a real boyfriend yet\"). With the whining, and awkwardness, I really just felt like we didn't have compatible personalities on top of incompatible writing. She claimed she was 30, but I felt like I was talking to a teenager. I just wasn't super comfortable and wasn't enjoying the roleplay... So, I cut it off.\n\nWell, thinking back, the WAY I cut it off was probably a bit harsh. I sent her a PM explaining how it really wasn't anything personal, but I just don't think our writing meshed well. I was trying to be as cordial as possible, while explaining that I don't think there was anyway it was going to work... Aaaand then I blocked her so that she wouldn't be able to respond. The site of which we communicated on will let a blocked person read the message sent, but won't let them respond, basically.\n\nWas me blocking kind of a dick move? At the time, just judging from our OOC interactions, I just wasn't looking forward to a respond to my 'break up' message. I honestly DON'T block people unless they are actually creepy or inappropriate with me, but in this case I just really, really did not want to hear a response. But after seeing some posts on this sub where people have had negative experiences with other people blocking them out of the blue, it made me actually kind of reflect on this experience a bit.",

That being said, if you have comments on your ad and messages in your inbox and none of them, not even one, come close to meeting your standards, you might have an issue. Lately I've come across people who make new posts of their same ad weekly and I've seen that they are getting responses, but its seems like no one is good enough for them. Also they state that you need \"perfect grammar and sentence structure\" (because they're an English major), yet their ad has many mistakes. I'm just ranting but I'm so over the elitism in this hobby. Just because you write 10k word responses and spit out words like a thesaurus doesn't make your writing good. 9 times out of 10 writing with people like that is horrible and the plot goes no where as they are too focused on their \"perfect\" writing.",

Things were great, we both put detail and work into our responses, and we both communicated fairly well.

That\u2019s perfectly understandable, work is work. I\u2019m not going to interrupt someone\u2019s job over a story. I quickly noticed that this partner was online just about all the time now. When we were roleplaying he was barely online. This was on discord so they could have changed their status to invisible but I just don\u2019t know.

            "selftext": "Hey there, so this is a mix of a self-realization of ignorance as well as a general inquiry to what flavors people crave these days. Repeating that in English, I'm not sure what kind of roles and ideas these days inspire people to say yes to a prompt. We've all been there I think in reading Mr. Railroad's intricate plot that allows no deviation or creative freedom, basically something that sounds neat to read but offers no fun in actually role-playing.\n\nI don't think I'm that bad but I'd like to make some pre-emptive measures to avoid that. For context I've for the last decade always done original role-plays that take some inspiration from other works of fiction with original characters ( sometimes fandoms with original characters but never canon ones, that whole fetish never clicked with me ). Usually my ideas for these take a bit of work from both sides, luckily my innate knack for storycrafting does help alleviate much of the heavy lifting. That said, while my stories are at the least I'd consider interesting, I've been questioning lately if they are offer a firm enough enticement to prospective partners.\n\nAs a quick side note, a lot of my plots do not rely on romance as the main theme. I usually find it too easy ( and too forced ) as a basis for a solid role-play. I feel the lack of focus on it forces a reliance on character motives and objectives, as well as other variables, outside the realm of star crossed lovers or fated love. I'm not against the theme mind you, I just prefer such as a natural occurrence while the RP is poppin'.\n\nThat all said and done, my purpose for this post is to find out from all you lovely role-players and writers what in particular about plots, pairings, and general role-play ideas entice you? I know it's broad question in itself and I'll get quite a few different answers ( at least I think so ), but I do believe it might help me figure out how to better structure my ideas and get 'em off the shelves faster.\n\nSo basically, what do you look for and what inspires you to want to write when it comes to proposed plots and pairings? Especially when it comes to proposed roles? Bonus points for mentioning things related to medieval fantasy centric role-plays but again I'd love all different kinds of answers.\n\nThanks for your time!",

            "selftext": "So on this sub we\u2019re used to talking about our experiencers *with* bad rpers, both IC and OOC, but I thought it might be fun to share *our own* cringe moments that almost inevitably come up over years of roleplaying. Especially if you started in your teens, I know you must have something!\n\nI did think about adding the posts where possible, but I don\u2019t want to doxx myself either, so I\u2019m afraid not. Anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Wannabe wolfaboo**\n\nI was 11 or 12 and on neopets, so. You know. Wolf roleplays. I didn't get why anyone wanted to read or write about humans when you could imagine being a wolf instead. I dived into my first ever rp as a lone female wolf. Not knowing what to post for an intro, when finally prompted to contribute, I don't type out a paragraph like the others, just enter \u201cAWOOOOOOOOO\u201d and then spend the rest of the rp with my character not interacting but pining for attention (she was starving so, I figured that would make people pity her \u2013 no). I\u2019m pretty sure the GM thought I was a troll, yet they only gave me a couple of warnings. I still managed to have fun, but can\u2019t say if they did.  \nNiche cringe bonus: so much \"wolf speak\". If you know, you know. Orbs, pillars, banners, auds etc. I wasn\u2019t a wolfaboo, but I definitely thought wolfaboos were the cool kids and I wanted to be \u201cin\u201d with them so badly.  \nOn a side note, I was paranoid about how *baaaad* I was being for using the neoboards while not yet being 13 years old which was the required age. I'd write diary entries about how guilty I felt for pretending to be my older sister when making a neopets account and I'd leave these dramatic confessions laying around, hoping my mum would find them and tell me it's okay.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. PP, GM, just bad fights all around**\n\nBattle colosseum type threads were a staple of mine. Littered with \u201che was taller than the other dragon\u201d, \u201che easily dodged every attack\u201d and \u201che tore his throat open\u201d. Funnily enough, I learned this was bad rping when someone equally unaware did the same to me and I found it annoying as hell. Tiny bad in the end, tbh.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. I had no idea what I was doing at the time**\n\nHas anyone else reflected on how *intensely awkward* it must have been for the neo moderators to read all the children posting quasi-D/s themes on the rping sub CONSTANTLY?   \nI\u2019m thinking of all the \u201cgifted sold to rich\u201d, \u201cDNA-injected teens breaking out of lab\u201d, \u201cmythical creature market\u201d threads you would see. Mind you, almost nothing ever developed in these since everyone just wanted to be emo in a cage, including *me*. The people playing the \u201crich\u201d, \u201cscientist\u201d, or \u201cbuyer\u201d types were always in demand and there was this weird shipping dimension to it with enforced M-F ratios and pairing off.   \nObviously we were getting banned all the time for posting this stuff, and we'd then openly discuss *on the neoboards* about what \"triggered the filter\" this time and how to avoid it, to no avail.  \n(It was only a good number of years later I realised I had been kinking around all along.)  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Bad acting**\n\nSo at some point in my teens I read Uglies/Pretties/Specials, my first dystopian and YA books. The ideas were sooooo cool to me and this bled **directly** into my rps.   \nSomeone on my neoboard asked if I had taken the major ideas and plot from the third book, answer: yes.   \nI lied and said \u201cno, I\u2019ve never read them\u201d (I was super embarrassed they had noticed so easily), they politely recommended them to me and said nothing else about it. But then I felt really bad about lying to them, so I waited a little before pretending to \u201csuddenly remember\u201d reading the third book, and I went into a whole pantomime between IC posts with OOC of \u201cOh wow, I actually still have a copy.\" \\[it was still on loan from the school library and I had finished reading it like, a day earlier\\] \"Hey I\u2019m just reading the first chapter and\u2026wow, you\u2019re right, this rp is sooo like that, what a coincidence. Wow.\u201d  \nImmediately felt like a fool for doing this one, lesson learned.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. \u201cDon\u2019t cut yourself on that edge\u201d**\n\nI think I was reading \u201cThe Knife of Never Letting Go\u201d and picked up a severe ellipse abuse habit along with some experimental paragraphing ideas. I meted this out on my forum members while writing in black font on a dark red background about my latest grimdark character, named after a monster I had in \u201cmonster rancher 2\u201d when I was 8 years old. Said character was nearly always torturing someone, and this was during my \u201cwow I\u2019m so into psychology\u201d phase, so yes, they were The Sharpest Edge in the Room.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Wait that\u2019s a bit too deep for today**\n\nI guess this one is sad more than cringe, but you\u2019ve probably heard of /r/menwritingwomen, right? Despite me being a female writer, that has been me so uh, /r/womenwritingwomen? I could NOT do female characters for a long time \u2013 I rp\u2019d males mainly (it was easier to get attention) and so when I did write women, in hindsight, it was bizarrely misogynistic in how shallow the characters were, and they pretty much only existed to be horny and get with a guy\u2026like, I couldn\u2019t think of what to put into their aspirations or personalities. Fortunately, this came to an end as I \"found myself\".  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7. I aim to please, I miss completely**\n\nI had a good rp partner some years ago (I was about 22 or 23) and had been advertising for a dystopian type rp, but she was way more into milsim. I reluctantly went along with her ideas and spent many posts dithering outside of the \u201creal action\u201d of the plot and got called out on my clich\u00e9 scene descriptions. Frankly, even now, I still have no clue how anything \u201cworks\u201d in a modern military operation to make the scenes plausible. It's not a genre I ever cared to watch or read in, and this rp massively put me off anything more. My partner wasn\u2019t even rude, she just sorta stopped replying despite us talking OOC and I knew. \n\nWe spoke about it months later, I said \u201cyeah I really am not strong in that area\u201d and she just kind of\u2026agreed without saying anything else. Pain, pain, pain.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. I will never know exactly how much they know**\n\nAnd finally, some brief only-OOC cringe. The True Fucking Horror\u2122 of a family friend using the PC when I\u2019d left a tab in my forum and them seeing all my shitty ellipse-abusing posts and power fantasies. What's even worse is they made me aware that they knew what I was up to, but they wouldn't say *exactly how much they knew*, just sort of, grinned.\n\nI was old enough by this point (about 17) for the content of said prose to be *quite much and very NSFW*. This one still hurts sometimes. I still see this person IRL. Ugh.",

            "selftext": "So, I started a rp with someone a few weeks ago, they found my thread off of Gaia and I thought it was going fairly well. I'm a big plotter, give me headcanons, pictures or gifs that may remind you of a pairing at random, I don't want us to write ourselves into a hole that we can't get out of because we struggled to plan ahead. I just want us to have direction..  They wrote well, *really* well compared to others I've partnered with. I enjoyed it, I shared some stuff in ooc, we got some laughs and we had a little bit of back and forth. We didn't get too far though, about 19 pages in word, enough to understand the characters and get kinda invested but not far story wise...\n\nIt had a soulmate trope to it that I've been dabbling with finally after years of just not. Their character struggled to converse with mine because of species differences and usually going off of body languages and the like. There wasn't a language barrier, they were just stoic and found conversing awkward. My character enjoys the mental stimulation of an engaging conversation since she's on the witty and snarky side so it was tricky to write. I noticed their second conversation dialogue wise started slipping where they explained what the draw to each other was.\n\n It continued to feel more awkward so I asked I think twice if they had any input on what we could do to give them something that would keep them both engaged so the posts wouldn't lack because I wanted them to enjoy what we were doing.  They finally dropped a message today that they didn't think we were a good match . It was fun for a bit but they just weren't feeling it. They transferred ownership to the discord server to me, left and unfriended me before I could reply. \n\nI had just gotten their message and went to ask what we could have done to improve it for them despite asking the same thing just yesterday and I think a few days back but worded differently. Is there a 'good' way to get ghosted?",

            "selftext": "This is mostly a response to the novella-vs-shortposting debate that people keep having. The argument from the side of both is that when you're reading a book you are gonna get a lot of descriptive information. You're going to get paragraphs of setting information, or in like, GRRM's case, food. That's true. You are going to get that kind of information. But I gotta tell you guys something.\n\nRPs aren't books.\n\nThe flow and writing conventions for a traditional novel are very different from that of an RP, and a typical RP would not stand up to being translated to book format because of this. There is typically a flow between fast, punchy dialogue that might only be one line per character and a good few paragraphs or even pages of sensory information.\n\nAnyone who claims longposting is better because 'that's how books are written' has no idea what they are talking about, I'm sorry. And before you all come after me, I've got several ghostwritten projects, several published short stories, too many articles to count, and four full-length novels to my name that were very popular where they were made available. I know how to write a book. \n\nTo add to this, shortposters are not lazy, uneducated, stupid, or 'on a lower level' than you. I have all those writing accolades...guess what? I'm not a novella writer. I don't think novella writing is good writing 90% of the time. There are a few people I write with who are typically novella writers who are fantastic writers who really have a flair and talent for description and ambiance. I adore these people.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe majority of those who demand 1k-2k words per post have never heard what purple prose is before and are padding wordcount whether they realize it or not. I have written whole-ass book chapters that are not 2000 words long. There's a such thing as taking the meaning of your piece and burying it under flowery language, and it's not good writing in a book, either.\n\nI said what I said.",

I've considered writing full-length novella posts for an RP before. I've tried it, even. I've tried really hard, actually!  \n\n\nI just...can't do it, man. The constant pressure to type 1000+ words at a time really floors me and no matter what I try it just doesn't get any better. Inevitably my post length dwindles until I'm consistently writing 250-300 words, 4-5 paragraphs, whatever. If there's an emotional high I can really get going, but that doesn't happen very often for me and it really only happens when another author brings out my best.   \n\n\nIs writing description a weak point for me? Hellll yeah. I've been told this repeatedly and I've tried to fix it and I don't know, man.

Either that or you try too hard to be \u201cmain character\u201d material. \n\n3. Your view on roleplaying and usage has morphed into something unhealthy \n(IE.

Your standards for rp plots and partners are too high. 300 min words, 10 paragraphs, have to be rapid fast replies, etc. The plot has to go exactly how you envisioned it to go down or it's ruined. \n\n5. You get called or call yourself an rp elitist. \n\n(4.5) 6. Your standards are too high that people are afraid or feel intimidated roleplaying with you. This will mean you'll have a harder time finding partners. You would think this will guarantee you more quality role plays but you'll be ghosted or have ghosted people a lot more than you think. \n\n7. You're very critical of other people's writing, story-making, and characters. It's fine to challenge and question things in the roleplay, that's how they'll improve but it's to the point you complain almost anything about the rp. You often think how if you created the rp yourself it would be so much better. \n\n8. You like to rush through things and \u201cget to the point\u201d without any consideration for your partner/group. You get inpatient ooc. As soon as the subplot pertains to your characters you take your sweet time. Most likely to force things onto your partner(s) without their consent (romance and or smut).\n\n9. You have to justify your Mary Sue/Gary Stu tendencies (powerplay, metagame, godmod) that they do the things that they do now to develop the plot. \n\n10. Someone asks you \u201cwhy don't you just write your own stories?\u201d. They might think (wow why haven't I?). Maybe these people have written their own stories but they have no one to validate their creations. This last reason is mostly why some people who have done or thought about the above rp. It's the immersion aspect. Writing and being in a different world. It's a feeling that's hard to get when you create your own stories. So you rp but it's for your self-interest but unfortunately, that's not what roleplaying is for.\n\nRoleplaying is a collaborative effort. It requires communication and a healthy happy mindset to do. If you roleplay to make *your* life better and alive to fulfill your needs it only goes downhill from there. Stories are a solo effort but you can still get immersed in those. You can do whatever you want in those. Just take your imagination and see where it goes, unless you're planning on posting your stories no one can tell you what you write is bad or good cause you wrote it thinking about what you wanted in a story.",

First time an argument broke out, I was told I am just toying with this person. \n\nWhen I don't toy with anyone like that, so I tried to defuse the situation, was eventually successful and things seemed to be normal again. \n\nAbout two or three days ago, said Bad Experience 1 asked to rp, I couldn't because I was playing Destiny 2. I couldn't reply right away again. They asked again and I just brought up that they are very excited to rp everyday. \n\nSo they asked if it was a bad thing, I couldn't reply because I was doing something. Then asked if it was terrible thing. I said \"well no, you just come off as a very excited teen. Like it's all you ever do.\" \"Nothing terrible just shocked by how much you rather rp than anything else\"\n\nBad Experience 1 said \"ok, I just like rp\" \"So can we?\" \"Please\"\n\nI wrote \"I understand but I don't mind having days off from rp too.\" Could I have worded it better? Yeah because sometimes I type too fast and don't check. But that ultimately lead to Bad Experience 1 being upset with me and now after today, calling me mean, saying I think women is wrong (Mind you, I never mentioned anything about anyone being wrong or women at all. So I'm confused more than anything).\n\nBut in seriousness, did I do something wrong here? Because I did want an rp partner, I never do anything to upset another person and yet it turned hostile, when I just wanted some days of not rping.",

            "selftext": "So this one happened about a year ago, but it was a note worthy interaction that stuck with me. \n\nSmall Trigger Warning as I do mention abusive relationships, although it's 100% in the context of fiction/roleplay.\n\nI had a search thread going which included a word bank of things of interest I sometimes like included in a story, or for character dynamics. Some of them I'll admit could be a little 'risque' in nature, or crossing some lines, but personally I don't think any of them were terribly off-color. Well, this guy comes with me and some of the hits off my word bank were \"love triangles, age-gaps, love/hate dynamics, jealousy, and horror\".\n\nHis sent me a pitch that honestly wasn't *crazy* bad. He had my interest a little bit. Something involving a couple in a sort of troubled relationship. A very \"hot/cold\" boyfriend (his character), who kind of throws the girlfriend back and forth emotionally into something that may eventually develop into a sort of psychological horror and abusive relationship. I liked the psychological horror route honestly, because that's just my cup. BUT, homeboy then adds into his pitch,\n\n\"Her mother could be part of the storyline if you were wanting a triangle situation.\"\n\nNope. Nope nope nope. DEFINITELY not my cup lol. I'm down with (legal)age gaps, and love triangles, but I'm not into a love triangle in which a parent of one of the characters is directly within that triangle. Just not my thing. But, this wasn't a \"deal breaker\". I just told him straight up, \"I'm leaning against involving the mother being directly in the mix of things. At least, not for the love triangle aspect or her being involved with y/c.\" Something like that.\n\nSo, we're continuing our discussion, and up until this point, I kind of assumed our characters would be... Y'know, adults. I'm almost 30, so unless the plot seems specifically catered towards like highschool (which I don't really like highschool settings anyway), or something where having teenagers as our main characters makes the most sense, I prefer playing adults. And the scenario of a  psychological abusive relationship sounded very much like an ADULT setting-- But apparently *not*. As we're discussing things, it seems he was under the impression that these were teenagers, living with their parents...\n\nWell, considering he kind of insinuated before he wanted his character to boink my character's mom (lol), I was like... \"Yeah, I'm thinking they should be grown adults. And I think if she's stuck in abusive relationship, maybe it would make things a bit more tense if she's isolated and living *away* from her family?\" Really at this point, I'm just trying real hard to keep my character's mother just OUT of this story by this point. Because he keeps mentioning the parents, and the parents not liking his character, and all I'm thinking is about how it feels like he's pressing for this love triangle with the mom...\n\nSo I press it one final time like, \"I just don't want to fool with the parents. I think it would just be easier and make the most sense to the story if they're adults and don't have to fuddle with the parents. It seems unimportant to keep mentioning them.\"\n\nThis guy deadass responds with, \"I think I need to take a break from this discussion and think things over a bit. You keep on bringing up the parents and it seems like that is just getting too much focus.\"\n\nOh boy, I thought I was going to have a fucking amorism. Like YOU keep mentioning the parents. I want to play grown adults. Felt like he was just kept trying to weasel in ways to boink the mom, then finally got upset over the matter whenever I kept trying to move things away from that direction.\n\nNeedless to say, we did not continue into the roleplay. Pretty sure I told him off that he seemed real obsessed with them being teenaged and the parents were involved.",

You can\u2019t wait for me to write a bit of fucking story first? \n\nAlso this guy just straight up decided to skip to a dinner scene when I wanted to do a wrestling scene and I told him not to and I had to refuse to let him skip\n\nI also warned him I would do this and he still tried to get a sex scene going so I said goodbye to him and called him a \u201chorny incel prick\u201d and so far he hasn\u2019t responded \n\nAll in all. Not the best time",

            "selftext": "I joined a roleplay group filled with other artist/writers like myself. I stayed for months and experienced a lot of different problems. So while I am talking about one of them in detail. There was quite a bit of favoritism, members ignoring each other except the ones they like, gossip, and ship chasing. (The last happened to me especially. To the point where people would say very sexual and uncomfortable things about my character and when I did not reciprocate they would distance themselves from me or ignore me.)\n\nOne of the more difficult and hard to ignore issues was character imitation. I would not say my character was the most unique out of the entire bunch. Certainly they had some traits that were common but I did notice that they stood out in some shape or form. However, after joining I noticed there was quite a few characters that were being made that had some striking resemblance to mine. I would say three? They imitated hair/eye color, general color scheme, and distinct facial features. Such as beauty marks, freckles, or facial markings in exact same location. So in a combination it was a bit uncomfortable for me. (One even almost had a copy paste of my characters written profile in terms of personality/interest.) The reason this bothered me so greatly was more that I myself was ignored, or treated very awkwardly, but those who designed these characters experienced love and support by fellow members. (While this was mainly friends, and I am very aware I am a quiet person. It stung quite a bit.)\n\nI did not at first get uncomfortable. I tried to tell myself that it was just going to happen and it is okay. However, it started to really stress me out. I did seek some outward advice to ask friends/family (who tend to be honest with me.) Most looked over my artwork and the others and said they noticed a big amount of similarities. Though they expressed from what they saw of the artwork in the group. They felt that since I was above average in artistic skill of the average member that I should expect this.  I would not say I was the best in there by a long shot, but I try not to downplay how far I have come with this skill. Yet I am a little too afraid to post my art frequently due to my own issues.\n\nI have plans to ask other artist/rpyers about how they feel over the matter and give them the examples. To make sure I get a completely unbiased answer, but I did come here today to ask if this is something others experience and if it is a common concern? From what I have seen of others social media that I follow that this is something that is somewhat frowned upon as it hurts the artist who this is done too. **I do ask if you disagree to please be polite and respectful about it. As I have decided to leave the group explaining something else entirely. I have not attacked anyone. No one is aware about my reason for leaving aside from those closest to me. Even if I am wrong in how I feel there were other reasons that pushed me into making this decision not this alone.**",

            "selftext": "I have seen a few posts on this and thought I'd give a few tips that have worked for me for when someone takes my having rejected them badly. Let's say you put out an RP ad, someone picked it up, you've been writing with them awhile and things are just. not. working.\n\nYou go to them to say hey, I'm sorry. This isn't working out and I need to end the RP. They freak out at you. Here are some things that you can do:\n\n**Do not try to justify, argue, defend, or explain your choice.**\n\nYou don't actually need to justify why you want to end the RP, especially if someone is being rude to you. The only thing that matters from your perspective is that the RP is done, and adding in justifications or explanations is likely to just make them come back at you more. The best way to move forward is to reiterate that you appreciate their time, but the RP is done now.\n\n**Ask them to respect your boundaries.**\n\nTell them that they are not respecting your boundaries. 'I don't want to RP with you anymore' is a boundary. It's okay to have to restate it.\n\n**If they don't listen, block them.**\n\nIt's okay to hit that block button. You don't owe anyone your time or attention and if you attempted to be nice and they still lost their shit on you, that's on them, not you.\n\n**What if the person talks about me behind my back and it's harder to get partners?**\n\nThe community is huge. This is very unlikely to happen. Even if it does, for the most part people who are worth RPing with will see through them. These are usually online-only interactions, there's really nothing to be lost from just not communicating with that person anymore.\n\n**What if they start harassing me?**\n\nBlock them and report them. Fortunately this does not happen very often. \n\n**The TL;DR is that once again, it's okay to have boundaries.**\n\nYou don't owe anyone an RP and don't need to justify, argue, defend, or try to explain your choices. If you are certain you no longer want to RP, it's on them to accept it.  \n\n\nhope this helps!",

This has happened to me several times now and it's reached a point where if I know I have to I have a sense of dread because there is a solid chance the person is going to react like a child.  \n\n\nFor reference, I never insult anyone's ideas, work, characters, or anything. If I feel something isn't for me, I just say \"Hey I'm not sure this idea is going to work for me.\" or \"I'm not sure we're going to be too compatible.\" and give a best of luck. Because I don't want to waste anyone's time for something I'm not into, right?  \n\n\nAnd at least half the time, sometimes *more often than that, even,* I'll get a \"whatever\" or \"You reached out to ME\" or something really snarky or backhanded. Like first off, yes I reached out to you because that's how you gauge whether or not you're into something to get it off the ground. Sometimes not all the information you need is included in the advertisement. So you can decide whether or not this is going to work. Reaching out to someone isn't automatically the green light that this is actually going to happen.   \n\n\nIt's so frustrating. Yes, I know it's probably a sign I dodged a bullet not RPing with them if they behave that way. But it still doesn't feel good to basically be treated poorly for communicating.  \n\n\nGhosting is a problem and a lot of times it happens for no good reason, but please treat the people who ARE communicating well.

            "selftext": "I don't know if there's coming back from this or not. Imagine if your characters were partaking in nsfw activity and out of no where, without prior communication, theirs started thinking 'I don't want to do this' and acting hesitant/forced. You'd be mortified, right? You'd feel like your character was suddenly turned into an abuser, right? That's what this felt like. Please, feel free to tell me if I'm being overly sensitive in the comments, I do genuinely want to know if I was in the wrong here because this one really hurt me.  \n\n\nMy character (V) was a vampire, theirs a human. (H). V demanded that H teach them how to be more human. At first, yes, V was making this \\*demand\\*. However, after a little while, V learned that H had taken them away from their home, their life, and felt horribly about it. V had a tearful apology, H forgave them, because they were already in love at this point. This was all planned, communicated- yay our characters are in love and V has learned how important it is to consider others, whee.   \n\n\nThen V is called to a quest to prove Dracula is dead. The adventure awaits! Naturally, H is going to join V, right? Well, yes, that's what we'd planned on (obviously)...but H is hesitant. In fact, H has been hesitant \\*every single time\\* our characters have to do something. And sure, H is a recluse, but it was getting on my nerves that I felt like V had to spend several hours just getting H to move to make plot happen. There's being a recluse, but there's being scared of everything. Sure, H had good reasons, but being \\*this\\* scared in an \\*adventure\\* rp wasn't working out. I kept hoping it would get better. My partner kept telling me they'd get better.  \n\n\nInstead, it got so, so much worse. When V asked H to join them, H had a ton of inner thoughts about how they hated this. How they were only doing any of this for V because they couldn't be alone. About how they were forced into it. Comparing V with their abusive, forceful mother. And then their character just said 'yeah, I'll go.'  \nI was so hurt. My character had come so far, and now it was like they wanted him to be in a coercing, abusive role when we'd agreed they would go on this adventure together. Consent is so, so important to me for many, many personal reasons. V had grown into a person that cared and respected H and told him 'I won't make you do this', yet H kept thinking 'just suck it up and do it for him' kinda attitude. It simultaneously irritated me to have to pull teeth to move the plot, and it just hurt because I considered this rper a friend.  \n\n\nI told them I needed space and they're respecting that but I mean...am I being overly sensitive? I explained why this hurt me, but I don't know if they really get it.",

            "selftext": "The story could be a bit long. So I have decided to try and compile it the best way I can. Making it short and sweet as possible. I joined a roleplay server for artist/writers. I designed a character with specific design/personality traits to stand out. (Though I know there will be instances where I cannot always be incredibly unique which I respect and understand.)\n\nAfter some time of being there I noticed a couple characters came out with similar appearances to mine. The reason I noticed this was I put specific color schemes, appearance traits, and more for my specific character. (Things like hair colors, facial paint decorations, and etc.) I also did try to seek outside advice to see of others not within the community to ask if they felt there were glaring similarities. I was told by multiple people that 'yes' They felt there was some heavy 'inspiration' from my design. Though they also stressed that since I my skill was 'above average' of most of the other roleplayers within the group that it was probably due to that. I tried to take it as a compliment but felt that I was struggling. I have heard this is commonly frowned upon in these communities but most people don't say anything till they have to go through the same thing. (Also these characters were all brand new after I had joined so it was not a coincidence which I am aware happens.)\n\nI just wonder if it is normal to be upset by this as a roleplayer or is a common ground? I question if maybe I should not invest in doing this hobby? **Also this is just internal feelings. I never confronted or accused anyone of this. I kept it to myself as I am not the type to leap into action without sorting things out first.**",

Now I didn't need to look long to find something that seemed fun. I talked with the guy, discussed some stuff that would happen and got to it. I gave about a two paragraph response after he sent the starter and next thing I see is a response from him that's at least half. I thought \"ehh, probably a fluke. Maybe didn't know what to put, I'll  let it slide.\" Each response I got was the exact same length from him and after a while I basically asked \"Hey, can you possibly make your responses longer?\" To which he said \"sure.\" He didn't and I basically ghosted him out of frustrated. It's probably a dumb reason to drop an rp, but I just couldn't stand it anymore.",

Is purple prose abundant among novella writers? Probably so. Do people write long posts where nothing really happens? Yes. But even if so, live and let live. A longposter isn't an elitist by default.  \n\n\nI agree some people relentlessly mock short posts only because they are short, with no regard as to whether they have substance or not, but all the same, trying form a contr-elistist movement isn't something I personally see as a good way to go.  \n\n\nOnce again: live and let live. If you see and ad where the average length of posts someone wants definitely does not coincide with yours, then just... leave that person be! Simple as that. And if you see that someone labels themselves as advanced literate or is a straight up novella writer then don't be upset when they are dissatisfied with getting a short reply. Just make sure you have talked through your preferences before you go through with a roleplay, and if the other person disagrees with you on an element you see as vital, then just... just give up.

As a novella rper, I \\*want\\* to read those things; tell me all about how your character is perceiving the situation.  In your intros, tell me how you got here.  I'll reply with my character's own perception, respond to an expression or gesture that may be implied by such things.  Tell me about the details in the scene you're imagining and how it might direct the rp or what it might say about your character.  Maybe my character will notice or interact with it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a story is interesting, it contains all these things.  If you're reading a book, it'd certainly feel empty if it didn't have these things.  A rp is collaborative story-telling, so of course you'd want it to read like a properly written story.  Of course, this is without considering all other directly interactable elements like dialogue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been disappointed so many times by partners who seemed to have so much to offer in initial talking and planning only to not be descriptive about the things I would have loved for them to be descriptive about.  It takes the wind out of my sails immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your partner is descriptive but somehow manages to write nothing for you to reply to, they may just not be as good a writer as their length makes them appear.  That, or maybe just don't write with posters above your level, because you may not know \\*how\\* to properly pick up what they're putting down.  In the upper echelons of post length, not everything needs to be a direct interaction for the partner to respond to it - although of course there need to be direct interactions present.  If your partner isn't writing those at all, then they're a bad writer.  But only direct interactions with nothing else is bland and boring.  You wouldn't want to read a book like that, so why would you want to write a story like that?",

I've gotten some great things this way, including an obscure fandom RP for a fandom I happen to be very into that I never get to RP (I almost never do fandoms).   \n\n\nI've also gotten a few people wailing and gnashing teeth that I didn't pick up their idea. I'm not sure what about my post implied I was going to take every plot that was presented, regardless of whether or not it interested me. I also don't recall stating in my ad that I would take your weird ERP, your fully fleshed out universe I am not really that engaged with, or that I would do not-my-favorite-pairing based on what my ad said.\n\nThis community frustrates the hell out of me sometimes.",

            "selftext": "Maybe I just need to vent, but here is a synopsis of my most recent \"It's not me, it's you\" encounters.\n\nI recently started a few roleplays with whom I value to be very good writers. I thought most scenes were going well and was enjoying my time. Somewhat out of the blue, I received two messages. They were separate and from two of my RP partners. 'Yay!' I thought. 'Replies!'\n\nNo. Indeed it wasn't.\n\nTo my surprise and disappointment, both partners expressed a disinterest in roleplaying with me any further. Fine, that's not so bad. I've had to let people down before myself. Sometimes you just don't click.\n\nWhat sucked, and what continues to nag at me, is that they both made fairly blunt complaints that they didn't like how I write. It wasn't quite up to their standards. Ouch.\n\nI was confused, especially because I had supplied one of them with an extensive writing sample before we agreed to rp. To my knowledge I had thus far been able to match their post length, language, and attention to detail. So I wasn't sure what they were referring to.\n\nThen I replied, \"I'm very sorry to hear that. Could you tell me what it is you don't like? Perhaps your critique might help me improve for the future.\"\n\nNothing. I received only silence and after an hour or so I was blocked by both of them. \n\nIt's left me a bit down, and to be honest it's led me to be a bit neglectful of the other couple RPs I began because I just feel inferior. Wah wah poor me and all that.\n\nTl;dr: Why do some people tell you your writing is lacking and then can't even be bothered to spare a sentence or two as to why? It makes me feel like I am no longer an adequate enough writer for roleplay.",

            "selftext": "Okay, I've roughly had this partner for around 8 yrs on and off. This is a partner that has a recurring pattern of ghosting on and off. How I've managed to maintain this partnership despite the repeated ghosting? I don't know, it's a mystery to me. But this person has a history of ghosting me a lot. And I mean a LOT. \n\nWe would talk for about maybe a few months and they would start to kind of 'flicker'. At first, they wouldn't respond for a few days; which is fine with me. Then the time between responses would gradually increase to once a week. Then after about a month of 'flickering', they would end up disappearing for pretty much for the rest of the year, without a word. \n\nI mean the time sometimes varies, as sometimes they'll actually disappear for an entire year (after they talk with me for a while and start 'flickering'). It's quite frustrating beyond belief for me. Especially since I know why they ghost. It isn't due to the fact they're busy, but it's due to the fact they honestly have been too afraid to tell me they've lost interest in our rp \\[so they avoid me entirely\\]. How do I know this? They've told me when I asked them directly. I used to chase them down when they'd ghost me at first \\[after a couple of days to a week usually\\]; but I eventually just let them ghost me \\[unless if I was particularly interested in an rp, then I would chase them down after 4 days\\]. I just wished they would've been more upfront with me, but no, I've constantly had to chase them. It's annoying as hell and I know I actually feel pretty damn resentful over having to constantly chase them down to only be told \"I'm sorry I'm no longer interested\".\n\nI know it's no fun to be upfront and admit that you've lost interest but this partner has known me for 8 yrs-ish. They know I will not snap at them and go absolutely apeshit. But I would rather know they are not interested sooner than later \\[instead of either having to chase them down days later or literally never getting a response again on a particular rp\\]. \n\nWhile I can relate to having a hard time telling someone you're not interested in a rp anymore; I've definitely made way more of an effort to communicate than they have. I've usually had to be the one to ask them what's up and if they're still interested. \n\nI would think after knowing each other for 8 years, that they would have the decency to return the effort. I know it's not fun \\[as trying to tell people I'm no longer interested in an rp is like rubbing sandpaper on an open wound for me\\] but I still do it at least 70% of the time with my partners \\[despite not even knowing them for a quarter as long\\]. It just pisses me off as I've been the only one who's ever made more of an effort to communicate in comparison to them.\n\nI've only been tolerating this for a while due to the fact it's absolutely difficult to find someone nowadays. I've already cycled through 20+ people on reddit alone to try to find partners I clicked with. And when we have written together we do click pretty well, which is what keeps drawing me right back to them. After all, everyone likes having a partner they just click with when it comes to their writing styles.\n\nBut to be quite frank, the last time they left me \\[in what I assumed would be the actual FINAL time we'd communicate\\] it's definitely left a mark on me. It pretty much nearly killed all the love I had for all this hobby \\[to the point I was even considering dropping this hobby entirely\\]. It's taken me a grueling 7 months to get to the point where I'm actually starting to have fun again.\n\nThey've come back recently \\[after what I assumed would be the last time we ever rped or talked again\\] and it's left me feeling conflicted. They've said that they've gotten better at communicating \\[supposedly\\] but to be quite frank, I don't know if I want to entirely rp or even *talk* with them again. After all, I don't want to end up stressing out over the chance they'll basically ghost me once again. I even trust them less than I did before. I also feel VERY resentful of them due to the fact they've honestly sucked at communicating in the past \\[and that I'm the partner who's had to make the most effort out of them to communicate\\].\n\nBut I'm conflicted. We've talked plenty OOC \\[usually before they ghost\\]. I know they aren't entirely a bad person nor are they ghosting me out of malicious intent. They're like a lot of people in the rp community and don't like confrontation. And I tend to be quite pessimistic anyways, so I don't entirely trust myself. Maybe there is a possibility they've gotten better at communication and won't do that ghosting process I've mentioned. I just know I don't trust them either. I don't trust that they will communicate \\[as this is a pattern they have done over the years we've rped together\\].\n\nIt's just tough as we pretty much have absolutely nothing in common with me outside of rp. And considering they change their rp interests more than a person changes underwear, it's frustrating as hell for me. Especially since they tell me they like my writing a lot (and they've told me that in the past too). But their past actions tell me otherwise. When they're uninterested in an rp, they've consistently 'flickered' and ghosted in the past. It even happens when they suggest their own ideas.\n\nOof, it's just a rough situation overall as a part of me doesn't want to break off everything with them forever either. Except for the fact they've been a chronic ghoster in the past, they otherwise seem like a good person. Telling someone who seems like a good person for the most part that I never want to even rp with them again is tough when we've rped for almost 8 yrs on and off. Especially since we have nothing in common outside of rping, so we would more than likely never talk again. We've already stopped talking when we weren't rping together at all.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is really rant-worthy so much as irksome, but what's with the pre-emptive blocking? Case in point, someone reaches out to me via Discord, after seeing an old ad of mine somewhere, and wanted to see if I was still looking for partners. I'm not actively looking, but hey, if something promising drops into my lap, I'm not gonna say no, so we chat a bit, kinda gauging each other's compatibility. I ask for writing samples (mine were in my ad), they send over a couple, so far so good. Chat a bit more, they like to start off with a whole cast of characters, and I usually prefer to start small and build out from there, but it's not really a deal-breaker. I'm still feeling them out, ask another question about what sort of genre they're jonesing for, and then... nada. For about a week.\n\nBut, whatever, I'm not too troubled by ghosting. Figure they'll reach out again if they want to. \n\nAnd they do, finally, just to tell me they're not comfy with a partner who won't double and wish me luck in my search. Okay, again, no big deal. The silence pretty much told me that, but at least they gave me closure. So I try to respond with something similar: no worries, good luck in your search, yadda yadda... only to find that they've blocked me.\n\n*That's* the part that irks me. At no point in our interaction did I say or do anything to warrant a blocking. And I get the fear of offending someone by a rejection, so maybe that's why they blocked me, before I could say anything unpleasant. But still, isn't that what blocking's *for*? To mute someone who's being awful or harassing -- not just, okay, this brief conversation didn't work out, now I never want to see or hear from you again. It's like making a point in an argument and then walking out of the room (which my stepdad used to do so maybe I'm really reacting to *that*, but hey, know thyself).\n\nIf this were the first time it ever happened, I could chalk it up to just that one person being overzealous. But it's not -- I don't remember the exact circumstances before, but kinda similar scenarios. Chatting with potential partners, you're not quite vibing or the conversation dies out, then find out later after an attempted message that they've blocked you.\n\nMaybe blocking is way more prevalent than I ever realized. I almost *never* block anyone. To me, it seems like the sort of thing you do when someone's being awful and pestering and stalkery. And, thankfully, I guess I don't encounter too many of those. Maybe it's also my age demographic. I'm too old to get caught up in a bunch of pointless drama. I lurk more than I engage. I see no point in trying to win an internet argument. Who's got time for all that?\n\nBut I guess I'm not too old to make a post about a thing that irritated me! So there ya go.",

            "selftext": "**trigger warning for physical, emotional, sexual abuse**\n\nI'm not sure how I found this subreddit but I'm glad that I did. For years I've been struggling to try to unwind a \"friendship\" I had with a college friend. I'm also a bit scared to post this because I still deal with a lot of self blame but I'm hoping maybe by the end to get some advice on how to either prevent this or stand up for myself if this were to happen again. Also... I guess trying to see if anyone else's abuser used roleplay as part of their abuse?\n\nNot explicit detail of the previously mentioned triggers but please be mindful. This is also about 1x1 RP rather than on a forum, all took place over instant messaging. \n\n&gt;!Pretext before the roleplay aspect: \"Sarah\" (obviously not her real name) and I met in our first year of college, and started to hit off a friendship after she agreed to try to design a logo for the club I was in. in retrospect at the start, she was very pushy with making sure that I was online like... all the time. Aside from the roleplay aspect that I will get to soon, our \"friendship\" turned into one where I didn't really have any best friends anymore due to fallout from an extremely traumatic event for me in 2011. That's a relevant RP detail that will come up later! To be brief: she enjoyed humiliating me in front of our friends and the woman I had a crush on at the time, escalated it to one (1) instance of physical abuse, and also perpetuated three sexual assaults against me. This context is important because of the bad roleplay part.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!So... the RP. She had a novel she was working on about a troubled protagonist and I was working on a story with my own troubled protagonist, so why not start a 1 on 1 RP in an AU where they know each other? My own OC began to understand that her OC was in a toxic relationship, had some severe childhood trauma that he was not able to deal with, and then the perpetrators of his childhood trauma came back and kidnapped our characters. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Something she would write into our scenes sometimes would be things that were specific triggers of mine relating to my 2011 trauma (also, she got a kick out of startling me on purpose when my PTSD was at it's worst by exposing me to jumpscares, so  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  pretty sure this was not an accident). !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The plot, wherever it was going, and the things that happened to our characters were 100% within her control. I started to try to write ways for my own character to try to signal to other characters in the setting that something was wrong. I never knew what she was going to throw into the story next. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Now, I love angst. I love hurt/comfort. I love dark storylines, corrupted AUs, all of that. All of this was done though without any prior discussion at all of like... what our RP boundaries are. Years later with my (now) spouse we've done some dark RP where I knew my character(s) could get injured and we both have particular boundaries we could talk about. She already had a precedent for violating mine face to face with sexual assault and only saved face if someone actually called her out on her shit, but with just us, who did she have to answer to? The plot of the story was driven into the ground when her perp OCs succeeded in in a graphic, drawn out rape scene that also involved a separate side-character's murder. It was such a visceral stopping point that she even admitted \"Yeah I have no idea what to do with this now.\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I blame myself for not actually putting boundaries up, but I don't think I knew or would have known to ask to not put graphic rape and snuff into our roleplay, or to explain that writing my character overhearing the violence being committed on hers was really triggering. I blame myself constantly for not just like, logging off?? BUT recall earlier, how at the beginning of our friendship, she would constantly be messaging me to be online. Every day.  She set expectations for how often I should be online, kept me awake for hours after I had already said I wanted to go to bed with guilt tripping to keep writing--I would liveblog my reactions to the RP in real time without context to my followers and she loved it. I regret this now, so much. I want to mass delete it all but I feel like it's getting rid of \"evidence\". !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I no longer blame myself for the actual physical and sexual abuse thankfully. I've asked friends about the roleplay situation, if writing this sort of plot without any discussion or clear consent is an aspect of the sexual abuse she had already committed against me and I had answers of yes. I never just logged off or closed out the window or confronted her like \"HEY, PLEASE TONE IT DOWN\". I've had a goddamn therapist compare my friendship with Sarah to something akin to a domestic violence situation. !&lt;\n\nTo my knowledge I don't believe she's active in any forum RP or if she does any RP at all anymore. We still have some overlap, unfortunately, in some of our online circles and it has almost extended into our IRL circles but not yet. All of this was through 2010-2014 and it's taken me several years to fully process, especially since I *never* hear about like.... roleplay, collaborative storytelling, etc being used as a tool of abuse. I'm just left with guilt. I don't know where to *put* this or how to actually deal with it. Most of the time now when I RP with friends we don't do scenes this heavy or graphic so discussion of boundaries is like \"no domestic violence, no misgendering, etc\" and it's easy. Boom. Done. Can RP be used as an abuse tactic? Has anyone else felt guilted or obligated into continuing?",

I've been trying very hard to \"kill it with kindness\" but am starting to get pretty frustrated by the blatant mistreatment. \n\nSo it got me wondering, at what point do you guys cut the cord on a community where you love the members and your plots but are made to feel increasingly uncomfortable and unwelcome by the mod team?

Been in one thread for nearly a year now where me and my partner, someone I picked up on Reddit, have kept up on communication and both of us have been pretty good about sharing ideas and whatnot. It's based off a post apocalyptic style game that came out not too long ago. I've been okay with some deviation from the canon just for fun and to see where it goes. \n\nHowever, this last response one of their characters was able to chemically alter themselves and take on characteristics of the thread's enemies without becoming infected themselves because they're immune? \n\nIt's kinda throwing off my immersion and the rest of my characters are your regular, standard person. They don't have any special abilities apart from their survival skills and whatnot. We haven't discussed this part in the thread so it threw me for a loop. I just don't know how to respond as it's currently my turn. \n\nMy rp partner is very creative and I don't want to put them down at all but... I just don't know what exactly to do here. I don't want to stop the rp but I'm not sure how exactly to continue from here without addressing this. \n\nMy question here is this: how do I properly address their character somehow being able to alter themselves and take on superhuman traits in a game that doesn't, at least not that I've seen, allow for it? Again I'm down to slight deviations from the canon but, to me, this was a little... excessive? \n\nThey have come with some interesting ideas to our thread and I don't want them to lose that creative edge. \n\nThanks for reading!",
