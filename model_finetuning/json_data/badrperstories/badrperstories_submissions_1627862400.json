            "selftext": "Okay, so I am obsessed with Genshin Impact, the game, and its male characters. I was sooo excited that I finally found someone to roleplay it with that was into MxM, and shared all of the same preferences with me.\n\nI just wanna state that I would give my roleplay partner, especially one that I consider a friend too, all the time in the world to make a response for me in case their life either gets busy, or they lack inspiration.\n\nAnyways, let's move onto the story.\n\nIt began around six months ago; that is when I first started looking for people. This one person texted me that they would be interested, and I was with my head in clouds at that moment.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is them going offline mode instantly when I mentioned that I get anxious when somebody ghosts me without telling me the reason why. I paid no mind to that, as I thought that if they are truly busy, they may go online only for a second and not even have the time to respond then that they were just nice and didn't want to make me anxious with that too.\n\nWe roleplayed, for around two months, the same plot. The responses were very slow, considering they were truly busy, but I did not mind.\n\nWe had a discord server only with the two of us, so seeing them online on it was possible even though they were on invisible. Yet, I paid no mind to that once again. They were responding from time to time, and everything seemed to be going great; I appreciated it.\n\nWe came to become more than just roleplay partners, we befriended one another, shared cute fanarts together, and even voice called a few times.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, they ghosted me straight 2 weeks. I assumed they were busy, so I didn't say anything. I had them on steam, so seeing them play games 24/7 was definitely not... that at all. Then after the 2 weeks passed, they texted me with a message that they were busy at work. I knew who they were working as, since they told me, and gaming wasn't a part of their job at all. I just wished them good luck with their job, and said that I hope everything is going well for them over there.\n\nDays by days gone, I kept thinking about it as I truly can get attached to people. My boyfriend saw how low I was about this, so he texted them and asked what's up without my knowledge. They happily responded that they are going to check on me. Yet, they still ghosted my message for a few days. He told me that after it was said and done, that's when I realized.\n\nI decided to end this by writing a veeery long goodbye message to them, removing them as a friend and also leaving the server. I was sad that I had to leave; so many nice memories were created there, but they owned the server, so they'd probably end up removing it either way. The only thing I forgot about was to remove them from Steam; for a few days, they remained on my friend list. Yet, I got no message from them until I remembered and removed them myself (yes, they were online too during those days.)\n\nI know some of you may take it as cringe to get attached to someone so easily. But as we called one another friends, that it was online did not matter at all. I value other's feel the same, whether it's in real life or online.",

            "selftext": "Recently I put out some rp ads. \n\nA requirement was for the character to be poc.\n\nFirst I was told no one would want to roleplay with me because I only wanted black characters. Not true. Poc \u2260 Black. \n\nSecond I said in the post that I was tired of vanilla swirl mixed race black/white, white passing couple. \n\nI start a roleplay with someone, imagining their character as Mexican and then they describe their character with porcelain skin. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong. Mexican people are poc in their own right. Problem is : If this man has porcelain skin........ Do I have to explain? \n\nAnd if someone comes to me one more time describing their character as tan and dark tan... \n\nTan \u2260 POC. Just because your character is \"tan\" does not mean they are poc. \n\nI understand a lot of non poc people don't feel comfortable playing poc people. But the people that are coming to me just describing their character as tan w/ no race/ethnicity/ or region or anything behind it just???????? Yk? Like... Tan... Dark tan... Light tan...? Are they South east Asian? Are they Afro Latino? Are they Polynesian? Serbian???? I don't know! They are just dark tan or light tan! Or tan! ! For all I know your character is just a white dude who put on sun tan lotion and chilled in the sun!! \n\nIt's just funny that even when I find someone who IS poc they opt to RP a white/white passing character. Your character is your character that's fine, but the sea of RP is HEAVILY saturated with white/white passing characters. (And after that is east asians also typically described having pale white skin). \n\nI just want to roleplay a mixed / POC couple and they're both brown or black or asian (which I actually do have the Asian one going LOL).  Just you don't see that on TV or in most visual media. It's usually black/white if it's on TV. I read a book and it was a Persian brown kid and a Mexican brown girl and I just was like yeah, I want that. That's the mixed race poc couple I want!! I been wanting that but I can't find it! \n\nI hope that some of the rps I picked up with these \" tan \" characters end up going well at least. I try not to be extremely picky. This has just been bugging me. All of my characters are black / mixed black (AA, Caribbean, English etc) and I swear I never once had a RP that starred two black characters that were main and I wish!!! I could!!!!!!! That's all i want. \n\nPOC as main role.\nAnyway! Sorry for the vent :') Hopefully it didn't come off wrong I am tired :')",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m back roleplaying after a very long hiatus but there are some things I\u2019ve been noticing from one of the players in this group rp my friend invited me to join. It\u2019s only one person so far as everyone else seems cool.\n\nNow for context my character has been getting a lot of attention from another player I will call Peach. After playing one scene with Peach, we pretty much have enjoyed the surprising dynamic our two characters have and lately their interactions have started to become flirtatious from time to time whenever we have a scene together. But here\u2019s the thing: there\u2019s this other player I will call Apple who is Peach\u2019s friend and also has a storyline with Peach\u2019s character that involves them being in love but not having confessed their true feelings to each other yet. Apple doesn\u2019t seem to care much for me and my character as they barely talk to me in the server chat and they usually have something passive aggressive to say when someone makes a comment about my character so I suspect it\u2019s because of my scenes with Peach.\n\nSometime later, Apple has decided to bring in a new character and asked me if I was interested in shipping my character with theirs. I politely declined letting them know I don\u2019t do preplanned romance plots as most of my  plots are about what\u2019s going on in the current story events that are not romance-centric (if the romance occurred naturally Im not against it). I did tell them I was open to them being friends because I\u2019m thinking to myself  maybe Apple is trying to make an effort with me. I come up with a scene just for our characters to do something together and before they could even get a chance to go on their trip, Apple\u2019s new character springs up how \u201cBob (Apple\u2019s other character) and Mary (Peach\u2019s character)are so head over heels for each other, I just need to help them realize it\u201d. My character has not prompted them to make this kind of comment plus they hate \u201cMary\u201d so I was confused as to why Apple thought they would care but I rolled with it, having them to give their friend advice on how to play matchmaker. They then still keep bringing \u201cBob\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d up in most of their scenes together. I also noticed now Apple has to have this new character mention something about \u201cBob\u201d a few times whenever Peach\u2019s \u201cMary\u201d is in a scene with us or always want to have their character or \u201cBob\u201d pop up in my and Peach\u2019s scenes.\n\nPeach has not changed the way \u201dMary\u201d interacts with my character so their dynamic is still the same. Apple\u2019s general attitude towards me and my character hasn\u2019t changed either as they mostly ignore discussions or make a passive aggressive comments when they are brought up in chat plus I\u2019m the only one who brings up scenes for them to do. I\u2019m questioning Apple\u2019s intentions for wanting to have their new character to be involved with plots with mine and if I should continue them being friends. Does Apple have underhanded intentions or am  I reading too much into this? Has something like this happen to any of you?",

I live for the most bare minimum intermediate rp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe requirement for this rp is i write 3 paragraphs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo he wanted me to play the Pantheress on the show and i am ok with that.   Now he wanted me to have sex. So i did and I did it the best i could. The best someone was castrated could.  He even wanted an rp where he wears a condom and wants me to speak hindi. I go to google translate and do this and he is shocked by what I can say thinking I'm a polyglot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I was not into it. I would spend days,  months, even weeks trying to get back to his replies all because i was trying to be nice. In this time I was wanting to get to more fun simpler roleplays but not even that. I wanted to get back to drawing because I am on a fucking art website with adoring fans who know my talent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said \"Can we stop this role play after this?\" He said \"Yes, and then we do another.\"  Ok this guy seriously cannot take a fucking hint. What I meant to say is \"I don't ever want to rp with you again! Or rp at all.\" His rps are so boring, uninteresting and drawn out.  I don't do sex. Not that kinda sex even. I never had sex! I HATE THIS!! But I bottled all that up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one night my mom came over to my new apt. I was sad.  I told her a guy wont stop texting me. So long story short. I messaged him and blocked him. I was so happy after this. I hope he is dazed and confused why i blocked him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so stupid.",

            "selftext": "So recently, I found myself a new rp partner and they're honestly amazing. They have interesting characters, are a good writer, and are friendly in OCC. There's just one problem: They spend more time in OCC chat talking to me than they do actually roleplaying with me. For context, they do this thing where they tell me they're going to write a reply, and then end up just talking to me for hours instead of actually writing it.  \n\n\nI don't mind talking to them, I actually enjoy it as we seem to have lot in common, but they leave the rp on the back-burner just to talk to me, and I don't want to be rude so I talk to them. I'm not sure if I'm just ungrateful or impatient, but it's frustrating to be told I'm getting a reply and then it not actually be there. I understand life happens, but if you can talk to me, you can write a reply. Am I just being impatient? Should I talk to them about it? What do you guys think?",

            "selftext": "Hi there! First time poster but I've been lurking forever and thought of my own story to share and made a new reddit just to tell it :3\n\nThis was many years ago, on a long-since-defunct forum that people often used to find 1x1 RPs which at the time were usually just called 'solo' RPing. The community had an adult lean, and I generally had a pretty good time there as a late teen/early 20something, though I was only there for a few months. I mostly kept to myself, had a few good people I RPed with, and otherwise stayed off the boards.\n\nThat was until we meet Joanne. Joanne was pretty well known on the forums, and at one point we had a similar taste in a certain fandom RP and so I started an RP in the PM system with her.\n\nJoanne seemed pretty neat. We had a lot of stuff in common, were doing similar coursework at the time, and was just all around great to talk to. Our characters got along fabulously, we had a really deep involved plotline that I was having a lot of fun with.\n\nThat was until the day that we were writing some fairly NSFW content and Joanne decided to suggest her character have uh...relations...with a dog.\n\nThis caught me off guard. Of course it caught me off guard. Obviously she meant a furry anthro, right? so I asked her. No she meant a legit honest-to-goodness laborador retriever.\n\nOf course I thought this was disgusting so I told her so and ended the RP with her immediately, which obviously made her very angry. I also reported it to the moderators. \n\nThe next thing I know I'm banned from the forums. The reason given in the ban? 'We don't kinkshame here'.\n\nSo yeah that's the story of how I got banned from a now no-longer-existent RP forum for shaming someone's bestiality kink.",

She was planning a Secret admin {which one of the old admins was removed in the past for doing the very same} She also knew people were \"spying\" on her and was trying to use this \"nice cop\" account to weed us out. Technicly worked lol. Given we are all banned BUT.  \nThere are always those who will dislike her {includeing other admins} to get the dirt on her...Like the fact she made a discord for all the admins{but not the owner of the site.} So she could talk shit about other members and the owner himself.   \nClassy  \nBut yeah thats my update",

            "selftext": "So I made some posts on a few different subreddits, looking for a Law &amp; Order: SVU roleplay as it's one of my favorite shows and I'm very interested in giving it a shot! I wasn't expecting too many messages for it, so I was very excited when I got a message inquiring about it this morning!  \n\n\nSo this person started out with a greeting and said they're interested in roleplaying with me.  They didn't give detail, didn't give their age or pronouns, didn't say if they like canon x canon or oc x canon, but whatever. I didn't ask anyone to tell me that right off the bat in my post, so whatever. I can easily move past that. So I say hello and ask if they prefer canon x canon or if they have an OC! They respond by asking if I'd be open to another universe that isn't the SVU setting as they aren't interested in that for RP. Well, I assumed they meant an AU! I'd mentioned that I was cool to do AU's in my post, so I just asked to confirm that they meant an AU with the same characters.   \n\n\nThey said no. They wanted to do an X-men roleplay. I said no and expressed my confusion in why they were asking me for this rp. I've never expressed an interest for X-men on my account, nor did my post mention that I'd be open to other fandoms. They responded with (and I quote), \"Because I was hoping you'd be open to it, but apparently you're so laser focused on getting what you want you're not even open to entertaining the idea of maybe catering to others once in a while.\"  \n\n\nWTF??? This person who has never ever talked to me before, randomly asks me to do an RP for a fandom that I've never expressed an interest in, then gets mad when I won't. Also, the assumption that I've never catered to anyone else ever....Pretty bold assumption to make when this person and I have never talked before. Also, they're getting mad at me for not catering to them when they're the one that reached out to ME about a specific fandom post, then asked for something completely different. At this point I think I'm done looking for RP on reddit. It's impossible these days.",

            "selftext": "You ever hate it when an rp you liked or invested in gets deleted or replaced with another thread? especially if it was still on the \"first chapter\" of sorts?   \n\n\nWell that was how I felt a few years back, an online friend of mine (will call him wheat) who had been rping with me and a few others had started to create a persona 5 rp ( during its hayday) which took place after the original story. We were interested and decided to join.  \n\n\nWhile my time with him is a bit fuzzy since I dont rp with him anymore, heres somethings to know. Wheat lived in the Philippines while I lived in Pennsylvania, making rping with him a bit difficult since its usually in the night time....like 11:00 pm/12:00 am night time. He also ran a few other rps and participated in some. Hes also somewhat of a good host/story writers for the rps I was in with him (which was why I stuck with him for so long...like 3 or 4 years), though sometimes he was real slow with responses. Sometimes its like 5 to 9 posts a day, others its like 2 to 4, really slow.   \n\n\nAnd the last thing I remember the the most important thing, he had a bad habit of ghosting rps or side rps when it gets slow or worst case, lost interest. Which I feel like is what happened, which really pissed me off to the point where I didnt want him as the host ever again since I was REALLY invested in the rp and its concept. What was even worst was the rp was IN ITS FIRST CHAPTER, and we had 2 new rpers who barely got to rp, and one of them was a friend who was interest too. Whats worst was he erased all the threads in the discord and replaced it with new franchise he wasnt even that invested in originally. At that point I was just done with him as a host and left the server, I also felt like this rp wouldn't last long either.",

            "selftext": "I love canon x oc. I don't do it nearly as much as I used to as I am not always up with current trends and my list has become far smaller over the years.\n\nBut there is something that always annoys the piss out of me anytime I write canon x oc.\n\nPeople who want the canon character to be absolutely how they envision them with no work around.\n\nI get it. You want to play the character as close to how they are, you want to do them justice and that is completely fine. There are two things that become an issue with this though. They don't understand the character as they don't fully know them. I run into this with video game fandoms often, they run into the canon, mostly ignore them or don't interact more than a passing speech and continue on.\n\nThis could be easily solved if these people ever wanted to discuss the character or even do a quick read up of them. Though, I suspect really they're excited someone is going to play their favorite canon for their OC and don't want to risk me dropping the role play but don't want to put the work in to give me what I give them.\n\nThe second one is when people want to stick as close the canon characters as possible (which can honestly be hard as we are injecting OCs into the mix and things have to be changed around to some degree for that) but only for the canon they are playing. This one gets me the most. I'm used to the first issue to the point of shrugging it off.\n\nWhy tell me you want an acurate portrayal of the canon character you asked for but then want a slew of changes to them?\n\nI have an example story of this:\n\nSomeone messages me for a story set in a game we both enjoy. They want me to play one of the villain characters for them in exchange for playing one of the villain characters for me.\n\nI am down, because I honestly have such a hard time finding people for this certain character and I love playing villains as much as I love having villains played for me. We move from the site that contained the search to discord and begin plotting. Things are going well, we decide to stick to what is said will happen should our characters group be taken over by the villains.\n\nHere is where it becomes annoying. We began to talk about interactions, how our characters will react to one another and it's pretty standard for the group. They are a not-very-dope-group for women. Women have set roles in the villain group, despite having very strong roles in their own group. Misogyny is a legitimate problem that our characters would have to face and will need to learn to thrive in their upcoming positions without overstepping bounds set forth.\n\nThe character she asks played for her? The leader of the group. The one who created the laws that say women are only meant to be slaves or wives.\n\nDope, should be easy enough to play that.\n\nI ask for a lower officer in the group.\n\nShould be super easy to play that.\n\nShe tells me how this character will never feel anything for my character, be annoyed with them, etc. etc. because the group hates women after all. The issue with this is that it's his wife. And these men aren't known for being awful to their wives, just to women who are slaves or have no connection to them.\n\nAlso this character doesn't really have much to say on women at all. He is one of the few who, if you are playing a female character in the game, doesn't have a slew of special dialogue about how you're a woman and can't do this or that. He seems to respect your character for their ability to wipe out an entire camp and rewards you for it. Unlike a lot of the characters who will straight up have issue with a female character in game.\n\nThe leader I was playing however? I was meant to play him as somehow respecting her character. He finds her smart and charming and they grow a good back and forth. He is fond of her and allows her things he doesn't even allow his male soldiers.\n\nI was legitimately confused. She wanted me to play the characters true to canon, but wants the man who passed these laws to somehow respect a woman he literally considers a savage?\n\nI had to nope out of there after a few posts because I couldn't get over how hellbent she was on this perfect depiction of how these characters should be played but not for the canon she wanted. Add on the fact that she was true to her word and my OC and the canon had no ground to stand on and was fizzling out on things to post almost immediately.\n\nI run into this once in a blue moon, but it is still something that absolutely annoys me to no end every time. I hate a \"rules for thee but not for me\" writer.",

I probably should have told them I wasn't looking anymore but I'm too curious for my own good. I ask them a few questions and then we move over to discord where I ask more questions. Short story shorter (we didn't make it long), they accuse me of being rude and ignoring their questions for my own. They later tried to post a comment that I grill people to hard.\n\nComing from a D&amp;D perspective I'm used to having to give interviews to check if people will be a good fit for a campaign I'm running. Is it possible my interview skills are too rough? Any advice on how to sound polite when asking questions through text? Should I opt to do vc interviews instead of text to try to better show my intentions?\n\nSince I don't want to share more than I have to, for context of what my questions were like I only asked them one question at a time and waited for an answer before asking another.

As others of my kind might have experienced, that means no one is ever interested when I want to do anything else.  The only way I'm the F is when it's an FXF story which is a rare treat that never last long before they ask me to play M instead.  I don't even need to ship.  Just let me be your bff or something, geeze.  I still enjoy writing with them, but after a few years of this, it's obviously time to get some new friends.  I'm working on it.\n\nI put out some ads in various places looking for a FxM pairing for some sort of medieval dark fantasy.  None of these were posted in any sort of dedicated NSFW space.  Why do so many people see the words 'dark fantasy' and immediately jump to sexual assault and/or corrosion?  And when you say you're not interested, they try to convince you that you should and not doing so means you're an inferior rper.  And, whenever I found someone who didn't immediately jump to rape, they'd ask for stories centered around bdsm themes.  Not bad within itself, but it's not what I'm looking for and it said so in my ad.\n\nSo I changed up my ad and posted it AxA hoping to have better luck.  I don't need to play FxM if it means dealing with that mess.  But now instead of people wanting to assault  my characters, I also now got people wanting my characters to assault theirs.  Again, these aren't even nsfw spaces let alone ones that cater to... that.\n\nAll I wanted was a story with dark magic, creepy ambiance, and existential horror. Why do people have to make it weird?  :(",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, just a bit of a rant here!\n\nI met a nice partner about two months ago. In their post they requested for their new partner not to ghost, due to them having past experiences and trauma from being ghosted. Which is very understandable, being ghosted can be painful and leave you hurt.\n\nWhen we got to writing my partner would get impatient or ask for opnions on their post if I didn't reply back right away or if I wrote a reply to another person before getting to our RP. A bit of a red flag, but we talked about it, I reasurred them that I wouldn't ghost and things were good again. They were a kind person and once they were past those insecurities, things went great, both in the story and in OOC as we chatted and wrote daily!\n\nAnd then... Nothing. Several days of nothing, no warning at all, no response to messages. When they got back to me I was glad and they told me they'd gotten busy with life. Which happens, life over rp always, this is a hobby and life is more important.\n\nBut on the other end it stung a bit. I spend my time to have them feel safe and be able to trust me about the whole not getting ghosted thing, only to then get ghosted myself. I confronted them about that, there was a small argument, they admitted it wasn't that nice of them, all was good again and we went back to writing and chatting for several days.\n\nAnd then... They ghosted again. I very much hope they are okay and hope to talk to them again, though I'm a bit wary now in case they are to come back. It's a really conflicting feeling.\n\nTo whoever took their time to read this, thanks so much for reading!",

            "selftext": "So, let me start by saying I try to be as nice as possible. I'm a rather gentle person and tend to be a non-confrontational soul. It's proven to be a problem for me over and over again. I'm not proud of it, but I've ended up ghosting a few people just because I wasn't able to confront them about something I found uncomfortable! Either way, this is a little tell-tale about one of my recent roleplay partners. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had a knack for SoL and Fantasy stuff recently. Luckily, I found a partner that was willing to do both! We had this great story and world that we worked on together for months. It was very similar to those Isekai animes. Dungeons, levels, all of that. I enjoyed myself. For a while, it seemed like they did too. Not once did their response quality drop! If I did something they didn't like or weren't comfortable with, they'd tell me right away. Even I got comfortable enough with them that I got to call them out on things I didn't like, and all went smooth. This all started about 4 months ago? And it ended just today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up, messaging them to ask them how their day was. We were pretty friendly with each other OOC, so this was pretty much routine. Though my response was pretty harsh, and I've been somewhat hurt by it. I keep overthinking whether others have an issue with it too. I've genuinely never felt so saddened by someone online. I'd appreciate some feedback from readers, too. I wouldn't say I'm excessively positive, though I do have moments where I'm over-apologetic and that type of stuff. It's hard to explain since I don't know how others perceive it! I have no idea what happened to them, and I hope they're doing fine, though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm asking is: Is a happy-go-lucky personality a red flag or annoying when it comes to roleplay? I've never experienced this, and I've had many long-term partners.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2zh17gnve71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d225eed902409296ae38ad91fdabded8213528f6",

They will make one with blue hair and gold high lights. If my character has a giant wolf guardian. They will design one with a giant cat guardian. I have started to find it a bit awkward but I don\u2019t know if it is actually concerning but it does bother me roleplay wise.

            "selftext": "[Previous Post I'm referring to](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/orxb7o/partner_whos_repeatedly_ghosted_in_the_past_came/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I've had a chance to confront the serial ghoster I referred to in my previous post. Surprisingly, they didn't try to wriggle out of it too much; they just basically mentioned they were having a rough time throughout the years we've chatted on and off. Which okay, was pretty obvious to me \\[I mean I didn't know exactly what, but I could tell they had some mental health problems of their own; as some of their other OOC behavior sent up some red flags for me besides the chronic ghosting\\] so I mean I wasn't going to shit on them for that. Especially when they said they knew they were being an asshole looking back now \\[when they apparently didn't realize they were being an asshole due to apparently having ASD + some other kind of problem (idk what, all I know is apparently they were abnormally aggressive and had a victim complex according to them)\\] and apologized for ghosting me repeatedly like that over the years. Hell, they were even supportive of me deciding to not talk to them again if I didn't want to.\n\nOof the kind and supportive behavior already makes me feel like a gigantic dick, as I'm ngl; I've already been considering dumping them. \n\nAnd here's the rub for me, they also mentioned that this time they decided to ghost me due to the fact I'm a private person. Which is very true and fair, I am a private person. Outside of mentioning superficial things like fave hobbies, pets, rp stuff and etc; I rarely talk about anything serious. In fact, in the 8ish years I've known them, I think me bringing up the fact that I had a terminally ill family member who was in the midst of dying was the only time I truly brought up anything serious with them. \n\nI've never really talked about my mental health issues with them in depth; due to the fact the last time I did it with my previous rp partner before them \\[who I got very close with\\] and I ended up in a very violent sort of relationship. We knew too much about each other and became way too dependent upon each other. Due to that previous experience, I figured I'd keep my mental health issues to myself mostly, unless if they were extreme \\[like the fact a loved family member was terminally ill\\]. I also figured I'd let them approach me if they wanted to about their mental heath, but I wouldn't purposely seek out information. I don't know if my choice to do that was a good idea or not; as it apparently saved me the trouble of having a lot of pointless fights with them but then they didn't know that ghosting to give me space was a bad idea either. \n\nSo I mean I feel a lot of fault for not maybe opening up more; maybe they would've gotten a clue about the fact I would've preferred at least an 'I'm sorry you're going through this wow holy shit that sucks' from them and for them to be around vs ghosting me/giving me space. I didn't need anything fancy and I didn't expect anything beyond us just casually shooting the shit again about our characters or something like that \\[as I would've *killed* for company where I could get a smile over our characters doing cute or stupid shit; I didn't need to talk about the IRL problems from the event too much as I already have a therapist for that\\].\n\nOof so I feel like an massive dick for that part too, as maybe I should've taken a different approach \\[versus instituting what may not be great boundaries of my own\\]. \n\nBut I'm still going to dump them as I've pretty much decided can't trust them anymore after I've given them multiple chances over the years. I just can't decide if I want to go with my immediate kneejerk asshole reaction of just ghosting them as it'd be *soooo* much easier than composing a sort of 'breakup letter' for them. But we've known each other for around 8ish yrs so I do feel like I owe them that letter. But I'm still going to feel like a massive asshole for dumping someone who seems to have genuinely changed for the better no matter what I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, that's the end of my pity party, if you made it this far have a cookie. \ud83c\udf6a",

A browser vampire game I used to play a while back had 2 RP chat rooms and i mainly spent time there than playing the actual browser-based game. But my character ran into two sisters {who in hindsight may? have been the same person?} Anyways. We all Rped for a month or two and in spite the fact they were both humans {with the ability to become practically any mythological creature via some magic beads of some sort} we got along.  \n\n\nFew months later an RP romance happens and well thats when things went a lil nuts. They BOTH started to flirt with me outside of the RP and would get mad at each other that I would not pick between the two of them. Sometimes one would threatan to kill themselves. Sure enough I NOPED the hell out of there.",

            "selftext": "So it's not often I get annoyed enough by roleplayers to actually be motivated to go onto reddit and start writing about it, but god this week has been worse than others! \n\n***TL:DR at the bottom of post.***\n\nJust a full disclosure, this is more a bit of ranting, so if my language paints a slightly exaggerated picture of what I'm talking about, my apologies. It will also explore an NSFW theme so I will mark that way just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it's not been a secret this week, I've been looking for a new long term roleplay partner. My two I usually play with have gone to university and has less time to write, and one has gotten a real life partner and understandably does not wish to write in the nature that we do. Not my biggest ask, even if I am a tad on the very detailed side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I hit a forum (not reddit) to try and find a new one.\n\nI create a brand new post, and list that I am looking exclusively for a female partner. I ask that that partner be bisexual, or at least comfortably play a bisexual character, due to the nature of my roles. It's listed in a sub category called \"sexual roleplaying\" - and it makes no secret that it's mostly one shots and very much sexual themed, so my partner knows what I'm looking for before they even respond.\n\n***Queue on my FIRST irritation from Partner 1:***\n\nHer: \"hi.\"  \nMe: \"Hello there! Thanks for reaching out :)\"  \nHer: \"roles\"  \nMe: \"I'll just get the list for you. Are you okay with these being sexual themed? I know it's silly but thought I'll make sure.\"  \nHer: \"yeah\"  \nMe: \\*Sends list\\*  \nHer: \"1\"  \nMe: Okay, sure.  \nHer: \"u start\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cant begin to describe usually how infuriating I find this, particularly this week. Like the post has made no secret that I'm looking for a well written partner. (that's always made clear).\n\nI might be in a minority here, but generally, if she cannot even put enough care or attention to use capital letters, a question mark, or write more than three words per line, or show even a basic conversational level, I generally lose all hope that this particular partner will be able to hold a competent level in a roleplay.\n\nWhat also adds to this for me, is that she has offered absolutely no creative input whatsoever, or asked any questions. Granted you might be clear on it anyway, but to ask nothing, not even suggest your own little quirks, mention any element of your own or express how you feel, just feels exceptionally lazy! When I quietly mentioned, hey, sorry to sound like the pedantic devils advocate, but am I going to get more than two words out of you at a time when I start? Do you have a character description?\n\nInsta-ghosted. Probably the biggest waste of both our time at that stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Queue on my FIRST irritation from Partner 2:***\n\nSo after shaking my head over the first one, I get the second type of roleplayer I normally run across. In she comes, talking pretty well.\n\nShe's a good conversationist, asks how my day is, whether I found a good partner, if I'm still looking, expressed a bit of dissatisfaction in a previous partner; all pretty simple things I'd expect from someone roleplaying to enjoy themselves, and not because they're purely bored.\n\nShe then asks for my list of roles. I send them across to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"These are all so sexual lol\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErm... Yes, because they're posted in a group called \"sexual roleplaying\", they prewarn you they're smut and based on that, and have a line about sexuality, all of which should really allude to them theme pretty easily.\n\nSo when I point this out to her, and ask what exactly she was expecting when replying to a post with the above three, she responds:\n\nHer: \"These are all so sexual lol\"  \nMe: \"Yes... They were posted in a sexual themed rp forum and do give warning, I'm genuinely curious what exactly you were looking for or expecting.\"  \nHer: \"Well I was hoping they'd be longer term and be romantic.\"  \nMe: \"My post literally says they're one shot smut roleplays.\"  \nHer: \"Yeah but they should still be romantic, why would you only play something physical like that?\"  \nMe: \"Because I'm literally posting in the forum specifically for that purpose?\"  \n\\*blocked by her\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink it goes without saying, the biggest irritation is that she's literally just not bothered to read where it was posted, and then acts like I'm supposed to change what I've suggested for her. Like walking into a family law firm, and asking them to handle a property sale, and then telling them why they'd only represent in family matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk, I'll leave the jury out on that with you guys and girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Queue on my FIRST irritation from Partner 3:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo once I'd gotten over that one, I get a third person! Wow, I'm really getting some messages here!\n\nSo far so good, a decent build up above. I sent across my roles, and this ensues:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: \"Perfect! Hit me with your list and let's see what we can do!\"  \nMe: \\*Sends over my list of roles\\*  \nHer: I don't want to be rude but I really don't like any of those.  \nMe: Well they're not for everyone. What sort of roles do you enjoy?  \nHer: I don't know  \nMe: ... Like give me an example of one you've done before you liked.  \nHer: Well I don't know really, I've done a lot  \nMe: Maybe give me a theme or element you like!  \nHer: I don't know, I'm sorry.  \nMe: So, you want me to suggest a role, but you don't know what you want, what you like, or even what sort of setting you want.  \nHer: I know im useless, sorry, but you can suggest something else :)  \n\n\nAs you can guess, there aren't many conversations I'll straight up ghost, but this was one. That's like walking into a shop to buy... idk, some garden furniture, and then just saying no to everything because you don't know what you need for your garden. At least give me SOME idea of what you want. I'm not a mind reader, I can't suggest anything without a starting point!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Queue on my FIRST irritation from Partner 4:***\n\nAnd yes, I can't believe it either, I got a fourth prospective partner!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame spiel as above, pretty good conversationist. I send over my list of roles, they've aware of what I'm expecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: I don't really like any of those...  \nMe: Oh okay! Well do you have any ideas for something else?  \nHer: Would you be okay with the roles being just your character and mine?  \n(Kinda defeats the idea of having a bisexual partner, as the roles I had themed needed this)  \nMe: Well, I suppose, depends what you're into. Hit me :)  \nHer: I'd like something more taboo  \nMe: Taboo how?  \nHer: Like teacher/student or CEO/secretary.\n\n**I already kinda knew where this one was going.**\n\nMe: Let me guess, you'd want to be the student or secretary and I have to have the power positions.  \nHer: Is that bad?  \nMe: Not by itself. Depends what you'd do when it came to the physical aspects and such.  \nHer: Well I'm very submissive.  \nMe: So what you'd need me to do is to come up with the roleplay, play a super powerful character, lead the story, and advance it, you'd need me to initiate all the physical encounters, bring in the romance and treat your character like a queen, and you would take the super stereotypically weak character, who's in for the ride, and just wants to hold the pillow and enjoy everything.  \nHer: Well when you put it that way it doesn't sound so great but yeah.  \nMe: Perfect, so you basically want an erotica story written for you - if you google \\[redacted website\\] that'll fit your needs much better than roleplay will.  \nHer: A\\*\\*\\*\\*le.  \nAnd then I got blocked.  \n\n\nSorry but that also rubs me the other way. At that point, you're not \"submissive\" - you're just \"lazy\". You literally want someone to write a customised version of 50 shades or something, while you get a nice A, B, C style interactive play. And that's not even setting aside that I made it clear I wanted a one shot, smut role play, with my own themes in there, and you've basically tried to bend it into a long term, romantic, taboo roleplay just makes absolutely no sense. Don't try and squeeze a round peg into a triangular hole. There is literally an entire other section of the forum for that theme of play!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty open and honest and nice to people when it comes to finding a new partner, but when you start doing these when you literally knew what you were getting into in the first place, you're going to rub me the wrong way, and you're going to do it in a hurry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Coming into a detailed roleplayer's thread, replying in messages less than three words long, with not even the care to add grammar, or even spell \"you\" instead of \"u\" - add no creativity or suggestions, and then just expect someone to start paints a terrible picture of my partner. Can't hold a basic conversation, probably can't hold a roleplay.\n2. Responding to a post in the **\"sexual roleplay\"** forum and literally complaining that the roles are **sexual,** and wondering why I don't have any romantic roles for them...\n3. Coming to my post, asking for my role ideas, politely declining all of them, and then proceed to give me **absolutely no clue** whatsoever as to what you like, what you enjoy, and claiming you don't know anything about what you want to play, and **expecting me to suggest something else.**\n4. Approaching my very clearly marked sexual roleplay post, declining all my roles, then suggesting a plot **completely different** in every way to what I've asked, then demand I take on a super powerful role, *lead the entire story, initiate romance, initiate all physical interactions, advance the play and treat her like a queen while she enjoys the ride.* I'm not writing you an erotica, I'm looking for someone to roleplay with. I'm also not looking to simulate your perfect boyfriend by text. Don't use **\"being submissive\"** as **\"being lazy\".**\n\n**What are you guy's thoughts?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can breathe now!!!",

            "selftext": "I want to start by saying, ghosting sucks, especially if you\u2019ve been well invested in a plot. Not denying that it or excusing the behavior. But I think it\u2019s also important to point out the inverse- impatience. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had people GO OFF because I hadn\u2019t responded in two days, then proceed to call me a \u201cghoster\u201d, delete our server and block me. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re extremely forgetful. If I don\u2019t get an occasional nudge, I WILL forget to reply. Furthermore\u2026 we have lives? Roleplay is a hobby, not a top priority. It\u2019s meant to be an enjoyable pastime, not a homework assignment. \n\nAgain, this does NOT apply to those who send check ins and get nothing back. All I\u2019m saying is before branding someone with the scarlet G, take a step back and realize that they may have forgotten or had extreme extenuating circumstances (death in a family, emergency etc) that takes major priority over a story. Also, even IF someone ghosts\u2026 why take energy out of your day to go on a blast mission? Why not take that negative energy and put it towards something productive? I just see so much drama over this one did this and that and it\u2019s like\u2026 Aren\u2019t we supposed to be adults? \n\nI guess to finish this rant, you don\u2019t have all of the pieces. Try to be empathetic. It\u2019s okay to be frustrated and hurt! Rant, vent be pissed! It isn\u2019t okay to assume and go after people.",

            "selftext": "Why does this seem to be an issue? A starter/plot idea tends to be very clear on the setting, or the setting is discussed by both parties before the roleplay. For a lot of the premade characters I have, I either write plots based around them and allow people to make or insert their own characters into the plot, or I find a partner and we discuss a setting based around both our characters. For example, I might write an action plot where our characters don't get along, and someone will ask to roleplay with this plot. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, maybe our characters looked at each other funny, hell, either of us might even just want to play an antagonist. In this case, we get going with the specific plot idea, then we take the story wherever it goes. \n\nA lot of the time, I will find people who are a lot of fun to roleplay with, and the roleplay is super engaging. However, there have been a few times when my partner uses a character for the plot I've written and discussed basic guidelines for (ex: \"this is not slice of life,\" \"this is not a romance roleplay,\" \"your character can have any abilities as long as they aren't god-like and unfair or literally unable to fight,\"), except said character has nothing to do with the plot. In the past, I've gotten: \n\n-A character with their face in their phone in a medieval kingdom \n\n-A magical warzone plot, but their character was on a completely different world and was in the middle of class in highschool (when confronted, my partner basically said \"well we can do an isekai and my character falls into the war,\" couldn't nope out of that one any quicker) \n\n-An fantasy action/fighting plot where my demon character is sent to recruit their character for their skills, knowledge, or strength (depending on what my partner's character specialized in), but their character was a completely normal person living their every day life. In-character, my demon guy tried to see if this person had some entity they were tied to, or maybe they had some power they didn't know they had. Nope, the guy they were sent to collect was a completely normal dude. I even asked out of character and my partner deadass said \"well they can sacrifice him or do a ritual to give him power.\" \n\n-A \"your character did a bad thing but they can redeem themselves\" plot where again, my partner's character is a completely normal person. No hidden power, no cliche \"an evil entity is sealed inside my body,\" nothing. \n\nAgain, I have very clear and basic guidelines for my roleplays. I make sure to be clear with the setting of the plot, unless the setting is more flexible and can be set in any time period. However, I've found the only way to truly avoid this is to plan the plot and setting with the other person, rather than create premade plots for people to respond to. Imo, that really sucks, because I want to share ideas that have been clawing at my brain with other people. I just genuinely don't understand what very few people expect when they introduce a character that has nothing to do with the plot or setting. Do they wanna steer it in a different direction? Are they even paying attention? Do they expect their partner to do twenty backflips, hold their breath for ten seconds, spin around in a circle and then do forty jumping jacks to accommodate their character and whatever funky idea they have?",
