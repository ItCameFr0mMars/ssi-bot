            "selftext": "Ahoy there!\n\nWanted to have a short survival horror-adventure, so I created a discord-server with everything needed: lore, races (with the option to bring one of your own as long as it's not op), classes, equipment you'll find on your adventure and even a (stolen) map.\n\nSo I set the whole thing up, post my character, do some fine-tuning to classes and ask the others for their own. They even put in their own ideas, discussed where to start and who played who, so I was excited!\n\nUntil suddenly, they just stopped responding and don't even react to the OoC-chat anymore. Sure, one did the obligatory reassurance that yes, they'll finish their character. But nothing ever came out of it. That was weeks ago and I don't feel like running after everyone involved.\n\nTo be honest, I only want to scrap the entire thing because it's obvious that they don't want to play. But on the other hand, I just don't want to see everything wasted and maybe I could find other players who might be more interested in it. If I invite others, however, what do I tell the already existing players? You didn't want to play, so I replaced you?\n\nMany THX 11-38 in advance for advice. :)",

But, it seemed the harder I tried the more people I got that would ghost me or ask for a roleplay and never try to start one with me. I've even had role players who told me they don't have time to roleplay or weren't interested in roleplay to just turn around and post an ad or respond to an ad about roleplay.\n\nIt just became just..unfun trying to roleplay. When I used to have a lot of fun. Now after I get ghosted or a roleplay just ends flat. I just get very uninterested in roleplay for a very long time. Then when I get interested again it only seems to happen again. \n\nI'm honestly really just thinking about just giving up roleplaying. Even though it was the one of my favorites things to do. It would calm me down to put my headspace into a different person so I didn't have to think about stuff going around in my own life. I hate to lose an amazing outlet something that helps me grow a lot. But, it seems no matter what I do all my roleplay\u2019s just turned dead or end up being ghosted after putting so much effort into them. \n\nWell, thank you for reading.

And we put it on the public server list. We just wanted a few new writers. There are six of us. \n\nA lot of the usual joins and leaves 2 minutes later, that's normal and not really a big deal. But we got two people who had screaming cursing rants at us today. \n\nThe first one was a girl who only sent one message before going off. It went straight from \"Hi\" to calling us homophobic slurs and saying she hoped general harm came to us. Along with other things that are probably not appropriate to repeat. \n\nAnd just a few minutes ago we had a girl who really wanted to role play some monsters from her favorite fandom. We don't allow characters from fandoms. It's completely OC. She rambled about the characters for a little while before the server owner realized that she wasn't just making conversation and she wanted to use them. That's a no. The story is about human beings with superpowers like invisibility and pyrokinesis. These things are massive creatures that destroy entire city blocks. As soon as she hears this she starts telling the poor server owner (who is quite literally the nicest person in existence) that's she's, \"Fucking useless\" and that all of our OCS are edgy edge Lords. She rants and curses for a good 5 minutes before it's too much and she's banned. The whole time my friend was offering to help her understand the plot of our server, or *find a fandom server for her.* \n\nI just don't know anymore. I love group servers and I've been doing them for around a year. I've never run into anyone so nasty much less twice in one day. Is there a place I can advertise?

Honestly, we're not really clicking OOC and I'm not very interested in an RP with their character, but I mean sometimes going through with it gets you some really good results. \n\nSo I'm interested enough to keep the conversation going. They seem cool and then they disappear. I mean, in my mind I'm like good riddance, but I still message them like a week later like hey you straight? You wanna do this? But no response. \n\nRecently I actually closed that dm thread because why have it?\n\nLiterally not even a week after I closed the DM after at least 2 months of silence they're like hey you wanna do this rp with me? I'd never done the genre before so I wasn't sure but was like sure no probs. It starts, they're showing me pictures, we're talking a little. Very cool time. I like their character, the style of the RP. It's fun! \n\nFor like a day. And then silence. They're gone. What's even weirder is that the day they stopped responding they actually had posted something outside of RP. Sending another picture of something pertaining to the rp. Just a strange occurrence. \n\nBut hey, flakers gonna flake. \n\nAnd before someone says maybe they missed my response. I've been trying to reach out to them to no avail.",

            "selftext": "Everyone has a preference in who they enjoy writing when it comes to Marvel characters. I personally enjoy writing Wanda/Scarlett Witch. It's the one character I can connect with and understand on a deeper level, plus I just like her in general and my husband writes as Vision. \n\nAnyway, we got invited to this Marvel server with the knowledge that we could write as Scarlett Witch and Vision. Things were good, everyone was welcoming at first....and then the true colors came out. \n\nIn the general chat for all to see, the admins were going back and forth about how sad they were that one of them wasn't writing as Wanda, but a regular member was taking it. Knowing full and well that we could see what was being said. And if that wasn't enough, they showed screenshots of conversations between one another that showed how mad they were at someone wanting a character that they were hoarding and had been hoarding since they started the server. \n\nThen, whenever we as new members would speak, we'd be ignored. Literally pushed to the side by people that they had known longer and we simply faded into the background. Even when I submitted my character sheet for Wanda, they didn't say anything about mine in any kind of compliment, but they did to others before me. We got tired of it and left. \n\nMy thing is, I understand having friends in a server. I get that. But why would anyone, especially an admin in charge of the whole thing, post screenshots and put in the general chat how upset they were at someone taking a character?",

It just feels like they don't like what you've written so they just change it and hope that you don't correct them and just go along with it.\n\nI read a post on here once a loooooong time ago about how someone kept writing their character as looking entirely different because they weren't attracted to them.

            "selftext": "So a bit of background first. I met this person 4 or 5 months ago after I posted an ad on a different site. They seemed super into the role and were okay with my not so quick responses. We would talk OOC and send eachother memes daily. Though not exactly friends I did enjoy the conversations. Well, all of that came to a halt about 2 months after we started the rp. They were going through some things, I never asked what it was, but gave them time to do whatever they needed to do.\n\nThings were silent for over a month which was never the issue. When they finally messaged me again they apologized and told me everything that they were going through (break up, questioning sexuality, getting on medication, starting college, new job, etc). That all seemed like a lot and I mentioned that they could take more time off if they needed. They said no and that they were ready to rp again. Responses were taking a bit longer than before but I just assumed they were busy. What bothered me was that their characters personality completely changed. From the little OOC talk we had it seemed to match their actual personality irl, which also seemed to change completely. This kinda bothered me but maybe they weren't feeling how they were playing their character. I didn't mention it and we continued on. \n\nOne day they asked if any NSFW things would be happening. Now, I mentioned it in my ad but it had been a few months and maybe they forgot, no big deal. NSFW elements were completely optional, it all depended on my partner and if they were comfortable (and if the characters clicked). They said they wouldn't mind if the characters \"got it on\", we were still quite a bit away from that happening but it was nice to know that the option was on the table. Not long after that, they mentioned they were ace IRL. So I did ask if they were really okay with NSFW stuff and that fade to black was an option (and so was not doing any of it at all). They said it was fine and they had no issue with it, okay cool. \n\nWell, now they seem to be pushing the NSFW stuff after every response. Its not like full on asking for it but just little comments about it. I've been telling them that, \"it will happen when it happens.\" They always agree and drop it, but also mentioned AGAIN that they were indeed asexual. It just seems odd that they mentioned it not once but twice almost right after mentioning the NSFW stuff. With that and their characters sudden personality shift it has changed the dynamic of the role. I feel bad for feeling this way like I don't like the person they have changed into, like I liked them better when they were depressed or whatever. \n\nThis is the first partner I've had that has wanted to do this particular role and also one that hasn't dipped after the first month. I don't want to make them feel bad but I also don't know if I want to continue with things doing a complete 180. I feel like I have tip toe around them in OOC chat because if I tell them that a certain subject makes me uncomfortable they get annoyed and stop talking for multiple days. It just seems like they changed so quickly that I have whiplash. I feel like they went through so much and its been such a short time. \n\nIf I were to bring it up how do I do it in a way that doesn't make me seem like I'm picking them apart? Also if I were to end it how would I do it nicely? Usually when I try to end things nicely it turns into a game of 20 questions which I never know how to answer as I only really end things if OOC behavior bothers me. \n\nTLDR: Partner went through some IRL things and now the OOC talk makes me uncomfortable. Also they changed  their characters personality to mimic their own which now changes the dynamic of the rp.",

            "selftext": "Okay, to address the first part: I've roughly had a new partner for roughly about a month give or take. Things were going great. We were getting on like a house on fire and it's been the first time in years I've been able to write *so much*. But give or take a few weeks ago, their activity's started dipping off which is absolutely driving me nuts. I mean it wouldn't be bad if I expected it, but in their ad they mentioned they were looking for someone who could reply more than twice a day. Maybe I was wrong to assume they would be able to reply more than twice a day; but I keep only getting responses from them once every three days now \\[and that's only because I give them a little nudge as politely as possible\\]. Once every three days is a lot different than the original twice a day response time they were looking for.\n\nI mean is there a polite way for me to bring this up to them? As I'm ngl, I'm super annoyed so my immediate kneejerk instinct is to be a huge asshole about it. I only have about two guesses why they're slower, but I don't want to be an asshole to them about either of those things \\[as it'd be a massive asshole move to bring up either of those things\\]. I mean is there a polite way to ask them why their responses have become a lot less frequent for the past few weeks?\n\nOkay and for those that are either taking hiatuses \\[or who have quit\\], how did you guys know it was time for you to bow out of the rp community (temporarily or otherwise)? I'm just wondering as I can't tell if I should honestly bow out of the rp community right now. It's only confusing as when I manage to find someone I click with, then I'm reminded of *why* I love to rp. I keep getting those tiny little blips that just manage to suck me right back into rping; but then I'm hit with the soulcrushing reality of how hard it is to even keep an awesome rp partner anymore \\[no matter how beautifully you click\\]. It's getting disheartening to meet people I click with for them to end up having to bow out. I'm getting stuck between a weird place where I'm not having a lot of fun with rping anymore but yet I'm still capable of having fun sometimes with rping? It's making it difficult to tell if I should just at least temporarily bow out of the rp community.",

I quite enjoy talking to them about the roleplay. They're interested in the dynamic, further plotting. Etc etc. \n\nNow, for context my character is black. Their character is white. It's a romance too. \n\nOur characters were talking. \nTheir character unable to drive. \nMine driving them around. \n\nMine says : I'll teach you to drive, but I don't mind being your personal chauffeur.\nTheirs says : I'd prefer the chauffer, slave. \n\n(Now this is just a shortened version of it. But basically it's what happened.)\n\nAnd i was STUNNED to say the least. \n\nNot... this white character calling my AA character a SLAVE. His slave. \n\nNow, I brought it up with them. They were apologetic. Said something about how black people in the UK joke about slavery like this, calling people who do things for them slaves. And i was like yeah yeah that's fine like ok just change it please. To which they explain more they didn't realize the implications because of how seriously Americans (me) take slavery... etc etc when really to me it just looked bad because of the races of the characters. Which is why I wanted it changed LMAO. \n\nNot to mention it is in one of my easily forgotten requirements to like not mention slavery or like other really awful things that happen / can happen to people / children. I like to keep things light. \n\nAfter a while i look back on it and laugh because of the absurdity of the situation as I've never had anything like this happen to me in all my like 6 years of roleplaying. \n\nBut they were super apologetic and understood how the dynamic of our characters could make a comment like that worse and they did change it. But it did change the mood of our relationship for like .5 seconds. We're still very cool, so dw. It was just such a random thing that happened!",

            "selftext": "So I get a reply on here about an old DC oc x canon rp post, person's eager for it. We send our details and they befriend me first, so I think cool, I'll just send them a small message, clarifying what rp scenario they're up for, what characters they'd like to play, that sort of thing, not too harsh I made it very brief. I wait...and I wait...and I wait...\n\nIt's been three days, and I have barely seen this person active on on the sites. I messaged them a day ago, asking if they were ok and again, nothing. No clarification what's going on or if they are ok, if they truly want to go on with this rp. I don't know if it's my fault? Because I was the one that started up the convo, they befriended me first and haven't blocked me, so I assume either something's happened or either I didn't appeal before the rp even began. I haven't seen them active either, but that could very well be hiding this. \n\nNow I could well be panicking and something could have happened co-incidentally as we befriended and they're on a hiatus of some sort, or I've been pranked and trolled, as I've been ghosted in the past, but nothing as crazy as before the whole rp even started. Any advice? Should I just assume I've been ghosted or just wait it out and see if maybe something's happened?",

We literally were 3 messages in. THREE. and he told me he didn't vibe with it and he has a gut feeling and could we do something else. I said sure even tho we barely did starters and he \"didn't vibe.\" He said he had a feeling mine was going to be \"to slow.\" I didn't have anymore roles I myself liked so he sent me his list within seconds. All were kinda bordering all sexual so I gave him 2 options I liked. Cool. I redid a whole new character for him and we started. SIX MESSAGES IN, ONLY 6. he told me he didn't vibe with it and wanted to change AGAIN. All of these roles weren't even similar. One was fantasy/anime, one was slice of life and he wanted to change to another fantasy one. Because his \"gut\" told him he didn't vibe with this one either even tho it was HIS ROLE. He even told me he knew he liked his roles because he knew he had \"BIG PLANS.\" Like..so did I for my role? But you shut that down based off 2 messages and a gut feeling. \n\nI'm not crazy for getting annoyed and telling him he wasn't a good rp match for me right? I feel insane. He would message (hey) and leave me in read for 3 hours before telling me he has a gut feeling about the role.",

In no particular order\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Don't push.** If your partner doesn't want to do certain action, don't enforce it. Neither in the direct way, nor in the indirect influences, do **not** coerce your partner to do things that you may really love, but they don't enjoy it. One disappointment and uncomfortable experience costs about a hundred of better ones.\n2. **Don't enforce your preferences.** This concerns the characters themselves. You may love blue eyes or dark curly hair, but don't force it on somebody. Let their character be the truest expression of their state of mind at the current moment, otherwise it would be forced and contrived. \n3. **Don't overattach yourself.** If this is not talked about - do not assume you have strong emotional connection with your partner and do not chase them with feelings and so on, it may scare them off and make things very awkward. Real person may be also very different from the mental image you have built.\n4. **Don't be perfect.** Smells, sweat, and other things exist. Make reality better, but don't erase it, creating a sterile vacuum experience that does not offer that oomph when having action play. It should be pleasant, but also relatable.\n5. **Ask before doing, if you are unsure.** Don't just call them a 'slut' or a 'slave' and so on. It may offend your partner and spoil the mood for some time at least, if not worse. Better have OOC chat and ask if it would be okay before proceeding.\n6. **Expect that mood may be different, make compromise.** If one wants  vanilla experience and another one feels like they like it rough - have compromise and discuss or find the middle ground. Do not let you or other short-lived desires to bite off the potential good experience you will gain. \n7. **No harm in saying 'No' and 'Thank you, but we will not fit'.** Shy is okay, but reserved and self-harmful is not. If you are not feeling the connection and do not feel that RP is working out, don't make both of you suffer. Just say politely that it is time to stop \u2013 nobody owes you anything and you do not owe anybody anything.\n\nThank you for reading and stay civil! Friendly and polite goes further than horny, but angry and miserable in the short-run. Stay safe.",

No hint whatsoever they're just fucking with me. \n\nI don't even know how to politely tell them that won't work.

I struggle to have a backbone and reject them, and end up sacrificing my own happiness as a result.\n\nI don't like making people upset, but when I eventually ghost them or admit that I'd rather play with someone else (if not a lot of people came around lately) or just wanna take a break, their reactions vary wildly from \"Oh yeah, I totally understand\" to \"OK fine, be that way\". In a way it sort of turns into a \"boy who cried wolf\" situation.\n\nJust about an hour ago I was playing with this one guy who wanted various topics I wasn't particularly comfortable with, and as a result I just kinda kept pushing on even though I wasn't having a lot of fun (although the RP itself was OK, it wasn't really what I was looking for or interested in), and I wasn't willing to tell him how I felt. I eventually ghosted him for about 30-40 minutes before eventually admitting that I wanted to call it off for now, and that there was someone else who came around that I wanted to brainstorm with, and I struggle to juggle. I guess he thought I thought he was low-priority or something and acted all dismissive, saying stuff like \"Fine. Have a good night then. Go ahead and brainstorm with them.\" I tried to talk to him, and ask why he was so upset, but apparently I was supposed to know what I did wrong right away? I'm autistic, and as a result I have difficulty understanding why other people feel the way they do and I need a little clarification. In retrospect I suppose it should've been a bit more obvious to me. If I was ghosted and dismissed by a partner I liked to play with, I'd be upset too. But I'd at least talk about it.\n\nI'll admit, I made some mistakes myself. But is it too much to ask for an honest discussion about what's upsetting you? Maybe that's a little hypocritical to say, because I was pretty vague about how I felt toward him myself. I guess this is a taste of my own medicine. I need to grow more of a backbone and say \"NO\" to things that I don't like or wanna do, and not get roped into almost making friends with people and living a lie in the process.\n\nI hope you understand what I'm going through, and any constructive responses, no matter how harsh, would be quite helpful.",

            "selftext": "I've been in a roleplay messenger group for about one or two years, a somewhat large group but it's funny to talk there, especially when I've made some great friends. Weeks ago, one of them asked to recruit more people, which was going to do his cousin, but because the country where they live don't have great things, I had to do it myself, ending with 2 new persons and here we go.\n\nHere are the cast:\n\n* Matthew: One of the admins, he can be misunderstood when joking and be slow when roleplaying, but when he finishes, his characters and text can be so good. Also, one of his characters is the antagonist.\n* Haru: Hard otaku, one of the admins and Matthew cousin, despite his love for the Japanese culture he's been evolving until being a great roleplayer. His characters are also very good ones, just need to improve more. He's the one who asked for a recruitment.\n* Cecy: Part of the friends' group and I have a great friendship with her. She can have problems when talking with new ones, but we've managed to overcome that. Other than that, her characters are somewhat important in the role, and making their way to be stronger because of lore or just because they have strong relations with strong characters.\n* Me: One of the admins and maybe the most active on the group, I always try to help others inside the group and be kind. My characters are said to be very good ones and creative, because I tend to introduce new concepts to the role.\n* Zan: The first new and is very helpful on these days\n* Kevin: The second new and the problem one\n* Other persons who are part of the role, but not so important for the story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I've promoted the role as a creative one, where you can exploit your imagination but also has the importance of communicate with others about what you're going to do, so we can know how to manage it and if it's accepted or not, more importantly with the admins, because we are the one who manages the lore and things like characters' buffs and nerfs. We have some OCs which we consider OPs because of their origin, power and/or species, these are 8 from 28 characters:  \nFrom the weaker to the strongest:\n\n* A necromancer who found the immortality to avoid being send to the Limbo due his demon blood as descendant of hybrids, and now want to find revenge for his wife (Haru)\n* One of The Three Greats, the reincarnated woman who became an angel because of her soul merged with an archangel, capable of killing thousands of demons in change of her life (mine)\n* An archdemon who woke up and wanted to find a way to free his species. Was the one who freed the antagonist (another guy)\n* One of The Three Greats who trained as an assassin by an organization and battled in the Great War, without knowing, was cared by people with demon blood and he's the same Limbo (Haru)\n* A Chinese immortal phoenix with absolute power over the fire, and now came back to his home long after the Great War happened (mine)\n* The last one of The Three Greats, the woman with multiple magical swords who sacrificed herself to protect the seal, and with that, she was ascended to be an angel and the capacity to seal other creatures (Matthew)\n* The first human ascended to archangel, with is soul merged with the reincarnation woman and despite the limitations, was the one who created the power to delete demons (mine)\n* The antagonist, a fallen archangel after seeing the injustices of the angels and archangels, sealed away by The Three Greats and the archangel, but he has the power of another unknown and destructive place where he was sealed (Matthew)\n\nThis is important to take account what was the power from the characters we considered OP, and despite that there are some who were defeated because their personality or ingenuity of their opponents, for example: My phoenix was stopped 2 times because he was calmed down, the first time by his boyfriend (singing) and the second time by one fo The Three Greats (casting a hallucination of his happiest memory).\n\nAnd even when saying that 2 of them are immortal... technically they aren't, the better term is demi-immortal because both have a way or other to be killed, and still if they can't be killed that doesn't mean they can't be defeated.\n\nReturning to the story, Zan asked about adding a new species, which their powers is about casting an emotive aura and being capable to persuade others with that same aura, and not always they can control it. I didn't saw it as a problem, because Zan told when she proposed that in other role, it was negated because \"It was so OP\", and till this day I don't see where is that thing of \"OP\".\n\nWhen she sent her character sheet, the admins present in that moment we LOVED HER, we liked how creative and good character was hers, and we accepted with no doubt, and still, I didn't see where was the problem, because even if she could attack you, your character can counterattack with no problems, it wasn't mind control, just manipulation.\n\nAnd meanwhile we were talking wonders about her, the other new, Kevin was... absent, the first time he talked, Cecy wanted to help him but he replied rudely with \"I don't care\", and I couldn't warn him because he never was present, and that happened when I wasn't online, causing to Cecy had her problems about socialize with news more present, so I've tried to calm her and making see that it wasn't her fault and he can't do those things, especially with strangers.\n\nI never saw him on the group again until today. I was playing The Binding of Isaac until I paused the game and saw the notification, it was about the character sheet's group and thought \"Oh, must be Haru's new character!\" because Haru was revamping one of his characters and... no, it was Kevin's character and... I even swore where was God when saw the sheet, and I'm an agnostic.\n\nHis sheet was 2 messages long, most of the sheet was about skills and techniques his OC had, to take account, the max quantity of characters Facebook has is 20,000, and everything was wrong with the OC, starting with he was 13 years old assassin and someway was a master in a sword technique based on the **ATOMS**, which is impossible because... they must be aware about how atoms work, and even applied Newton's second law when the role has a technology from around the medieval era.\n\nHis 13 years old character had **A LOT OF TECHNIQUES, a VERY LONG LIST OF TECHNIQUES, EACH ONE EXPLAINED AND EVEN THE COMBINATIONS BETWEEN THEM**, it was ridiculous for someone who was so young, and worst, because he was **10 TIMES FASTER THAN** ***USAIN BOLT***, and he had a strength about 20kg in his arms and 60kg in his legs, and wouldn't be bad **IF HE HADN'T MULTIPLE AND WITHOUT RESTRICTION TECHNIQUES WHICH BUFFS HIS STATS, MAKING HIM RIDICULOUSLY STRONG AND FAST**, even Haru commented that he could go to the **SPEED OF THE SOUND**.\n\nHaru's Great (his strongest character) is very old, has a look of someone around his 20s or 30s but he participated in the Great War, which was around 50 years before the role started, and still this day his OC has an unknown age, well... despite being part of a famous organization of his kingdom since childhood and being actually the leader... that Gary Stu **COULD BEAT HIM EASLY, BECAUSE WAS STRONGER THAN THE THREE GREATS TOGETHER BEING ONLY 13 YEARS OLD.**\n\nRemember when said that the correct term to use in the necromancer and the phoenix wasn't immortal, but demi-immortal? Well, they can die if their soul or physical body is destroyed, and the better example is my phoenix, because it's like an ash's golem, has soul and works magically, if his ashes are separated until it couldn't retake his form, he would die if there aren't enough reunited ashes in a long time, and also his soul isn't own, but from a fragment from the nature's deity Mother Nature soul, and because it's chaotic nature could in any time kill the phoenix and take back the fragment.\n\nSomething similar can happen to the necromancer, I don't know how because isn't my character, but also must have a physical body or he dies and well... **EVERYBODY HAS ATOMS**, **EVERYTHING HAS A T O M S.** Some characters abilities can have some weakness or exceptions, **BUT GARY STU'S ABILITIES DON'T,** even I think he could kill **MOTHER NATURE, the last ALIVE DEITY who could INSTAKILL YOU OR MODIFY YOUR BODY FOR BEING ALIVE.** That was the power of his character.\n\nBUT WAIT! **THERE'S MORE.** Because he also has a story...! And not a good one. Fully of plot-holes and not good ones because of how he putted everything a measure and his \"Physic skills\", here a list of some of them:\n\n1. Why instead of torturing him because he wanted didn't to be an assassin, just kill him and have another child? If you torture your child, you can't say you love him so much, didn't they have more children?\n2. Why he doesn't want to kill people but still kill his family and still is working as an assassin even with his family dead?\n3. Why he mourns for his family when they are the one who tortured him?\n4. How he could master that difficult technique being so young and still having social life? Because he even went to school.\n5. Where the hell he knew his girlfriend, why he liked her and why they killed her? HE'S A CHILD.\n6. Why he couldn't suicide despite even cutting himself but can still his family when they are STRONGER than him because of AGE (and they are the one training him).\n7. Why he's happy because he isn't the last one of his family? THEY TORTURED YOU AND YOU KILLED THEM.\n8. How the hell the parents are so intelligent to train the kid until his max capacities, but be so dumb to don't think that torture him could make kill them and quit the assassin job?\n9. He was trained since he could walk, and saying they didn't care so much of him to even torture the child, how he hasn't some disabilities? One of the controversies of the Strongest kid in the world is that the extensive could damage him seriously,\n10. Can someone tell me how his girlfriend isn't pedo when you must have at least 16 or 17 to help the army? I doubt all the thing of the girlfriend occurred in one year at his 13, and all this happened AFTER THE GREAT WAR.\n11. Why the kingdom would ask to a 10-13 years old kid to kill someone? \n12. In which kingdom he lived?! There's no info about where at least he's living and NO KINGDOM WOULD ACCEPT HIM, NOT EVEN THE MOST WARLIKE KINGDOM.\n\nAn also wanted to assert a part of lore where the humans almost got extinct, BUT WAIT! The humans NEVER were in danger to become extinct because they have all the recurses to be stronger, and also the help of angels, archangels and human hybrids, however, it's canon that the humans hunted so many dragons that now it's ALMOST IMPOSIBLE TO SEE A DRAGON IN WILDERNESS, how the hell the humans will become extinct?!\n\nAnd also, he can defy a god... being a HUMAN KID.\n\nWith all this I've passed the sheet to Matthew, Cecy and Haru, and they were in agreed with one thing: **This character** ***SHOULDN'T BE IN THE ROLE.***\n\nAfter knowing this, I've notified Kevin that his character cannot be in the role (and neither in others) and putting the most important reasons his character was rejected, and then he saw the message, the answer? \"I didn't read it all, anyways\" and then he deleted his messages, his character sheet and quitted from the group without asking if he could make another character, he just quitted.\n\nSo, knowing he was gone from the role, I've tried to unfriend him but... couldn't saw his profile, then I've tried to enter his profile with one of the messenger options and big surprise! HE BLOCKED ME IN FACEBOOK!\n\nAfter knowing that, we've laughing so much about that, and maybe from now and after, he and his character will be a meme in the group.\n\nI would pass some images about his character sheet but nobody took a screenshot about those moments before he deleted it, and also, we're Latin-Americans, so our native language is Spanish and I can't translate all that character sheet without asking myself why I am doing it, so yeah, at least imagine that the character had a Nanatsu no Taizai character image. I don't know who because I don't see it and I'm not planning to see the anime, but I recognized the style.\n\nAnd fellow reader, thanks for reading all this horror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.D: After that, Cecy was supported emotionally and became admin. :D",

            "selftext": "Recently an old acquaintance got in touch with me.  An interest in RP was one of the things we had in common, so we chitchatted about that, and since he seemed interested in what I was doing I linked him an RP profile of mine, which had writing samples and other info on it.  I'm a novella style writer who replies a few times a day, usually around ten paragraphs.  He's a line/single para RPer.\n\nAnd... he combed through my writing samples pointing out the pettiest mistakes I had made, then proceeded to complain about everything he doesn't like about novella style RP, and suggested I make a profile on a website for line RP.  He also implied that a lack of faceclaims on my profile is holding me back from finding partners.  (Which is intentional, because I don't like them, and I don't want to RP with people who use them.)\n\nYes, I am aware my writing samples have mistakes in them.  I've left them there because they are samples from live RP, and I hate it when people send me highly polished samples that don't reflect what their RP posts are really like.  I'm trying not to falsely advertise myself.  And it feels real fresh for someone whose idea of a good response is \"He sat on the cushion and smiled\" to criticize my writing when I didn't ask for feedback in the first place.\n\nThis exchange happened over e-mail and I think, unfortunately, I'm not going to reply to him and just let this would-be rekindling of our friendship fizzle.  I just needed a place to vent because I am not going to say all of this to him.",

            "selftext": "My friend and I need some help. \n\nFair warning, this is long \n\nTo start off, we've been writing together for years. He has his own set of worlds and lore while I have mine, and over the years, we combined our lore and expanded both of our universes. For convenience sake, we'll call this friend Dan (not his real name). \n\nOur universes consist of fantastical kingdoms, each on their own world and consisting of countless different species. They all have their own technology, magic, politics, culture, so on and so forth. Before we go further, I'd like to stress the fact that our genre is heavy/high fantasy. \n\nSometimes, when we're in a VC with other people, we'd have a bit of small talk or make some inside jokes about our combined universes. One of our other friends who participated in these VCs grew a bit curious about it and began asking questions. We'll call him Tim (not his real name). We happily and enthusiastically answered these questions. Eventually, we asked him if he wanted to join, since we could tell he had a lot of interest in the lore we put together. He said yes and was extremely excited to get involved. \n\nAt first, he sort of spectated us to get the gist of what we were writing. We were on board with this 100%, since it wouldn't really be fair if he was just thrown into the fire without knowing what was going on in the story. \n\nTim came up with an idea for a small settlement of humans in one of Dan's worlds, which at the time, was being rules by a tyrant. This settlement would be a sort of rebellion against the tyranny, consisting of knights, mages, clerics, scouts, etc. all serving under a force of light. It started out about as big as a settlement from the Fallout games. We were all excited to see this settlement in the story, and perhaps they could go from a settlement to a much stronger city. \n\nThat's exactly what it started out as: A settlement, a group of humans trying to survive under the tyranny in one of the most barren, near-uninhabitable places in this particular world. They had just enough weapons and magic to protect themselves. To start incorporating them into the story, one of my characters, who was scouting the area, came across this settlement. For a bit more context, one of my worlds is a kingdom dedicated to protecting humans and natural law, ruled by the grim reaper. This is vaguely important just a bit later. Seeing that these people were humans, my character went to investigate, and long story short, after some interaction, an alliance was struck. The settlement offered to lend their magic and weapons to aid in taking down the world's tyrant and his armies. \n\nFast forward a bit and the settlement starts dividing, mainly because my kingdom ruled by what's considered a dark lord, and many of the humans in the settlement weren't quite pleased with that. Not only that, but they didn't want to get involved in such an overwhelmingly large war, even if it meant eliminating the one who caused so much suffering. I personally like this sort of arc, since in a way, it could cause the settlement to start expanding or moving to get away from the alliance and the war. However, this is where it begins to go downhill. \n\nWe have our scenes split up between places. A group of characters will be on one world, then they go to the next. For a large part of this, my characters would leave Tim's characters alone, since the tyrant of Dan's world had eyes on them, and my characters didn't want to lead him to Tim's characters. I feel like this is what Dan and I might have done wrong, since Tim wouldn't exactly be able to express his characters' progress without talking to himself.\n\nIt felt like overnight, the settlement went from a medium-sized group of people to entire cities. I don't mean ruined cities made from dirt and mud, I mean populated, well-developed, well-off cities. Keep in mind, in the roleplay, this was over several months, when it normally takes YEARS to build even one city. Not to mention, how could their population grow so quickly? Not only that, but suddenly, the settlement had even more weapons and technology than they had before. Again, Dan and I absolutely don't mind the settlement expanding into a more dominant force. In fact, we encourage it. However, this was so abrupt and out-of-the-blue that we genuinely didn't know the settlement's story, nor were we able to keep up with it. We brought this up to Tim, telling him that if we wanted to add so many things, then he should at least ask, especially since this is Dan's world with its own lore. We wanted to make sure everything goes together, and if it doesn't, then we can find a way to make all of our ideas compatible with each other. Tim understood and accepted. But that didn't change anything. \n\nThere were still things being added without our knowledge. It was getting to a point where my kingdom's assistance wasn't needed and the area of Dan's world where the \"settlement\" was located was no longer being controlled by Dan in terms of lore. He had ideas for parts of these areas, but now he couldn't put these ideas on the table because the entire area was being controlled by such dominant city-states, and he didn't know all of this was being added. To get to the next point, the tyrant was overthrown and the settlement was divided, one part resenting the dark lord they had been working with to eliminate the tyrant and the other part wanting to progress and develop further, even possibly improving relations with the kingdom who had allied with them. While this division was between the more magic-based part of the settlement (might just start calling it an entire faction at this point) and the technologically-based part, any mention of magic was out the window. There was no magic or any more cool, original technology or weapons. The original idea for this settlement just kinda... vanished. \n\nThe next and current major interaction between all of our characters is the civil war in the faction. There's no mages or clerics anymore. Now it's literally just the American civil war. Bayonets, mortars, soldiers loaded in trucks like sardines, underage men being sent to fight, so on and so forth. Let me just stress the fact that again, the starting population was small, only about a few hundred people, maybe close to a thousand, and less than a year later, there were enough people for the equivalent of the American civil war. \n\nMy character, the princess of the allied kingdom, and two of Dan's characters, who are heavily trained warriors went to check on the faction (the part that valued their assistance). They spoke to their leader, found the current state they were in, then were asked to fight alongside them in the civil war. Our characters reluctantly agreed, only \"reluctantly\" because they're going through a war of their own, and they're not sure if it would be worth dying for a faction that's tearing at the seams. \n\nThis is where we sort of started to call Tim out on a couple things. In the next few scenes, we allowed Tim to narrate. Again, let me mention that Dan's characters are well-trained warriors who have survived a few wars in the past, with one of them surviving a couple assassination attempts. They're part of a species that has strength and endurance far greater than a human's, which is only amplified by their training and decades of experience. They do have their own weaknesses and struggles, but Dan wasn't able to express what they were. The reason being that when Tim was narrating, he put an obstacle in front of our characters, but instead of allowing us to figure out a way around such an obstacle, Tim would decide how our characters handle it. For example, they had to cross some murky water, and since it was too wide to go around quickly, they had to swim through it. Dan's characters would have been able to do so, though having to use some extra strength to keep themselves going with their armor. However\" instead of letting Dan write how his characters would handle swimming across, Tim decides that Dan's characters would struggle, get exhausted, and start sinking. Dan tried to have his characters push through, but Tim pushed the idea that Dan's characters would sink. I had to have my character take the form of a bird and start lifting Dan's characters back to the surface of the water. But Tim decided that somehow, even though my character wasn't touching the water herself, she'd start sinking because her feathers would get heavy when they're wet (???) I mentioned that birds are actually very light animals, and the large majority of them can float on water if they don't allow themselves to fully go in. If they do somehow get stuck in water, they're not gonna sink like a rock. Tim's excuse was that a feather pillow gets heavy when it's wet, when a feather pillow is several pounds heavier than a bird. Oh, let me also mention that Tim's side characters, who were human soldiers with a bunch of equipment as well, got past the water and even some barbed wire just fine, even though Tim had mentioned that a large majority of them were young and had barely finished training. \n\nWhen Tim started telling Dan that his characters would struggle to run because of their armor, that's when I butted in. I nudged towards the issue that Tim was putting a challenge in front of us, which normally isn't an issue, but then he decides how we handle that challenge, which isn't fun for any of us. I mentioned that Dan's characters were asked to join because of their strength and experience, and if they couldn't even swim across some water, what were they there for? He's implying that they can't even use their immense strength and endurance to good use when they need it. Tim said I could have been a bit nicer (which I admit, I absolutely should have been more gentle in my approach), but he said fine. He said that he felt like he couldn't put a challenge in front of us, to which Dan and I disagreed. We said throw hell itself at our characters, but at least allow US to decide what OUR CHARACTERS do and what they will struggle with. We told him to trust us not to godmod and just shrug everything off, because Dan and I know that's not fun for anyone involved. When Dan and I were talking in private with each other, he mentioned that this is Tim's narrating style in the previous stories they did together. \n\nTim continued to say that he felt like he wasn't allowed to expand his settlement either. Again, Dan and I disagreed with him. We told him he just kept adding stuff without asking us or telling us how the settlement was doing. We didn't get into how we were a bit troubled by the fact that the original idea for the settlement just seemed to disappear, and now our fantasy ideas for it turned into a run-of-the-mill civil war roleplay, since our conversation ended there last night.\n\nWe want to continue writing with him, and we want this settlement to be a thing in our story. However, with the way it's going now, Dan doesn't even want to make it canon, since he's considering inviting more people to write with us. At this point, he's worried that this sudden civil war plot would interfere with whatever we would plan in the future, or it would interfere with others who wanted to join. I want to help Tim develop his settlement, but I genuinely don't know how do to that without feeling like I'm discouraging him or dictating what he can and can't do. \n\nTell me what we're doing wrong, what we could do better, or how we might be able to go over this together. I want all of us to have fun writing this, but the thing that's crippling us is lack of communication. Any and all advice is welcome.",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, the wording of the title is very deliberate. It was not the roleplayer's character, but the roleplayer himself.\n\nEarlier today a guy I met in a roleplay group chat hit up my DMs. He had initially seemed kinda charmingly quirky, so I humored him and told him I was searching for RP partners. We discussed characters for a bit before he broached a sexual topic. I immediately clarified that I never do sex RPs. I figured hey, maybe he'll respect that and it doesn't have to be an issue. Some people need to be told before they'll engage their family-friendly filter. A bit later he posts his results from an ERP preference quiz to me. I take the opportunity to once again remind him I'm not really into that sort of thing. I'm not particularly offended that he's being a bit vulgar. I'm more just... making sure he hasn't forgotten this isn't a topic I'm interested in. I don't want there to be any misunderstandings if we do get around to roleplaying.\n\nNot long later, he sends me a weird link accompanied by \"Hehe. Have fun\". I click it and it brings me to a weird pink User Interface with no text whatsoever on the web page. All it has is a few sliders with symbols on them I don't recognize. This is kind of bizarre to me because seriously, when's the last time you saw a website without a single letter on it? Not even a logo. So I just kinda assumed my phone wasn't loading it properly or something. I reply with \"Huh?\"\n\nHis response is \"Are you sure you want me to tell you?\"\n\nI say \"I mean yeah. This website isn't working for me. &gt;w&lt;\" \n\nHe posts another weird link under the same domain. After I click it I get the same interface. I mess with the sliders a bit just to see if I could get the website to do something. Nothing really happens on my end? He messages me back with \"Good girl\".\n\nI'm thoroughly confused as to what this weird website is and why he's being so annoyingly cryptic. I reply with \"Yeah I don't get it\" and go to google up the name of the site and see if Google has any information on wtf this site is. I find the home page for the site and it's the home page for a remote control sex toy with internet connectivity being advertised as a way to \"spice up your long-distance relationship\". At about this time I realized that the sliders in that UI were controlling the toy. I came back to a \"Don't stop\" before I called him out, blocked and reported him.\n\nSo uh--Today I learned that it is possible to sexually assault someone over the internet. I'm genophobic by the way. I get anxiety attacks if I so much as try to write a makeout scene. My stomach feels like a fucking rock and at this rate I don't think I'm going to be getting much sleep tonight. I just wanted to approach roleplaying with an inviting, kind, and tolerant attitude so that maybe some people would stick around and write with me and this shit happens to me.\n\nI hope y'all're having a better night than I am.",

            "selftext": "For characters I love (which is far and few now), I'll write a billion different drafts for them and edit them or throw out old backstories for years. Now, whenever I make a new character for someone's role-play, it just feels like a drag to keep playing them.\n\nI can't seem to put the same effort into making a new character anymore. I'd rather just write as the same character in different settings over and over again, but I feel like that's kinda looked down upon in the community. There are some characters I have that I could play over and over again and never grow bored of them- But whenever I try to make a new character I just lose interest or forget about them. \n\nMaybe it's because I've put so much heart and soul into the characters I've kept that new ones simply don't compare. Writing descriptive character takes a lot of time and effort, and it often goes unappreciated in the circles I'm in. I used to hate that some of my role-play partners clearly never bothered to even read my character templates, but I keep making them for me instead of them. I really like to write a lot of information for my ocs even if it's frustrating at times. \n\nA lot of role-players now don't even seem to bother making them, they just make a name tag with some pretty visuals. Sometimes I wish I got into the habit of doing that rather than making a long detailed form for my character, but if descriptive characters didn't exist there'd be no joy in reading character templates. I love reading long character forms, I just wish I could find the inspiration to keep writing them myself.",
