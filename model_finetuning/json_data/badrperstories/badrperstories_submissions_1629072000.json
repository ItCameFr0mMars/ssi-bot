            "selftext": "Not sure if anyone else has ever been through this, but Ijust need to vent.  \n\n\nSo, a while ago i was RPing with someone about Berserk. The RP went downhill because the replies to the RP could take weeks with no OOC chat, which very much begins to drain even though the RP itself was great, and I decided to let my partner know OOC I wasn't enjoying it and I bowed out. Then, after Miura's death, he messaged me again, saying \"even though you ghosted me, i do want to continue the RP\". I never ghosted, since i said I'd be going, but I said sure, since I do love Berserk and wanted to RP.  \n\n\nCut to now, and its happened again. Multiple times in the past 3 months my partner has disappeared for weeks with no OOC chat. They come back, RP again with one reply a day for a couple of weeks, then they disappear again and the loop repeats. They come online on discord, so they're online and able to respond, but they choose not to. Even if they just put in OOC \"not feeling it rn\" or \"in a bad place\" i could cope with that, but being made to wait with no communication is very annoying.   \n\n\nI feel like i'm being taken for a ride here and it's very much pissing me off. I waited 5 months for one partner when he was sick, because he let me know beforehand, but when people just disappear with no words expecting me to just be ok with it, i feel like my patience is being taken advantage of.   \n\n\nHas anyone else had a partner like this? Is there anything I can do to repair the RP?",

I will not carry the story, this is 50/50 and more often than not I\u2019m the one that has to carry. \n\n2. OOC chatter. I love, adore, becoming friends with my partners but some see it as an invitation to flirt and the such,but don\u2019t leave the rp on the back burner to do that. I want to write as well as be friends but the rp is the main focus. \n\n3. Trying to control my character. I don\u2019t mind steering the scene elsewhere but don\u2019t change something major in my character. \n\n4. Most just want to write smut, which is fine, but again not the main focus unless stated otherwise. \n\n5.

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow roleplayers! I'm feeling all sorts of conflicted about this situation, and I think I just need to vent it out. I hope I can get some advice on the situation too. For context, this is a zombie apocalypse RP and here are the characters...\n\nBruce (24M) - He is an excellent driver who is being forced to work for the bad guys in a town. He only does this to keep his little brother safe. Also, he is my character. \n\nRachel (22F) - Bruce's best friend for years. She has two siblings and works as a maid for the bad guys living in the same town. \n\nHarvey (23M) - Leader of a good guy group. \n\nSelina (24F) - She is a member of Harvey's group and excellent with fixing cars. She and Rachel share the same author. \n\nOur story begins with Rachel being screamed at by her boss, not wanting to be bothered. Bruce appears and checks up on his friend, deciding to cheer her up by bringing her out of town. They hang out and are about to kiss. The moment is interrupted by a new bad guy (we'll call him Bane), who makes Bruce drive him and Rachel back into town. \n\nThe next day, Bruce is forced to go out on a mission with Bane. They encounter a large group of zombies, and Bruce is forced to leave Bane behind. \n\nAt the same time, Harvey was brought into the town after being captured. He ends up fighting the bad guys and liberates the whole town. He also has a flirty encounter with Rachel. The seeds for their ship are planted, and her author is intrigued about a triangle happening. Someone jumps in and suggests that Bruce can end up with Selina if he doesn't end up with Rachel. And so, it was decided by the author that Rachel would have Harvey and Bruce could have Selina. \n\nI didn't mind that Bruce could be with Selina (since their face claims were together in a movie), but I was also intrigued by him and Rachel since it felt like a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn the story, Bruce returns to town and finds it liberated. He is brought into questioning by the kind mayor, and he is released shortly after. He then sees Rachel and they catch up. \n\nA few days pass, and Harvey has brought in his group. Everyone is getting acquainted, and Bruce meets Selina for the first time. They actually start to have a friendship due to a shared love for old music. Meanwhile, Rachel and Harvey are together and end up sleeping with each other that night. \n\nThe next day, Bruce goes over to Rachel's house and finds her with Harvey. He is shocked! Selina comes over immediately after to warn them about a horde of zombies coming their way, so Bruce goes into rescue mode to rescue his and Rachel's siblings. \n\nI do love Bruce and Selina, but I also feel like the situation was a bit rushed with Rachel and Harvey. She even said at one point that she was feeling things for him that she had never felt with Bruce. It kinda makes me feel sad how it went down, and it makes my character feel rejected. Sometimes, I find myself yearning for Bruce and Rachel to happen. And sometimes, I feel like the author ships Rachel and Harvey more than Bruce and Selina. \n\nHow in the world can I cope?",

I waited a week before asking him how everything is, and it was only when I message him did he tell me he wouldn\u2019t be active for a month. \n\nI would\u2019ve been fine with this if he had told me earlier on, but his excuse is something he would\u2019ve been aware of well in advance.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, so I\u2019m back. So I\u2019m not sure if some of you remember some of my earlier posts, but I talked about a couple of the issues I was having with my three current partners. Although I\u2019m definitely not out of the woods yet with all of them, I really just wanted to focus on one today, \u201cPaige.\u201d I\u2019m sorry if this is super long. \n\nFor some of you who didn\u2019t happen to read my post from around a month ago, I had a couple of partners who were \u201cfizzing.\u201d One of them was Paige. Although initially in our relationship it wasn\u2019t smooth sailing, I grew to really love her and our roleplay. However, lately I\u2019ve noticed she had been growing distant. I knew she had a lot going on her life, but at the same time she repeatedly assured me everything was okay and fine. After getting advice and thinking over it, I decided to stay with her. However, she got even more distant, to the point I knew she was online and talking to others. She would often ignore me for hours. \n\nOf course I totally understand that life happens and that roleplaying is a hobby. I experienced a lot of family and friend issues during this period as well. However, I made sure to communicate this to my partners or just giving them a heads up. Paige gave me little to nothing of this. I also didn\u2019t enjoy feeling akin to a stalker seeing if she was online or not. She was in a different time zone, and I wasn\u2019t going to waste anymore sleep trying to see if she would give me the time of day or not. I\u2019ll be honest, I was pissed.\n\nI love Paige and she\u2019s a great person, but I hated how she made me feel over the whole thing. If she wanted to cut it off, that\u2019s fine. It would be hurt, but it was better than being dragged along. If her issues were so great she didn\u2019t even want to contact me for a bit, that\u2019s fine as well. I get it, I really do. If you need a break, you need a break. I\u2019ve taken plenty of them myself. However, not getting me a heads up was what pissed me off the most. \n\nSo I decided on taking a break from Discord. To see if she even gave a flying fuck of my disappearance. Petty, I know. But I was on vacation and I didn\u2019t want to think about it any longer. So my immense disappointment, she contacted me a couple of times but that was it when I came back four days later. Before, if this did happen, she would always ask me if everything was okay. Now, it seemed like she could care less. I was heartbroken. I gave up. \n\nI know what I did next was childish and stupid, but I left all the servers we shared and cut off contact. I was done. I was about to head to bed when she immediately asked me what was up. I told her I would talk to her in the morning. I honestly did not except her to respond right way. Not only that, but she was also super distressed about it. She basically told me that she was glad that I at least gave her a heads up before ghosting her. Although I was angry she was the one accusing me of ghosting, I knew that she was sincere and really upset I left our servers. \n\nSo the next morning I apologize and tell her I was just super upset about her being distant and not giving me a head ups. I profusely apologized but also was vague on the reasons why I left. She told me she cried after I left and didn\u2019t want to lose me. She also did some touching things when I came back that made me sob. She explained a lot of things were happening to her at the moment, and apologized for being distant. She didn\u2019t want to involve me in her problems. I happily accepted her apology. I thought everything was good. Until it wasn\u2019t. \n\nEven though she\u2019s definitely not as distant as before, I notice she wasn\u2019t quite as active either.  That\u2019s fine. I totally get it. However, it\u2019s recently starting to regress to where it was. So far it isn\u2019t  as bad as it was before my departure, but it still feels like I\u2019m being put on the back burner. It\u2019s hard to describe. Almost like I\u2019m more of an afterthought. Like I\u2019m nothing more than an annoying pest and she\u2019s just trying to be nice by  replying. Am I exaggerating? Probably. Are past bad experiences clouding my judgement? There\u2019s a good chance. \n\nCouple of other things happened. Although she\u2019s happy to talk about a possible separate roleplay, it seems like she\u2019s lost interest in our main one. It\u2019s weird. She doesn\u2019t like to talk about it even when I mention it, but sometimes she brings it up and talks and jokes about the story and our characters. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s just humoring me by talking about it, or she is interested and again I\u2019m being paranoid. \n\nI\u2019ve asked her on several occasions if she wanted to continue and she always expresses that she does. The main reason I suspect her loosing interest is because before we could talk about head cannons for hours for this role play, now it seems like she wants to avoid the subject. At the same time, she\u2019s still replying as she did before to the main one. Am I making too big of a deal?\n\nShe also has seemed less interested about what I have to say in our OOC chats. Sometimes she just rants about her life and I only seem to inconvenience her when I talk about my own. It was never like this before. I don\u2019t mind her ranting a couple of times and me just listening, but it seems like it\u2019s happening more and more often. The more it happens, the more it feels like I inconvenience her. Again, could I be wrongly interrupting all this? Yes. I very well could be. At the same time I\u2019ve roleplayed enough to notice some of the signs of disinterest. \n\nI also have been growing more concerned because of Paige\u2019s new behavior reminds me of an old partner of mine (yes the one who wanted me to glorify the Holocaust with her). Not any cause for concern for now, and I know they\u2019re hardly alike\u2026. Paige is kind and extremely sweet. She doesn\u2019t do anything to make me uncomfortable. If anything she avoids telling me things to make me more comfortable. My old partners was the opposite. But still. I can\u2019t shake the feeling.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure what to do. It seems like Paige really does care about me. I think she wants me to stay and continue communicating with her. Otherwise she would of not bothered to contact me after I initially left. However, at the same time I have been growing increasingly uncomfortable. Like something bad is going to happen or she will do something my old partner did to me. \n\nThanks for reading this story. I will be happy with any advice I can get.",

            "selftext": "Link to the original post: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/p64zzw/dealing_with_a_jealous_roleplayer/)\n\nShort summary: There's a jealous roleplayer in my WoW guild that only wanted her roleplay partner for herself and got mad when he started roleplaying with me. \n\nSo! I found out that this has only been about five days since my original post lol. But quite a bit has happened since. \n\nOriginally I thought things were going pretty well. Susan had started roleplaying with one of Micheal's irl friends and I thought she was pretty content with that. I felt like things were at peace. I was going to talk to Micheal about Susan's behavior like you guys had suggested, but stuff in my personal life came up so there was some time where I wasn't even online to talk to him. \n\nAnd then last night, shit hit the fan. A friend of ours posted an advertisement for a roleplay event she was going to run. It was an IC wrestling tournament, and I commented that I couldn't wait and I jokingly said that I was excited to see my in-game husband fight. Our characters aren't married, but since Micheal is the only person I'm roleplaying a ship with in the game, I figured I'd just say he was my in-game husband for the lols. After that, I told the guild that I was going to bed and told them goodnight. I went to sleep.\n\nApparently my joke really triggered Susan, so she started spamming Micheal mean DMs and whispers in-game while he was leveling fishing. She then rage quit the guild for a second time, and sent an extremely inappropriate message in the guild's Discord server, saying that Micheal had abandoned her to RP with me and that was why she was leaving. I wish I would've been able to screenshot the message but unfortunately Micheal had since deleted it and I was asleep when all of this went down. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning Micheal told me everything that had happened. I have tried to be supportive since then, because I know how much it sucks when you're dealing with a toxic person who you thought was your friend. I also came to find out that Susan did some other fucked up shit other than just be jealous at me. She would be abrasive and passive aggressive at him whenever he would simply hang out with his friends in the guild, or do things that didn't involve her. He also admitted that he was probably too soft on her and was tolerant of her behavior because she was going through some rough times irl. \n\nI told him that going through a tough time irl doesn't excuse her for being an asshole. I also told him that I don't want her to have a third chance in the guild, as she makes me uncomfortable. I definitely don't want to have anything to do with her at this point. She sounds like a toxic and mean spirited bitch. I really hope that Micheal has learned from this and will get a thicker skin, because if he does forgive her and let her back into the guild, I will leave. \n\nAnyways that's my update! Hopefully this will be my last update and that the situation has been resolved for good! Thanks for all your advice and support. &lt;3",

Take note of this,  it's from an popular fandom  where you will see introductions of ocs regularly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there's canons, which are needed to drive the plot on course  Recently it feels like ocs are taking over the role-play with relationships, drama, and OCC. Right now there's a few canons  who are following the main story, but the people who play canons also have ocs as well;  their interactions are a priority instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not a criminal thing to do nonetheless. I prefer interactions over a dead chat any day. It feels like this is a role-play an adoption center of ocs like canons are tucked in the closet. It's harder for me to slot an interaction too because I play two canon side characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have an oc, be my guest and role-play with whoever you desire \ud83d\udc4d . It's exhausting to wait for an opportunity to role-play when half the server is in OC fever",

Am I the asshole? Or am I just explaining myself wrong?\n\nHow do I fix this? Because I know she's angry, or perhaps just affected, idk, we've been friends for years and I feel real bad for this whole thing, please give me some advice",

There just doesn't feel like there's that many options for me, and I'm really not a fan of Google Docs or Discord.\n\nI was thinking of going to Tumblr, but Tumblr confuses me and for some reason I just feel really overwhelmed and hesitant to reach out to anybody on there.

No absolute Kinesis powers, no Immunity.\n* The game takes place in the 1950s.\n* Supernatural species are at war with Humans and their King. \n\nThe only thing that hardly works smoothly is the staff members, it's falling apart, and still, they pretend to don't notice this. A guy just rage quit two weeks ago. Out of nine staff members, there are two where you take a breath, say a prayer for patience when voicing your opinion.\n\nAzrael comes off as a rude guy, seems to take action only when it benefits him or when somebody fills his DMs demanding action, and when his 2nd-in-command quits the Staff group. At times he's very toxic and hardly keeps his word, has a habit of showing off when it is about his character, events where he's the narrator, believes almost blindly that he's untouchable. He got caught red-handed twice, cheating.\n\nIvelisse constantly flames other players and makes fun of them with her friends, plots to kill somebody's character for OOC reasons, doesn't take No for an answer and doesn't take lightly being proven that she's wrong. At times gives off an impression that she runs the group, frequently leaves the staff group, can't have a one-on-one talk with somebody, her friends speak for her, and another staff member (his OC and his NPC dates her OCs, there's a rumor of them dating IRL) step in to defend her. There's a story of her first days where she chased after the bigger fish to benefit her OCs (enhanced equipment, leveling up with souls -somebody else gets the kill-). Azrael's 2nd-in-command.\n\nI'm also a Staff member (my OC is my friend's 2nd-in-command), still getting the hang of things, reach out to other staff members the trio I know that will explain it to me nicely, won't act as I've just struck a nerve for making a question or wanting to understand certain circumstances. There are times where I take a deep breath and remind myself why I'm here and for what, even if things are complicated. After an unnecessary argument involving staff members last Friday involving a member who just came back and Ivelisse's OC, I don't feel like saying a word there. Only when needed: Checking messages when mentioned, updating the member's list, and approving OC sheets. \n\nAs for my OC, I have plans for her: As the Regent, it involves leveling up, training other members, crafting weapons (using our species resources), preparing for upcoming wars.   \nWith this, I have reasons to stay. Maybe if I follow this path, things won't be too stressful, and I won't end up overwhelmed, considering renouncing and leaving for good.",

            "selftext": "So I play World of Warcraft classic on a RP server. I joined my guild shortly after just making my character, because I saw their guild advertisement in LFG chat and thought it was funny. \n\nThe guild is a roleplay guild so I started writing with them in-game and on Discord. I vibed really well with the guildmaster, who I'll just call Micheal. Micheal and I roleplayed for a little bit on our characters, and ultimately decided that we wanted to ship them. All was pretty good and well. \n\nExcept that Micheal had another roleplay partner with another character, who I'll just call Susan. Normally I would've been okay with this because I have multiple roleplay partners on Discord each with unique stories and characters. But Susan made things extremely uncomfortable when she rage quit the guild, after telling Micheal that she was jealous of me. I was hoping this was the end of it, but she ultimately rejoined the group. \n\nI had my suspicions that she was jealous because Susan didn't exactly treat me all that well either, and was passive aggressive whenever we talked. I had many awkward moments with her just playing the game, and even at roleplay events. According to Micheal, him and Susan have had multiple arguments about her jealousy, and fairly recently he dropped her as a roleplay partner. \n\nMicheal is getting ready to promote me to be the roleplay officer of the guild where I'll be hosting roleplay events and stories for the guild and I just hope that doesn't cause even more drama with Susan. \n\nSo in conclusion.. this roleplayer wanted her roleplay partner to only RP with her and not have other roleplay partners. Which is extremely unrealistic lol at least in my opinion. I'm still going through this, if it gets really bad, I might just leave the guild and go elsewhere, because this is a bit ridiculous.",

I feel like maybe this situation is due to my error. \n\nMy first introduction was long, like at least 11 paragraphs. Their reply was not good, wrong point of view and very choppy, with not a lot to work with and probably 3 paragraphs if you combine it all. I figured first post jitters and offer a few corrections but was sure to be nice and positive about it, I didn't want to make them feel bad or discouraged. They are interested and edited it after some prodding. \n\nBut then I replied, my post was 4 paragraphs this time, I tried to keep things concise, well for me anyway. And they sent a single paragraph in just 10 mins. This guy seems nice but I'm not sure the size difference in posts is working for me. I'm busy and don't do short fast replies. I like longer posts. I am happy to wait a few days or weeks, I don't want him feeling rushed. \n\nI've had partners gradually match me and even push me to match them. But I worry this partner might feel I'm nitpicking too much if I ask them to write more. How can I ask about them writing more without feeling llke a nag? Or should I give it a few more posts and see if he follows my lead? I feel responsible for this issue but I don't want him to get discouraged either. I'm happy to work with them but I don't want them to feel obligated to change their comfort zone either.\n\nI suppose I should just say something?",

Me and that partner ended things amicably as they said they were comfortable with posting what they had and I expressed how I was looking for more. I thanked him for his cooperation up until then and he was understanding that we weren't a good fit. We both wished each other well and I said if in the future he ever feels like reaching out, he is welcome to do so. He seemed like a good person and maybe in the future we can work on something together. \n\nI'm glad he was upfront about his comfort zone as I'd never want to hold people to a standard they're not aware of or comfortable with meeting. I need to be more direct in the future and less lax in my ads, as I've become. But I think this was a learning experience for both of us and I'm glad it didn't lead to some kind of squabble where my partner felt attacked, as that was the last thing I wanted to have happen. You guys were generally right in that it wasn't a good fit, I just wanted the fandom badly that I was about to embark on a writing project that I'd probably grow to resent so thanks for keeping me from forcing something I shouldn't. :)",

But once I'd send over my discord and start talking about what directions the RP would go and such, I'd notice how I wasn't really feeling up to playing against my partner's character. They often felt really flat and uninspired, or other times they really deviated away from canon for their backstory and origin, which made it hard to get invested in them. Sometimes I gave it a shot, but other times I'd have to tell my partner I wasn't really feeling it without telling them why (no real reason to trash or critique a character someone likely put a lot of time and effort into and end up making them feel bad). \n\nI'm not sure if that was just a me thing, or if that's something people encounter a lot. If I'm being honest, it's made me feel like the reason doubling is so common is just so people can get their preferred canon for their OC, and have to give up something in exchange (their time and energy playing someone's preferred canon) to get it. \n\nI'd like to try playing a Canon against an OC, but I don't know how to necessarily go about it being \"judgey\" about the quality of what kind of character I'm playing against, especially if choosing a popular canon floods me with messages from other people. \n\nI hope that didn't come off as too condescending or gatekeep-y or anything.",

Basically if someone didn't like you they could report you for the most trivial thing and if they knew the mods you would flagged. \nYou would get harassed on there and even be blocked by people who assumed they knew you because others said so.\n\nI didn't have all of this happen to me but some yes. Others I knew also had similar issues as well.\n\nFuthermore; I switched to reddit about a year ago. \n\nOf course subreddits for roleplay was one of the FIRST things I looked for. I was honestly surprised there was so much activity in multiple ones and am still pleased.\n\nHowever I am fed up with people making most that say: \"Looking for long term partner, need some one who can communicate and is committed\"\n\nWhy??? Because those are the people who tell you there sad, sad tales of being ghosted or blocked; you fall for it and you find out why soon after they have no luck finding good rp partners.\n\nA- They dissappear for days at a time with out warning, making it almost impossible to even get started or get through the 1st scene.\n\nB- They have poor grammer I mean AWFUL and it isn't bad English they just don't spell check and type 1-2 liners in like 30 seconds flat.\n\nC- They don't read your full response and usually mess up the scene.\n\nD- Their role play style is sadly lacking and dry with no flow or real emotion.\n\n\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\nThe harsh truth is: \n\n**They can't find a good rp partner, because they are the bad rp partner.**\n\nI try really hard to talk with people and be honest. It's why I have 3 good partners rn; but when I have messaged you:\n\n**Me: \"Hey you've been gone 2 days with no warning could you please try and just let me know when you are gonna dissappear?\"\n\nThem: \"Sure, I'm sorry life's been in the way.\"\n\nMe:\" It's okay I work part time, and stuff so I get it! :)\"\n\nThem:\" Okay cool I'll be back later.\"**\n\n\nAnd you don't come back for over 24 hours and don't send but 1 part and do it again; **YOUR ASS IS GETTING BLOCKED**\n\n\n-Sorry for this long ass post I needed to vent I hate loosing partners I like even if they have bad habits such as the ones I've listed; I'm not nit picky but I can't rp with someone who sends 1 message every 4 days when they agreed to be consistent I the 1st place.",

I just up and left, apparently, and I\u2019m the last one to know. And yet, I haven\u2019t, or, I don\u2019t think I have. \n\nEvery single last one of my rp partners have suddenly and without a single explanation, stopped talking to me or just disappeared.

I sound like I\u2019m going crazy. Maybe I am. Did I just blip out of existence?\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019ve messaged maybe three, four people about role play possibilities on some subreddits, and not a single person has even acknowledged me. It\u2019s so strange. This has never happened before.\n\nI just feel so alone and like I\u2019ve been forgotten and abandoned. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a room of people and I\u2019m screaming and no one can hear me or see me or knows my name. Like I have no mouth and I must, must scream.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m mad. Do I need help?\n\nI\u2019m not an attention needing person. I\u2019m really not. I\u2019ve had ghostings and the like, certainly my fair share of them. But this event has me jostled like nothing else. I feel like time has just stopped and no one beyond who I can see in real life is even there. Like things have stopped happening and I feel so\u2026 disconnected. It stings and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSorry to anyone who reads this.

            "selftext": "This post will serve as the beginning of a long series of complaints I have about roleplayers that I\u2019ve encountered over the span of 10+ years. I\u2019ll be releasing these as I think of them, so sorry if I double post a few times. If you have an opposing opinion to mine, that\u2019s great! Please don\u2019t just downvote because of this, as I feel that I\u2019m going to address a lot of issues about this community, and I\u2019d really rather they not get lost. Just shoot me a comment, and we can discuss it there. I plan on answering most, if not all, of the comments that I get on these.\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, and you\u2019ve already read the title, let me explain. I\u2019ve had to have this talk with many RP partners in the past, so I feel like I can articulate this point fairly well now. The term \u201coverpowered\u201d (OP) implies that there\u2019s a base standard of power in the universe you want to RP in. It also implies that there\u2019s a ceiling that the most powerful characters meet. When you call a character \u201cOP\u201d, you\u2019re implying that the character shatters that ceiling, surpassing even the most powerful characters in that universe. If that\u2019s not what you\u2019re implying, the word you\u2019re meaning to use is just \u201cpowerful\u201d lol.Let me give you an example.I have a superhero OC whose powers revolve around his mind, body, and spirit. He was granted abilities that enhance all of these aspects of himself, so he can read **minds**, has an enhanced **body** that he can manipulate freely, and can project **spiritual** energy. This gives him a lot of powers, sure, but the theme is there. If you know anything about superheroes, this kind of character really shouldn\u2019t be that shocking to you. The absolutely insane things that a majority of these characters can pull off makes my character seem powerless in comparison. You would only have a problem with my character if you planned on making your character severely weaker and expected me to do the same. Here\u2019s why I won\u2019t.\n\n1. If we\u2019re playing against each other, I cannot kill your character. End of story. Period. Once I do that, the story\u2019s over, so what\u2019s the point of me doing that? Plus, I have a rule that prevents me from landing attacks on my partner\u2019s character, even if I\u2019m just playing as a side villain along with my main character. No touchy. Ever. I always have to wait for my partner\u2019s permission to land anything. Nerfing my character wouldn\u2019t really give you an advantage in any way.\n2. If our characters are on the same side, the story doesn\u2019t just become more interesting because our characters are weak. Let me tell you why that\u2019s such a weird rationale to me, even though it seems to be a very popular mindset. I get that everyone wants to see character progression in a story. Trust me, I do too. But why does that progression always have to come in the form of the overused \u201czero to hero\u201d trope? Why can\u2019t we be protagonists who lose everything and have to learn how to cope? Or all-powerful beings who learn that there\u2019s more to life than power? *That\u2019s* character progression. And if you feel like you\u2019re \u201ctoo strong\u201d, whatever that means, you realize that it\u2019s your story, right? So... you make the villain? Just make the villain stronger, dummy. Duh.\n3. You can scroll through this subreddit for 30 seconds and see hundreds upon hundreds of complaints about ghosting. Not only that, but you\u2019ll find just as many posts about stories becoming bland after a few posts. I\u2019m here to tell you that one really easy way to spice up an action RP, at least, is to make your characters stronger. Explosions. Being knocked through buildings. The kind of stuff that we love to consume in action media. Yeah, you should try writing it. But that\u2019s really hard to do when you want to make your character a squishmallow for the sake of \u201cpRoGrEsSiOn.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you guys, but the best RPs only last a couple years at max, and those are super, *super* rare to come by. It\u2019s more common for you to get a plot going, RP for about a week or two, then stop. I don\u2019t know when you think that \u201cprogression\u201d is going to happen, but you should just do yourself a favor and play as your character at their most powerful.\n\nTLDR: Most of the stuff you guys call \u201cOP\u201d isn\u2019t actually OP. If the powers aren\u2019t just a random list of abilities and they\u2019re used correctly, you probably only have an issue with it because you want to rely on the \u201czero to hero\u201d trope for your character. That\u2019s the fault of your lazy writing, not your partner\u2019s. You\u2019re not going to become \u201ctoo powerful\u201d because you give yourself strong abilities. Buffing the villain is always an option.",

Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t mourn the loss of the current Rps though, right?\n\nSigh.\n\nI\u2019d consider trying some new partners, but the whole process is akin to dating and the constant ghosting and ditching is too tiring.\n\nUgh.\n\nVent over.",
