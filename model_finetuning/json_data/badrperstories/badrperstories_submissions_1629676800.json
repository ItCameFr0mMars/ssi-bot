Their answer: Back when the campaign started (a few months ago) and lately, too.   \nIvelisse accused Azrael of siding with his friend (D. Scarlet) when she's also defending the one breaking rules (Hazai).  I pointed out that meta is against the rules and asked for a check-up to make sure penalties are applicable.  \nAlso, concerning Hazai's behavior, it seems he does whatever he wants because nobody took action. Ashmedai and Celia agreed with me.\n\nIvelisse switched focus to me, asking if I waited for D.Scarlet's complaint to bring the subject.  \nI politely answered her: There were previous occurrences. Who were the staff members at the beginning of the campaign?\n\nThen, she went back to arguing with Azrael in the way she usually does. Azrael asked her to mind her tone because she wouldn't like it if he treated her the same way, including asking for her BF to intervene, and she'd walk away from the situation as the one who has been offended.  \nBefore leaving (staff chat), she asked him to look for a new 2nd-in-command.\n\nTo finish the subject now, folks.   \nIf there are rules, they apply to the game in general.    \nIf a player has been visibly wrong various times, defending won't help when it is a discussion to prove a point and apply a penalty. Treating others with arrogance, in the end, is a display of lack of maturity.",

            "selftext": "I want to start out, this person is an AMAZING roleplayer. Like they genuinely write well and have the potential to write amazing and lengthy replies, they're really good and one of the best roleplayers I've been with. But sadly things have turned sour and I'm worried we may never ever continue this rp.\n\nWe start a league of legends roleplay, and honestly I adore the way they played the characters I wanted. They didn't want a double up, just them being the character's I asked for and being overall a really awesome roleplayer, writing lengthy replies, even if they took a few days. I waited patiently and responded back with as much lines. I felt spoilt since they seemed really too good to be true. \n\nHowever, things went downhill, they weren't on as much and then I questioned if there was anything wrong. They said they had gotten a new job, which I congratulated them for and understood they would be busy from now on. However, we still talk, and they seemed to nudge me to show my face (Wasn't comfortable with that and not ready for that kind of relationship) and wanting to ask if they could kiss me and cuddle me. I honestly was confused, they were at work yes, but when they had time off (I saw them playing different games) but then I left it be, understanding they needed time to themselves. I've had roleplayers who can respond at their workplace and have freetime, and this person seems to have quite a bit of freetime. \n\nBut then months past, and the roleplay's been going no where. I felt bad, but kept asking like, every 4 days or so if they were still up for the rp. And they'd say they were and really wanted to continue it and I kept forgiving them, admitting they had a new job and would be very busy and they'd tell me they'd respond now or in a moment. But then even more months passed and still no reply, yet still talking to me as if they weren't busy at all. I'm getting confused and frustrated at this point, as I've been blaming myself for being a spammer, but then I've waited nearly half a year and still the rp's been left cold. They even told me that I could leave the rp because they admit they haven't responded and feel awful for it, but I told them not to blame themselves and would be willing to wait longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really care a lot about this person and I'm admitting I probably am at fault here for worrying so much, I'm happy for them that they got a new job and they're doing well where they are. But I don't know if they even want to continue the rp, since they seem so \"Busy\"  yet they're asking me if they want to kiss, cuddle and be affectionate around me when I told them I'm not ready for that kind of relationship. I don't know anymore, I really want to wait longer for this rp, but then i feel as if I'm in a rut and the rp will never ever continue at this point. \n\nShould I stay longer with the rp and admit I'm being a worry addict?",

This time around we really hit it off in the plotting stages, throwing ideas back and forth, but before we even got passed the plotting stages (last time it was past a few in-character post) they suddenly make up some excuse and leave without a second word. Double whammy when it\u2019s clearly a fake excuse and they block you. \n\nWhat **really** sucks is that both times, these were absolutely dream plots I didn\u2019t think anyone would be interested in picking up.

            "selftext": "So basically, I was looking for an erotica RP centered around AOT, basically it takes place in an alternate universe where only females became Titans and such (if you find it weird keep it to yourself please, I\u2019m not here to receive comments insulting me for what I like)\n\nAnyway, some guy randomly comes, he comments \u201cwould it not be better if the Titans were all male and had huge cocks and fucked the AOT girls?\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m a female irl, and I\u2019m not into maledom, like at all, so I politely declined\n\nHe dmed me and pasted the same exact question, I said \u201cnope sorry\u201d\n\nAnd he starts asking \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\nBecause it\u2019s not the damn plot I originally posted?\n\nI get that when posting a smutty RP plot you\u2019ll likely get responses from weirdos, but I never thought some asshole would just respond demanding to change the whole plot to suit his needs. You wanna fuck girls with giant 50 inch cocks? Then make your own damn post instead of intruding on mine\n\nWhen I post a plot, I\u2019m not looking for suggestions, I know what I want, and when someone comes in and says \u201cIs it not better\u201d or \u201cwhy not do this instead\u201d it annoys me\n\nOf course, if their suggestion doesn\u2019t change the whole plot, I\u2019d be happy to include it, but when they\u2019re asking to change my entire plot just so they can live out their fantasy of having a huge cock, it pisses me off because why can\u2019t they make their own post instead of talking down on mine and claiming theirs is better?",

            "selftext": "First time doing one of these so please bare with me. This is someone I've been friends with for half a decade, so I've known them pretty well. I spent almost everyday with her and played and watched different video games and anime together. This instance is just the one of many that I felt like after a year of no longer being in contact, I feel like I want to share some stories that I can get off my chest.\n\nThis person was someone who was, at the time, someone who shared OC x Cc shipping in common. We loved to talk about the lore, philosophical meanings, headcanons, etc. Though the one thing that she always brought up was this race she created, that she always *\"wants to work on\"* or *\"wants to continue research on\"*. Which at the time I wanted to help her out as much as I could, including making my own characters... until I found myself pouring more lore for her characters than I was for my own.\n\nI was putting in more lore and idea's into her own content and characters than my own, from the language, traditions, religion, culture, the whole ten yards. She loved every idea, every notion and bits of inspiration that fit her plethora of characters, even when I would make a joke it would end up as something 'quirky' for her characters she would make. No matter what little thing I said, she took it and ran with it, when it came to helping her it felt like I was putting more effort than she was, she would mention how I was helping but it didn't feel like I was helping in the way I thought I was. When it came to asking for help for my own characters all I got where \"I don't know\" or \"You do what you want to do\"\n\nIf I \"Wanted to do what I wanna do\" I wouldn't be asking for help! I was starting to feel that \"wall\" build up. Both in the sense of setting my boundaries and being uninspired to make characters for myself. I wasn't drawing characters for fun or myself anymore, I was basically making characters with no passion for the sake of trying to catch up with what new show or game she was into and wanted to RP as soon as possible. I would confide in her the motions I was going through, I sometimes I asked if she could wait or slow down, however she would sound absolutely depressed whenever I said to stop and let me breathe in a sense. There were times I lashed out in anger and frustration whenever she kept asking when we were gonna do something after I told her I need some time or flat out no, other times I attempted to no want to be in any part of it anymore. She would freak out at first but then say \"The door is always open if you want to come back\" probably knowing that I would feel bad, apologize my behavior and continue what I've been doing for her.\n\nIt would later get to points that she would want to do some questionable role playing scenarios, or make make some concerning characters that made me slightly uncomfortable since I would be the person on the receiving end and I tend to get immersive when it comes to roleplaying.  And when I mean questionable I really do mean questionable, from the shipping dynamics, to the off putting details of her childlike characters for some reason always 'wiggled their toes', god just typing that made me feel gross...  \n\n\nIf you want to know anymore in more detail, feel free to message me. I have plenty of stories, 5 years worth actually",

            "selftext": "I use to simp for this roleplayer I met on kik through hilariously a match maker app(?). \n\nWell far along into our .. relationship/friendship(?) I guess we had talked a bit about preferences for roleplay and I dont know how but the subject of ERP came up. They had mentioned that they would do ERP but stayed loyal to there girlfriend (plot twist; they were not) so they only ERPed with them. \n\nNow I say that this person thinks very highly of themselves in roleplay, as in you can be literally an author of a book that sold a ton of copies, but in his eyes your accomplishments don't topple his that is his own characters and the fact that he finished an RP. Hell they would even mention how much of a good person they are unprovoked because so and so doesn't want to talk to them because of something that happened in an rp. \n\nSo they kept rambling on about how unloyal some people are to there rp partners or lovers and just **how loyal** he was to his girlfriend and I decided to finally put in my two cents.\n\n\"Yeah, I kinda ERP with different people but that's because I don't have a roleplay partner \" \n\nThen silence, it's as if the storm that raged outside had suddenly subsided before...\n\n\"...I dunno why but that kinda makes me pretty jealous...??\" \n\nAh yes..the eye of the hurricane right before my eyes literally milliseconds before..\n\n\"...maybe I can be your roleplay partner lol I just don't feel comfortable with you doing ERP with random people \" \n\nDead, this man's loyalty ? Destroyed and torn apart in\n\n**S e c o n d s**\n\nNow at the time being a literal head of ass was like \n\n\"Omg yes I would love that!\" \n\nAnd thinking on it now as a wise head ass who recognizes that I was talking to literal mold on cheese I should of been like.\n\n\"Uhhh what about your girlfriend that you sworn to only uh do the fictional funky wunkies with ? Why did that change in literally 10 messages \" \n\nBut alas I was very stoopid and just..stopped erping with other people because Mr.Loyal told me not to and only do the written art of dirty dancing with him while he was also shaking his poms poms with his girlfriend who was completely unaware of his true feelings or his actions.\n\nOf course though with actions comes consequences, so he did get dumped and so did I as a roleplay partner because I caused him to lose his long term girlfriend. Granted I am partially to blame but he refused to accept any responsibility for it. \n\nAnd I took it very personally because right after that I just stopped roleplaying because I truly did believe I was an awful person for roleplaying sexily with this man who is 100 loyal and I was too afraid to cause another split up because of my actions. \n\nReflecting in it now though I think the only reason why I felt much of anything towards them was because they were heavily passionate about rp much like I was and it's incredibly difficult to find people like that. I was also very desperate for a roleplay partner that I can just actively talk about roleplay ideas with and come up with plots. I mean I still am but not so heavy that I will literally just simp for someone that badly and not call them out on there pile of shoes.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Sorry if this is tje wrong place to post this, but I don't know where else to post. I've got a bit of a conundrum. I've posted my ad twice and only had 3 people interested. One clearly didn't read my post, and the other two ghosted me during planning. I'm wondering if theres something wrong with my post? Did I come off grumpy? Or maybe demanding? Info overload? Any help or tips is appreciated. Here is a copy of my post:\n\n\n\n[F4A] [Email] Veteran RPer looking to get back into roleplay after long hiatus.\n\nHello all! I'm Lily. I'm 27 years old. I'm looking for a 21+ literate partner who doesn't mind me stretching my neglected writing muscles as we play. I've been roleplaying for the better part of a decade, but had to take a break the past few years (3 to be exact) due to mental health issues and life changes.\n\nMy Credentials:\nI had been role-playing semi-literate to literate roleplays for about 8 years before I went on hiatus. I tend to write multiple paragraphs (3+), so I don't like to do one-liners. However, I realize that the flow of the story can change the length of the posts. Quality over quantity and all that. \n\nI prefer to plan out my roleplays, so please be ok with that. I have a bad habit of getting off track, so having guidelines set in place helps me to stay focused and keeps the story rolling. I write in third person only, and it would be nice if you did too.\u00a0 My time zone is PST, but I keep odd hours. \n\n\nPartner Credentials:\nI'll be honest with you; I don't have many requirements. As I've stated, I'm looking for a long-term literate partner. I would prefer it if you would be able to write multiple paragraphs. Please be 21+. I would like someone closer to my age. Please be ok with rping on either email or gdocs That's pretty much it. \n\n\nRoleplay Stats:\nI only play female characters, but can play side characters of (almost) any gender. I only have experience in FxM, but am happy to play FxA if you don't mind my learning curve. I'd like to include a little bit of NSFW, but I'd like it if the story came first, and it happens (relatively) naturally\n\nThe genre I'm looking for is romance, beauty and the beast style. It doesn't have to be traditional beauty and the beast, let me hear your takes on the story! Lets get creative with it! \n\nI also had this cute slice of life idea for an FxF roleplay based around wearing Japanese fashion in western countries.\n\n I also would like to play a size inclusive roleplay. I think a cute chubby girl would be fun to play for a change.\n\n I am open to other plot ideas though, if those don't strike your fancy. Please feel free to suggest your own plots. The only plots I won't play are fandoms. I like to make my characters my own, and I feel like I can't do that in a fandom roleplay. \n\nPlease be willing to play on email. I like it because there's no character limit, and it's easy to see past posts even while writing. I've never played on gdocs, but would be happy to learn if you'd rather to there. I have tried discord, and did not like it. It's fine for chatting, but I always hit the character limit. Please don't ask me to rp on discord. \n\nI tend to put a lot of effort into my posts, and as such they take me longer to write. I can get a little carried away with my writing and sometimes it needs some extra editing to whip it into shape. I'm looking to have a reply pace of 1 post every 2-3 days. That will give me enough time to write, edit and produce a quality post. \n\nPlease be willing to play some side characters. I can do a bunch of them, but it would be nice to share that burden instead of carrying it all. Plus, side characters can give a plot a healthy dose of reality. \n\n\nI'm afraid I don't currently have a writing sample, but if you'd like to see something before commiting I'd be happy to whip something up. Just shoot me a message, and we can chat about it. \n\nWell, I think that's about it. I tried to keep it short and to the point so I don't waste anybody's time. Sorry if I come off grouchy, that was an unintended side effect. I'm really friendly when I'm not trying to trim the fat lol. If I missed anything, or you have some questions for me, please feel free to ask! I'd be happy to answer! I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks for reading and have a lovely day!",

Their answer: Back when the campaign started (a few months ago) and lately, too.  \nIvelisse accused Azrael of siding with his friend (D. Scarlet) when she's also defending the one breaking rules (Hazai).    \nI pointed out that meta is against the rules and asked for a check-up to make sure penalties are applicable.Also, concerning Hazai's behavior, it seems he does whatever he wants because nobody took action. Ashmedai and Celia agreed with me.\n\nIvelisse switched focus to me, asking if I waited for D.Scarlet's complaint to bring the subject.I politely answered her: There were previous occurrences. Who were the staff members at the beginning of the campaign?\n\nThen, she went back to arguing with Azrael in the way she usually does. Azrael asked her to mind her tone because she wouldn't like it if he treated her the same way, including asking for her BF to intervene, and she'd walk away from the situation as the one who has been offended.Before leaving (staff chat), she asked him to look for a new 2nd-in-command.\n\nTo finish the subject now, folks.  \nIf there are rules, they apply to the game in general.  \nIf a player has been visibly wrong various times, defending won't help when it is a discussion to prove a point and apply a penalty.   \nTreating others with arrogance, in the end, is a display of lack of maturity.",

I know that they had some things happening in their personal life, but that has since passed.

            "selftext": "Im on a rp server where I constantly feel like a sidekick instead of an actual part of this 3 person (but like 50 individual characters, not all are played at once though). It is very centered around 18+ relationships and gods. Both of which I dont like, but I have nowhere to go. \n\nLast night we had an rp where my character and one other character were in a tense situation because the character played by the other player almost killed hers and his dad. His rp has consisted mostly of crying and threatening to kill himself because my character won't just forgive him and ignore what [happened. ](https://happened.My)[My](https://happened.My) character is devastated and feels betrayed, she has tried to say so, but its all about the other character. So 3 hrs of just back and forth of how my character is a horrible person, but no one taking a second to find out what she needs, its all about the one character. This is very normal for this server, the one that created it has their characters as the integral part of the rp, which is why I tend to feel like a sidekick.\n\nI've had times where the other two players tell me my rp is boring because i don't erp, and how they have to play the rp I want even if it's dull to them. I've had to change characters to fit their stories to even have a chance to play their way, then whenever there is actual conflict I'm just in a pissed mood, not that I'm trying to play my character. Like last night, one player said my character was just being (cuss word). This rp is not satisfying most of the time, I've had great rp before, where everyone made a difference, where everyone was included and their opinions IC mattered, it wasn't just a one-person show. I don't care about being a star at every moment, I just want my additions to matter not 'your character is upset, but my character is even more so. Your character has to ignore their feelings and cater to mine'. 'oh you have a sad story to tell, well mine is worse so ill tell you.'\n\nThe third rper is my irl fiance, and he just gets angry because he has a certain rp he wants and anything different he says the rp sucks, then he gripes at me like it's my fault and I'm tearing the server down with my negativity. I just want to matter!!! Is that so bad!!!!???? Irl I'm a pretty invisible person, that people normally just kind of ignore, and when i get this rp, its a mirror of rl.\n\nI'd love to find other rp, but I've searched before and even after saying I dont do the erp stuff, its insisted I do, so I just give up.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions? I don't know what to do, I want to rp, but I want to mean something to the story.",

It's been some time since it happened and I thought it would just be the end of it.\n\nBut just now, they messaged me. They explained things, apologised and asked for another chance. I had been wondering whether they would even come back and made up my mind on what to do if they came back. Because after all, when push comes to shove, things are easier said than done in most cases.\n\nHowever, when getting these messages, the choice really was as clear as day and... I rejected the offer, I did it! I told him my choice and wished him well and well, I guess that's it. Honestly, this shit feels good. \ud83e\udd29\n\nThanks again for reading and to the people who reached out on the other post, you truly have been a big help!",

This language was done in VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) style, had *multiple* special characters including things like using \"K&amp;\" to symbolise a certain accent on the \"k\" sound. Oh, and even though there was a \"Z\" sound used *frequently*,, there was no actual \"Z\" *LETTER*, meaning you had to jerry-rig it with \"S&lt;\". did I mention that the \"Z\" sound was apparently *super* common in this language? \n\nTyping looked like ASCII code. All dialogue had to be done in this conlang, and our characters would learn it \"realistically\". okay, really, it's a neat little thing to flavour your character and your settings... but holy *damn* does it make it *super* tedious to read. The writings were things like \n\n\"K&amp;umj S&lt;any Brettina\" which, translated literally, meant \"Ran south Brettina\" translated literally. \n\nWe pointed out how difficult this was to learn - because again, learning a language can be difficult, and this is also an *extremely* limited skillset - there's a reason nobody speaks Coptic anymore unless you're a member of the Coptic Orthodox church. If this was like, Spanish I could at least use it outside of this. this Conlang does nothing but make us tune out when your character is speaking with what sounds like some kind of code and translated it comes off as super weird. \n\nSimilarly, another person had a conlang that was basically a programming language... Oh dear lord. Was that ever *weird*. \n\n\ntldr: Don't make people RP in Conlangs.",

            "selftext": "Hello! Honestly, I don't even know where to begin. This basically have been a thing since, um, a few months ago. Started subtly, just similar traits of personality and abilities. So, I'm in this rp group (made by friends). One of my first characters was this girl whose personality I based on multiple characters; very bubbly, borderline crazy, seems to live in her own world, talks to animals and always is surrounded by them. She's basically a sunshine. Having that in mind, everything begun from there. \n\nThis roleplayer made a new character months later with basically the same personality traits my character had. It was almost a carbon copy of mine. Animal talking and all. In the moment, I didn't give her a lot of importance and continued my life as normal, didn't irritate me much. I mean, was the first time and thought it was solely a mere coincidence that our characters were VERY similar. \n\nSecond time that happened, this time was another character of mine. Same, bubbly but unlike the other one, this one was more innocent and clueless. Literally had no clue over the human world and how it functions. I made him fan of anime and comics. Nerdy but adorable. I think after two months, this person created a character with same personality traits as this character of mine but, it was more obvious than before. This person also added anime and comics as her character's likings - and I was like, okay, maybe I'm just overthinking it. A lot of people can have their characters similar. You know? Is not as though is something SUPER unique and could be also taken as basic. Is nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, here comes the cherry on top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy very first character, my baby, through months I've been fleshing out his background story. I wanted him to be deeper and have a twisted past, for which I made him have a lot of physical scars and burn marks. Long story short, his family used to torture him when younger. So, eventually there was this scene with another roleplayer in there who has his love interest where my character finally opened up and showed him his scars and all. It was very emotional and deep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, guess who made her character also have tons of scars made by their family and almost said the very same lines/quotes my character said to his love interest? That's right, this roleplayer did. I tried not to make a drama out of it but to be honest, I couldn't help to feel like something was off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overthinking it too much or my hunch is right and it's indeed a copying pattern?",

            "selftext": "So I've been modding in a more laid-back and individually plot driven fantasy server and it's honestly been great. (It takes a lot for me to sit down in a server let alone work to mod hood so it's definitely a score of an rp for me.) Though we've been getting a lot of players as of late using it to inject their DnD characters. Which is fine because it's a fantasy server, granted without die or DnDs lore, but we're a bit open about races you can play or power inspirations. All and dandy right? Well no as this is Badrperstories. There's a big problem ... these players just can't seem to compromise. \n\nWe don't use dice? Well here they come mentioning d10s and all these heavy DnD terms that have no place in our server and then they get huffy when we explain we don't use DnD stuff here/when we ask them to explain what stuff we MAY allow means. (Which is usually met with look it up.) We are a more low powered setting? Well here is my maxed out DnD PC with a multitude of spells that will invalidate every other magic oriented character or martial abilities the greatest knight could only dream of attaining. They too will get huffy about that if asked to tone it down or God forbid they just make a new character. Like did you not read any of our rules and wants? If none of our characters can get through a simple goblin fight without a scratch or two then what makes you think your Beholder Slayer will get approved? It's honestly been a frustrating experience because we don't want to start banning DnD stuff outright, but we're at our wit's end.",

We\u2019ve been rping quite a while now, the setting being a Zelda like fantasy world where our characters are both childhood friends trying to become adventurous heroes. As the roleplay goes on, my character has romantic tension with Tom\u2019s as they always have their sarcastic and flirtatious banter . But ig this probably made Ana feel left out so I did try to balance  my characters flirting and also giving her character much interactions/attention as I can. But no she seemed to be quite jealous of our relationship and starts to have her character flirt with Tom\u2019s which later on made their characters a couple(which made me feel really sadden honestly). \nAs the story progresses, they\u2019ve been ignoring my character a lot whenever an important part of the rp comes up and would leave me on open as they would favor going into their dms for sexy times for hours. Not to mention, Ana always hogs up the spotlight and always talk/think about Tom\u2019s character whenever he\u2019s AFK. \n\nAfter a long while of thinking, I finally told them that I felt left out of the rp and that I didn\u2019t fit in. Tom made a weird suggestion that I can also b in a poly relationship with them too but I awkwardly declined for numerous of reasons(me and anas character had no tension being one). So Ana made the \u2018bright idea\u2019 to make a character for me to romance. But she hardly even gives this character any personality and depth so it feels like I\u2019m talking to a robot who agrees with everything I say or do compared to her detailed responses she would give to Tom. At this rate I feel like giving up as I am feeling left out. But at the same time I enjoy our storytelling and the world building so far.",

I went along with their ideas and they still left.\n\nI know it\u2019s probably stupid to get emotional over basically writing a fanfic with someone else who left. But roleplaying is my way of just forgetting about everything else and write, which is something I love. So what else can I do? Because I feel like I\u2019ve tried it all.",

These issues seem to come out whenever he feels as though he's going to be judged for something. Such as he'll be open about listening to rock/metal, but it took him a long time to admit he also enjoyed pop music because he was worried I'd think he was weird for it. I didn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn RP terms this issue comes up with stuff like he doesn't enjoy playing \"Manly\" characters, but feels like he has to. When it comes to adult themes he's mentioned that he does want to do them, but his self-esteem issues cause him to criticize himself so harshly. This stems from a belief he has that as a guy if he likes stuff like that it's wrong because he's been taught/led to believe that guys only like stuff like that if they're gross, perverts. His words not mine. I have no idea who put that in his head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's a great friend, but his issues do make RP's kind of difficult because of how easily he gets hung up on things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdvice?",

            "selftext": "Ohhh boy where do I even begin with this story? This all happened a few years ago so some details may be fuzzy so bear with me.\n\nThis incident occurred in a simple superpower/fantasy magic school rp. There weren't any set rules or limitations to what your oc's powers can be but staff have to review your oc before it's approved to make sure it isn't anything broken or unhealthy. I decided to see if anybody was up to fight with my witch oc, Liliana. Shortly after making the post I got a response from a new person, we'll call him Henry. Before rping, I decided to check his oc, Gilgamesh (at least that's what I think his name was) out. Telekinesis and Super Strength were his 2 main powers, so I figured it'd be a pretty fair fight when compared to Liliana (spoiler alert: this did not end up being the case.) So we pick a location and start. Gilgamesh is causing a ruckus in the school's courtyard so I have Liliana show up on the scene to put a stop to the situation. After making my post, I decide to step away from Discord for a bit to get some dinner, and respond once I've eaten. So fast forward a few minutes and I come back to see how Gilgamesh has responded. And this was the exact moment things went straight to hell.\n\nRemember how I said Gilgamesh had Telekinesis? Most would assume that he would, y'know, use it to send things flying at you, normal stuff like that. But for Henry, his idea of Telekinesis was using said power on Liliana's nervous system to paralyze her from the neck down on an autohit. This alone was enough to make me feel sick, but it only got worse from there. Because once Liliana couldn't fight back, Gilgamesh walked over to her, and non-con'd her in a very graphic and disgusting paragraph that I wouldn't even subject my worst enemy too.\n\nNaturally, my first response was to report the situation to staff, while questioning wtf I had just read. While erp was allowed on the server, it was only allowed in designated erp locations, and both parties had to agree to it. The school courtyard was not a designated erp location, and I did not agree to this. Staff were quick to go after Henry, absolutely flaming him for the post he'd made, and when they questioned why, he tried to blow it off as just (something that Gilgamesh would naturally do). Next came the question of why he'd godmodded with telekinesis, and his response? He pulled up a page from the superpower wiki, and told US to do our research, before claiming most people here sucked at rping because they couldn't understand his oc. When we pointed out that the superpower wiki was not an established source of powers for the server, and he couldn't just use that and it being natural for his oc to R*** people as excuses, Henry continued to insult us and the server. Eventually, staff had enough of this, and Henry earned the new record for most stupid reason to get banned from a server, with the rp being promptly voided. I've been rping for almost 9 years now, and this still stands as the worst rp experience I've ever had.",

            "selftext": "So, there's this thing about rp groups really that's been tugging on my hair for quite some time now. I've been rp-ing for a little under a decade now, when I first started out, I saw an abundance of FC's and basically, people not really caring where that FC came from. Heck, you can get a random picture from the internet and people would be cool with that since it's only for reference.\n\nWhat I've noticed recently though, is that a lot of people have put ***too much importance*** on face claims and it's a bit weird? Like nowadays, if you want to join an rp group, the faceclaim has to be an actor only (and if they're not well-known a.k.a. an American/European actor) they're not allowed.\n\nI wonder what everyone's opinion about this is? I'm also a bit peeved that nowadays you *need* to have resources of your faceclaim or else they won't allow you to join the rp group. I've since then just been searching for other places to roleplay that aren't too strict when it comes to it.\n\nBut what about your opinions guys? Anybody else notice this weird sudden importance when it comes to faceclaims?",

Then make your own damn post instead of intruding on mine\n\nWhen I post a plot, I\u2019m not looking for suggestions, I know what I want, and when someone comes in and says \u201cIs it not better\u201d or \u201cwhy not do this instead\u201d it annoys me\n\nOf course, if their suggestion doesn\u2019t change the whole plot, I\u2019d be happy to include it, but when they\u2019re asking to change my entire plot just so they can live out their fantasy of having a huge cock, it pisses me off because why can\u2019t they make their own post instead of talking down on mine and claiming theirs is better?",
