            "selftext": "Rea: Rp Buddies Character \nAnn: Mine\n\nMost rps were always seeming to go good until my rp buddy would unexpectedly cause some rivaley between our characters, here are some examples: \n\nRea is friends with Ann until Rea gets randomly bitchy to some innocent girls because they failed an audition that Rea was hosting, when Ann tells her that having mommy issues isn't excuse to bully people as this behavior had gone on for quite some time Rea instantly spreads rumors about Ann &amp; ruins her reputation because she felt entitled to being well....entitled, when I spoke to my rp buddy about this they ended the rp with Rea going clinically insane &amp; refused to give her any character growth. This has happened in multiple rps. \n\nRea is ultimately a rich singer with an attitude &amp; has bullied people in school, but after the characters learn her backstory it instantly earns their sympathy without any attempt at actually earning forgiveness. Ann isn't rich like Rea but is in a really good homelife, the rest of the characters see her as privileged &amp; vilify her constantly for being upper middle class often thinking of her as a shallow spoiled mean girl, despite Rea being exactly that she is in favor always. \n\nRea is treated special by the plot, often surronding mistreating Ann. Rea ruins Ann's chances with a guy by humilating her with false claims that she was a whore who used another guy, Hayden (another character in our rp) with no proof whatsoever. The guy in turn embarsses Ann publically in multiple turns as well, like throwing her out his car because he didn't like the way she asked him out, accusing her of abuse, &amp; screaming at her in a hallway. \n\n\nThat is just half of what my ex rp buddy has done, they'd treat their character special until I call them out, then they'd make something bad happen to Rea to earn pity points while claiming it was my fault &amp; that Rea truly didn't do anything wrong. Just that I was overreacting. All. The. Time. We had to change rps all the time because of the entitlement my rp buddy had. The weird Rea vs Ann thing was so random.",

I'm very in with communication, which is why this situation is so confusing to me. \n\nNow, beginning of August I started a few rps, regularly responding, multiple responses a day, mid August started kicking me in the butt. Mental health was everywhere and motivation started draining, I'm in a toxic environment suddenly. \n\nI let my few partners know that with all this I wasn't going to be responding as much or at all yk. They all say no worries \"take all the time you need\". \n\nNow, I had this one partner who I was doing an enemies to lovers superhero roleplay with and I was in love with my character (so I'm really interested in the rp). I'm the sort of person who likes ooc especially if the rp has gone quiet because it helps me keep muse and I like having a positive relationship with my partners anyway. So, it was sporadic back and forth, I mostly checked in on them so they would know I was still interested. But one day I decided to send them an image of Lopunny and ask them what their thoughts were because why not you know? And I think this is where things went downhill. \n\nBecause I thought with Lopunny would come playful banner of Pokemon but no they had no idea what the character was and didn't really give anything to banter with because they seemed extremely uninterested in knowing and I was like huh, alright, interesting. They didn't respond to my last message. Few days pass, I see they're online, I ask what's up, but nothing. So I'm not worried. \n\nToday is a new month, I wake up with some vigor! And I go to see their server and I see they've left. They've unadded me and disappeared without a word which is unfortunate because I was really interested in where the roleplay would go you know? \n\nIs this because of impatience? \nThe fact it seemed I was online but not responding to the rp?\nWas Lopunny a massive turn off? \nWho knows, but now I know never to ask someone their thoughts on Lopunny. \nAnd you know too! \n\nAlso it was not a flattering picture of Lopunny\nOr a furry rendition\nJust a screenshot straight from the anime. It was a funny picture of its pear body! well, I thought it was funny. It's still funny.",

            "selftext": "So a few months ago i posted that i was looking for people to Roleplay with now that i put my rules boundaries and limitations along with my posts it weeded out a Majority of the bad roleplayers. But one sticks out let's call her Valkyrie, Valkyrie and I hit off really well we talked and it looked as if we where leaning towards a Viking themed Roleplay. Pretty Sweet right?\n\nBut in the middle of the getting to know you phase,our conversation went something like this\n\n Valkyrie: Shit he's home early\nMe: Who, What's going on?\nValkyrie: My Dickhead brother, Thor just bare with me im hiding in the bathroom\nMe: Ok, well i hope everything is ok it's getting late on my end message me when you can \n\nBut the more i thought about it the more concerned i got so the following day i reached out, and this was my Message\n\nMe: Hey, Valkyrie everything ok?  im really concerned \nJason: This is Jason, the dickhead brother and this conversation is over \n\nWell naturally im shook the last thing i want is someone's Dickhead brother or significant other upset and possibly trying to find me and harm me or my family over something as trivial as a Roleplay. But within a few seconds i get a message from Valkyrie here on Reddit\n\nValkyrie: Hey, sorry my brother took my phone, he doesn't know i have a Reddit account on my laptop, i hope he didn't say anything mean to you. \nMe: yeah, he shook me up pretty good all he said was \"This conversation was over\" and i agree with him i don't need someone's Possessive SO or family member trying to do me or my family harm over something so stupid and trivial so good luck to you out there.\n\nThey didn't explain anything, not that they had to, that scared me so much i didn't want to Roleplay with that person anymore obviously. This has happened to me twice now, i kind of think this person made the entire scene up just to waste time but i can't confirm that. To me this is more of a Jealous boyfriend than an over protective big brother. \n\n anyway has this happened to anyone else? If so how did you handle it and what could i do to prevent it in the future?",

Here\u2019s a list of things (in no particular order) that annoy me to absolutely no end when I\u2019m in the midst of attempting to search for an rp partner: \n\n- When people rock up in my dms clearly not having read a word of my ad. The ads I put up are there for a REASON. Please - for the love of god - at least try and read what you\u2019re getting into before reaching it. It just looks really bad and frankly, if you can\u2019t make the effort of reading something that\u2019ll take you a minute to read, I can\u2019t see how you\u2019re going to commit to an rp. Or when people claim to read your ad and then immediately prove otherwise. i.e my ad: I only rp queer relationships, some random guy: hi so we\u2019re rping mxf right? Stop! \n- Self-insert ocs. I think this one is self explanatory.\n- It\u2019s mind-boggling the amount of times I\u2019ve stressed the importance of good grammar in my posts only to get sent messages that read like they were written by a faulty Google Translate bot. \n- This might be controversial but I think it\u2019s important to be friends ooc with someone you rp with. Communication is important, so is setting boundaries so that line between fiction &amp; reality never gets blurred. If you don\u2019t want to share anything about yourself with me, I don\u2019t see it working out long term. There\u2019s a certain trust factor involved, after all. \n- Minors ignoring my age range specifications. I am a 23 year old adult and I want to rp with other adults - and yet I\u2019ll get some in my inbox swearing up &amp; down they\u2019re turning 19 next month. \n- Notice how everything harkens back to people refusing to read roleplay ads?\n- Lastly, why can\u2019t I ever find the right person to roleplay with? Did you find someone who you enjoy rping with? How! Because I feel like I\u2019m screaming into the void\n\nAlright, phew. Feel free to leave your own pet peeves!",

Every once and awhile I\u2019ll come across a person or ad that states something akin to \u201cI prefer romance but if there isn\u2019t any then that\u2019s okay and the rp doesn\u2019t have to be romance exclusive\u201d or something similar. I personally, very rarely rp romance and when I do it\u2019s under specific situations (the beginning plot not focusing on any romance and relationships developing naturally) So I\u2019ll reach out. We\u2019ll get to talking and then I\u2019ll mention that I don\u2019t really rp romance (tho I\u2019ll explain the situations where I do) but saw that they said that was cool. Then they say that they don\u2019t think we\u2019ll work out and parts way. It\u2019s actually happened several times.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t care if people wanna rp romance, you do you, it is soooo frustrating when they say they don\u2019t mind no romance but then immediately turn around and say they don\u2019t wanna rp if there isn\u2019t any. Like why even say that you\u2019re cool with no dating if you are? I don\u2019t care if you are looking for it, just don\u2019t say you aren\u2019t then. \n\nAnyway small rant over, thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if anyone else has felt this way, but I have come to the conclusion I need to call off doing any kind of smut. Outside of the people I already RP with and know for a fact are over 18, I'm not doing it any more. I have put warnings on my RPs, saying they are NSFW and 18+. And naively I guess I thought they would follow the rules? Or if that they weren't 18+ I would quickly pick up on it and stop the RP. I think part of my brain has just assumed \"oh if they're underage they wouldn't know about this sexual stuff so in depthly. I'll be able to tell from how they talk.\" It is selfish and dismissive on my part. And then also.. I remember, I used to lie about my age and smut when I was a minor. I don't know how good my writing was, but I knew a decent amount about this sexual stuff. And honestly, any of them could be underage. Even if I asked for ID or something, that could be faked. I'm 21 now, it's time to swear this stuff off. The idea that one of the people I have written smut with could be underage is so disturbing to me. I keep going back and forth with this and thinking \"oh no, surely they're not underage, I would be able to tell\" and I need to put my foot down. If I have doubts about the age of these people, I should stop for good. This post is a last straw of sorts, writing it down and making sure I remember to swear this off. I think people smutting should become more mindful about this and be stricter about it. I don't know how many minors are truly going around looking for this kind of stuff, maybe I am just paranoid.

People who are afraid to be honest\n\nYa'll please.\n\nPlease, just damn.\n\nFirstly, lazy rpers.  You guys waste my time so much and I get so frustrated that I have to twist your arm to talk to you, on top of you never replying to the point that I just give the server over and leave the RP.   Or people who say they don't want to put forth the effort to write more, even though there are things to reply to. Damn, get a different hobby or someone who is on your level.\n\nYou guys who lie.  I get it, you want to do an RP and it sounds cool, so you lie about it in hopes of squeezing by with your shitty posts that don't meet the basic requirement.  I will never understand why this is a thing or why it won't stop being a thing.  If you came to me honestly, showed interest and was honest, I could change my mind or we could discuss a compromise. \n\nAlso, can we stop using the: 'i focus on the characters not the grammar' and 'i don't use grammar it's like stream of consciousness and i don't want to read what i wrote'.  stop it. not a single person believes you.  every person I met who uses these excuses are shitty at writing AND story telling, if not rping a mary sue already or a terrible character.  You suck at writing and characters.  I'm not going to buy it, no one buys it.  This is a writing hobby, write with someone on your level.  Don't expect someone to write you 5 paragraphs to your 4 sentences that make no sense. \n\nYo, if you don't like something, just say so.  Removing/blocking/being rude to someone is not needed.  Just make a real excuse, tell them that you misunderstood the ad and it isn't what you were searching for or maybe you feel too overwhelmed by the plot and need to go for something simpler.  Blocking someone in mid-explanation of the plot you were interested in is a shit move. \n\nThat's all, lol.",

I have a boyfriend irl who always knew I rped and that I wrote ships (because am a SUCKER for romance) but one day I felt so much guilt to write ships and sometimes smut and I talked to him and he said it was okay because it was not me and I said 'God of course its characters' but that didn't clear my problem. The anxiety wouldn't leave. With time I just realised I was embarrassed of myself for having had this hobby for many years and it's almost a year and I still feel so much anxiety and embarrassment.\n\nSomehow, I am writing to you for reassurance or to ask if any of you have gone through this. \ud83d\ude2d I am tired.

Today, I come to you with a half-rant, half-curious sort of post that I hope will make some kind of sense to anyone reading. \n\nLately, I have seen some requests specifying that a potential partner must not be ESL in the \"grammar\" section that writers usually include in their posts. This has sort of confused me as both I, and most of my partners or members of RP communities I'm part of, aren't even from the US, UK, or any country where English is the native or predominant language. \n\nNow the thing I've seen paraded on other websites as well is how ESL people inherently struggle with English or automatically have a poor grasp on sentence structure and...I honestly can't understand it? I've seen people who wrote equally lazy, half-assed replies or make horrendous spelling errors and happened to be native speakers. \n\nI know it all boils down to preferences, but this one seems particularly silly as COVID has hit the RP scene with a massive upsurge of people who simply want to write, and I feel like this may push them away. Not to mention you'd essentially be cutting out a significant portion of people who may have found your ad interesting to begin with.",

            "selftext": "This is my favourite subreddit. I browse it every day, respond to things when they catch my eye. Lately I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of despondent writers, people who are tired of the exhausting game that is finding potential partners. Because it is exhausting! It\u2019s kinda fucked, actually. It\u2019s like the Wild West out here. \n\nI guess this is just me saying, to everyone here who posts their entertaining, upsetting, irritating or downright hysterical experiences\u2026 Don\u2019t give up! There is someone out there for you, and you might luck out and find them.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing with partners since I was 10-ish. I\u2019m 20 now. As some of you will know from experience, that\u2019s actually not very long compared to our more seasoned friends! I\u2019ve used forums, amino, geeking, kik, discord and reddit. I have seen some shit. \n\nIn my latest search for partners, over the past two years, nothing has stuck. Ghosting or being ghosted, no chemistry, weirdos who break the basic rules of roleplay. My god, it\u2019s brutal out there. (My sincerest apologies if we\u2019ve written together and things didn\u2019t work out.)\n\nLast November, however, I got a message from someone on here. Very basic, just a reply to my ad that showed interest. We exchanged discords. She admitted that she hadn\u2019t seen the show I wanted to write. She told me about the character she wanted to use. His face claim was an actor I had loved since I was a child. We started the plot - her writing was lovely. The chemistry between the characters was instant, and electric. We started chatting frequently every day, spitting out ideas and concepts and slowly creating a world around our two characters.\n\nShe watched the show, and she loved it. I dug that kind of dedication. We gushed regularly about each other\u2019s writing, started writing our own standalone fiction from the world we created. Exchanged photos of our cats, talked about our lives, comforted each other. Our characters fell in love in the most beautiful, natural way I\u2019ve ever encountered in my own writing. Proper slow-burn romance that ticked all the right boxes. \n\nSoon we had multiple threads, because we ended up adoring the side characters we created and wanted to see more of them. I think we have three or four main pairings, and over a dozen main characters. Our own universe. Countless alternate universes, headcanons and subplots and scene ideas.\n\nOnly about two weeks in, I stopped religiously checking the reddit roleplay listings. As it stands, I haven\u2019t gone looking for another partner since then - because I know that whatever craving I have, she\u2019ll be up for exploring it.\n\nThat was nearly a year ago. Again, not super long in terms of writing partners. But I can safely say I\u2019ll never need to post an ad on reddit again, unless something goes drastically wrong, because she is everything I ever wanted in a writing partner. I\u2019ve never been so creatively fulfilled in my life, and she\u2019s one of my dearest friends.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the moral of the story is, other than my thesis statement: don\u2019t give up. If someone as picky and neurotic as myself can find the perfect match, so can anyone. Let people surprise you, be open to new ideas and still uncompromising when it comes to what matters. So many of you are such talented writers, and it really does suck to wade through all the bullshit - but happiness awaits! \n\nI truly believe there\u2019s somebody - or multiple somebodies - for everyone. Cheers for sitting through this drivel, and I hope it helps even one person to keep looking.",

I have no idea why he is writing with me, to be honest.  He shows every indication of being incredibly enthusiastic about the RP.  He responds promptly and following a predictable schedule, he is excited to worldbuild with me OOC, and is always throwing out ideas.  But he can easily write 2-3 times more than I can, and with beautiful descriptions that I lack.\n\nHe will frequently rephrase something I said in my post in a prettier way.  I might spend two paragraphs describing a garden, and he'll take four or five to go over it again, adding embellishments and new details to what I already said.\nI should appreciate that.  I should be happy he cares so much about the RP that he puts in that extra work.  Obviously he recognizes I am not a strong writer but must like something else about me.  Maybe my enthusiasm or my ideas, who knows.  But I'm so disappointed with my mediocre writing.  I keep trying my best but it's never good enough.\n\nI wish he would at least tell me what it is about me he likes, but I can't do that without seeming insecure. (Which I am.) The few times he has complimented me it has seemed insincere, like he was obviously just trying to reassure me/build up my confidence. It's also probable that he's settling for me because our RP covers a really niche topic.\n\nI'll let it go.  The RP is the best thing to happen to me lately so I'm not going to ruin things by bitching about something that can't be fixed.  There's no solution here... I can't magically write at his level, so it'd be better not to simply stop worrying about it and be glad I have a great partner.\n\nJust wish I could turn these feelings of inadequacy off for once. :/",

            "selftext": "hi all! i hope you're having a magnificent day. :) \n\ni'm just here to more so vent, like i'm sure many people are, about some certain partners i've been running into recently and it's sort of eerie because they all follow the same pattern. \n\nfirst of all, let me say i just got a new job. i'm a full-time worker, and when i have time, i'll hop on my discord and whip up some roleplay replies. i've found a way that helps me balance my real life, and my hobbies which is great! but let me just say -- i always warn my partners that i work a lot and if they don't want to wait a few days for a response, that i'm probably not the partner for them. \n\nin the past days, i've gained about five partners. great! within two days, i lost three of them. i worked a double shift (i picked up for my coworker, he's very sick and i felt bad for him!!) and i was dreadfully tired. when i had the chance, i went to explain to my partners that i'm sorry for the wait and i will respond to them asap, but literally in all the servers i made for us, they were gone lmao. \n\ni mean, i'm not too hurt about it because we never got past the planning phase, but i'm just shocked at how impatient people are and that i wasted my time creating servers for them to only go to waste. i mean, the one guy even said, \"i'm in no rush\" to leave just a day later. i get feelings might change, which is understandable, but they make roleplaying feel like a chore, not a fun hobby. regardless, my other two partners are great and i enjoy writing with them a lot! \n\nanyway, thanks for reading my vent! bye bye!",

I'll add you on Discord if we're compatible, and it's not some random BS that has nothing to do with the ad I posted.\n\n&gt;\"Hi!  My name is Alex, I'm from Wisconsin and I love hiking.  My favorite TV show is the Simpsons and I loooove Hibachi.  Here's a pic of my cat!\"\n\nAre you lost?  This is not a dating site.  You couldn't bother telling me anything about character or plot ideas but thought it was important for me to know your favorite tv show... because my post was FxM romance you think you're going to date me *and* my character, right?  Wrong.\n\n&gt;\"I don't use Discord, how about kik?\"\n\nSure.  I'll just take your word for it that you can type out well formatted, grammatically correct paragraphs with your thumb into a mobile phone.\n\n&gt;\"Sent you a PM!\"\n\nI call these people \"the campers.\"  They post publicly on your ads, I guess so they can warn other people away.  Sorta like signalling \"hey guys, this one is mine.\"\n\nAlso... there's a certain guy hanging around Reddit who will comment on M4F posts asking the OP, \"Do you plan to ever write a version of this for male applicants?\"  NO YOU IDIOT, the poster is a straight male who wants to write with female characters, which is why he puts M4F in all of his post titles!  How can anyone be so dumb?",

But I always use the doubles policy, if you do something I like on my end I'll do whatever you like for you.  \n\n\nWhether it be someone looking for a cannon ship, their own oc paired against a cannon character, or an entirely separate fandom I would do it for them in return for them roleplaying what I requested.   \nI'm more here to talk about how I wish I could find more people to roleplay One Piece with.  \n\n\nI understand not everyone likes doubling or ocs in general, but I really give a lot of potential to do something in return for the person. I really try to make roleplays better for the people I write with. I made my responses longer, started producing them with better quality and in shorter times, making my own oc pages long in google docs so she wouldn't feel one dimensional, etc.   \n\n\nI do this for a lot of fandoms, but with my hype fixation on One Piece in general its disappointing to say the least. I don't know if it's because I'm doing something, if my plots aren't interesting, if I need to work on my writing or if I should give up all together.  \n\n\nI just want to actually enjoy a roleplay where I feel like I'm making my partner enjoy what we're doing.",

But I tend not to know when to shut up so LOL ( yes I made this account just to ask this ). \n\nOkay so be me. Join an rp group. Love it their. This is the requiem Giorno Giovanna prophesied. \n\nSo I have a LONG history of getting burned in rps. Probably cause I\u2019m too nice but that\u2019s a vent for another day lol. \n\nSo I meet this girl on the server, I\u2019ll call her Jen. So me and Jen hit it off. Jen is funny and lively and we have a similar sense of humor. Her characters? Phenomenal. It\u2019s clear she puts a lot of work into them. \n\nSo Jen at some point, privates me asking if she can ship her character with mine ( side note: before this when asked who she thought the character in question would be head over heels for, she chose my character. I said that was cute. And then a few days later asked to have them. Alright back to the story. ). I of course say yes! Me and Jen are friends, and I\u2019m extremely exited to have a ship with her. So we plan how things will go it\u2019s great blah blah. \n\nCue the downfall cause nothing gold can stay I suppose. \n\nSo for a few days I sorta notice how she seems to be obsessing over a character owned by the person who I\u2019ll call\u2026Xion. So Jen seems REALLY into Xion\u2019s oc. Okay cool understandable. And then starts trying to make a bunch of headcannons of her and Xion\u2019s OC. Uh oh\u2026\n\nSo we are talking in public chat and Xion is speaking on their OC. Jen goes \u201c well I was gonna give [oc name] to [my user] BUT look\u2019s [xion\u2019s oc] might just be getting them LEL! they\u2019re just too cute! \u201c followed by more boasting about Xion\u2019s OC while I\u2019m still there and them going back and forth like I\u2019m the monkey in the middle.\n\nI\u2019m pretty much floored and hurt at this point and at a lost for words. I felt that this was coming but assumed she would you know, just tell me since we\u2019re friends. Nope!! Silly rabbit!! Truth is for kids!!\n\nSo I ping her and said \u2018 if you want them to be with [xion\u2019s OC\u2019s name] that\u2019s fine. Lol. I understand! \u2018 and Jen ignores the message, and changes the subject by going \u2018 I think [ my OC\u2019s name] would look gorgeous in this outfit! Right?? \u2018 \n\nNow I know there\u2019s no way in hell she didn\u2019t see my message lolololol. So I just stop responding. I vent to my friend and they tell me \u2018 nah Jen is being rude you have the right to be mad. \u2018 but somehow I feel like just maybe I\u2019m over reacting due to being burned in the past or somethin\u2019. As of now Jen still has not officially canceled our ship but I can tell that it has been abandoned faster then Toy\u2019s R us. And honestly, not even sure if I even want the ship anymore even if Jen did tell me that she still wanted it, I\u2019m just so irritated lelz. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to go forward with this so advice would be nice. Please be gentle with me I break easy clearly. \n\nI guess it\u2019s true what they say, \u201c you either crack that solja boy or you live to watch it crank you. \u201c and I\u2019d say I\u2019ve gotten cranked pretty hard with this one.",

            "selftext": "**Our RP, the scene in question:** My last post had my character agreeing over text to meet up with my partners character so they could tour an area together, due to my character having 2 hours free during the afternoon. My partner then posted, skipping us ahead to the next day with his character arriving and meeting up with mine. So far so good. BUT he then took our characters through the tour with a general summary and then ended the post with our characters parting ways without any actual interaction we had written together. The way he ended his post, there wasn't much I could do given his character had left the location entirely after taking control of the entire 2 hours they were exploring without any real interaction or conversation to share. I haven't yet replied to it as I'm a little stumped.\n\n**My feelings:** I was really taken aback because it felt pointless for my partner to move things so quickly and in a one-sided manner. To preface this, we both tend to post 2-3 discord sized posts as we a more novella/lengthy writers. But for intimate scenes, I have no qualms about editing posts so they're just 1 or 1.5 discord posts (maybe 3-4 paragraphs). The following is what happened in the OOC when I asked if we could do some actual back and forth together for the scene, considering our characters had 2 hours to kill together and we could sum up the rest of their outing once we felt we gave them some development. Keep in mind the characters are also acquaintances so they do need that build up.\n\n**The OOC:**\n\n- Me: With your post wrapping up their visit, would you like to have a bit of back and forth with them exploring/chatting before wrapping it up? Or would you want me to skip ahead to maybe the next week or when they might meet up again?\n\n- Him: I figured we'd have some back and forth. I wasn't entirely sure how to deal with that, honestly. If you wanted to just assume we'd chatted and you could make up information for Anya to use, go for it.\n\n- Me: If you want to have some back and forth with shorter posts for the scene, we can do that. You could tweak your post's ending and save the last paragraph or two and use it when we do wrap up their outing. Or if you'd prefer I make a more summarized version, I can do that instead.\n\n- Him: Either way. It felt too short if I didn't include more stuff about what they were seeing, I guess. I wasn't sure how to fit in conversation, I guess. It's harder to do with long responses.\n\n- Me: I wouldn't worry too much about the length if we want more conversation. I think making observations can add detail but I also know if we get too ahead of a scene then we're doing a lot of backtrack. But it's up to you.\n\n- Him: I'll try different pacings, and see what works.\n\n**My feelings continued:** I left the OOC at that, as I had guests arriving and hoped he might edit his post if I didn't reply with mine yet. But he never edited his post to let us have any back and forth dialog or interaction with our characters even though he said he wanted back and forth too. I love long posts, I do! But I also know how difficult long posts can be when you're doing an intimate scene, it makes for a lot of backtracking which can be annoying at times. Should I have just outright asked him to edit it so I could contribute? I feel like he was just brushing off my concerns about him bulldozing the scene which I expected, would be more than a post one person summarized. I expected it to be at least 5-6 posts before we would need to skip to the end. \n\nAt the moment, I'm not sure how I want to reply to the post itself, I feel like I'll just be affirming his character's observations and going through those motions as I'm not at all interested in making up a conversation myself without having my partner to bounce off, you know? \n\nHas anyone had this issue and know how to get their partner on the same page? Or how I could have expressed myself more clearly? I've run into a few instances with this partner where there's been misunderstandings/miscommunications and we've only been writing together for the past 5 days. Maybe we're just not on the same wavelength? \n\nIn all my years, I haven't had someone want to rush through a whole scene like this before and it honestly left me both baffled and annoyed. Maybe I'm overreacting but it just felt like a pointless endeavor if it was gonna be rushed? I don't want to skip to another point if it's out of my hands you know? I understand it takes some time for partners to develop a pace together but to sum up an outing on your own without input from your partner just feels so strange to me.",

            "selftext": "I think one of my RP partners is trying to \"nicely\" ghost me. They were nice ooc and I enjoyed our roleplay. They couldn't post regularly for a little while because of life stuff, but when that life stuff was over they still weren't really posting until it eventually stopped. They kept telling me they're busy but that they'll reply soon, they just have no time to write, which would make sense. But it seemed like they were always online doing something. I got curious and checked their reddit and they had very recently went looking for a new roleplay. So them not having time had to be a lie, right?\n\nI wanna be clear that I don't care if people have other roleplays on the side - I do as well. But I don't like feeling lied to. So I asked them point blank if they wanted to stop. They swore up and down they didn't and that they would get back to it. But they still haven't. I feel like I can't look for another RP partner to fill that gap because I'm still holding out hope, but it feels not great, like they just don't want to look like a bad person. Thing is, if that's the case then they're stringing me along and stopping me from potentially finding someone who will stick around longer. Has anyone experienced this kind of thing and can tell me if I'm just being paranoid, or if my worries are justified?",

            "selftext": "happened a while back and it's still one of the strangest interactions I've had.   \n\n\nTo start off, I'm a huge fan of boxing. A huge fan, always ready for a boxing story. Not exactly common in the RP world, though, so when I saw a post for one, I was willing to put up with *anything*. Bad grammar, bad spelling, two words, anything, whatever, just give me a boxing story! \n\nThankfully, the poster said she was very competent in boxing and boxing history and she *demanded* any repliers be as well. This would be based in the 70s, an era I adore, and be more focused on the training aspect, which is great! She wanted romance and mentioned the trainer's daughter possibly being the love interest, I could work with that! All her requests met mine, in literacy and length, I could just see this being such a great time, I already had the gears turning. \n\nFirst chats went fine, she was friendly if not a little wishy-washy on what she wanted from my character. She said she had already done this RP with the romance being between her boxer and the trainer's daughter, so she was looking for something fresh. YET, any ideas I tossed her way were shot down until she decided she wanted me to play the trainer's daughter. Little bit of a pink flag, there. Not the worst thing, but not the best thing. \n\nThen...then she sent her character sheet for the boxer. His name was Rocco. His art and face claim looks exactly like Sylvester Stallone, he grew up a poor kid boxing in a trashy gym in Boston, I got that far before writing her that I love Rocky! Her response? Rocky is a stupid movie. It's not realistic at all, she only wants realism, and it's very dumb, she just keeps writing and spamming me with things she hates about Rocky and how her character is definitely *not* Rocky at all, even if his name is close. His name isn't all that's close. I keep reading. He's the Heavy Weight champion of the world(like Rocky), it's 1976(the year Rocky came out), he's dumb and shy and just little things lining up to make his Rocky image solidify. Sure. Rocky sucks.\n\nOther details started to stand out. In two years, he went from a poverty stricken, PTSD crippled Vietnam vet to owning a multi-million dollar mansion and being the most popular boxer in the world, all in a trashy inner city gym. Kind of like Rocky. Kind of unrealistic, maybe even. Then I noticed, he's a Heavy Weight. At 177 lbs. The Heavy Weight class starts at 200 lbs. I bring it up, she freaks out. Spams the chat, lighting speed. She denies that he could be a Light Heavy Weight, a more proper class, even if it ends at 175, and then says that Light Heavy Weight didn't even exists in the 70s. Not true! It's one of the oldest weight classes! I prove it to her and she says her PTSD made her forget, then quickly moves on that he's too heavy, **by two entire lbs,** to be a Light Heavy Weight and he would totally be a Heavy Weight!   \n\n\nNot true! I try to say that he's 23 lbs out matched by the lowest weight in the class, and that is a *lot* of weight in the world of boxing. That weight could be made up by height or even worse, functional muscle. A nearly 30 lbs heavier guy could hit a lot heavier, and the lighter guy has far more stamina and speed, just as examples for why it matters. It's not a good match for an honest fight. That's why there's nine hundred weight classes, for honest matches! That's why guys slim down or bulk up! That's a facet of training, minding your weight in either direction! I couldn't get a word in, she was *spamming* the chat with how it's 'only' 23 lbs and he's far, far too heavy to be a Light Heavy Weight, then immediately jumps into how she plans on our characters to meet and *what she wants my character to look and act like.*   \n\n\nI just left it at that. I spoke way too fast saying that I would endure anything just to write boxing. Honestly, the only negative thing about being a Light Heavy Weight is that it would detract from his integrity of being an edgy clone of Rocky.",

            "selftext": "A little warning: This vent includes mentions of sexual assault as a topic in roleplays.\n\nIn my mind, questions are mostly fine. Some aspects of a roleplay can be changed, but for me, there is a difference between requirements and minor aspects. Requirements are stuff like romance or non-romance, the length of the replies, post frequency, the age of the roleplaying partner, the gender of the character someone wants to write, the genre of the roleplay or if it fxm/mxm/fxf (and some other stuff, depends on the search). Most of the time, getting asked to change anything about that is super annoying. There is a reason why this stuff is a requirement. Sure, if you ask me if some NPC queen in my story can be a little younger than she is in the description because it will fit better into the timeline you have in mind for your character, or if your character can have a special ability that isn't explicitely mentioned in the prompt, go right ahead and I will think about it.\n\nBut...\n\nEspecially if a certain requirement is mentioned multiple times in the advertisment, people don't want to change it for you. Believe me, if there is a whole paragraph like 'I want to write longer replies, I hate one liners, I love to be really descriptive in a roleplay (and so on)' or 'Today, I'm searching for an mxm roleplay again, I haven't written something like that in a while and I'm really interested in writing a mxm roleplay again. I have enough fxm roleplays at the moment'   and you send them a message saying 'Hey, would you also be fine with writing one liners?' or 'Love your idea, but can we do fxm instead?' they will think you are trolling them. Just don't. Especially people who write fxm and want to write the female role for once will know the annoying feeling of getting only messages like 'Love it, but I want to be girl!' and it wastes everyone's time.\n\nIf you absolutely have to ask a questions like that, please do so in the first message after introducing yourself. Nothing is more annoying than getting your hopes up after reading a dozen messages about how someone loves your idea just to be hit with  'By the way, we have to change (core aspect of the idea) or I'm not interested' or 'I just remembered that I can't fulfill (thing that is absolutely necessary to make the roleplay idea work), so we have to change it now'. \n\nPlease don't send people potentially triggering stuff without a warning.\n\nI always see comments that questions or pitching your own story instead without asking isn't harmful/that bad, and most of the time I agree. If your story is just some fluffy love story, it is most likely mildly annoying, but I don't think twice about it and just tell the person that I am not interested. But if your question entails asking stuff like 'would it be okay for you if my character (description how they sexually assault my character in detail) in the past?' or if you try to pitch your story ideas that have highly controversial topics (like someone writing a pedophile, or sexual assault, blackmailing someone into having sex with someone, or writing a roleplay about terrible historical events that happened in real life and are still a very sensitive topic or many people)... don't wonder why people are 'overreacting'. These topics are called sensitive for a reason, and some people have very bad experiences with that kind of stuff and don't want to suddenly be reminded of that because you can't be bothered to write your own search. This behavior is especially terrible if you send these kind of messages without even reading any part of their search. A lot of times, people send stuff like that even though a person has already detailed in their search how sensitive a specific topic is for them, and if they ask the other person 'WTF, why would you send me this disgusting prompt?' the other person excuses themselves by saying 'Don't overreact, I did not read your search, I send this prompt to everyone'...that is not an excuse. Please, just stop.\n\nIf you think that you absolutely have to do it for some reason, at least warn them and only send the prompt if they seem interested, for example by asking 'Hey, my favourite topic is WWII, are you interested in that topic and would you also be open to include some controversial aspects? I will tell you more if you are interested' or 'Hey, I am interested in writing some darker ERPs, are you interested in that and what are your limits?' or something like that. Do not open the 'conversation' with a detailed prompt about how some prisoner is tortured by Nazis, or where a young woman gets assaulted (except if the one who wrote the ad said that they are interested in things like that, of course). It is in very bad taste.\n\nIf people say no to your question, that means no. It does not mean 'Let us have a discussion about it where I insult your preferences'. No, I don't care that you think not being able to reply daily is lazy, or that you think that every roleplay that does not include romance is unrealistic and I am childish for not wanting to write it, and it definitely not make me reconsider writing with you.",

            "selftext": "Yes, you read that correctly. With a heavy title like that, I think it\u2019s important to give some context. I met this person back in April. We\u2019ll call them Alex. We hit it off very quickly and made plots that were wonderful! What\u2019s more, we truly bonded in OOC. \n\nOr so I thought. As of last month, things started getting quiet. Okay, it happens. Alex assures me they love our plots and they are still interested. No problem, I can wait. But soon OOC stopped too. I get worried, so I politely nudge them. They tell me they\u2019re still very much interested, but will be checking into a metal hospital. Now as someone with mental health issues of my own, I can completely sympathize, even if I do not have the exact same diagnosis. I tell Alex to take all of the time they need. \n\nSo now it\u2019s totally quiet, as to be expected. This is where the wildness begins. As I\u2019m searching casually for advertisements on another site, I happen to see one that looks\u2026 oddly familiar. Sure enough, it\u2019s Alex, with our exact same plot, saying how bored they are, how they wish they could fill said plot because they have nothing to do etc. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just outright pissed, but still want to give the benefit of the doubt. So when I politely ask if they wanted to stop plotting they say, \u201cYeah, I kind of made that up, sorry\u201d and was soon blocked. \n\nI just cannot fathom how people can go to such great lengths and create such fabricated lies instead of simply ending things. And if you\u2019re going to lie, why make a mockery of people who are actually STRUGGLING with that? \n\nThis is my wildest story of ghosting in a very long time. I suppose to end this, please take the time focus on your own mental health too. Do you have any crazy lie stories?",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m curious on your thoughts.\n\nI can be a busy gal sometimes. I myself have two jobs, run an online business and I run a few other projects on the side. Sometimes I can take awhile between posts, and I am blessed to have patient partners.\nHowever I have found recently my issue is that me and new potential partners will chat and plot for a solid day, I say I\u2019ll write first, I type up my opener and then\u2026 crickets\u2026\nThey still contact me, chat and share memes but I don\u2019t get anything for a reply. Maybe I\u2019m an asshole but for my previous roleplay partners who I a) have a history of writing with and so I know their writing is worth waiting and how they react to my posts and b) I generally have a lot more rapport and generally a solid friendship with them, I don\u2019t mind waiting long periods of time for replies. However, waiting a week or more for an opener post from a new partner just leaves me bored. I lose the excitement from the momentum that was the plotting and it feels almost fake to me when they message me to chat ooc, like making friends is great and all but I am looking for a roleplay partner, someone to share the hobby with\u2026 not just a friend.\n\nThoughts? How long is too long to wait for a reply to an opener post?",

            "selftext": "Ok so I have no idea if this was a jealous RPer or it\u2019s called something else but this all happened roughly a year ago. For context, this was a Harry Potter RP Discord server that was strictly OCxOC. So my OC, Emily, had a friend named Atlantic (bad RPer) and another friend named Ethel. She was friends with both of them, but considered Ethel her best friend and still does to this day. \n\nSo Atlantic was hardly ever online and I\u2019d often go weeks without hearing from her. So it makes sense that since Ethel was more active, Emily had more of a chance to bond with her. However, I guess Ethel being her BFF made her upset? She would come to my character and cry about how she was worried they were no longer friends which wasn\u2019t true at all. And even was under the impression that Emily was keeping a secret which wasn\u2019t true. Emily is very empathetic so it was her nature to comfort her. Although I think Atlantic hated Ethel because during one IRP class, my OC was talking to Ethel and decided to introduce her to Atlantic. \n\nHowever, Atlantic had to make the situation rather tense, and then later ran out of the class upset because I was interacting with Ethel. I think she thought Emily liked Ethel more than her. Later down the line, Atlantic\u2019s twin sister approaches Emily, Ethel, and the couple other people they were with and asked Emily if she would still be friends with Atlantic. Both IC and OOC this weirded me the fuck out and everyone else. Because what kind of a question even is that? She was creating drama without either of our OOC consent. Was Atlantic expecting me to be her only friend or something? I really don\u2019t know what her deal was or why she was obsessed with my character.\n\nLater on after not hearing from her in almost a month, I find out she deleted her discord account and I never heard from her again. \n\n**TL;DR:** badRPer creates drama between characters without OOC consent, got super jealous of my IRP bff, acted passive aggressively towards the bff, and got her characters\u2019 identical twin sister to awkwardly approach my OC to ask if she would still be friends with badRPer\u2019s character.",

Idk I have really bad luck with rp partners in general so mahbe it's just that but like... dude just because you're a dominant person does not mean you get to godmod and control every aspect of my character. And then there's the people who shame me for labeling my character... people have preferences. People are allowed to have preferences. If you don't have a preference, that's fine, but don't shame other people because they do. \n\nThat last part was kinda off topic but anyway, does anyone else know what I'm talking about? So often people who are strictly tops come across as almost standoffish, or rude, or frequently just not good at conversation... idk maybe it's just me. I know people who prefer to bottom get a bad rep too for making characters that are too uwu soft weak damsel and distress so I get a lot of people not wanting to write with me because of that, even if that's not how my characters are at all, the bias is still there and there's not much I can do about it.",

We try for a scene she's been wanting to play out, it goes really well. Her writing was good &amp; she liked mine equally. Thunderstorm knocks her power out. Well shit, at least she was kind enough to warn me preemptively know over discord. No biggie, I go to bed due to timezone differences &amp; leave her a notification.\n\nDay 2. She left me a sweet message apologizing and was really eager to finish the scene. Again everything went well, atmosphere was good &amp; she sounded really happy after we finished. Shows further interest in our characters progressing further. She has to go &amp; it was incredibly late so I went to bed and she left me messages on discord.\n\nFinal day. She pings me Good morning and alittle ooc flirting. She lets me know she's busy for the rest of the day so we spend alittle time together just chatting and enjoying the small window we had.
