Lists and images were sent to my DMs for me to comply with their wishes. \nI was informed that 'catalogue models' were not fit enough even for OC FCs. 'Get a Victoria's Secret model and then we could start writing'' The women were just as bad for trying to hijack my muses and turning them into famous actors and using their FCs. I've got 12 years RP experience and this was a revelation happening recently.. I'd not known anything like it before. \nThis is why I'm here on reddit and trying to locate more understanding and respectful partners .. \ud83d\ude01 Have a great weekend..",

Do you know the color of your own character's hair?  Is it long, short?  Do you have a general idea of his build or the way he carries himself?  Does he have laugh lines from smiling often, creases on his brow because he's a worrier?  This is a romance, you know, and in my prompt I gave you a wealth of physical details about my character to make it easier for you to see her in your mind's eye and experience attraction.

I love the roleplay as well, it's like awesome. \n\nBut recently with some stuff I ended up losing a lot of motivation to respond to this roleplay specifically. When it comes down to it, this roleplay has been off and on. When it started it was ON but then my partner stopped responding for a little while and didn't really actively talk all that much so my eagerness to roleplay was flushed. \n\nLuckily, they came back and we were right back at it. Except my attitude for the roleplay had changed. I wasn't as ON as I was before. I'd respond whenever I could and potentially it would take longer and longer times because I just had lost motivation for it. My partner has become relatively the same way (except quicker), but when they respond I don't want to keep them waiting for long because I really want to get to the good stuff and feel that connection between the characters again! \n\nWhat do you guys do when you lose motivation to respond to a roleplay you really love? Do you take a longer break? Do you find muse by listening to music or like reaching out? I would love to know because I really do love this rp and don't want it to go under!",

            "selftext": "Okay, so this hasn't happened to me too many times\u2014But golly, is it frustrating when it does happen. Having a little bit of self-control really does go a long way if you find yourself doing this to people. I wrote a long starter for this person (mind you, while we were in the midst of plotting) and they've up and vanished. This isn't the typical ghost, no, this is \"I was suddenly in the mood to roleplay \\[thing\\] but I lost interest 2.0 seconds so I'll just vanish now.\" And it gets worse when the idea or fandom they've advertised is pretty niche. Usually, it's difficult to tell this, but if you have access to their activity or some platform they chitchat on. It's pretty quick to figure out what happened.\n\nNow, I'm only assuming with this person because I'm a big ol' pessimist and maybe a bit of a drama queen. However, I've had someone do this to me before. On multiple occasions! And they even admit it too! Not directly, but when you can read what they're saying in their socials like: \"I have the urge to roleplay \\[fandom\\] !\" and they immediately make a server for it, invite multiple people, than delete everything 3 days later or never respond. It's kinda apparent what occurred. I can only give someone so many chances before I decide to throw the towel in.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen to them? Where it's pretty apparent the person is only dipping their toes into the water than leaving and moving onto the next sudden urge?",

            "selftext": "Yep, it's me again, but a different host who I have a lot more respect for than Host X I mentioned previously, Also, this is fairly long so there's a TL:DR at the bottom\n\nTo set the scene, this is a forum RP I've been playing on and off for 7 years or so, ((mainly due to it being slow and die to being in higher education at the same time))  but my experience has been mostly good... Until I started playing more actively again recently, \n\nDuring the past year and a half, I have admittly had some good points like finding some random weapons while exploring, acension and changing charicter  getting lucky with loot rolls, being offered a higher loot rill than normally allowed and doing unexpected well in an event aimed.at higher levelled players, but at the same time, I've had quite a few bad experiences that make me feel unable to progress in the main game, And while some of these were in other events, they do not bode well for the main game in my opinion.\n\n\nIn a summer event, the event introduction was playable and resulted in all the players being total party killed in order to set up the event, this in it's own seems pretty, I know, but it could of been skipped enterly. I wanted to raise a scene and call the host out, but the other players said I was over reacting, so that went nowhere\n\nIn a new year's event the same year, the event seemed like an innocent event with no mean twists, but in the playable introduction,.the host had every single player abburptly hard reset ((for the event only, but we have a confirmation a future story boss is going to soft reset the player charicters)) with no warning or indication that this would happen, I can't help but think that because we the players didn't speak up about the total party kill in the summer event, the host felt he could step it up a notch, and thus, went through with this and again, we mostly stayed quiet despite several players expressing frustration to each other. \n\nIn the main game, I have had 2 particularly nasty encounters recently, the first was an unprompted encounter with the leader of a powerful enemy faction ((a faction I had no prior interaction with too, also, this faction has covertly collected information on all the players without any indication given to the players in one occasion)) directly on my home turf base I'd been building up for most of my playtime, except me and my allies were not even allowed to try and interact with him or his forces due to allegedly being too scared to approch, while nothing came of this, I feel if he had decided he wanted my land, he could of just killed me and my allies and tore down ally hard work in the game Just like that, and his forces still lingered in my territory until I told the host how I felt about it ((this is partially  why I respect him more than host X and why I'm not as angry with him))\n\nVery recently I decided to actually get out of my territory and try to explore for once, but shortly into my journey, I encountered one of the host's NPCs, and he wanted to look at my weapons and trade with me, wanting a legendary weapon I won from an event, seemed fair enough, but none of the loot he offered seemed appealing or fitting to my playstyle, and some of it was even detrimental due to being cursed, trapped or potentally causing other characters to hunt me down if I took it, so I declined all the trades, instead of just letting me go on, the NPC decided to unleash their power, far beyond anything I had or could fight back against, and prepare to kill me, and probably would of done if I actually posted again before another player arrived to intervine. Worse, at the time this happened, even though the host deconfimed it later, I feel had reason to believe this NPC would killed me and just taken the weapon anyway, robbing me of a hard earned legendary weapon though Seemingly no fault of my own other than trying to explore the game world and make progress. (( My charicter is currently fleeing at the time of this)) \n\nNow, I want to build up so I can actually catch up to the longee term players who are several acension levels ahead of me (( I am A1 and can reach A2 now, but most of the other long term players are A4, and the gaps between acensions are quite large, plus they have more overall playtime than me)) but even that feels difficult as some of the resources and items I need are in the next story location, which is giving the long term players there considerable difficulty and as such because i'm so far behind, I feel I'll be utterly helpless there. While we don't yet know much, Some of the scientists there have very powerful reality warping powers, one used to be able to edit player's posts directly to influence events, this has been toned down after a call out but this scientist can still nullify all damage done to them unless The are incapacitated ((and the host has not disclosed how to do this)) and one of them can just erase people from reality. In comparison, only 2 of the players have even low level reality warping like space and time manipulation at their disposal. There's also other weaker, but still other powersul.high ranking scientists to disrupt and a project that seems aimed at stopping the player's progression involving 10 robots ((we don't know much about this yet))\n\n\nFurthermore, in an effort to encourage story progression the host has decided to have the antagonists there put a bounty on most of the players's charicters, most of the higher level active players have high bounties as you would expect, but I also have a bounty, albeit much smaller than the active players on my head, however, this feels less like encouragement and more like a malicious threat with no good reasoning behind it as during my time in the game, I haven't done anything to progress the story due to my inactivity and trying to find my playstyle, Nor have I even been to the location in question, and have barely even heard of the location in game. What's more, the other pacifists player doesn't have a bounty ((justified because of their faction)) and a player who is a higher acension level than me is also bounty free but for no reason other than the scientists Don't know they exist. These bounties are due to double in 300 posts time and we aren't even close to clearing this region, only 1 player is in a position to begin doing so and we have barely started. What makes it worse for me is the host is seemingly trying to push me towards that location, He has mentioned that I can get a free upgrade there and if I recall, some of my in game allies want to go there as well, unfortunately, given the past incidents and the bounty in place which feel more of a malicious, unjustified threat than any form of encouragement. \n\nI'm sure the other players have been through a lot too. But there's nearly 100,000 posts of this RP total and most of it is inaccessible due to being on a dead forum. So unfortunately, u only have my own perspective.\n\n\nTL:DR: had a fairly recent string of fairly bad events, mainly being TPK'd, hard reset, and almost losing my base and being killed in the main game for seemingly no justifyable reason, now feeling pressured to go to an area where I am far too weak to do anything  with a bounty on my charicter's head that makes little sense in my mind, and feels more like the host trying to pull me into a cruel trap. Not sure how to react if my fears are founded and how I should approch things going forward",

We talk plot stuff and the first couple of days will be great, but then it kinda fizzles out. I don\u2019t like hounding my rp partners to reply or comment on every second thing that happens in the story, but I do tend to personally feel a bit more invested in the overall set-up if I\u2019m comfortable with the person, I can trust them to communicate with me, and we can gush or get excited about developments in the rp together every now and again. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s unreasonable? I don\u2019t usually say anything if I feel like they\u2019re not the most interested in talking ooc or getting back to me often (I don\u2019t like feeling like a bother or like I\u2019m trying to be pushy because I have first hand experience with pushy rpers and I\u2019m not a fan), but at the same time I do kind of want to be friends with the people I rp with, and feel like I can count on them to not drop the whole thing out of nowhere or vanish mid-rp or convo for hours on end. But again, maybe I\u2019m just expecting too much? What are your opinions?",

Having a little bit of self-control really does go a long way if you find yourself doing this to people. I wrote a long starter for this person (mind you, while we were in the midst of plotting) and they've up and vanished. This isn't the typical ghost, no, this is \"I was suddenly in the mood to roleplay \\[thing\\] but I lost interest 2.0 seconds so I'll just vanish now.\" And it gets worse when the idea or fandom they've advertised is pretty niche. Usually, it's difficult to tell this, but if you have access to their activity or some platform they chitchat on. It's pretty quick to figure out what happened.  \n\nNow, I'm only assuming with this person because I'm a big ol' pessimist and maybe a bit of a drama queen. However, I've had someone do this to me before. On multiple occasions! And they even admit it too! Not directly, but when you can read what they're saying: \"I have the urge to roleplay \\[fandom\\] !\" and they immediately make a server for it, invite multiple people, than delete everything 3 days later or never respond. It's kinda apparent what occurred. I can only give someone so many chances before I decide to throw the towel in. \n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen to them? Where it's pretty apparent the person is only dipping their toes into the water than leaving and moving onto the next sudden urge?",

            "selftext": "I recently got reminded of this story and thought I'd share it here.\n\nI've been roleplaying for 7 years now and boy do I have stories to tell but this one is probably the best.\n\nThis rp happened in 2019, I posted an add on tumblr to do a kpop rp (i know some people don't like when it's about real people, that's not the point here).My post got me a few messages but here we'll talk about someone going by \"One\" (changed for anonymity). Ooc, One came off as very friendly and enthusiastic, we decided of a plot and characters to play and went at it pretty fast. \n\nI tend not to talk ooc too much unless it's discussing plot or availability but One kept messaging me about her day in between replies. She had just gotten a new, kpop related, tattoo and wanted to show it off to someone who would understand. Then she'd randomly tell me anecdotes about her daily life and her korean boyfriend. I didn't think much of it, thought it was just her personality or maybe she was lonely. She said she was from Iceland, living in Korea so I assumed she might not know a lot of people there and she was just seeking more company so I replied to her and kept being polite. I didn't ask any question unless what she said made little sense but she kept telling me about her \"life\".\n\nNow it's a few weeks in and while One wasn't super active (she chatted ooc a lot and often forgot to reply when it was her turn) we still got some rp going. She never seemed busy no matter the time of day that I would reply. I had an ever changing schedule at the time so I could be active early morning or late at night and I would get replies not too long after I sent my own reply. Everything is going fine, the rp isn't the best but the plot is something I've never done before with characters I love so I suck it up.\n\nVery randomly, in between two line, One tells me that she's pissed because someone took her waffles. I'm confused so I reply something like \"what?\". It's followed by a huge paragraph about how she's actually a translator for a kpop group and currently on tour with them. She tells me they are in X city, Y state USA (said like that) and that her and the group members are all in one appartement after a concert and they apparently took her waffle dinner and it's really not worth the thousand of euros she's getting paid for it. \n\nAt that point I'm feeling really awkward and confused because the group we are rping is indeed supposed to be in X city for a concert so she just implied she's working with/for them. If it's true, she's rping as people she knows irl. If it's not then wtf? I don't say anything, probably only \"haha, btw it's your line\" and I drop it. I don't ask questions and don't engage her but she keeps going some until I stop replying for a bit. The next day she sends me a picture with a famous US monument from the state she's supposedly in and talking about her \"day off\". Once again unprompted and after not engaging much with her she drops it. \n\nShe mentions the \"boys\" she works with again, talks about them as if they were friends and it makes me so uncomfortable I stop replying for a while. Eventually, I tell her that she's probably really nice but it's weird to pretend she actually knows \\[Redacted kpop boygroup\\] and I don't think I can go on with the rp.\n\nHer reply was \"I never said I worked with them, your loss\". That was such a weird experience. I really don't believe anything she said, the timezone didn't truly match, she told me how much she was getting paid in euros (I did tell her I was from Europe) when she's working for koreans, in the US and the country where she's from doesn't even use euros. Also I highly doubt that kpop groups share an appartement with their translators after a concert, if you know anything about kpop you know the risk of a woman being seen too close to the members of the group might create a scandal and I doubt they'd take such a risk. \n\nPlease tell me I'm not the only one who met some delusional rpers.",

I\u2019m the guy who comes up with oddball ideas or has uncommon interests, to the point it\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m known for among another place. With that said, I\u2019m fully aware that \u201cuncommon\u201d ideas are automatically going to be harder to gain attention just from their nature. Comes with the territory and I\u2019ve accepted that.\n\nSo, what I try to do to mitigate that is pretty simple. Try really, really fucking hard to write an idea or prompt in a way that shows effort, commitment and talent. I hold the belief that any idea, no matter how odd or out there, can be made interesting or attractive if well constructed and well written enough. \n\nYet it seems no matter how hard I try, it\u2019s not good enough. I never expected to be \u201cperfect\u201d, that\u2019s impossible and delusional to assume so, yet it\u2019s never enough it seems. Not enough for those who offer criticism and not enough to draw interest. It gets to the point of why fucking bother trying. Why bother putting in effort? They haven\u2019t looked every other time you tried, and if you try and ask for advice you\u2019re called a \u201cwish fulfillment seeker\u201d, when that\u2019s the very thing you\u2019re trying really hard to avoid. \n\nRant into the void over.",

            "selftext": "I mean it started off great, I was doing this enemies to lovers role-play with a guy I met on a different platform. We were really hitting it off. We had lots in common, his sense of humour was great and he was having some really great ideas we were discussing at the start.\n\nThen I asked him nicely for a description of his character and he said sure. But the description was super bad like, \u201cblack hair, blue eyes, average\u201d\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t the end of the world but like I said it was annoying, I brushed that off as if it didn\u2019t happen or whatever and then I gave him my description (which is very detailed btw) \n\n I got the thumbs up and then we started! He asked me to kick us off which I did. Now when I write the set up it usually ends up being a whole damn novel (maybe I\u2019m being dramatic but it ends up being decently long) and I wait patiently for response. In the end I got a two word answers and that was rather annoying. Once again I just leave it be and write a few paragraphs in response making sure to add lots of detail and try to continue building. I send it and once again. A two or three word  response. This  went on for a few messages then I nicely  asked  him if he could Maybe write a little bit more and he seemed offended so I let it go. This went on for ages as I kept asking nicely and giving him more chances but it\u2019s really hard to build a  story line alone in a two person role-play. In the end I just stopped responding.  Like\u2026 is it wrong to ask someone to write a little more or be more detailed?",

            "selftext": "Obviously this sub is about bitching about those really awful people. Ghosting after a long time. One line replies. Auto actions. And all that good stuff.\n\nBut let's talk about the mild end of things. The things that just make you laugh but something you could possibly overlook as you continue on. Who knows! Maybe you might help someone fix their own mistakes they're not aware of.\n\nI call this one **Put The Damn Thesaurus Away**\n\nSo this is the person that got me into Google Document RP. One of my biggest annoyances about Docs is I don't get notifications when a post is done, so we had to ping each other in Discord when a post was up. Which just made me go like....why aren't we doing this in Discord? I always back up my Discord RPs daily anyways. Oh well! Anyways, they were well written, sent me writing samples unprompted and we had a great idea that we co-wrote instead of my needing to come up with everything like what usually happens. \n\nTheir opener took 2 days to post. It was 10 pages long. BUT it was also a lot of world building and background. Hey cool, no problem. I could have lent a hand but they wanted to do this. But I noticed something in all this purple prose: they seemed to read an article long ago about overusing words so simply refused to call anything but it's simple name. As if mentioning a word a second time within 10,000 words was a crime punishable by death. I'm not one for minimum post lengths, I just don't want details to be left out, the mood to be missed, etc. With all the purple prose, my alert alarms started to go off, but I decided to stick with it because the story was going to be so interesting.\n\nIt lead to a lot of silly entries which I will post, with character name removed:\n\n\"Sun reflective fully black shade adorning his face, blocking out the color of his eyes from being visible.\" (Note: this is the one and only time the word eyes was used from his end for the rest of the 300 pages. He would use any other word to describe eyes from then on)\n\n\"The more wrinkled faced male offers a soft smile to his driver as he reaches to undo the clasped belt that crosses his frame in an upside '7' shape.\" (You mean a seat belt??????)\n\n\"The main headquarters for his younger friend, though to call the man he was currently on his way to see 'young' would be a betrayal in describing the man to those who would not know him. .CENSORED..... A man in his late 40s would not often be considered young but when viewed through the lenses of time, by one who was in his late 60s, it would help CENSORED to view him as such. Helped relieve the restrictions his own age sought to place on him, the difference between the two was not so great and so to view his friend as young in a way, would make himself feel young as well.\"  (Your guess is as good as mine here) \n\n\"took the key out from his pocket after fishing around for it for a moment and inserted it into the golden lock with a movement that said he had done so dozens if not hundreds of times\" (Is turning a key that hard?) \n\n\"He would look up at that point, oculars hard and sharp.\"  (an example of refusing to use the word eyes, 100 pages from the beginning)\n\n\nI'm just cherry picking these obviously and it's not a deal breaker, but just something that made me giggle (oh wait, I put giggle in the title. Should I use chuckle? Chortle? My chest vibrated as air was pinched through my throat in a repeated rhythm?)\n\nSo let's hear some of your funny \"bad mistakes\" that weren't deal breakers?",

But some were more reserved like if you didn't know how to write long lines or even make edits they will simply ignore you.\nIt makes me sad to see how many people leave the community because of that.\nI know what you are all thinking, \u201cjust because they were bad doesn't mean it's everyone. They're plenty of fish in the net.\u201d\nSpeaking of this issue makes me want to leave the roleplay community forever \ud83d\ude1e\n\nEnd of the rant",

But, it's still pretty annoying!  \nThis isn't the worst offender either, but this is one of my most common issues I have with people contacting me. Them just straight up not reading my search threads, or just finding keywords in my search and jumping with it, without reading any other context of my post.\n\nFor clarity, this particular search I had listed a list of cravings and plot ideas. I had a pretty clear idea of what I was looking for, and I made that much clear.  \nHowever, I DID have a section of ideas I would be willing to explore, but with a big ol' \\* next to it.   \nOne of those was \"Harry Potter/Hogwarts\". Next to the listing I wrote, plain and simple: \"I'm not actually looking for this theme right now, as I've got like zero ideas for it. *So if you message me, have an idea ready\"*\n\nI mean it, I was blunt. It was clear as day. But, despite that, here is the copy and pasted interaction I had with someone wanting to hit me up for an RP. \n\n**Person:**  I'd be interested in a Harry Potter roleplay over Discord. Would that be something you're interested in? \n\n**Me:**  Depends!  \nDid you have any ideas in mind? I tossed Harry Potter/Hogwarts on my interest list because... Well, I'm interested in exploring the lore, but unlike most things on my list, I don't have any ideas for plots or progression. But if you had something in mind, I'd love to hear it. \n\n**Person:**  If you have any ideas for plots, let me know, too. I will see if I can find some. \n\n**Me:**  I'm not sure if it was just missed, but in my search I stated that I don't currently have any plots in mind for a Harry Potter theme in particular. It's not something I'm super in high demand of doing, unless someone has something particularly interesting to shoot my way. \n\n**Person:**  What are you craving? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shit you not. My ENTIRE search thread was me listing out my cravings. It was all cravings. The whole damn thing. I just threw a few \"maybes\" (like Harry Potter), at the very bottom incase someone had some good ideas to send my way. \n\nAlso I'd like to know what magical place this person knows of where they can \"find some (plots)\". Lol, unless they meant think of any plots.",

He told me he would try to find someone. \n\nSome time later our new guy is introduced. We all seem to get along. I had a slight concern because his account was very new, but I thought it might be a throwaway account just for RP. \n\nLong story short, our 'new guy' was my original partner playing a second character. He gave himself away by using his own name at one point, instead of his 'new guy' name. It was so sloppy and dumb that it made me laugh at first. Then it made me mad. He had tried to deceive me and failed so quickly and so badly that my opinion of him just plummeted. He went from being an articulate and fun guy to being someone who wanted to manipulate me for his own amusement. \n\nIt's a shame, because I don't always click with people and I had trusted him. \n\nWell, rant over. From now on, I'll only RP with established accounts and I'll be even slower to trust people. If guys out there wonder why women are so cagey online, it's because of crap like this.

            "selftext": "This is about something that happened to me multiple times already, and it always annoys me. It's just a tiny bad, nothing serious.\n\nThe first story is about a guy I met in a forum, we shared some details about our life and I mentioned that I'm attracted to women after some weeks of talking ooc. We chatted a bit. About shows we liked, anime, just random art we thought was pretty, about the roleplay. Keep in mind that I never expressed any sexual/romantic attraction to male characters, and there was nothing nsfw going on. No talk about how I want to marry or fuck these character, I did not write stuff like 'OMG (character) is so hot I'm drooling right now.' \n\nIt was stuff like 'I really like Fujita's design' or 'When I read the novel, I didn't get the impression that (character) is as good-looking as they made him in the movie', or stuff like sending a picture of an anime character writing 'He looks interesting/This looks so pretty.' Or saying stuff like '(My female character) could be interested in (his male character), he might be her type.' It was always either a expression of how much I liked/disliked a certain design choice/actor, or about what my female characters would like. \n\nOne day, I got this PN after saying that a male character is my favourite in anime we both watched.\n\nHim: Can I ask you something?\n\nMe: Sure, go right ahead. \n\nHim: I always thought you were a lesbian.\n\nMe: Yeah.\n\nHim: So how can you like (character) or think that (actor) is good-looking?\n\nI was a bit stunned by this question. I never expressed any interested in dating these (fictional) characters. I never said that I personally find any of them sexually/romantically attractive. Despite being a lesbian, I can still find some men good-looking or even beautiful, that does not mean I want to have sex or romantic relations with them. And besides, a lot of these conversations where explicitely about what my straight female character would like. Not what I personally am attracted to. I explained that to him and he said something like 'I see.' I thought 'Okay, I can get why he misunderstood that.' and moved on. \n\nFor real life reasons, he took a break from roleplaying some weeks later. After about two months, we reconnected. Chatting a lot ooc again. One day I open the chat, what do I see? The exact same question. Is it really that hard to understand? He probably forget that he asked me that but I really don't think that this concept is that difficult to grasp.\n\nRight now, I'm roleplaying with a different guy. We shared some descriptions of our characters. And I remember writing something along the lines of 'Shy guys can be super interesting.' when he explained his character concept to me. Our roleplay isn't about romance or sex, so I thought it was pretty clear that I was not talking about being romantically interested in shy guys, just about my opinion that it might be interesting to write against a shy character in the kind of story we wanted to write. And even if I was interested in writing against a shy male character in a romance roleplay, that doesn't have anything to do with my preferences in real life. He immediately replied 'I couldn't tell you that, I'm personally only interested in women. I'm straight, I don't know anything about that.' And he already did this multiple times...every time when I say something along the lines of '(Character) might find your character good-looking' he is like 'I can't tell you if they would, I'm straight.' I know that you're straight. I'm talking about our characters and not our own real life preferences, damn.",

            "selftext": "Since I've enjoyed a few double-up roleplays myself, I have mixed feelings about this topic. I have first-hand experience with doubling up and the kinds of people you meet. You get a lot of self-centered people (as you would expect) but it can also be mutually beneficial, especially if you wanna do a fandom romance roleplay with an oc. It's kinda a \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" kind-of deal. I've met amazing people doing this kind of roleplay, but there's also a lot of roleplayers that are just obviously in it for themselves or are just... too much. In case you need more of a description on what doubling up is, it's essentially doing two roleplays at once. I like to negate this by making it feel more like one big story in the grand scheme of things (especially if it's fandom) because it makes it more inclusive and just fun all around, but some roleplayers don't like ocs interacting at all. That's fine, but lately people have started becoming a little too demanding for their own good. A lot of the roleplayers I come across want realistic faceclaims, long-term roleplay, slowburn, reply in a week, yada yada. \n\nThe part that gets to me is that I've started noticing a growing amount are raising their line count requirements to a minimum of 15+. That's about 500 words on the platform I use. It might not sound like a lot, but take into consideration that is the\u00a0*minimum*\u00a0for one side of the roleplay. The real minimum they're asking for is 30+ lines since you're doing double the work, but they're still expecting you to do way more than that. Keep in mind, these people also often have 4 or 6 other roleplays going on that they have to respond to in a week. However, don't expect them to actually do it. They'll take more than a week or to the point it'll almost seem indefinite. What often ends up happening is Dante's nine circles of infinite ghosting hell.\n\nIt's very, very annoying and this is why I'd just prefer me and my partner to just settle on no time limit if we're doing lengthy roleplays since all of the people I roleplay with are adults who have jobs or college students that will vanish or appear sporadically until the holidays come back. I'm fine with my partner being busy, but don't hold such unrealistic expectations for your partners and yourself??? \n\nWhat do you guys think? I'd value an outside opinion because I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong or not for thinking this is too much to handle. I never reflected on how much I was actually writing with line counts in these double-up roleplays till I actually started checking since the platform I use makes it all seem so much smaller. It made me realize why I was getting so burnt out while responding to multiple of these types of roleplays in a week's time.",

            "selftext": "The faceclaim debate is a wide gap in the community, everyone knows. There's growing demand that you *must* have faceclaim if you're contacting an RP seeker, and that's just dandy, however...I've noticed a weird trend. \n\nMost people ask that faceclaims be realistic. As long as it's not anime or something, then it'll get the job done. Fine. Recently, I've seen ads asking that faceclaims not be celebrities. A bit odd, but that's their choice to make that rule and the replier's choice to follow it. Then, faceclaims not be celebrities or models. Then again, faceclaims cannot be celebrities, models, or found on Pinterest. The most recent strict ad I read stated no celebrities, models, pictures from Google or Pinterest or Tumblr *or* Instagram, you must *own* the photo, and, no, it cannot be art. \n\nNot exactly sure how anyone is going to meet that requirement? I suppose this is the new method of fishing for people's seflies.",

            "selftext": "Ok I'll try not to turn this into an advice request but basically, I joined a forum that seemed pretty welcoming at first. Got a bunch of threads up, eager to start. Took up a role that had some family members attached. Other RPers seemed willing to plot with me when I asked. \n\nWell I got a few posts in with some, then it petered out. One RPer responded fairly consistently, but then just decided to have her character walk away sort of abruptly. When I asked if that was the end of the thread, she said yes, unless my character would try to stop her. And I was just like ok? :/ It gave me the impression she just didn't want to continue. \n\nThe other RPers with which I have threads are just plain not responding to them. Some seem a bit inactive in general but others I see responding to other threads. I don't think I did anything egregious in my posts to make them dislike me, but ofc I can't read their minds and I might have without knowing. A little part of me is wondering if it's homophobia because I mentioned in one sentence that he was gay and that was when one RPer stopped rping with me altogether, and as far as I can tell there aren't many LGBT characters on the site.\n\nI am feeling a bit rejected and I'm wondering what I've done wrong. BUT I also know I have a big problem with social anxiety and the rejection sensitivity that comes with it. So I'm wondering if it might be that. I'm not sure I can even talk to anyone about it because they don't know me and I think it might be weird for me to just come in there and look for reassurance.  Is this a lost cause? :( I was really into the character and the plot ideas.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! So.. I roleplay on Discord, and I've roleplayed on Discord for a few years now. It's the main way I roleplay now adays. I met \"Rachel\" around late Winter, early Spring time of this year on a roleplay discord group, and we almost instantly clicked. Unfortunately the group didn't work out for either of us, so we both left but we continued to RP with each other and even ran our own group together. Our group is still up and running to this day - but it's under new leadership because Rachel had some medical problems she had to deal with, and I was having some really nasty mental health issues. \n\nWe cut back on roleplay for awhile and focused on playing World of Warcraft, which is another interest we had in common. We had a 1x1 server, but she rarely replied to it, which was a little disheartening to me since I was really into our roleplays. Eventually though, I ended up finding a really cool discord group and I figured since my 1x1 with Rachel was a little dormant that I would join. When I started roleplaying with the group I thought I clicked really well with them and made friends with the server's owners. \n\nI told Rachel about the group and she seemed rather excited to join me, so I invited her. Things were happy for awhile. I roleplayed with her, and I roleplayed with some of the other people in the group. I was especially really happy to be roleplaying with her again on a daily basis. But one day, everything changed. One night Rachel told me she was thinking about leaving because she didn't feel like she fit in and that the server's mods ignored her. She claimed that the group was cliquey. \n\nI had grown attached to our new characters, and I was worried that things were going to go back to the way they were, and she wasn't going to be attentive with replies again if she left. We fought every night for 2-3 days, and I did everything in my power, including have her talk to the mods to fix things, but she ended up leaving and I was incredibly upset. \n\nI thought this group had the potential to destroy our friendship, since we had fought about it so much so I ended up leaving the group too. Rachel and I had managed to patch things up, and she came up with an idea to create another 1x1 server for those new characters that we created, which I was very happy about. \n\nWe currently roleplay on the new 1x1 but I still sort of miss the old group and I feel kind of sad and regretful that I left, because I got along with the people so well. I don't know if I should just join groups and not invite her in the future, or if I should just not join groups for awhile. She's a great friend, but I don't want her to ruin anymore group experiences for me.",

            "selftext": "So, I run a humble sci-fi roleplay group. It's safe-for-work and populated with mostly older teens and young adults. Overall, everyone knows how to behave, but there's one potential issue and I'd like to figure out a plan for how to deal with it.\n\nOne of the users is seemingly obsessed with lesbians. All of their characters are fairly forward lesbians, and there are some circumstantial pieces of evidence such as their profile picture and some of the things they say, which broadly point to thinking of lesbians as sex appeal.\n\nSome things I'd like to clarify:\n\n1. I don't have a problem with this person. They're perfectly friendly and we get along.\n\n2. I don't have a problem with LGBTQ+ characters in my server at all.\n\nAs most of you will already know, this is a very popular issue in online RP. That's why I'm considering acting on such little evidence.\n\nI don't know if I should pull them to one side and have a conversation about it. On one hand, I'd hate to look back and say I saw the signs but didn't say anything - And on the other, they haven't done anything worth an accusation. I also know very little about the roleplayer; for all I know, they could just be a lesbian who is super stoked about lesbians. \n\nSo I'd love some advice on what to do here. Should I watch and wait? Ask other members? Talk to them directly? Or am I just being a dipshit?",
