            "selftext": " Joined a new group. Got real excited after spending hours making a new character biography. Posted my wanted ads and RP requests. Reached out to start a scene with person A. We agreed. The scene started well,  decent writing, and an interesting premise with what we\u2019d discussed.   \n\n\nPerson B who was in a scene with Person A's character (suspicious. I have a feeling they were being possessive of Person B's character) wanted a scene with my same character and we discussed. A chain of in-character messages went well, and this person appeared excited OOC and their character excited IC.   \n\n\nSo to kill the momentum; I started a scene on my character with someone else. They read the starter and apparently he did something in that scene they didn\u2019t like. Suddenly, excuses are being handed out and I press a little bit. He did something in the starter they didn't like OOC  \n\n\nMeta-gaming, but fair. What wasn\u2019t fair was how they wanted to wave the magic void wand and void everything that happened. I calmly (calmly) stated to them it was unfair for them to write my character off and expect me to void everything because of what my other character did with someone else. They got defensive and decided that it was an issue of OOC compatibility and writing styles. That\u2019s that. I literally just said that\u2019s that and stopped.  \n\n\nTook the voiding and blatant meta gaming to the admins, used simple, neutral language very calmly (very calm). Explained the circumstances and why I believed it to be unfair. So: their answer was Metagaming and voiding are only rules in tabletop games and those more action-oriented, not a slice-of-life group RP (which is absolutely bonkers because I have never been a part of a group RP that acted like meta gaming and voiding shit freely was okay). I say to that effect, still using neutral language but eventually agreed to not cause a further stink but got asked to leave the group anyway. For asking questions and explaining my point of view neutrally?   \n\n\nSo correct me if I\u2019m wrong. The appeal of group RP Is organic interactions with structured rules and interacting with many people your character might not have otherwise. Their argument was at any time, the other writer had the right to withdraw consent and void anything that happened. Bullshit. I wanted to take their choice as an IC thing and create some interesting IC drama from it, but apparently, that\u2019s not allowed. In a group game. Because their pickiness and ability to lead people on is the most important thing.",

I mean, I... think they forgot, you can never really tell if it's genuine or not.\n\n I consider myself to be a really patient person even when I'm bored out of my mind because I know most of the people I roleplay with have college classes going on and I'm pretty slow at responding  so... I'm  fine with waiting, it's only fair in my mind since people put up with my occasionally snail-speed response time. However, this person said they'd respond \"tonight if not tomorrow for sure\" and it's been almost 3 weeks since I've written this starter. \n\nThey said that they like to take their time prior, but the fact they said \"tomorrow for sure\" makes me feel a little iffy about it - even though they initially seemed all for it.

In which small things like improper grammar and etc would irk me to no end. \n\nNow, I've relaxed, rp is a hobby (as its always been). \nRecently I've ran into an rper who does exactly what I used to hate. Doesn't capitalize sentences (usually), almost no punctuation, very short responses (even one liners at times), constantly misspelling things or sometimes sentences are hard to follow, accidentally mixing up my character for one in a different rp, forgetfulness (which just just be forgetfulness of the character). \n\nBut the roleplay I have with them is one of my favorites right now. It's so full of life and the character dynamic is to die for. \n\nSo, now, my question is has anyone else become lenient on rules you once had because of a roleplay has a special place in your heart? I'm just wondering because I used to call myself pretty elitist at one time when it came to rp. If you weren't roleplaying the way I was it was wrong.

I just wanted to thank the people who have reached out to me to offer their take on my romance situation. I bring you this update because things just got a little more interesting. \n\nI realized that I forgot to name the writers, so I'm going to do that here in order to sound less confusing...\n\nAaron - He is the writer for Harvey. \n\nMaggie - She is the writer for Selina and Rachel.\n\nAnne - She is another writer in the RP.\n\nAfter I made this post, the story continued with Bruce rescuing his little brother and Rachel's little sister. He gets them into his car and away from the zombie horde invading town. Rachel and Selina had gone with Harvey to get the rest of his group. \n\nMaggie had decided to take a short break from the RP to settle some IRL matters, so we were accommodating and worked around her characters. \n\nSeveral months have passed in the RP, and all the characters are at a new community. We decide that the characters should be celebrating something because they had gone through too much within a short period of time. Harvey's writer decides that it should be a wedding between Harvey and Rachel. \n\nMaggie hasn't been active to see the idea as of writing this post, so I imagine she'll be excited. \n\nMe? I decided to have Bruce play a song for them at the wedding. Since Maggie was gone, I implied that Bruce and Rachel had at least spoken at some point during those months. Anne, being the good friend that she is, suggested that Selina could be helping Bruce and they could dance together at the event. \n\nStory wise, I find it a bit rushed that Rachel and Harvey are now getting married after having only known each other for a few days before the skip. Her and Bruce had been friends for years, and I felt like it went out the window in a flash. At the same time, this is the zombie apocalypse and they are fighting a super bad group. \n\nCharacter wise, Bruce is a bit tormented about the whole thing with Rachel and Harvey. I think playing a song for them is his way of letting Rachel go for good. \n\nI guess I'll have to wait for Maggie to return to get her take. Bruce and Selina need more scenes together.",

            "selftext": "A couple of months ago, I joined a roleplay group. Incredibly complicated lore and old characters played for ten years. There were a few canon characters as old as all the other characters and I volunteered to take one, which I would quickly come to regret. I had to basically take a job interview with rigorous questions about how I was going to play him. After taking this character, the owner was immediately obsessive about the character and had a very rigid view of how he should be played after telling me I had complete liberties on how to play the character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it started with us in a scene on a private server; She bombarded me with messages if she saw I wasn't online and didn't reply to her long rapid-fire smut immediately. Anytime I played the character in another scene with another character, it evoked an argument over how I was playing him, and canonically he wouldn't have an interest in other characters. So I agreed, played him the way she wanted, but we had a few arguments concerning how he should be played. She always kept coming back to the point he was interested in another character or that I wanted to write with them instead of her like a jealous girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will put up with a bit of drama and conversation on how the character should be played because it was obviously a character very near to her heart, but I also put a lot of effort into his biography and making him my own. So we wrapped up one scene; I needed to take a break as I wouldn't have time to rapid-fire and she got upset with me. I took a week hiatus anyway and told her I needed a few more days and she changed the rule of the server so characters had to be active once a week instead of once every two weeks. Basically, we argued more, and it came down to the age-old \"I'm the owner, you have to do what I say\". I was like, \"wateva I do what i want\". She banned me for \"refusing to play the character.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoral of the story: Be careful what you sign up for. xD",

I laughed more than I should have, and now my husband thinks I'm a crazy person because I couldn't stop laughing with every re-read.\n\nSo, in the midst of an intimate scene (not hard intimate, but intimate none the less), I was describing a kiss between the characters. Mine gingerly cupped each side of the other character's head, before \"swiftly killed him\". I then describe the kiss she shares with the character with decent detail. After of course, she had just swiftly killed him.\n\nObviously, I meant to write \"she swiftly kissed him\", and thankfully my partner realized right away it was a typo even though grammatically, the post still made PERFECT sense even if she had killed him instead of kissed him. That post almost ended on a very dark note.\n\nIt probably didn't help that the roleplay was already a psychological horror, so honestly...

            "selftext": "What annoys you the most that proficient role-players still might do?\n\nHere's my list\n\n1. **Forced/mechanical paragraph lengths.**   \n\n\nThis is a big pet peeve of mine because I have seen it from many people who are otherwise good at writing... But my god. Sentence variety, paragraph length variety, pacing are all very important in actual writing that you would put out for a commercial audience. Not every sentence has to be thirty words long and a bigger paragraph does not equal better if 90% of the information is inactable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Lots of details of the environment or the clothes but little details of what's going on inside the mind of the character or why they're doing what they're doing.**   \n\n\nI'm not talking about endless monologues or more telling than showing, but when I am reading/writing roleplay, I am more invested in the character. I want to see more of their personality, their reasoning, and their backstory show through even if it's as telling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Too wide of variance in character voice.**  \n\n\n I understand many people write roleplay with a specific goal/plot in mind, but there should be a way to work it out where your character isn't breaking their established character to pursue that goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Difficult characters for the sake of being difficult.**   \nI understand your Mary/Gary Sue/Stu is not like the other girls/boys and she's traumatized, but there's no reason organically that my character would chase yours through forty unrealistic steps when any sane person would stop interacting with them. There's a difference between slow burn and no burn at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Writing your character as doing something hostile/negative and then expecting my character to not have an organic reaction.**   \n\n\nThis ties into my gripes with lots of players. Organic reactions and authenticity in a character are more important to me than flattering your character's ego of you flattering my character's ego. Any circumstance in roleplay can usually became back if your character wants the interaction to continue. If they don't care, you don't care, why are we writing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Preference over heavily plotted and having every detail scripted out over organic roleplay with twists and turns (maybe even surprises thrown in).**  \n\n\n If you wanted a story to go exactly the way you envisioned, write a novel. Otherwise, my character is going to do what is consistent with their character. Not every point of the roleplay has to go off without a hitch and it's more interesting if it doesn't.",

            "selftext": "So, for a little background me and this guy are part of the same group role play on discord (I actually run the server) and up until this point I haven't had the chance to role play with him or check through his responses properly because of differing time zones meaning I don't get to them. \n\nWhat I have noticed a little over time, is that he comes across as...lazy. When setting things up with a partner, he makes them do all the work with little effort, just saying \"idc\" and just having no input whatsoever. \n\nI'll also add in that he's become my new admin after my previous one had to leave due to very personal issues, and I've been having the same lazy issue. When I try to plan events in the server, he has no input, no ideas, not even when it would be the best time for all of us to run it. Nothing.\n\nWith his responses, they run on and offer so little to work with, because all he does is do a basic reaction and offer up some sentence (that runs right on) of what else there is for me to go off of. His dialogue is really bad. And just his overall style just really irks me. \n\nOOC, the guy is awesome. He's super fun to talk to and I really like him, so does everyone else, and it doesn't seem like anyone has problems with his writing since people are still more than happy to do a scene with him. \n\nI'm not sure how to or if I should broach the subject with him, because I really don't want to risk really offending him and possibly losing my admin and I don't want to create problems in the server, so maybe I should just leave it and see if anyone else has problems with his writing?\n\nI just needed to vent and maybe get a little advice from people",

            "selftext": "Rping with men is something that only works out about 50% of the time. The amount of creeps who expect to get close to me outside of rp are insane. Its not all men, I have some lovely guy partners who have been respectful. But it really is like flipping a coin.   \n\n\nMy last rp partner was actually really good! Very literate, loved the plot, did everything right. I told them I didn't mind ooc chatter... and boy oh boy... *big mistake.*   \n\n\nThey talked to me every single hour of the day. I told them I had an exam to study for, they would ask me once every hour \"are you studying?\" and if I said yes, they would say \"good girl.\" they also called me a \"kawaii anime girl\" because of my voice, since we voice called briefly. And said I looked pretty (without knowing what I looked like.) They hit on me very obviously despite knowing I had a boyfriend.   \n\n\nHere are some examples of things they have said:   \n\n\n\"a wittle kawaii desu\"\n\n\"Miss you\" (after telling them I'll be busy studying)\n\n\"Did you get their contact info? With that cute wittle voice of yours OwO \"  \n\n\nThey would also send me different maid outfits to wear and asked if I cosplayed specific characters.   \n\n\nOverall, after telling them that I only like ooc chatter when there is an actual *roleplay* to be *out of character for* and that I would prefer if he roleplayed more often than randomly messaging me throughout the day... he took the trash out himself. Called me a hoe and left the discord server.\n\nNever again will I tell people I like ooc chatter.",

(200 words, 1,000 characters)\n\nThe thing is they take forever to respond and are barely active ooc and honestly, I'm glad that they aren't because I would have probably left sooner. \n\nI can understand taking longer to post when it's longer posts, but when we got started we were pretty rapid pace (few responses a day). I haven't been told of any changes (well once they were pretty active in chatting with me while they were moving but when it comes to just mundane things it's nothing). And they don't communicate the fact they'll be out at all. Recently they were chatting with me said they accidentally didn't post and then disappeared! \n\nPotentially I should just end it. It's been 3 months and I can easily could on two hands how many posts there have been. (Okay maybe 3 hands.)\n\nBut I like what could happen yk?\n\nThen the person with the shorter responses. \nThey do tell me about things ooc that don't have to do with roleplay and it's usually only once in a while. Sometimes they'll message me and also respond to our roleplay. This one is more frustrating because shorter response roleplays.. it takes a bit longer to get through a scene so if I'm waiting forever we're not going to get anywhere. \n\nAnd I've just checked it's been since February that it started and the tavern they started in... They are only just leaving. One night has passed. It's September. Omg. \n\nI don't think it's worth waiting, do you guys? \nI quite like everything about these roleplays and maybe I should just try and communicate, but it's like I don't wanna bother anyone? Yk?

No mention of a writing sample, just an introduction that was difficult to read and I had to reread a few times. To summarize, I asked if they could provide a writing sample anyway, they told me they were disabled and provided one pretty much on the spot. It was about 100 words, every sentence was grammatically incorrect and difficult for me to read. I was admittedly confused by this because the server I'm on is mostly made up of novella and multi-para writers, so I said something on the lines of \"I don't think we'd be a good match, but good luck finding a roleplay partner!\" and they immediately deleted the messages. They said something right before doing so, but I'm not sure what it was. I'd have to assume they weren't happy about it though since they quickly deleted everything. \n\nSince then, I have seen them posting a fair amount of times on the same server. Am I just overthinking things or did I handle this the wrong way?",

We talked ideas, characters, etc. Eventually he told me he'd go work on his own character- and I told em no problem. \n\nThe thing is I wouldn't be so confused about how it's been probably over a day now if it wasn't for them constantly logging on and off, and such. And I know a day isn't much, not at all, I'm not saying it is. I'm saying it's \"alot\" compared to them replying every 5 minutes. And again, it's mostly the fact they're online that's confusing to me.\n\nI have really bad social skills, and cannot for the life of me pick up on clues, so I can't tell if he's busy, just taking a small break, working on his stuff still, etc. \nMaybe I'm being a bitch and acting off for someone taking some time to themselves, but it's really hard for me to know when I should just relax or actually worry. I guess I'm also a little extra paranoid cause I was REALLY excited for roleplay.\n\nWhat do you guys think is going on? Should I just chill or mentally prepare myself for them maybe not being as into it? Please don't be too harsh on me.\n\n[I will delete this eventually, its just a small issue I'm facing rn I figured I'd try to seek some advice on]",
