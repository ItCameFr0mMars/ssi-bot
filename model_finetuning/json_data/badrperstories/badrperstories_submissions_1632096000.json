We both genuinely liked the plot and we were up to each others standards in chat length. 4 posts in, they stop responding.\n\nOkay, maybe they are busy? I wait a couple days for a response in or out of character- nothing.\n\nHm, starting to be odd. I shoot them a message asking if they are still interested in the rp. The next day they respond with a yes, they are just busy with school. \n\nThat was a week ago, and there's still no response in character. Am I being too clingy?",

It's been a couple of years since I last RP'd and I was hoping to get back into it. \n\nHowever, I find the posts on the roleplay subreddits a little overwhelming as they are somewhat... focused on ERP. \n\nDo you have any advice for someone who is starting out on reddit/discord?  What should I avoid? \n\nAlso, are there any art-based RP groups that you know of? (I'm okay with 1-on-1 too) \n\nI apologize in advance if this post seems nit-picky. Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you!",

Someone today annoyed me enough to warrant a little blurb. I'm running a group fandom game right now for Marvel that I'm still recruiting for. Today I posted another round of advertisements promoting and recruiting for said game. \n\nNow in my game it's canons only and states that very clearly on the advertisement. Person messages me and seems interested in joining my little group. I ask them who they want to play and they give a canon. Then ask to talk on Discord. \n\nWe get to Discord and suddenly they want to write a OC person. I remind them that this is a Canon only group (as is stated on the advertisement) they ask why and then before I give an answer unfriend me on Discord. I'm non plussed about losing them but...\n\nDo people not know how to read anymore?",

They really love all my characters for it and the world building, which I find to be really sweet and flattering.  (As it's been a while since I've written actual stories by myself, so having someone be interested in my work, it just makes me happy.)\n\n\nHowever they wanted to make a self insert into the universe and explore the realm. This I was fine with, as my best friend and I have done this with our own writing projects together, growing up. But then they wanted to be best friends with one of the main characters. So I made an OC for myself to help make this work. And in the story the two main characters are both dating, but my friend seems to ignore this. As their self insert is slowly hitting on my one main character, and I make my main character *clearly* uncomfortable. Also, I asked them to maybe make up some other characters, because they also expect me to roleplay, my side character, both of my main characters, and any other supporting characters in the actual canon piece, that I'm writing. \n\n So I would be over here writing about 4 to 12 paragraphs (depending on how much detail I feel like giving and depending on what my other characters are doing), while they write 2 or 3 paragraphs about their \"OC\" doing whatever; but then gets mad if I lessen the amount of detail I post per my replies. However they refuse to make any other characters, because in their words: \"I'm not good at making OCs.\" ((To be honest I don't care if the characters are terribly written and lack detail, just try your best is what I say)).\n\nIf you were in my place, what would you do? They're very sensitive to criticism so if you have a solution, please I am begging you, to let me know aha. \n\n (And if you have any other questions, by all means, please let me know!)",

So I seldom do celeb RPs because most people want them to be ERP rather than a real slow-burn, serious story-thing. But I feel like when I do celeb RPs for guys, I go all out with my research for the celeb I'm writing as. I research her diet, any perfume they're known to wear, fashion, family life, background, watch youtube clips, read a lot of interviews to get into character. And yet there are times I feel like my partner doesn't put in the same effort. I've had the aforementioned partner admit to not putting in the effort I do and it totally took the wind out of my sails. Like who admits that to their partner?\n\nI'm not looking for perfection but some effort would be nice so it doesn't feel like some one-sided affair. I guess I'm just venting because I so seldom do celebrity stuff that I feel like when I do, I keep getting burned. I dunno, it just sucks sometimes haha.\n\nDone venting!",

            "selftext": "So I have a few questions and am asking for advice!  \n\n\nWhen I first start a story, I am very interested and all for it, willing to do whatever. But invariably, there's a disconnect. It might be something that was said OOC, it might be the way the scene turned out, it might be the other person writing where a wrong period put me off the wrong way. I lose interest and making every post gets harder... and harder. And harder.  \n\n\nIt's not really burning out as I might find a new story/play a new idea with someone new and my muse returns like it never left. I've even tried to manage it to the point where there was a conclusive end to one scene and we start a new one (even with the same characters) or starting another story with the same partner but it seems after a while the interest/magic fades from that scene as well.  \n\n\nDo you force yourself through the posts you don't feel like making? (If everything lines up, there's chemistry/ a  pleasant repertoire ooc/ you can't really criticize anything the other writer has done but for some reason, your muse is being resistant?)  \n\n\nI could chalk this up to a fear of missing out, poor self-discipline, or just seeking novelty constantly. But for any like-minded people do you have tips for coaxing your muse when you like the story, you like the writer, you're not burned out completely, still really want to see it further to completion but the writing just will not come for that story?",

            "selftext": "I'm a medieval fantasy RPer and primarily try to RP on discord. It easy for me, allows editing posts, and has useful bots to use when available.\n\nMy main issue is that my own RP goals may be very niche. I like darker fantasy. The kind where characters can die and it makes a plotline more intense and interesting. Like, Game of Thrones levels of war and conflict, but OCs only.\n\nIt's been about two years now and I've skimmed through more than a few servers. I'm older (34), so I only join the ones for adults (18+) that say they have lore or storywork in their ads. This is because adults are better and handling mature, non-sexual themes without being too edgy, IMO.\n\nOr so I thought. As time goes by and I reject more and more possibilities, it's seriously beginning to wear on my patience. I wont fault those with a story that doesnt fit my interests. That's fine. Everything else that I run across is either slice of life, 'romance', or just wierd. When there is a conflict for RP development, I feel like all the other characters are either just OP as holy hell and oneshot everything or theyre so edgy that I could cut myself on it by accident. However, regardless of the RP actions taken, there are no motivations, no emotions, or internalized feelings to understand the other character.  It pretty much kills my mood quickly. It makes everything feel mechanical, like listing off choreographed movements. Nothing is added to environments or settings either. It's like interacting in the matrix or something.\n\nWhen I started this hobby, I was probably a bit happier about it. Covid didn't help. It drove ERP ads off the charts, like shutting the lights off for cockroaches. I dont know. Maybe I'm different or my standards are a bit too high. Maybe I should lower them and do the lewd RPs in exchange for story (sarcasm, hell no.) It just feels like I can't breathe without seeing something sexual related, a shitty mary sue character (dead family is a go-to), or a boring one-liner sipping tea with no other personality being put in (glub glub, like a damned goldfish).\n\nI know that what I want is somewhere out there and that I have to keep looking. I just wanted to stop for a moment and scream into the void by sharing my frustrations of the hobby, aka. the search. Some simplified versions of experiences for people to relate to as well.",

Work's been picking up now that things have gotten back to normal and I've just had no energy to move on with some of the thread's I've picked up over this last year. I feel really bad for letting them for a month or two. \n\nI do my best to keep in contact with my RP partners and let them know what's going on to a degree but I just haven't had the motivation. I hate leaving them waiting despite keeping in contact. The last thing I ever want them to think I'm doing is ghosting. I hate it, we all do. \n\nI just think I may have to take a break or drop a thread or two. I want them to have fun and enjoy the thread but I also don't want to be forcing myself to continue a thread I've lost the drive for, if that makes any sense. It just makes me really sad because I used to carry on so many threads a few years back and could make replies multiple times a day. \n\nAt the end of the day, I've gotta do what's best for me even if it does kinda suck.",

            "selftext": "I gotta vent here because obviously I can't tell my partners about this and I can't tell my non-RP friends either cos they don't even know what RP is. \n\nOccasionally you get that perfect partner whose writing is exactly what you need and are on the same track as you, want the same things, etc. So when they're gone it's like this big black hole. I've been trying to fill it for a year+ by now, and though I've etched out a good niche in some forum RPs, and am having some good fun, I still feel frustrated at times. Their posts always fall a little bit short of being completely fulfilling. The dialogue is just ok, their characters are made to fill roles rather than being fully-fleshed out characters with goals and desires, they don't add any detail besides what is happening right in that moment...like, tell me about what your character was doing before. Add some of your own detail, your own flair, into the scene. All I get is like a response to what my character said and then MAYBE some comment on the setting if I'm lucky.\n\nI usually have to lead the threads along, too, because if I don't, the characters will likely just be standing there getting nothing done and talking endlessly. \n\nI love RP but it's like eating a lot of junk food. I am craving that partner that really wants to go deep-diving into character motivations. I want something more than a response, I want something that is harmonizing. And most of all I don't feel challenged. And that makes me feel bored, and when I get bored I feel frustrated (as mentioned before), even resentful for the perceived energy I'm inputting vs what I'm getting as output. I feel taken advantage of, even, which I know, logically, is not what's happening here. \n\nI've also had many attempts to find partners, trawled through all sorts of ads through livejournal, jcink, discord, etc., with no results. I'm starting to feel like it's a hopeless cause. And maybe my standards have just climbed too high at this point. But I also just love RP too much to give it up.\n\nIk if I express this sentiment I might get a lot of \"just write a book\" (which I am LOL) but it's not quite the same. Part of why I like RP so much is the collaboration and the anticipation of a partner's response, which is unknown to you.",

The lack of planning is killing me, I hate leaving things to fate or whatever. Planning maintains my excitement in the story. \n\nMoreover, it\u2019s also an ERP and since the start she stated that she agreed with me that it shouldn\u2019t be the main plot. However all that happens now is ERP. It\u2019s so frustrating! \n\nAt first I also didn\u2019t love her writing but I was like: I\u2019ll try. Well I did and I reached the conclusion don\u2019t like it. \n\nHowever I feel like I let this drag on for too long and now I feel bad because she\u2019s a very good person and the OOC is nice. \n\nI guess I\u2019m mostly looking to vent and for some support because I HATE ending RP\u2019s when everything seems just fine.",

            "selftext": "Me again asking for advice. So i'm pretty new to roleplaying (less than one year actually) and I seem to have come across a \"trend\" of some sorts. Basically I've seen a lot of screenshots of male roleplayers who just harass women for NSFW RP which obviously IS NOT OK. The thing is I've seen lots of comments of people not wanting to RP with males for this very reason which is totally understandable but obviously it's something that makes me incompatible with lots of roleplayers. Specially because they ask for gender and i'm honest about being a straight male. I actually had some people reject me for being a male, in the most polite way possible so there was no hard feelings at all, but it obviously stings a little specially because it isn't something I did. I just don't know what to do, I considered telling people i'm a woman but I don't want to lie to my partners, it just feels sneaky you know? (Yes, sneaky actions seem to be a trend with me)",

It is no longer a collection of stories about bad roleplayers, but a collection of gripes written BY bad roleplayers. YOU have to use your brain just a little when you select your partner. Each person needs to clearly define exactly what they are looking for in terms of posting frequency, content, post length, tense, and literacy level *before* the roleplay starts. If the other person cannot demonstrate that they are an intelligent writer with decent communication skills before starting, DON'T RP with them, and START IGNORING people who throw up red flags in the first conversation.\n\nFor those of you who are going to bitch about the fact that you can do everything right and still have an RP fizzle: Yes, I'm aware.

At around 4:55pm we start the RP after like two hours of set up essentially. I type a long paragraph which yeah didn't have the best grammar I get it I used too many I's which I thought actually wasn't and it really wasn't many I's for a first person type of opener I think that there was a fair number of them. However, I can fix that so I did and she wasn't happy still so I tried to keep compressing. We spent 20 minutes fixing my opener to her liking, she wanted it to be more shorter,have more interaction. And at this point I'm like losing my mind cause I never had to deal with a person this picky but I still push through cause I give her the benefit of the doubt maybe I am an idiot and I just don't know how to do this, I'm sort of new so that's what I thought. I erased everything I had and started fresh, it worked, and we went smoothly for one exchange until it was my turn. Once I wrote the bit which was a pretty long bit because I had no other choice given the circumstance it had to be long. But I decide to do an action that involves her character \"sort of catching me in an act\" and she goes and says something along the lines of \"no my character isn't going to do that\". I reply with \"k then lol\" . I fix the bit( my character now is entering the house of another character), she says no don't enter the house yet. And at this point I'm losing my shit. I am just about to tell her like \"yo, if you are this picky nobody is going to want to rp with you\" I have never been so patient and angry at the same time in my life I felt like if anyone else touched me or said anything I was going to explode mentally but calmly.  If she keeps doing what she wants I'm just going to end up telling her that maybe this erp relationship isn't going to work and just call it a day. Like I'm trying to masturbate and when I get into it I just get interrupted by, \"no my character isn't going to approach the car (is what she ultimately said). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe erp still continues as I am typing this but man I felt like I had to rant . Everything seems to go smoothly now maybe I overreacted? I don't even know I'm just going to keep riding along until I get another red flag of some sorts I guess. The ERP world is definitely a weird place.",

My apologies in advance...\\]\n\n**I'd like to make it abundantly clear that NO NUDES OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTS WERE EXCHANGED. WE ONLY DID 1 ERP BY MISTAKE.**\n\nhi all,\n\nsorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but i am kind of.. freaking out. and feeling horribly awful about the situation. this happened last year and has been plagueing me since, and whilst lurking in an active chat where people were condemning rpers who rped with minors triggered an intense anxious reaction in me, triggering me into posting this. I just need to get this out there and ask for advice. it does contain.. bad rp of sorts. just the individual i rp'ed with being.. a bad rper, not a bad person at all though, and me being a bad rper for having insanely bad rp etiquette.. (also, **writing this post badly intentionally** and gramatically bad to make sure people dont recognize me online, so please bear with me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**joined the wrong server (like an inexperienced dumbass)**\n\nso being the dumbass i am, im looking for some erp in a discord server (this is where my first mistake was, the server wasn't strictly an 18+ server, plus age verification and roles was not implemented when i joined. should've known better, but i'm a fucking dumbass who didnt know how this shit worked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**first contact with said individual &amp; my inexperience with setting up rp with strangers**\n\nnot soon after i joined, i get hit up by an individual, a moderator of sorts in the server. and they're super nice to me as well! and our interests align pretty well too, maybe not all but i felt comforted making some sort of connection in my sheer depressive and desperate state during the covid lockdown so hey i'll settle for anything, maybe even to just get a friend out of it to ease my loneliness (not justifying the act, just my emotional state). the person is, however.. simple to communicate with, and easily excited. (people like that are not uncommon for the community im in i guess, considering its a very nice and accepting &amp; weird community, but I should've seen that as a red flag)\n\nand we talked about just setting up an rp, sharing characters, ideas.. etc. **and i never fucking asked for their age before beginning**, because i'm not used to the etiquette of rping with strangers because i always only rped with friends who i knew were of age and playing characters of age was just a given, so asking for their age didn't occur to me at all even though i really should've known to do so...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**the accident**\n\nso we do some rp, this rp contained, a weird fetish of sorts, some see it as a comfort thing, some dont. i think of it as erotic. the other.. might've not? i don't know.. but the individual specifically requested no sexual intercourse acts in the rp, which we didn't. it's going.. all right. i'm writing long and detailed paragraphs (about 3-5), i get consistently short replies back that do not add anything to the rp. Just.. reacting. not spicing it up by taking over or flowing the rp in a certain interesting direction (strike number four. should've seen this coming if the replies were this short and... simple. but at this point im so desperate i'd take anything). dude compliments me and is in awe at my writing form (which was nice of him to say, but that should've been another fucking hint that i didnt fucking pick up on). eventually, we cut the rp short, because i had to go to bed to get up early &amp; timezones, you know the drill..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**post nut clarity**\n\nit was kind of after this short one-off rp when i was lying in bed and with some good 'ol post nut clarity that the few braincells in my brain started churning and throughout the week, I started being suspicous of this individuals age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**the way i found out**\n\nlater in the week, he hits me up again. ''great one-off'' he said, and ''hey you mentioned you wanted to be more submissive right? i can do that for you even though i rarely do''. that was sweet since i did mention wanting to be more submissive, but at this point i was just too scared, very carefully navigating the conversation and picking up on hints, reviewing some past chat messages here and there too.\n\nso, i had the idea to set him up by acting as if i was interested, and ultimately giving the question ''hey, a college scenario might be fun, got any experience in that?'' because hey if i can get info what year of college he is in out of him, i can surely determine his age right? \n\nhe said he didn't have college experience.\n\ni dipped away from discord for that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**how i dealt with it after finding out their age**\n\nI gently rejected the rp proposals he gave me after the accident by either ignoring him or sometimes engaging in small, surface level conversations, because at the same time, i just felt absolutely horrible for ignoring this dude. he did seem to be clingy, depressed and going through some shit, but super, super nice and sweet as well, i just felt awful ignoring him because i just didn't know how the fuck to proceed anymore. sometimes i gave in out of guilt and said hi again and checked in on him, where he just grew excited saying ''i was sad but im good now that you're here.''\n\nAfter some months, the discord server got taken over by a new owner, and age-tags were given in the server. the individual had the age tag 15-17.\n\nit eventually got to the point where we are now at the point that he's responding pissed at me (which is, understandable, considering my assholish ghostish behaviour towards him. i'd be pissed getting ghosted too so i dont blame him.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'd like to make it abundantly clear that NO NUDES OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTS WERE EXCHANGED. WE ONLY DID 1 ERP BY MISTAKE.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**moving forward**\n\nI've learned from my mistakes and will strictly check ages upon rping in the near future (even though i've been completely avoiding doing so because im feeling guilty), and being much, much pickier with partners in the near future too.\n\njust realized i've been a fucking dipshit for leading them on too whilst writing this, by not just cutting contact and saying no. i'm a fucking irredeemable ass. i guess i do owe them an explanation, but at the same time, i dont want to stir up drama and have him start a witch hunt on me or shit.. community's known for getting into drama sometimes, and since it's a minor.. it's hard to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**main question/how can i prevent further mishaps?**\n\nSo my question is; should I feel guilty at all about this? how do i not hurt their feelings anymore? (even though i think that might be too late now). how do i move the fuck on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**are there other measures i can take to protect myself and others from getting hurt and stuff like this happening again?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...I should've been in bed an hour ago, debating whether to even post this fucking mess. I'm just doing it and going to bed, hopefully being able to sleep and distracting myself from this, so if i dont reply, you'll know why. responses might be very late, but please feel free to leave advice (or condemnation) in the comments below.",

            "selftext": "Oh , oh this might actually work here. We didn't even GET to roleplaying or plotting. They  approached me from an ad from discord where I was looking for a partner. \n\nSo,  anyone can check my history my latest type of posts for writing have been geared towards medieval fantasy with a gdoc link to the trope I've been searching for, with a semi detailed way of how I'd like the initial intros to go. I post them on reddit and a few Discord servers that are specific for partner searching and I try to be thorough so anyone searching knows what I'm looking for...I still manage to get a few that slip through the cracks..\n\nSo, this person messages me about a month ago...I asked from between the prompts in my gdocs which is in all my ads which one they might be interested in. They say they didn't see it so I link them (red flag 1)..... I send them the link and they said they didn't understand the prompts and asked if I could rephrase over 1100 words which is literally an intro post setting the scene and explaining the setting and the direction (red flag 2)....I told them it was difficult to do that but did a very *very* basic few sentence breakdown... The response..\n\nThem: \"Oh I'm more into toys and humans, tbh.\"\n\nThem: \"Like these ones, and you being a mom or a big sister.\" (red flag 3?)\n\n*-They proceed to send me a picture of the soldiers from Small soldiers, the 90's film-* (ya'll if I had a camera and could have screenshot my face...)\n\nMe: \"Omg haha haven't seen that movie in years\n\nbut it's not really my thing\"\n\nThem: \"Owwwwwww really?\" *super sad*\n\nThey then try to convince me to rp it with them after explaining it was one of their favorite films with their mom as a kid. \n\n  I say I'm good, that it's not what I'm looking for. That I'm looking for medieval fantasy soulmate/romance/drama type stuff.\n\n*-I get a frowny face followed by the gif of the scene of the bald barbies tying up Kirsten Dunst's character with the cables and being gagged in the film.-* This was followed by..\n\nThem: \"We can put some romance here XD\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell them again I'm not interested. Mentally I'm in hysterics processing that this is happening while slightly weirded out and ask if there was something they could do to convince me.\n\nI explain that if I'm not into the prompt I won't get far past an intro because the rp then feels like a chore.\n\nThey asked if I would want to do something modern then or only medieval stuff. I explained that I've done futuristic and modern things for years and this has been my stretch of only wanting medieval. \n\nThem: \"So no?\" -*insert frowny smiley-*\n\nI tell them I'll have to pass and that I hope they find someone for the rp since they really want it...\n\nI thought this is where we were done talking...over 20 minutes pass and I'm still chuckling over it. My discord goes off again...\n\n\"I would love you to be someone like this\"\n\n*-They then proceed to send an image of a pretty blonde in probably her mid twenties to late twenties in a pink satin short robe. The next image is of another blonde with her back to the camera in a thong bikini showing her cheeks -* ..It could have been the same woman, I'm not sure....\n\nI'm baffled at this point and tripped out a little but still laughing..\n\nI tell them that it's not my usual character type but to make it kind of funny I add that she does have a nice ass though to make it less harsh.\n\nThe response.....ya'll..the *response*..\n\n\"*nodding* she was my babsitter irl!\n\nWhen I was like 13!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't even.....",

I just wish they\u2019d knock it off since it seriously throws the vibe off (imo) for an overall serious rp scenario. \n\nWhat do you guys think? And if I should say something, how should I approach it?",

I understand fully that if a server isn\u2019t your thing or your not having fun with it, that you should leave it. I\u2019m not offended by that. If it\u2019s not your thing I get it.\nWhat I don\u2019t understand are people who stick around until the smallest thing bothers them than just leave without asking about it first.\nMainly I\u2019m talking about the most recent incident for me. Ive come to realize that my role playing  method isn\u2019t what most people are used to. I prefer to have all the rp go down in one channel than make another one after that one has run it\u2019s course, meaning it\u2019s a bit confusing at the start but tends to smooth out once everyone has found who they are interacting with.\nUpon releasing the first rp I quickly realized most people don\u2019t like it this way, so I tried to fix it a bit by making it that if you start a scene with someone you can make a thread in the discord channel. I figured it was the best of both worlds, a bit more organized but still way more free feeling.  But while i was in the process of fixing all of it a person messaged saying it\u2019s too chaotic for them and just straight up left the server without another word.\nLike I\u2019m IN THE MIDDLE OF FIXING IT! What confused me even more is it was a person who had been patiently waiting for the rp to be built up and begin for at least a week or two, and seemed genuinely interested in it. But right when the first problem shows up they leave.\n\nWhat confuses me most about this is that I am more than willing to communicate. If there is an issue tell me about it and i will try to fix it. If I can\u2019t than I will ask the others for their thoughts on the matter and try to find the best solution for all of us. If after that you still arnt happy than I fully understand wanting to leave .\nBut they didn\u2019t even give me a second to respond. It was just a quick thing about it being too chaotic than they left the server.\n\nNow I\u2019m just kinda sitting here wondering if I did something wrong? I\u2019m still kinda  new to roleplaying in discord. Most of my experience came from Instagram but I\u2019m doing my best to figure it all out as I go.",

Though something has come up that I have been struggling with. A character of theirs who I would describe as more of a punk/pretty faced anime guy archetype sought one of my characters who is a NB appearance based design. I have established how my character was from the beginning and they hit it off very well. Their character actively b-lined for mine romantically. They had a cute dynamic where I enjoyed the contrast of them.\n\nAfter the ship was more established something a bit confusing came up. Their character had turned less into who they once were and now has also kind of come out as fluid with their gender as well and now is portraying more like a 'shy boy cutesie type.' I really have been accepting of the change but with it has come some things that make me uncomfortable. Plus the character is starting to feel like a different person too. My partner has also consistently given me the impression that they want my character to be more of the handsome princely type of guy which was not exactly what I had in mind for my character when designing them. Especially since I usually design more of that character as my usual when roleplaying since it is highly sought after. Almost as if the roles are now being reversed. I do have other characters we roleplay so I don't see why there is a sudden desire for this particular pairing to be changed up but it does not sit well with me. They also have used more slightly offensive terms to describe our characters lately and it has been rubbing the wrong way but usually when I try to converse with them about it they say their character loves mine and doesn't want him to change. Yet in roleplay the thoughts and words of the character don't exactly match with what the mun is telling me.",

Fine, I ignore it and try to be jovial about the potential for a new roleplay. Some people are just shy. She replies with one-worded answers, pushes all of the decision making on me, her character sounds like a Mary Sue\u2019s wet dream and the entire plot seems to surround her character.

I'm in a roleplay group, and other people want my OC to get with theirs too. I don't want to rush this sort of thing, mostly because I'm not very interested in the idea of romance. This is both of the characters' first encounter, and while I'm okay with them being friends, I don't want my character to immediately be romantically involved with someone.  \nI know that \"love at first sight\" stuff is probably possible, but I don't really want to do that with my OC. I think I'm being a rude person for having to reject them, since I had to do it while the rest of the people in my group were there and the person took it kind of hard. I feel like I also put off the rest of the group. I said I was open to romance, but that it would probably take some time because I want to develop it slowly--mostly because I feel that my character wouldn't handle romance well without some time for development.  \nI just don't want to rush it, but people support our characters getting together even if I have stated that I don't feel like it. I don't want to be at fault for someone's sadness, but I don't want to give in and put my character in a romance I'm not interested in. Would it be wrong to say that I just don't want to? I feel like if I tried to pursue a romance with a separate character at a later time (once I've gotten relations between other characters and development established), then I'd be hypocritical. I'm not completely put off by romance, but I'm just not interested in it at the moment. I've stated several times that I want to be told if someone plans to start a romance with my character if they wanted my character to return the feelings, but I don't know if that's too harsh.   \nI feel like I let people down since others want me to go with it, and the person sulked even if I hadn't technically turned down the idea of a romance. I just said I wasn't up for it at this time.",

To begin with. Then I started to notice that he was definitely more reactive and liked to fill the space with senseless and purely reactive dialogue rather than add anything or push the scene along, leaning it all to me. Once I noticed that I started noticing more stuff. \n\nAt this point none of it was was massive deal, I was still enjoying myself and everything was fine. And then, I switched to a different character for a certain scene, where I was playing a zombie girl who was going to lure his character, I'll call him Jim, into a safe house where my character had just eaten everyone who was inside. \n\nAnyway, fast forward a little, I'm setting it up that who I'll call Lib was going to bite Jim, which was what we had discussed was going to set up for the scene, and he continually deflected it. \n\nWhen Katie finally bit him, I have an entire two paragraphs describing the different things that were happening: slowly going up to his neck as if she was going to kiss it, and then describing when Katie ripped a chunk of his skin off. \n\nAnd then what does he say?\n\n'Blah blah blah, Jim pushed the girl away awkwardly when she started coming closer, slightly nervous.' Bro. So, he made me do the entire thing THREE TIMES before he accepted it. Dude?\n\nHe did stuff along those lines at least 3 more times in different scenes and circumstances if it....I'm not even Waite what anymore. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on his character and the way he was written. He was the one and only person that could save humanity (ok sure, I can accept that, sorta makes sense?), and treats everyone around him as less and and refuses to be 'bested' by anyone. \n\nNeedless to say, I dropped that role play because he was getting very very annoying and I was sick of it really frustrated.",

Even if I previously enjoyed roleplaying with you and you writing was good, doing something like that makes me immediately lose any trust for you from this point onwards. Why do people even do this? I don't know. Particularly so in MMOs where you can do an alt check-up very easily to figure out two characters are on the same account. Had it both happen to folk whose offers to RP I declined and people I already played with. While the former case sort of makes sense to me since they'd want to give it another go, I seriously cannot get the logic behind doing the same thing when we did stuff with your other character, I enjoyed it, and would've said 'yes' to another scene without hesitation if poked from that character or even told it's the same person.",

            "selftext": "The last person I rped with was a woman who would more or less demand my character assault hers even though I tried to make it painfully very clear I didn't want him to. The story wasn't even supposed to go in that direction at all since we'd discussed it was going to be a relatively slow burning romance (it was her idea in the first place too when she'd initially approached me with her pitch) so it sorta surprised me that she'd even suggested it in the first place.\n\nShe would get passive aggressive with me when I didn't answer right away even after I told her I would be busy. It was like she expected me to be available all day every day. It also felt like she controlled my character's actions at times which is something I did not appreciate. Then she got awfully defensive when I pointed it out. And the worst part was that often times she would post one-liners even though she stated herself that she strictly wrote multi-paragraphs and required her partner to do the same.\n\nI asked if we could do some paranormal RP and she refused which was fine, but later she said she wanted to do one about demons and angels or something lol. There was one where I played some demon pretending to be a priest or clergyman and lured her character (a demon hunter) into some elaborate trap. And when he caught him she basically just went \"Oh hell yeah! Now can he enslave and r\\*pe him!?\" Even though I didn't want it to go down that way since my character was planned to be hetero as hell and was actually engaged to some demon lady. But in the end I just sorta went along with it anyway lol. I regret it so bad!\n\nI told her off once after she complained about my slow responses and lack of enthusiasm to continue. But all she wanted to do was have our characters have sex like every other paragraph. When all I wanted to do was play some villain and cause chaos and discord throughout the lands and not enslave some random hunter and keep him as a sex toy. She even made him enjoy it and demand him to do more sex things with him but I wasn't feeling it so I just had the demon guy go \"Well, see ya never!\" And just went off, presumably to marry the hot demon chick he'd met off-screen.\n\nAnyway after I told her off she disagreed with everything I said and denied my point of view saying everything was fine on her end (yeah sure good for you) and asked if we could continue. I think I said no and she blocked me not long afterwards lol.\n\nI found her a year later on an alt account and sent her a message asking if she still RPs. I don't know why I guess just mainly to see if she would recognise me. (She didn't.) But she eventually blocked me there too because I guess I wasn't quick enough to respond lol oh well.\n\nThere was another one who would describe her character doing everything 'cutely' it was annoying as hell but I kept quiet about it. She eventually ended the RP in a weird way (well she just looked at my reply then put a thumbs up emoji and never replied again...) and I saw her posting on someone else's ad like a minute later lol.\n\nThe longest one I had was alright but she annoyed me with her lack of understanding of English when she for some reason answered an English speaker's post. I mean her English was decent enough but it got weird when she tried to describe certain scenarios and she'd use a mixture of English and what I assume to be Portuguese. And she asked if I wanted to do an RP of some popular anime at the time when I clearly stated in my ad that I wanted to do an RP with an original world and characters. I tried to compromise by using anime-esque characters (I used to draw a bit back then so I drew her and my characters in an anime style and this seemed to please her) even though I'm not really into anime all that much lol. I could barely understand what she was saying most of the time but she was very sweet in our ooc chats and we ended up becoming friends before she eventually ghosted me after a little over two years lol.\n\nThere was this one guy who wanted my character to have sex with his immediately (like they just talked about their feelings to each other then ***bam*** he jumps her and they have sex LOL) which wasn't what we'd discussed initially. Like sure we'd agreed that it would eventually lead to that somewhere down the road but it just sort of came out of nowhere and made me laugh a little bit. He too eventually ghosted me after he bragged to me about getting a girlfriend irl or something. Oh well good for him I guess. I mean I can't even be upset about it. Bro is living his life and that's just awesome!\n\nThere was some boy who wanted to do a romance RP even though I did not say I was willing to do romance in that particular RP ad he responded to. I stated I wanted to do something paranormal and he asked if we could make it a romance. I was reluctant but I said I'd consider it later down the road if the characters seemed compatible. On my ad I stated that I was strictly looking for 18+ partners. I looked at his bio ( this was back when skype was pretty prominent) and it said he was 15 freaking years old...... I called him out on it and he said something like he didn't think it was important to mention initially. Like wtf you want to rp romance with me? An adult? Why don't you just find someone your own age?? Then he said I was making a big deal out of it and started talking about how he was right and he knew he was right and I just went *okay that's good for you I guess* and just blocked his little ass.\n\nI actually ended up killing one RP with this awesome lady after I was being threatened by some family members to clear house. That was stressful as hell! I remember her being so understanding about it too which was amazing and she'd even told me to RP with her anytime after everything became stable again. By the time I sorted out the mess, it'd already been over a year or so that had passed so I never bothered to shoot her that email I'd been meaning to. For some reason I thought it'd be awkward after all that time but now I sort of really regret not doing it.\n\nThen there was this Zombie Apocalypse one and I just hated my partner's character... but dammit our main characters were in an established relationship with each other... I didn't want it but they seemed interested in playing it out that way. Thing is their writing was amazing, all nice, neat and detailed. But their character (I'll refer to him as **K**) was just impulsive, loud and annoying. He'd throw punches at my supporting characters for little to no reason and kept announcing to everyone how gay he was. Like, dude... is that gonna be your only personality trait or something that you're angry, enjoy punching people out and are homosexual? Then again the angry and impulsive stuff arguably fits considering the current situation they were placed in maybe? But like he'd done it when they'd found some safe place with many survivors-- survivors who had food and resources they were willing to share with the MCs... And then -***bam-*** **K** just punches out some dude because he didn't like this one particular thing he said to him, forcing the characters to flee. I think I just made my character ( **J** ) get bit by a zombie in a skirmish and he told **K** to leave him alone and get out lol (I guess I'd rather him die than end up with the dude for any longer) but they just had **K** rescue **J** somehow.\n\nAfter he survived somehow, I later had **J** flirt with some girl he had paired with for a mission and he also kept a stash of hetero pornography round him. I don't think he was bi or anything but he just liked breasts or something lol. I dunno what I was thinking but I just thought it'd be funny for him to appreciate the female body even if he wouldn't end up with one. I mentioned this with them during our initial ooc chat but they didn't seem to comment much about it so I assumed they were fine with it or something. Oddly enough that was the only memorable thing I remember about my character other than he liked sandwiches apparently and I mean he *really* liked them. That was the main reason why he was pissed at **K** for getting them kicked out of the safe group if I recall; the motherfucker was in the middle of stuffing his face with a sandwich and had to stop eating in order to help his partner out after the fight broke out.\n\nAt some point **K** was mad about something **J** did or said. **K** then proceeded to threaten to smash **J**'s head open with a bat he'd found back at the academy/college they'd escaped from. And not long after that they had sex for some arbitrary reason... I'm pretty sure I didn't want to do it either since it felt so unearned but whatever I apparently went along with it anyway.\n\nAnyway... Long story short they ended up ghosting me at some point.\n\nI dunno I don't have anything against anyone I RPed with (aside from that 15 year old pillock!) but I just found it funny how they inevitably ghosted or blocked me at some point when the RP derailed. Er except for that one where I just straight up ended things on my own that is. Haven't RPed in a while and I sorta miss it too!\n\nTldr; uhhh... I don't know if I can sum this post up but I got a question for whoever read this: do you feel the need to state whether you're a man or woman when setting up ads for your rps? Oddly enough I never felt the need to do it.",

            "selftext": "So I was browsing a lewd wrestling subreddit and I saw someone posting for a rape rp. At first I thought \u201cok. Weird request but whatever floats your boat, mate\u201d but then I go into the comments and see a guy, let\u2019s call him Bob, insulting him and saying he\u2019s disgusting for this request and claiming he likes actual rape cause he wanted a rape rp. I thought \u201cok mate. Bit harsh but whatever\u201d so I replied to him basically saying \u201chey mate, chill. Just cause he requested a rape rp doesn\u2019t mean he actually likes rape\u201d and then Bob over here starts attacking me for it and so I choose to dm him\n\nSo I pmed Bob and basically told him that because op was asking for a rape rp doesn\u2019t mean he actually enjoys real rape and I can say that as I have rped rape with others who don\u2019t like real rape but Bob here sticks to his guts and basically tells me that cause I rped rape I enjoy rape which I don\u2019t. I hate irl rape in every form, hell I got creeped out by THAT scene in fucking goblin slayer so yeah. But nope. According to Bob, I like real rape apparently. So then I decide to share actual evidence of a person who likes rp rape but not real rape and how does Bob respond? By acting sarcastic likes he\u2019s 12.\n\nNow it\u2019s worth pointing out that the op of the rape rp request was acting childish too as he was telling Bob to suck his dick and stuff but this was no better than that and I eventually just gave up\n\nSo yeah. That happened..and I dunno how to feel about it. Was I right? Was I wrong? I\u2019ll let you decide that one.",

            "selftext": "Just felt the need to get this off my chest, because it has admittedly been frustrating me a bit and this feels like a place I can semi-anonymously rant about it. So, I'm apart of a small community that's been on a slow decline for a while now and there's a lot more ghosting than there should be given how small it is \u2014 but since summer has ended, there's been absolutely nothing remotely interesting going on. It's more or less the same people...advertising their ideas, except nobody is actually responding. And just to clarify, this isn't a me issue because past partners I've roleplayed with have also been complaining about how lackluster the community is, except no one talks about it publicly for all eyes to see.\n\nWhat's more or less going on is, people advertise their roleplay... maybe 2 people respond out of x number requests, but eventually those two people also disappear for a prolonged amount of time. Either due to college being back in session or because they have a short attention span (it's usually one or the other, if not leaning more towards college since summer is over). If they haven't forgotten by the time they come back, the creator has already lost interest or kicked them out. Then it's rinse and repeat. It's like there's barely any actual roleplaying going on and it feels like some people are just joining roleplays because in the moment they're bored. You could have 20 people want to roleplay with you, but only 2 or 3 of them actually even get into the plotting stage.\n\nFor me personally, I can endure waiting really long *if* I've roleplayed with you at least once before and I don't have to remind you constantly since I'm socially anxious and I just hate pestering my partners, but dang these people... I don't know how to describe it in all honesty? I want to see if things will get better when the holidays comes around, but the way things have gotten is just really bad. \n\nI've been waiting for people to respond so I can just get to the stage of actually talking about the concept of a roleplay. I really want to go ahead and start a roleplay with someone else, but if they do the same thing? I just don't wanna overwhelm myself or anything if by chance they all decide to come back around when they aren't busy.",

You then receive badly-written porn as a response.\n\n**The needy-poker**\n\nThis person doesn't understand you might be doing things outside of RP and will poke you with several 'what's up? or '?' messages in rapid succession if you do not reply quickly to their response to your ad. Almost guaranteed to behave the same way IC\n\n**What are boundaries?**\n\nYou send this person a list of your likes/dislikes and things you won't RP at all. They immediately respond with something on your no-go list. They then act confused why you don't want to RP with them. They may even come back later on after you've posted another ad, and then act surprised when you \\*still\\* don't want to RP with them, even though the prompt has changed.\n\n**I know you posted about &lt;topic&gt; but...**\n\nSemi-related to what are boundaries. This person replies to your ad with something similar to what you posted, but still disregarding your listed preferences. Usually consisting of a different pairing/different MC than what you listed.

Life happens, people realize that someone isn't a good fit and don't want to go \"Hey, sorry, we won't work\" for whatever reason. And they don't have to share those reasons. Maybe they don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Or maybe they don't want to deal with the potential temper tantrum that could follow. Or maybe they wound up in the hospital, their computer died, they got a new job, or fell into a spiral of depression. You don't know and you don't need to. Someone vanishing online from their hobby doesn't mean they're bad. It means they can't write with you right now for whatever reason.\n\n**Preferring a gender does not equal bad RP.**\n\nSometimes people have preferences for the gender of the person they RP with. That's okay. They have their reasons. And they don't have to share them. Maybe they have a history of trauma. Maybe they just find a specific gender meshes with them better. Maybe they want a specific gender in hopes that they can seduce them OOC. Their reasons, ridiculous or not, are their own. And it isn't bad of them to have them. \n\n**Having boundaries does not equal bad RP.**\n\nPreferring a certain type of RP, or a certain type of communication or a specific age range does not equal bad RP. Having boundaries is healthy. Knowing what you want and what you expect from a partner is *good*. Being upfront with these boundaries is even better. It keeps anyone from getting too invested only to be blindsided by incompatibility. \n\n**Liking ERP does not equal bad RP.**\n\nWhat people enjoy is their own. If someone only ERPs, that's on them. It isn't your problem, if you don't like it, don't write with them. Simple as that.",
