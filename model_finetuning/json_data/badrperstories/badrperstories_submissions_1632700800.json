I started things off with 5 solid paragraphs that took me nearly a half hour to write. I was ready for something good in response. \n\nAnd I get 4 lines. I did specify I was looking for a literate partner, but, to my fault, I never specified any requirement for length. After all, I don't particularly mind short responses as long as they're quality and move things forward. But what I got was full of typos and not particularly well written. \n\nBut I absolutely adore this idea. Is there anything I should do for this? I want to continue things, but I've had the same pattern happen with roleplayers like this. Even if I enjoy the rp, their replies give me little go off of and it fizzles out.",

Some common things include:  \n\n\n\\-My expectation for communication. I don't expect my partners to live online but I do drop RPs if I post a starter and don't hear from them again for a week. Someone got very, very upset with me about this then began insulting my OCs when I pointed out it was in my doc.  \n\n\n\\-My off-limits topics Two (2) separate people have demanded things on my list of things I won't write about, well after we'd started RPing.

            "selftext": "Hi! I've been in the Rp hobby for many many years. Partners come and go yet I've had a small handful of people who I'm still close with in the hobby. Which is why I'm asking what do I do know. To preface this, I'm not 100 innocent. Plus these are topics mentioning SH and Unaliving ones self. \n\nTo start, I met this person while doing my usual Reddit Ads and wanting to RP a old character that I want to breathe life into. I'm going to call this person K. \n\nI met K 2 and half months ago and wanted to do an RP. Things were great! They are great at reply lengths, HCs and recommended me some movies to watch. All was well. Till my IRL job decided to be a bag of dicks and I mentioned I wanted a break. K was fine with it and we got to chatting and HC things. I mentioned how my day was as did they. I even told them I have a Boyfriend IRL and they seem to take it ok. Even mentions getting things to help my boyfriend out in his hobby that K also does....to which I might ad K is in another country. \n\nNow later on in the month I mention I'm ok to RP again, but they aren't. No big deal. We just HC and chat... but heres the concerning bit. It's become very clear that K is Lonely. Relationship wise and friends wise. I try my best to help as one does over a screen: by letting them vent, sending them funny videos, drawings I've done. No big deal. \nBut theyve made some very disparaging remarks how once they send out their gifts, theyre going to... Unalive themselves. Things like that. Of course I worry and I try to give them advice as much as I can. As I also suffer from depression and Suicide and I feel bad. \nBut lately that's what the situation has developed into. Their work life is miserable. Family life. Love life...but how I'm the only positive thing they have going for them. I never for once pressured them to RP and had mentioned a AU in the past instead of the main plot... but that went unanswered. If anything I've expressed my thoughts to have them seek professional help as they really need it.... you can tell where this is going \n\nSo this is where I may be a dick. I post a RP search ad, but I'm not gonna advertise the character I have for that plot I have with them. I have other Ocs. I harmlessly posted to them in a joking way about this asshole responding to an ad. And things just went downhill. \nThey got real quiet, saying how they're going to log off and how apparently their feelings dont matter anymore. To which I ask if anything's wrong? \nBack and forth until they tell me that I WAS the only person to ask how they were doing in life. Their work sucks as is their other relationships. And that I was searching to replace them and that people only care about themselves. To which I say its not true.\n\n I've been searching for RPs outside. Yes. And I apologized for it. But never searching for the plots similar to ours or the characters from it. That I would never replace him as a person and that he needs help and that I'm here if he needs me..\nPeople of Reddit. What do I do?",

We hit it off started talking a lot etc. We set up our discord server, set up the characters, paired them up, and even sent starters. Well I was talking to this person this morning and we were getting along great. I closed the server convo down since I was going to another and I came back and this b**** left the server, unfriended me and blocked me! No context, no \u2018I\u2019m sorry I have to leave\u2019 no nothing! So I create a throwaway account just to see what the actual h**** is wrong is this person and I was asking why they left and what kind of person they were for doing that and their response was \u2018the same kind of person who will block a throwaway account because you don\u2019t take a hint\u2019.

            "selftext": "\nGetting too personal!?\n\nAfter reading much of the posts in the sub, I felt compelled to share my experience also. I am not sure what to call it as, I will leave it for you to decide.\n\nI posted my first prompt, and like the patient guy with the fishing rod and line, I waited for any \u2018 fish \u2018 to take my bait. It was a M4F flair, and I did not expect much responses also. Reason being, it was \u2018 vanilla \u2018 as mentioned to me by the user about whom I am stating. A simple slice of life storyline with smut thrown here and there.\n\nThe user pinged me and we started our chat. Once pleasantries were exchanged, we decided to go on a platform for further discussion. User suggested KIK, so I had to install it and hastily create an ID.\n\nWe created a group and started our RP after much discussion and debate. I will not deny the fact that the writing skills were good. But what got me was the personal questions the user kept asking me.\n\nHow old are you? How many girlfriends did you have?  Are you steady? Where do you work? you earn much? etc. initially I was kind of reluctant and answered evasively. But there after gave satisfactory replies! So the repetition of the same question stopped. Phew!\n\nProblem started , when those answers that I gave in the OCC \u2018 of KIK, were used in our RP. I was shocked! Asked the user why were they doing it, and the reply which I got was , \u201c making it more realistic!\u201d\n\nI said fine , and continued the RP. But the users dialogues kept mentioning the facts I had told before. This bothered me and I thought that \u2018 tit for tat \u2018. So asked almost the same questions which the user asked me.\n\nZilch! I did not get any reply. The best I got was the \u2018 rolling eyes \u2018 , \u2018 rofl \u2018 and \u2018 tears of joy \u2018 smileys ! Since when did emoji\u2019s became answers to questions like who is your favourite author? Do you listen to music? Favourite holiday destination? I did not know what to do. It would be unwise for OCC to affect the RP.\n\nThen in one scene in the RP, I was a bit rough on the users character. OCC was the Hellfire missiles on me! I was like, look , you taunt me so much in RP I do not say anything.  But now when I am a little bit aggressive in the RP, why do you complain?\n\nPlus you never answered my questions such that I can taunt also!\n\n\u201c You are becoming attached!\u201d And \u201c Those questions were too personal!\u201d , were the replies I got. And I was like, since when asking about the favourite author or musician became signs of attachment ?\n\nUser left the RP and blocked me! And my OC never got to finish his honeymoon!  lol",

            "selftext": "Throwaway, because there is a possibility the person I am talking about might figure out my real tag. \n\nSo... I am in a roleplay of a space opera game. The scenario is an old and very beloved one, and I had been looking for a long time for someone into this particular anime. I found someone\u2014we'll call her Misty. She's really knowledgeable on this series, like down to the names of the smallest and most obscure characters, mecha details, the full monty.\n\nProblem with Misty... she has a canon character that is the female lead of the series. The character is interesting enough on her own. But Misty is adding plot armor (to be fair, the character already has this, just not to such a ridiculous degree), one-ups worse than a spoiled ten year old in a game of 'pretend', throws tantrums that absolutely blow the mind when she doesn't get her way, adds in abilities the character never had in the series (to the point that the character's not recognizable at all)... on and on and fucking on. \n\nI really care about Misty. She's a good person, has the biggest heart, but I am so frustrated with this. Any time I do basically anything, she immediately jacks it to add to her canon!sue. If I call her on it, she freaks and wants to delete the game (there are others playing). If I were to quit myself, it would hurt her deeply and maybe damage a friendship that has been there since 2006. \n\nAs the flair says... just needed to vent.",

            "selftext": "About two or three years ago, I co-owned a supernatural western server. Like, werewolves and vampires and stuff in the Wild West, for a solid image. At first, the co-host and I were deciding if we should filter people who enter the server since we'd had trouble before with low effort godmodders swarming in to our other mutual server. We decided a writing sample would be the best option, whoever had a decent grasp on writing in English could join, as to not be gatekeepers. \n\nWe had a good number of people, I think closing in to the 10s when a guy I'll call Billy joins. He sends me a sample through Reddit and it's a little...off kilter. Reads a little funny, it's about a shadowy loner gunslinger who enters a bar and asks for all the whiskey the barkeep has before contemplating how lonely and badass he is. Alright, whatever, I could at least read it. Everyone deserves a chance. \n\nI let the guy into the server, he bitches and moans about having to fill out our little character sheet. He barely filled it out or put in banned things, such as his character being a demi-god and being unkillable. Between me and the co-host, I think he was asked to fix it about six times before being allowed to play. And oh boy, that was a mistake. Should have just booted the guy at that trouble. \n\nHis first post was to the saloon, which read much like his sample. He busts in, demands all the whiskey he can drink, includes another person's character without asking, having her be sexually assaulted at the bar, where he then kills the attackers only to begin aggressively flirting with her. I'll call the player Duck. She and Billy RP for about three days over this scene, THREE DAYS of his character very aggressively neckbearding and moaning about being so powerful and lonely. She sends very timid one-liners, her character mostly fawning over his and stroking his Gary Stu ego. He refuses to RP with anyone else besides Duck and her OC. She never complains, though, so we leave it alone. You're allowed to have fun however you're having it, I guess.\n\nCo-host and I have to reprimand him a few times over these days. Once for just murdering people in the saloon with no repercussions and not asking before involving another player's character in such a graphic thing, once for making his character a demi-god again, and again for his character having a lightsaber? A lightsaber? Co-host and I then begin talking about kicking this guy when he starts acting like a dick OOC about me and the co-mod writing a gay romance. We tell him that's strike one, that he better behave, he just says whatever and goes back to only responding to Duck. Duck made a post once or twice in other channels and deleted the posts soon after. Not uncommon, sometimes people think again when starting two threads or are working out stuff for it. I didn't think anything of it.\n\nOne of the NPCs I played was the mayor of the small town and I brought him into the saloon. He's an incredibly old man whose surname is Pope. Billy writes about his character hating Pope and wanting to fight him but he feels weakened by 'the holy energy of The Pope'. He's not THE POPE, he's just a guy named Pope, and he would likely perish by thinking too hard he's so old. Me and co-host can't help but laugh about it. \n\nI then get a DM from Duck in the middle of laughing over this bullshit. She says that Billy is making her uncomfortable, he's DMing her what to make her character do and say and gets very upset if she disagrees. He's been doing that since the beginning and she can't get him to end the scene and won't let her start new threads.\n\nCo-host and I take Billy into DMs, explain to him that he's being kicked, and he says that's fine, he hates this server anyways because he can't have any fun. \n\nWe kick him, make the announcement that he has been kicked, and get a flood of messages. Apparently he'd tried to do the same thing in other people's DMs but they wouldn't play along, and he'd decided one guy was his buddy and complained to him about us reprimanding him so often. He'd been planning on leaving since he felt so oppressed by having to follow rules and not harass other people.\n\nSo basically, just a plague on the entire server and he should have never gotten past the door. Never feel that you have to bend to someone for RP and never be afraid to call out an asshat, there's only peace to be had. &lt;3",

I have a long request doc that lists just about everything about me and I am well known for being picky as fuck with who I play with. As a result I have a collection of a small number of long-term players who I mesh super well with.   \n\n\nI am usually looking for one or two more people, but that's because I cycle through a lot to find people I mesh well with AND because inevitably there are going to be ghosters. And sometimes none of my regulars wanna do my idea du jur, and that's okay!  \n\n\nIf it weren't for my very specific request document I never would have found these people because I'd be too busy sorting through requests from people I simply am not compatible with as a writer.  \n\n\nBeing hyper specific doesn't mean I shouldn't RP it just means I know what I want.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I exist again! Now, I wanted to post about another failed DRRP, however I genuinely didn't know how to construct the whole story of it - so instead I'll pose you a question that relates to it!! Also, sorry for typos, I'm typing this on my phone lol.\n\n This is mostly targeted at the people that rp in groups with long plots, but if you have anything that fits this, feel free to contribute anyway! I am curious about what people dislike in the big climaxes and endings! \n\nAnyway, the title is self-explanatory; what was the worst ending you've seen in an RP? As of now, a worst ending I've witnessed was in a recent DRRP - what a surprise - I was in. It had other issues, but I'll only focus on the ending for the above stated reason. For a bit context, every character was kidnapped from their own, fantasy, world and tossed into a killing game. For the finale, we were asked to go to the teleport room, which took us to another room with teleports for everyone. \n\nThen, we were told that we can only use our teleport and we won't remember *anything* from what happened in the KG. We were also unable to stay behind nor go into another universe with our friends, for example. So basically, all of this made EVERYTHING that we did in the RP useless and without any value. It was the \"It was all a dream\" ending but somehow made it even worse.\n\n It was unsatisfying, didn't let us learn about anything lore-related and made everything our characters went through and all the characters we bonded with unnecessary - it basically felt like me and others wasted time there cus nothing mattered in the end! \n\nTbh, the finale is still on going as those that didn't decide to return got a chance to face the one behind it - which is bs, as there was NO indication that this is possible and robbed me and others from plot-relevancy cus we had to stick to oir characters - cus it was paused due to the timezones and all. Buuuuuut it's been more than a week, so idk, I count it as an L.\n\nSo yeah, that was the worst written and executed ending I got so far - what about you all?",

            "selftext": "Anyone who RPs with me knows I have quite a few requirements for my RP partners. These aren't anything super stringent or anything, they're mostly genre preferences, my preferences for communication frequency, the kinds of topics I will and won't write about, etc.  \n\n\nDo I think I'm better than other people? Heck no. But if someone wants to write novella-length crime noir with a post once a month I'm probably not going to be compatible with them as a partner. Same for the person that wants to do script text horror. Why? Because those things aren't my genre, and that is *okay*.  \n\n\nI also have what I consider to be a fairly high number of limits compared to the average person. There are some really common tropes and interests I am just plain not interested in writing and never want to see. This is going to be an incompatibility for some people, but I've found surprisingly there are actually a large number of people with limits similar to mine.  \n\n\nMost of the things listed in my doc as a 'please don't do this' are also common-sense things that are in there because, you guessed it, someone did that thing.  \n\n\nBecause I have a long list of requirements I very rarely have RPs fizzle out after they've started unless someone has ghosted me, and that's not a thing that happens to me very often...but it did happen to me all the time before I had these requirements clearly written out. Because the selection is done entirely through pre-conversation and not via the RP.  \n\n\nTl;dr having a lot of requirements and being honest about what I wanted has helped me find good, steady partners more easily",

And if they've explicitly said they aren't into steampunk then you shouldn't bother them with a steampunk counter-prompt, either. But let's say the ad was for modern supernatural and you really dig their writing style and their general attitude... I think it's perfectly fine to say \"I love everything about your ad but I don't really like modern settings. Would you be open to steampunk?\"\n\nI don't like this pervasive mindset that the person who replies to a prompt should have to conform to *every* single rule or expectation put forth by the prompt poster. People who reply to ads have their own preferences, too. \n\nPosting prompts is very easy. It's very attractive to be able to sit back and let people eager to impress you flood your inbox.  Searching through prompts, on the other hand, is quite grueling work and can get demoralizing fast. I'm the type of person who pretty much only posts ads and rarely ever replies to other people's prompts, and I am *very* thankful that there ARE people out there who will take the time to sort through alllll those ads. I want to meet those people half-way.  If they propose a setting that wasn't listed in my ad, or a different character dynamic, I'm not going to be annoyed.  I can turn it down politely if I'm not into it.",

I can't in all fairness say that this is always a sign of a bad roleplayer, so please give your take on it even if you don't agree. I actually want to understand why people do this.\n\nSo this is what I don't understand: People who comment \"Interested\" on damn near every ad but don't seem to really follow up with anyone they say this to. I guess they want the person who posted the ad to respond to their interest in a message but the thing is, if they just comment something like \"Want to rp\" or \"Interested\" in respond to my ad followed by silence, I don't really get the impression that they want to do anything. This is particularly bizarre because this seems to happen a lot on ads where the person has already specified that they want you message them on reddit or Discord if you are interested and I can't really figure out why people repeatedly ignore that request in an ad.\n\nIs there a reason people refuse to reach out with a message even if the ad is asking them to? Is it immediately a bad sign that the person isn't paying attention to your ad? I would love some input on this. I think it's slightly bad etiquette but I don't think it's always bad roleplayers who do it. However, I will say that most of the time when someone comments this on my ad but doesn't follow up with anything and I reach out to them, it seems like they are actually pretty uninterested in roleplaying.",

            "selftext": "This is a former irl friend. We're no longer friends for unrelated reasons, but for several years she was the person I roleplayed with the most frequently. \n\nSo, I don't do fandom roleplays. And even if I can be persuaded to fandom roleplay, I refuse to do canons of any kind. Be it myself or my partner. I just prefer the fun of creating creators and developing them out, that being restricted to a canon just has zero appeal to me personally. But the friend in question did have interest in playing canons and I believe she may have did canon roleplays over tumblr. \n\nAnyway, the fact that I did not roleplay with canons was very much established between us, as we'd been roleplaying since middle school, and by this point we were adults. But, I suppose fortunately for my friend, I don't really watch very much TV or movies... So eventually, she started slipping established characters into *her* characters. A lot of times, I wouldn't really noticed, because I didn't watch what was popular at the time. But, it eventually got so bad that she would change the personalities of *established characters* of hers midway through roleplays to the point it was quite jarring. These being well established characters in whatever story we had going on. \n\nFor example, one character of hers (a character I rather enjoyed actually), was originally written to be a kind of brash-rough around the edges guy who was into wrestling, but was actually pursing to become a doctor. He was meant to be a twist on the jock/bully trope, and he was compelling enough of a character. But, whatever show she was watching at the time, she decided she wanted this character, well into him being established, to have a 'nerdy/geeky' aesthetic instead. Bow ties (bc Doctor Who was cool at the time), and suspenders. Nerdy kid. Instead of just... Making a new character. Nope, just turn this pre-existing and well established character to do a 180 because whatever she was into at the time made that more appealing. Which sure, wouldn't be an issue IF IT WAS A NEW CHARACTER.\n\nThat's just one, surface level example. There would also be times where we would have a new roleplay starting, with new characters-- And she would 100% (besides in name), attempt to play a character from a show and sneaking it past me. She did this attempting to play Benedict Cumberbatch's version of Sherlock (again, just changing the name, and taking away the super obvious \"Sherlock\"-isms), and then at another point I believe Christian Grey, back when I believe just the first 50 shades book out (so very pre-movies). Probably more too, that I just didn't catch because I don't indulge in too much media. But I figured out the Sherlock one reeeeal quick once I watched a whole 5 minutes of the show.\n\nIf you wanna play canon characters, cool, but I just found this to be SO lazy. She was capable of writing interesting characters, but as she got more wrapped up in fandom culture, her ability to keep any originality just straight up dipped. This wasn't even just in roleplay, either. Her entire personality would shift towards whatever fandom she was into at the time. To a ridiculous extent that I'm not even going to get into here because it's totally not roleplay related.\n\nAnyway, this was just a rant. I haven't spoken to this person in years now, but I roleplayed with them for so long that I probably have more \"bad roleplay\" stories I could attribute to them. They weren't an awful roleplayer, but if they had been a stranger on the internet and some of this shit was pulled on me, I would have bounced.",

            "selftext": "As weird and obvious the answer to the question may seem allow me to explain my situation..\nI am worried that roleplaying with my online friend group can be seen as bad purely because they are in the age range of 15-17 and I am 18.. \nwe all love to rp homestuck ocs as peculiar as it sounds, we never erp, or anything under that category the farthest we go is sometimes we ship our ocs and rp their relationship, (again nothing nasty just kisses or hugs) but I worry that among outsiders me rping an ocs relationship with my friends or rping anything tame like shopping at a store could be seen as bad.. Ever since I turned 18 I worried how people would see me interacting with my underage friends.. let alone rping with them.. I\u2019m not a bad person but does rping make me bad? I should mention everyone of my friends I\u2019ve rped with is fine rping what we do and if someone gets uncomfortable we stop, but again can it still be seen as bad on my case?",

It\u2019s the only way I seem to filter people, which feels a bit judge mental but at the same time I feel as it gives a pretty decent idea of the type of role player they are usually. \n\nI feel a bit guilty about it, because as I said it feels as if I\u2019m being quite judgmental. But it seems to help with filtering out those who typically want to write smut or erp (which is fine, but I just tend to run into a lot of people who just want to base the entire roleplay around that which I don\u2019t like).",

Mary Sue, and now I found myself realizing that the OC my RP partner created is very much a \"perfect\" little angel. \n\nIn the starting stages, they talked a lot about their OC, saying that they were a \"cute little thing\" that has a sweets addiction and wears colorful clothing despite the roleplay being in the setting of Psycho-Pass, a cyberpunk thriller anime about cops and criminals. It didn't seem right for the setting, and to pour salt in the wound, they kept pushing the idea of their love interest ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS commenting on their OC's outfit. They also wanted me to play the love interest, a stern and determined man, completely incorrectly. They wanted him to be a softie, and just melt instantly for her. \n\nI will say, the first few responses were great, actually. Everything was balanced, the responses were flowing, and I considered that maybe I was being unreasonable about feeling the way I did prior...\n\n...Until this happened. \n\nSlowly, I began to realize all the canon characters were paying so much attention to her OC. I felt that my OC was being left out, even after we planned out on how the relationships between OCs and canons would flow. It even got to a point where my OC's love interest was always worried about their OC, and would often give one worded responses about mine, before going into paragraphs about her OC . It just seemed like they wanted the story to be about their OC, and their OC alone. \n\nAlso, in out of character, our chats are filled to the brim about her OC. She never wants to talk about anything else. In fact, I remember when I posted my OC, she said something like, \"oh your OC is DEFINITELY going to sympathize mine.\" Like how dare you? Not everything is about your OC and you don't know how my OC will react?\n\nAll of this made me uncomfortable. The worst part was when she had her OC act out an illness. It was apparent to me she did no research on it, and it reminded me of TikTokers faking disorders. It was just... so offensive, since I have said illness and I know for a fact it's not like that at all. \n\nThank you for letting me vent. I'm sorry if I seem brash or rude, I'm just tired of this encounter. It wasted so much time and I'm frustrated.",

            "selftext": "Story happened a few years ago. I still think about it sometimes. Very NSFW elements ahead.\n\nI was roleplaying with this guy that didn't indent his paragraphs and had pretty horrible pacing. BUT, the story and setting were interesting, and I actually enjoyed his character and how he wrote dialogue, so I tried to muscle through the lack of paragraph indents (text walls of doom) and the pacing issue.\n\nFor example on the pacing, any time any action would play out, instead of us writing out the scene beat for beat, he would just zoom through an entire sequence and I had to play catch up with my response. This included our characters sneaking into an infirmary to steal pills/medical supplies (they were drug addicts), then slipping out. His character led the way, but instead of going beat for beat, he went ahead and described the whole enter break in, stealing, and get away sequence in one post. It was a nightmare to respond to as there was little for me to actually *do* since the character's mission started and completed in one swoop. And, all of this done in a giant wall of text that would have been about 4-6 paragraphs worth, but instead it was just one giant wall. (honestly, 100% on me for not asking him to indent sooner, but I decided to just muscle through it)\n\nThankfully I didn't think this would be an action heavy roleplay, so maybe incidents like this wouldn't be... *too* frequent. So, I carried on because I'm often too shy to bring up complaints (my bad). I figured once our characters got a chance to sit down, chill out, and communicate, the pacing would slow down since they're just chilling and talking. \n\nFor a moment, I thought thinks were going in that positive direction. We finally had time to let our characters talk... They even shared a kiss (not exactly a romantic context, they were high so it felt like a natural occurrence at that point in time), but before I even had a chance for my character to properly react to being kissed, his character proceeds to *strip my character down totally naked, then go down on her*. Just. One post. One moment their chatting, getting high, then he kisses her-- And then in one long wall of text post from him, he's going into full smut without any lead up besides a single kiss, she's totally naked, and then he describes her orgasm. All the while, I hadn't even been given room for my character to react to a single thing.\n\n This was NOT an ERP. Now granted, I'm fine with NSFW scenes happening. Especially given the context of the situation, and it's characters that are inebriated and looking to entertain themselves. But like, NO WARNING lol None at all. And no room for my character to even get a chance to protest if she *wasn't* down for hanky panky.\n\nNow. This probably leads things back to being my bad because I should have said something about slowing down the pacing earlier, but I honestly did not expect for things to go so quickly into full smut with no warning. The guy honestly seemed like a competent writer besides those few issues... But, that's just kind of where I threw in the towel and bounces.",

            "selftext": "Okay so. I\u2019m pretty sure this is my first post on this blog, but I have tones of anecdotes from being an admin over on Tumblr for over five years. I ran games prior to that, but this five year stretch was for a single game. For those of you who have been on Tumblr, you know that\u2019s a heckin\u2019 FEAT.\n\nSo here\u2019s some stories for your entertainment.\n\n1.) So the story of how I became an admin for this game is dramatic all by itself. It was a game run by different people in the very beginning. Premise was basically the typical \u201call superheroes have to register\u201d plucked out of MCEU, but it was fun. I joined as a villain character because they aren\u2019t typically played (they\u2019re hard, so I get that), and had that uncomfortable experience of people wanting their characters to be victimized all the time. But that\u2019s another story. \n\nIn general, it was a blast. The rp accepted all canons - shows, movie verse, etc., and it could get messy, but it all seemed to work out. The mods were\u2026 well, they seemed nice, but one of them (a guy, let\u2019s call him Charlie) left early on. Anita was brought on board to replace him, leaving us with three mods: Raquel, Anita, and Sally. Of the three of them, I remember Anita the most because she would constantly post rude anons on the dash and I thought that was very off putting. She would also rant about them in the OOC group (back before discord, when all we had were side blogs), and seemed a little immature.\n\nSo everything is all well and good. Until it isn\u2019t. Out of the blue, Charlie returns in a very big way. He still has access to the login and he posts a SCATHING post about Raquel and Sally, revealing a conversation he had with them in private. Basically the conversation was them conspiring to get rid of a player they didn\u2019t like. There was some misunderstanding where the player suggested a ship without knowing that the characters were related (in that canon) and they lost their minds. So the group exploded because the conversation was pretty\u2026 well. It was hard to read. The involved player was extremely hurt and embarrassed, especially because they hadn\u2019t known that the characters were related and immediately backed off upon finding out.\n\nMeanwhile I haven\u2019t read the post and am chilling in the chat when Sally posts an ominous \u201cI guess this is goodbye\u201d, which freaks me out. The admins all collectively decide to leave, along with Charlie, and they offer to give the group to someone else to admin. I offer, along with two other players. \n\nSo we take over. All is good. It\u2019s a big rocky at first, but we adjust and move forward. There\u2019s some weird anons about us stealing the rp, which is weird, but the three of us decide that we are going to ignore anon hate and keep it off the dash. We\u2019re here to write and support our players, not spread negativity.\n\nUntil.\n\nWe have someone apply as one of Raquel\u2019s beloved characters. \n\nRaquel loses her mind.\n\nShe logs into the game (we are idiots and didn\u2019t change the password, you\u2019d think after the Charlie fiasco we\u2019d know better, but we had no beef with these mods and didn\u2019t think we needed to protect ourselves) and she promptly begins to delete EVERYTHING. We are scrambling to access to the email so we can get it back, panicking, because it was all out members\u2019 OOC info, character information, literally EVERYTHING. \n\nEventually she calms down and admits she was jealous that someone else was going to play \u201cher\u201d character and is very apologetic. Unfortunately we are traumatized and decide the best thing to do is to start a new blog with a different name and build the site ourselves. We never told our members about this and played it off as a \u201cfresh start\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t be subjected to the stress we had to deal with. The previous admins just involved us in every piece of drama that existed and it got so exhausting - we didn\u2019t want to be like that.\n\nSo THAT drama actually ended well. \n\n2.) This second story is a little crazier y\u2019all. It\u2019s like some MsScribe shit. Okay, so, this new player joins us. Her name is Amy. Amy plays this super sweet character who is pretty much how Amy is OOC. Amy\u2026 was the love bomby type. Came off as very supportive, kind, and positive. I remember she hadn\u2019t been there very long and she was already getting anons. Typically these anons were overly flattering to her and her character \u201comg I love you!!!!!! Can I marry you??\u201d with Amy acting very gracious and humble in her reply. I thought this was weird at the time because she\u2019d been with us like, a day, but I wouldn\u2019t have said it was a red flag.\n\nSo Amy brought in two \u201creal life\u201d friends to join the rp. I was like\u2026 huh, well\u2026 that\u2019s cool. What are the chances that two of your real life friends also happen to rp this particular genre? One of the friends was a girl named Nicole and the other was her gay friend Joel. They all wrote characters with close ties to one another, but\u2026 hardly ever wrote together. They had similar styles too. Now, I was around for that MsScribe insanity so your girl is already paranoid. I was noticing this almost immediately, but I didn\u2019t say anything about it. At the time we had a character limit, so I figured since she\u2019d already reached her limit, she was using sock puppets to write as more people. It was against the rules, but it\u2019s harmless, and I also couldn\u2019t prove it. I let it go.\n\nThen it got weird. Suddenly Amy is having all of these health problems, notably migraines, and Nicole or Joel would rush to my DMs and very dramatically tell me her status and \u201ckeep me updated.\u201d All of my conversations with them revolved around Amy. \n\nBut they made a mistake. \n\nI don\u2019t discuss my personal shit, I wouldn\u2019t do it here if it weren\u2019t relevant, but I was born with a brain malformation that went undiagnosed into my early 20s. It would give me seizures, fainting spells, and the most painful migraines I can possibly describe. I also have lupus. So, I spent a lot of time in the hospital and I\u2019m very familiar with how they handle shit. A lot of the experiences Amy told me she had didn\u2019t make a lot of sense. For example, she\u2019d tell me she was seeing a specific specialist when she would have been referred to a completely different specialist for that particular problem. She would also say the doctors would send her home even after she\u2019d been screaming and writhing on the floor of the ER because of her headache, which\u2026 no. If your headache is that bad, they would be way too paranoid that it could be a blood clot and you go to the front of the line for tests. They don\u2019t do nothing and send you home. But yeah, it was just\u2026 weird things that didn\u2019t add up. \n\nJoel, meanwhile, had asked for a hiatus so he could go to boot camp. He swiftly returned for the Amy drama and claimed they gave him a furlough. Understanding folk, those military. \n\nAt this point I decide to do a little research. She\u2019s on Facebook, but it only takes one look to see that she\u2019d not a 21 year old college student. She\u2019s in her 30s. I also find her gay friend Joel. He\u2019s her husband. And I find Nicole, who has a completely different name. I also find out Amy has been on one of MTV\u2019s true life episodes (I am not even kidding.) it gets very insane. \n\nNow, unless you are a minor, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with lying about your age and name. However, the hospitalizations and using these accounts (at least \u201cJoel\u201d, I guess \u201cNicole\u201d could have been real but I highly doubt it) to garner sympathy and concern from all of us took it too far. She told us she had cancer at some point. Again, I can\u2019t say that she never did have cancer, because I don\u2019t really know, but\u2026 yeah. So. We gathered the evidence we had and basically presented it and asked her to leave the group.\n\nShe did. She joined a different group. \u201cJoel\u201d and \u201cNicole\u201d did not follow her.\n\nThere was one player that gave her the benefit of the doubt and stayed in contact with both sides. Her name was Devon. However, issues started to arise because of some ic drama (I think, I can\u2019t remember the details), and Devon asked for some space.\n\nThe VERY NEXT DAY, Devon messages me in a panic because apparently Amy was so distraught that she jumped in front of a train. Yeah. A subway train. She was in the hospital, uninjured because I guess someone pulled her up, and of course she had a loyal friend being her laptop so she could keep updating on all of her characters.\n\nWell. In pretty much every state, including the one she lived in (I checked), an attempted suicide results in a mandatory psychiatric evaluation and hold. You do not get access to a computer, or Wi-Fi, or even your phone. There were no articles about this supposed incident either. It was all just another attempt to illicit sympathy. \n\nDevon cut off contact with her and that was the official end of the Amy saga. She\u2019s actually pretty prolific now as a catfish and several other people have come forward with their experiences. I used a fake name because I do believe this girl was suffering and I don\u2019t want to put her on full blast - however, the sympathy plays and fake suicide attempt really took it way too far.\n\nI have tons more but these are the most insane ones.",

            "selftext": "I'm sure I'm not the only one who's noticed the different reply styles. As far as I can tell, there's two distinct types, what I've nickednamed Pick Up and Through. \n\nI myself am a Pick Up replier. I find that it works best in RP, and it looks a little like this: \n\n&gt;**Player 1:**   \nThe pizza slapped on the pavement, red sauce splattered from the edges like gore. \"It's the aliens, Scully,\" Mulder said, turning to squint up at the overcast sky. \"It's the damn aliens...trying to starve me out because I know their secrets.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Player 2:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"It's not aliens, Mulder.\" Scully sighed, resting her hands on her hips as she looked down at the mess. At least the shop was only a few yards away. \"C'mon, I got pizza insurance. We can fix this.\"\n\nFor Through, it looks like this:\n\n&gt;**Player 1:**  \nThe pizza slapped on the pavement, red sauce splattered from the edges like gore. \"It's the aliens, Scully,\" Mulder said, turning to squint up at the overcast sky. \"It's the damn aliens...trying to starve me out because I know their secrets.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Player 2:**   \nScully watched as the pizza fell, the box gaping open. She looked to Mulder as he spoke before sighing. \"It's not aliens, Mulder.\" She rested her hands on her hips, listening as he spoke again. \"It's not aliens, they're not trying to starve you out!\" She huffed before looking over her shoulder at the shop only paces away. \"C'mon, I got pizza insurance. We can fix this.\"\n\nBeing a Pick Up replier, I find it a little difficult to write with Through repliers. They're just kind of making actions I can't reply to, because, honestly, I can't wrap my head around TWO Through repliers. It just seems like it would turn into a wad of backtracking mess after a while, but I could be wrong, never tried it!  \n\n\nMy personal preference is for another Pick Up replier, I was wondering what everyone else's are? Are you a Through with a Through, a little TxT action? Do Through repliers prefer Pick Up repliers? Has anyone's reply style killed the interest for you?",

            "selftext": "So this girl on Amino PMed me a while back wanting to roleplay. I said sure, and we talked about what plot we should do and all that jazz. Eventually I sent her the OC I would use, and I asked what OC she would use. She said she would come up with one and send it to me soon, so I waited\u2026and waited. By \u201csoon,\u201d I figured she meant in a day or two, if not at least in a few hours since she made it sound like she was very nearly done and just needed to add a few things or just put some finishing touches.\n\nAfter about four or five days, I left the chat since it seemed like she was never going to send anything and I assumed she forgot about our chat.\n\nThen she started hounding my profile not long (the same day/afternoon IIRC) after I left our chat: DMing me, posting on my wall, etc. She even went so far as to DMing me on an alternate account, which I responded to because I didn\u2019t know it was her. She proceeded to go off on me, accusing me of ghosting her for days and then just up and leaving. She also complained that I wasn\u2019t being respectful of her real life, but she also never said a single word about having to deal with anything IRL. She claimed that she got her phone confiscated so she wasn\u2019t able to send me anything, which I guess is fair but it seemed kinda crap to me at the time since it had only been 4/5 days, and assuming it was confiscated during that time, it seemed like she got her phone back *really* fast. (Though I suppose she could have snuck it or been secretly using someone else\u2019s device.)\n\nLike, if she\u2019d originally said, \u201cI\u2019ll get my OC to you soon, but it might be a bit longer because of IRL things,\u201d or said so at some point, I would have understood. And yeah, it\u2019s understandable to be annoyed whenever people just leave a chat with you without explanation. But really, what annoyed me about the way she confronted me was the way she got so angry about it as though this had any actual effect on her life, and the fact that she pinned pretty much all the blame on me and made me sound like I was the bad guy.\n\nIronically, when I responded to her explaining that I left because she took literal days to send anything about her character\u2014not even about any progress she made\u2014she took forever to respond despite just chewing me out about \u201cghosting\u201d her. After I said my piece, she was just like \u201cSorry I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten mad, it\u2019s just the internet\u201d I was???? So baffled??? Like she literally went on a whole-ass rant at me about how awful I was for \u201cghosting\u201d her and \u201cnot being respectful about [her] real life\u201d and then suddenly does this turn-around??? Just\u2026WTF.",

This happened recently, but man i have never dealt with someone like this in a long time. Was Asked to rp, i had a idea. But slow replies via the week, reply when i am free. Ect. \n\nThis person, i dont know why, but they get mad real quick. Especially if someone doesn\u2019t answer. Right away, and i do *mean right away.* I like to tell whoever i am chatting/plotting ooc  with that there will be slow replies due to RL, since like many of us here have lives outside of roleplaying, and have days where we just aren\u2019t feeling up too doing much, or are busy. This person absolutely hated that, because they would spam me (on both dms here and elsewhere) every second, literally every second, even when i told them that if my replies are slow that does not mean that i am ignoring anyone, i just have things to do. (Such as eating, taking care of me, ) i still needed to do laundry, and sleep. This person though, kept at it. \n\nI asked politely if they wouldnt spam, to which again i had to say: Slow replies, had things to do. Life. Reply when i can. \n\nHell they even started timing me. On how long i was gone. I got pissed and told them again not to spam/time me and to have the common decency to understand i have a life away from the screen. \n\nFast forward i told them my character. They changed it, my character, when it is my character, they dont get to decide what to do with them/how they are, because it is a character that i created/ pictured ( i have a vision impairment disability , partially sighted so i try to picture in my mind about how my character is) , not them. I have one rule and that is not to change my characters, at all. That is my decision alone. Was going to leave/block. Bye. Again, they were mad. \n\nOh they were not happy at all. Then they did something I wouldn\u2019t even *think* of doing: in the inbox  they threatened to cause (TW!) harm to themselves, and guilt me into replying unblocking and have my oc change completely to satisfy what they wanted. I blocked again on dms here. \n\nWhile i myself am an adult, i felt like i was dealing with a tantrum throwing child. Yet they were an adult too, apparently. But im older, and i at least respect and understand that we, as people ( who rp) have ocs that we took time to create as well as lives outside of the screen, we cant be on 24/7 and reply in a matter of seconds. \n\nLong story short: plz don\u2019t spam , no changing ppls characters; that are not your own creations and please do not use self harm (or even suicide ) as a way to guilt/bait people into replying. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "It's time for another roleplaying horror story. This one's from almost half a year ago because I was waiting to see if there was any follow-up to me dipping from the game, but at this point I'm satisfied that there won't be. So fair warning, that title is in no way hyperbole. If you don't wanna read about nazis today, there's your warning.\n\nSo. A guy from a mutual Tabletop LFRP chatroom hit me up in DMs. We spent a good couple of hours just kinda chatting about whatever. The conversation was engaging and pleasant. He brings up his homebrew system he's worked on and invites me to join a Discord server to play with him and a group. We spend another couple of hours chatting about that so I can get a feel for the system, what you can do in it, the limitations, whether it'll accommodate my character ideas, getting a feel for what type of DM he'd be, all that jazz. At no point during the several hours of discussion did I get a single red flag talking to this guy. The most disagreeable thing he said to me was undue criticism of D&amp;D, but that's y'know... whatever. No system's for everyone.\n\nSo I finally get invited to the server, join and... immediately I know something's off. There's a dude with  the Schutzstaffel runes in his name. Y'know, the ones that look kinda like double lightning bolts. I kinda cringe, but I choose to stick around and get a better feel for what to expect. For all I know that dude is a problem player who will be dealt with soon. For all I know it's just shitty humor. I know at some point I'm going to have to say something or dip, but I put it off for now.\n\nI do a little bit of RP with the guy I talked with before. That goes well enough. I have no complaints about that other than that some concerns I had about what the system would let me do came up and I felt mislead. Nothing I'd normally consider worthy of a post here though. Everyone is really nice/welcoming to me and happy for me to be there.\n\nBut on the other hand, I couldn't help but notice conversations going on in other channels where people, including the guy who invited me, were discussing the awful things they'd like to do to jews. Only they didn't use the word jews. The tone of this conversation was one of frustration, not irony/humor. There were a couple of other really sketchy conversations that happened. And overall there was no resistance to these things being said. Nobody ever said anything to me directly and I chose to continue observing. It became clear to me that this was just the nature of the server.\n\nI stopped showing up to games because I knew the shit I'd seen would just bother me regardless of whether the RP was decent. And thankfully people just kinda stopped paying attention to me. So after a bit of lurking I wound up leaving without ever saying anything. I figured it was a pointless waste of my sanity / blood pressure picking a fight with them and I probably would've just been banned because there was zero chance of me being polite about what was bothering me. Thankfully I was not contacted about having left. If I had been, I probably would've been upfront about why I left. But damn was I shook at the time and I was perfectly content to just get away at that point. My head was full of questions like:\n\nWhat the hell gave these guys the impression I'd be okay with being surrounded by nazi shit? \n\nNo seriously, did I do something to attract their attention? Is this my fault somehow?\n\nIt messed me up for a bit. The way my friends put it was that it probably wasn't anything I did so much as that I was generally fun to be around and they were just hoping to get lucky. And I get it. Because in reality I am everything those types of people hate and I don't exactly fly close to the sun with my sense of humor. But it took me months to stop feeling insecure about it. =/ Just... fuck. I wish there was a better way I could've avoided that but there wasn't.",
