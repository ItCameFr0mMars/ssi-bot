            "selftext": "Okay guys. Here it is. Part thrEE. For those of you who haven't seen my previous posts, I adminned an rp on Tumblr for over five years and have decided to detail a handful of experiences. \n\nThis one is difficult to get through, because it was one of the more affecting experiences I had as an admin. It's also fairly recent. This story explains why we ended up closing the game after 5+ years. It's also only going to be ONE story, but uh... it's long af. If you get through the whole thing I'll be shocked, but it's worth it. It's intense.\n\nSO. This one heavily features another user on this subreddit (my co-admin), so I want to make it clear that I sent this post to him before publishing it here. It deals with a lot of things that happened to both of us over a course of... wow, maybe two years? So I didn't want to share it without clearing it with him first. \n\nI've known my co-admin for 20+ years. Two fucking decades. We've met in real life a handful of times, even went on vacation together, and I consider him to be my best friend. We roleplayed with each other a little bit prior to connecting through this particular fandom and were close, but we didn't become AS close until we ran this game together.\n\nI want to preempt this story by saying that my co-admin (I'll call him Seamus even though I don't think he's Irish) and I are a lot alike. We have similar senses of humor and get along really well. Both of us are on the more rational side of emotionality. We've had conflict between each other, but we know how to communicate and we're typically on the same page of \\*wanting\\* to solve the issue, and it's really rare that we actually fight.\n\nBasically it was the dream team.\n\n(Still is the dream team.)\n\nSO. I want to say that back in 2019, I wasn't AS active with the group. I was really busy with my job because I'd just been promoted to management, my boss was out for knee replacement surgery like 3 times (one of the surgeries got messed up), AND it was the holiday season. I worked in diamonds. I WAS V BUSY.\n\nAround this time was when the group made the shift from the Tumblr OOC side-blogs to using discord. I wasn't great with the transition. I was hardly ever in the discord and was often missing shit. It was hard for me to keep up with who was who on an OOC level, since I mostly stayed on Tumblr and didn't have the time to engage as much as Seamus.\n\nAt some point during this, Seamus was a member of a different rp group where he met Dina. He brought Dina to our game. I actually liked her and thought she was a decent writer, but we didn't really interact at all at first. I didn't get to know her personally for a while after she joined.\n\nBy the time I DID finally have more time and started being around the discord more, they'd gotten to be really close friends. This didn't bother me - Seamus has brought people from other games before and he has good taste when it comes to people/talent - but... the way that she interacted with me was a little weird. Whenever we were talking, she'd find a way to bring up Seamus or talk about their inside jokes, almost like she was WANTING me to know that they were friends. She was even calling him Seamie (not exactly, but that's the closest comparison I could use with this fake name ya'll). I remember being surprised since Seamus hadn't really talked about this person with me at all before. The way she acted with me didn't give me the best first impression, but I kept most of those feelings to myself because I thought it would come off like I was jealous or didn't like her. That wasn't it, it was just... an off vibe. Like Seamus and I would be talking and she would quickly assert herself as Important To Him. I think I brought this up once and Seamus and I both laughed a little over it, but we both dismissed the whole thing as silly.\n\nANyWAY, Dina and I got along fine. There was one occasion when we butted heads, but to me it wasn't an argument. We were talking about a character I was playing and how her role in the media has changed over time. I stated that I liked to play her more true to her roots rather than how she's currently portrayed and explained why. She immediately told me she \"disagreed\" and wanted to argue about it for some reason. \n\nI just told her that I didn't need her to agree with me. I'm the one playing the character and I'm confident in my portrayal. I was polite, even though I thought it was a little rude that she was openly arguing with me in discord about how I wanted to play my own character. But w/e. \n\nThat was how she was. She had to state her opinion. About everything. All of the time. Then she'd get pissy if people didn't fall in line. It was exhausting sometimes, especially because she would rant about things that I knew other members LIKED. I'm all for everyone having their own opinions, but she simply could not abide by letting other people enjoy things without tearing it to pieces and making them feel shitty for it. It just boggled my mind that she felt the need to insert her opinion constantly like she had some sort of authority, or felt attacked just because someone else didn't like to pair navy blue with black. Idk. She just struck me as extremely insecure and bulldozy with her opinions. She stated them like facts.\n\nStill, I did get close to Dina. She was funny and often very sweet. She sent me gifts for my birthday and even made me a video. She was a great writer, SUCH potential, and I was excited to plot with her characters. We even had a few ships going that were very exciting and fun to develop. She also had ships with Seamus, and of course I had ships with Seamus. The three of us probably had the most shipping/plotting between each other, but not to the point where we were a bubble.\n\nSo things were going fine. Her main ship with Seamus was her primary focus, which never bothered me because we had our own thing going, and I had my own thing going with Seamus. It was all well and good.\n\nUntiL, of course, it wasn't.\n\nSo the Big Ship (the main ship between Dina and Seamus) hit some rocky times. Basically, Seamus' character was going through some severe PTSD and Seamus had plotted out this angsty plot for them to do. Dina was all on board, but then decided that she didn't like how long it was taking Seamus' character to be \"over it\" and complained about how his character was dealing with the trauma. HER character began to fall apart and exert pressure on Seamus' character. Instead of it being a hurt/comfort plot focused on Seamus' character's trauma, she shifted the plot so that Seamus' character had to take care of HER character and her character's reaction to the trauma reaction of the other character. It was... messy. I kind of saw some of it happening from the outside, enough to have a hunch about what was going on, but Seamus never complained to me about it. He never talked badly about Dina at all.\n\nBut I can't say the same for Dina. She was all up in my DMs constantly, bitching about how Seamus didn't have muse at the moment and wasn't \"in the mood\" to write her favorite ship. At the same time, she was telling him that she'd just go \"elsewhere\" to \"get her fix\" if he wouldn't write with her and rub it in his face. When he would get quiet, she'd bitch to me that he was \"jealous\" and \"possessive\", without telling me that he reacted after she threatened to go write their ship with other people. \n\nI want to be clear that Seamus isn't a jealous person and wouldn't care if she were writing that ship with other people. It bothered him that she was USING this tactic as manipulation and THAT is what he was reacting to. \n\nDina also got it in her head that Seamus didn't \"like\" the way she wrote her character, for some reason, even though what bothered Seamus was how the plot was handled. From what I understand, the characterization wasn't the issue. She never let this idea go. For a whole ass year. The two of us must have told her over four dozen times that Seamus did not \"hate\" her character. It didn't matter. She was convinced. \n\nSo she was fixated on this and wanted to discuss nothing else, including what \\*we\\* had going on. This started to bother me because I was actually rather invested in what we were doing and felt hurt that she was ignoring it. Meanwhile, she'd complain about how hurt she was that Seamus was doing that exact thing to her. When I did try to ask (a whole three times total over the course of knowing her) if she were still interested, she would take it as an attack and basically lose her shit. I'd even go out of my damn way to formulate the question in a non-accusatory manner, and start it off by stating, \"I know you've been distracted lately, this is probably just me being a little insecure, but I just want to make sure you're still interested!\" \n\nIt was a simple, direct question that assigned no blame to anyone but myself, and yet she'd find a way to get mad at me for asking it. It was like she resented being reminded that I wasn't there just to be her emotional sounding board. It was bizarre. I just. LOL. So, it was a mess for a few months, but it did seem to get back on track. Sort of.\n\nIn the meantime, Seamus had picked up a new character and happened to have a LOT of muse for him. Dina immediately threw everyone but the kitchen sink at this character for Seamus to ship with. They did have a ship that lasted a little while, because the ship that Seamus wanted wasn't available, but he made it clear to her that the ship they were writing wasn't endgame. He was more interested in a different ship when and if someone showed up to play the character.\n\nEventually someone did. Once Seamus developed a rapport with the new player, he did end the ship with Dina in order to write the new ship, which is something he told her he would do before they ever started. Well. Dina was EXTREMELY salty about this and made comments in the OOC constantly until Seamus had to tell her to stop. It was obvious she was upset and pissed off about it, even though she went out of her way to act like she wasn't, because she would not. let. it. go.\n\nThe new player that was writing with Seamus was someone Dina ostensibly hated, of course. Eventually the new player did end up going inactive. \n\nOnce they did, I picked up the character and Seamus and I continued the ship. \n\nDina was very stubborn about disliking this particular character I played and at first would have nothing to do with him, then EVENTUALLY warmed up a little.\n\nShe warmed up a little too much, actually.\n\nHer next character was a character that is frequently shipped in a polyamorous relationship with the ship Seamus and I were in (the ship she kept trying to throw shit at until it sticks). IMMEDIATELY she started talking about this ship with both of us to \"test\" how we felt about it. I wasn't interested. Seamus wasn't either. I have nothing against polyamorous ships, but the character she wanted for it was just not one I was interested in doing it with for other, unrelated reasons, and eh. It was a pass. \n\nShe was EXTREMELY bothered by this and even argued with me about how I should \"try\" the ship, then mocked the fact that I was using \"feelings\" to decide something instead of logic, because she knows I try to be a rational person. I just told her that having preferences isn't being emotional and I just don't like about the ship, so I didn't see why I should write it. She dropped the character after that. \n\nAt this point it was starting to be a running joke that she was obsessed with Seamus' new character, considering everything she was doing to try and establish ships, and she would even do everything she could to degrade or demean the ship I was in with him by \"accidentally\" sending me scenes they were writing together. That bothered me a lot, but I knew she was jealous and tried to ignore it.\n\nI want to reiterate that they were still writing their ship during this time. I don't think it was AS often, because Dina was making the dynamic extremely uncomfortable with Seamus and reading everything into his responses, so it was starting not to be enjoyable for him anymore. He was sticking it out, though. I saw several of their conversations where he was trying to make it work and power through. Dina would go along with it, but then whine to me about the same shit and nothing would really change at all. \n\nSo, aside from the shipping, there also started to be issues between other platonic characters we all played together. For example, we played three canon brothers. Seamus and I had been playing the brothers long before Dina picked up the third one. They had a contentious relationship that we slowly fleshed out over the course of a YEAR, there were a lot of things we did with them to get them there, and we had a lot of established foundation for them as far as HOW they got to be closer. \n\nWell, when Dina picked up the third brother, she immediately tried to assert a closeness with Seamus' brother that didn't yet exist in canon, without having to work for it. This was something she tried to do IN CHARACTER, which resulted in disastrous interactions. Her character would suck up adoringly to Seamus' character. Seamus' character, being distrustful of his brothers and uncomfortable with emotion in general, wouldn't be immediately receptive to it. Then Dina's character would throw a tantrum. Ad nauseum.\n\nShe'd run to me and bitch about how Seamus \"didn't like how she played her character.\" This was becoming a thing. Whenever Seamus didn't have his characters do what she wanted, she'd complain that he didn't like them and throw a fit until he felt pressured to give in. It was starting to weigh us both down so heavily that he had to write his characters purposefully out of character just to avoid hurting her feelings. Somehow she'd find something to be offended by, even if it was meant a completely different way. Or she'd take issue with something Seamus' characters DIDN'T do.\n\nSigh. \n\nSO.\n\nIn the midst of all of this was when [story 2 of part 2 drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/q1hxlt/tales_of_an_exadmin_pt_2/) went down. Iris left and took a bunch of members with her. Her main issue was with the three of us, so she blocked us three (me, Seamus, and Dina), but it was me she actively portrayed as a bully and pushed that narrative on the new game she started. During this time I was shaken up and extremely hurt and upset. Dina and Seamus both gave me support and I felt like they truly were on my side.\n\nWell, Seamus was.\n\nCome to find out, Dina prostrates herself to Iris, agrees with her narrative about me being Bad, and joins their group under a fake name so we won't find out. The only reason I figured it out was because her blog popped up as a \"suggested\" blog on Tumblr (and she's not subtle). I was shocked, because Iris was actively smearing my name through the mud and NOW Dina was telling me that she \"saw her side\" of the situation. She told me that she needed this rp to be happy. My feelings were swept aside and I felt like I couldn't even feel upset about it, because that would come off like I was trying to control who she wrote with.\n\nAnd that wasn't what I wanted. It still felt like a massive betrayal that she would join a group run by someone and claim to \"agree\" with their absolutely terrible portrayal of me. I was extremely hurt. She claimed to understand that I felt hurt and told me she was willing to talk about my feelings when they came up.\n\nI accepted this and moved on. I just wasn't ready to lose anther friend, so I was willing to swallow my pride and be okay with the fact that she was playing both sides, even though I knew she was talking badly about me behind my back. I didn't really want there to be sides AT ALL, but my attempts to mend things with the other group were ignored. It was just hard to see her sucking up to people who were making my life hell, without care to what it was doing to me. It was a lot.\n\nSeamus was also upset about it, of course, but we both agreed to just let it go.\n\nWell, the first time my \"feelings\" popped up, she immediately ghosted me. For a whole week. So she could \"decide\" whether or not she wanted to be my friend or continue interacting with me. This absolutely devastated me. She threw back things in my face that I know were said to her by the leader of the other group, which weren't even true, and it was... so unsettling, honestly. It was like she wanted a reason to hate me. Like she never even knew me. It really made me question myself and my own intentions, too. I suddenly wondered if I truly WAS a terrible person who deserved all of this. The only person I talked to about any of it was Seamus, who was also the only person who kept me sane. My self-esteem and self-worth was taking a severe beating, though. Everything Dina did and said sent the message that she didn't care about me or about how I felt. She never extended any empathy and even told a mutual friend that she \"didn't agree\" about my feelings being hurt. She just gave no fucks.\n\nAt some point she turns against Iris and the other group too, of course, but for now it was my turn.\n\nEventually she decided she'd talk to me again and wrote me a long post basically stating that we could keep writing and be in contact but that I couldn't \"make her feel guilty\" for not writing. Or something. And she wanted to focus on our other ships. I was fine with this, and assumed she meant that me asking if she was still interested (the single time I did) was making her feel guilty. I did tell her that I might need reassurance on the rare occasion, but that it wasn't meant to make her feel guilty or pressure her. \n\nShe also said she wanted to be able to talk about the roleplay she joined without \"feeling bad about it\", because otherwise I was \"stifling\" her. So I had to swallow everything and sit there and listen to her brag about the new group she joined with the leader that destroyed my reputation as if it didn't bother me at all. I was afraid to even show one tiny reaction, including putting a period in the wrong place, because I risked being accused of guilt-tripping her. \n\nI was fucking miserable.\n\nThank god for Seamus.\n\nAnyway, Dina was having some weird issue with the character who was in the ship we had together. She wanted to undo an action she took with him and was questioning whether or not it was in character. This came out of nowhere and the action she took as the character was an action the character actually... took in canon... so it wasn't out of character, but I was SUPER accommodating. I told her we could do whatever she wanted. I was up for anything. I just wanted her to feel comfortable. Honestly, I just wanted to move on and get back to writing and having fun again. I was tired of the misery.\n\nSo that all got worked out, for the most part. We were getting along and everything between us \\*felt\\* fine.\n\nAnd then... like a seesaw, it was Seamus' turn.\n\nDina had the tendency to always have a problem with someone. She was extremely negative from 2020 onward, around the time the pandemic started, and it was a consistent thing that wore Seamus and I down over time. We both agreed to be patient with her, because the pandemic was making every body a little insane and that was understandable. I remember once 2021 rolled around, we were optimistic about her getting better. \n\nIt just got worse.\n\nEvery day she had a complaint about someone. She didn't like how x played their character. She was bitching about the ratio of m/m ships to m/f ships, then bragged about how many m/f ships she had and how she had \"the most\" (I actually had the most, but I digress). Her complaint about gay ships actually started making me feel a little uncomfortable, because it started sounding vaguely homophobic (I'm gay irl). I personally ship based off chemistry. Honestly, I can write any ship with the right player. The fact that Dina was complaining was also WEIRD, because she wrote m/m ships too, but for some reason it was \"okay\" when she did it. She would also  bitch about how her characters had no plots and would make no effort to create or participate in plots. I spent so much time trying to plot with this bitch, I stg. It was like pulling teeth. She'd drop characters and bitch about how no one paid them attention because they were women (not true), then pick new ones up. Then she'd bitch about OCs and how stupid they were. It was just... a lot of negatively. Constantly. And I am not a negative person, so it was really starting to get to me.\n\nMeanwhile, her attitude toward Seamus and I was getting worse. She tried to insert herself in plots we had and then want to change the plot because she didn't like any suggestion that put Seamus and I's characters separate from her character. I'd then change the plot to accommodate her, only for her to later want to change it all around again and feel a new type of way about how Seamus and I's characters were interacting within the plot. Seamus and I deferred to her so many times just because we didn't want the drama. So many of our ideas were ruined or taken hostage because we were wary of upsetting her or making her mad. We even let her be a \"plot admin\" so she could create her own plots in the game and feel important. Yeah. Idk what we were thinking. We were trying to make her happy so she'd chill out and just... stop being this negative force. She was like a fucking dementor. And behind the scenes, Seamus and I were encouraging each other to consider her side/point of view and to be adaptable. This is the part that's hardest to swallow for me. If I'd have put my foot down, I could have gotten us out of this horrible situation a long time ago. I didn't. I wanted to make things work, and so did he. We were CONSTANTLY giving her the benefit of the doubt and reminding each other that she was going through a hard time. \n\nWhenever Seamus shipped with ANYONE ELSE, she'd get jealous.\n\nWhenever Seamus brought in a new character, she'd hound me about whether or not I was going to ship with that character.\n\nSeamus and I dropped so many plots we had together because we knew that it would result in her feeling left out. We had to downplay the deep connections we created with our own characters because she was clinging to the bitterness of not being able to facilitate that herself. She wasn't even trying anymore. She just insulted and degraded everything Seamus and I were doing together and was actively trying to sabotage it.\n\nI didn't see this for what it was at the time. I just thought she wanted to be included. I was dumb.\n\nThen I got COVID. The week before I had to be hospitalized, I talked to her about how active she was in the group because I noticed that her activity was down. I asked her if it had something to do with the group itself since she had muse elsewhere (by her own admission), and she immediately got defensive. I told her that I wasn't blaming her for writing elsewhere, that wasn't my concern, and I just wanted to know if there's something \\*we\\* could do to help her muse. She calmed down and I thought everything was fine.\n\nThen I was in the hospital, terrified out of my mind, and she starts being... weirdly short with me. Then, out of nowhere, she ghosts me AGAIN and tells Seamus it's because of what we talked about LAST WEEK. So here I am, barely able to breathe, APOLOGIZING to this person for something I'd already apologized for and I thought we were past. Dina proceeds to ignore me for days for... Reasons. When she had COVID, I sent her fucking tea in the mail and checked in and even played SIMs with her to distract her from it, because I knew she was afraid. I felt incredibly hurt that she turned her back on me when I desperately needed support and even had me saying sorry for it.\n\nI let that go.\n\nAround this time she started saying that she was sex-repulsed and talked about possibly being asexual. Seamus and I were both supportive and adaptable to whatever she wanted to do. It was a little awkward when her feelings would change depending on the day. One day she'd want to talk about kinks and even sent me a kink survey, then the next day she'd berate me about our ship being too \"sex-focused\" and make me feel gross for a scene she instigated. This is the point when I started feeling uncomfortable writing with her. \n\nThen there was a scene that took place after a funeral where her character ran around, threw up behind a bush, and then wanted to jump my character's bones. She admitted to Seamus that she was \"horny\", so I suspect that motivated her, but knowing THAT and having to write opposite of her made me EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE.\n\nI never knew how to interact with her or what was okay and wasn't okay, or how she would feel about our scene the next day when she was in a sex-repulsed phase, and it killed any muse or desire I had to interact IC. But I still DID, because I knew it'd be a problem if I ended scenes or wanted to take it in another direction. \n\nSeamus was starting to have a hard time talking to Dina normally because of everything that had happened (and was still happening), so his interactions with her were not as friendly as they once were. They weren't mean or anything, they were just short and to the point. When she asked him why, he just told her that he needed a little space and that he'd be okay after that. \n\nMeanwhile, in character, her characters are behaving aggressively toward Seamus and I's characters and are berating them and starting PHYSICAL FIGHTS (like domestic violence shit), which is NOT in character at ALL. It was obviously just a way to lash out against us personally and it was very... intense and upsetting to deal with.\n\nSo, in the middle of all of this, we end up messaging another player that happens to be close to Dina. I'll call her Renee. Renee was close to Dina but not really close to either of us. I had no issues with her, but Dina seemed to think that Seamus had it out for her. Not really sure why. I think it was just wishful thinking. She realllllly wanted Seamus to be jealous of her.\n\nSo Renee hadn't been interacting with anyone else BUT Dina for a long time. Months. We went back on her blog and had to go back weeks and weeks before finding a thread that wasn't written by Dina. We messaged her and politely informed her that we didn't allow bubble rping and that she needed to branch out and write with more members. She told us that she wasn't \"inspired\" by the other members. We responded that this was a group roleplay and she needed to participate with the group. She said she understood and informed us that she would leave.\n\nDina lost her mind.\n\nShe went off on Seamus because he didn't \"let her have this one thing\" and blamed him for Renee leaving, when Renee was the one who wasn't following the rules. She immediately stopped speaking to Seamus in order to take \"time\" or whatever. Then she called me sobbing. I spoke to her for hours and tried to calm her down and explain that Seamus did NOT hate her or Renee or... whatever. I then messaged Seamus, beyond exhausted, and just asked him to please take care of this bc I couldn't deal with it anymore.\n\nAt one point, days later, I asked her if she could reassure me that she still cared about our own plots, which had been ignored for weeks (this is the second time I dared to ask for reassurance), and she simply refused to give it because she felt too \"overwhelmed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dina writes Seamus... a 16 page letter. I'm not even kidding. 16 pages. Like legit the Rachel and Ross letter but IN REAL LIFE. It basically outlines the changes he has to make in order to be her friend, completely negating his need for \"space\" and demanding that he interact with her normally. \n\nThe rest of the letter is... disturbing, to say the least. She admits being jealous of me and somehow this is news to both of us. Idk. We're idiots I guess. She also goes out of her way to compare them as people to the ship they're in, which really BOTHERS Seamus and makes him extremely uncomfortable (understandably.)\n\nBecause Seamus knows I'm upset and he also doesn't want further conflict, he swallows the whole letter and agrees to what she wants.\n\nSeamus then changes the fc for one of his characters. Dina has a meltdown and messages me spewing all of this hateful shit about the face he chose and how \"angry\" she is about it, while admitting she has... no reason to be angry. This REALLY unnerves me and I have no idea how to respond to it. To this day, I have... no clue why she was angry that he changed his character's fc without consulting her. I'm just? I'm fucking mystified.\n\nSeamus and I were both nearing our breaking point by now. We started talking about closing down the group and just doing our own thing with each other. We decided that if one more thing happened, then that's what we'd do. It was just getting out of control. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating, I was having health issues. Seamus was having migraines every day. It was starting to affect our day to day life. \n\nOf course the next thing happened exactly 1 WHOLE DAY later.\n\nIt'd been weeks since Dina and I had written anything. I decided I was going to try one more time to get a direct answer about what we were doing with our characters. Did she want to write the ship/plot or not? I wanted an answer.\n\nFinally she told me no. I asked her why she didn't say anything sooner. She told me that other people influenced how she looked at the ship (I'm assuming the new group). I expressed disappointment that someone outside of what we'd written had ruined it and asked her why their opinions on our plots mattered so much. She immediately started mocking me about how upset I was when Iris (the leader of the other group) turned against me. The way she turned it around on me was extremely condescending and cruel, especially considering the toll all of that took on me and the fact that she also ended up taking Iris' side (or claiming to).\n\nThat was the last straw.\n\nI told her that I was done. I didn't want to write with her anymore or talk to her anymore. I was going to be leaving the group. Seamus was asleep so I couldn't give him a heads up, but we had the previous agreement that if one more thing happened then we would be done. This was the one more thing. I was tired of dealing with her callousness towards my feelings. I was tired of giving her everything she asked for and not having any of my own needs met or even acknowledged. \n\nThe second I said I was done, she immediately told me how horrible and selfish I was to \"do that to Seamus\". It was very satisfying to tell her that Seamus and I had already talked about closing the game. \n\nThen that was it. I blocked her. I spoke to Seamus the next day and let him know what I was doing. I wasn't sure if he still wanted to leave or if he would stay, so I was careful about that part since I didn't want to pressure him either way. I also wasn't going to ask him to block or ghost Dina. That was his decision.\n\nDina had the audacity to rush to him IMMEDIATELY (like five mins after I blocked her) and offer to be co-admin of the game. She claimed I blocked her \"because of a ship\" LMAO. We had a good laugh out of that. PLEASE. To this day she probably tries to claim I left out of a reason that petty, but there was a LOT more to it. I never bothered laying it all out for her, though. It wouldn't have done any good. Dina's narrative is always the TRUTH, regardless of whether or not it has any validity.\n\nWe didn't tell the group the full reason for why we decided to leave the game, other than the stress of keeping the environment positive getting to us over time, because we wanted to shut it down on a high note. The plot had come to a natural end anyway. It was time. It was sad, because some of our members had been there for YEARS and we were all extremely close. I miss some of them a lot.\n\nNow she runs a game over on Tumblr with some of the old members of that group. I really hope that she doesn't treat them badly, because that's honestly my biggest concern. The fact that she's overseeing the same people she mocked and claimed to hate just.. makes me so nervous. I worry about them all the time, but I'd never interfere.\n\nSeamus did sever ties with her a few days after I did. We'd both just had enough. In retrospect, she really fucked us up. We had a lot of residual anxiety over everything that happened. It left us with actual trauma, I'm not even joking, because of everything we made ourselves put up with. The worst part was Dina insisting on talking to us about things that she knew were upsetting, just because she should have the \"freedom\" to do it. Having our feelings consistently and constantly dismissed was... terrible. I don't know how we let it get as bad as it did. It should have ended a long time ago.\n\nIn retrospect, things were a lot clearer. I guess they always are. There were red flags the whole time that we explained away or excused away. We gave her the benefit of the doubt when she didn't deserve it. We never told each other the extent that she talked badly about us to each other until afterward, and the duplicity that she had was just... unsettling. I've never known someone to be so cruel and hateful towards people they claim to love. How does someone do that? Like what is wrong with u.\n\nBUT -\n\nSeamus and I are so much happier now. We rp just 1x1 with each other and have reclaimed a lot of characters that had been ruined for us over the course of her... destructiveness. The positive thing I can take from this (and I hope he can to), is that the way we supported each other through it and afterward. It brought us much closer. We have been friends for over two decades and it's hard to imagine NOT talking to him every day. He's been such a strong support system for me and I can only hope I've been the same for him. We're able to enjoy rping again and we've written more in the time we've left than all the years combined with the group. I was worried I wouldn't be able to find muse again, but it's been seriously amazing. \n\nIf anyone actually read that whole thing, I'm astounded. It isn't even comprehensive. That's two years worth of insanity. Also I wrote it all in a matter of hours, so if it doesn't make sense or if there are any typos, I APOLOGIZE.",

            "selftext": "This may be a bit of a long one. Thanks for reading!\n\nThis happened last year when the lockdown was still in affect where I live. I had been temporarily out of work for a good three months and had decided to browse around the internet in search of potentially picking up new RP partners. Came across Reddit, set up my ads and waited for a bit. Ended up getting someone who wanted to do a sci-fi plot with me and I was super excited as I had the perfect idea. \n\nWe shared our media handles and popped on over to Discord where we exchanged characters references and got to know each other. To my knowledge, my ex-partner didn't have an immediate idea and I had explained what I had in mind and they were cool with it. I always, always encourage my partner to throw in their own ideas while we're doing a thread as I want their own input and I want them to have fun! And this was going to be a pretty cool thread as my character and theirs weren't going to be getting along with each other right off the bat.\n\nSo, just to preface this, I had my main OC and her team of, like, four other characters on top of the NPCs I'd be using later on in the thread that our characters would be interacting with. Thread continues on and the first thing my ex-partner did was take control of my one of my direct OCs. I never gave them permission and politely and gently explained to them that, hey, that's one of my characters and if they would like to, they're welcome to create their own secondary character. They seemed fairly okay with this and we pressed on.\n\nWe then get to the part where all of our characters are getting ready to leave the main warship and fly out to a colony world (where the rest of the thread would be taking place) and our characters are starting to pack up their gear. During this, I am making sure I include interactions with my ex-partner's singular character and my own when I then apparently neglect to write a single response that included interactions with their character and mine. They then PM me in our OOC chat in Discord and go on and on about saying how I am taking over the narrative and all that and more simply because I didn't include their character in one response and how I have all these characters of my own running around while they have only one. Needless to say, I was a little off put by this and should've dropped the thread right then and there as they pulled this stunt again later.\n\nI was actually worried I was inadvertently taking over the thread, which is the last thing I'd want to do, and had gone off to a few people I RP'd with in the past who said I didn't. I gave my RP partner plenty of opportunities to come up with their own secondary characters and add to the plot while I used my own OCs. My guess is that they didn't like how I called them out on trying to use one of my secondary characters who they thought was up for grabs. If they had asked first, I'd've been okay but the fact that they just immediately went head first into the thread and took over my character rubbed me the wrong way. Not to mention them accusing me of taking over the narrative by coming up with the plot idea on my own and using more characters than them despite me telling them they could easily do the same. I also wasn't going to be using the secondary characters all the time as I'd be falling back onto two main OCs.\n\nI've never had someone be so picky with me.\n\nAlso I'm totally fine with someone using a single OC in a thread but don't get your feathers ruffled when I'm using more than one or two characters at a time. Talk to me, don't get defensive. If you want to bring in more characters, go for it!\n\nTLDR: Ex-partner accused me of taking over a plot narrative despite me informing them that I'd be using a character who's part of team and not taking part in further the plot while they're only using one singular character the entire time.",

            "selftext": "[edited for clarity]\n\nI am piggy backing off my dear friend (and fellow admin) u/harlequinns series \u201ctales of an ex-admin\u201d to bring you another story from the group that the two of us ran together. The star players in this particular one are myself, u/harlequinns (who I\u2019ll be referring to as Zelda in this post), and a member that I\u2019ll call...Kevin. Here we go.\n\nSo, Kevin joined our group initially just before a fairly large and important event that we were planning. He brought in a character who is a powerful magic user in the canon and a former teammate to one of Zelda\u2019s main characters. We were excited to have this character, and immediately thought of a plot to include Kevin in the event. It seemed to go well enough, barring a few hiccups in communication that seemed perfectly normal with someone just coming into a group. The event happens, Kevin\u2019s character contributes her piece that helps, and all seemed well.\n\nKevin then goes on to create an OC (our group allowed both canon characters and OC characters). This idea was presented to us as a set of three siblings who were ALWAYS together, did everything with one another, and would not be separate. Think...the Three Witches from Macbeth. We agreed to allow Kevin to apply for these three characters on a single application since, to our understanding and their own explanation, they would be written more as a single entity in game. We had a 1 week wait time between character applications, and a 15 character limit in general, so by Kevin being allowed to apply on a single application he did not have a wait time and this entity of three siblings was treated as a single character.\n\nThis became a problem almost immediately. Upon acceptance, Kevin began writing the siblings as completely separate people. Occasionally all three of them would be used together in a thread, but it was far more common that they were written separately. They had their own plots, their own ships, so on. This was not what Zelda and I had agreed to and it was not the idea that had been presented to us. We would\u2019ve allowed all three siblings in game, but of course would have counted them as separate characters and required separate applications with the requisite wait time between. This, while annoying, was something that we were willing to chalk up to some kind of miscommunication rather than purposeful deception.\n\nKevin\u2019s OOC behavior in our discord started to become an issue as well. He started to become very passive aggressive (and sometimes just plain aggressive) if he didn\u2019t get responses quickly enough, or felt that he was being ignored. At one point, he changed his nickname in our Discord to something along the lines of \u201cThe Ignored.\u201d Zelda and I spoke to him from our admin account at that point, letting him know that we could not tolerate the passive aggressiveness, and that if he had issues communicating in Discord that he was not required to participate (it was optional at the time) as long as he kept an eye on our Admin channel in case we posted links or announcements. Since we operated on a two-strike system, we considered this his first strike. If we had to speak to him again, he would be banned from the group. This did result in a lengthy discussion between the admins and Kevin, who at first tried to argue the rule, but ultimately seemed to understand everything.\n\nIt was around this time that I started to hear rumors that Kevin was being aggressive with people in private DMs, mostly hounding them for ships. No one ever actually brought these concerns to us as admins, however, so there was really no action we could take about it. We didn\u2019t know at the time what was true or how much of it, if anything at all. There were a few incidents where something like this happened (not only with Kevin, but in the game in general), despite how often we encouraged people to bring problems to us if they were experiencing something that made them uncomfortable. Tragically, we were not telepaths and did not know about things if people didn\u2019t actually tell us themselves.\n\nAnyway - Kevin ended up having his characters unfollowed for poor activity. He insisted, upon being unfollowed, that he had sent us a message asking for a hiatus and we must have \u201cignored it.\u201d This, of course, was not true. Tumblr does sometimes eat Asks rather than deliver them, but because of that we always encouraged members to double check that we received their requests. There were several ways to do this, none of which Kevin did. Again, after discussing it with him, he accepted what we were saying and we were on the same page.\n\nUltimately, we allowed him to reapply (I know you may be thinking this was a mistake, but he technically only had one strike against him and no direct complaints at this point, so we were fairly following our own rules to allow him back). We did let him know that if he intended to bring back his sibling trio that he would now need to apply for each of them separately, with the wait time between. He agreed to do so.\n\nVery shortly after bringing back his original character and one of the siblings, the passive aggressive behavior began again in chat. It was a collection of comments along the lines of.. nobody from one of the game\u2019s major teams \u201chitting up\u201d his character despite the fact that she\u2019d been a major component in the most recent event, making a comment and then saying \u201cnobody bother to say hi I\u2019ll just leave,\u201d and remarks about nobody loving him. This time, Zelda and I logged the incidents with screenshots because we were tired of this shit. We always made sure to follow our own rules consistently, though, as we tried very hard to be fair admins (even to the Kevins of the world).\n\nWith our screenshots in tow, we messaged Kevin from our admin account and let him know that he was no longer welcome in the group. He had already been booted from our discord at this point, so thankfully was unable to continue messaging our members there. Of course, when we let him know that this was his second strike and he was being banned, this didn\u2019t go over well! Shocker! He didn\u2019t have much to say to us on the admin account, except that our decision \u201cwas a terrible one\u201d and that talking to us wasn\u2019t worth whatever long-winded response we gave him. Good riddance, we said.\n\nLess than half an hour later, a post popped up on the dashboard from his main character\u2019s account. It was a huge paragraph telling everyone that he\u2019d been booted from the group for no reason, and that the admins couldn\u2019t be trusted. I think the precise phrase that was used was that we were \u201csnakes in the grass\u201d and had never been his friends. Since we only posted account unfollows on the days activity checks happened (twice a week) everyone was still following this account and saw this childish TANTRUM on the dash.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see from Zelda\u2019s three-part stories she\u2019s posted on here, we did everything we possibly could to keep drama away from our members and out of the game. Kevin didn\u2019t really give us a choice when he decided to put up his little infantile rant. We had to address the group to let them know that we\u2019d had some difficulties with a former member, and that we\u2019d answer questions if anyone had them. Fortunately for us, we did have a lot of amazing, very supportive members at the time and they had our backs.\n\nAll Kevin did in the end was make a fool of himself and we were free.",

            "selftext": "Hello! Here to tell you some of my misadventures with bad rpers and my awful morbid persistence in continuing.\n\n**FETISH FISHING**\nSo, this guy popped into my DMs all of a sudden with the request if I wanted to RP. The first red flag I saw was that their account was literally barren save for one post about a thief being forced to crossdress by a princess.\n\nI decided to give them a shot because I was bored and my profile was also as barren as theirs is tbh. So, we get to talking OOC and things are great. I\u2019m getting along with them and we\u2019re having fun. Then we got to plotting. This man would barely acknowledge any of my ideas or pursue them any further. He literally only looked at one aspect (fantasy) and went \u2018we can do that\u2019. My stupid mind went \u2018maybe he has an idea he\u2019s really interested in? Let\u2019s ask him!\u2019\n\nHe then proposed to me how he really liked playing effeminate male characters. Okay, sure, sounds cool. Then followed it up by stating he liked the idea of a forced makeover. I got confused and asked him to elaborate. He basically told me that he liked having his male characters be forced into a dress or being forced to wear make-up. He even stated that he did not really give a shit about the excuse so long as his character gets to wear a dress.\n\nI went for the diplomatic way and asked if the plot did not matter so long as this aspect was in the RP (solely because I thought that was more polite than straight out asking *is this\u2026 is this a fetish thing?*). I think he backtracked and replied by saying that there should be a plot and that it shouldn't be wholly centred on this specified scene. So, I\u2019m trying to come up with a viable plot with this guy. And, again, this dude does not acknowledge nor does he add on to any of my fucking ideas which led me to believe that this was totally a fetish thing.\n\nI told him that aspect is okay so long as it serves a function for character growth and that my character doesn\u2019t force his character to crossdress because I don\u2019t want to deal with that. And he sent only one message that said \u2018Okay, that makes sense.\u2019 before ghosting me.\n\nI blocked and reported him soon after, because the site I was on does not condone 18+ content anywhere on it, be it in public or in DMs. And fetish fishing in a site where minors tend to roam due to catering solely for SFW is\u2026 ugh.\n\n\u2014\n\n**HONESTLY, THIS WAS MY BAD &amp; I JUST WANTED TO COMPLAIN.**\nThis guy keeps spamming his posts (it was literally the same post over and over, he posts the same thing at least once a day) and being the curious person I am, I decide to try them out and see why they can\u2019t keep any partners. In his ad, it was basically a copy paste premise of a military academy of a pretty popular RPG. First red flag: he wrote it down as if it was his own creation and not a fandom based RP. Sure, let\u2019s passively call him out on it on his post by commenting \u2018Hey! I\u2019ve played the game before and would not mind RPing it with OCs.\u2019 He liked the comment and soon hopped into my DMs.\n\nBut aside from that, his post is fine. He has pretty reasonable rules listed down and specific wants like his partner to play female characters and that they have an anime-esque face claim. He also specifically wanted **a partner who actively contributed to the plot.**\n\nSo, we talked and I tried to plot and work with him on my character. The keyword here is *tried*. He never answered any of my questions regarding how the RP would work because it was literally an all OC universe- it was technically an AU at that point so I couldn\u2019t hundred percent rely on the knowledge I had on the fandom. He kept rushing me to finish my OC but would literally not answer any lore questions I had when all I wanted is to nicely fit my OC into the universe. He would either outright ignore my questions or just dismiss before asking for my OC. To which I would\u2019ve said \u2018yeah, she\u2019s almost done but I just want to about x and x?\u2019\n\nAnd the cycle would repeat.\n\nI got annoyed so I decided to divert the topic to plotting what was going to happen or how we were going to start the RP. I asked if he was cool with that and he said \u2018yes!\u2019\n\nSo, I asked about some lore stuff and gave some ideas on how to start. I also added some questions about the mini-character creation he added on his post, mostly about character abilities because the fandom he based the plot from had a fixed magical system. Surprise, surprise, he completely ignored any of my attempts at plotting but got confused about one question I asked about the mini-character creation he had. \n\nThe question was asking for clarification on a term he used on picking a magic type (he used the word \u2018magical companion\u2019, which honestly made no sense). He got confused and asked me where he wrote that. I told him where and even sent him a screenshot to prove that I wasn\u2019t lying or making it up.\n\nDo you want to know what he did in the end? Ding, ding! Fucking ignored the question.\n\nThe only reason why the RP even continued was because I asked if he meant that question to say to choose a specialisation in the magic choices he had already given. To which he then replied \u2018yup!\u2019\n\nAt this point, I kind of get why he doesn\u2019t have any RP partners and is constantly fucking spamming the same ad over and over again. But do I dip out like I should\u2019ve? No, I kept going. Why? I don\u2019t even know why. I keep asking for more world info so I can finish my character lore\u2013 he ignored me and only replied back when I sent in my finished character OC.\n\nHe then sent his and his character was literally the main character of the series reskinned as a self-insert. His self-insert was so fucking bland, I knew he was expecting me to play a god damn harem. My brain is telling me *this is trainwreck, what the fuck am I doing wasting my time with this guy?*\n\n\u2026 I kept going. But I didn\u2019t get very far after that. I kept asking about the lore and kept wanting to plot. And then he answered back by saying \u2018honestly, I\u2019m really bored and just want to RP right now.\u2019\n\nFine. Let\u2019s RP. I have no clue on how to fucking start nor do I know the specifics of the plot because he refused to answer my questions. So, I told him he should start. He agreed before asking me if I have any RP rules or triggers.\n\nHe then asked if I was okay with ERP. In his post, he never specified that he wanted ERP nor did he ask for anyone that was 18+. The site I was on had a lot of minors and was specifically for SFW RP and did not allow ERP in public or in DMs.\n\nI left the chat and then reported him.\n\n\u2014\n\n**COPY AND PASTE**\nThis one is the most nonsensical one in my opinion.\n\nHe approached me for RP, specifically for my childhood friends prompt. Sweet, sure let\u2019s go. I\u2019m very excited because that prompt was very detailed and I had a bunch of ideas ready to throw at him and wanted to see what he could come up with. He obviously did not read the prompt in full and got confused midway of plotting (the setting was during medieval times and he repeatedly kept saying things like high school, phones etc). Afterwards, he repeatedly kept saying that he hasn\u2019t RP\u2019ed in awhile so he\u2019ll be rusty. Whatever. My expectations were lowered immensely so I didn\u2019t expect much but a casual semi-lit to one liner RP. And to keep things simple for him, we just went with what literally was a high school musical plot but you minus the musical and add the childhood friends aspect to it. Basically, our characters were childhood friends that were separated before having a chance encounter during the summer vacation and reuniting again in a new high school. To add on, this was entirely his idea and I just agreed to it.\n\nI sent my starter which was longer than planned but whatever. I told him he doesn\u2019t need to mirror my length and asked if the starter was okay. He said he loved it OOC. He doesn\u2019t reply IC for a whole week. I nudged him for a reply and he did, very badly, disregarding the plot as discussed because his character acted as though my character was a stranger when we agreed during plotting that our characters were supposed to recognise each other from having met during summer vacation. I asked him about it and he confessed that he got confused with another RP. I told him that\u2019s fine, we can start over but that he\u2019ll send in the starter this time and he replied with \u2018Okay\u2019. After some time waiting he sent a question mark in OOC. And I reminded him that he agreed to send in a starter instead of me.\n\nHe sent the starter. It was very bad. This dude literally copied and pasted my starter word for word and then stole my whole female character concept (a geeky and unattractive girl who recreated herself into an attractive girly girl for her high school debut) and turned it into his male character (also word for word, he just changed the pronouns from she or her to he and him. So, his character was this pretty curvy boy with long luscious hair which I wouldn\u2019t have minded if he didn\u2019t COPY my starter/character intro). The way he sent the starter out was weird too\u2014 a paragraph per message. So, before he stole my character concept, I messaged in the middle of his starter asking him if he was copying and pasting my starter and asked him to not do that. But he ignored that message and continued on regardless. By the time he finished sending the starter, I left the chat and blocked him.",

            "selftext": "This is something that has happened to me, quite a few times. Whenever I am role playing with someone who is a little more confident, and outspoken than I am. The sort of person who just puts their ideas on the table without any sort of hesitancy, especially if it's for something related to my side I always get this kind of really bad internal anger.\n\nIf my partner has ideas for their side that's all well and good. I don't mind that because it is their side.\n\nHowever, when people give me ideas for my side which I don't ever ask them to do and one of their ideas is very similar to something that I was already going to mention I get peeved horribly.\n\nFor example let's say that I'm doing a superhero roleplay, and I have a few ideas for a power in mind and one of the powers I'm considering strongly is something like telekinesis.\n\nSo, I let my partner know that I have a few ideas I'm considering and haven't really decided on which one I like yet. If my partner responds to me by listing off say 20 different powers and one of them is telekinesis I will now be really upset by it. Now I feel like if I mention I want telekinesis as a power that because they put it in writing first I'm stealing their idea.\n\nAnd most of them are nice people. They will usually try their best to reassure me that I don't have to worry about it, and they won't consider it stealing or anything like that.\n\nI appreciate the kindness, and the understanding. However, it doesn't change how I feel. If you give me an idea for my side and it sounds like an idea I already had I'm just now feeling like I cannot use the idea even if I genuinely had it in my head first.",

            "selftext": "(New here, so I hope I don't break any rules)  \n\n\nBefore my first experience in Roleplaying in general, I know next to nothing about it. My only exposure to it was only the memes and screenshots about the \"cringe roleplaying with the creepy asterisks\" kind, and mentions and references of DnD on the internet.    \n\n\nThe gateway to my new experience of internet RP,  and also where I met my current internet friends of today, is when a friend that I met in a guild in an old Japanese mobile gacha game, specifically me and him are in the same group chat years ago, invited me to his friend's group chat. He had shown one of my short stories to his friend who is already GM'ing a group RP on the group chat, and he liked it because of my exceptional writing skills.  \n\n\nI had used that group chat website back before that, but never really used it much due to me having a hard time navigating it and I had little to no friends to relate to in that site before it became popular. I had shown interest in doing an RP, because I think it would be cool because it is related to writing, which is a discovered talent that I had been cultivated.  \n\n\nAn important detail is that back then, I have only a handful of people that I can truly call friends, and I had severe depression and anxiety, with a combination of constant bullying and me having little to no ability to relate to people and making long-lasting relationships, which conditioned me that toxic behavior is normal because I had not experienced people treating me decently, and even then I had found it weird when people treat me like an actual person.   \n\n\nI was invited to the group chat. For anonymity, all names mentioned are altered. Since this story takes place years ago, many minor details may be lost on me.  I was in the group chat,  and introductions ensue. I also found out later that my friend for a decade was also on the group chat by coincidence. The friend who had read my short story document, Friend AK, was the GM of the ongoing group RP. An important detail about him was that he liked to start arguments in the general chat, was arrogant, and he is proud of being an asshole in general, and has a \"protagonist-syndrome\" as I liked to call it because he looked down at all of us. To be fair though, he has actual irl accomplishments and we were a bunch of losers, but I won't go into detail for the sake of anonymity.   \n\n\n Additionally, he would kick me from the gc repeatedly, the new person of the gc, and invite me again for the \"lulz\". That should be an immediate red-flag, but due to being desperate for friends, I had to bear with it. Although he was only a moderator, he had challenged the owner of the group chat, Friend KR. He was rude and condescending among our friend group, berating some of us.  \n\n\nHis first RP has finished abruptly due to some \"*complications*\". From what I can remember, Friend AK forced Friend KR to make his character interesting, and overall he is railroading the RP, and making the players feel like side characters. The ending was the characters get killed by a god if I remember correctly because he ran out of ideas.  \n\n\nThe second (and final) RP was where I joined. We were promised a Borderlands-inspired setting and my original character concept was a teenage boy who can go berserk and uses his fists to attack. To be fair, that was OP, and so Friend AK scratched it and I removed that ability in exchange for having mutated-fists because I like the \"Bare-Fisted Monk\" archetype.   \n\n\nWe made our characters, and we were 7 of us, with Friend AK as the GM.  The introduction of the RP was us getting our ass beat. Especially mine, because to be fair, punching rock-creatures with your fists isn't a great idea.  Our characters were saved by his \"DMPCs\". This is excusable since we were the recruits, but it is not fun when at the end of every battle, his DMPCs will save us.  Additionally, instead of us freely RP'ing, we were forced to follow the story down to our own dialogue that he will dictate in dms, and rarely we were made to rp with ourselves. Although we were promised a unique setting inspired by Borderlands, what we got was an unoriginal amalgamation of Arknights and The Division. The thing about his RP settings is that they are obviously unoriginal and plagiarized from video games that he liked.   \n\n\nThe whole thing was generally unfun because I would describe his RPs as a \"visual novel with us as custom NPCs\". We were given no freedom to act our characters even within the setting, and instead, we were forced to be side-characters to his unoriginal story.  Thankfully, it ended with me and the friend that invited me to the gc to make another gc, him as the owner and me as main admin. Friend AK had entirely left the RP unfinished because of his addiction to an MMORPG FPS sci-fi game, and the members of that gc trickled down to ours which we starved him out for attention, and we left the gc dead because overall, we do not like that person because he is an asshole outside of the RP. Eventually, we sometimes forget that he exists, and we were only reminded of his existence when he either pms one of us, or seeking attention in one of the gcs that we are in.    \n\n\nDespite these, there were moments of fun, even tho it was minimal at best, which inspired me to create my own campaign. I learned from my first experience in internet group RP on what *not* to do when you are the GM.  \n\n\nNow I have a campaign and a oneshot finished, and an ongoing one using my own homebrewed system based on a setting that I had built for many years in daydreams even before meeting them. To add closure to that RP, my friends' characters had cameos in both of my campaigns. Generally, along with many bad experiences, that horrible first RP experience had made my life better because I had learned from them.",

            "selftext": "In most roleplaying forums where you can maintain a personal profile and have a friend's list, I think it's a general, unspoken rule that the person who sends the friend request also sends the introduction. 50% of the time, you get people that never talk to you or interact with you in any way. They just collect friends like Pokemon cards. 40% of the time, it's people that send obvious greetings that they copy and paste from a template or something,that is more often than not, a couple of paragraphs long, that they'll just send to every person they add. Only about 10% actually introduce themselves and show a genuine interest. It's honestly annoying and a tad frustrating sometimes. If someone can't even be bothered to at least say 'hello' or 'Hi! Thanks for accepting my request' or whatever, it makes me feel like they wouldn't have enough time, or wouldn't care to devote enough time, to crafting a story at all anyways. And I'll usually just ignore their ''message'', or outright delete them. I'm sure I probably come off a certain way with this, but I just had to get it off my chest.",

            "selftext": "Ok so let me just explain what I mean by passwords. They're just randomly inserted sentences clearly stating a word that someone should send me in their first. Like I'll be talking about the inspiration for a fantasy race I make and then suddenly there will be a sentence like \"Please send the word \"Rain\" in your first dm to let me know you read this far and you'll get priority\". This is mainly because I do very plot heavy posts and will even state that in the flairs if possible. \n\nBut, on this occasion I did a particularly story heavy fantasy rp post. And after nearly all of my posts I do an INFO section which explains things out of character and gives a little more plainly stated exposition. And it's in the first or second paragraph in the INFO section that will harbour the password. And that's what I did. The first section of the info section had a password, but then I needed to include masses more information, particularly about the two characters I would play in this RP. Essentially they were two sizable character descriptions. And then I posted another big paragraph about characters the reader could play. And that's when I inserted a second password. My genuine intention with all this was to place those who gave me both passwords as the main priority, those who only gave me one as the second priority, and those who gave me none as simply not deserving of the time. \n\nNow I'm not asking if having passwords Is a dick move. I will ignore your opinions if you think passwords are snobbish and demeaning because they let me know I am dealing with someone who takes RPs seriously. What I'm more asking here is about a recent choice I had with this post. See, someone DMed with only one of the passwords, no big deal, but, I also had (as I do in every single rp post I ever post) a clear list of numbered information I'd like to have in the first dm. Such as the gender of their character, the sort of character they'd like to play, if they had a preference for which character I'd play, a list of kinks and limits, and a preference for third or first person writing. NONE OF THESE but the gender was given by this applicant (and strangely she even gave me her age which just wasn't asked for at all?). So, even though she gave one of the passwords, I didn't respond because she didn't even give me the answers to the highlighted questions. Am I the asshole for that? \n\n**This is the actual post I'm talking about. Read at your leisure*\n\n\n\nFor years now, the Empire has pressed its glutinous claws into every kingdom, queendom and mass of land it deems worth owning. Through brute force, political poison or a mesh of the two, they've taken, conquered or burned so much. Pushed so many out of their homes unless they slay them down with it. And in this dark tavern, in this cow shite of a town, two victims of the Empire's endless hunger seek refuge. Some kingdom's have been able to hold their own against the Empire, some haven't. Some still openly fight the Empire. And by the look of their skin, these two gentlemen seemed to come from such a land. Gesh was a land famous for their people's hard work and incredible mastery of technology. They were truly ahead of their time. Geshen men and women were famed to be anything from fantastic tinkers and designers, to incredible lumberjacks, miners, and hard labour workers in general. Their brown skin and fine hair, often braided, gave away their appearance. Including these two men huddled in the dark of this Tavern. A tavern in a town a long way from any Geshen city....\n\nGesh openly denied any charge or rule from the Empire and refused any alliance. Which resulted in an army being sent on one of their three main cities. Tride, a coastal city. Though, coastal didn't mean warm. All Geshen cities were renowned for being balls to the walls freezing. Anyway, the Empire formed some ridiculous propaganda about the people of Tride forming an army, so the army conveniently had an army prepared to head to Tride in pre-emptive preparedness. The Tride people were *so* ready for a fight and *sooo* well armed in fact, that they quickly rushed their elderly, unfit and young out of the city and used their fastest forms of transport to head them off to their closest sister city. If the locals stood and fought against the Empire's army, then they'd be officially labelled as violent enemies. So, the able bodied men and women stayed back, and quickly, painfully dismantled anything of use or value or anything that could be used agasint others as a weapon. The people of Tride had to disassemble their own home and could only take what designs they could carry. And as they set off.... the league of Tridemen were attacked. Mercenaries paid to attack whoever was left in Tride as they were closer than the Impirial army. The caravans of men and women were scattered and told to flee. All to find their own way to either the closest city or to their true capital if possible. And that's why there are two very clearly Geshen men in this tavern. Locals of Tride, escaping and making their own way to find their own people. Actively avoiding any men of the Empire and any mercenaries paid to hunt their kind down.\n\n**INFO**\n\nHey there! Well done on making it this far! Essentially what we have here is a fantasy world on extreme civil unrest as an overbearing Empire conquers its way around the place. And the two characters I'll be playing are two men who herald from a race of skilled labourers and creator's. For some reference, their tech looked very steam punk and their cities are very industrial but not in a very oppressive way. Their technological know how doesn't cost them any social injustice. And their comfort with winter, appearance, like for thick clothes and sense of community makes them a lot like the water tribes from ATLA if they were more industrial and heavier on darker colour tones in fashion. This next sentence is a secret password for those still reading. Comment \"Rust\" in your first dm to get ahead of the pack. Anyway, these two men are actually VERY different from each other but work well together as opposites in these trying times. And who exactly are these men? \n\nName: Loca Prain \n\nGender: Male\n\nAge: 20\n\nSkin: Light brown \n\nHair: Black, only just long enough to be tied back.\n\nEyes: Amber \n\nHeight: 6'\n\nBuild: a swimmer's build \n\nUsual outfit: black trousers with suspenders, finely polished brown leather boots, a white poet shirt and a knee length, navy blue coat. Always wearing spectacles.\n\nAccent: upper-class British \n\nOccupation and Skill Set: expert in fire arms. On both the practical and design level, Loca is superme in the area of fire arms. From rifles to pistols he can tinker, alter, destroy and improve most guns in a few seconds if need be. But he isn't all just a mechanical nerd. He's a stunning shot and no one knows whether his glasses make his aim better by much....\n\nPersonality: professional, decent and collected. He's a man of class, even in these times of high stress. \n\nName: Kova Nicklash\n\nGender: Male \n\nAge: 23\n\nSkin: slightly darker than Loca\n\nHair: Black, braided in one tail and nearly reaches his waist \n\nEyes: Dark blue \n\nHeight: 6'10\"\n\nBuild: Boxers build \n\nUsual Outfit: Black leather pants and boots, a sheepskin coat. \n\nAccent: a more working class British accent. \n\nOccupation and Skill set: a bit of a drifter back in his home. He was a Hand for Hire. Meaning he specialized in a few areas and took work for a good enough pay. He's qualified in mining, lumberjacking and even fishing. \n\nPersonality: a little gruff with an intimidating appearance but he's far more friendly when you get to know him. Although, neither of these men are really sociable these days.\n\n\nI can either play both of these men equally or play one in particular if you prefer one to the other and wish to have me write first person. You can be absolutely anyone you wish! Incase you were wondering, tiefling, goblin, faun, elf, fairy, anthro, dragon, dwarf, oni, halfling, human, i have no concern or preference on what you play. Be what you want. Vampire, demon, werewolf, firbolg, orc. Any fantasy race you wish, you may have. Any class or occupation as well. Academic wizard, cold and calculated assassin, bold and strong barbarian, a monster hunter, black smith, ranger, perhaps even another Geshen. (Here's a second secret password to reeeeally test your dedication. Please send Rust and Iron in your first dm to get full priority). the list goes on. \n\nSimply create your character, come over to these two Geshen men trying to figure out where the hell they're going, and let the journey begin! \n\nIn the first dm please send;\n\n1. Your character's gender.\n2. The sort of character you wish to play.\n3. A ref or description.\n4. List of kinks and limits.\n5. Your preference on me predominantly playing one or both of these men. \n6. Your preference for third or first person. \n\nLimits; sounding, vomit, shit, ridiculous amounts of gore (but pain and violence to an extent is fine).\n\nKinks? I won't be able to remember them all but.... public sex, loud, rough, hand jobs, risky, slapping, biting, hair pulling, slurs and insults, raceplay (preferably heavy for this setting and time period), non consent, affecionate, powerplay, collars and cuffs, Foreplay, edging, teasing, foot jobs, whips, bite marks, knife play, cum play, rimming, porn logic, being deep throated and reciving cock and ball worship, mind breaking, post orgasm torture, multiple orgasms until left quivering. Unless specified otherwise all of these go both ways and all of these are optional. \n\nI am a switch especially for Futas and dominant women.\n\nKik= JumpyLantern\n\nDm for my discord.\n\n**I am +18 and all characters and participants must be +18**",

            "selftext": "After a years-long hiatus, my first venture back into the world of RP was a F4M historical romance.\n\nI'll call my partner Happy, because he was really chipper, and also quite sensitive. I accepted Happy as a partner because his writing seemed really good at first, but as the RP went on it became apparent to me that although he could write well on a technical level, everything his character did was illogical and immersion breaking for me. \n\nBy illogical I mean things like this: at one point our characters were escaping a burning galleon in the lifeboats. He described his character cutting one of the ropes holding up the lifeboat... but there is a second rope holding up the other end. If you cut just one, the boat is going to tip, but the way he described it was this boat continuing to hover in place patiently waiting for *both* ropes to be cut.\n\nHe also missed many details in my posts. For example, when I introduced a side character and called the character by name several times, he started calling this character by another name. He constantly seemed confused in actions scenes about the placement of the characters and the end result was that it felt like his characters were teleporting around to hit mine. Sure, this could be my fault. Maybe my descriptions suck and that's why he was confused. But, based on the fact I never had this problem in any of my past RPs, I tend to think I was not the problem here.\n\nThen there was his OC, who my character was supposed to fall in love with over the course of an enemies-to-lovers arc, but he was so offputting that it was hard for me to feel any positive feelings for him at all. You see, his character was a slave owner who ran a plantation. Although he secretly sympathized with the abolitionist movement, he publicly whipped his slaves. My character was also an abolitionist who was initially only pretending to befriend him so that she could steal some documents that would help her free other slaves. After this \"betrayal\" is revealed his character constantly harped on mine that her betrayal was just as bad as him whipping slaves, and OOC it seemed like my partner agreed with his character's viewpoint.  It just really grossed me out and I could never, ever see myself romancing this dude. I was looking for a nuanced story about someone coming to terms with the evil they had committed, expecting some kind of character growth from him but it was all so flat and 2-dimensional. I could tell that he was trying his best and didn't realize how much of a knob his character was.\n\nUnfortunately I kept the RP going on for far too long... probably six months or so. I was really enjoying writing my own posts, but I abhorred reading his. Everything he wrote was illogical nonsense that I had to find a way to resolve, like the hovering boats, and when he finally asked me \"how much longer before your character falls for mine?\" I realized I could not proceed.\n\nI am ashamed to say I ghosted him. I should not have. None of his bad was intentional, and I did call him out on some of it OOC. He took my criticism very well and he attempted to fix it, but in all honestly he just didn't have the ability to write the kind of story I was looking for.  Doesn't mean he was a bad roleplayer, just not a good match for me. And I know I was a shithead for ghosting but I just couldn't bring myself to tell him the truth about how I felt. I feel very sad about the whole situation when I look back. I should have gotten out of that RP way sooner instead of wasting so much of his time on something I knew I wasn't enjoying.",

            "selftext": "Ok yall help me out here. I've just been banned and even muted from a certain RP sub for the post I'm about to show yall. Now I was already banned from this sub once for posting my contact information. A ban I fully accepted and worked to avoid in future and I was doing really well. But now apparently I've been absolutely, thoroughly, irreversibly banned for what you're about to see. Why? Because it was \"vague\" and didn't clearly articulate the sort of rp I was going for. \n\nPost in question;\n\n**[M4AplayingF/Futa] Spooky Season fun with a bunch of neck biters~**\n\nIn the spirit of Spooky Season I'm in for something fun, light hearted and with a dash of fantasy and 90s/80s holiday shenanigans. Ever seen the 80s film The Lost Boys? Or ever seen Vampire Masquerade Bloodlines? Similar vibes.\n\nThis is the sort of rp to let loose and enjoy some youthful freedom with a bunch of rebels, outcasts and odd sorts. Goths, punks and alts galore! The sorts that are attracted to off limits areas, stay up until the darkest of hours, and create their own world of fun and games among themselves. The setting can be 80s or just modern if your prefer. \n\nEssentially my character will the leader of a bunch of vampiric, vagabond youths. You could be a local witch, vamp or werewolf of a town my little bat army strolls into. You could be a new addition to the gang or a more familiar member.\n\nOr alternatively, you could be the rebellious, fun seeking biker vamp coming to town, meeting a shy and reserved witch boy who I'll play~\n\nI have options for the type of member of the gang I can play, so do ask if you wish to pick for yourself. And on the note of starters, I had the idea of this all being kicking off during a Halloween Festival and we lock eyes as we realise our appearances aren't exactly costumes.... If you decide you like this idea here's what to do in your first dm to me in reddit chat.\n\n1. tell me which character you'd like to play.\n2. Show me a ref pic or description of character.\n3. Tell me the gender of your character.\n4. Tell me the sort of setting you have in mind\n5. List kinks and limits\n6. Preference for third of first person writing \n\nLimits; sounding vomit, ridiculous amounts of gore (but pain and violence to an extent is fine).\n\nKinks? I won't be able to remember them all but.... public sex, loud, rough, hand jobs, risky, slapping, biting, hair pulling, slurs and insults, raceplay, CNC, affecionate, powerplay, collars and cuffs, Foreplay, edging, teasing, foot jobs, whips, bite marks, knife play, cum play, rimming, porn logic, being deep throated and reciving cock and ball worship, mind breaking, post orgasm torture, multiple orgasms until left quivering. Unless specified otherwise all of these go both ways.\n\nI am a switch especially for Futas and dominant women.\n\n**End of post**\n\nNow tell me what the absolute fuck is wrong with with? I've given time settings, character ideas, setting ideas, themes, even referenced other pieces of media as inspiration. Is this really so bad to deserve a perma ban? I'll gladly show off other posts I've put on that sub that were accepted If I so need to.",

            "selftext": "I've been searching both here and on F-chat for a bit for ERP in some of the more niche kinks I'm into, kinks not shared by folks in the RP discord I'm part of. To say its been going poorly for the last few months is an understatement. Now seems as good a time as any to document some of the issues I've had. Of note: Keeping OOC and IC separate is a big thing for me, and I RP only in third person for the sake of my own comfort. \n\n1: when making any kind of ad where I intend to play a female character of any kind I have been inundated with creeps who don't understand the concept of OOC conversation and exclusively RP in first/second person who want to use me as a vessel for their breeding fetish. When I tell them no to anything they just vanish. Listing breeding as a hard no in every ad has caused responses to stop altogether. (Note: having breeding as a hard no on an f-list profile did not stop any of them)\n\n2: The only response I ever got on my fandom ad was someone who knows nothing about the fandom, let alone the character I wanted to play.\n\n3: for some kinks, no matter how hard I attempt to specify that I want to play a submissive role I will still get pure subs trying to get me to dom for them because they like the ad I wrote up and want to play the role I wrote for myself to play.\n\n4: when writing a prompt with 1 or more kinks I consider mandatory for RP off it (since I wrote the prompt to find other people who do them), no matter how hard I specify I will always get people who want to drop one or more of the listed kinks. \n\n5: It takes at least 4 days to find someone who wants to respond to any of my ads, including people with the previous problems (minus problem 1),  and when they do its almost always people who either A: try to force other kinks on me or B: will offer a one line response after asking me to start and getting a 2 paragraph starter.\n\n6: A lot of people seem to not understand that I dislike weird out of character comments (such as calling me, the writer, a 'cutie' or just assuming we're automatically friends because we RPed once) even after I ask them to stop. A lot of these people also vanish when asked to stop. Seriously, though, how hard is it to call me by my username? I'm Tatters in most places, this isn't hard!\n\n7: Every halfway decent partner or group I've found via reddit and f-chat have ghosted real hard or crashed and burned respectively.\n\nTo this end, I'm giving up. There are also some more specific examples of bad RPers, of course, but this general list would be enough for me to just stop even without those examples existing.\n\nAnd no, I am not seeking recommendations for RP servers/platforms/subreddits, not that anyone here would likely provide them even if I was.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m in a fairly large discord rp server and I\u2019ve had a lot of fun on it for the most part. However, I\u2019ve begun a roleplay that\u2019s just really starting to annoy me.\n\nSo nearly a week ago I pinged the roleplayers as a request for a roleplay. This girl replied, and made it very clear from the start that she wanted a romantic roleplay between the characters, which I was fine with. (Her character was a more \u2018idgaf brutally honest\u2019 type, mine an awkward and nerdy type.) So the roleplay starts, and everything is going well, but it\u2019s becoming so unbelievably frustrating. We have been rolaeplaying for at least two hours everyday and all her character seems to do is relentlessly bully  and pick on mine (it\u2019s supposed to come off as lovable and charming, but it\u2019s just not), be flirty and suggestive, and whenever my character does any of that back she immediately shuts him down and acts like he was being in appropriate. What makes it worse is that her character believes she is always in the right. There is no development or getting through to her, she never admits that she\u2019s wrong.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the rp partner messaged me ooc and told me that her character wasn\u2019t the type to make the first move, and that I\u2019d have to. I was fine with that, I tried and tried but she seems to shut down any romantic tension I try to make. I even got my character to kiss hers, and it happened but her character just continued on after like nothing happened. The roleplay is just becoming a bunch of small talk and meaningless conversation between characters, because she doesn\u2019t initiate or follow through with any major plot points and it\u2019s so tiring.",

Was odd. \n\nOne of them I dropped because this person was talking to me like I was their best friend constantly about everything and the randomest things when we'd just met for the business transaction that IS roleplay... In which they weren't responding because suddenly they had a lack of motivation which is fine (just personally if there's no responses in the BEGINNING of a roleplay I tend to lose mojo ESPECIALLY if we're not talking about the roleplay ooc). But they were telling me everything about their life and I just wasn't there for it. Too bad too. The plot for the rp was sick. \n\nAnother one is one I have going! Quite like this person too. I don't mind some personal ooc chat just about life. We're past (kinda) the beginning stages of the rp and tend to on and off talk about the characters so everything is cool. Until they let me know in weirdly oddly disgusting detail about their menstrual cycle... describing it as... Leaking. And I just messaged them like \" lol bro chillax \" because I mean I for one: wasn't expecting it and two: just I don't wanna know about that stuff? Especially from a random person off the internet. \n\nSo I wanna know y'all's thoughts on personal conversations ooc and when it goes to far and what do you do? What's your thoughts on ooc chat in general?",

All your doing is singular sentences and I feel as if I'm doing all the work with no real payoff. Not to mention you expressed interest in playing out a Pokemon adventure but then decided to just skip 1/8 of it.\n\nThem: \"Your replies were hard to work with\"\n\nMe: No they aren't, I'm not one of those people that ramble on and on and on about a character's emotions and inner thoughts without giving something the other person can use to progress. I kept everything nice and simple, I don't like overly complex.\n\n\"They were hard to work with\"\n\nMe: How?\n\nThem: \"I had a hard time responding\"\n\nMe: \\*looks at post times, they usually post 1-2 minutes after I replied for the rp\" Uh huh.

            "selftext": "1. Recently I posted an ad for a relatively obscure prompt as far as sfw goes, so anyone who took a bite for it, I accepted. Well, in conversation about what we wanted with the RP he made things a touch weird. The conversation \\~relatively\\~ follows as such. (H for Him, M for Me)  \nH: \"So do you have any turn ons?\"  \nM: \"Like intellectually?\"  \nH: \"Yeah, like I like for younger female characters to call my character daddy.\"   \nI then reminded him it was a sfw prompt. He responded with \"I know\" then suggested for our two characters to have an obnoxiously large \\*romantic\\* age gap. To which I denied, but they kept pressing for. They continued to tell me my character should wear pig tails as they found it sexy. Once again, this was a sfw rp. \n2. When I was first getting back into rp after a few year long hiatus, I did so via fandom. Without going super in depth, let's just say this fandom was super happy go lucky, rp just for a spirit boost. This character and I are having a lovely conversation about what it means to help people and then out of the blue he says, \"you want to know something about me? I have killed people. Many people.\" \n3. I recently asked to plot out some basic plot points with someone. She got so up in a tizzy that I dare ask to work on a bare bones plot before the RP starts that she blocked me.\n4. Finally, one of my favorite RP occurrences. When you ask for literate rpers and you get a response. They have a great character bio so you don't bother to ask for a writing sample. You write a 10+ paragraph starter and they respond with 3 discord mobile lines. You give them another chance, it happens once more. Then they get mad when you ask to discontinue.\n\nI am sure I have plenty more, but oh boy does my brain hurt from the amount of sense these fellows have.",

            "selftext": "Here I am again! \n\nI have a few more stories to add!\n\nFor those of you who didn't see my first post, I was an admin on Tumblr for over five years for the same RP. I won't be giving away the name of that community here, but if anyone is curious enough to ask, feel free to DM me. I won't be using any real names here for the sake of keeping things private. \n\n1.) First story isn't too bad. I'll call this player Dawn. She was nice at first, but it wasn't too long before we started to realize that she was a bit... overly-sensitive, I'll say. I'm sure some of you have had experiences with writers like this. She would take issue with the way IC interactions were going and message us OOCly, defending her character's actions and saying that our characters were mean or unreasonable. Basically she blurred the lines between IC and OOC. It got a little frustrating, especially because she'd be upset at me for my character being an ass when my character is literally a villain in a comic book. Similarly, her feelings for particular players would affect how she interacted with them in character. She wanted a m/m pairing with her main character, which is fine, but then when someone joined as that character's love interest, she went out of her way to state that her character had ABSOLUTELY NO FEELINGS for them and NEVER DID. They were also extremely rude to that person and their character when there was absolutely no reason to be. \n\nSo a lot of issues with her were managing conflict between the other players, because she would (of course) quickly offend people by behaving this way. Eventually she left the roleplay, but we remained friends because I was always very polite and respectful to her even though she was frequently in the wrong. I would be firm, but kind. \n\nAfter she left, I ended up picking up the character she wrote for the most. She messaged me instantly, EXTREMELY offended that I would do this because that was HER character. I told her that if she wanted to return, I would give the character back to her. I meant it, too. She declined.\n\nA WHOLE MONTH LATER, she messaged me and asked to come back and to have that character returned to her. By that time, I'd already created plots with other people that I was excited to play out. I even had a ship in the making. I explained that the offer I made wasn't a standing offer, it was one I'd made at that time because I thought she wanted to come back immediately. She BLEW UP on me, calling me a liar and a bad admin, and... yeah. That was enough for me. After being so understanding and offering a listening ear for all the times she was upset, I was pissed af that she was going to treat me that way. I was no longer her admin, so telling her to \"fuck off\" under no uncertain terms was very satisfying.\n\n2.) This story is a lot less clear cut. In fact, I don't consider myself completely blameless in this story, either. The admin that ran the game with me is on this subreddit, so if he has anything to add, I'll let him do so in the comments, because we were both around when this went down. \n\nThere are a few players in this. The first one I'll call Kyle. Kyle was a new player, BRAND new, and he started off pretty thirsty to ship. I'll also state here that our roleplay was 18+ and didn't have a lot of triggers listed. Members were responsible for submitting their own triggers to add to the list. There were no rules about what could and couldn't be discussed, either IC or OOC, and the separation of character/player was evident (so I thought.) \n\nOOC, he was fine. He got along with everyone in the chat and was very kind to everyone. All around affable kind of person.\n\nHis character was an OC and pretty much the whole \"brat\" stereotype. He was also VERY flirty and would hit on other characters and make a lot of sex-related jokes. This didn't bother me specifically and no one else commented on it. Since we were 18+, this type of behavior wasn't breaking the rules. It just made for a bit of a messy OC. This person otherwise had wonderful plot ideas and was very good at carrying them out. They were also polite OOC and never pushed for anything. \n\nWell, behind the scenes it was a whole different story.\n\nIris was one of our long time players. She was very sweet and kind, I liked her a lot, but she also considered herself to be the moral compass of the group. I knew she was put off by his character because of how she responded to him in the OOC chat. This didn't particularly surprise me, as this player would often take on \"questionable topics\" and insert what she thought the \"right\" thing was. I didn't always \\*mind\\* her doing this, but sometimes it did rub me the wrong way. As an admin, I always encouraged people to express themselves independently. To a POINT. I never want other people to feel uncomfortable in their interactions with others, but I'm not going to police interactions and check in with everyone all of the time either. If someone does have an issue with an interaction IC and they aren't comfortable handling it themselves, then I'm happy to step in - but they also must bring it to my attention. I'm not always going to know those things.\n\nLittle did I know, behind our back, Iris was going to each member individually and talking to them about Kyle. Behind the scenes, she was slowly gathering a whole group of people who didn't like how he wrote and took issue with the suggestiveness of his posts. The other admin and I didn't realize this until we were bombarded with anons (and non-anons) with identical complaints and lingo. As admins, we handled the complaint and spoke to Kyle. Kyle was embarrassed and quickly agreed to fix the way that he was writing his posts so that people would feel more comfortable. We told him to not hit on characters unless he had permission to do so first. He agreed and (I thought) all was well.\n\nWe continued to get anons. Not only that, but Kyle wasn't being treated well in the group chat in spite of the changes that were made, and it was starting to concern me. I wasn't necessarily concerned for KYLE, but I was worried that something might have happened that we didn't know about.\n\nBecause I knew all of this started with Iris, she was the one I messaged first. She told me that Kyle made Brandon uncomfortable and \"pushed\" a ship onto him, and she felt responsible for speaking up for Brandon since Brandon was scared to come to us. This SERIOUSLY alarmed me. I immediately went to Brandon and reassured him that he could talk to me about this, his feelings were important to me, and everything we spoke about was confidential. Brandon told me he had no idea what I was talking about and that Kyle had never made him uncomfortable. He said that he felt pressured by Iris, but that everything was fine. A few more members told me this same thing: they didn't have an issue, but Iris was messaging them and pushing them to send an anon to us about it. \n\nSo... this bothered me. While I DO understand having an issue with someone being too suggestive in their posts, the fact that Iris was taking it upon herself to create a posse instead of coming to us herself was very troubling to me. Not only that, but things she was telling me didn't match with what the members were telling me. I want to stress that I had no personal connections to Kyle. None. He'd been in the rp for only a couple of weeks, while these other members had been long-standing for months. The only thing Iris ever complained to me about was his writing ability. She was a bit of a snob about that, which I later suspected was the real reason why she wanted him gone. She also hated OCs and thought they were all horrible and shouldn't be allowed in the game. Although she was only a member, she clearly had a certain idea of how we should run the game, and when (and if) we made a decision that she agreed with, she was quick to praise us as \"wonderful admins!\" But if we did something she DIDN'T agree with, it would be radio silence. \n\nNot only that, but she was continuing wage a campaign against a member we'd already spoken to and who had already changed his behavior. It was creating a bullying atmosphere that I was not on board with, especially because a lot of it was happening behind our (the admin's) backs. \n\nI spoke to her again, simply telling her that she needed to stop and leave Kyle alone. We'd taken care of it. We spoke at length one evening - I actually thought the conversation went rather well . I even apologized for upsetting her with the discussion, because I know confrontation makes her nervous.\n\nIris and I had a few other minor disagreements. One of them was over relationships and what constituted an \"appropriate\" age gap. She was trying to educate members on what was okay and what wasn't, while knowing there were a couple age gap relationships in the game (between adults, of course) that didn't fall under her \"rules\" for what was okay. The player she was speaking to, Jessica, was playing a character who was \\*physically\\* 21ish, but in all actuality was a teenager in years, and having a relationship with someone that was... pushing noncon, but I guess was dubcon, since they were being manipulated by hormones. I told Iris that she didn't need to be commenting on character relationships that weren't her own, especially because other problematic elements existed within the game. It was our job as ADMINS to handle these issues, not her.\n\nA few days later, she left the RP. She took a few members with her, and the formed their own \"literate\" rp that didn't allow OCs and was extremely strict when it came to writing ability. There were also a lot of rules. I wish them luck with their game, because - in my opinion - admins should be able to run their game any way they like. Our game was a bit more open and flexible, because that's how I prefer to write my own characters. It's supposed to be fun. We just couldn't conform to what she thought a \"good\" game should be like, so she took herself elsewhere. \n\nBut she COMPLETELY turned against me. She called me toxic, said I \"made her heart hurt\", and completely blocked me everywhere. This devastated me, because we'd been close friends (in my opinion) and only clashed on occasion. I never thought less of her and had no idea that I was \"harming\" her to this degree. I've always been a straightforward, direct type of person, and never considered that this could be intimidating to others. \n\nIt was a hard lesson I learned about myself and how to approach issues with future members. All in all, this situation has a lot of grey area, and has more to do with different ways of handling a game. I just wish that Iris had been more open and honest about things - both with Kyle AND with me - because I did respect her opinion even when I disagreed.",

So my humble request would be to provide me with tips, such that we can avoid the pitfalls and make the RP a good one, probably not resulting in ghosting or  without an end to the plot.\n\nI cannot say for others, but for me, I am not a born role player nor am I a writer. Whatever I am at this stage, which is minimal compared to most role players, is from literature in the internet and inputs from previous partners enabling me to work on my skills.  The journey has been arduous but fun nonetheless. I know there are still many areas I need to work upon and improve.\n\nSo I take this opportunity to ask the netizens, what tips would they  give me, from their personal experiences , to become a good role player. A good writer, with enough skills and mastery over the English language to adapt myself either to fantasies, sci-fi, slice of life , NSFW or any genre thrown at me. How do I become a literate , advanced literate or even novella?\n\nMy current writing style oscillates between literate and novella, though it is nowhere perfect.  Since I use Discord, my replies at times go over 2000 characters and if situation demands , have found them to go over 10000 characters also! \n\nI like to build a good background  story to my character, talk about their present and in italics, dish out their thoughts. Conversations are included in punctuation marks and in italics. In my post I try to describe their  surrounding and reaction to the senses of touch, smell,  taste and audio with a healthy dose of adjectives thrown here and there.\n\nMy focus has been to build a great narrative and RP\u2019s with a definitive ending. Thus I prefer to have the storyline divided into scenes.\n\nAny guidance from your end is welcome!",

            "selftext": "  \n I have a server I've been running for a while. Years actually. I got this friend in it who is a really great writer. Honestly, they're amazing. At first, I was super jealous because I was used to being the \"best\" writer in the server, but once I got over that and just accepted her as someone who could inspire me to be better, and to try harder, things were good. I promoted her to Mod and that was chill.   \n\n\nBut things just started changing and I can't pinpoint where exactly the change came from. I used to love researching and planning new things for my characters and tinkering with graphics and all that jazz. But she was just better at everything. I'd figure something out, then in a week, she had it figured out and was doing it better. I don't know if she did this on purpose or if it was that she was inspired by me so she'd do more? Maybe? But it felt like nothing I did was ever good enough.   \n\n\nOver time, this story I'd put my heart and soul into just felt like work. I got super depressed and lethargic, so I'd sleep all day if I could and wake up to a long list of problems she had noticed that I needed to fix. I had this character who was like a government official type that used to plan big events that I would spend weeks researching for, because it was fun for me, but then she got a character that was in a similar role and she started doing all that too but blowing all my shit out of the water. Then she'd show up in my scenes and her characters would ask a million questions from a place of genuine interest, but it just always left me feeling like I didn't do enough.   \n\n\n Research stopped being a thing I took joy from. I didn't want to plan any more events because she was just always disappointed and questioning and making me feel like nothing I did was ever enough.   \n\n\nI know that a lot of this was just be being insecure. I knew I had no right to ask her to dial her creativity back, so I tried not to, but it still spilled out as I got more resentful. So in an effort not to hurt her feelings, I just let my muse die. My writing became significantly less inspired. I was just writing to hit my required activity for the server. Everything felt like work.   \n\n\nAt one point, I was thinking that I'd just plan my character's exit strategies and give her the server because she clearly loved it and clearly could manage it better than I could. I just wanted out so badly, but we had/have players who loved the story as much as I did and do, so I didn't want it to just close because I felt the noose getting tighter. She refused, so I felt stuck. It was like my options were to close it and disappoint everyone or stay on and continue disappointing someone I really cared about.   \n\n\nWe had a fight at one point and a big falling out. She quit the mod role but stayed in as a player, but she did so with this addendum of like \"I'll stay but you need to change for all of these reasons listed.\" At first, I tried to change. I was heart broken that she had quit, but I was also feeling lost because by that point, it had been at least a year of me faking my muses, going through the motions, and hoping I got my muse back.   \n\n\nWe stopped talking and in time, I slowly got back into it. My hurt turned to resentment as I realized how controlled and judged I'd been feeling for years. For a bit, she was backseat modding through someone else, and my resentment grew. I teetered between knowing how much she had done for me while she was a Mod and how pointed everything she had done since quitting felt. So, I stopped trying to change for her and just started looking at the story and thinking \"I don't love it here anymore. How do I change that?\" And I started making changes, getting it back to its original concept, making it more the story I wanted and less the story she'd made.   \n\n\nShe didn't like that much. More commentary kept reaching me second hand through the rest of my team. I scrapped most of the stuff she had complained about, but I was also not forcing the story into a direction that benefitted just her characters anymore. It became really obvious to me that aside from one or two players who really just loved everyone, no one really wanted to write with her. She'd start scenes and no one would join them because her characters had made themselves so unapproachable. Not only that but a rumor started circulating that she was telling some people that she felt other players were just terrible writers. The moment it was clear she wasn't in power, I got so many people messaging me, complaining about how uncomfortable she made them because she judged their writing so much.   \n\n\nThese aren't bad writers by far. It's a literate multi-para to novella server. Yeah she was great, but so was everyone else, so hearing about this was really upsetting. Finally I'd just had enough. I told the other three in my staff that the next time she complained or threatened to leave, to just hold the door open for her. As far as I was concerned, she'd just outgrown us. Hell she'd probably been too big for us from the start, and the worst thing I could have done for my server was think I could make room for someone who needed that much content generated so constantly to stay relevant.   \n\n\nI maintain, she is a powerful writer. One of the best I have ever seen. But *God*, it felt like she had a choke-leash on me that had been getting tighter and tighter over the years and everything I did was just defensive strategy, trying to get a little more air. So finally the day came that she hopped into a mod's DMs to vent about her latest frustration and the mod just point blank asked \"if you hate it so much, why stay?\" And her response was essentially that she felt entitled to staying and it was our job to make it a hospitable place for her. That we weren't allowed to say that we cared about our players at all because we so obviously didn't care about her.   \n\n\nAnd that's maybe the thing that pisses me off. I know her side because she gave me a laundry list of everything I'd ever done wrong in her presence, collected through the years and pushed through a filter that didn't put any accountability onto herself. I know where and when I've messed up. I'm not a saint. I'm not a victim. It's been a growing process throughout. But she blatantly ignored that I've been destroying myself and sacrificing the story I set out to write, for her, for years. I just couldn't do it anymore. So yeah, I prioritized myself over her. Sue me. She didn't want control of the server, that was her call, but she left it up to me and I'm gonna run it the only way I can, which means taking back control of my muses.  \n\n\nSo she left. We lost her and one other writer, with 8 characters between them. But we carried on. Honesty, I wasn't sure we'd make it. But I went to sleep that night and I was stunned to feel that for the first time in years, I was actually relaxed and not dreading having to wake up the next day and chase down some new goose. The next day, we were more active than ever.   \n\n\nActivity stayed up. It's stayed consistent, every day since she left. People don't feel like they're being judged for what they want to write anymore. I don't feel judged for what I want to write anymore. We're all having so much  fun. More story is being written, people are making more content for their own characters and reaching out to others more. I hadn't realized how much control she had over the whole server just by being there, whether she spoke or not. Everyone was walking on egg shells with her there. Everyone was afraid of her, even me. We all were constantly feeling like we just had to live up to her impossible standards, and when we couldn't, we already felt bad, and she'd swing back around to call us out on our failings, always so politely, so \"I just want to help\" but it was still a nail in the coffin.   \n\n\n  I feel bad writing this and just acknowledging that for as amazing, as phenomenal, as brilliant of a role player as she was, she just made everyone miserable. I fooled myself into thinking \"I'm just insecure, but she's helping me become a better writer.\" No, I'm already a damned good writer. I love the content and the stories I generate. It's okay that I swing between Novella and Multi-Paragraph writing based on what I'm writing. It's okay to post one paragraph, it's okay to post 18 if the mood strikes me. I didn't have anything to prove to her, and neither does anyone else in my server.   \n\n\nShe did so much for us, for me, and I am so grateful for that. But God, she also just made me so miserable all the time because I couldn't live up to her. It's a hobby that's meant to be fun, and I felt like I was ten seconds away from exhaustion hitting and drowning under what she needed from me.   \n\n\nIn hindsight, and I guess in closing, I just feel like this wasn't her bad and it wasn't mine. It was just that she is too big of a writer - which is amazing - for my small server. And that's okay. And I wish her the best. But after everything, I'm also very glad she's out of my life. I just want to put all this behind me.",

Profanities. Yes, really. The memes about how English swears just don't have the same badassery Slavic or Spanish swears have exist for a reason. In English it's for the most part some pretty simple variation of the world \"fuck\" and a few derogatory words and that's really it. Not all of my characters swear like a sailor but some do, and in case of these I really miss my native Polish. Funnily enough for the most part I actually prefer writing dialogues in English, and the profanity territory is the one major exception, though there are a few minor ones.  \n2. TIME ZONES. Oh my god. Time zones were never an issue while roleplaying in Polish, but tough luck when it comes to roleplaying in English. it's able to work around it but I've found myself in situations where I needed an info for the post but the other person was asleep (or something else to that effect) and couldn't just finish it.\n\n3. A bit more minor one, but diminutives. In Polish it's far easier to make one up without having to use additional words.\n\nThere are some minor ones as well, but for the most part I still prefer roleplaying in English.

            "selftext": "This guy had an ad up on r/Roleplay and it was super interesting. In Reddit DMs, he was nice, friendly, and we liked the same things, so we moved to Discord. His pfp showed a very white guy with the eyes covered and a lewd word written above the head. Okay, whatever. Interesting choice, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. We started talking about ourselves. He asked what race I was, and I responded that I am Asian-American. He said that was fine, and that he was white. Cool. \n\nWe started talking about the RP. He requested that my character was \u201cwhite or mostly white\u201d. I was a bit thrown off, but I chalked it up to maybe it was because I\u2019m mostly white and therefore don\u2019t have experience playing other races or something, which would be reasonable. \n\nWe started talking a bit about politics (we are in the USA). I don\u2019t consider myself on either side (Republican or Democrat) as I hold briefs on both sides with exceptions. (For example, I don\u2019t believe the police should be defunded, but I agree that there should be a reform.) The guy responded that it was a good idea to be politically neutral, then followed it up with \u201cPersonally, I lean heavily on the side that hates N-\u201c and cut himself off. \n\nSince he didn\u2019t finish the word, I hoped it was one of those poor taste jokes (like when children say \u201cI\u2019m gonna say the N word!\u201d and then say \u201cNecrophilia!\u201d and think that it was funny) so I said \u201cNiall Horan? Me too.\u201d (No real hate to Directioners, of course.)\n\nHe then said, \u201cJK.... but not really.\u201d At this point I was quite uncomfortable, and I said \u201cI\u2019m kidding too. I don\u2019t even know Niall\u2019s favorite color.\u201d\n\nHe responded, \u201cI\u2019m talking about &lt;N slur&gt;.\u201d Except, of course, he actually said the slur. \n\nI blocked him. Didn\u2019t explain why or tell him I was blocking him. I probably should\u2019ve blocked him even sooner. I\u2019m just glad the RP didn\u2019t even begin.",

They post the same exact ad literally everywhere in every rper server every few days or so, and yet they are the most notorious ghoster I've ever heard of. Honestly, what frustrates me now isn't just seeing the ad, but hearing about them from every other rper I write with. We'll be chatting and they'll say 'ugh I just got ghosted after like, 3 responses', and I swear, half the time, it'll be this 'buck' woman again. How tf are they not banned anywhere!? I have yet to meet one person they haven't ghosted, but I know a good dozen they have.  \n\n\nLook, I understand ghosting perspective to a degree. If someone is giving off weird vibes, you're sick or no longer interested- it happens. Life happens. But they \\*chronically ghost everyone they come into contact with\\*. It's ridiculous. It's stupid and petty. It's been happening for \\*years\\*...And I realize I'm only giving buck the attention she probably wants my making this ad, but it's also disheartening to know that there's such a massive troll out there, and nothing we can do about it.  Except spread awareness maybe? Guess that's why I'm posting this.",
