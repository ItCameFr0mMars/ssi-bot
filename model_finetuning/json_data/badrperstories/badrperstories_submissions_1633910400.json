            "selftext": "I own an 18+ RP server on discord.\nI originally started written RP because I wanted to be more confident in writing adult scenes. Getting feedback from a small audience of adults seemed like a good idea. I never had an interest in it for my own pleasure. We know what kinds of users those are.\nI always stated this before any scene, that it was for practice/feedback, and got the reviews I wanted. They were mostly positive/good enough/indifferent. That's fine. I then moved on to plotlines and bettering character development.\n\nIn January 2020, the old owner left and dropped ownership on me with zero experience as a moderator. I took control and rebuilt the server from the ground up, crash coursing myself in everything discord along the way. It was a disaster and I fixed everything myself. Everyone follows the rules, usually. There is also a strict ID verification protocol in place (voluntary or leave) so adult users are safely allowed to join. It is an 18+ only server after all.\n\nIn the background, there was an overarcing story with the userbase/staff for a plot. That is the only RP reason that I even considered remaining as owner and putting the work in to RP. Sadly, that plotline has long since faded away with the turn of 2020/2021. Most of the server is either in their private messages (so RP rooms appear dead), or are sex/violence driven, etc. While I do look elsewhere for character development, having to watch over this feels . . . beneath me and like a waste of my time devoting any little effort to RP there.\n\nI'm not perfect. Noone is. However, this is the background for my choice to leave owner/admin status after almost two years. Sure, they consider me a friend and someone with high morals to keep the server secure, resolve issues fairly, etc. On the other hand, it is sincerely depressing and I no longer have the drive to even try with it anymore. I haven't devoted any real character development for my own stuff there since the end of 2020.\n\nI have tried to retire my main characters, but was met with guilt trips. \"But we has a story. What about my character? What are they supposed to do?\"\nWhile I said nothing, I quit running RPs because it had no lasting changes/growth potential and just went in circles. I deliberately let my own arcs die off. That's on me and I know/accept that.\n\nI ran Hellish and fantasy-military based characters. They wanna get stuff done, not chill with yours, bang, and chat like they've been doing as per requests. This has been made apparent numerous times. I also dont want to write the entire plot/setting solo. It's one sided as Hell and not fair, IMO, as a player. I've just been 'going through the motions' and doing my 'job' as lead admin of maintaining it for the last 8 months (since Jan 2021). I haven't even bothered to ask for new plots since everything has pretty much went so far from what it once was.\n\nI know that I noone needs to demand time or feel entitled to it. RP is a hobby. People have jobs, get busy, play games, etc. But its been 8 months of stagnation now and it has really worn me down. I want to quit/retire but dont really know the proper way without my absence causing it to tear itself apart. I'm the stern/asshole but fair type of moderator. Noone else usually assigns punishments to members to keep them in line.\n\n\nTL:DR, because I probably rambled way to much in the above.\n\nI've mentally checked out as a server owner.\nI want to retire from admin status/leave.\nDeleting the server is not an option. That isn't fair to the community.\nI don't hold malice towards the community.\nI don't know how to properly leave without causing drama or a scene, but my patience is slowly thinning.\nNo, it isnt going to make me quit RPing (maybe), but I feel this is sort of RP related so here y'all go.",

            "selftext": "So there was this one girl I was in a group chat with, who we\u2019ll call Audrey. I\u2019d never personally roleplayed with her, but I knew people who had. She was honestly just\u2026so self-absorbed and could be a bit too sensitive sometimes since she would take some things too personally and just blow it up in her mind to be a bigger deal than it was. She also had friends and even followers who would constantly jump to her side in things even when she was also at fault or even just endlessly defend her when she didn\u2019t need it\u2014they would lash out at the people who were \u201cagainst\u201d her, which I feel just added to her sense that she was always the victim.\n\nA few honorable mentions of things she did:\n\n\u2014 Had no issue shipping OCs who were only 18/19 with grown adult characters who were like, professionals in their field (think people upwards of being in their 30s, or even just mid to late 20s) but then had an issue with shipping 17 year olds with those same adult characters, which is just some flawed logic. I brought up once that even if 18/19 year olds are legally adults, they weren\u2019t mentally adults and were not at the same level as, say, adults in their mid-late 20s or older, and Audrey just defended herself by saying it was technically legal, so it didn\u2019t matter. (Which, *yikes*. If her defense rests on a technicality like that, it\u2019s not a very good one tbh. Just because something is *technically* legal doesn\u2019t make it right or okay to do. And like, just because someone is 18, that doesn\u2019t automatically put them up for grabs for older adults.)\n\n\u2014 Audrey came to the group chat all upset and acting hurt because she\u2019d been comforting a friend of hers who\u2019d had a fight with someone else they considered a friend. Basically, she\u2019d been comforting this friend by saying stuff like \u201cOh you deserve better, just forget about them [your friend]\u201d and when they told her, \u201cI know you\u2019re just trying to be nice and I\u2019m not trying to sound mean or anything, but you telling me all these nice things isn\u2019t really helping me feel better,\u201d she went complaining to the group chat and said they \u2018snapped\u2019 at her. \n\nAlso, Audrey didn\u2019t say this outright, but she was generally acting like her friend was just being ungrateful to her, because she went to the trouble of talking to the person her friend had fought with and even gave herself a panic attack over it or something, or at least that\u2019s what she claimed. She literally even said, \u201cIf people want to talk, they can do it themselves. I\u2019m not even going to bother anymore.\u201d Also when I told her that not everyone is comforted by being told nice things when they\u2019re upset, she was just like, \u201cBut they hurt *my* feelings, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about right now,\u201d which was honestly like\u2026WTF? She chose to do something nice for her friend by being the middle-man/mediator between them and another person they fought with, and she has the audacity to come in and complain about how *they* hurt *her* feelings??\n\n\u2014 Someone else in the group chat (we\u2019ll call them *J*) was talking about how they were uncomfortable with the way &gt;!Hollywood deals with and portrays sex!&lt; because it\u2019s often so upfront, as opposed to when you\u2019re talking about that sort of thing in a private chat where you can control how you\u2019re talking about it and to what extent. Audrey and the rest of the group chat (minus me, I wasn\u2019t even awake when it happened) went and called J \u201chypocritical\u201d for saying that because J had spoken about sex in the group chat before. They were all basically just repeating the same thing and weren\u2019t even listening to J trying to explain what she meant. \n\nAudrey and J left the chat over this, though J later returned because she felt bad about how she reacted because she got upset. J even felt the need to apologize to Audrey and Audrey\u2019s friend who I\u2019ll refer to as E. Audrey later vague-posted about this incident, and when J responded to the post, Audrey and E acted like she wasn\u2019t \u201cusing her head\u201d or whatever. In the post, Audrey claimed that she was leaving her group chats because she felt left out, but had posted this not long after what happened with J went down. So it wasn\u2019t exactly weird for J to infer that Audrey\u2019s post was about what happened in our specific group chat. Audrey had also said in a reply to J that the post was \u201cabout *me* and *my* feelings, not *you*,\u201d as though J was somehow trying to make it all about themselves even though all J had said in response was, \u201cHey, I mean, if you felt left out, you could have talked to the group chat about it. I literally never saw you say anything at all, and when you did, it was always with the same two people. I also felt like a black sheep in the chat, but I don\u2019t think it warrants leaving after what happened between us.\u201d\n\n\u2014 She would frequently be annoyed about how everything supposedly turned into a debate even though things like\u2026never did lmao. At most, it was a couple of messages, but never a full-on debate or argument. \n\nFor example: once she brought up &gt;!someone writing an RPF (real person fic) about Tom Holland\u2019s younger brother being trans, even though as far as anyone knows, he isn\u2019t!&lt; and everyone was like \u201cWhoa, what? That\u2019s crazy,\u201d and we talked a little about how weird it was that someone was writing about a real person\u2019s identity as though they were fictional, especially when that person was still a minor. And Audrey just came in like, \u201cNot everything has to turn into a conversation or a debate in here y\u2019all,\u201d like she didn\u2019t just drop something in the chat that would of course spark a conversation.\n\n\u2014 She also acted like we all hated on the stuff she liked in the vague post she made about leaving her group chats. In the post, she claimed that whenever she talked about the stuff she liked, it would just get torn down or made fun of, but in the group chat I was in, we never did that, not to the extent she claimed. Literally the most any of us ever said was \u201cCool, I feel like this thing/this famous person is a little overrated though,\u201d or \u201cI personally don\u2019t like this, the fandom doesn\u2019t really know how to act sometimes/can be really toxic,\u201d which was hardly us tearing her interests down or making fun of them. \n\n\u2014 She was also a writer, and she would complain a lot about people asking about updates. Which is fair enough, that does get annoying to deal with if it\u2019s constant. But on the other hand, at the time I still interacted with her, she had nearly 100 stories published that were all interactive stories where people had their own characters as part of the story, and most of them were never really updated past the prologue or first chapter. A few were never even updated past the cast list. Some even hadn\u2019t been updated in so long, that some of the people who had characters in the story had deleted their accounts since it was last updated.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s one thing to be annoyed about people asking after updates when it\u2019s your own story that no one else is involved in. But it\u2019s another thing entirely to have *other people* literally have their own characters in the story, never really updating after one actual chapter, and then turning to complain when people ask about updates.\n\nLike one instance I can think of is when one person was like, \u201cWhy is it that you publish so many stories but don\u2019t really update? It doesn\u2019t really make sense, since your attention is so spread out and that makes it harder to keep up with all the stories,\u201d a ton of Audrey\u2019s followers started saying variants of \u201cHOW RUDE, IT\u2019S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHEN SHE UPDATES.\u201d Again, yeah, an author\u2019s update schedule isn\u2019t exactly anyone\u2019s business especially if they publish online. But I also feel it kind of is if the story involves other people besides yourself.",

I'm using my alternate account which I use for my..... self physical amusement. \n\nI met a potential roleplay partner here on Reddit. I messaged them and we agreed on the plot, platform, tense and Pretty much every detail...... except my partner didn't mention that they might just, straight up ignore notifications from Discord if they are engaging in their other hobby, gaming. Now I understand that people who game can get hyper-focused or hyper into their game and forgot everything else, but this person was like clocking in four to five hours on The Sims 4 and not saying anything. \n\nWhen we first started the rp, I got four good and consistent posts from my rp partner. After that consistency was gone! My partner will have discord open, be playing games which I can clearly see under their discord name in dashboard and not give a shit about me messaging them to talk ooc. I'd try \nto talk ooc to hint at moving the rp forward but my partner would not even notice that. I have since split ways with said person and I'm looking for new partners. Today.... Just a few minutes ago, I see a post from my ex-rp partner who has made a post very similar to the one I responded to looking for an rp partner but, this time they've mentioned that they have no object permeance and will forget they have logged into discord. I'm just a little upset that they didn't care to mention this when they made such a post last time. Could have helped me understand.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve returned with another story from the group mentioned in the \u201ctales of an ex-admin\u201d series u/harlequinns started and I added to. This occurred PRIOR to me becoming an admin of that group, so it\u2019s a little different. It also happened a few years ago and is quite old compared to some of the other ones. \n\nThis tale involved myself and two other players. One I\u2019ll call Delilah and the other will be Leah. When I joined the group, Leah had already been part of it for a little while. She played two characters, one of whom I knew and the other I wasn\u2019t terribly familiar with at the time. She also happened to be quite a good writer. We wrote together occasionally, but not often. Leah isn\u2019t heavily involved in the beginning of this but will reappear later. \n\nDelilah joined the group a little later on, after I had been there a couple of months. She and I wrote together frequently, and we talked OOC a fair amount, too. The character she joined the game with originally had quite a few connections to a few of my own, so when she quickly began to pick up other connections related to my characters I didn\u2019t find it terribly strange. Within the superhero genre, at least in my experience, when people tend to love one particular team/family they end up collecting various characters from it, so nothing seemed amiss. Delilah and I ended up playing a few different members of the same canon family. \n\nIt was at this point that things started to get a little odd. I mentioned OOC one day that I have a silly little ship for one of the characters in that family. It isn\u2019t canon, as they\u2019ve never met in the main timeline and only once (off panel) in an alternate timeline. The ship also isn\u2019t really a thing in the fandom, either. It was essentially just a personal anecdote I shared with Delilah. \n\nWell, within a week of me mentioning this, she picked up the other character involved in the ship - someone she previously didn\u2019t know and had never expressed interest in. I found this to be a little uncomfortable, because of course she had done it in an effort to write that ship with me, but without asking if I was interested in her doing that. Still, I thought maybe she believed that by me mentioning it at all I was hinting for something. I hadn\u2019t been, but it could\u2019ve been an innocent interpretation. We hadn\u2019t had any issues yet, so I thought\u2026okay, I\u2019ll give it a shot. I told her that we could write them together and see how it goes. I try to never promise people ships or anything long term up front unless I\u2019m absolutely confident it\u2019ll work, so I didn\u2019t want to get her hopes up. \n\nAt this point, we return to Leah. Leah was a great writer, and after having been there for awhile I approached her asking if she\u2019d be interested in picking up a new character. In the canon, this person happens to be the ex of the character Delilah wanted a ship with. She\u2019s a character who I never encounter people writing within the fandom, but I really wanted the connection/dynamic she has with my character because of their shared history. \n\nI thought Leah would be a great person to play her, because she fit in well with the two characters she already wrote. I messaged her and asked if she\u2019d ever consider researching/writing the character, and she seemed flattered that I\u2019d thought of her to ask. After a couple of weeks, she did end up picking up that character. Like I\u2019d figured, she was great at writing her! Woohoo! \n\nLeah and Delilah started to become friends OOC around this point. This was meaningless to me at the time, because\u2026why would it matter if they were friends? Good for them. Of course it ends up being important later. \n\nThings with the ship Delilah and I were trying out start to not go well. She began pressuring me to write ERP. I don\u2019t mind writing ERP, and up until this point had not been bothered by doing so at all. Her character started really angling for it, though, even after one occasion when my character flat out said no. She also engineered something during an event to ensure that her character got injured (by another character she plays, no less) and had a kind of fit/breakdown when my character didn\u2019t care for her/devote attention to her in the way Delilah wanted it to go. She messaged me OOC and asked me, if I were in her character\u2019s shoes, what would I do? I responded that it didn\u2019t really matter, both because I\u2019m not my character or her character, and because we are writing\u2026superheroes in a fictional world. But I digress. Things were tanking pretty quickly with the ship. \n\nAround that same time, for whatever reason, Delilah began rapidly picking up other characters who were connections to mine. She would ask me if I had ships I liked for them, and if I didn\u2019t give an answer (which, given the mess I felt one of my characters was already in, I had stopped doing) she would pick up either a character from their canon ship or a popular fandom ship. It was like she was just throwing people at me hoping I would want one, but all it really did was make me feel more and more put off. (This was a behavior I\u2019d later encounter again with Dina, from part 3 of the Tales, so I might just\u2026be a magnet for it, which is disconcerting.) Her characters also started to display jealous tendencies revolving around a few of mine. \n\nOn the other hand, despite all that was going on with Delilah, I loved the dynamic I had with the ex that Leah was writing. I started to think I\u2019d rather pursue that instead of continuing the ship with Delilah, which I had only ever agreed to on a trial basis. \n\nBefore I spoke to either of them about what I was thinking, I picked up an additional character. I had never written this particular one before, and I was very much still in the learning process of figuring out all the comic history and everything. My portrayal initially was film based. This character happened to have a romantic history (not in the films) with one of Leah\u2019s other characters, but that is not why I picked up the character. \n\nLeah messaged me and asked if I wanted to pursue the ship between my new character and hers. I told her that I\u2019d be happy to include it in backstory/history, and asked her what her favorite stories involving them were so that I could read them. I did not offer or agree to make it an ongoing/current ship. Leah\u2019s replies to me OOC became incredibly short at this point, to such a degree that I couldn\u2019t ignore it. Rather that discuss it further right then, I promised her that I would read the comics she liked and we could work out the history together. Leah had always been a very amicable person, she\u2019d been in the group even longer than I had, so the sudden shortness was\u2026strange and very noticeable. \n\nWithin a few days of my odd conversation with Leah, Delilah\u2019s character I was in the\u2026turbulent\u2026ship with was unfollowed for activity reasons. She messaged me to tell me that she hadn\u2019t meant to let the character be unfollowed and would be reapplying for her when she could. That seemed like the perfect opportunity to talk to her, so I told her that she could (obviously) reapply for her if she wanted, but that I wasn\u2019t really feeling the ship and didn\u2019t want to continue it. She seemed a little put off and said that it must have been something she did, or how she wrote the character, since she knew I liked the \\*idea\\* of the ship. I told her that it just wasn\u2019t lining up for me, and that I was considering seeing if I could pursue things with the ex character Leah had been writing with me. In hindsight, I should not have offered that detail, but at the time I didn\u2019t want to seem as if I was blaming Delilah, even though several things she had done and was still doing were making me uncomfortable. \n\nRemember me mentioning that Deliah and Leah had become friends OOC? That detail that I hadn\u2019t given any thought to? Yeah. After that conversation with Delilah, I never got another reply in character from Leah. Every thread we had was suddenly dead in the water. \n\nDelilah messaged me to ask if I intended to pursue the ship with my new character and Leah\u2019s character, as if following up on the topic that had already earned me the strangely stony conversation with Leah. I told her that I didn\u2019t have any current plans to do that, but that I was reading comics to make sure we could include the history between them. \n\nDelilah then made a comment about how she hoped I wasn\u2019t going to pursue the popular M/M ship my new character is often included in, and that neither she or Leah liked it. It\u2019s important at this point to note that I\u2019m a gay man, which isn\u2019t a fact I go around hiding and that Delilah was perfectly aware of, so the sudden weird homophobic bend the conversation took was a little MUCH for me. I got short with her, and told her that I\u2019d be writing the character in a way that made sense to me, and that if it included the M/M ship then that was my call to make. Delilah immediately tried to play the whole thing off like she hadn\u2019t meant anything serious and that I didn\u2019t need to be upset. Yeah, alright. After Delilah had pressured me for M/F ERP in the (recent) past and then brought up THIS, which now extended to Leah, I was pretty over everything. Rather than have some kind of confrontation, I just told her \u201cokay\u201d or something similar, and we didn\u2019t speak again until\u2026\n\nSeveral of Delilah\u2019s characters got unfollowed for activity reasons just a day or two after that conversation. She decided to leave the group altogether, and messaged me to tell me that she\u2019d had fun writing with me and wished me the best. I did the same, even though all I felt was fucking relief to have her gone. \n\nLeah, who again had been with the group longer than me and never seemed to have any issues UNTIL our odd conversation where she slipped into cold replies, left the next day with only a short message to the group on our OOC page. Delilah and Leah ended up starting their own (very short lived) group after leaving. \n\nFast forward about two years, to when u/harlequinns and I are running the group together. Leah briefly returned to the group, never spoke to me OOC or acknowledged that we\u2019d ever written together at all. She wrote a few odd scenes, and ultimately left the group again after only being there for (at most) 2-3 weeks. Strange! That was the last we ultimately heard from her. \n\nDelilah did cause a few other issues in the game at large and with other players, but overall this was (obviously) not as explosive as the other tales. It did screw with me for a good while, though, and I struggled to write ERP for a long time because of things she did. By the time I had started to get over Delilah\u2019s behavior toward/about me, Dina came into the picture. \n\nThe universe is a joke, isn\u2019t it? \ud83e\udd23",

If they made arrangements under construction to reply X number of times a day, yeah you can be salty if they don't but it's not a contract. Maybe they should communicate if shit happens, but not everyone thinks clearly enough when the shit IS happening! When someone I know dies or gets sick the last thing on my mind is my chatrooms. Honestly, how fucked is it to prioritize your attention with a story with a stranger over someone who's being driven to a hospital and needs that attention more? It could be hours or days before I get back to realize it's BEEN DAYS because panic and tunnel vision. Or getting sick and being in a haze with medicine.\n\nWhere's the fucking empathy, guys?\n\nAnd even if rate of message isn't established, seeing someone on discord or whatever does not mean they can, will or should respond to the chat because guess what! Discord has more uses than RP and people are allowed to be busy or have hobbies.\n\nPeople use discord to communicate while gaming and idk about you but I hate getting bombarded with chats while trying to enjoy a game because it breaks my immersion in the game, and if I'm gaming with friends like I do on some weekends, they'd be really upset if I was distracted with someone else during their time. One of my three friends has schedule conflicts with me so we only get 1 or 2 days a week to try and play, and the third got moved from Washington state to fucking GERMANY because their husband is military so of those 2 days, we have to catch them awake and able at ungodly hours to play together so of course when the stars align for us I'm going to focus on them and ignore texts or notifs from everything short of someone dying or calling me.\n\nIt'd be like texting your bff while at dinner with your SO or vice versa. It's rude and makes them feel unimportant.\n\nA lot of people on this sub have such a hardon for consistency as if RP is a job or something requiring 9-5 dedication, 5-7 days a week. This standard is why I won't go looking for RP now outside my friend group who answer whenever we have time and still enjoy ourselves; if I get made to choose between my other hobbies and a roleplay when those hobbies are the only way I cope with my living situation then sorry not sorry, I'm choosing them over the RP.\n\nMaybe people with high demand for RP replies need to find other hobbies as well.

            "selftext": "**I want to preface this by saying I'm pretty new to RP.** \n\nI RP in a game (Final Fantasy 14) and I think that's a bit different than RP with Discord. I joined a new group of players recently (a free company / guild) and they have these RP events they call \"pop ups\" that you can go and do open RP with people. You don't do it over a few days like some of the stuff I've seen people talk about on here - it's like you set aside 2-3 hours and just talk off the cuff with everyone, letting the conversation and situation just flow naturally somewhere. \n\nI went to one earlier this evening and I came across a situation that I can only describe as feeling \"strong armed.\"\n\nI came up and greeted the other players and, barely after I had walked up and hadn't even introduced myself to a couple of the people (there were five of us when I walked up; they were all a part of this new FC that I joined except one), one of them sorta... forced the RP to cater to something she wanted to do. She pulled out a playing card and literally forced one of the other characters to play a card game with her.\n\nNormally I just step back and go with the flow (that's how my character is too) but I felt like she strong armed the entire group into doing something she wanted (the two people she asked to play the game with declined and she asked one of them again till they said yes; this is a two person only card game as well) and locked myself and another player from pretty much any interaction. Because of how dialog is set up, it's not really easy to have multiple conversations at once (I would have split into another group or something to talk to the other person but I'm new to the group and felt that might be overstepping; I'm also nervous still since I don't know these people that well). I realized as I was tabbed out and reading reddit because I was bored that over an hour had passed and I had only said like maybe four things since arriving at the beginning of the pop up (almost two hours ago).\n\nI know some of this might be due to my inexperience but I saw the other person that was sorta locked out of the conversation as well (I was still keeping up with the conversation to try to get back in and I saw she hadn't talked at all either) and some poor new person to the group was trying to join in and couldn't because these two girls had taken over the entire thing. I ended up just using my pet that I have IC as an excuse to dip out and now I'm wondering if there was something I could have either done better in the situation or if it was really bad behavior on their part.\n\nIf anyone would have any advice on this, I would greatly appreciate it. I feel really bad and super bummed out because I've been looking for an RP group for like a year now. The first pop up I had with people from the group was awesome and I felt so excited for this one today and now I feel like crap.",

            "selftext": "I wanted to wait a bit before posting this, because honestly I was furious when I found out.   \n\n\nA few days ago, someone else posted this long ass post about how they had a friend who was a mod and they left and it was this whole big thing, blah blah blah, etc., and then how in retrospect they realized that friend-mod was actually just making everyone miserable and yay for them being gone.   \n\n\nI, along with maybe two to three other people, commented on it with the whole \"ermagerhd no way, this same exact thing just happened to meeee.\" One person even tagged their own post saying \"dude this is like verbatim what happened to me.\"   \n\n\nSo, yeah, something almost identical happened to me in my server. My situation's a *little* different since there's more people involved and my sentiments at the end aren't *exactly* the same, but it's very, very similar. And I guess one of the other people involved thought it was me, sent it to my old mod, who then sent it to my boyfriend like \"she just can't leave this shit alone?\"   \n\n\nI have 2 accounts on reddit. One it this one. The other is three servers I advertise for smooshed together, a la \"ServerServerServer\" style, one of the servers is my main, it's VERY obvious it's me.   \nSo I guess I'm here now with a clearer mind and no rage in hopes that whomever it is that's trolling this subreddit looking for evidence of how \"immature\" I am, will see this as me saying:  \n\n\n*I've left you guys alone. Please give me the same courtesy.*   \nYes, it was a very similar situation, but a walk through the comments shows it was similar to a lot of people. Hell, a walk through this entire sub will show a lot of similar situations that we all went through. It's not because I have 50 billion accounts that I'm cycling through to drag people with. It's that these are just **common things that happen in RP**.   \n\n\nNone of it is personal. If there's anything to take away from the *numerous* stories just like ours, it's that sometimes good people grow apart and it's not any more complicated than that. If I had a genuine problem with you, I know how to reach you and tell you. I don't though, so I won't. Please, please, please, let me have that same respect.   \n\n\nThanks,   \n\\- N",

            "selftext": "huge trigger warning for discussions of fictional sexual assault, as well as gender related issues.\n\nthis was a great many years ago. I met a partner somewhere, could have been instagram or some now-defunct app called geeking. I was a teenager, a girl, and I only played male characters. always felt super weird about playing women and just refused to do it for some reason.\n\nthe first red flag was that their character was some stereotypical sweet subby boy with no real personality. mine was a charismatic, sort of comically villainous demon.\n\nI find smut roleplay with no plot exceedingly boring, and even though I was only a teenager at the time, I was already not vibing with where things were going. in order for the characters to have any interaction at all, my demon brought this human home with him. I think I was going for a kidnapping kinda scenario.\n\nthey make it to the bedroom. it seems like we\u2019re heading for smut, somehow. their boy has not exhibited a single intention or desire towards anything at all, and my demon has literally no reason to be attracted to him. he\u2019s just a blank canvas that looks cute. at a loss for what to do, I have my demon initiate something sexual. maybe I can make it a whole \u2018corruption of innocence\u2019 thing, even tho that was not my initial intention. \n\nmaybe this will be a romance, who knows.\n\ntheir replies swing wildly between describing things in a sexual context and then having her character refuse consent, verbally. I am stumped. I ask her ooc if she wants this to be a sex scene. she says yes, and tells me to continue.\n\nI\u2019m weirded out, but I have my demon continue. again, her character says he doesn\u2019t want it, tries to get away, and starts crying. I was like \u201cokay, so, this is not fun or hot at all.\u201d she wanted my character to rape hers. idk where tf this was supposed to go, but I cannot see any sort of fun and interesting relationship developing from a rape scene. it\u2019s also not in my demon\u2019s nature.\n\ndespite being hugely uncomfortable, I let things continue. I have no spine and her writing isn\u2019t that bad, so I don\u2019t want to say no. at this point I\u2019m thinking \u201cI\u2019m just going to have to change my character\u2019s personality and grind through this, maybe it will go somewhere cool.\u201d \n\nit doesn\u2019t go somewhere cool. it\u2019s just a rape scene. my replies get shorter and more sporadic. I\u2019m not vibing. I feel gross. we get to the point of, presumably, some form of penetration. when, out of nowhere, she says to me ooc, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to change it and have my boy be a trans boy.\u201d\n\nfirst of all, you\u2019ve already described his dick in the roleplay, so that\u2019s just retconning canon midway through. second\u2026 I feel deeply, almost panic-inducingly stressed about that.\n\nI don\u2019t reply. I try to figure it out. it\u2019s not my character, I can\u2019t decide for her what she wants to do with him. but this idea makes me nauseous. I don\u2019t have anything against trans people, do I? I don\u2019t think I do! there\u2019s just *something* that upsets me about a non consensual sex scene involving a trans character. \n\nit\u2019s almost like it\u2019s personally relatable to me and my own weird feelings about my anatomy. it\u2019s almost like this taps into something inherent to me as a person.\n\nI have a bizarre, earth-shattering moment of realisation.\n\nfeeling like I\u2019m in a trance, I write, for the first time in my young life, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but as a transgender person the idea of that in the context of this scene makes me incredibly uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember what happened after that. I think she accepted it and we moved on, but I don\u2019t think the roleplay continued much further, thank god.\n\nit was a couple months still before I actually came out outside of online interactions, but that night typing to a stranger on my phone in my childhood bedroom of my dad\u2019s house was the first time I ever admitted that to anyone. \n\nthat was nearly a decade ago. \n\nI now refuse to write scenes that make me uncomfortable right out the gate, and I\u2019d never write with someone that tries to do a hugely triggering scene like that without discussing it first. whatever the case, it\u2019s a super weird way to realise you\u2019re actually a man.",

            "selftext": "Hiya folks!\nI\u2019ve posted here once before, and am in the mood for a little polite rant. \n\nYou ever read a super well written post that is detailed, has proper rules and disclaimers of how the person operates? Posts that clearly say \u201cPlease don\u2019t ghost\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t ghost\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d rather we both be comfortable enough to share/admit that we aren\u2019t interested\u201d.\n\nI love those post\u2026 until the role play begins, is well set up, the friendly-ish connection is made, and the person stops replying. It\u2019s happened again just recently. The person had gone silent, so as I do, I checked in a few days later, to no reply. Eventually I checked Reddit and found that they had posted a couple of times, so I check in again in the friendliest way possible. Finally they reply that they\u2019ve been busy, etc. Sure enough, the server was disbanded without a word, and the person had posted quite a few times on Reddit. I guess there are bigger fish to fry in life, but it\u2019s still frustrating to see such a nice, promising role play go to waste.\n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk. That\u2019s all folks.",

I dunno but onto explaining why they are problematic now!\n\nOk first off, this teenager is absolutely annoying at times, they spam the chats with useless images, and well moderators are expected to delete this spam so I always have to, it gets repetitive but that\u2019s not the worst part, this person also has the guts to be extremely rude to other members and disrespectful, they are especially to me cause I\u2019m always on their ass about things as a mod, but again this isn\u2019t the worst part still!\n\nThe worst part? They will publicly have mental breakdowns in chat, and talk about triggering topics like selfharm or even say things like \u201cI shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d despite mods like I warning them, they just never listen! Not to mention they blow up on me for getting their pronouns wrong despite me correcting myself! \n\nThe whole situation got so bad I contacted the owner, he warned them, and if they act out again will be kicked, but seriously I should\u2019ve kicked them out on my own, thoughts? \n\nAlso their ocs suck to add to it, shallow and all the same\u2026",

This guy responded to my ad, where I listed several settings and genres I like, but the ad was open ended so we could RP in any of those settings. I asked him what setting he wanted to do and he just *wouldn't* answer me, after so much back and forth.  Blue is me, yellow is him.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/F1j4Zz2.png\n\nSince he didn't want to give me a straight answer, I eventually suggested Rimworld as a setting since that was basically what he was describing anyway. He agreed, then he makes the server...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/djH7Q3n.png\n\nHe named the server \"Rimworld ERP.\" **At no point** did I ever say I was looking for ERP. My ad was for romance adventure.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't capture the full convo but a while after this he was talking about how he wants my character to be dressed like a geisha when the story starts (Rimworld is a space western setting... not many geishas walking around..) and he's telling me all these details about what he likes about geisha outfits. That was when I lost my cool and left.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/g4mZKVJ.png\n\nNow, the ERP thing and the obsessing over my character's clothing were red flags, obviously, but what I'm curious about is the thing going on in my first screenshot. He didn't want to state his preferred setting. He only wanted to write out some kind of... atmospheric set piece and go from there?  Am I the ass here for demanding a clear cut answer?  Or is this a thing that people do?",

            "selftext": "So an update if anyone cares: \nBut to those that didnt. I posted a while back about a partner who many of you deemed to be a social vampire. Well you guys could be further from the truth. Thank you for your advice... they're actually out of my life now. But there's how we got there. \n\nWe did settle agreement but it was on shakey grounds. I thought things were ok and even promised to RP.... only to just go through the same shtick. Then I told them I was going to be on vacation. \nLiterally my last words on the conversation. Where from earlier this month and i haven't heard from them for a week. I've admit I have been enjoying my vacation and I didnt realize I haven't heard a peep from them. \nSo I messaged them asking if they were ok. Big mistake. \nThen then went to say how my energy was different and how I apparently wasnt into them entire thing and that they didnt bother to message me. To which I said that wasnt true, I just had been bust before my vacation.... it just developed into a mess. With them just blaming me for my \"lack of enthusiasm\"  which wasnt true. I post videos, I post art I draw and got commissioned of my character( yes MY character because they couldnt be fucked to send me a Ref of theirs) and HCs... to which even them just devolve into them into a misogynistic mess of them calling my character a Ho. So in honest why bother. \nWhy bother indeed. \nWhy bother putting the blame on me when I try to reach out and ask if you're  ok. To say I never cared about our friendship and say I never cared. To which I say I dont fucking care if you're reading this. I'm happy that you're doing ok and that I hope they continue to be better, but I dont appreciate the abuse and to be gas lit into feeling like I should be a canary.\n\nBut now all the art I've gotten done of my character just feels me with a bitter taste in my mouth. The movie they recommended would just leave just as much of a sour taste. I cared about the characters but... not what the mess it devolved into. I'm sorry I didnt speak up sooner... but I guess it just wasnt meant to be.",

            "selftext": "Not entirely sure if this is really an issue with me? I feel like as I've gone past ten years of RPing (now at 12 years) I've become more picky the characters presented to me. Because of this, I have had a difficult time finding RP partners in the last two years. I recently talked with a friend of mine about it who also RPs and explained it to her that I feel like characters that are presented to me by potential RP partners are either:\n\nA.) Pretty much what I stated I wasn't looking for.\n\nB.) Are the general idea (ie faction, if in a fandom, or character type), but are at least to me presented in such a way that the characters personality doesn't fit/it comes off like little thought was put into the character.\n\nC.) A very uninspired character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking to see other's opinion on this in regards to whether this is an issue with me. I'm sure why I became so picky. I didn't used to be. Maybe I got older? I hit my mid 20s now, so looking back to when I was 18-21, I cared less about the specifics of the character.\n\nAll in all, I feel like character development and personality are really make or break in a roleplay. The characters need to pair well personality wise and with the themes of the story. I feel really passionate about that and I don't mean to sound like a snob about it, but I really like that shit. But, feel free to double barrel blast me in the comments if I am being a dickhead. Thanks.",

Miami and I started off really great but over the past couple of years, the quality of the rp has dipped to the point of being almost non-existent.\n\nAt the beginning she was really great at choosing what she wanted, had high engagement, always had about a paragraph to write, would always switch off between starting the actual rp with me, and was also very friendly outside of the rps we would have.\n\nBut now, she\u2019ll take days to decide what she wants, I always have to start the rp, she barely writes a sentence, every time I talk to her out of rp she\u2019s always so moody towards me, and I have to be the one to create a plot and make the rp interesting because she doesn't put the time and effort into it like she use to. \n\nIn the beginning with the issues, I thought maybe she was going through a rough time and she reassured me she wanted to continue, she just had her own business to deal with. I said fine and I\u2019ve been trying to be supportive, giving her space, etc. But it\u2019s been about 3-4  years and she\u2019s just been treating me worse over the course of time. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I'm just so frustrated with it all now but when I bring up my concerns with her now, she tends to brush it off or tells me I'm overreacting. Miami makes me feel like I'm not good enough or I'm not worth the time or effort.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the asshole for being concerned and trying to let her do her own thing/ figure her business out but I know what we have now isn\u2019t what it use to be. I know it\u2019s not even healthy, especially with the way she\u2019s been treating me, especially in the past year.\n\nI'm honestly at the point of telling her that I'm done and I want out but I don't wanna leave on a sour note. I want to end things amicably but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a choice anymore! I don\u2019t know if I want advice or just to vent but I just feel stuck with this rper and I\u2019m miserable!",

            "selftext": "I'd inherited a group RP server from the previous owner. Things weren't meshing, everyone was getting along, except that our interests seemed to spontaneously clash with the server owners. Mind you, this was unexpected to us. The server had been advertised as ERP, the character creation process involved planning out a lot of ERP elements ahead of time, so that was what was on our mind at the time as we joked and made tentative plans for the future, plot willing.\n\nThe server owner had the grace to, instead of deleting the server, simply leaving. They transferred ownership, and after explaining that our interests simply didn't seem to mesh, had left. This server is still up, but very different from how it once was.\n\nAt the time, three of us were still there, and we were still making plans to RP, but having to start over since the GM had left with the former owner. One of us, who ended up being Co-GM to me in the new RP we formed, eventually just... vanished. At first, they explained that they were super busy IRL, and we accepted that explanation. We promised to wait, and sat twiddling our thumbs, busying ourselves with other things.\n\nAnd then one day... they just vanished entirely. If you know Discord, it tells you who wrote the post, even if they're not there on the server anymore. But if it says \"Deleted User#0000\", that means the account has been deleted. It even said that was their ID in the DMs I had with them. And that's what all their posts said, too. They'd deleted their account without warning.\n\nNow there were just two of us, and we were wracking our brains to figure out what happened. This person had been invited by the previous server owner, so it wasn't like I could DM them on Reddit or any other method of contact to find out what happened.\n\nSo far the best we've been able to figure out is either some kind of crisis causing the loss of their account, or that they were really a 12 year old who's mom caught what they were doing. Either way, they deleted their account without warning, and leaving us with our metaphorical pants around our ankles. We're still trying to contact them, but we've largely given up.",

            "selftext": "TW: Description of drug use and mentions of non-con in roleplay\n\nThis guy I was roleplaying with wasn't an awful writer. But, there were two things that made things very much an issue for me, 1) He didn't seem to properly research the subject manner at hand before getting ready to write about things (drug use) and 2) He didn't consult me before making a very plot changing decision\n\nBasically, the plot was supposed to be around 2 childhood friends with a very wholesome relationship. Talking like ages 8-11ish. Then, these two friends are separated and both take very dark paths in life. One becomes a prostitute (my character), the other a drug dealer (his). The meet again as adults, and despite their own lapses in judgement and poor decisions through their lives, they are surprised to see what kind of path the other has taken to get where they are today. Bonding and reconnecting to ensue... \n\nSo, things are going okay. Our characters are reconnecting and catching up. Reminiscing over old times and catching up. They start smoking together (pot), and are just chilling out. Until, for some reason, the act of smoking pot makes this guy/the drug dealer loose all moral compass apparently. He makes a mild sexual advance on m/c, of which she kind of goes with, but then is like \"nah I kind of just want to chill\"... And so his character LOSES it. He starts assaulting her. He stops midway through the assault and tells her/ m/c to shoot up (heroin), which was her drug of choice. She uses, and then he tells her to cook some up for him, and I quote \"to use as a pick me up\"... Now, um, heroin is *not* a pick me up lol. It's a downer. But, she readies him heroin, just trying to de-escalate the situation. But then he says, \"Never mind, YOU use it.\" ... She just used. Double dosing on something like heroin would have probably KILLED HER. But, I'm like, okay whatever I'mma suspend my disbelief and just roll with it. Afterwords, he continues to assault her in a full non-con scene that got pretty bad.\n\nAFTERWORDS, his character apologizes and blames smoking pot for bringing out this rather monstrous behavior. And then it's expected for the plot to just... Carry on as it was as the story of two childhood friends reconnecting. Uhhhh, yeah dude, Idk about all that, my chick wants NOTHING to do with yours now lol \n\nSo. Just as a mild defense: I do allow for non-con in roleplays, and I delve into a lot of fucked up territory, and I kind of make this pretty clear before I roleplay with people. BUT, you can't just have characters commit rape out of left field and expect the plot to just carry on the same way. \n\nAlso. The guy clearly didn't do much research. I'm not expecting people to be experts on hard drugs or anything in order to roleplay about it, but at least KNOW what the drug does if you're going to have a character use it...   \nAnd idk about you, but I've never seen someone fly into an uncontrollable rage and commit atrocities bc they smoked a little pot. But hey, maybe everyone experiences things differently. But, uh, yeah maybe discuss that first before popping it into the roleplay.",

This was an RP that had just started, we were maybe a dozen posts in, and I had told them one time before that I really need at least once a day to keep things primed.\n\nI don't expect my partners to be glued to their keyboards nor do I require constant attention, but someone who is only available to write 2-3 times a week vs daily has a fundamental incompatibility with me. Sure, we all have hiatuses/take vacation/need a few days off sometimes but that's my general expectation for a partner: that you can post at least once a day.  \n\n\nIf you know you can't commit to the schedule your partner prefers please don't reply to their ad. It's frustrating for both people involved.  \n\n\nJust a vent.",

            "selftext": "Also titled why I hate shipping teehee. \n\nSo if you have seen my first post I bet you already can sorta guess what is about to be dumped upon you but if you have not, you don\u2019t need to read my other post for context I promise. If anything it might add on to the psychic damage that I known I\u2019ve been going through with this server. \n\nSo, for respect and privacy sake we are gonna name today\u2019s problem person Erin. Mmkay. Me and Erin use to be friends or so I thought ( that seems to be a theme and next person to be my friend and betray me is getting personally kicked in the face ). But in any case. They very much like shipping. Which is fine. So, they make two characters one of which who they try pairing off with my character ( they said they thought it would be cute cause they look similar or something ) another of which that they slide with my close friend\u2019s Oc. Cool. \n\nSo randomly out of no where. Character that was meant to be with mine? Deleted. Character with close friend? Deleted. We get a rushed \u2018 pwease don\u2019t be mad \u2018 apology and all is dropped. Okay. \n\nThey make three new characters this time. And I\u2019m just gonna\u2026tell you how each one has done on the server and you\u2019ll pretty blatantly see the issue. \n\nCharacter 1: Tries to get with my character immediately, I say no cause buddy you need to romance them, I\u2019m dropped, character now goes for this girl, character 1 and girl are damn near in a relationship or working towards one, then suddenly. She is also dropped because Erin decided that the character would be \u201c cuter \u201c with some other girl. Relationship is extra rushed and Erin bugs people to make aesthetic for the ship. Okay. \n\n\nCharacter 2: Is just. God awful. Very hyper aggressive very \u2018 lolololol I\u2019m brat bottom tame me daddy!!!!!!!!!! \u2018 type beat. Tries to get with two guys but those guys are in a relationship and monogamous. Erin has a mental breakdown over people not finding this OC to be cute when they are his \u201c cutest baby yet \u201c. Character hops from person to person until they land on sweet character who will baby them. Cool I guess. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t seeing the pattern I\u2019m sure this third character will have your third eye gaping. \n\nCharacter 3: Use to be reserved for a character who I\u2019ll call, Nox. Nox wanted one my OCs, again they have to be romanced but this time Erin seems fine with that if not excited about it. They develop. It\u2019s kinda super cute. Erin in my DMs after I have to take a minor hiatus due to mental health \u2018 hey sorry but I\u2019m dropping Nox hope you understand. \u2018 me \u2018 yeah it\u2019s you Character so lol. \u2018 proceeds to then go to a staff member and LIE to them saying that I said their OC was rushed and bad and that it was better off if they were gotten rid of, then proceeds to ask said staff member for a ship with their new OC. Insert white guy blinking meme. I get so disgusted that I get rid of the OC that was shipped with Nox.\n\nNew Character ( I\u2019ll call them Elliot ) that replaced 3: Meant to be with staff\u2019s Character but when Staff member tells them it has to be a slow burn they bail on the ship and go to this other person\u2019s character who I\u2019ll call Mark. How do I know? Because my OC was trying for Mark and I just got a DM saying that Mark is now with Elliot. \n\nSomeone give me my own tv show I swear I can\u2019t make this shit up. I swear I can\u2019t stand people that have such bad vibes like this. The \u2018 I leave skid marks in plad boxers \u2018 vibes. I could scream. Also Erin? No longer talks to me. Figures.\n\nTLDR: I get cucked as an ex friend plays relationship tango with the entire server. Part of it is my fault. I should have told them no after the first time of being played but like any naive dumbass I prayed they wouldn\u2019t play me not once but thrice. But they did. They did me just like an electric guitar in a Smash Mouth song. \n\nAgain sorry for the dry unfunny humor it is the one thing keeping me from not only get lost in the sauce but disappearing in it to drown.",

            "selftext": "Also titled why I hate shipping teehee. \n\nSo if you have seen my first post I bet you already can sorta guess what is about to be dumped upon you but if you have not, you don\u2019t need to read my other post for context I promise. If anything it might add on to the psychic damage that I known I\u2019ve been going through with this server. \n\nSo, for respect and privacy sake we are gonna name today\u2019s problem person Erin. Mmkay. Me and Erin use to be friends or so I thought ( that seems to be a theme and next person to be my friend and betray me is getting personally kicked in the face ). But in any case. They very much like shipping. Which is fine. So, they make two characters one of which who they try pairing off with my character ( they said they thought it would be cute cause they look similar or something ) another of which that they slide with my close friend\u2019s Oc. Cool. \n\nSo randomly out of no where. Character that was meant to be with mine? Deleted. Character with close friend? Deleted. We get a rushed \u2018 pwease don\u2019t be mad \u2018 apology and all is dropped. Okay. \n\nThey make three new characters this time. And I\u2019m just gonna\u2026tell you how each one has done on the server and you\u2019ll pretty blatantly see the issue. \n\nCharacter 1: Tries to get with my character immediately, I say no cause buddy you need to romance them, I\u2019m dropped, character now goes for this girl, character 1 and girl are damn near in a relationship or working towards one, then suddenly. She is also dropped because Erin decided that the character would be \u201c cuter \u201c with some other girl. Relationship is extra rushed and Erin bugs people to make aesthetic for the ship. Okay. \n\n\nCharacter 2: Is just. God awful. Very hyper aggressive very \u2018 lolololol I\u2019m brat bottom tame me daddy!!!!!!!!!! \u2018 type beat. Tries to get with two guys but those guys are in a relationship and monogamous. Erin has a mental breakdown over people not finding this OC to be cute when they are his \u201c cutest baby yet \u201c. Character hops from person to person until they land on sweet character who will baby them. Cool I guess. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t seeing the pattern I\u2019m sure this third character will have your third eye gaping. \n\nCharacter 3: Use to be reserved for a character who I\u2019ll call, Nox. Nox wanted one my OCs, again they have to be romanced but this time Erin seems fine with that if not excited about it. They develop. It\u2019s kinda super cute. Erin in my DMs after I have to take a minor hiatus due to mental health \u2018 hey sorry but I\u2019m dropping Nox hope you understand. \u2018 me \u2018 yeah it\u2019s you Character so lol. \u2018 proceeds to then go to a staff member and LIE to them saying that I said their OC was rushed and bad and that it was better off if they were gotten rid of, then proceeds to ask said staff member for a ship with their new OC. Insert white guy blinking meme. I get so disgusted that I get rid of the OC that was shipped with Nox.\n\nNew Character ( I\u2019ll call them Elliot ) that replaced 3: Meant to be with staff\u2019s Character but when Staff member tells them it has to be a slow burn they bail on the ship and go to this other person\u2019s character who I\u2019ll call Mark. How do I know? Because my OC was trying for Mark and I just got a DM saying that Mark is now with Elliot. \n\nSomeone give me my own tv show I swear I can\u2019t make this shit up. I swear I can\u2019t stand people that have such bad vibes like this. The \u2018 I leave skid marks in plad boxers \u2018 vibes. I could scream. Also Erin? No longer talks to me. Figures.\n\nTLDR: I get cucked as an ex friend plays relationship tango with the entire server. Part of it is my fault. I should have told them no after the first time of being played but like any naive dumbass I prayed they wouldn\u2019t play me not once but thrice. But they did. They did me just like an electric guitar in a Smash Mouth song. \n\nAgain sorry for the dry unfunny humor it is the one thing keeping me from not only get lost in the sauce but disappearing in it to drown.",

            "selftext": "So, I used to staff in a Camp Half-Blood RP server, set on a fictional sister camp to CHB that we created for the RP. We spent quite a bit of time coming up with a ton of different gods and goddesses and monsters for players to choose from. By the end of the all the brainstorming and writing and rewriting, we had 38 gods and goddesses, all of them Greek (which is important for later in the story), as well as 8 monster species, and we opened up the possibility for hybrids as well. Needless to say, there were plenty of options.\n\nThen along comes this user (we'll call them Gary, for ease of typing), who decides to make a suggestion: add Roman gods to the server. The mod team, myself included, deliberated over this before deciding that we had enough choices as is. It's also important to note that the server had just started at this point, so most of the gods had no OCs at this point. A daughter of Psyche here, a son of Ares there, etc. So we politely decline the suggestion, and we all pretty much thought that'd be the end of it. Oh man, were we ever wrong.\n\nI unfortunately don't remember exactly what was said, since Gary was banned following this incident, but Gary goes to general chat and throws a shit fit. He starts complaining about how this server will die and how we're restricting player choice. One of the quotes of his I did save was \"successful, well ran, and long-lasting servers promote freedom of choice for their members.\" Right... freedom of choice... like 38 gods and goddesses and 8 monster species, perhaps? He accused the staff of being lazy (insert blinking gif here), and we eventually had to ban him because he would not shut up about restricting player choice while simultaneously insulting the staff members.\n\nYou'd think that'd be the end of the story, but there's one last little interaction to cap off everything. Gary goes and runs to one of the staff member's DMs, and continues to talk about this issue. When the staff member tries to call him out, Gary responds with \"The whole Roman thing wasn't a big deal, I used it to test the durability of this server.\" Yeah... sure. That's a logical way to look at it (it's not actually). Why do you need to test the server by throwing a temper tantrum in general because you can't have the gods you wanted? Why do you need to test the server at all? So... yeah, in the moment I remember that being a super frustrating argument to have. Now, I laugh literally every time I think of this story.",

            "selftext": "I'm fond of literate, multiple paragraph-spanning threads with multitudes of characters that go in many different directions plot-wise and take months and months of slowburn to even lead up to the chastest of touches. However, I'm 17- and my fellow RPers who are fond of this sort of thing are few and far between as it is, and mostly in their late 20s-30s, or even 40s. It's really quite frustrating because in technical terms I'm quite capable of keeping up with them (and this is not something I mean to say in a 'bragging' sense), but my age always gets a big 'no' from the exact types of writers I seek out in rp groups or otherwise normal rp ads I see on tumblr or livejournal. \n\nAnyone my own age just doesn't end up working out, and I have yet to find someone who can meet my needs. I don't necessarily need romantic or explicit plots but it would be really nice to find someone both age-appropriate and fun to roleplay with, who would be dedicated enough to the story and not just the instant romantic connection between our characters.",

            "selftext": "Okay, this is the funniest thing that has ever happened to me. A few months ago, I got in contact with a Reddit user by the name of \"am*****\", he's since deleted his account though, we tried RPing, but we didn't really go anywhere because I had a few partners with whom I was RPing at the time. My financial situation wasn't the best and I asked him if he'd help me a bit because honestly, he seemed like a good guy, he flipped and that was that. (Maybe that wasn't the best idea, but I was desperate). He's since commented under each and every one of my posts telling people I sell myself for a chance to RP, which isn't true. Today, I've had enough and I told him to stand down in the kindest way possible, some \"new guy\", added me on Discord after seeing all the commotion - his name is \"Lo***\", he started comforting me, saying that the guy in the comments is an asshole and this and that, he actually gets me to open up a bit, but I hesitate to tell him anything because I feel something's up, a few hours pass and he starts guilt-tripping me (he asked if I wanted to RP and that I had to do it because he somehow \"helped me\" fight off the \"ami****\" account), I get pissed off and we get into a fight which ended up with me blocking him. I hope you're still bearing with me because this will get a bit more fun. Not long after the Discord add, I get a message from a Reddit account called \"jarja******\" on my alt. We talk and, again, something's up, but I don't really focus on the feeling as we continued talking. A few minutes ago, we started roleplaying something along the lines of roommates, doesn't matter, I don't remember half of it, as we were about to move onto discord, the guys says this, and I quote. \" you've already blocked me and called me a disgusting human, you bitch! Yeah It was me. You didn't wanna do threesome, right? Yeah, Enjoy your time with Elysian lol! And you know what, this is the same guy that commented you were a seller below your posts. I deleted that account to make this. Your rp isn't even that good, lol! Fuck you! \" At this point, I just start laughing so hard. But this isn't the end. He now added me on his new account \"su*****\" and started apologizing, calling himself names. Now, I'm not a psych, but this doesn't seem normal to me. TLDR - Guy tries talking to me on 4 separate accounts, playing 4 separate people in a weird but funny revenge plot against me. If you need proof, because this is quite a weird story, I can supply everything",
