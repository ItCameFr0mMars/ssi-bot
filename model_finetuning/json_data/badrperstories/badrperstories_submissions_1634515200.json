I haven\u2019t gotten a single reply from her since June. And that reply had me carrying all the weight and basically she just responded to it without much substance. Before this, we were replying somewhat frequently and did at least talk about our RPs. Now, it\u2019s rare. We talk about other things, which is nice I guess. I didn\u2019t really sign on to be friends with her, as in friends no matter if the RP fails or not. I signed on to RP, and I\u2019ve told her this a few times last year. \n\nHowever, now this RP reply gap, and reluctance to talk about the RPs has had me really questioning if I even want to continue my RPs with her. I\u2019m fine with waiting, but she keeps leaving me hanging after promising she\u2019ll get something out. And she always says she feels so \u201cguilty\u201d about it, that she missed her own deadline, etc. \n\nNow, she\u2019s planning to get pregnant and that\u2019s all she\u2019s been talking about since earlier this week. I\u2019m happy for her, but I don\u2019t know if I can continue to ignore all these red flags that our RPs will never continue. Even sadder, I\u2019ve spent over $100 on art of our characters and of scenes/interactions that happened within the RP. I\u2019ve even designed characters for her to use for the RP (characters that were given to her under the promise of they\u2019ll be used exclusively for the RP since I designed them free of charge). \n\nAfter investing all this time and money, I\u2019m really not sure what to do now. Should I just break off the RPs so I can use those characters in other RPs or?\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking this.\u2026",

            "selftext": "This happened a few years ago, but a friend was ranting me about a similar situation so I decided to vent/laugh about a Bad RPer situation that boggled my mind.\n\nWhen you create a character, you give them all sorts of motivations, personal ideals or goals, and a general personality that determines how they interact with the people around them.\n\nIn this game, a D&amp;D-esque situation where a group of us got together to participate in a grand story, our group had just gotten back from the generic \"Team's First Mission\" type of deal. Having solidified our characters in our minds through that event, and no one having any desire to change things up, we were introduced to the \"main story\" so to speak and given the breadcrumbs to follow to get started on it.\n\nOne character, however, said \"No.\" Naturally we were a bit confused, with our characters (and us) asking why, but she didn't give any response. Figuring she was having second thoughts on her character, I had my own character simply shrug and wish her well.\n\nIt was at that point that the player OOCly said \"Wait no you're supposed to ask her backstory questions.\"\n\nI was floored, not only because apparently I was supposed to somehow read her mind and know specifically what questions to ask, but that we were supposed to goad the motivation out of her. There are plenty of reasons for a character to question taking on certain tasks or quests, but I'd always been under the assumption that the player should create the character's motivation to joining the campaign. She eventually threw a bit of a fit and left the group, and I'd always looked back on that situation and wonder what prompts a person to go \"I've read your story premise, I think it looks great, now I'm going to create a character and you're going to change the narrative to fit my own needs.\"",

            "selftext": " So, let me preface this by saying I typically come up with dark romance storylines. They're fun and there's a lot more room to expand a character. \n\nOn to the problem. I was looking for someone to RP with a few days ago and I was interested in different plot ideas so I left my messages open so people can pm me. Some guy messages me a list of dark romance ideas... and when I say list I mean it was a pretty lengthy one. Out of all of them, I asked him about the teacher/student idea. I asked him if it was in a high school setting or a college setting... he said neither. He then goes on to tell me he wants my character to be a middle schooler. Now, considering a middle schooler is still a child, I was not comfortable roleplaying as a child, especially since he wanted there to be some smut in the storyline. I was honest and told him it's not something I'm comfortable with and he suddenly gets his feelings hurt, calls me judgemental, and says that I'm a kink shamer. \n\nNow on to my question. Was I wrong for being uncomfortable with the storyline? I feel like when it comes to taboo plot ideas, there has to be some type of line that just shouldn't be crossed. I understand it's just roleplay, but I've noticed an influx of people using roleplaying as a way to play out a storyline that would otherwise be illegal if it happened in real life. Please for the love of god someone tell me if I was in the wrong for being uncomfortable.",

I just see roleplay as a hobby for me and others. \n\nAm I just a sheltered roleplayer? Do people get upset now if you don\u2019t answer for a day or weeks?

How nice that she even offered to do it. Unless, you know, it was just a way to make me wait endlessly as she didn't write any more for an entire day.\n\nAnd then magically a roleplaying subreddit based on my kind of idea shows up with narrative content on the same day she's been ghosting me. She claimed later it's a coincidence that the subreddit's name is suspiciously similar to the name of the discord server I made (which she didn't even join) and that she was \"already working on the subreddit with a friend\".\n\nWhatever she didn't write for our RP definitely ended up on the subreddit, always on the same day.

I would love to hear what more experienced writers recommend if I can help this person improve or if I should just leave this at 'We don't mesh, sorry.' I think this person is perfectly nice and an enthusiastic rper, but there are a whole slew of things that kinda aren't meshing. I'm trying to power through and see if we can reach a point in the plot where I can take a little charge and dictate the situation but thus far I've not had the chance to get invested.\n\nBut to list off just a few things that I'm struggling with and am looking for solutions so we can continue and make it enjoyable for both parties.\n\n*English is presumably not their first language, though they've not said it directly. For the most part I can understand what they write but the grammar mistakes does normally mean I have to give the reply a few reads to put together. (I have no issue with ESL roleplayers! I am just struggling to read their writing)\n\n*Thus far, they've written a LOT of my character for me. What oc is feeling, going through an entire action sequence with my oc huddled to the side, controlling my oc to go where their oc wanted. I don't feel this is entirely intentional, but it's still jarring.\n\n*Finally, they tend to poke me for replies if I'm online on discord but not responding. I don't mind if my partner shoots me a message if I don't reply for more than a full 24 hours, but it's literally every time I get on discord I get poked for a reply.\n\nI'm probably gonna delete this bc I feel horrible for complaining about an rp partner, but I seriously don't know if I can fix all these issues or if I should just tell them it's not working out and move on.

            "selftext": "Bouncing off the 'dark themes' post. \n\nI have never posted an RP ad with 'dark themes' as a specific wording but I do enjoy RPs that have some content that is questionable like wartime violence, suicide, alcoholism, drug use, etc. With that, I have a few triggers and things I do NOT want present in a roleplay. No matter how specific I get with these it seems like it's never 'specific enough' for a certain kind of person.\n\nIf you aren't sure what your partner's comfort levels and boundaries are, ASK. It's really quick to say 'hey would you be comfortable if &lt;specific kind of bad thing&gt; happened?' and you should be doing this anyway because it takes two seconds. There's no need to blindside your partner with potentially triggering content. It's very easy to not accidentally cross boundaries. All you need to do is ASK if something is okay before you write it and present it to your partner. \n\nI cannot count the number of times I or my partner have gone 'hey, is it okay if this potentially triggering thing happens as part of the plot?' and if that ruins the RP for you, maybe you need a new hobby.\n\nAlong with this, if you can't renegotiate over the course of an RP, you shouldn't be RPing. Sometimes things will seem okay until they're on paper, and then it turns out you or your partner was actually not okay with it, it's too difficult to write about, etc. In these cases it should be 100% okay to renegotiate your boundaries and terms of engagement. If you are unwilling to do this or get snippety with someone who goes 'oh, actually now that this is out there it's bothering me', then YOU are the bad RPer.\n\nAgain, this shit is easy. You shouldn't be assuming everyone is OK with everything because they put the word 'dark' in their RP ad. *Just ask*. It's not difficult to do.\n\nEndrant.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so, my characters consisted of a pair of teens. A thief (CharA) and her friend (CharacB), who, having a much stronger moral compass didn't commit any crimes and was strongly against her doing so but was forced to let her crimes go unreported because the money she provided him was the only way his sick family could survive (he was too dimwitted to make ends meet by himself, and CharA felt responsible for his well-being). Anyway, here's a list of incidents that happened in the server.\n\n1. CharA showed off a necklace she'd stolen to CharB. Shortly thereafter, other RPers decided to make an NPC to be the one she'd stolen it from, and make a miniquest revolving around that and capturing my characters, without first consulting me (including retroactively writing actions for my characters). This meant I was very limited in what I could do and who I could interact with. Furthermore, I've since seen a post involving another character pulling out a stolen item, and nobody seemed to make a quest themed around that.\n2. My duo hitched a ride on a boat with some other characters. At one point, someone on board (CharC) said, \"By the way, I'm not legally allowed to enter dungeons, so can everyone say I stayed on the boat?\" So CharA said, \"If you promise to say you didn't see anyone with a necklace if someone asks, you've got a deal.\" I thought that would be the end of that and nothing more would come of it, but instead the other characters kept pressing her about it. There was a brief window of time where no one dwelled on it, but then CharC brought it up again when nobody seemed to find it important, and the others decided to turn the boat around to hand my two over to the authorities. I didn't like this, but no one was interested in being courteous to me, instead spamming the OOC chat with Among Us memes and saying stuff like \"you were too sussy\". One person offered to retcon it and have the group keep going, and I was happy with that, saying I'd retcon the behavior (because I was trying to be courteous, I did say \"if everyone is okay with it). They did... but missed the point entirely by having the group turn back not because of an actual retcon, but because of a storm forcing them to keep going the original route, and they still planned to turn my characters over to the authorities. I had to come up with a way for CharA to trick the others so she and her friend could get away. At several points later on, CharC mocked my characters for being bad at hiding their crimes even though he himself had straight up admitted he was doing something illegal in front of my duo, who he hadn't met up until that point.\n3. I later agreed to allow a group to arrest my characters (this included the people from the previous incident, despite their refusal to accommodate me before). One of the characters (CharD) is explicitly described as \"kind\" in their bio (and by other characters). However, he physically abused CharB while taking him to jail, even though he wasn't resisting arrest and had done absolutely nothing to CharD. Compounding it, he did that not because CharB supposedly stole, but because something beyond CharA and CharB's control made the search for them inconvenient. Other characters to this day regard him as kindhearted. See also: [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero) Basically, it's fine if CharD takes his anger out on people who haven't done anything to him personally, but it's horrible if CharA does it. Also, someone in the server thinks these actions were good, despite having previously said police brutality is bad. Doublethink, anyone? And a final thing: CharD is friends with someone who used to be a thief, and doesn't feel the need to physically abuse HIM. Assuming he knew this information, this is evidence of a self-centered sense of morality.",

We\u2019d always let each other know when we could and couldn\u2019t respond or just send things that reminded us of the characters. But for the last 9 days, my partner hasn\u2019t responded ic or ooc. I know that doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal and it\u2019s most likely nothing, but I\u2019m starting to worry. In my rules it says that I don\u2019t like going several days without an explanation, if I get one I\u2019ll absolutely wait and give people the time they need. We\u2019ve never gone this long without some kind of communication.\n\nFor the last 9 days, I\u2019ve seen my partner online. Okay, by itself that doesn\u2019t mean much but I\u2019ve seen them online looking at other posts and chatting (the app I use allows for others to see). I want to start our rp again, but I don\u2019t even know what to say. \n\nDuring our last conversation, I was showing them charms I just got and joking around. I deleted one message that just said \u201chey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d and more recently changed the background because I was tired of the color. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should poke them ooc or just send a repost or something else all together. I\u2019m friendly with this person ooc, so I don\u2019t want to be rude but I\u2019m afraid that this is a case of ghosting.",

I've been on reddit for about five months on my last account, until I decided to roleplay with a girl who goes by her internet name \"Kat****\". It was fun at first. We met on omegle and she liked my prompt I told her. That's how we decided to go longterm on reddit and later discord. It was fun at first she had a server for her friends who also did rp with her.\n\n  English is not my first language so there were some language issues while I rp'd. People have been mocking me about it here and there, but I didn't took it much seriously back then. \n\n  Some days later, I got comfortable with those people in the server and started opening up a bit. But as soon as I mentioned this kink of mine, (I'd rather not say it here cause I'm still not over it) they all started kinkshaming me. And I mean every active member of that server. Even \"Kat****\" who was really sweet in the beginning. I've asked multiple people why it was such a bug deal, no one told me why, but the mocking went on. \nThat's when I deleted my discord account, so I had a bit of peace. But the very next day, they started spamming my reddit too. I don't know why they do this! So the first thing I did after making this account was block her and some of her friends who spammed my reddit last time. Hoping to have a better time on reddit this time. I will never forget you \"Kat****\" .",

It's a can of worms that I'm not super eager to get into, but it's relevant in the sense that I've A: Never done an RP with significant amounts of slow-burn romance as opposed to straight up smut, B: Never done an RP where it's significantly character driven as opposed to having a set plot from the beginning, and C: Never done an RP where the format is 4-5 long posts a day as opposed to rapid-fire smaller posts over the course of a few hours.\n\nIt's entirely new territory for me, and while apparently I'm doing fine I want to be able to nix any bad habits or bad etiquette before they become a problem. Should I take notes on the RP or something? What can I do better in a slow-burn romance story? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!",

            "selftext": "I saw there was a bit of drama regarding the topic of dark themes due to a certain automod banning the word. So I'm here say that if you're not incredibly specific, saying you like dark themes can become a contradiction. You need to be incredibly specific because dark themes is not just violence, gore, and cursing. A lot of the times, it treads into the taboo territories like violent crime, war, suicide, drugs. Even just saying \"I'd prefer no mentions or acts of verbal or physical abuse.\" is still very broad because violence (the most general thing dark themes entails) implies physical abuse. Saying \"I'd prefer no mentions or acts sexual assault\" is being much more specific and is much less likely to be confused about what bounders as sexual assault. For anyone roleplaying, if you're going to advertise dark themes it's VERY important that you specify what makes you uncomfortable and I mean SPECIFY the tiniest of details. I'm not saying you can't have a lot triggers to advertise a dark-themed roleplay, I'm saying you MUST be incredibly specific because a lot of roleplayers who do roleplay dark themes and go looking for it have little to no triggers and no good roleplayer wants to accidentally cross somebody's boundaries.",

            "selftext": "Today was the day, a member who had been causing multiple problems for months in our server has finally received the hammer (ban) in short they were given a warning by the owner himself and defied the owner, so upon us mods bringing it up to him he finally removed the problem child permanently. Let\u2019s talk about this person now shall we?\n\nOkay so first off, I am a moderator of this small Homestuck roleplaying server, I take my job seriously and do what needs to be done, everyone in there can agree I am a great mod, in fact the owner is glad he appointed me as one, but the only times I\u2019d ever have to get on somebody was with problem child, you see, problem child wasn\u2019t always a problem until\u2026.\n\n1. They added an (albeit) terrible oc, let me explain this oc, this oc has a habit of simping for other characters and cheating, see where I\u2019m going? Well anyways this oc had a random out of the blue likeness for the owners oc \u201cthe governor\u201d (he\u2019s like the main baddie of the plot we got going) and this terrible oc tells the governor she always liked him etc etc and then proceeds TO ASK HIM TO HAVE SEX WITH HER. The governor says no but she keeps pushing till she gets what she wants, ooc the bad oc owner wants to ERP the situation and the owner DOES NOT but is forced to uncomfortably, so they do it, and ooc the bad oc owner brags about how their oc had sex with the governor who cares? Really? Anyways later on bad oc cheats on the governor and we all get riled up for it, then she cheats again\u2026 (we got on them ab it later) \n\n2. They kept pushing for ocs to be in romantics when they never met before, a smaller problem more annoying than anything.\n\n3. This person would keep being rude and inconsiderate ooc, rudeness says for itself but inconsiderate doesn\u2019t, they\u2019d act like they were the only one with problems and throw tantrums when we wouldn\u2019t pay attention or ignore them, they would butt into conversations and appear overall unlikeable and toxic\u2026\n\n4. They would \u201cbrag\u201d about their characters having sex ooc, and act like it was funny or quirky. \n\n5. A big one, they would fake having a mental illness and treat it as quirky or cute (they faked having DID which would piss those off who actually had it) \n\n6. They couldn\u2019t take any form of criticism about their characters (their ocs were bad that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say) \n\n7. They would have meltdowns and talk ab triggering topics in public chat (public server FYI)\n\nProbably more I will update as I remember\u2026",

And it's no fault of their own, I just...am not a fan of their writing style? I've noticed my style tends to bounce off whoever I'm writing with, like if I'm writing with someone whose extremely descriptive, likewise I'll have a pretty descriptive and quality reply. \n\nWe're about 3 replies in and I'm just not feeling it with their writing? I think I've spoiled myself from having so many amazing partners in the past. Another person I'm writing with is in a similar boat, but nowhere near as bad. I like their writing, it's okay and I can see myself writing for a little while with them\u2014I wish I didn't feel this way because finding writing partners is really difficult for me. I like to take my time and have someone to bounce off of with ideas? Whose really not all that picky on how long I take, but finding someone that fits into that box can be so hard. And it feels like the more I specify what I want in writing ads, the less people (if any) actually respond.\n\nAny advice on what to do here? I admittedly am what you'd call a ghoster in these scenarios. I'm really afraid of just telling them upfront, but ghosting just sours everything and they seem really excited :(. It makes me want to just push through it because I don't wanna leave them hanging on that last reply.",

And I would frequently ask \u201cdo you even want to rp?\u201d And she\u2019d respond with \u201cyes!\u201d And I don\u2019t get why you\u2019d lie. Right now is the worst time for it too. \n\nWe had been rping since I started I\u2019m January, she was my third Rp partner ever. She got me to change my writing style, I\u2019m Semi-lit-lit because of her! She was with me when I got with a girl that actually loves me, she was with me when I was told me grandparents were killed and she talked with me through that. We would talk about family, and we\u2019d vent together. And recently after she broke up with her boyfriend we kinda stopped. It slowed a bit, and then we stopped. I asked her if she was okay, and she responded \u201cyes\u201d but she told me that she wasn\u2019t in the mood to write. So we take a break, I told her an idea that she liked. And I got busy with work and school for this week. And today she has another account that I know is her because of the post, same as on the one I know her from\u2026 \n\nThis is the worst time too, I told my boss that his wife was cheating on her, so he sent me home, my parents are pissed about that, (I\u2019m scared I\u2019m fired) my sister is mad at me because I told our parents about her OF. She is 36 and an adult, but she doesn\u2019t need to do it in the house where her brother and daughter live. She has a boyfriend that has an apartment. Then my girlfriend and I got into a fight, and I\u2019m scared I lost her. I\u2019m gonna have to go live in the dorm at my college that I claimed a bed in before going back home and staying. Now I\u2019m in a park crying on a bench. \n\nThe rp thing is not even close to the worst thing here, but holy shit it hurt. And I don\u2019t know why it hurt me.",

            "selftext": "So I posted an ad hoping to find some new rp partners recently, and someone replied asking to do a Star Trek RP with them playing the captain and me playing the Chief Science Officer. So, from the beginning they give off weird rushy vibes like they're more focused on getting out as many replies as possible rather than like, making sure their replies are good. Asking me if I'm going to reply soon and adding that \"But totally no rush!\" Except the message inherently made it seem like they were impatient. \n\nSo I wrote my reply and in it my character mentions herself and her friend, the ship's Doctor, and she doesn't mention the full name of either because it felt unnatural for the character to do so in her own internal monologue. But ofc if the person was wondering what their last names were she could've just asked. \n\nSo she sends her reply and calls all the Senior Officers to the bridge, and she calls all of them by full name, except for mine, and then later mentioned in her reply that it was odd that my characters just didn't have last names.... so I messaged her OOC and told her if she wanted to know their last names, she could've just asked? She told me \"since I was on 'Do Not Disturb' she didn't want to disturb me... first of all, my status is always set to DND because I like that notification setting better. Second of all, she sent the reply anyway and started putting faceclaims in the OOC chat... so that's inconsistent logic. Like you do not have to put out a reply INMEDIATELY, you can wait 5 minutes for me to get back to you with the names of my characters. Also even with that reasoning the line about how her character thought it was weird that mine just Didn't have last names is still totally unnecessary",

            "selftext": "So this is something I\u2019ve come to realize while looking through the role play side of Reddit is that nearly EVERYONE either only plays as a female, or if they play a male they are only looking for females.\n\nSo obviously I understand we all have our preferences when it comes to our characters, and sometimes you simply don\u2019t feel comfortable playing as the opposite gender. I\u2019m not mad at anyone for this, and usually this doesn\u2019t really create that many problems.\nSee I\u2019m a female who mainly plays male characters, so it usually works out. I\u2019ve found some AMAZING people on here and have no complaints for them. However I\u2019ve been looking to add maybe one more partner that\u2019s willing to do MalexMale roleplay/ play male characters to shake things up a bit and am beginning to realize just how impossible a task it is. \n\nSo I guess my question is why are so many people so hard set on playing just as one gender? In my mind it\u2019s a character, so no matter the gender it\u2019s still basically a puppet your controlling. So as someone who (though I mainly do male) willing to play male or female it just confuses me the sheer amount of people I find who will only play only one or the other with no wiggle room what\u2019s so ever. \n\n\nThis to be clear this isn\u2019t me criticizing anyone, just genuine curiosity. \nThe point of role play is to have fun after all, so forcing someone to play as something they are not comfortable isn\u2019t fair.",
