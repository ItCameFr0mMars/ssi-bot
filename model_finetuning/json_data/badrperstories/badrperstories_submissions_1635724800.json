It ended up being Resident Evil related (favorite game) with Mr. X being the main focus. My partner of course saw the change and decided to write: \"pp is a pretty big turn off.\" \n\nI thought it was a joke at first, but that's when another message came in: \"im not gonna continue if it stays like that.\" \n\nAnd to make a long story short: I didn't change back, I ended up getting blocked and that's how our RP ended.",

            "selftext": "I had this roleplay partner that was actually a really good roleplayer. He was easy to talk to too and we seemed to like a lot of the same stuff. It was a good setup.\n\nAfter about a month and a half of roleplaying, he stopped answering. Now, of course, I messaged him on multiple occasions, really just to ask if he wanted to continue or if he was alright since I know people have life outside of roleplaying. We used Discord and his status had changed once or twice, so I knew he wasn't dead or had lost his information or something. After a few days of messaging, I had assumed he'd ghosted me and moved on. It did sadden me that he had done it, not just because he was a good roleplay partner, but that he seemed mature enough to express he did not continue instead of just ghosting. Oh well.\n\nThen almost two whole months goes by, and I get a message from him after totaling forgetting all about him. The message wasn't containing an explanation or apology but instead just continued the roleplay where it had left off like nothing happened. At that time I was taking a little break which my roleplay partners were aware of so I didn't bother responding at all. I also didn't because he did ghost me without any reasoning. After a day of not responding to him, he started messaging me asking if I \"still wanted to conitinue\" or if \"i was there\" and so on. Then after two days his messages started getting aggresive, saying things like \"if you don't want to roleplay then say something\", \"do you have a problem with me?\", \"hello?!!\", etc.\n\nFinally I started getting annoyed so I messaged him saying: \"You ghosted me without saying anything and I understand everyone has a life and reasons, but you just ignored me when you were clearly still online. I even got worried that something had happened to you at one point. You cannot sit here and get upset with me after you ghosted me for two months. Grow up.\"\n\nHe then immediately replied, spamming me like a child with messages like: \"It's not my fault I got bored of it!!\", \"you ghosted me too!!\" and \"I needed a break wtf!!!\". Then he got the lowest point and started with insults and foul language so I decided now was the time to block him.\n\nGrown adults acting like children after being treated the way they treated you. Sucks to lose his roleplaying since he was really great and I don't seem to come across many good roleplayers anymore. But then again, I have no regrets in blocking him either.\n\n[Also I do not know if I used the correct flair so please let me know if I didn't.",

            "selftext": "I used to roleplay a lot when I was a teenager -- generally with my friends. I was 16 when I roleplayed a romance plot with one of my friends. At the time, I thought she was around my age and didn't find out her legitimate age until three years later. This was on Roblox, so nothing explicitly sexual happened. I think our characters made-out at most and cuddled. We were friends, and I didn't really consider that she could have been much younger than me. I figured that it didn't matter anyway since we were both minors role-playing together. \n\nBut I later found out that she was 12 throughout all of this. She always just allowed me to assume what her age was and would never give me a direct answer when I asked. I probably should have dropped contact there, but we were friends and I figured that maybe she just didn't wanna give out personal information so I ignored it. I was genuinely surprised when she told me her actual age though. (She was 12 at the time of the roleplay, and I was 16.)\n\nBut now I feel horrible. I've apologized, told my therapist, and I've been worried that I'm gonna go to prison for this. I feel so guilty. I should have known, but I also feel duped in a way. I just didn't consider the legal ramifications back then -- maybe because I was just 16 but still. I don't know how I'm going to beat this; it's been dragging me down for two years now.",

            "selftext": "Based on a couple of posts I've seen about partners slowly vanishing, I've decided to make my own as the guilty party. I met my only current RP partner on Tumblr exactly three months ago, and we hit it off, becoming close friends and chatting ooc every day. Over time, though, I started to notice... from the beginning, I've been the only one who pitches plot ideas and leads the story.\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm not excited to receive roleplay replies from my partner any more, but I want to be.\n\nAt first, I would reply multiple times a day, but recently that's dwindled down to once a day or every few days. My partner always replies within a few hours without failure. He tells me that my posts are great enough to make him emotional and that he sometimes reads through our RP when he gets bored.\n\nWe've tried starting multiple new threads while continuing the original, but again, the plotting phase goes along with me throwing out ideas and him responding with, \"Yes! That's a good idea!\" He never really approaches me with one of his own, including when I ask, \"Is there anything you'd like to see in this scenario?\" The answer is, \"Nope, I like what we have so far!\"\n\nMy partner has one or two glaring typos or grammar mistakes in all of his posts, which is just a small nitpick, but it does break the immersion a bit. In the past, I've had partners whose posts I always looked forward to because of their impressive writing and how they consistently brought new actions or ideas to the table. Now, it feels like I know everything that is going to happen in the roleplay; I can't expect my partner to add in any interesting surprises.\n\nHe does give me enough content to work with and isn't lazy with his writing in the slightest - it reaches up to four paragraphs or more - but that's about all. His posts are 90% in reaction to what I've said in mine. We do ship-based fandom RP, and it's usually on my shoulders to lead the romance along (doing the scene changes, initiating the first kiss, and so on). I feel that if I never did any leading, \n\nGod, I feel terrible just for typing this. Maybe it's all my bad and my expectations are too high. The thing is: *I want to stay invested in our story!* It meant so much to me before, and I never want to lose his friendship either. He has a submissive personality and struggles with anxiety, so I don't know if I could even approach him about this. If I did, I would need to frame it in a way to make it clear that he isn't doing anything wrong, but that I'm the one who is running out of steam.\n\nThank you to anyone who read this huge post. I didn't realize I would have so much to say on this. I hope this also offers some perspective on *why* some people slowly vanish/disappear: We may not want to end things, but we're just tired, for lack of a better word.",

The sever was historically accurate, keep that in mind as you read this.  \n\n\nSo dude comes in and at first he's fine, he asks a few questions, all is good. Then he makes his character and the character is just...oh my god why dude?  \n\n\nHis character was  a tailor who lived in an attic, and the oc had social anxiety so bad he would burst into tears when any one so much as *glanced* at him. He couldn't be around his father without hysterically crying.  \n\n\nWe told him 'No you cannot have a character with that bad of social anxiety, he'd have been carted off to the asylum already'  \n\n\nHe argued back with 'But another historical server let me have him! The other server said it was ok!' and would keep arguing with that every time we said no. He was eventually banned.  \n\n\n  \nJust because one server let's you do it does not mean another server will let you. Every server has different rules",

            "selftext": "First of all, thankful for finding this sub since it's probably the most appropriate place for this.  I had to edit some details since the rules say not to specify where this happened.\n\nTW: CSA, grooming, suicide\n\nNot sure how cohesive this will be since it's just been sticking in my mind for a couple days and it happened over a decade ago.  It all started with a question \"were you ever m* as a kid?\"  From my wife\n\nAnd well, I guess not, but also it's complicated.  This is stuff that I sort of just glossed over and never thought about because it didn't really seem like a big deal, but the further I go into adulthood the more I empathize with kids and how easily I remember being led astray and shit like that.\n\nI think I must have been between 12-14 when the mmo I was interested in started getting really big.  I had played earlier games, and I loved MMOs, starting with games like Ragnarok Online and Runescape.\n\nSo when I was 12 I asked my parents if I could get a subscription.  They were more than a little put off, especially because my grades were slacking a bit, and investing in a monthly paid service to distract your child just really wasn't something people did back then.\n\nBut I was a pretty tech savvy kid and because of experience from RO, I ended up getting very into private servers for this game.  My dad wasn't thrilled of course, but he did admire my craftiness.\n\nAnyway, private servers back then were extremely hit or miss.  Because of how the game was coded you actually needed programmers on staff to make sure things like raids, boss encounters, dungeons, etc would actually function and work right.  So although I was enjoying \"playing\" this game it wasn't really the same experience as people would talk about in legendary terms that people were familiar with.\n\nSo I got very into roleplaying.  I was very into creative writing and I was excited to jump on the chance to, at the very least, live out a fantasy through text and imagination.  I was also experimenting with identity and well, like I imagine at least some other people going through puberty hormones, I wanted to play a female character and experience that.\n\nSo I made my character an elf mage. Most of the people in my guild were also elves, and I met them at their hideout, extremely excited.\n\nWe became fast friends, I remember becoming friends with \"another\" elf girl \"V\" who ended up taking over as a doting older sister to me.  She was in her twenties or something, and the rest of the guild liked my character.  We would go on tons of adventures, scenarios, romances, weddings, it was community that I had desperately yearned for from a very young age, and this went on for years until I got to HS.\n\nUnfortunately my judgment was about as good as any young teenager  and I ended up doubling down and becoming a catfish.  I didn't want my actual identity as a young boy to mess up my social group, so I would pretend to be one of my female friends who was the same age as me (12-13), and I did tell everyone my age.\n\nEventually things began to unravel because of my relationship to \"V\".  She introduced me to her boyfriend \"J\".  The two of them had a very interesting relationship, and they both seemed very fond of me.  There were many weird happenings like V becoming very romantically involved with not one but 2 other girls in the guild, and with V very strangely pushing me to be involved with J, saying strange things like \"you're much smaller than me so you can do more things with him.\" Now, of course this all seems very sus now, but again, young hormonal teenager and this type of thing wasn't exactly unheard of in RP communities.\n\nAnd, I'm not proud of it, but we started a sexual relationship in the form of cybersex.  I had previously done this once or twice with V, but the two of them kept saying it would be fine to try with J.  I was still a virgin at this point and well, it was a novel experience.  I was hormonal and lonely and in a sick way, even though I wasn't really attracted to men, I found myself yearning for his approval and attention.  Maybe I was attracted to him, or maybe I was just vulnerable, no clue.\n\nEventually, J came clean.  \"V\" was actually his dead girlfriend, who's character he continued to play after she died from cancer.  I don't actually know the veracity of this account of course, since J eventually proved to be a very manipulative and lying person.  He only ever sent me her \"last picture\" as proof where she looked pale and sickly.  This was before you could easily confirm stuff like this through facebook, obituaries etc, or I just didn't know how to do it.\n\nHe told me that he was going to come clean to the whole group and that he was afraid.  Most people did not take it well.  One of the girls \"V\" was involved with was so disgusted she cut off all contact as soon as the confession messages started rolling in.\n\nAnother one of them, A, had apparently been so deeply in love with V that she drove into a wall and killed herself.  Again, this was before everyone online was adding eachother on facebook, so this was just another shocking thing I had no way of confirming.\n\nAnyway, eventually my weird fucked up relationship with J tainted everything I liked about the guild and I cut off contact from everyone without a word one day.  I still feel kind of weird, dirty, for everything that happened and my own part in what transpired.  Anyway thanks for reading my weird story.",

I dislike being* ***manipulated.****\"*\n\nBEFORE I CAN EVEN COMPREHEND THAT, THEY DISCONNECT.\n\nSO I'm left sitting there wondering...did they just not read the small paragraph I made? Or they did read it but they have terrible reading comprehension? Or they saw a paragraph when they were expecting the \n\n* name\n* age\n* hair color\n\nformat of character descriptions?? I was half baffled and half angry but now it just makes me laugh. Every once in a while when something inconveniences me I think \"I dislike being manipulated.\"",

I went with each one of them into every detail for plot, characters etc and when we were ready to start the next day two of them started to ghost me (till today I still dont know why but whatever) and the other two told me that we don't really match although when we were talking they were loving everything, it was all great and couldnt wait to start. \n\nI replied also to 2 guys ad, asking them specifically if they still want to do it and got a place for it and they were like yea sure. Same situation as above, everything planned, the one guy even gives me his schedule with when he is available to RP also giving me possible situations where he would not be online like overtime at work and so on. And few hours later both, yes both of them tells me that they dont really have time for so many RPs right now and they need to drop me off but are all in to RP one day. One of them even kept the invite to the discord server we were suppose to RP and I saw my discord nickname being replaced with some other girls one like seriously? \n\nWhy so many people cant just be honest and tell straight up they dont have time or that they dont like something to the point they dont want to write.",

By all means everything was pretty normal, just your average discussing what era we're doing, all that. Not really any major red flags or anything. So, the person sends me an Imagur link and says \"This is the ship and the uniforms\" the ship is just a normal Intrepid class ship, it might be the one from DS9 I forget, I'm thinking idk why they need an Imagur link when they already said we're going with DS9 uniforms but whatever. So I scroll down to the uniform image, and it's just straight up porn. Like a graphically sexualized version of the DS9 uniforms that covered pretty much nothing, just full nudity, obviously the drawing was just meant to be porn. \n\nThe person gave me no warning, nothing about NSFW content was even discussed but they just sent that with no context or prior discussion. My ad was very clearly not looking for PWP so I have no idea why they think that's what I would want or why the crew would even be wearing these uniforms but seriously there was no discussiom or hunt at NSFW before they went \"These are the uniforms they're wearing\" and sent me porn...

            "selftext": "So there's this one role player on Discord who I have had the unfortunate luck to keep running into over and over and over. We'll just call her \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b.   \n\n\nI first encountered her in this server I made about strippers and mobs in Miami. She joined, did half a scene, then went inactive. When I eventually closed that server, she messaged me almost immediately to ask if she could remake it. I was kind of pissed, ngl. I mean, I don't own strippers, mobs, or Miami, but it was the timing and the notifying me that she was going to do it that bothered me. So she launched it, and idk what happened but within a few months, it was closed again.   \n\n\n A few years later, I found a story very similar to what I'd been trying to make there, so I joined it. I was the first one to make a character, and I brought two friends in. She joined after my writing partner applied and made a character that would effectively be my character's boss. She then beelined for a scene with my writing partner's character. Not a huge deal since despite us pairing our characters, that hadn't happened yet plus we join groups because we like playing with lots of people. it just kind of sussed a little.   \n\n\n But, while my writing partner was doing that scene with her, he was also writing one with my character on what was very clearly a date. I can't say for sure if she was pissed about that, but she just stopped writing immediately and stayed inactive the rest of the time we were in that server.   \n\n\nThat server ended up going under shortly after my friends and I left, for other reasons, and then maybe two weeks later, I found an ad for a new server named after the strip club of that previous server. I was curious to see if it was a relaunch, so I went in and look who was the owner: \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b.   \nThe lore was almost verbatim to what the previous one had been, same city (an AU version of LA), same ethnic mob origin, only this time it was more about the strip club in the city than the mob that owned it.   \n\n\nNot my monkeys, so I left. A bit after that, my writing partner and I made a spin off of my original server based in WPB, FL. We had the Eastern European mob element of soFla, but then we also included a biker-gang mechanic for communities that are actively being gentrified in Florida, like Loxahatchee. And yes, a strip club as the contested territory. Guess who joins? \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b  \n\n\nAt this point, my character is the only stripper. She makes a character who is my character's boss again, but this time chooses a PB that's almost identical, and then for her character's dancer name, she went with something that effectively translates to \"The Better Blonde.\" And again, first scene, she beelines for my writing partner's character. Possibly relevant to note here that my writing partner and I are IRL dating and have been for 3 years. As far as romances go, if we're in a server together, we're paired. No disrespect to others with other styles of relationships, this is just what we like.   \n\n\nEventually, this server goes under and we refocus on our main server. A week later, \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b is back to posting about this other strip club in LA server. I forgot that I'd seen it already, so I joined it again, only this time, her character is my character from the last attempt we did. Same PB, same bio. The only thing she'd changed was her character was now Addison, where my character was Madison.   \n\n\nAnd ALL OF THIS, I've actually talked about here before. But I cut contact with her and she's ban-on-sight in every server I create, so it's been at least a year and a half since I've had to see her up to her old tricks.   \n\n\nSo now we fast forward. My writing partner really wanted to branch out on his own to make his own storyline. I helped with the graphics and posting a few ads, but the lore was entirely his and he was so proud. I was so happy for him. It was admittedly a very niche concept - sort of a spin off / sequel to two plays by William Shakespeare.   \n\n\n\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b slipped in along with a known friend of hers, who we can call \ud83e\uddfe\ud83e\uddea. They didn't apply. They just sat. Eventually they left. Writing Partner ended up rejoining me in my main and fading this concept out because neither of us really had the bandwidth to grow something from the ground up again. No big deal.   \n\n\nThen yesterday, I was just scrolling through reddit and I found something that sounded almost identical to his server. I went in to look it over, since it sounded interesting. And the owners were \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc3b and \ud83e\uddfe\ud83e\uddea. It was the same kind of sequel to the same plays, only this time it was set in France instead of Italy.   \n\n\nNow, I know that the RP community is sort of divided when it comes to Intellectual Property. I personally think that stealing someone else's work is fucked up. If you can't dream up your own concept, then you should stick to fandom RP.   \n\n\nBut damn, it's like this girl lives to leech off other people's creativity, and I don't get it. Where's the fun if EVERYTHING you create is just something you ripped from someone else? I could understand it if she was just *inspired* by something I'd written, but I've seen her copy verbatim - not just my lore for server concepts but my characters, even some of my actual posts, I've seen her copy and paste for her own intros, which is probably the most baffling of all. At that point, you're not even role playing, you're just copying and pasting - where is the fun in that?",

            "selftext": "Alright. So I only got into RP last year, after a person in a fandom I was into offered the chance to RP some popular characters together. I was very nervous and apprehensive, kind of against the idea. it felt too much pressure and I wasn't sure I'd like it at all. \n\n  \nTurned out...I loved it. This person's writing style was very complimentary to mine, and well..it was absolutely addictive and perfect. Fast forward about a year later and thousands upon thousands of epic words together, and I have begun to find myself scared about losing this. \n\nOur exhanges can often be hour upon hour sessions at a time (I have consumed an entire day and night on the RP with them a few times now, and it's always been great fun). But as I find us missing even a mere day or two (and with them being online and not responding to the RP), I find myself getting impatient, agitated, anxious...and just plain sick. Like..are they losing interest? How will I deal if they're losing interest and too polite to tell me? ...How will I even cope without this epic roleplay?  \n\n\nAnd yep....I am completely and terribily aware of how ludicrous/obsessive/dependent I sound. And it's because it's true to a large extent. I basically came to rely on this RP with this RP partner through the shitty covid times and beyond, and we have developed some banter ooc too. I have become so attached to it, that its hard to imagine how I'll go forward when one of us eventually loses interest (and at the moment I'm so fearful it'll be them).  \n\n\nSo I guess my TLDR ask is: How can I prevent myself from sinking further and further into this dependent RP? I know it isn't healthy or normal. Maybe I need to cut it off entirely, just tell them I can't  continue but maybe stay friendly out of the RP? Or try to limit my own replies gradually? Try and wean myself off. But...truth be told, I have so much fun with it still that its hard to imagine myself slowing down with it.  \nAny advice would be helpful, or perspective.",

You know those 'double' partnerships where it feels heavily favored in the side of one individual? Yeah, that's the gist of it. He barely replied to the roleplay where he played female characters for me(And this is a singular roleplay mind you, I didn't have multiple instances where he played them for me! The same can't be said for him though!) yet responded regularly to the *four* roleplays where I played females for *him!* Eventually I stood up for myself and said 'playing females all the time just depresses me, I'm not asking for much but for you to roleplay to my personal rp so we can at least have some balance.\"\n\n\"Yeah sure,\" They say.\n\n\"Okay well I'll stop roleplaying in three of yours until you reply at least once.\" I respond. They reply to the one I continued, I replied to it.... no response for my own rp came, they went quiet after responding to their rp again. Weeks later I ask him if he's still interested as I know he has a busy life, I've been playing on/off with him for years.\n\n\"Yep but I'll reply this weekend!\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I wait, nothing. Bite my tongue and wait. Two weeks later he messages me again. \n\n\"I'll reply this weekend!\" Nothing but he spams the server with pictures of a character in one of the rps I was holding off on until he replied to mine. Clearly hinting what he wanted but he knew the deal, I was willing to keep them going soon as he replied to my own, knowing that if I broke then he'd simply never reply as that's what those people are like. I responded by dropping a few images of a character in my own rp and he responded.\n\n\"Oh I'm on vacation for three weeks, I'll have plenty of time! :)\"\n\nTwo months since then, not a word but he still drops random pics in the server. Finally just called him out and quit, blocking him this time so he can't 'apologize' and just do what he did for a second time(It happened before but I'm too nice and gullible :/ )\n\nIt feels nice being out of that trap but boy is it depressing having zero partners as I keep getting illiterate \"\\*smiles\\*\" on every single ad, everywhere I go\\~",

I try and make this clear in my searches. *Particularly* whenever a theme may involve someone playing a prostitute. Surprisingly enough, just because the character does sex work, doesn't mean I want a smut centric plot. Or that I'm looking to play out kinks. I want a story, and that's very much what I try and advertise in my searches. Of course, people don't care about those specifications and they're gonna come at you with their attempts at ERP and to play out their kinks regardless.\n\nAnyway. The plot was pretty basic but, something along the lines of: A lonely woman seeks company from a male prostitute. Like, emotional company. It was meant to be something focused on character bonding and lonely people finding solace in one another. One person who is very lonely emotionally, and another (the prostitute) who has experience with keeping others company, but ends up building a more emotional relationship with this person. Something like that. \n\nSo, this guy comes at me to do this little plot. He's going to play a male prostitute. We discussed how they're going to meet, yada yada. Roleplay gets started. WELL, turns out, in the starting post, it's his guy's first day on the job........ And he's a virgin. And he'd never even seen boobs before in person. Oh man. Yep. I knew where this was going. \n\nI ended up looking at his post history on that particular site, and basically he liked to play male subs who would have mommy dom take their virginity. \n\nPretty sure that was a reminder that sometimes it's okay to be a little nosy and check people's posting history.\n\nTl;dr Just because someone is looking for mature themes, does not mean they are looking to play out kinks and ERP.",

Servers will say things like \"Well, there's no way to really know, so anyone can do it.\" Or \"It's not like it's porn.\" I'm not sure about legality, but it is definitely ethically wrong no matter how you splice it. It can lead to OOC grooming. Think about it: An adult starts Warping with a 14 year old. The kid thinks they've developed a real relationship with the adult, they get to talking, and they get taken advantage of. He could get nudes, an address, etc. It's dangerous.\n\nAlso most sites don't allow it. For example, I use Discord to RP, which makes it clear in the TOS that sexually explicit content is prohibited for minors.\n\nThis isn't a harmless issue, it's bad practice, unethical, and dangerous. If you know a server or group is practicing this, speak up. If they don't fix it, leave and don't encourage or validate it. And definitely don't participate.\n\nIn conclusion, these horny mofos need to get their crap together.\n\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk.",

I had this RP partner that until last nigh everything between us was going wonderfully, we had a great rp going on, both of us mentioned in multiple occasions we were enjoying it. As things usually go we got to know each other's tastes better, so we were planning on starting a second one as well so we could switch between them from time to time. We were supposed to start the new one tomorrow, but when I opened discord today I found out I were kicked from our server and he had blocked me, no explanation, no motive given. \n\nThis hurts a lot I mean not to even explicitly say \"I don't feel like playing with you anymore\"",

I have been suspecting they've gone onto new roleplays which I'm fine with, it's just the vanishing has left me unable to help myself but assume the most negative things. We've been on-and-off for awhile now and had a roleplay in the summer, but since school's started they've pretty much been on hiatus. I've known this person for a few years now and they've just popped up whenever and talk, but this just feels different to me. \n\n It's actually been months since I last messaged them (I was the last to speak), but I recently messaged them a link to a roleplay advertisement server I recommended a little while before because the old one got deleted and that was about it. We've always been friendly towards one another, popping up at random times and vice versa since life gets hectic. The part that's both bothering and mortifying me is that  I recently accidentally liked an unrelated post they made on mobile and I feel like a clingy ex-girlfriend. I didn't mean to like it, but I did and it feels awful. I feel like I might be bugging them right now because I know they're very busy in college. I don't care about the roleplay as much as I do their perception of me I suppose??? I don't want to seem like the bad rper or get blocked. I just wanna know we're on good terms. \n\nI hate that I can't help but assume the worst about something or make it personal??? Like I really have a nagging fear of outright being hated or annoying, so I honestly don't get close to my roleplay partners that much - I know they're not obligated to respond to me or give me a heads up, I don't want a heads up or anything like that - but the crippling embarrassment of accidentally appearing clingy has left me reeling. I don't wanna message them *again* just to apologize cause that'll just make things worse, but not saying anything feels so awkward ugh I hate ittt.",

In hindsight, it's also a prompt that we had talked about doing many, many months ago but never got around to. Our writing styles meshed well and I thought we were both having a good time until he simply...stopped coming online or responding both OOC and IC. I unfriended him and moved on. \n\nFast forward a few weeks later, I get this immense apology letter in my inbox on my alternate account(!!!) that he somehow discovered and I decide, foolishly, to give him a second chance despite the blow to my self-confidence I'd already suffered. I know deep down we all get anxious and self-conscious when we get ghosted, and I'm no different; for a little bit, I was convinced it was me or my writing that drove him off. \n\nSo we start writing together again, we're both having a really good time until he just disappears. No warning, no slowly falling interest level, just gone. I legitimately thought something terrible had happened to him the first time, it was so abrupt, but the second time? Hell no. I messaged him and told him not to contact me again. Now, I see him back on Reddit, and I know him by his writing style and his choice of prompts that he posts, and I'm just so bloody irritated at the audacity, knowing that he's going to do this to someone else. \n\nTLDR: got ghosted twice by the same dude because I don't learn and now he's trawling Reddit again like nothing happened, looking for his next victim.",
