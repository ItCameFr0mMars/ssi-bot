            "selftext": "So this is a thing that happened to me recently. I write roleplay prompts that inspire me in a moment. This one was based on a war between two elven nations. It's focuses on the generals of the armies. Both masked individuals who's identities are only known by their respective royalties. It was supposed to not focus on the fighting but instead on the relationship between the two when my character is captured by theirs and taken back into the realm that the enemy kingdom lives. \n\nIt was supposed to focus on the idea of a fruitless war, how both characters would realize how stubborn their royalties were and why not try and find a way to stop this. Jaded Generals of a Hundred year war who are slowly coming to realize how fruitless that venture truly is. \n\nOf course the beginning would be rocky. They hate each other. They can not get along and my character was a prisoner to the other. \n\nBut. \n\nIn my limits I clearly started,  I didn't want a large focus on death, gore, the icky stuff, the grooling sort of stomach twisting acts that stem from war (in great detail) I just don't like to touch on and I carefully made sure to word the roleplay prompt (it was rather lengthy before I just wanted to make sure I got the point across that this is what I'm looking for) \n\nI always make sure to say that if a limit is crossed I won't respond to the first message or just end the conversation then and there. *because I have tried to talk about it with those who crossed my limits and they just kept pushing and pushing so I learned my lesson and just cut things off then and there* \n\nI also made sure to state that if they wished they could respond to the prompt with an rp response that way I can also see how they write, what they do, and they and I can discuss if we wanted to.)\n\nOnce i finished, I posted the prompt and waited. Then came the responses. Some were good, then there was one. One that was a very literate response (I don't mind that) that just. It took the roleplay on a whole spin. \n\n1. Controlling my character. Making them do all sorts of things until they ended up being taken to a strong hold. \n\n2. Forcing my character to do things they didnt want to do. \n\n3. Murdering the troops that came to rescue them (all in excruciating detail via the use of poisonous arrows) \n\n4. Then. Making her swear off her elven magical ties to her kingdom this rendering her in a very close to mindless state because of the effects. \n\nAll of which I literally had to scroll through cause it was LONG and then they ended it with (This is fairly summarized) \"hi! I read your prompt and I loved it! This is my response to the rp and I can not wait to roleplay with you!\" \n\n\n..... because of the fact that... I'm just soft. It made me thing that they didn't mean it in ill will. \n\nBut they literally took the roleplay on a whole different path than what it was supposed to be.\n\nCrossing my limits. \nControlling my character \nAnd just. \nIt itches under my skin. \n\nI don't get what inspires people to do this. If they even chose to read the prompt or just sees the title, the first three lines and go \"oh I understand!\" And waddle off to type out something that just. Does everything \nW r o n g. \n\nTell me what you think. \n\nIt just. \n\nIt gets under my skin and I have much more bad rp stuff to talk about. This is just one that happened recently.",

I love a good violent action scene when it's done right. My partners character was a sort of a bloodthirsty demon that possessed the body of a normal woman, only coming out to fulfill deals she made with people. Basically, she's a demon hitman. Anyhow, my character was an attorney that had a few disgruntled clients in the past, so the plot was that she would be hired to take him out, and the others who were trying to kill him. I thought it sounded fun, so I agreed  \n\n\nFast forward to the scene, where her first 3 responses are very graphic and in detail descriptions about how she murdered my character's attackers with various weapons, cutting them in different, very specific places. She writes in first person, which gives the whole thing a very fanfiction-y vibe, especially when she talks about licking blood off daggers and talking about how death turns her on. I don't mind this kind of stuff when it's done tastefully, but she way she describes gore and murder makes me feel like I'm reading a bad creepypasta. While not ideal, I can deal with all of this. What I can't deal with however, is her controlling my character, making him do stuff like gag at the sight of blood or scream because he got a knife stuck in him. That is something that I cannot deal with, even with something as small as that. I'm considering dropping the roleplay and just telling her that our styles don't match.",

The problem is every response they send involves either dragging my character from scene to scene, or already assuming what my characters reaction is going to be before I even get the chance to respond.\nI\u2019ve already asked them once, they seemed to feel bad about it and said they were worried their responses would be too short if they didn\u2019t move my character around, and overall it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\nBUT THERE STILL DOING IT and it\u2019s getting more and more on my nerves.\n\nThe thing is though the whole rp is a world they made, I just inserted my character into it. So maybe this is normal and I\u2019m in the wrong for being annoyed by it? \n\nEither way I don\u2019t want to bother them by asking them AGAIN if they can cool it a little, but I don\u2019t just want to let it go either since it\u2019s sucking some of the fun out of the rp for me. \n\nSo I guess my question is am I in the wrong, and if I\u2019m not how should I address the issue without hurting their feelings?",

            "selftext": "I was just reminded of something kind of amusing that happened a few years ago.  I had just found a new partner and and I posted a starter for the roleplay we planned.    They rewrote the starter from my character's POV.  It didn't really change anything.  Just sort of repeated what I said in a slightly different way and then continued with an otherwise normal response from her character.\n\nI thought it might have something to do with my starter (they're always so tricky) so I shrugged it off posted a reply.  The same thing happened again.\n\nTo give you a better idea, I'd write: \"John sat on the wooden bench, carefully peeling an orange as he watched the birds.\"\n\nThey'd reply: \"John peeled an orange while watching the birds from the wooden bench.  Ben walked down the road humming to himself.\" \n\nI'd reply: \"John waved to Ben and gave him a hearty greeting.  He was happy to see his friend and it showed in his smile. It had been some time since they'd last seen each other and he was excited to catch up.\"\n\nThey'd reply: \"John smiled when he saw Ben, his happiness written all over his face.  This was the first time they had met in years.  He greeted his friend heartily.  Ben smiled back and said hello.  He sat on the bench next to John.\"\n\nNow imagine my replies are around 500ish words.  They would rewrite the entire thing before writing the equally long response from their character's POV.\n\nI thought it was kind of odd so, after a few posts, I asked if there was a reason they were doing it and if they'd like me to also structure my replies the same way.  They immediately dropped from the server and blocked me.  It was of those things that leave you scratching your head.",

            "selftext": "Let me set the story, Me (B), R, and S (The bad rper in this case). Were in a roleplay server together, S had this character, she was a corrupt gardevoir and me and R\u2019s OC\u2019s (With some help from N\u2019s ocs) were going to save her. My OC got killed in the process but I didn\u2019t mind since it was me and R\u2019s plan, now what does this have to do with a bad rper? Well I befriended R and S (was friends with N already.) So I invited them to my RP server at was serious. Everything went well until R was getting angry at S, S was being non serious and messing around. One point in the prestory S used the corrupt gardevoir (but human due to the way the RP worked), and ate a door. I\u2019m not joking. So R dmed me and I tried to help since I was tied between the two, being both their friends, the best I could do was say for him to ignore S. A few days later the story started. The other owner V reached out to me too and said he had the same problem as R S. Now there were two people on neutral terms with S, Z, someone who was quite similar to S but we made up and became friends, and Y, another friend who helped me though we are not in touch as much today. So due to R and V\u2019s anger I decided to remove S\u2019s roleplayer role for a short while, which I admit was a bit of an asshole move from me. Then S got pissed and left, which we were all happy about. Now what about N? Well in N\u2019s server all stars was going on. And S was in it. Now my memory is a bit blurry but S got pissed there too and was banned by N, V was a mod in that server by the way. In another server S also got mad at me and got mad in another \u201cfriends\u201d server. (The \u201cfriend\u201d attacked N but that\u2019s a whole other off topic story.) though This story has a happy-ish ending. S recovered for the most part and became a co-owner in a friends server. And he\u2019s doing better now. So that\u2019s the end of this weird story. I hope you enjoy it.",

            "selftext": "I'm so glad I found this sub and have a place to tell all my stories. Most come down to being annoying. But there are some who stand on the line of annoying and bad right before they take a swan dive into bad. I had a great time in the community as you can tell. \n\nWhat's today's story? If you've read the title you should know a bit about what I'm going to tell you. \n\nBack during my RP days I joined a group, and I met... we'll call him Luke. Luke's oc was a chosen one prince who was half of two kingdoms and they were at war. Something about a goddess needing saving. Then rinse and repeat the Legend of Zelda for a while. I was intrigued personally, but it might have been because I'm a Zelda fan and a sucker for war stories, no, I'm not kidding. We'll call this oc... Moon. Moon was okay, until he started treating everyone around him like babies who can't do shit without him.\n\nMoon found interest in any oc who was under the age of UNKNOWN or anyone I made. He'd baby talk them, try to feed them, or carry them, and treated the school (full of teenagers to adults) like his personal daycare. Anytime someone would complain, Luke would say \"it's just his character\" or \"he's 100 years old, so it's okay.\" Remember when I said rinse and repeat the Legend of Zelda? I specifically mean Breath of the Wild. Moon got annoying, and he didn't specify the age to who was a \"baby\" and who was an \"adult,\" so he treated everyone like a baby and we had no idea what to do.\n\nI made demon siblings, 24 and 26, who were orphans and raised themselves. Moon took that to call them \"precious babies,\" said he was \"adopting\" them, and going to \"protect\" them.\n\nI wouldn't be sharing this story if Luke accepted that we didn't like Moon treating our ocs as babies, and to an extent, his property. Or if Moon's arc was about learning to treat everyone as an equal. But Luke ignored us because of his stupid fantasy that everyone is a baby who needs to be loved and cared for by Moon. I had to pull out of the RP. My ocs weren't allowed anywhere without him or able to do anything without his permission. He became less of a \"big brother\" and more of an abusive spouse. He cut them off from everything so they relied on him, and Luke saw that as \"cute parenting.\" \n\nHe did that to everyone, not letting anyone's oc do anything outside of what he wanted them to do. Moon was \"protecting them\" so it was \"okay.\" When people complained, he'd see nothing wrong with what he was doing. When he was told to cut it out by the mods, he wouldn't do a thing. And my favorite, when someone  came along and did the exact same thing as him, he would complain about how insensitive they were being and how that isn't good for relationships, even if they were fictional. So, bonus points for having no self-awareness.  \n\nTLDR:\n\nLuke made a character, Moon, who's intentions were to be a parent to everyone. But since no one wanted that, it turned into a war zone. Luke refused to acknowledge that people didn't want their ocs being treated as babies and Moon's property. And when someone else did it, he complained about it with no self-awareness.",

            "selftext": "Hello, hello! I\u2019ve been Rping for quite some time, over a decade at this point, and I\u2019ve experienced a number of things in my time; here I have a story that spans over quite a number of years strangely enough, a fellow Rper that I\u2019ve had the \u2018pleasure\u2019 of writing with either twice or thrice. I apologize in advance for the length. \n\nHere is the tale of Kevin. \n\nNow, Kevin was the name of the character and I\u2019m pretty sure the name of the writer. How do I know? It can be easy to spot an author insert, especially when you have a name like Kevin in an Rp taking place in the Victorian Era. \n\nThis was where I first met Kevin, it was open and if I can recall right the story I had in mind was this: two sisters attacked by Jack the Ripper, one dies and the other is saved by a vampire, and this leads her onto a path of vengeance and uncovering a dark secret within the city; of course the name Kevin made sense in this time period. For sure. Yep. Such a classic name. \n\nKevin. \n\nOh, what else? You\u2019re adding ninjas\u2026Kevin practicing the ninja art. Some dude named Kevin and ninjas\u2026yes. Makes total total sense- I let this one slide a bit because hey, it could have been interesting; spoiler it wasn\u2019t interesting. \n\nNathaniel joined not long after, Nathaniel understood the assignment. We like Nathaniel, he\u2019s great and his character is actually likable. \n\nKevin for some reason had this urge to be like\u2026the alpha dog for some reason. Like hackles raised and puffing out his chest at Nathaniel. And remember the dead sister? Like she\u2019s dead, dead and gone- Kevin keeps trying to revive her. Thinking about it now it\u2019s like \u2018 Okay Frankenstein-esque monster could be cool\u2019 but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how he wanted it and I didn\u2019t really want that at the time- she was literally a character I had made to die. I also think I had it where she\u2019d come back eventually with something taking her form, so her but not her, but this was all a long time ago. \n\nWithout even really saying it, Nathaniel and I were both kind of annoyed with Kevin taking everything off the rails and trying to make it all about him and him being the hero, getting the girl, and ultimately being the chosen one. \n\nAfter it appeared more that my character and Nathaniel got along more, Kevin just kind of vanished because he wasn\u2019t at the center of attention. \n\nI tried to look up the Rp just to get a full refresher on just HOW bad it had been, but alas I believe it is gone forever- but I did find other things. \n\nA lot of characters that are supposed to be teens-young adults that have face claims of men in their forties, and no it\u2019s not like forty year olds that play twenty year olds, they are forty year olds that look and smell forty. All named Kevin; ethnicity, time period, or place doesn\u2019t matter. All Kevin, all the time. \n\nNow we flash forward a few years. \n\nI join this group Rp, everyone in it is female or identifies as female. In joins Kevin, I get flashbacks and I\u2019m like \u2018 Oh fucking great\u2019 and I am not disappointed, he hasn\u2019t changed. I didn\u2019t mention the flat writing previously, his writing his flat and too short for the details he\u2019s just bombing down on everyone. \n\nThis iteration of Kevin knows martial arts/jutsu, comes from a Hell\u2019s Angels family, and looks like the stereotypical boney nerd. First few times he posts he\u2019s not playing with the rest of the class, he\u2019s lamenting to himself and not joining any of the action/trying to strike up conversations with the others. That is until one of the others writes in that her OC gets verbally harassed by another character she\u2019s writing, then he\u2019s all \u2018 M\u2019Lady Mode\u2019, he gets thanked for just telling the dude off even though the character handled herself in the first place, and then he goes back to not talking with anyone else, even when we tried to get him involved. \n\nIt really felt like he wanted us to bite into whatever he was cooking up, mentioned something about \u2018 investigating missing kids\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018 Interesting if it were another Rp but that\u2019s not what we had all discussed previously!\u2019. Finally he tried and failed to create chemistry with a character he had interacted with only once. Just once, it was very cringe to say the least.  Then it all just petered out after that\n\nAs a bonus, I had a friend on the same website that also dealt with Kevin so I asked her about her experiences, she\u2019s allowed me to share it and I feel like this is icing on the cake. \n\nApparently he\u2019d consistently try to RP with her, even though she\u2019d tell him no and she wasn\u2019t comfortable with Rping with men at the time- which is a whole other story. He said she was discriminating against him and reported her to the moderators\u2026and that\u2019s that. I say she dodged a bullet because at one point Kevin was called out by someone for using anime related stuff in non-anime related Rps. \n\nAnd that, my friends, concludes the story of our dearest Kevin; the man with an ego so large yet oh so fragile.",

            "selftext": "I'm not going to beat around the bush, I hate Mary Sues. But, what's my definition of them? Well, a Mary Sue is a character who is the center of the universe, they're better than everyone else, all events in the world are about them, everyone who disagrees with them are evil, they have no flaws, or their flaw is \"being too perfect,\" they're allowed to do anything they want and they'll be worshipped for it, and they're called the new lord and savior for just existing. Now I feel like I just described a Karen's kid.\n\nI'm going to be use the same names I made up in this story (https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/qqb6na/these_two_are_the_reason_i_dont_rp_publicly/), so let's get on with it. \n\nI mentioned that I role played with Cam and her oc Frost, I actually had multiple experiences with her and I'm here to tell you about a specific story. For naming purposes, my oc will be called Sara. Sara was the leader of a resistance group against the bad guys; she had been fighting since she was young after her parents were killed, and she formed the group with other people to free their home. Most of us were chill, we would role play certain scenes then wait for the members of the bad guy team to reply. And then Frost entered.\n\nI never mentioned what Frost was when I made the summary in my last post, well, Frost was a blue and white anthropomorphic cat with deer legs and bear claws. None of us found out until we saw Cam draw her, because we all thought she was human like everyone else. But the second we knew what she was we tried to tell Cam that the RP was for humans. And Cam threw a fit about it.\n\nWe ended up leaving it after a mod tried to work Frost into the story. I believe the compromise was that she was an experiment who escaped the facility. But that taught Cam she could do whatever she wanted and the mods would back her up. So, she started her killing spree of random people's ocs because Frost needed to be \"dark and edgy.\" \n\nFrost met Sara in the forest, and the first interaction was \"she killed Sara immediately and laughed insanely as she kept stabbing.\" To which the mod deleted her message, told her to quit it, and let me start. I tried to have a decent role play about Sara and Frost's relationship, and you can imagine how hard it was with Frost never shutting up about how she's better than everyone else. Frost was a better fighter than Sara with a fraction of the experience, could use Sara's weapon better than Sara could, and if the topic wasn't about her, she'd flip out. \n\nIn fact, if no one was talking about Frost, she'd flip. Cam expected us to make everything we did center around Frost. All the bad guys plans had to be about stopping her or killing her, all the good guys were supposed to worship her, NPCs were supposed to only talk about her. We could not have a story unless it centered around Frost and it pissed off everyone. And when we told Cam that she needed to tone down how important Frost was compared to everyone else, she claimed we were being selfish and didn't care about anyone but ourselves. Because irony is the best. \n\nYou'd think that was the end. No, we still have a lot to cover. Frost didn't ever stop being the worst character in the RP. She was on a third team and, of course, didn't need teammates (defeating the purpose of a TEAM) because she was so much better than everyone else. She couldn't kill players anymore, so she went to one-hit killing NPCs. And being a dark and edgy was so important to Cam that she made Frost constantly stab herself and laugh at it. Don't worry, she's immortal, invincible, and immune to all negative effects. Literally NOTHING can hurt her, not even mentally because she's so FULL OF HERSELF. \n\nThe next time Sara met Frost was during a monster hunt, we were going to kill a big monster and we let her tag along. Of course, in Mary Sue fashion, Frost killed it instantly and expected us to praise her. She then made a storyline where she had to kill a person in her hometown and we didn't have anything else to do since that scene was supposed to be longer, so we went with it. She killed the NPC instantly, I don't think I need to say more than that. \n\nThe final straw that got people was when Cam wanted Frost to be an evil god. Which the mods said no because gods were never part of the story, and she did it anyway. Frost became the embodiment of evil and held dark powers that no one could fight against. She was like the final boss in a JRPG but if the developers gave up on making a good story. She didn't even have a proper boss battle because a mod had to god mode his oc out of no where just to deal with her bullshit. I'm not kidding, that's the lengths he had to go through to stop her from taking over the RP. \n\nI'm so sorry if this was a mess, it's hard to describe Frost without going on tangents about how bad she is. Modern day Frost isn't any better, I've read a story where she was an evil god and it's just people worshipping her and being killed if they don't. Maybe someone could turn what happened in the group into a good story, but it won't be made by Cam.",

He had *zero* idea what a chauffer for the Don even did. He had his character on the other side of town trying to get drunk, when he was told both in and out of character to get to the Don as he's suppose to be at the Don's house he said 'Oh I didn't know that's what I was suppose to do', he messaged the owner and asked what exactly he was suppose to do because and I quote 'I just picked chauffer because I liked how it sounded'   \n\n\nThen he did the two things that finally made the owner just give up on him and ban him. First thing he did was have his character go to the Don's house, barge in without knocking, and call the Don by his first name.  \n\n\nThen he messaged the owner and told her 'Here you be my character now, I'm going to make him a wife and I want someone to play off of'  \n\n\nI lost braincells that day.",

Although, that doesn't mean I don't still have my urges to jump back in.

Besides, a lot of the discord servers that I come across seem to be one-liners and full of kids. As someone who turns 31 this week, I'm not exactly interested in role-playing with kids. \n\nFor the past few days, I've been looking at chatroom apps to itch that role play craving. I found my way to Amino but I'm hesitant to give it a try. From what I've heard, it's mostly cringey teenagers role-playing emotion anime or wolf characters.\n\nCan anyone in here tell me about Amino?

We've done a bunch of different settings together &amp; also took some breaks here &amp; there. Our last break was around 5 months long &amp; we just started to RP again. \n\nUsually he likes to write openers, but this time he asked me to write one, after I came up with about 90% of our new plot. I didn't want to write the opener this time, because I already wrote the last 2 openers in our RPs, but he wouldn't do it, so I said ''fuck it'' &amp; wrote one like he asked me to. \n\nHe read the opener, he liked it, he said he is writing his reply *now* because he would really love to get few posts done tonight, since he missed our RPs. About 2 hours in, I'm still waiting for his post. He keeps texting me OOC, asking me stuff about the characters, the plot, this &amp; that. About another hour later he sends me his post. So I read what he sent me &amp; I'm wondering what the hell is going on. He wrote multiple paragraphs just filled with details about a specific area of the city in which our RP takes place. He described the buildings, the people, even how the police acts, but nothing really about our characters or anything that has to do with my opener. Actually he didn't write anything that I could work with &amp; give a reply to. \n\nFor clarification: in my opener I did write about the area of our RP, I did fill it with details, explained the visuals, sounds, smells, the people, just everything, before I moved on to the actual plot. So I don't really understand why he would do it again &amp; add nothing else to keep the flow of the RP itself.\n\nTo be honest I am annoyed with this situation, so I called it a night &amp; went offline. I would get it if a complete new RP partner messed up like this, because we never know what to expect from total strangers. But this guy has been my partner for several years..\n\nSo yea, this is my vent of the day lol",

They write on public threads and I have slowly started writing on public threads as well, excited that I had built up the confidence to finally write where others can see. The problem is that I find myself getting really insecure and jealous now when a partner of mine responds to someone else first. The partner I was referring to above does this and we have a few other partners that we have stories with as well. It hurts me to see them responding to one another faster and makes me question my writing abilities. I will go back and obsess over every detail of my post wondering what it is that I have done wrong, or what it is that I need to improve on. I do not think of myself as a terrible writer whatsoever and logically I understand that some people will just prefer one story to the next. My question is how do I deal with these feelings of insecurity and stop taking such things so personally.",

            "selftext": "So this one is probably more of an Am I The Asshole post than a bad rper story but here we go anyway\n\nSo I had this guy (not naming names) who responded to a post I made wanting to do a rp with me. It was about a character from the game ace Attorney that I was looking to do a rp with and I must say it was going pretty well, I gotta admit. \n\nBut then after a short while, he wanted to stop the rp and do a rp with different characters. At first I was like \u201cno, I wanna do this one, you responded looking for this one, what are you doing\u201d but he insisted on it, he insisted he wanted to do a new one. So we continued the rp he asked for in the first place for a bit before I got bored and agreed to change rps and again. It was gong well, there were a few issues here and there but I was alright \n\nThen..the problems emerge. First I wanted to go to sleep but he wanted me to try and stay awake and claimed he wanted me to \u201cchallenge myself\u201d then I forgot the rp was there and he constantly bugged me about it, then when I tried to leave him cause I got bored and wanted to rp elsewhere, he tried to stop me and literally begged me to stay. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I snapped. I vented all my anger onto him, he tried to promise he will change but in my eyes, the damage was done and there was nothing he could do to fix it. I told him I was sorry and I unfriended him and closed the dm chat\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, reddit. Im not sure I did the right thing or not as I felt as tho I was kinda too harsh on him, he wanted a second chance but I refused it for him, even tho I myself have begged for second chances before (even worse with certain partners), he showed me his commitment when I forgot the rp by prompting a response from me and I basically told him to fuck off and.. I dunno, Reddit. What\u2019s your take?",

            "selftext": "These are stories I like to tell back when I used to publicly role play, they happened right next to each other, so I tell them together, and well... they're just amusing in my opinion. \n\nPerson 1:\n\nPerson 1 was well-known in the community I ventured in, she had the worst written stories and her character was so Mary Sue it hurt people to RP with her. Let's call her Cam. I met Cam when she joined the group and she seemed chill, she had a few problems with other people but we tended to ignore her since she wasn't outright harassing them. She made her oc Frost and that was when everything turned to shit. Frost had many iterations, becoming worse and worst in each one. Even when she asked for criticism and got it, Cam refused to give a single shit about other people's opinions. Which is weird as hell cause no one would have said anything if she didn't ask.\n\nFrost became the staple of how not to write, and now is the time I tell you about her. Her backstory was that she was living a perfect life until her sister said \"you suck,\" to which Frost ran away, screaming about abuse. She lived on the streets for two weeks where she learned how to fight and was better than everyone else at it. Then, and I'm not kidding this is in her description, \"for some reason she became the most powerful being the in universe.\" Just about everyone in the group was screaming when that showed up. But we're not done, Frost was stronger than everyone else, could use all their powers but better, could use every weapon flawlessly, and could kill anyone by touching them because of how powerful she was. When Cam was asked to make Frost a little less stupidly overpowered, Cam added the flaw of \"having a broken soul.\" \n\nIn RP, Frost would immediately try to kill a person's character before breaking down and crying about how hard her life is and \"please feel sorry for me, I'm just a baby who needs love.\" Which gave everyone whiplash. Cam was asked multiple times to revise Frost for the story, as she tended to not follow any plot in favor of her oc being at the top, and she cried about unjustified hate. Which, I don't blame them. I did an RP with Cam once and... three of my ocs were brutally murdered before they got to say \"hi,\" one of their houses was lit on fire for no reason, and the last one... let's just say I had to change things to a hologram speaking because \"she kept stabbing (oc)\" was every other line. And before I forget, one of the things Frost did when people were tired of her stabbing them was to stab herself and then JOKE about self-harm.\n\nCam wasn't taking any comments about her oc that weren't, \"your oc is perfect and amazing,\" something that no one was saying. So, she took to complaining to the mods about how people were being mean to her \"for no reason.\" (It was because they didn't like that her oc was killing theirs in the first two seconds.) Most of the \"mean comments\" were \"please don't kill my oc so quickly\" or \"please play along with the story.\" And then she was kicked after she cried about being an unjustified victim.\n\nPerson 2:\n\nApril, let's roll with that name, was the other person who was causing trouble. She was much nicer than Cam, even offering to make a story for the group using our RP. (Which was actually a ploy to steal our characters, but that's a story for another time.) Her oc was Star, a noble girl who had everything she ever wanted but dreamed for more. That description wasn't to everyone's liking, but I could roll with it since one of my favorite game characters starts off similarly. And then the RP started and we found out just how bad Star was. \n\nShe threw temper tantrums when she didn't get her way and cried about how \"evil\" someone was for not bowing down to her. Some poor soul played as her mother and when she was asked to study for a test, she cried about being abused. The person who played her father didn't get have any better luck, she would cry about him not giving her \"good enough gifts\" everyday, making him pure evil. To which both people dropped out after the first day. In other RP stories, Star would complain about her horrible life, even when no one asked. She would say how her parents were pure evil and she was innocent angel who could never do anything wrong. The reason for coming to the magic school, (did I forget to say that was the premise? Oops) was because she wanted to learn magic to \"fix\" her horrible life conditions. Yes, the oc who was described as getting everything she ever wanted had \"horrible life conditions\" because two people didn't want to RP as characters who bowed down to her. I love life, isn't it great?\n\nStar wasn't as bad as Frost, I'll give you that. She never one-hit killed anyone or joked about self-harm, but she did have zero consideration for other people. And I would love to say it was just the character being a little shit and she's meant to be hated, but then April started showing the same behaviors and my hope crash landed into the Bermuda Triangle. April had many complaints about her ocs being the same person with a different name, something Cam also suffered from. She made ocs who were nobles or extremely powerful with their one flaw being their \"horrible life.\" And I'm sure you can already guess she means that one or two people didn't bow down to her oc as their new god. She wasn't good with talking to the other people either, she reported messages mildly complaining about her oc, or ones where people didn't want to RP with her. Would you want to RP with someone who's going to call you \"evil\" for not bowing down to them? No? Me neither.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThese two were hell to deal with. From ocs who were impossible to play with unless the universe centered around them to creators who couldn't take the slightest bit of criticism. Even when the mods told them not to act like little shits they would cry victim and pretend that people were after them \"for no reason.\" I joined the RP to have fun, not to hear how an oc is better than everyone else so should be treated like a god. I have enough experience from kids doing that in real life, I don't need that in RP.",

            "selftext": "Much like roleplay in general, writing character backstories for a roleplay is so much different than for a story. I've struggled to write backstories for as long as I've roleplayed.  I tend to write backstories in the third-person and I can have all these amazing ideas, but it's too much to compact into a summary. I've had people compliment my lengthy backstories and wish their new character wasn't so short in comparison, but I just can't shake off the feeling it's too much. A lot of roleplayers skim backstories or don't read them at all. I feel like longer backstories are more likely to get skimmed than short ones.\n\nI love character writing. Problem is I can't seem to make it *short*. My longest backstory now is about 1-2 pages of writing, but it feels too long in comparison to everywhere else I see. I know most of my roleplay partners introduce new characters, so of course they won't be as detailed - but I just hate standing out, y'know? I don't want it to feel rushed, but I don't want it to feel terribly long either.\n\nYou also can't really give a good sense of time in writing characters backstories like this - Or at least, I haven't figured out a way that does? What happened a decade ago doesn't come off as a decade since the reader has read someone's whole life story in only a couple minutes. \n\nSo, how do you guys handle backstories?",

            "selftext": "(NOTE: April is a made up name I gave someone. Don't worry, I always use fake names in my stories.)\n\nI don't think Frost's throne of being the biggest Mary Sue is going to be toppled anytime soon, at least from someone I've met. But I guess god complexes are a good substitute. \n\nApril, the one who made a Mary Sue that cried when people didn't worship her. Okay, that describes all Mary Sues, let me try again. The one who made Star, a character so entitled that she called her mom abusive for wanting her to study and her dad evil for not giving her a good enough gift. Seeing as that was the first oc April made and landmines can take pressure better than her, you can guess the next one isn't going to be any better.  \n\nThe RP: \n\nAcorn was a copied and pasted version of Star, but in a camp setting. The story was about kids who ran away from home, got caught up in some magic, and turned into hybrids of animals in a new world. Please make a list of every isekai you know because we'll come back to it later.\n\nAcorn became the central character of the story, she was the only one who pushed the plot forward, and everyone else was sidelined. She became the camp leader and basically made a cult surrounding her. Anyone who wasn't okay with it was thrown out for being \"pure evil\" and demonized. No one was allowed to make decisions or do anything without her permission, she controlled everything they did and I mean EVERYTHING. \n\nThen, April decided it was a good idea to ask people if she could make a story out of the RP using their characters and didn't even wait for them to respond before doing it anyway. And this is where I came into the picture. I typically avoided Acorn because of the god complex she had but thought it wouldn't be a problem if I was just editing the document. I don't think I need to get into the first chapter because it was just Acorn talking about how she's a perfect angel. \n\nThe stealing of characters: \n\nThe issues started happening when April thought that using people's ocs in the story meant she owned them. People weren't happy about that, they were adamant on not letting her make their oc a mindless drone to serve her oc. To which she insulted them for being bad writers. The hypocrisy isn't going to stop anytime soon. \n\nI remember one conversation I had with her where I was making a story while waiting on the document, she wanted to see it, and something in her little peanut brain told her that I was making it for her and she owned the assets. She wanted to know about the inspiration for the story, I told her, and she insulted me for not being \"purely original\" and said \"I know, like everyone else, you can't just spit out ocs.\" I found out she said those so I would drop the project and she could steal it. Great partner to work with, would recommend.  \n\nEventually the admin found out, he had been gone due to personal issues, and shut April down. Saying she didn't own the ocs people made for his story, didn't own anything I made just because she wanted it, and didn't like how she turned his RP group into a cult worshipping her oc. She insulted his story, calling it \"unoriginal\" because it was just like Jumanji and only losers have such unoriginal ideas. Now, go to that list of isekai that you made in the beginning, see all the people who are now \"losers\" because of how \"unoriginal\" they are. \n\nApril finally got her ass kicked off. Making a Mary Sue is one thing, trying to steal people's ocs then insulting them in hopes they'll give it to her is another. I could probably go on forever about how she kept stealing people's ocs in other groups while bitching that no one appreciates \"purely original\" stories anymore. But I think you get enough from that statement alone. \n\nI had a lot of terrible experiences with role players, maybe next time I'll talk about the guy who joined a fantasy role play, and somehow thought that insulting everyone who wasn't making their oc a sailor from the 1400s was a good idea. I was a mod in that server, which was a blast because I was the only one who didn't excuse his bullying with mental illness. But we'll talk about that later.",
