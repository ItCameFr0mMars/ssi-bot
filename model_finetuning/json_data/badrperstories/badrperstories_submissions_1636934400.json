We\u2019ve had this RP going for over two years now and it had been a great source of inspiration and a great distraction. \n\nOur characters are gods in this universe. My characters that were supposed to be very powerful gods were downgraded to minor gods. I didn\u2019t care because our characters were equal, but then they created new characters and suddenly they were the rulers of our universe. I was never asked. I let it go, but as time went on I became frustrated with this. I finally decided I\u2019m going to have my own powerful character, a couple of them, in this universe or I\u2019m going to quit. I said I wouldn\u2019t make them more powerful than their most powerful characters. I said I\u2019d create a believable story for them that would not contradict any of what we have now, but it caused a giant fight and ended with them telling me to do as I please, but what\u2019s the point if they\u2019ve decided decided they hate my story without ever reading it? I just want to feel that this is my world as much as it his theirs. \n\nWe\u2019ve continued it but I\u2019m just no happy with it anymore and idk how to approach it without fighting. This person is my best friend and it sucks that we\u2019re fighting over this",

They were so kind, so intelligent, just a truly wonderful person OOC. \n\nAnd then I got bored. Told him I was ending our RP. He was extremely accepting of this, and told me how I wouldn\u2019t be replaceable to write the character the way I did. That really meant something to me. \n\nI came back after a while, and messaged him. He replied almost immediately, told me how much he\u2019d hoping that I came back. And it was amazing. And then I decided I\u2019d renounce RPing for good (we had dark themes going on). Sent an apologetic message for the second time, and blocked him this time because I didn\u2019t want to expose myself to the anger that I was worried I was causing. This part occurred only over 2 days, about a week back. \n\nI feel like such a fool. Truly one of the nicest, most enjoyable, level headed people I\u2019ve ever met while doing RP\u2019s, and I just tossed him aside twice like he was nothing. I hate to imagine the hurt I might have caused by doing that, or the anger. I wish I could just apologise, but I won\u2019t go back a third time and cause even more distress.

We were gonna do a soulmate AU based on a fandom (Shadowhunters/Mortal Instruments if anyone cares) but with our own OCs.\n\nKey word: OUR OWN\n\nHowever, this person wanted me to basically make their OC. They wanted me to give them a name, species, background, family, occupation, the soulmate au type, nationality, sexuality, birthplace, etc.\n\nWhen I told them they had to make their own OC, you know what they said their contribution would be? \n\nThe appearance and the personality.\n\nThey eventually agreed to fill out their own info but by that point I just ghosted because I had a feeling I would be carrying the entire RP. I already had my own archived OCs that I could use, I wasn\u2019t about to make one from scratch just to hand off.\n\nThey also wanted me to play multi characters.\n\nIf anyone is like this? Don\u2019t be like this!",

If you\u2019re looking for a GM that\u2019s one thing but if you\u2019re lookin for just a normal rp, dumping all the work load on one person rather then evening it out seems almost lazy to me. Personally I think if you wanna do a 1 on 1 Rp with someone (and not a GM) you should both be playing secondary characters to help flesh out the world and have equal opportunities for different interactions to show off your character. \n\nHowever, having one sole person playing all the characters sounds tiring. \n\nAnyway this was just a mini vent from what I\u2019ve been noticing pop up lately.",

            "selftext": "I might make a series. We'll see. \n\nToday's story is partly inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qqwace/gay_men_and_misogyny/). Also, I responded to an ad about SWTOR RP, and while it's exciting, part of me hopes I don't run into any of the people involved in any of my Tales. (Filed under things that kept me from sleeping today: anxiety about running into Those People.) I don't even know how to flair this. Venting is definitely what it is, though.\n\nLong long ago, in Tumblr community far far away, I had an RP friend, we'll call them Alex. At the time of the story, Alex was still going by their AFAB name, married to a straight man, with kids, living in a rural town in the USA, and exploring gender-fluidity. Stuffed in the closet, basically, and peeking out. Last we spoke (this, also, years ago), Alex was divorced, undergoing hormone treatment, transitioning to male, living with his girlfriend, but still being/feeling feminine. TL;DR version, Alex is an efeminate bisexual trans-man.\n\nElsewhere in the community, was someone we'll name Ese. Ese was a gay man, but a misogynistic, transphobic one. Alex and Ese both tended to follow M/M pairings, especially porny/erotic ones, bonus points if there's character art. Alex had started RPing with a pair of very popular M/M RP writers (who did extensive character art, of the NSFW variety), so Alex's blog started getting reblogged by the more popular writers. Thus, Ese began to see Alex's content. \n\nAnd then shit began happening. (I suspect Ese was jealous that someone was getting RP that he wanted.) I had other people I followed, some of them LGBTQA, some of them porn addicts, people just kinda followed everyone else and you'd see the same reblog like, three billion times. So, I saw a reblog of Ese, like 3 billion times, vaguing about being \"tired of seeing white girls fetishizing gay men and writing them badly.\" Details were thrown in that anyone who knows Alex would be able to identify, so it's not exactly very vague. That passive-aggressive shade, tho. \n\nAlex was the kind of person that used RP to play-out their exploration of their sexuality. They'd RP a gay man as a way of trying it on. (The IC/OOC blurring was its own sin, and perhaps a Tale for another time. There's a reason we no longer talk!) They had an M/M RP going, with Alex' efeminate gay OC that was in a monogamous relationship with a more masculine gay OC. Angsty drama, suspicions of cheating, insecurity, jealousies, la dee da like that. \n\nA younger, more naive version of myself somehow got caught in the middle of Alex and Ese's nonsense. A la \"How dare you talk shit about my friend!\" I did manage to word it more civilly, but there's no way of calling out such nonsense without being somewhat aggressive in nature. (An older version of myself might have decided that there's no reasoning with fools, and being in the middle of crossfire just gets you fired upon.) Ese had his own ally, a straight (misogynistic and transphobic) man we'll call Kyle. Kyle was a very popular RPer, his writing was SO GOOD, according to many. So when Kyle jumped in, and everyone's seeing these things on their dashboard x4 (or 5 or 6, it became a whole dog-fight at one point), it sorta blew up.\n\nA little about Ese (as stated about himself and his beliefs during this debaucle):\n\n* He's a Real Gay Man\u2122, unlike those stereotypes\n* Real Men\u2122 are not monogamous.  \n* Monogamy is a thing invented by Straight Women\u2122. The only reason straight men are in monogamous relationships is because women trap them into them.\n* Real Gay Men\u2122 aren't restrained this way, so they are free to be as promiscuous as they want\n* Real Gay Man\u2122 are Manly Men, not girly boys. (Insert lament about how eVerYoNE stereotypes gay men as girly)\n* Real Men\u2122 don't display their emotions. \n* Jealousy is both an emotion that's displayed AND a reflection of monogamy, so Real Gay Men\u2122 would NEVAR do that\n* Straight Women are NOT ALLOWED to RP M/M because they write gay men like girls instead of REalIStiCallY\n\nOy.\n\nMeanwhile Kyle's position goes something like this:\n\n* Alex is a Straight Woman\u2122 pretending to be a trans-man in order to write fetishizing gay porn.\n* Real Men\u2122 aren't efeminate in any way. \n* Again, Real Men\u2122 don't display their emotions.\n* Alex's OC is obviously a Mary Sue self-insert (this is true enough)\n* The OC behaves like a straight woman, and is just a way for Alex to pose as a gay man to fetishize other gay men\n* And that's WRONG (or it would be, if true)\n* And policing *moral correctness* and *perfect RP etiquette* is the job of RP elitists like himself \n\nOy, pike off, would you guys?\n\nSo, many unfollows, blocks, and black-listings happened afterwards. The feeling's mutual, dudes. Good riddance, I'd say. And that should have been the end of it.\n\nNope.\n\nSo for years afterwards, Kyle would send friends of his to follow my blog and check up on me. And report anything/everything I post. They wouldn't follow me for my content, just to keep tabs. For YEARS afterwards, I'd get PMs or see a reblog or otherwise hear about them talking about me on their blog. And it was always characterizing me as homophobic, or a fetishizer. (Dude, I don't even care about M/M porn.) Or, you know, the random Anonymous comment in my inbox. Meanwhile, Alex torpedoed their blog, opened a new one, and made the RP partners swear secrecy about the new blog. (I can't imagine it was very secret for very long.)\n\nHere and there, new RP partners would approach me very cautiously, and eventually relate the Rumors they heard about me. *Oy, pike off, would you guys?* all over again. Oh! And \"Let's keep this RP in the PMs or on Discord or on Skype, I don't want it publicly known that I RP with you, because they'll unfriend me and drop RPs if they know I'm following and/or RPing with you.\" *Pike. The. Fuck. Off. Dudes.* \n\nOk, vent over. I hope you enjoyed this Tale.",

            "selftext": "So, about three-ish months ago. i joined a fairly new rp server, apocalypse themed. premise seemed amazing for me. and for a bit of context, well. i made a military oc since i'm planning to make a career out of it. hell, i'm applying for a military academy next year. i also know a lot of stuff, since i'm a budding historian at the side, particularly the history of warfare, weaponry. squad tactics. and how soldiers work in general, so i felt that i could play this one really good. The moderator had a a slight issue with my OC having many skills, but i explained that it would make sense, timeline wise, since the training of that specific organization worked this particular way. eventually i was accepted and everything was fine and dandy for the first few weeks.   \n\n\nUntil i fucked up? i still don't know. i still think it was unfair. so the server apparently works this way. you get 3? or was it 2? free passes for fucking up, and there was nothing in the rules that showed us a way to clear said infractions. and you straight up get banned, but in my opinion. the reason i got banned for is dumb? even though i admit the last infraction was kind of on me. was kind of dissapointed though, strict rules aside. it was one of my favorite servers.  \n\n\nSo here's how the story goes, how i got banned. so in the lore, there's this one thing about it that i always kind of forget about, being kind of forgetful in advance. it's a minor detail. but i tend to always either forget or type too fast. The lore in server says that the word \"Zombie\" doesn't exist. so people have been using word substitutes, like \"Infected\" or any other thing to call well, the walking dead. ghouls,walkers. whatever. i got my first infraction for saying zombies. i apologized, told them i'll try to not make it happen again. my infraction was still there but i figured with time it would be removed. things go fine for about a month and a half, but then. bonk, i fucked up again. so i apologized (more intensely this time) and they talked about how it was my \"final warning\" so i freaked. and had well, no infractions till then. and that was the part i kind of fucked up, it was my fault i admit. not thinking about people's reaction to my kind of humor. it was also kind of backstory related? but it was a very bad joke nonetheless. so my oc's backstory is that he was a german/latvian former counter-terror operator. went to the us to escape his past, and now worked as a security guard in a fancy security agency. i didn't clarify exactly in the backstory but i wrote hints of him being an immense patriot/devoted soldier, since he came from a long line of Prussian/WW2 germany era line of officers. so you would regularly see him hum something in the background \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\" or some other nationalist german song, as well as him having fond memories of his home. and now to my fuckup, if i remember right we were having a discussion on cars our characters would own, i jokingly sent a mangled WW2 era Kubelwagen with the swastika at the side. and jokingly said that was his ride of choice, or was it that Beetle with the Swastika? it was a poor joke i admit. all i got was \"Don't put swastikas in here please\" and i was like, \"my bad\" and then i got banned shortly, for my third infraction.   \n\n\nI kinda feel like it's my fault, what do you people think? i dunno, it might just be a reason to ban me because my character is in peak human condition minus the bum leg. i always get complaints about how my character knows everything too. even though i already explained how he'd learn said skills.",

            "selftext": "So first let me give a little background on this guy. \n\nHe\u2019s super nice, and I would consider him to a friend of mine. He gets along really well with everyone in the server and people seem to like him. I\u2019ve never had any problems with him. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve only done 3 scenes with him and I am currently in a 4th. I really like his character and am doing some shipping because our two characters\u2019 dynamic is really good. \n\nHowever, his writing style is starting to annoy me. At first, his writing was great. But now, holy shit can you say run on sentences? He used to have proper punctuation and all that jazz, and now it runs on for about 7 lines and it\u2019s so hard to read and it pisses me off. \n\nAs well as this, after a second scene, we decided that we would start shipping our characters \u2018K\u2019 and \u2018J\u2019. K (my character) is super reserved and has a hard time showing their emotions as they were always taught to keep it all in. J is a lot more outgoing but has little experience interacting with others. \n\nWe decided to it would be a slow burn ship, but now he\u2019s rushing it when we both agreed to take it slow. Which is really annoying because it feels way too forced and it\u2019s no longer true to my character or his. It\u2019s thrown it all off, and I don\u2019t even think he realises his doing it. \n\nThe third and final thing is that he wi throw in too much. I\u2019m all for a bit of tension and drama, but he will throw in like 5 things way in the one scene that doesn\u2019t feel natural and like he\u2019s just doing it just because? I don\u2019t even know, but it doesn\u2019t feel natural. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what what to do, because no one else seems to have a problem with it so I think it might just be me? I don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings because I do consider him a friend and I\u2019m just not sure how to bring it up with him. \n\nAny advice?",

            "selftext": "This happened a couple years ago, but I still think about it sometimes because it's literally funny to me. (first time actually posting my stories here, so forgive me if I've flaired this wrong LOL)  \nI met a girl who for anonimity purposes, I will call Alice. For a while, we were good friends. We chatted a lot and had decently active threads. But her writing was.... a bit of a mess. A total of MAYBE six periods in three-four paragraph posts, and a lot of what I'll assume was autocorrect? Generally mostly readable, but a lot of illegible chunks. A lot of details that I added got swept under the rug completely- if my character was in a certain situation or area, they were suddenly right next to Alice's character and helping her suddenly injured character.  \nEventually, the threads fell off and so did we, which was understandable. We closed off what wasn't working, and got started on hatching our next plot. I thought everything was going great, as she seemed to be enjoying what we were doing.  \nUntil I stopped hearing from her. Life happens, and I wasn't upset. I was just lost because daily messages turned into weekly ones, then she stopped responding altogether. Surely she would have told me if something was going on?  \nThen I'll admit, I fell off the bandwagon and just stopped logging on. I was prepared to explain when I returned, but she hadn't responded to what I'd sent about our next potential thread- and it had been months, but she'd been posting almost daily on her public page so I assumed she was still somewhat active.  \nI shot her a message, just asking if she was still interested in what we had going, only to get a very unenthusiastic 'ya' in return.   \nOkay, she's definitely not into this anymore. So I unfriended her, and cleaned out the rest of my friends list of folks that hadn't been active in months or people I didn't talk to.   \nThat was supposed to be that. Until one of my /old/ forum posts lit up like Christmas morning. \n\nAlice was suddenly interested again, and she was pissed.  \nThe gist of it was that I was personally slighting her for unadding her, said I'd never be a good person for what I'd done to her (which was basically nothing.) and said that I wasn't a good writer anyways. She sprinkled on a couple death threats for good measure, as you do in that situation. \n\nI explained to her that I waited for her, and she didn't seem interested when I finally asked her. And that should have been that. Eventually I just stopped reading what she was sending me and blocked her. Because that was supposed to be that.   \nNot even a day later, I recieve a friend request from an account less than an hour old. Kinda odd, but I accepted, figuring a newbie on the site was looking to meet some folks.  \nNope, just Alice again. She copy-pasted her original message, then unfriended me so I couldn't say anything. I just blocked her new account, and moved on. I thought it was over.  \nUntil a little '1' popped up in my Facebook message requests.\n\nIf you didn't guess, it was Alice. And she was somehow even more pissed, which I didn't even know was possible. She copy-pasted her original message, and added a little extra spice. And by extra spice, I mean threats on my life.  \nTL;DR don't unfriend inactive people on forum websites, because they will threaten your life LOL",

            "selftext": "Okay, what is with this? Why do you people get it in their peanut brains that they can control your character? Do you know how many times I've had people say that my oc reacted in a way or did something? Cam alone did it five billions times to everyone she's ever role played with. I don't understand it.\n\nI met one person who was trying to make an oc who could manipulate people but couldn't do it because my oc had a higher IQ than a Lima bean, so he took control of my oc to make it work. Other times I've had romantic relationships dumped on me and suddenly entire paragraphs BUTCHERING my oc's personality come out. And don't get me started on the one where a guy thought everyone's oc was a \"baby,\" so took control of them to make them act like stupid toddlers. \n\nIt's tiring to get people who can't wait for you to reply or talk to you, so they write your oc the way they want. And it's not just the one hit kills morons, as annoying as those are, it's anything when they start playing as your character without permission. Okay, I get it when you're writing a story and you can't role play every scene, but at least you got their permission and are sending them drafts for them to edit if they want to. But this is role play, you're sitting in a server and replying to each other, how hard is it to go a certain direction by asking if it's okay?\n\nI would not have minded if that one person wanted to do a manipulation storyline if they asked me, I would have switched to one of my dumber characters, but no. He had to take control and throw a fit when I wasn't okay with it. And god knows I can't stand it when someone one hit kills my ocs before they can even say \"hi.\" Thanks for that, Cam.",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo, about three-ish months ago. i joined a fairly new rp server, apocalypse themed. premise seemed amazing for me. and for a bit of context, well. i made a military oc since i'm planning to make a career out of it. hell, i'm applying for a military academy next year. i also know a lot of stuff, since i'm a budding historian at the side, particularly the history of warfare, weaponry. squad tactics. and how soldiers work in general, so i felt that i could play this one really good. The moderator had a a slight issue with my OC having many skills, but i explained that it would make sense, timeline wise, since the training of that specific organization worked this particular way. eventually i was accepted and everything was fine and dandy for the first few weeks.\n\nUntil i fucked up? i still don't know. i still think it was unfair. so the server apparently works this way. you get 3? or was it 2? free passes for fucking up, and there was nothing in the rules that showed us a way to clear said infractions. and you straight up get banned, but in my opinion. the reason i got banned for is dumb? even though i admit the last infraction was kind of on me. was kind of dissapointed though, strict rules aside. it was one of my favorite servers.\n\nSo here's how the story goes, how i got banned. so in the lore, there's this one thing about it that i always kind of forget about, being kind of forgetful in advance. it's a minor detail. but i tend to always either forget or type too fast. The lore in server says that the word \"Zombie\" doesn't exist. so people have been using word substitutes, like \"Infected\" or any other thing to call well, the walking dead. ghouls,walkers. whatever. i got my first infraction for saying zombies. i apologized, told them i'll try to not make it happen again. my infraction was still there but i figured with time it would be removed. things go fine for about a month and a half, but then. bonk, i fucked up again. so i apologized (more intensely this time) and they talked about how it was my \"final warning\" so i freaked. and had well, no infractions till then. and that was the part i kind of fucked up, it was my fault i admit. not thinking about people's reaction to my kind of humor. it was also kind of backstory related? but it was a very bad joke nonetheless. so my oc's backstory is that he was a german/latvian former counter-terror operator. went to the us to escape his past, and now worked as a security guard in a fancy security agency. i didn't clarify exactly in the backstory but i wrote hints of him being an immense patriot/devoted soldier, since he came from a long line of Prussian/WW2 germany era line of officers. so you would regularly see him hum something in the background \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\" or some other nationalist german song, as well as him having fond memories of his home. and now to my fuckup, if i remember right we were having a discussion on cars our characters would own, i jokingly sent a mangled WW2 era Kubelwagen with the swastika at the side. and jokingly said that was his ride of choice, or was it that Beetle with the Swastika? it was a poor joke i admit. all i got was \"Don't put swastikas in here please\" and i was like, \"my bad\" and then i got banned shortly, for my third infraction.\n\nI kinda feel like it's my fault, what do you people think? i dunno, it might just be a reason to ban me because my character is in peak human condition minus the bum leg. i always get complaints about how my character knows everything too. even though i already explained how he'd learn said skills. thing is my character may know a lot of stuff, though it's mostly improvisation.",

            "selftext": "Vent flair bc I'm not sure what is most appropriate. Bu at the end of the day, I think it's a vent. \n\nI've been in a situation currently where my mental health has been a bit low, courtesy of personal life happenstances. Like any hobby, I roleplay to distract and alleviate stress... But once roleplaying starts to *add* to the stress, it's just time for a break.\n\nRecently, I had a partner that we started kind of clashing OOC after awhile, having disagreements over the roleplay. I think we were both stressing each other out with it. They insinuated a few times that they might want a break from things: I told them if they needed a break, to take one and I wouldn't be offended if they did, but I ultimately always tried to 'solve' whatever problems were going on since they would never explicitly say with direct language that they wanted a break. It was always just an *insinuation.* Once they did straight up say \"I'm taking a hiatus\", it was then that I would accept that bluntly and say, \"Alright, take as long as you need.\" \n\nAfter a brief hiatus (just a day), we return to writing after talking it out. More clashing eventually ensues. And eventually, I'm the one who decides I want a break. I'm roleplaying to chill and have fun, and if I'm just stressed over it on top of life stress, then it's just not worth it. I don't tip toe. I don't like tip-toeing. So I say, \"I need to take a break.\" Very bluntly and to the point, because I don't like tip-toeing. \n\nMy partner does not take this well. They take it very personally, and very bluntly state, \"This feels like a personal 'fuck you'.\" I don't really know how to react to this. Whenever they wanted one (a hiatus), I was understanding, I thought. But they took it personally whenever I requested the same thing. I was upset (with myself) that they thought that way. I tried to instead make things work, which just led to a decrease in my mental health, and more disagreements and clashing ensued. Until we eventually worked it out again... Things continue again with the roleplaying, even though I feel like I'm walking on eggshells...\n\nBut it comes around, once again. *I need a break*. I'm really at a very low point, and the back and forth arguing just isn't helping: I make it very clear that I'm not doing well mentally and it's due to outside factors. And again, it's taken very personally. I'm told if life got in the way, it would be one thing, but me using mental health is just an excuse because I don't want to do the story how they want to, and so I'm just this that or the other. I can't remember all what was said, but... Ultimately, that ended things. My partner deleted all of the roleplays (I was the owner of the server, but they had admin status), and then they left the server.\n\nI was pretty distraught about it. More than I should be, in retrospect.   \nWhenever my partner insinuated they wanted a break (even though they did not state is black and white at first), I should have just said, \"Then take a break\", instead of trying to 'fix' the issues going on in the roleplay.\n\nAnd in turn, I've learned for the future: That if a partner wants to give you hell for wanting a break for *any* reason... Just go. I made the mistake of thinking because I thought this person was my friend, that I wanted to make it work instead of doing what I needed to do, but clearly they're not you're friend if they take you needing time away as a personal \"fuck you\". \n\nJust a vent/lessoned learned situation. This whole thing had me feeling lower than before, and honestly has soured my experience with roleplaying for a little while. Thankfully, I do have long term partners who are *super* understanding, so it's not like I'm out of the game forever but... It makes me weary from having *any* new partners in the near future.",

Our admin resigned and we, as a five people group, agreed to just manage things equally and keep going.\n\nA brought her character at the beginning, as planned, and me and J were meant to bring ours right away so they could join the main team at the same time but... J disappeared.\n\nFor weeks... they just didn't come.\n\nA's character started developing relationships with the characters that were already being played while mine and J's hadn't even started.\n\nWhen J finally appeared they only showed up once every few weeks, as we didn't have an admin no one told them anything about it so their character was underdeveloped, my character that came with theirs too because I was already way too invested on the other two characters I had and the villain cult ended up falling on me even though it was their idea and I had no idea where to go with that plot.\n\nEventually they disappeared for months and we just assumed they weren't coming back, their character was taken by the bad guys that were going for him and my character and A's developed relationships with the rest of the group (I'm still underinvested on that character) and I'm trying to find my way around getting the cult thing off my back.\n\nNow, J is coming back, one post every few months.\n\nThey don't do much, just kinda give signs of life of their character, but the problem is that they just don't let the plot die and they're neither working on fixing it, just leaving us hanging there on a plot we can't advance.\n\nAnd it's just pissing me off. Like, it's nice to see them but it's not nice to have a character involved with theirs anymore.",

            "selftext": "This was when I joined a RP about superheroes. My characters were Asher and Stella, villains in the story who were mid 30s and married. Yes, that is important.\n\nKitty joined about a day after me and Asher's profile was the one that clicked with her the most. She wanted her oc and Asher to date. The problem, besides that he's married, was that her oc was 14. I'm going to let that sink in. I said \"I'm sorry, but he's married and twice her age.\" And Kitty screamed and whined about not getting her way,  how I was so mean to her when she did nothing wrong, and reported me to the admin. Who looked at the conversation and went back to bed. \n\nThe next problem happened when Kitty logged on and saw the admin was speaking to someone. The admin posted a meme and the person used a bot to respond. Kitty got offended, somehow. She yelled at the bot (I guess she was new to discord) for interrupting the conversation. The person who used the bot tried to explain that it was BOT and not to worry about it. Kitty kept throwing a fit and the admin said that she also interrupted the conversation, so she was just as guilty as the bot. \n\nKitty lost it, screaming at the person, the bot, and the admin for attacking her \"for no reason.\" She cried and screamed about how mean everyone in server was and how she was the only nice person. I remember when she made a T chart of people who are \"good\" or \"evil\" just to get back at us. Of course, she was the only name on the \"good\" list.\n\nHer extreme reaction to not getting what she wanted got her in trouble with just about everyone. She finally got kicked off when someone threatened to report her if she didn't stop harassing them about how their oc wasn't to her standards, and she said \"I'm (age), you can't report me!\"\n\nShe was friend with one person still in the group and told him how everyone was rude to her \"for no reason\" and she never did anything to piss off anyone. She complained about how she was the only nice person in the group and everyone else was mean. When he told her that she harassed people for not giving her everything she wanted or making their oc the way she wanted, she yelled at him and blocked him.\n\nI only saw her again in another group where she tried again to get an oc twice the age of her oc to date her oc. I don't even know why she wanted to that so badly, but she did attack the person for feeling uncomfortable then cried that she was victim of bullying when they reported her.",

            "selftext": "\\[Not sure which flair this fits into, so I am putting it under venting for now. Also posting on a spare account I have, just so that no one can check my comment history or whatever.\\]\n\nI had such an experience today on one of the RP ad reddits.\n\nOn my RP 1x1 ad, I stated the following:\n\n*\"While I can do ERP, I am not interested in that becoming the sole purpose of the RP.\"*\n\nThe rest of the ad was just info for what plot ideas I had, info on me, what I was looking for in an RP partner. The basic stuff. The only reason I said the sentence above was because I was specifically looking for romance roleplays, but I wasn't interested in anything NSFW. I thought I made myself pretty clear, but one of the mods thought I was looking for NSFW.\n\nCue the comment conversation we had (everything is word for word, nothing changed):\n\n**Mod:** If interested in nsfw content, you must mark your post as such\n\n**Me:** I'm not looking for NSFW though :/ I will note for the future tho!\n\n**Mod:** 'While I can do ERP, it should not be the sole focus.' That is why the nsfw tag is needed\n\n**Me:** I think you misinterpreted my comment, I meant to say it so people understand I'm capable of it, but I am NOT looking for a ERP based RP. I'll clarify better next time I make a post like this.\n\n*\\[that was my original comment, then I added an edit a couple of seconds later, which is the following\\]*\n\nedit: I should add that adding my post to NSFW defeats how I am not looking for NSFW, if that makes sense.\n\n**Mod:** I didn't misinterpret anything. You say that you can do it and that it shouldn't be the sole purpose. That's not anything close to a 'I don't do ERP and don't want this to be an ERP'\n\n**Me:** Clearly you're not getting my message though. Hence why I'm clarifying and will clarify in the future! I'm sure you can understand my point about not wanting to add the NSFW flair when I'm making a point right now to say it's not what I'm looking for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mod didn't respond after that, and later on I found out my post was removed. Turns out they also must've had some friends upvote their comments and downvote mine. Not a big deal but damn, all that when I just want to clarify something?\n\nTo be fair, I can understand how my original sentence in my post must've been unclear, but I was being pretty damn clear in the comments. I don't think I should have had my post removed for that, but I wanted to hear some thoughts. \n\nDid it make sense to have my post removed? Am I being unreasonable?",

            "selftext": "Few days ago I posted about a new RP that I started off with an old RP partner. I deleted the post again because on second thought I felt like I was maybe being a little petty. Now I realize that I should've listened to my gut feeling that something is off.\n\nBtw english isn't my first language &amp; also not the language I RP in, so my apologies if I make typos or don't use the correct terms.\n\nSo I played with a long term RP partner on again off again for several years. We had a break for few months &amp; wanted to start playing again. I suggested that we could do some sort of action RP with our both OCs which we used multiple times before. Our OCs are mercenaries but the last plot we had didn't have any action in it, therefore I wanted to switch things up, since our action RPs were fun. At least fun to a degree. In my opinion they were a little too easy. Our characters won the fights without getting injured or caught. I said I'd like to change that, give them some kind of challenge this time to make it feel..less God-Like.\n\nSo I came up with a draft for our plot &amp; my partner said ''hey let's make it that their friend gets kidnapped by a gang &amp; our OCs have to rescue her''. That ''friend'' is a side character I created some while ago for a scene, just like he created another ''friend'' for that scene. He wanted us to play two characters each for this plot because his friend OC liked my friend OC. He said it'll be fun to mix things up a little by bringing them along for a little while. Tbh I wasn't a huge fan of the idea itself because I'm not a fan of playing multiple characters at once for a longer plot, but I agreed because it was said that'll be just a few scenes &amp; we'll mainly play our actual OCs, not their friends.\n\nSo we start playing for a few days, are half way through the plot &amp; out of nowhere my partner tells me OOC ''You know what? I'd love to ship the second OCs &amp; play as them''.. I gently let my partner know that I am really not interested in playing as that character which I created briefly for a single scene from the past. And that I am not planning on starting a complete new RP with this partner, when our current RP isn't even finished yet. \n\nSuddenly he tells me that he wanted to bring along those side characters into the plot because he was hoping that we'd start to play them as main characters &amp; if I'm not interested in playing those characters, then we should come up with a whole new plot because he doesn't wanna play this one anymore, since it wouldn't make sense if I don't agree to jumping on those characters. I asked my partner if he doesn't think that he should've been open with me about his thought process from the beginning instead of bombarding me with an idea like this in the middle of our play. According to him he was being very open about it &amp; that ***I*** was the one who wanted to change things up. Well yes, I wanted to stop this God-Mode bullshit, I didn't say I want to start a complete new RP with (new) characters that are anything but fleshed out. \n\nMy partner then tried to convince me that I'd have fun playing as that character (which is not true) &amp; that I should give it a go. When I stood my ground he basically let me know that he wouldn't have ''agreed'' to this plot if he knew that I am not willing to do as he wishes &amp; that he doesn't want to continue our plot but rather just dump it entirely. &amp; now it's on me to come up with another new plot. Nice, isn't it?",

This one introduction is well written, friendly sounding, and they even offered a little writing example! \nSo you chat with this person for a while and you hit it off as both acquaintances and partners. You have a lovely plot going and then radio silence for a while. Your partner is going through a rough spot, completely understandable. \nThe next time you go to check in on them the server they made for you has been deleted and you have been blocked with no warning. That\u2019s what just happened, or at least I found out I was blocked today because I don\u2019t want to pester a potentially grieving partner. I don\u2019t know if I did something wrong or if my responses weren\u2019t interesting enough to hold their attention long enough. I\u2019ve gotten radio silence from so many great partners at this point, but this one hit the hardest because I genuinely thought we were friends.",

            "selftext": "This may not even be universal at all, perhaps I'm just wierd- but having a fixation on a specific character, or idea, is sometimes SO God awful. \n\nFor a little context I guess, I'm autistic so when I do get fixated on things, it's usually taken to the extreme, and it's rarely comfortable. So having an idea or roleplay you really really want to do, only for it to not get any traffic at all, or the partners you do end up meeting doesn't really end up lasting long term, it sucks. \n\nEspecially now- cause i did actually get some people interested, however It more or so ended up working well with one people.. which seems to be losing interest.\nI feel like I can't repost the ad constantly cause ill both be annoying to the two subreddits I post in- and I feel bad. Like a small guilt towards either my current partner(s) or the ones that it didn't work out with, if that makes sense. \n\nSo now I'm kinda stuck- I have this itch for an idea that I really really want to do, but I'm kinda lost as to how. I don't know how to get more people interested in my prompt, or what I'm doing wrong for some of them to stop being interested half way throught. \n\nThat's it, somewhat of a petty rant and not particularly a story about a bad RPer, but it's still bothersome so I figured I'd get it off my chest.
