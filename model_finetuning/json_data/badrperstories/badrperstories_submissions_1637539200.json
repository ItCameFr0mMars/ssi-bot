This one guy contacted me for an rp, and said he was 37, and looking to play a 19 year old super-hero character. The faceclaim he gave me was very basic from an anime, the character had glowing eyes, had blood stains on his face, and just gave me those kinda 'I'm special look at me vibes'. Like when someone sends a character whose missing an eye, has brightly colored hair, and the one eye they do have is neon red or something- you know what I mean? Anyway, between all this and the fact that they were very stiff ooc (writing things like 'I am well. No thank you. Yes, as responses) made me tell them I wasn't interested.  \n\n\nSome of my characters are a bit eccentric, and I know that not everyone uses emojis or exaggerated speech ooc, but I was getting weird vibes. Especially because he's playing a 19 year old at 37? I dunno, seems...eh? Am I crazy? Now he seems upset with me though, and I'm no longer responding. I don't want to be mean, but there were too many red flags.",

            "selftext": "So since a couple of years ago, I\u2019ve strayed away from signing up to any fandom role play sites, because fandoms like My Hero Academia, will just produce secret villains attending U.A. and other bad role play incidents. Which leads me to only rping in games like FFXIV. Went to a friend\u2019s venue, a bar, and met two people there, although only one of them kept emoting.\n\nThings were going fine, until she started trying to argue about light vs darkness with me. I\u2019ve always written as a neutral character, reasonably working for the winning side, while benefitting myself, sticking with the repercussions if it winds up being the wrong decision. Every political speech the villains gave in FFXIV, have been *so* easy to counter. When it comes to politics in these situations, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to just favor one side, but to prove your ideals are right.\n\nWell, this girl kept close-mindedly going on about how good the light was, so I brought up primordial light, since not all of us are Warriors of Light, in our own lore. Primordial light turned people into monstrosities. She still kept being insistent the light was good, and this wasn\u2019t even a whole cult aspect of her. It was just an insane belief in good, when I\u2019ve rped with someone who played a blind character, and people were always passing her by, never taking to her.\n\nHow can you argue that good is absolute, when in my lore, I\u2019ve seen people ignore someone sitting on the ground with a blindfold on? Never talking to her, and making plans to see her again, but also not committing to that? I stopped trying to argue with her, after a guy had stepped in, and listening in to her rping, I learn a couple of things. She\u2019s a mother of some children, and doesn\u2019t like seeing others get hurt. But she was a Dark Knight (But in her Paladin class at the time), a class of people who thrives on anger/the pain of others, for their power source.\n\nAfter I got up prepared to leave, she absentmindedly started talking about how much she hated how Dragoons jumped into battle, considering them idiots for doing so, not knowing that the owner of that venue was a Dragoon main. Here\u2019s the problem with this. She is *so* weak-willed, being unable to stomach seeing others get hurt, but has the nerve to call people willing to leap into battle as idiots, when the Dragoons are the core of the army. Ontop of her being too close-minded to see the world isn\u2019t all good, I winded up fully believing she\u2019d prefer Vaughtry\u2019s false paradise, because no one could possibly be this dumb. Should humanity just keel over and die, just because she hates that people fight for themselves? How dare she try and assert that what they\u2019re doing is wrong? Who even asked her to go into the army to fight, when artisans and crafters exist? I really just hated everything about her lore, because this is the exact thing the Ascians would mock.",

            "selftext": "There was another post on here that reminded me of these 3 players who I was in a server with years ago.   \nPlayer A adopted a character with a fixed PB, whose eyes were canonically brown. Apparently brown wasn't pretty enough for her, so she would say *once per paragraph* something about her \"green-flecked-gold eyes.\" Verbatim, every time. Once per paragraph is not an exaggeration.   \nWe had a channel for writing tips, and someone posted an infographic about different eye colours and different ways to describe them, *purely* because the entire server was so sick of their characters being looked at by *green-flecked-gold eyed.*  \n\n\nPlayer B came into the story and before she'd even applied, she had her sights set on a guy whose PB had heterochromia. So she made her character have heterochromia too, using a PB that at that time was going through a pretty big social media scandal because it had turned out she'd been faking the condition and claiming she was bullied for it, for clout. Just a PB, not a big deal maybe.   \nBut *once per* ***sentence***, she would include \"her bi-colored eyes.\" As if we all needed the constant reminder that the character had one blue eye and one brown eye.   \nIt just felt like all her posts translated to \"by the way, my character has uniquely pretty eyes. Compliment her eyes, guys. Aren't her eyes pretty? TELL ME HER EYES ARE PRETTY OR I WILL CRY!!!\"  \n\n\nPlayer C is more of a bonus for this post. She changed her PB for the same character about 4 times in a year because she wanted people to want her character so badly. It didn't occur to her that the reason no one wanted their characters to obsess over hers was that she was constantly trying to loop them all into love triangles no one consented to or that she would get excessively possessive over her writing partners if they played with someone else, to the point of dropping herself into every scene her partner's put their characters into - whether she was invited or not.   \n\n\nBut honestly, the reason Player C is being included in this is that she, like the other two, found a word or phrase that she liked and she used it into the ground. Player C's word was \"demure.\"  \nNow, for those who don't know, \"demure\" is an adjective which means \" reserved, modest, and shy (typically used of a woman).\" It can also apply to modest clothing.   \n\n\nPlayer C used \"demure\" as a verb, once per post. She *demured.*   \n*Demuring softly, she blushed and straightened, still not looking the Lord in his eyes.*  \n\n\nDrove me nuts lol. Honestly, I don't have hate for any of these women. We made a drinking game out of their frequent, over-uses of their catchphrases, and it ended up being a lot of fun.

            "selftext": "Okay, so I met this dude on a website. So he started out okay, I didn't really see any problems until a few weeks until his friendship...parts of his ugly potential personality disorder decides to show.\n\nI'm an introvert, I find talking to people really exhausting right? I'm sure some of you can relate. I only have lots of time for people who I am very close to like my really really really close discord friends. I don't feel tired after talking to them, quite the opposite in fact I feel energized. \n\n...He ain't one of those people.\n\nI've spoken to him a few times not to get in my face so much because that's a boundary of mine. It's a shortcut to getting on my bad side. He doesn't care. He thinks he's entitled to my attention and I'm pissed off with his childish, toddler-esque \"mine\"-phase. 'Everything relating to me is IMPORTANT'-mindset, so to speak.\n\nHe decides to be really condescending about how I decide to choose my partners. I am very particular about how I choose my partners and I'm not interested in playing with him. He's tried to bring up roleplaying with him many many times before - I just wasn't interested. I didn't find his writing to have any personality or any 'soul'. His prose was quite bland.\n\nI feel like he doesn't really care about my feelings on the matter, he just wants to RP and get his rocks off. So I tell him that I'm done with him and remove him from discord. I'm fed up with his constant need for attention and trying to force me into doing roleplaying with him. Enough's enough. The guy was quite creepy and he would often approach me about how I'm looking for RP on different characters...or he knows I'm online when I'm set to invisible on discord.\n\nHe just ignored these boundaries, DND, Invisible, he didn't care. What mattered was that he wanted attention and I was his narcissistic supply.\n\nI removed him from discord...but it wasn't over. He decides to PM me on my roleplay site. He's barely known me for a few months and he was like \"I'll miss yooooouuuu\". Motherfucker, didn't know me enough to miss me. He thought the relationship was deeper than what it was. His message made my fucking skin crawl. I thought that was the end of it after I archived the message and left it at that.\n\nBUT WAIT! There's more!\n\nHe fucking googled my character name and found a username to a deactivated art account that I deactivated because that art website had a lot of drama surrounding the website and messaged me there. I logged on by pure chance because I was looking to get some art for my character? What do I see?! His username begging for my forgiveness for wronging me.\n\nNo. Just no. He's stalking me now and I'm just really uncomfortable now. What does he do? He does this **THREE. MORE. TIMES.** He won't leave me alone. He's telling me he's crying, he's going to do X, he's going to do Y. He doesn't actually list what he's actually did wrong, He actually doesn't know what he did wrong. He lacks any self-awareness\n\nSo just to recap, he's stalked me, he's disrespected my boundaries by incessantly trying to talk to me and he's made 6 or so sock puppets to stalk me again on another website. The guy's not right in the head folks.\n\nIn his last and final account, he gives me 10 paragraphs which reads like someone with a split personality abusing me and praising me at the same time. Mind you, it didn't take him very long to start abusing me after behaving in a really creepy and disrespectful way.  He brings up abuse from my narcissistic parents and using what he's read from my Reddit posts on RBN and tells me I'm like parents and I'm supposedly dead inside then says he is done with me, mirroring what I said to him. He threatens me harm in the bio section of the website.\n\nBut what really got me was that he was saying I was stupid because I was using a word in Afrikaans, because my command of language is fluent and I wanted to make a South African character. He insulted me for thinking I meant \"Tasty\" in German when I meant \"Good\" in Afrikaans since it basically means anything \"Excellent\" or \"Good\" because it's a very mangled form of Dutch -NOT German.\n\nHe then threatened to steal my \"Retarded\" hybrid character to steal the attention I supposedly want out of spite. When this guy doesn't understand that I don't want any attention because I find talking to people I barely know quite draining. Why would anyone copy something they think is retarded? HE'S MORE THAN WELCOME TO DO SO. I don't *own* that particular hybrid, yet he thinks I do? The fuck?\n\nHe failed to understand I made a character that particular hybrid because it reflects my actual heritage as a kind of joke. Asian Animal + European animal, because I'm half-asian. I wasn't doing it to be edgy, I just thought it would be interesting. His lore was that one of his parents was an Eldritch being and it would be hilarious for his mother to create a child that was nothing like her.\n\nAnd after all that, he says he wants nothing to do with me, made light of my trauma at the hands of my mother and projected his mental illness onto me while threatening to bash my face in and has tried to add me any chance he gets after abusing me and claiming he was done with me.\n\nNo words. Words have failed me. He's a special kind of stupid if he thinks I'm going to have anything to do with him after all of what has transpired. I'm not a psychologist, but I'm certain he might be a narcissist because he has that belief that his actions don't have consequences and assumes I'll just forget what he's done.\n\nPure cancer.",

This one takes the cake. \n\nI run a private roleplay server that's one on one that has all my roleplayers be on a private section with me and only I can see these sections, they can only see our roleplay. Lately I haven't had a lot of roleplays going on, so I decided to purge a lot of roleplayers who did not answer and ghosted practically. A lot answered back positively but this Dillweed, (We are gonna call him Dillweed cause he's a Dillweed.) I sent Dillweed a nice message that said.... \n\n\"Hi (Dillweed,) I'm gonna give you a day to respond to this message. I am kicking people ghosting but I haven't heard from you and have seen you posting.\"\n\nThen I texted him and now you guys saw he was a complete and utter butthead. He acted like a Karen practically and so well I let off as I had a rough day and I was the bigger person in this. Sure you never wish Karma upon someone but for him to go off like that (Oh and as I'm writing this he's writing a long response to me but I blocked him LMAO) and for him to act like a tough noodle is not okay.\n\nI've just been having a rough day overall and with my roleplayers all dropping, I just needed to express and see if I was in the wrong. I mean I kept trying to get updates, I updated him and I even gave him like four days instead of one as I got busy but still nothing.\n\nLet me know y'all, I wish no one to have a experience like I did.",

            "selftext": "So I have had this weird roleplay experience... It didn't faze me, but I thought it was worth sharing.  \n\n\nAs starters, I would like to mention that I absolutely love planning the chronological order of the roleplay, brainstorming new ideas, whipping up some ideas for character development, and whatnot!  \n\n\nThis roleplay partner of mine was not familiar with OOC planning. I understand, not a lot of people commit to the roleplay to the point where there is a fully-fledged OOC discussion. No problem, they were fine with talking it out with me.  \n\n\nBut as I was throwing out some prompts, the only thing I could understand was that they were nitpicking on it instead of collaborating with me.   \n\n\n\"Oh, that doesn't make sense.\"  \n\"Why did your OC do this?\"  \n\"Do we really need to include that in the roleplay?\"  \n\n\nI was like OK, it's fine if you are not happy with the idea. But let's recycle it onto something else TOGETHER to make both of us happy. OR we can discard the idea completely and come up with something else TOGETHER.   \n\n\n\"But you are an author, you should know how to do this.\"  \n\n\nYes, being an actual author and publishing a book required me to think about ideas by myself, because it's solo writing. But roleplaying is collaborative writing...   \n\n\nIt's always been my pet peeve in roleplay. I do not like when there is a non-proportional ratio of planning in the roleplay. I do not want all the roleplay ideas, character development, and all that to be pinned down on me! Or vice versa!",

I explained to him that I was at Disney for the day and wouldn\u2019t be able to be very present and for a little bit I was super responsive because I was sitting down having a snack and waiting for my lightning lane time slot. \n\nTime slot came, I put my phone away and enjoyed my time but checked my phone when I had a few minutes. I noticed he would do a whole lot of like \u201cyou there?\u201d Or \u201cso what do you think?\u201d And I don\u2019t like that. \n\nThe dealbreaker for me was when he sent a message, I read it and maybe thirty minutes later he had deleted the message and resent it worded very slightly different. Ended everything right there. It felt like attention seeking manipulation and I don\u2019t like that. \n\nOther deal breakers: \n\n- Referring to your character as yourself or writing in first person. Like if we\u2019re talking plot and you\u2019re like \u201cI will come in and fight the bad guy\u201d because to me it sounds like you aren\u2019t able to separate  RP from real world. If the plot and writer are good I *can* tolerate first person as long as it\u2019s not a romance plot and you\u2019re very clear about the fact that you are not your character. \n\n- A focus on length over content \n\n- Writing an \u2018est\u2019 character. Smartest, best, youngest at something etc because 9/10 it\u2019s just lazy writing. \n\n- Not contributing anything to the plotting stage. I want to collaborate and create something together, if I wanted no input I\u2019d write fan fiction. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of more but I wanna hear yours.",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been commenting in this subreddit a lot, and I realize that I\u2019ve never had an actual post talking about my horror stories. Let\u2019s fix that!\n\nFor context, the RP\u2019s setting was one basically inspired by [*Battle Royale*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)). A group of high school students is abducted and thrown into a death game. It didn\u2019t take place literally in the setting, but it definitely took inspiration. It also took place primarily on a forum.\n\nOne person on the forum was someone I\u2019ll refer to as Bob. Bob\u2019s thing\u2026 is that he\u2019s kind of what you\u2019d typically refer to as an edgelord. There are some other horror stories about him that I do have, stuff like me saying to his face \u2018hey, maybe don\u2019t pull in a bunch of muns into a Skype call to do a dramatic reading of a thread, then openly post the audio? Even if the thread itself has issues, it\u2019s still a dick move\u2019 and, unfortunately, stuff in RP that can be summed up as \u2018edgy for the sake of edgy\u2019 and \u2018at least three depictions of outright hate crime-related stuff purely for the aforementioned edginess.\u2019 He also had a history of, basically, being super confrontational and caustic, to the point where he\u2019d end up in fights with multiple people and end up polarizing as a person, despite, well\u2026\n\nBob was in the worst possible position you could put someone like him in a group RP. See, Bob was a moderator. He did not start the RP site, he was promoted from a regular member. And as time went on, Bob became just as notorious a mod as you could imagine. I admittedly started off friendly with Bob, but as he became more openly vitriolic and 2edgy4me, I started to cut off ties with him, to the point where, by the time this story starts, I had him blocked on Discord and would refuse to interact with him under any circumstances, let alone RP with him. I still roleplayed on the forum, but I mostly stuck to side chats and was more picky-choosy about who I threaded with. There are, again, a lot of things I could share about Bob, but this one, in particular, is more an example of Bob being funny for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAt one point, he created what he referred to as a \u2018parody character\u2019. Let\u2019s call this character Jason. Jason was, essentially, your mall ninja type. You know, the kind of dudebro who was super into martial arts and weaponry, but only the flashy stuff. Jason, however, notably sucked at what he was interested in and was overconfident about his skill level. Bob was actually someone who had done pro-wrestling with a local group before, plus did some other fighting-related things, so you\u2019d think the parody would focus on playing around with ridiculous fight scene tropes in RP, right? It was, to his credit, something that could have been legitimately funny and had a lot of potential, especially with his apparent IRL knowledge.\n\nIn practice, though? Jason was mostly used to poke fun at earlier scenes in the RP, or sometimes even other muns. Very little of it was actually fight scene related. A lot of the humor essentially ended up \u2018let\u2019s make meanspirited jokes about other RPers and their characters!\u2019 Some of this was stuff from years ago where the people involved were no longer involved with the site, and thus were less likely to come across it. Other times, though, it poked fun at stuff that was very recent.\n\nAn infamous example was when a new member had a post that was bad in that \u2018failed OTT humor\u2019 way (the mun in question later looked back on that post and went \u2018yeah, I see how that had issues and I cringe whenever I read it\u2019). Bob literally copypasted the post in question, changed the wording around to make it more \u2018funny\u2019, and reposted it as Jason as a dream sequence solo thread. When he was called out on the newb himself for \u2018plagiarism\u2019, Bob\u2019s response was apparently just \u2018noooooooooo I\u2019m making fun of you. ;)\u2019\n\nSo, context, and a general understanding of lack of professionalism from Bob, particularly when Jason was involved, clear? Good? Let\u2019s get on to the meatier, more personal stuff.\n\nAt one point, when the game was underway, Jason had a run-in with a rival. Note that by this point, Jason had actually killed someone in an argument, yet was still doing the whole \u2018whee parody and IC shade thing\u2019 despite this (in case you\u2019re wondering: yes, there was IC shade in the death scene in question too. And also random quoting of Pulp Fiction for whatever reason?). The rival confronted him over this previous death, and then Jason took off running, exiting the thread.\n\nMeanwhile, while that was going on, I was in a thread that took place in an area that was relatively close by ICly. It took place prior to the previous announcement cycle, which, in this RP, was 24 hours. The reason why was because, admittedly, my thread mates and I were being slow for a variety of reasons. In it, my character (let\u2019s call her Ellie) and the group she was in were having a huge argument because it turned out an antagonist had tricked them earlier. It wasn\u2019t helped by another character deciding to leave in the night, nor of Ellie losing not just friends, but literal family to the game. Naturally, tensions were high, and the scene was supposed to end with the group splitting for good. Because I was busy studying IRL and I was roleplaying another character of mine\u2019s death scene, this time a villain, I quickly shot out a post so Ellie wasn\u2019t being neglected. Afterward, the night this happened was reasonably quiet for some time. I remember looking up from some things I was practicing on paper to occasionally refreshing the main page to see if I needed to respond to my villain\u2019s death thread until I noticed that the thread I had just posted in, the one Ellie was, had gotten a fresh post.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t from anyone already in the thread. It was from Bob.\n\nAgain, by this point, I wasn\u2019t on good terms with Bob and was actively avoiding him, so I took a deep breath and looked at it, hoping that whatever this was, I can manage it.\n\nBob\u2019s post consisted of:\n\n* Jason running away immediately after the thread he came from as if he was being chased by the aforementioned rival.\n* Screaming in terror at a dead body the group had moved outside earlier\n* Then running out of the thread in the same post, without interacting with anyone in the thread who happened to be inside a building. No, he didn't acknowledge anyone was in the thread in the post.\n* All of this in that wacky \u2018laugh, dang you!\u2019 tone that Jason was known for.\n\nI stared at it for, by my guess, around 20 minutes. My initial reaction was just a simple, confused \u2018uh, thanks for that?\u2019. Then, as I processed what I was looking at a bit more, confusion turned to frustration.\n\nSee, Bob committed two major faux pas here. The first is immediately obvious: having what\u2019s essentially a joke character interrupt an ongoing scene, especially one on the dramatic side, and without asking the people in the scene to begin with, is generally a bad idea. The other? You might recall that, because of slowness, we were actually still on the previous announcement cycle. However, Jason\u2019s last thread was on the current.\n\nOr, to put it another way, Jason was now a time-traveling demon.\n\nAfter some time just rubbing my temples with both hands and trying to take deep breaths, I opened up a side chat on Skype that was originally used for planning but then became a general, smaller group chat for casual conversation. I wrote something to the effect of \u2018Guys, I hate to do this, but I need to vent. Jason\u2019s latest post really irritates me.\u2019\n\nThis, of course, alerted everyone in said chat who was online to the time crimes when I vented about the situation. Since I didn\u2019t feel comfortable alerting Bob of his faux pas personally because of our past beef, someone kindly offered to tell him personally that, hey, Jason time-traveled into that thread. I agreed, and they did so, pinging him in the site\u2019s main chat on the then-new Discord.\n\nBob\u2019s response became notorious pretty quickly. It was something along the lines of \u2018oh oops. I guess he ran so fast he time-traveled! I\u2019m not gonna fix it, lol.\u2019\n\nNaturally, as the person who told him relayed the bad news to the smaller Skype chat, that meant that everyone still in the thread had to figure out how to work around Jason\u2019s time-based sorcery in a setting where you\u2019d think that wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I remember messaging the people in the thread asking if it was possible to ignore it, while sympathetic people in the Skype chat were offering advice on how to deal with the situation now that we know Bob was digging his heels and refusing to delete or otherwise fix the post.\n\nAt one point, someone said \u2018okay, it\u2019s actually kinda funny now that he\u2019s doing it in other threads.\u2019\n\nI look. Yup! He is doing the same \u2018in-and-out screaming\u2019 thing in other threads. No time travel this time, but still, essentially the \u2018wacky joke character runs in, interrupts an ongoing scene with wacky screaming, then leaves\u2019 deal. He did this to a total of three threads. Apparently, he didn\u2019t message these people either, because the next day, as more people were online to see it, they responded with similar amounts of confusion in the Skype chat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat is Jason doing? Why is he just running in and out of threads?\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently he time-traveled into one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shit, someone tell Bob?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows, but he\u2019s refusing to fix it because Jason ran so fast he time-traveled or something.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, other staff got involved. Let\u2019s call the main one Kitty.\n\nKitty eventually straight up told Bob that he was being selfish and causing problems because of his refusal to fix something that was fairly easy. The main thing that people, including her, told him is that he could have made the post that time-traveled a solo thread. All he needed to do was to copy it, delete the post, then repost it as a thread. As Bob was a mod, this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue, and solo threads were completely allowed.\n\nBob, of course, threw a tantrum. Apparently, it was *entirely* our fault Jason time-traveled because we didn\u2019t put the day in the thread\u2019s subtitle, despite the fact that there was not (nor was there ever) a rule like this, and he could have figured it out from a close read of the thread before posting, or, you know, by asking. Like he should have done anyway. And he, for whatever reason, acted like it was against his vision to have part of Jason\u2019s scream-a-thon be in a solo thread, and thus we\u2019re all terrible and awful. Kitty wasn\u2019t having any of this and kept telling him off.\n\nEventually, after a few days of arguing, Bob relented. He deleted the time crime, and reposted the original in and out as a solo. But not, of course, making his saltiness clear. The thread was titled something like \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Jason is not a Time-Lord\u2019, and his in-out tags were stuff like \u2018Jason continued in a thread I was forced to make\u2019 and \u2018Jason continued from Timey Wimey Fuckery\u2019.\n\nAnd that was that! We continued the scene as planned, Jason continued being Jason, and Bob was still an edgelord. It\u2019s still something I joke a lot about to this day, as it\u2019s the sort of thing that was frustrating at the time, but hilarious looking back.\n\nSo, what lessons have we learned here?\n\n* If you have a parody character that consists of you throwing shade, don\u2019t do things that would be the sort of thing you\u2019d personally poke fun at.\n* In fact, make an actually funny parody character.\n* Please read through scenes entirely before you post, even if it\u2019s a quick in-out. Otherwise, you might make a pretty huge noticeable mistake.\n* If someone politely corrects you on an error, don\u2019t throw a tantrum when everyone recommends you fix it, especially since it\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s easily corrected.\n\nTLDR: someone-- a mod, at that-- created a character that mostly consisted of him throwing OOC shade ICly, time traveled because he didn't bother to actually read a scene, then threw a temper tantrum when told off.",

I have yet to get any responses back because I sent it just now, but I\u2019m wondering if that could teach him to communicate better. I did recall during the RP when I asked if he could write at least 1-2 paragraphs because I don\u2019t do one-liners and he seemed unsure, so this is what may possibly have made him bounce?

            "selftext": "Too often, it seems like metrics of how many words you write or your level of \"literacy\" determines the way your skill as a role player gets measured.\n\nHere are some things that if an ideal writer would do. And I've written with some excellent writers who don't do them.\n\n1. Offers feedback. Maybe it's my need for reassurance, but I don't know if you are enjoying the roleplay, my writing, or if I messed and need to change something unless you say so. It's not a sin to say you enjoyed a post or liked someone else's writing. It's more exciting when both people are excited about writing and show it. In the same measure, throw some negative feedback if it's balanced with genuine compliments.\n\n2. Respects OOC boundaries. You don't have to share every detail of your life with a writing partner even if you write for years. While it's nice to establish an OOC repertoire, it's not needed outside of the discussion about the ongoing scene.\n\n3. Plays interesting characters. Not every character needs to be the belle of the ball or have a complex and traumatic past, but at least in their mannerisms and the way they play should be interesting.\n\n4. Doesn't gloss over important details or miss reply points. It's incredibly annoying when you give reply points for simple responses in the RP and the other person doesn't respond to them.\n\n5. Is active in dialogue in action. Their characters respond not only to questions but create new paths for dialogue to go down. A partner who knows how to push the scene forward while not glossing over anything in their reply is amazing. Passive responses start as a minor irritant if they happen once and can kill the RP if they continue.\n\n6. Returns effort (Most of the time). So while it's not workable that post lengths and the time spent on the post will always be equal, it's obvious that some are like \"I'm writing this much and I'm done.\" Consistently allowing the other writer to put more effort into their post is a no from my dog. It's irritating if it happens once and can kill motivation for the RP completely if it seems too one-sided consistently. \n\n7. A \"Yes And?\" mentality. They come with their own ideas and are receptive to your own, even if tweaks need to be made to yours or their ideas. Incredible pickiness is the death of many brainstorming sessions, as is having nothing to contribute.\n\n8. No passive-aggressiveness, manipulative tactics or entitlement like you should be grateful they are writing to you. I understand this hobby comes with a lot of egos, but at the least, you appear picky or annoying and, at the worst, you appear pretentious and arrogant.",

So he tells me the name for his character \n\n*Astro*\n\nAnd he sends me a paint drawing that looked like it was done by a 5 year old. Not to judge anyone's artistic expression but it looked like a triangle with a square for the head. It reminded me of what my 6 year old nephew draws when he tries to draw a \"superhero\". He goes on to explain that this was his Ben 10 OC, and he insisted on playing him. This wasn't a Ben 10 rp. I don't know why he thought that would fit, or be appropriate. Anyway, I take pride in not ghosting people unless they give me a really good reason to, so I soldier on. I write the introduction, describe the restaurant, him walking in and seeing me, my character and what I'm wearing. His response?\n\n*Sits down at the table* \"I'm Astro\" \n\nI laughed out loud when I got that text, I kept going a few more texts, but the fact that he only sent one liners, and that name made me not able to take anything seriously.

I was still new to the RP community, and I was open to far more than I am now that I\u2019ve discovered many new preferences and limits, so I said sure. We talked about fandoms and agreed on Pokemon, deciding to do a SOL story about a family of Pokemon trainers.\n\nFrom there, we assigned our characters. I was to play the parents (lesbian mothers) and he wanted to play their two kids. Not entirely my bag, as I\u2019d have preferred to play one parent and one child, but he insisted he wasn\u2019t usually into playing as adults. Maybe a little weird in retrospect, but I didn\u2019t have much experience back then, and I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nThe story began on a rather sudden note. He introduced his OC, a lost child, almost immediately. My adult character goes to help her, but the OC is hungry, dirty, and her parents have been \u201cmurdered by Team Rocket\u201d (that\u2019s a little much for a Pokemon RP, but again, I didn\u2019t question it at the time. Maybe he meant gameverse Pokemon where Team Rocket is slightly more menacing than in the bumbling idiots from the cartoon.) So obviously, my adult characters call the police. She brings her into their home in the meantime, because what, is she going to leave a little kid out in the cold? This, apparently, was exactly what he wanted.\n\nBecause he keeps emphasizing that his character is starving, mine offers her some food. This is where I began to notice something a little\u2026 off. I have my character make a meal for his, and he proceeded to write how she ate in gratuitous detail. She eats macaroni with her hands, stuffing it down, getting cheese all over her face, belching, and ultimately demanding more. Okay, weird, but she is a starving child. Mine gets her more food and we repeat the process.\n\nAfter she eats disgustingly, she decides to go into my adult characters\u2019 bedroom and begin wrecking the place. She tears through their drawers for no specific reason, and comes across\u2026 her own birth certificate. Okay, we didn\u2019t agree on that, but let\u2019s see where it goes? After destroying their bedroom just because, she decides to run away into the forest (he took care to write that the police weren\u2019t coming for some unviable excuse) and gets attacked by bird Pokemon. His second child character, who has done virtually nothing up to this point, brings one of her mothers the OC\u2019s birth certificate she found while my other character saves his. So obviously now we\u2019re going to the hospital.\n\nSomehow, while his OC is being treated, a random doctor gives one of my characters a maternity test and determines that the OC is her long-lost daughter. Now I was getting a little annoyed and confused. He\u2019s godmodded my gay character into cheating on her wife with a man. I don\u2019t like conflict, so I scrambled to come up with the excuse that she was an IVF baby that one character had in secret while the other was doing humanitarian work in another part of the world, she never cheated, the OC wasn\u2019t t a bastard, ETC. Good God, I wrote literally ten paragraphs trying to justify his character\u2019s existence, and he didn\u2019t even have the decency to respond to it. All hell would break loose from there.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a beta, I let his doctor character pressure mine into taking her biological daughter home. It sounds like there might be some legal issues to contend with, but fine. The whole point of this RP is that she\u2019s going to get a Pokemon and learn how to become a good trainer, right? When they get home, his little OC goes hog-wild, getting into any kind of trouble she can get into. Destroying property, bloodying the other kid\u2019s nose, screaming, swearing, getting into all kinds of life-threatening situations short of putting a fork in an electrical outlet, and using homophobic slurs at her parents (yes, really). While this was going on, King started chatting me up in the DMs, asking a bunch of questions. Was I a woman? What was my favorite soda? I must be gay since I write gay characters, correct? I\u2019m put-off, but these were somewhat innocuous questions, so I answer honestly: Yes, Dr. Pepper, and yes, I am. He proceeded to tell me that he was bisexual (I didn\u2019t ask or care,) that he was autistic, he was adopted, and he really, really enjoyed our RP. I have a chronic issue of being too polite, so I indulged him. Big mistake.\n\nThe RP just became an absolute free-for-all. His character would eat like a pig, screech, hit, and be a monster (all while he wrote how cute and adorable she was.) Eventually he got tired of one child terrorizing the family and brought in another OC, a little boy, without my permission. Rinse and repeat the same damn thing, although I did have the spine to tell him to knock it off with the long-lost child thing. The children \u201ctawk wike dis\u201d and are, according to him, just the cutest thing in the world. I gave up on the Pokemon trainer plot. Eventually, he wrote the little boy peeing his pants on the couch. Yeah, I was not writing my character dealing with piss. That was where I decided to end it.\n\nOkay, sounds like a bad experience, right? So obviously I dumped him and moved on to RPers I jived a little better with, right?\n\nNo, because I am a people-pleaser who only recently learned how to say no. I did tell him that while the central characters were a family, the parent-child thing was not really supposed to be the point of the story. I wanted to write about Pokemon, not have my characters deal with pants-pissing, binge eating, and behaving like the possessed child in The Exorcist. We decided to try again, this time agreeing on a DC RP, followed by a Marvel RP once we finished. His characters weren\u2019t OCs. One was an adult villain from the Superman canon. Because he was adamant that he couldn\u2019t write adults, the story centered around her asking Doctor Fate to magically make her a child again so that she could redo her life and use her powers for good. Once she was \u201caged down,\u201d he predictably insisted that Clark Kent and Lois Lane (both played by me, because of course) \u201cadopt\u201d her and raise her to be good. Remember the utter chaos his OCs wreaked last time? Superman teaching her how to be a hero? That could be fun. But it just wound up being the same damn thing as last time. Except instead of homophobic slurs, his character insulted mine using pseudo-Kryptonian ones.\n\nKing was still chatting with me in the DMs. By this time, we\u2019ve established that he\u2019s nearly 400 pounds IRL. Again, I didn\u2019t ask or care. I stupidly told him that IRL I\u2019m 5\u20190\u201d and about 110 pounds. From then on, he talked about sitting on me a lot. I also stupidly told him I\u2019m biracial. He proceeded to ask strange questions about my mother\u2019s ethnicity. I\u2019m extremely invested in conserving our heritage, and I tolerated more iffy questions about our culture than I should have. He also made an antisemitic \u201cjoke\u201d when I revealed that my partner is Jewish. I am happy to say I had the nads to tell him not to say that shit. I am not happy to say I didn\u2019t cut him off then and there.\n\nSome time went by, and we began our Marvel RP. I was exasperated by it at the time, but if I go back and read it, it makes me laugh. My favorite hero has always been the Sub-Mariner, but unfortunately there exists an early 2000s comic series about his childhood. Guess what iteration of the character King wanted to RP? I was wary of his child characters at this juncture, but went ahead and did it (this time went with it mostly because how many opportunities will I have to do a Sub-Mariner RP? Not many, I can assure you!) I played almost everyone in the comic while he played the \u201caged down\u201d version of Namor. While I could see the real Namor screeching \u201cadorably\u201d and going around and tormenting the people of Atlantis just because he\u2019s Namor, I can not see him approaching Princess Fen after literally stabbing Attuma with a trident, telling her he\u2019s \u201chungwy,\u201d and that he would like some cake. No, I am not making this up. This is really how the RP went.\n\nSo how did this all come to an end? Well, eventually the weird questions and comments in the DMs became too much, and I simply told him I didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no climactic ending to this story, but for my own sanity I had to cut him off. I think I am better for the experience, because I learned how to advocate for myself a little better.",

            "selftext": "  \n\nThrowaway because anonymity.\n\nStrap in, because we\u2019re in for a wild ride here. This isn\u2019t a vent. I know I brought the whole experience on myself for not cutting this RPer off. I\u2019m just here to share the details, which are creepy/funny to look back on.\n\nAbout three years ago, I met \"King\" on a multi-fandom RP site. He approached me, seemed nice enough, and asked me if I wanted to RP with him. I was still new to the RP community, and I was open to far more than I am now that I\u2019ve discovered many new preferences and limits, so I said sure. We talked about fandoms and agreed on Pokemon, deciding to do a SOL story about a family of Pokemon trainers.\n\nFrom there, we assigned our characters. I was to play the parents (lesbian mothers) and he wanted to play their two kids. Not entirely my bag, as I\u2019d have preferred to play one parent and one child, but he insisted he wasn\u2019t usually into playing as adults. Maybe a little weird in retrospect, but I didn\u2019t have much experience back then, and I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nThe story began on a rather sudden note. He introduced his OC, a lost child, almost immediately. My adult character goes to help her, but the OC is hungry, dirty, and her parents have been \u201cmurdered by Team Rocket\u201d (that\u2019s a little much for a Pokemon RP, but again, I didn\u2019t question it at the time. Maybe he meant gameverse Pokemon where Team Rocket is slightly more menacing than in the bumbling idiots from the cartoon.) So obviously, my adult characters call the police. She brings her into their home in the meantime, because what, is she going to leave a little kid out in the cold? This, apparently, was exactly what he wanted.\n\nBecause he keeps emphasizing that his character is starving, mine offers her some food. This is where I began to notice something a little\u2026 off. I have my character make a meal for his, and he proceeded to write how she ate in gratuitous detail. She eats macaroni with her hands, stuffing it down, getting cheese all over her face, belching, and ultimately demanding more. Okay, weird, but she is a starving child. Mine gets her more food and we repeat the process.\n\nAfter she eats disgustingly, she decides to go into my adult characters\u2019 bedroom and begin wrecking the place. She tears through their drawers for no specific reason, and comes across\u2026 her own birth certificate. Okay, we didn\u2019t agree on that, but let\u2019s see where it goes? After destroying their bedroom just because, she decides to run away into the forest (he took care to write that the police weren\u2019t coming for some unviable excuse) and gets attacked by bird Pokemon. His second child character, who has done virtually nothing up to this point, brings one of her mothers the OC\u2019s birth certificate she found while my other character saves his. So obviously now we\u2019re going to the hospital.\n\nSomehow, while his OC is being treated, a random doctor gives one of my characters a maternity test and determines that the OC is her long-lost daughter. Now I was getting a little annoyed and confused. He\u2019s godmodded my gay character into cheating on her wife with a man. I don\u2019t like conflict, so I scrambled to come up with the excuse that she was an IVF baby that one character had in secret while the other was doing humanitarian work in another part of the world, she never cheated, the OC wasn\u2019t t a bastard, ETC. Good God, I wrote literally ten paragraphs trying to justify his character\u2019s existence, and he didn\u2019t even have the decency to respond to it. All hell would break loose from there.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a beta, I let his doctor character pressure mine into taking her biological daughter home. It sounds like there might be some legal issues to contend with, but fine. The whole point of this RP is that she\u2019s going to get a Pokemon and learn how to become a good trainer, right? When they get home, his little OC goes hog-wild, getting into any kind of trouble she can get into. Destroying property, bloodying the other kid\u2019s nose, screaming, swearing, getting into all kinds of life-threatening situations short of putting a fork in an electrical outlet, and using homophobic slurs at her parents (yes, really). While this was going on, King started chatting me up in the DMs, asking a bunch of questions. Was I a woman? What was my favorite soda? I must be gay since I write gay characters, correct? I\u2019m put-off, but these were somewhat innocuous questions, so I answer honestly: Yes, Dr. Pepper, and yes, I am. He proceeded to tell me that he was bisexual (I didn\u2019t ask or care,) that he was autistic, he was adopted, and he really, really enjoyed our RP. I have a chronic issue of being too polite, so I indulged him. Big mistake.\n\nThe RP just became an absolute free-for-all. His character would eat like a pig, screech, hit, and be a monster (all while he wrote how cute and adorable she was.) Eventually he got tired of one child terrorizing the family and brought in another OC, a little boy, without my permission. Rinse and repeat the same damn thing, although I did have the spine to tell him to knock it off with the long-lost child thing. The children \u201ctawk wike dis\u201d and are, according to him, just the cutest thing in the world. I gave up on the Pokemon trainer plot. Eventually, he wrote the little boy peeing his pants on the couch. Yeah, I was not writing my character dealing with piss. That was where I decided to end it.\n\nOkay, sounds like a bad experience, right? So obviously I dumped him and moved on to RPers I jived a little better with, right?\n\nNo, because I am a people-pleaser who only recently learned how to say no. I did tell him that while the central characters were a family, the parent-child thing was not really supposed to be the point of the story. I wanted to write about Pokemon, not have my characters deal with pants-pissing, binge eating, and behaving like the possessed child in The Exorcist. We decided to try again, this time agreeing on a DC RP, followed by a Marvel RP once we finished. His characters weren\u2019t OCs. One was an adult villain from the Superman canon. Because he was adamant that he couldn\u2019t write adults, the story centered around her asking Doctor Fate to magically make her a child again so that she could redo her life and use her powers for good. Once she was \u201caged down,\u201d he predictably insisted that Clark Kent and Lois Lane (both played by me, because of course) \u201cadopt\u201d her and raise her to be good. Remember the utter chaos his OCs wreaked last time? Superman teaching her how to be a hero? That could be fun. But it just wound up being the same damn thing as last time. Except instead of homophobic slurs, his character insulted mine using pseudo-Kryptonian ones.\n\nKing was still chatting with me in the DMs. By this time, we\u2019ve established that he\u2019s nearly 400 pounds IRL. Again, I didn\u2019t ask or care. I stupidly told him that IRL I\u2019m 5\u20190\u201d and about 110 pounds. From then on, he talked about sitting on me a lot. I also stupidly told him I\u2019m biracial. He proceeded to ask strange questions about my mother\u2019s ethnicity. I\u2019m extremely invested in conserving our heritage, and I tolerated more iffy questions about our culture than I should have. He also made an antisemitic \u201cjoke\u201d when I revealed that my partner is Jewish. I am happy to say I had the nads to tell him not to say that shit. I am not happy to say I didn\u2019t cut him off then and there.\n\nSome time went by, and we began our Marvel RP. I was exasperated by it at the time, but if I go back and read it, it makes me laugh. My favorite hero has always been the Sub-Mariner, but unfortunately there exists an early 2000s comic series about his childhood. Guess what iteration of the character King wanted to RP? I was wary of his child characters at this juncture, but went ahead and did it (this time went with it mostly because how many opportunities will I have to do a Sub-Mariner RP? Not many, I can assure you!) I played almost everyone in the comic while he played the \u201caged down\u201d version of Namor. While I could see the real Namor screeching \u201cadorably\u201d and going around and tormenting the people of Atlantis just because he\u2019s Namor, I can not see him approaching Princess Fen after literally stabbing Attuma with a trident, telling her he\u2019s \u201chungwy,\u201d and that he would like some cake. No, I am not making this up. This is really how the RP went.\n\nSo how did this all come to an end? Well, eventually the weird questions and comments in the DMs became too much, and I simply told him I didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no climactic ending to this story, but for my own sanity I had to cut him off. I think I am better for the experience, because I learned how to advocate for myself a little better.",

The first two problems have slowly diminished where I wouldn't call them problems anymore. But the plot is still so complicated that the rp feels one-sided. Like this is my partners story and I'm only here to have their character's love interest follow after them.\n\nProblem is, because of my people-pleaser nature, I told myself it will all make sense eventually so I've been responding to the best of my ability. Consequences of this are I'm just not invested in the story and I have no way to insert anything that would invest me because I'm lost in the plot. It's been almost two months since this rp started, and I don't know how to tell my partner that I don't think our story and writing is meshing with me.

Please remember that this is all 100% online, these are strangers, and unless you know them personally, please don\u2019t share your personal information. Context below and a TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nI was raised in a paranoid family. Definitely not \u201cvaccines have tracking chips\u201d paranoid but enough that we change our wifi password once every few months, update our security codes, tape over webcams, keep locks on our devices and accounts, etc etc. With all this security in place, I figured it would be just fine to roleplay and so I did. I\u2019d just gotten a replacement laptop for my birthday and a bunch of new (but necessary) tech stuff. I was ALWAYS careful. Never gave out personal information, I even lied about which side of the country I was on and, in some cases, which hemisphere. \n\nEventually met a guy who was real nice and we had a really good rp going. He was three years older than me and had already graduated college and offered multiple times to tutor me and stuff. I always turned it down because I genuinely didn\u2019t need the help, it was moreso just me whining about all the work I had to do. \n\nEvery now and then he\u2019d make these uncanny comments that weee spaced out just enough that I always considered them coincidental. Ex. We were talking casually about a scene in which my main and my secondary character go shopping to bond together and I joked about them both debating what colors would look good on my main. He joked along too and said he and his sister (irl) do the same and he bet that I probably had a lot of greens in my closet. I did. Other times it was about pets and he joked about how I\u2019d probably be the crazy bird lady, not the crazy cat lady (I DID own several birds at the time). \n\nI got really freaked out when he said he was taking a road trip to see some friends and was coming to my state. This was over discord and he quickly edited his comment to say the name of the state, instead of \u201cyour state\u201d which really weirded me out. I went radio silent, using finals as an excuse. Weeks later he sends me discord message with progression pictures of my street sign, then the front of my apartment complex, then him pushing the correct floor number, and finally ending with a picture of the front of my door captioned with \u201cguess where I am lol surprise!!!\u201d And a bunch of emojis. \n\nWe called the police immediately and they were able to catch him. It turns out this fucker had been hacking into my webcam. The usual tape I put over my webcam had been removed and I\u2019m so used to never using the webcam anyway (plus I use black electrical tape so it blends in and doesn\u2019t distract me from my screen) that I didn\u2019t notice.\n\nHe watched me study, watched me game, watched me change and undress. He had screenshots over the course of months. Suffice it to say we got rid of everything, packed our stuff, and moved as soon as we were able. \n\nJust please be careful. \n\nTL;DR - creepy stalker hacked my webcam and watched me for months while rping with me.",

(I'm now 28)\n\nBut, even with like 14 years of roleplaying experience, I always feel a sense of *dread* whenever someone answers my ads. Seeing that new message icon doesn't make me excited, it makes me uneasy. *Especially* now that discord is like, the new standard. IMs are like the bane of my existence whenever it comes to communicating for the first time, as I feel as if I don't have the luxury of mentally preparing myself in coordinating a response. (otherwise, discord is great for roleplay and is a game changer for channel organization). I just feel so much more pressure whenever it's an instant message setting with someone I'm not acquainted with yet.\n\nOnce I'm adjusted to someone and know what to expect, things go a lot smoothly usually. Especially if I vibe with someone and we bounce ideas easily back and forth and we seem to be on the same page. But it's always those introduction phases that are the hardest for me. And sometimes it takes me way longer than it should just to reply to people's first inquiry messages (sometimes hours, sometimes days \ud83d\ude05)\n\nAlthough funnily, it feels much easier for me to reply to other people's ads. It's whenever I receive ad inquiries that I feel mini-panic with getting messages in my inbox, or with exchanging discord information. \n\nIs this normal for you folks?",

            "selftext": "If there's something I've learned in roleplaying over the years, it's that it's probably best to save certain intimate details of your life away from RP partners until you're comfortable (or you don't have to... like... at all). I prefer it that way, as it can get pretty uncomfortable if someone spews some intimate detail of their life before you're comfortable with a person...\n\nWell, I'm currently 8 months pregnant. Or just about, anyway. To some, this could *easily* be TMI, or too personal. And I've actually seen ads where people put under their limits, \"Pregnancy\"&lt;- Obviously, that's for in the roleplay, right? Well. Not always. I've seen people (more than once!) include, \"Not even OOC discussion.\"\n\nIt's just kind of a topic not a lot of people wanna get into. And I get it. Earlier on, it wasn't even something I disclosed with partners unless I got the vibe that we were chill and it wouldn't bug them. (Or if I'd been writing with them awhile and we obviously friends)\n\nWell. Here I am now. I haven't started a new RP in months, but I had a certain plot itch to scratch, so I go and try and seek out a new partner... But, now, in a month from now, I'm going to be having a damn baby. lol. In a month from now, I may have days, or even a few weeks where I probably won't be able to write, and it may throw off my schedule substantially. I think that's probably something prospective partners *should know*, but I also know, pregnancy is weird for some people and they just don't want to hear/know about it. It can make them uncomfortable...\n\nI actually did a trial run of this with a prospective partner I'm in discussion phases with currently. I decided to drop the ball, and give them that disclaimer after we got a little ways in (but not too deep) into the discussion process of the plot. I haven't heard back from them on it yet, but I'm not going to jump to the conclusion that they decided to ditch either (I'm pretty patient with response times), but I'm also thinking like: Damn, I would not be surprised if that ran them off.\n\nBut, thoughts?\n\nI don't want to *not* tell them and then whenever my due date comes along I'm just all of a sudden \"Hey sorry, I'm going to be gone for a bit!\", I want to give them a heads up. \n\nShould I disclose I'm pregnant?\n\nShould I just be vague and say, \"Hey, a month from now I may be gone for a bit?\"\n\nOr, should I just wait until after the baby is here to even find a new roleplay? (Honestly, probably the best choice, but man I wanted to do this plot xD)\n\ntl;dr: Should I disclose my pregnancy (new) partners so they know what to expect in a months time?",

English is my 3rd/4th language and I\u2019ve only been decent at it for the past 3-4 years.

Yet still, the people who show interest in them somehow either ignore it or think they match it when in reality they don\u2019t\u2026? I must sound so mean, I know.

I want to know how do you guys stop from masturbating during the roleplay? I can generally control myself, but most of the times I get too tempted and I just jerk off. If not during the roleplay, then after the roleplay. Does anyone here can help me? Any advices are welcome. Thank you",

They had no idea what any of my prompts were and at that point suggested we try something else, instead of maybe looking into the genre/ideas I had.  So, I showed him the fantasy setting I had.\n\nThat's where it went downhill.\n\nThis dude consistently tried hitting on me, being overly perverse, constantly tried to push me into ERP into any story we discussed.  After a few hours of trying to tell him I am not interested in anything OOC, politely I had to explain that I am taken and am not interested in doing anything OOC whether it be sexting, flirting or otherwise.  Unable to take the hint, he kept at it after saying he could cool his heels.\n\nHe also was very insulting to my character choices, told me to change them up because he'd prefer to have a sexual RP -- even though I just explained that sex RP happens only organically for my characters and no other reason.   He didn't like that and I told his straight out: We are not compatible in any way, shape or form as partners.  He's too sexual and crossed enough boundaries that I had to bring out that I'm taken, which did not circumvent his pushiness.  He  was rude, disrespectful, bad-mannered, doesn't like to take \"no\" as an answer and he isn't even a good writer either.  This dude literally said: I want to fuck you through your character.  \n\nJust overall a bad experience with a person who just could not chill out and stop being a pervert OOC  or respect boundaries.\n\nYou might even say he wasn't a professional.",
