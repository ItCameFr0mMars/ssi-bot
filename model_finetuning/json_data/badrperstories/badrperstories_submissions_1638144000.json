It's meant to be a more light-hearted way of poking fun. I am sorry if I offend someone with this, though if anyone does find themselves feeling personally attacked, I'd maybe take a moment to think back and see if you've found yourself banned from a few places, blocked without warning...   \n\n\nI can tell you that no one has ever verbatim said any of these quotes. These are just how what they actually say comes across.   \n\n\nLike, when someone just comes into a server I help out in and one of the things they say in their first interaction with the staff is bringing up a server *they* run and how successful it was, all I hear is \"I'm flexing on you now, this is a warning shot to let you know that I will act like a mod to your players and I will argue with you about everything because I believe my ways are better.\" And more often than not, the servers they're bragging about aren't running anymore.   \n\n\nAnother example is the big about wanting to instantly be a main character. It's usually communicated either with constant whining / guilt-trips about how no one wants to write with their character, or it's shown by the creation of a Mary-Sue with a writer who will actively shame other writers whose characters don't immediately love theirs.   \n\n\nThe red flag one is never someone verbalizing \"my feelings matter more than yours,\" but it usually presents when they get corrected on something and suddenly they go from a pleasant person to kind of a jerk. They then bring up some type of disorder, usually one of the big 3 (Depression, Anxiety, BPD),  instead of an apology for lashing out, as a way to excuse their verbal abuse. It does not matter if you empathize with them and share that you also struggle with that so you understand, because it'll repeat every time. If you say you need space from the conversation, they will continue to berate you, no matter that you've expressed a boundary.   \n\n\nI know I definitely missed a lot of warning signs, but I got a laugh out of making this. Enjoy and happy holidays!",

            "selftext": " Ok, so...I'm honestly not sure if this would be really considered a bad RP story, but I just wanted to share my experience when I tried role-playing.\n\n Now, I personally can't RP as canon characters. I don't know why, but I just can't get myself into their mindset and whatnot. I've tried, a bajillion times, but it just never worked out for me. So I preferred role-playing as myself. I know, I know, super weird! But that's how I was when I used to try and role-play with people. I never role-played anything above 18+, just personal preference. I did try role-playing as my own OC, once, but it never stuck.\n\n So, when I role-play as myself, I can't help but feel like a kid in a candy store whenever I talked with other characters. I mean, seriously, I know it will never come true, but I dreamed of being able to meet my favorite characters. I admit, I still kinda do (I know, I have no life). So even just role-playing, talking to a character felt amazing. I guess I was in some sort of weird phase or something. I don't know.\n\n Well, unfortunately, my interest in role-playing died, after a while. People kept ghosting me or simply just flat-out ignoring me...and I do understand that real life happens, people move on, etc etc. But whenever I would see them post a starter thing or whatever, and I would leave a nice comment, I never got a response. Ever. And a few of the role-playing blogs I had followed, I think they were abandoned, but that's just whatever. What bothers me is being completely ignored. I'm aware that I can get a bit overexcited, probably, but I did really try to keep myself reigned back because I was starting to feel like I was just being annoying, no matter how nice I was. But even so, I was still constantly ignored and/or ghosted. It only made me feel like I was being super annoying, and because of that, I'm really hesitant to role-play, again, ever...anywhere. I try to be nice, I try as hard as possible to not be annoying because gosh I hate that feeling! But it was never enough. So, I think after about a month or two, I just quit and went back to sharing or posting whatever. \n\n Call me a child, but one of my biggest pet-peeves is being ignored. Maybe that just stems from me being born the middle-child in my family...but in a way, being ignored especially like that does kinda sting. Especially when I try my very best to be really nice, and that's just who I am in general. But now, I have this fear that I'm the most annoying person in the world, and that's why nobody ever responded to me.\n\n Anyway, so that was my experience. It's been a few years, now, and part of me kinda wants to try again, but I'm not gonna push it. I have my other hobbies. I just wanted to share my story. Also, I am sorry if this sounded all over the place. I'm not good at explaining things, well, unfortunately. Also, if I chose the wrong flair for this, please let me know, and I'll change it. Thank you, and thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, this prompt once handed over me by someone who replies 1-2 months so needless to say I havent got the progression I need. So I've decided to use the prompt and find partner who'll give more frequent responses. So far I've found four in months which all ended up ghosting me. I was wondering what is not good in your opinion at this prompt and what could be changed:\n\n**Injustice For All:**\nThe prompt is a woman who's been working as a sidekick for a man/woman and both are superheroes in a city. The issue is from outside they may seem like an excellent duo who's completing each other and striking against villains but harsh reality is the main hero never finds sidekick's efforts efficient or enough. Always hurts her and does horrible things. Resulting in the sidekick feeling unworthy and insignificant.\n\nThat's where my character aka villain comes in. I have sth written for that actually so lemme past it here:\n\nHer name, age will be unknown, her looks and her powers as well. All known is she's the supreme leader of a crime organization called \"Injustice For All\" (I4A for short). She very rarely shows up and even she does nobody could tell anything about her because she never leaves nobody alive to tell so. Her organization single handedly runs all sugar, cigar, piracy and illegal affairs on that country. She usually sends her men to deal her jobs and problems. Only men too see her and be alive is Eclipse and Solstice. She runs the country with an iron hand. All politicans, president, any citizen of that country is on her mercy every second. She doesn't like these two heroes messing with her affairs but wants to keep her identity safe so she keeps a low profile.\n\nStory will start with heroes trying to stop mafia's (villain) illegal activities. Sometimed they'll succed sometimes they wont but in both ends hero is gonna beat her and make the sidekick feel sad. And this'll be seen by the villain who thinks to take advantage of such occurance. She comes up with a plan to reveal main hero's real personality and his true self with her plan, making sure to show sidekick to see the reality. But after all those pain she's been severly her body is on so bad condition, her soul is even worse.",

            "selftext": "NO JOKES THIS TIME FOLKS THIS IS GONNA BE A DOOZY AND TBH MIGHT START CRYING DURING THIS AS ITS A PRETTY TOUGH SUBJECT FOR ME.\n\n\nSo this happened about almost a year ago and I\u2019m still wondering if maybe I was the problem. \n\nSo I was a part of a rp group that was relatively small. I was friends with everyone there however butted heads with three individuals ( I am changing their names ), Clary, Jaz and Nick. Me and Nick managed to work through our differences and became close friends. However I had no luck with Clary and Jaz. \n\nThey both had an issue of blatantly ignoring me when it came to trying to engage with them in rp. And well\u2014- actually everyone that wasn\u2019t themselves or Nick. They basically stayed in their own little world and would promise that they weren\u2019t leaving me out and that they were gonna give me some plot hooks with them. But those never came and the almost like clockwork would both be conveniently \u201c busy \u201c the moment I\u2019d bring it up. \n\nWould claim I \u201c only made characters for ships \u201c when that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth as I stayed in that group for almost a year and had maybe 10 ships to my name and over a dozen OCs. All of these ships being with Nick and one other close friend. Both of which who came to me, not the other way around. \n\nThey claimed I didn\u2019t make good plots, or that I was \u201c hard to rp with \u201c, I stole Faceclaims from them ( majorly this was Jaz\u2019s gripe about me not Clary\u2019s ) and they were tired of me bugging them. \n\nAll behind my back and the only reason why I knew is because they would call Nick to tell him all this stuff so that way he didn\u2019t have any physical proof in the case he told me. Which he did. \n\nI decided to just say forget it and move on. ( I was like 18-19 at this point )\n\nNick invites a close friend ( now ex friend ) named Maria. Maria joins and gets in VC and we all greet them. They seem nice and very pleasant if not a tad eccentric. Me and Maria hit it off and become friends as well and they start making characters. I started shipping with them. All is well. \n\nWell. Apparently Clary and Jaz did NOT like this nor did they like Maria. It started when I used a FC after asking if anyone was using it and almost everyone said no one is using it. Jaz comes in chat and pings me and starts RAVING about how I\u2019m again stealing their FCs on purpose to make them mad. How I need to get my own, and stop trying to sneak my way into taking them. I calmly tell Jazz that I didn\u2019t know and pull up screen shots of people telling me no one is using it. They pull up their own screen shot of them going \u201c man I kinda wanna use this FC but I don\u2019t know \u201c and posting a picture\u2026.almost 5 months ago. And I asked if the FC was already a character and they said \u201c I\u2019m getting to it, I just need to figure out what I\u2019m gonna do with them. \u201c no reserve no nothing. I meekly apologize and this is where Maria comes in. \n\nThey start pushing back against Jaz saying they need fo fuck off and just give me the damn FC cause it\u2019s clear they\u2019re just hoarding. Jaz gets upset and Clary tries to defend them only to get chewed out herself. And they both go offline with Jaz just telling me to take the FC. \n\nFrom there Maria was very vocal about not letting them walk all over me and for a time things got better. Until they didn\u2019t. \n\nNick started having issues with Jaz and Clary and would vent to us about it as we are the only ones in the group that understood. Mostly everyone else loved them. Well Maria takes it upon themselves to go to Jaz and Clary and try to call them out in our own private Group Chat ( that was made when we were all \u201c friends \u201c ) and call them terrible people and saying that they know they talk about me and Nick and a few others. It escalates until eventually Jaz and Clary yielded and issued everyone a personal apology including me before dropping the issue. \n\nFrom there they both start to rp with more people. I get a few ships from them but for the most part we keep our distances. At this point Maria is semi satisfied but ends up getting banned after dog cussing out a minor who didn\u2019t realize Maria was trans, and used the wrong pronouns for them. ( along with Maria going out their way to antagonize Jaz almost every single day even after the apology and better behavior ) \n\nMe and Nick feel sorry for Maria so. We make a three person GC separate from the others so they can vent as they were SUPER devastated about being banned ( they said they had bipolar disorder and didn\u2019t mean to blow up like that ). We play video games together, call, and start planning rps with Maria. \n\nMeanwhile me and Nick still use the server and just rp with everyone and keep contact with Jazz and Clary very brief. As they claimed they were not leaving and neither were we as we had plots going on. And it wasn\u2019t like it was some requirement to talk to them. We tell Maria about what\u2019s going on in the group from time to time. Vent. But otherwise all is quiet. \n\nOr at least I thought.\n\nMaria asks us if Clary and Jaz still mentions them. I tell them the truth that occasionally they do but me and Nick check them, they\u2019ll backtrack and apologize then we move on. Maria vents about how they can\u2019t believe they are still so \u201c obsessed \u201c and me and Nick go \u201c yeah but we make sure to keep them in line and not let them say anything out of pocket. \u201c which was the truth. Maria goes quiet and I go to bed. As my depression tends to make me sleep way more than I mean to. \n\nI woke up to absolute hell. \n\nMissed messages from Clary demanding to know how many group chats I\u2019m in ( at the time I didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about ) and DEMANDED she be allowed access to all of them. \n\nI ask her what she means and she tells me that she knows I\u2019m in 5 different group chats to talk shit. And now I\u2019m really lost ( as that is very clearly not true ) \n\nI get a VERY lengthy Private from Jaz about how they never want me to talk to them ever again, how I\u2019m a snake and a liar and they\u2019ll never recover from this. \n\nThe GC with Maria is blowing up as well with Nick and Maria going back and forth and it\u2019s all going too fast and I feel sick to my stomach. \n\nEventually Nick messages me having a panic attack. I calm him down. Ask him what\u2019s wrong? Apparently after our talk with Maria they took it upon themselves to screen shot ever private convo we had with them venting about Clary and Jaz ( old and new ), complied it and sent Clary and Jaz a copy, bragging about how much we hate them and how we only love Maria and that they should just disappear. \n\nI\u2019m floored. I almost think it\u2019s not true. Until Clary sends me the screenshots she got and again demands access to those \u201c multiple GCs. \u201c I\u2019m literally pale and I\u2019m forced to leave the rp group. All my friends and plots and everything gone in one single night when things were getting good. Nick follows close behind. \n\nNick tells Maria to their face they never want to speak to or associate with them again to which all they get from Maria is a \u201c k \u201c and some minor explanation that they were tired of Jaz and Clary smearing their name supposedly. And \u2018 I\u2019m sorry but please don\u2019t talk behind my back guys. \u2018 ( Maria\u2019s own words to us ).\n\nI go to Maria asking if they\u2019re okay. They tell me they don\u2019t know anymore. And I tell them that I am very hurt by what they did, sharing my private convos with them. And how they all but ruined my chance to ever get my plots back. I tell them though I understand their perspective and wish not to drop them but I would need some time to recover. \n\nTheir response? \n\nThey tell me I might as well not come back as there is no point in being my friend anymore and they plan to never speak to me again.\n\nThat\u2019s it. No explanation, no nothing. To which I just go \u201c okay \u201c and block Maria, Jaz and Clary. \n\nI still to this day wonder if maybe I should have been supportive and left when Maria was banned or maybe just spared Maria\u2019s feelings or idk. But I feel guilty. AITA? \n\nI would put a TLDR but I feel like all this context is needed. But generally premise, my personal Privates with a friend are leaked as a revenge plot against my will which ends with me losing everything.",

Everything was fine for only like a month before the issues started, I found out the hard way she was one of those people who get wayyyy too invested emotionally in their characters and can't tell the difference between game and real life and if I tried to let my character have friends, get a crush, or joke around OOC with their players, she would flip because she felt she was getting set aside. \n\nI somewhat tried to endure it since a lot of times she wouldn't complain directly to me and in the forum I play on there are weird and toxic friendships so she was off fightning with the other people I played with, which were her friends, and not with me (even if they told me about it and she was all passive aggressive every time we spoke or played).\n\nThen some months ago I tried again to let my character have a romantic relationship and as usual she read those threads and one day went to yell directly at me because I had included a pet our twins had adopted together in the storyline with his love interest, saying 'it was too important', it shouldn't be used with other people and she had felt hurt irl over it, I snapped back but still gave in and modified the story I was playing not to include it. She never thanked me or said anything again about it and that was the last straw, early this year I was not that active since I had covid so I slowly let the relationship between our characters die and kinda... ghosted her on game? by dropping our thread together. \n\nAnd now that I'm more or less back to playing she's off power/metaplaying her way through this '''separation''' by moving my character and saying they fought using only out of character talk to justify everything because she never bothered to check on me and ask me what she should do, if I wanted to continue, if I was fine with her playing things I sure as hell didn't wrote and never agreed to. Which was the nail in the coffin, but then I talked to one of those players involved (which is still friends with her too) and she made me feel guilty because she kept going on about how 'it was because of miscommunication, you don't talk enough to each other' and 'it was an important relationship!!' and it just drives me insane. \n\nTl;dr: Player tried to control and judge everything I ever wrote with the character tied to hers to the point it was stressing me out in real life, I ran but now I feel guilty.",

So since it's such a big timeskip there's a lot to write about for what happened within that time gap. I end it with having my character be open to be approached since their character was supposed to be approaching mine. We had discussed this.\n\nThey wrote all the way to the limit that the app allows (200 characters or something. Not words, characters.) And they seem impressed with themselves for that and say that they \"basically wrote a mini fanfiction\" and I'm like, okay. And so I read what they wrote but they didn't have the part where their character approaches mine or even had their character in the same building. \n\nI was reading it and being confused whenever they messaged again saying that they were cut off by the character limit or they would've written more. I understand that some people can get intimidated by long lengths so I assume that they were afraid of scaring me or something and I say \"Oh that's fine, you can send another message\"\n\nThey respond by refusing to do so because they \"basically wrote a mini fanfiction\" even though they didn't leave it off in a way that I could respond to? I don't know, they made a really big deal about how they wrote SOOO much and couldn't possibly write more (200 characters) and acted like I was being unreasonable for asking then to write just a little bit more on what we agreed on.\n\nI was going to just deal with it but I was so annoyed that I just left. I may be in the wrong here but I'm usually a lot better with communication and I got annoyed with them so much and the story wasn't even that good.",

And being a minor on Reddit who's actively looking for roleplays on different subreddits comes with a fair share of challenges. Because I know that a lot of creeps exist, I usually analyze the accounts that show interest in my RP ads before responding to them. Like, I just check their past posts and comment history, which may sound creepy but it\u2019s saved me before from a rather questionable person.\n\nThe dilemma that I face now has to do with NSFW accounts. I know that an account being marked as NSFW doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the person is an adult - or at least I don\u2019t think so? Since I\u2019m a minor, I only roleplay with minors and I\u2019m very careful regarding that when selecting roleplay partners. But there is also a likely chance that the person is. So in this case, what should I do? It\u2019s impossible looking through every post a person made to see if they give away that they\u2019re an adult and even if they do make NSFW posts, it\u2019s not like a minor can\u2019t do that?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

            "selftext": "So I'm a very low energy person; I just always have been, even as a kid. My OOC talk is pretty straightforward, and my explanations of things are fairly short. Once we get into actually planning the roles and events, though, I can go on for hours. I know how this can come off to others, but I just can't seem to figure out how to make it known that I am very interested (even if I tell them I'm interested). \n\nThe other day, I answered an ad (no hate to this person; they were lovely; we just didn't seem to mesh well). They wanted explanations as to why I liked the plot and their characters. I gave them a short, simple explanation, but it seemed to upset them. They were nice enough to explain that they wanted someone enthusiastic about the role, and we were not a good fit. I was enthusiastic, but I have a hard time expressing that through messages, especially when I don't know the person well. Tone is super hard for me to convey over text. \n\nI don't think I'm a lazy roleplayer, as I tend to drive the stories just as much as my partners. My replies are fairly long, 5+ paragraphs. I'm pretty detailed as well, but I feel like my OOC talk is what causes me to lose potential partners. \n\nThis is just a rant about myself and nothing else. I just needed to get it off my chest. \n\n*Also, if you have tips on how to come off as more enthusiastic through text, please let me know.*",

A day later, the same person commented how she was trying to do something on the profile and as time went on, there were more posts on this supposedly dead person's profile by the same sister. A few posts that stood out to me was the sister saying how she'd beat this person in tik tok followers and showed a video of a tik tok where a person who looked like the one who had died was seen. (This person had done a face reveal at one point) They also started asking to do roleplay's on this account. A while later, I tried to see if the post saying that this person was dead was still up and it was gone. Do you think I'm looking to far into this? Does this have a reasonable explanation?",

            "selftext": "Honestly I had forgotten all about this until not long ago. \n\nSo I had this online friend of mine that I did several RPs with over the course of 2 years, at the time. A lot of them died but 2 of them somehow kept going strong. For two years. Obviously... I got bored. And one day I decided to end it. And wow was that day dramatic. So I basically told them I had lost interest in the RPs and would no longer be active in them. Weelll they didn't like that very much. They were actually pretty angry at me because of how much time and emotion they had invested into it and they kept going on about how the RPs were everything to them. I just got fed up and said I don't care and that's when they called me a bad and selfish friend. \n\nAt that point I was just done. I wasn't going to do the RPs anymore, so I more or less said 'ig I'm selfish'. We went back and forth and that part ended with me just blocking them. You'd think that'd be the end of it, buuttt no. See, we were friends for two years. Had two more accounts on two different platforms they could and did message me on, and I blocked them on both of them too. Now you'd think that would be the end of it, but no. they messaged an IRL friend of mine who wasn't even in the RP scene and asked her to ask me if I could unblock them. I eventually did, and we talked for a bit. I wasn't going to do the RP anymore and that was that. Until a few months later I got roped back into doing the exact same RPs bc I hardly ever can say no and not long after I ended it again. And THEN it happened AGAIN... Except this time when I wanted to end it I just Ghosted them completely. That was only 4 or 5 months ago and we haven't talked since. \n\nHonorable mention: \nThey couldn't really take any criticism of their art (which is understandable) but had no problem making fun of mine (although I was fully aware of how bad it was) and putting it as the logo of our discord server.",

But it's been about a week and while that isn't awful in itself (I've had to wait way longer on past partners), it's a little wierd to me cause..again, they've been VERY good at telling me when they'll be gone for a bit, or if they're particularly busy- usually it only goes a few days *at most* before then atleast give me a heads up.\n\nWhen's a good time to ask them if everything is still going smoothly? I don't want them to think I'm trying to rush them into anything, cause I really don't mind if they are busy and/or need a break, i more of less just wanna know if they're generally doing okay, and also If there's anything within our roleplay or something I did that could've possibly caused the absence. \nThey don't seem to be put off by me; they still have me added and haven't left the server so I think that's a good sign. \n\nI'm very sorry if I already come across as kind of desperate or possibly wierd for even asking \"Hey, how do I speak to someone\", but I genuinely struggle with social cues, or general community ^^\u00b0",

However I've never had anything against including sexual scenes in a roleplay. \nIf it happens, it happens- if our characters having a sexual relationship makes sense, then I'm completely fine with including that element.\n\nI try to be as flexible as I can- I try to vary the personalities within my characters, Ill gladly try out a new writing style, I'll explore genres I haven't done before- cause I want my partner to have fun with ME, not only the other way around.\n\nHowever no matter what, I can't really get myself to play anything BUT a bottom. And that sounds like a really stupid complaint/vent, however I see posts about similar situations often enough, and it's make me kind of paranoid.\nI think alot of people's issues comes with the very obviously stereotypical \"uwu bottom\" chatacter, and I genuinely don't think I go under that trope- but maybe I've misunderstood and the issue really is the lack of flexibility. \n\nIt's not even a case of \"that doesn't turn ME on\" cause again, I dont even really roleplay for that purpose- I'm not here to get off. But it's a genuine discomfort to write. I don't know why, or where it came from, but I never felt it was an issue before recently.\n\nDoes this make me a bad roleplayer at all?",

When I was younger and roleplaying, whenever someone would describe a plot to me I could instantly imagine a whole world practically and come up with characters on the fly. However now I find it extremely difficult to stay immersed in a story or to picture some things.\n\nSo now I have started making a Pinterest board for characters and stories that I\u2019m doing! I keep them private of course, but I\u2019ve noticed that it had really helped me a lot. It even gets me super excited to roleplay again and I just wanted to share this just in case someone may be having the same issue I used to have. Now, you can do this with really any social media app, but I\u2019ve noticed that I really enjoy Pinterest because you can get \u2018more ideas\u2019 to add to your board. \n\nAnyways, this may be a super useless post but I just wanted to share.

The person mentioned that they don't want anyone to steal and repost their idea and it specified that they also don't want anyone to steal their limits/requirements.\n\nNow I understand the idea that someone would take and re-use a prompt, and how that might be uncomfortable to the person who originally wrote it, especially in the same forum.  It might limit their amount of potential partners and if it's something super unique that included their own worldbuilding (for example names of cities and so on) I totally get being annoyed about it. Although I do think that some people take it too far, and suspect that everyone 'stole' their plot even though the idea is very basic (for example something like: famous canon character has a secret daughter that falls in love  with other canon character, or any prompt that is basically just priestxdemon and so on) and it is much more likely that someone just had the same idea, especially if it's worded in a completely different way.\n\nBut why the hell should someone steal someone's requirements?  Her limits/requirements were just stuff like 'I want to write on discord/whatsapp',  'we should discuss boundaries beforehand and boundaries shouldn't be crossed' or 'write daily/be creative'. Do people really think that this basic stuff is so good that people are like 'Hmmm alright, I'm going to steal that.' Aren't people's limits/requirements so unique that it wouldn't even make sense to 'steal them', and if you already have the same requirements, should you just be like 'Ah, I want to write on discord and write daily, but Nachtreiher already wrote that in their last search search under requirements, damn, I guess I will think of something more unique.' And even if someone 'stole' someone's requirements/limits word for word...I literally don't see how that would hurt or influence the original poster in any way? I don't know, for me, it came across as a little bit paranoid.",

In a recent thread I mentioned that if I'm rping with a male writer and there is a focus on an MxF pairing where I\u2019m writing the male character (and they the female), I feel like they\u2019ll just immediately spot everything \u201coff\u201d or overly tropey about my male character. I feel not only will I then be completely turned off to the rp, but I\u2019ll also be shoehorned into writing *only* females with that partner.\n\nI never feel like this when writing with other females.\n\nObviously with something like gender it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a stone tablet with the ten commandments of manhood and male behaviour, but nevertheless a voice in my head will say \u201cyour partner will think your character is a fraud\u201d and that has often been enough to make me pass on starting an rp like that. I'm not sure if I\u2019d care so much if the rps were 100% smut-free, but I always like to have smut *somewhere* in the rp, even if it\u2019s very rare.\n\n**Does anyone else relate to this feeling? Male writers, how often do you come across this in female writers \u2013 how do you deal with that? Do or have you ever felt the inverse awkwardness?**\n\nOn the one hand it feels like an arbitrary and pointless limitation as I\u2019m making assumptions about what my partner is thinking, but I\u2019m also not game for mutually disappointing experiences...I\u2019d consider this particular awkwardness my weakest point as a roleplayer.\n\n**Knowledge/expertise**\n\nSomething more concrete is when the theme of the rp is something which my partner is *exceptionally* knowledgeable in, yet I am not.\n\nExample: I had someone that wanted a military simulation type of rp from me. She happened to be very much military career-orientated in real life. In this case I tried to write for her, but she was underwhelmed. She wanted the real detail and realism.\n\nAnother one: at a later date, someone wanted to do a hard sci-fi with me. IRL they were also a scientist within a field directly relevant to the underpinnings of the rp. I was/am not an expert in this field. All I could think was *how the hell can I convincingly write for a person with literal years of experience over me in something I\u2019ve never studied*, and especially when they want hard detail!? I told them it wouldn\u2019t work out, based on previous experience.\n\n**Age**\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that many roleplayers write main characters proximal to their real-life age OR in an age group they have already experienced. I always try to write a diverse range of character ages in my worlds, but I *know* my characters of say 40+ can feel incomplete even to me. How then are those characters going to seem authentic to rpers 10+ years older than me? I lack that perspective.\n\n**So anyway,** \n\nit\u2019s not that I\u2019m not willing to do research for my roleplays, and I think some things are far more achievable than others, but please understand I only have *so much* perspective I can give in any roleplay.\n\nStill, in the future I\u2019d like to do away with the (not so) subtle pessimism towards all this, as I think it also leads to stagnation. Obviously, I\u2019ve only given my experiences here, but I know this comes up in relation to all sorts of things.\n\n*Do you resonate with this, or are you more of a \u201cgive it a go and I\u2019ll have fun anyway\u201d type of person?*   \n*What\u2019s your approach?*  \n*How do you handle upsets or criticisms around this topic \u2013 is it worth persisting?*  \n*Any hard limits, or have you avoided this issue entirely?*  \n*Do you even consider this an issue?*\n\n**Tl;Dr: people keep asking this cow for eggs. What do? DAE?**",

            "selftext": "I'm sure we've been there...You message someone about an ad or maybe they message you...and suddenly you're left doing the talking while getting a few words back. The conversation is woefully one-sided and off-balance. You suggest ideas or try to float concepts/characters and the other person isn't engaging or seemingly aware of what topic is even being discussed. They seem passive but also slightly picky without picking a stance.\n\nWhat's even worse (IMO) is asking about their boundaries (characters, ships, mature content, genre, and such) and them saying they're fine and for you to suggest something and for them to shoot it down without any alternative. \n\nLike, I genuinely don't mind adhering to someone's boundaries or limits when it comes to writing BUT I hate when they say they have no preference or don't care what character I play, only to have them do a sudden 180 at my inquiry, as it makes for terrible communication. \n\nJust tell me first so I can adjust my brainstorming. I even ask if they have limits but then it baffles me when the next message is them snuffing out my concepts. If someone can't be explicit about what does or, at the very least, doesn't interest them, then I get really worried that once we jump into things, they'll be going through the motions, still not contributing. And I hate feeling like my partner is just drifting along. I hate doing all the work and to feel like a GM/DM in a one on one situation. Again, I don't mind limits, it's good to discuss them sooner than later, but I just don't like lazy communicators who are only half-paying attention to what's going on in the first stage of discussing. It doesn't make me excited to keep dragging conversation along if I can't trust them to be honest without me forcing their hand.\n\nIf someone can't contribute to the plot and have a discussion, rather than a few choppy exchanges of 'Yeah that's fine. Or 'I'm cool with whatever.' then I'm gonna have a bad time and just cut my losses now. It sucks too, because some of the fandoms I like, are niche, along with the ships and I don't mind parting ways if we're not on the same page but I hate that it takes so much forceful prodding to get some people to voice their opinion. I don't wanna get my hopes up or waste anyone's time.\n\nSupposedly my last long term partner didn't even like our RP in the end and I got the vibe he was mentally checked out...but they never spoke up about their disinterest even with me checking in on him a few times. Like, I can't help fix something if I don't know it's broken, dude. \n\nI know communication is difficult but I just wish I had partners who could give as much they take. I love to make my partners happy, I love to chat and discuss but a dead or uneven OOC with someone can really sink a story, before it begins or even during a great period of writing. It's getting harder to find someone I 'click' with as I get older...grumble grumble.",

It's just been so hard for me to find collaborative, creative, and non-hostile partners at this point.  \n\n\nI had an amazing partner once (I made a separate post about that partner) and they dipped after they decided to take a break from writing. It made me feel incredibly upset, because somewhere deep inside of my heart, I knew that my picky self would never have a high quality roleplay after that specific roleplay.   \n\n\nI proved myself wrong, and actually found some decent partners with really good ideas that can mesh well with mine. Our ideas were so harmonic, and none of us had any disagreements against each other's ideas. I felt like I was going to have a well-constructed roleplay once again. Oh, never mind, they ghosted me in the middle of our OOC discussion, how nice.  \n\n\nThat's fine, Reddit was another option! Contacted them through discord, and the conversation seemed to go neutral. Oh uh, never mind, a person that unfriended me in the middle of our discussion and due to a mild miscommunication. Rude enough to not even let me finish my thoughts and formulate them properly.  \n\n\nOther than that, people either have terrible grammar to the point I have trouble understanding what the character does or says. Very bland ideas that are impossible to branch out and keep the roleplay alive, or they just suck at collaboration and expect only ME to get the story going.  \n\n\nI know I may sound incredibly picky and pessimistic, but you're talking to a person with 3+ years of experience. I don't know what to do now, I'm just stuck in the middle of quitting roleplay for some time or keeping my hopes up.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am 100% sure there are amazing roleplays out there. But the problem is, I'm not sure if I'm the person of interest for them.  \n\n\n I feel like this endless cycle of hopelessness will continue, and I will have to take a break from roleplay for my own good.",

            "selftext": "I have a pretty amazing roleplay partner who I am very happy with and I have no interest in ending things with him over this, or finding anyone else. But I'm currently frustrated because... I don't know, I guess I'm a baby who can't handle not having everything go 100% my own way.  Our setting contains an alien race with a custom culture and we have two different ideas about what that culture should be like.  The aliens were originally my creation, so it's kind of understood I get the final word on their design, but I'm trying to be a good partner and give him plenty of leeway to shape them and the story how he wants, too.\n\nBut it feels very constraining to me. I have made a lot of concessions that I dislike so that he can add things to their culture that he likes. I shouldn't be patting myself on the back over it, that should just be the way it works when you're writing collaboratively.\n\nBut there are a few things I've asked of him, and he says \"Okay\" and then does the exact opposite.\n\nI told him more than once that I want to retain control over my side characters. He says okay each time but keeps writing their actions anyway.\n\nI told him I'd prefer if we could make our posts shorter during dialogue scenes so we can have some back and forth without letting actions build up too much. He said okay and then kept on writing huge walls of text with his character asking mine multiple questions in one post so our conversations get huge and sloppy. (It's fine if he would've just told me no, he's gonna keep writing the long posts... but why tell me you'll change and then not do it?)  He's a stronger writer than I am so I feel like I have to capitulate to what he wants, because he could just replace me if I become too annoying.\n\nI wanted my aliens to be really different from humans but every time he introduces some new cultural thing for them, it's just copying some aspect of human behavior. I don't know how to say no to him without shooting down all of his ideas and killing his enthusiasm for the RP, so usually I just go with it...\n\nI feel like such an asshole for getting down about this. I don't own this story, half of it is his, too, so I should be more open to what he wants but I'm a control freak and if I'm not getting everything my way I'm unhappy. I ruined my relationship with another great partner by being a control freak and I'm trying so hard not to fuck this one up, too. He's made multiple concessions to my interests already.",

            "selftext": "Okay so my character had a love interest, his name was Aiden. But dear lord, THE ABSOLUTE LACKK OF EFFORT PUT INTO HIM WAS HORRIBLE! He's first described as an \"ugly hot basic white boy\" which is just...\ud83d\udc94 My character never went for men who looked like um...that. But I guess it doesn't matter if shes even attracted to him because that's not a basic part of shipping, like ever. He had basically no persinality at all, often only responding to my character with very dry responses (Ex: Aiden blushed &amp; looked away.) He never made any cute or romantic gestures to show case his interest to her or his own mind/thought process. He just...is there...So far all I know is that he likes my character &amp; is banging her like a feral street dog. Well actually he's banging almost every girl at school like a feral street dog, because he has mommy issues! \n\nOkay, so his mom died when he was young, leading his dad to overwork &amp; become addicted to alcohol, not being able to be with his son most of the time, &amp; on top of that he comes from a poor household that is barely passing by. Ooo, interesting, this must have an affect on him &amp; will help humanize him &amp; make him a character thats worth being invested in, right? Well actually scratch that, because we never see how that influences him at all! What is the point of making this storyline? Literally it can be erased &amp; the only thing that would be different is that he wouldn't be having sex. We know he struggles to make connections with women due to his lack of parental love, so he finds it through girls VIA sex but...We don't explore it! What is the whole point of that set up if thats how it is? \n\nI don't even get a reason WHY he likes my character, my ex rp buddy just says \"He just wants her.\" When I asked what garnered his crush on her. So far, we know he has multiple fuck buddies, probably has a lot of girls into him, &amp; has so many to choose from yet...he chooses my character. Its so anti-climatic. He just likes her for the hell of it despite the previously mentioned! Like dude, if you're getting girls like its nothing then this girl shouldn't be all that special. But she is to you because? Its just insta love with is just one of my biggest pet peeves. \n\nHobbies? Talents? Um...he played...Football? Thats it. He was 6'4 &amp; atheltic so he just plays that. No reason for him to like those things he simply does. Super interesting right? WHAT DOES THIS MAN DO? HE IS SO DRY JESUS CHRIST! All I know is that he spends his time getting tackled by people for some ball, has no parents, &amp; likes sex. What is that?! What am I supposed to work with here? He only has interest in my character since they're fuck buddies &amp; shes pretty. He has no personality, the ship makes no sense, &amp; theres less chemistry since Damon x Elena became canon. \n\nTDLR: dont trust white mem",

            "selftext": "I mean the very obvious answer is sexual gratification, and there are definitely subs and entire RPs where smut is the entire point. No one should be the fun police or anything, so I'm certainly not judging. \n \nI feel like there's two definitions of roleplaying, one in which you \"play a role\" and the other where people are more interested in collaborative writing and exploring a character (or characters). I think like the latter is more common, and that's the kind of RP I like to do. \n\nSo for all those more detailed and descriptive roleplays, there tends to be some people who want to include smut or sexual components to the RP. I used to not write that stuff, but these days I oblige if a partner wants it since it's not really skin off my back (I actually remember one time I said I didn't want to write smut when a partner brought it up, only for them to delete the messages where they asked about it and unfriend me. I'm not quite sure why they did that, and I hope they didn't try to frame me or portray me in a poor light to others lol).\n\nI personally find it boring, and I don't think it really adds more to the characters and a fade to black would suffice (although I guess I can see power exchange and role reversals in the bedroom maybe being a really important aspect of developing characters or something). I've seen more than a few ads state the writer will not skip over sexual scenes, which is perfectly fine as everyone deserves to have their preferences. Does it simply circle back to sexual gratification as to why people want to do this?",

            "selftext": "The absolute state of romance RPs.\n\nThe typical rhythm of romance set-up I've experienced for the past decade is: introduce idea, find common trope/dynamic interests with your partner, introduce characters, RP. Sometimes there's a little mixing, sometimes the ad poster already has a pre-made character and that's all fine and runs on smoothly.\n\nFor the past few months, I've been encountering the same damn roadblock. I reply to someone's post, go through the formalities, and then rather than discussing ideas and elements and/or introducing their pre-made character, they ask *me* for *my* character sheet. #1, I do not keep character sheets, I state so in my info doc. The majority of my characters are made custom for an RP, *also* stated in my info doc. \n\nI repeat this and they, 'yeah, sure, alright, but can you just make a sheet for me really fast?'\n\nWhy? I don't know about your character. I don't know that much about what you're looking for outside of a barebones pitch in your post. If I understand your character and your interests, we can ***build*** together to make something fun for **both** of us, and my character will tailor to compliment yours. Because that's how it works! You talk it out, you figure it out, you make characters fit together. This is a story, you make it natural or you make it phony. It all lies on you and your partner, it's *fiction.* \n\nAnd I always get the same reply! \n\n'My character just might not like yours. I don't want to invest time in an RP I won't keep up with. I want a natural romance.'\n\nBuddy!\n\nPal!\n\nFriendo!\n\nThis is a 1x1 RP. I'm not approaching you out of the blue. You wanted a romance RP, I answer asking what you want from it and how to make it natural, and you shut me down saying no, you want a fun and natural RP. It's not going to happen out of the blue! You have to put in effort and conversation!\n\nIf I just make up a random character, then of course it's not going to work out! A functional, expandable romance is not about personality traits and job and 'likes/dislikes' on a static page. The most interesting character sheet in the world doesn't make a romance. It's about character arcs, where we're starting and where we're ending. It's about character convictions, shared histories, shared interests, shared beliefs, ideas about dynamics and how these two characters impact each other. How do they impact the world? How does the world impact them? These things benefit from writer participation.\n\nWithout it, you're going to end up with a dead RP or a death spiral of 'I love you', 'I love you, too', 'I love you', 'I love you, too', and then whining on here about now no one can write anymore.",
