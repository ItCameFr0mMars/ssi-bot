After tumblr's golden days, I kept afloat with my existing partners -- my two longest RPs have been going on for 7 years now and I didn't really play with anyone outside of my existing RP partners for the past 4-ish years.  \nSadly, one of my RP partners does not have much time for RPing anymore as they got a baby, and my new job allows me more time to shoot a spare message during work hours here and there as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFine, I thought. Would be nice to try something new anyways --- I've wanted to do some Marvel RPs in years, but none of my partners ever were interested in it. And finding some Marvel RPers should be easy, right? Biggest movie franchise ever?  How hard can it be to find someone decent to RP with anyways? \n\nTurns out; Super hard. My old \"hunting grounds\" are useless now, tumblr is dead, omegle is dead, and most of the forums I've been finding do forum/group RPs. I just want some 1-on-1, so I googled around and found this sub recommending discord.   \n\n\nTime to get a discord then. Not gonna lie, slightly confused by discord as a platform, and finding the right servers is much harder than it ought to be. Found a discord-server-tag overview platform, and just joined a couple of them.   \nTurns out; Most of them are server-wide RPs. Fine. I understand the appeal, but it just doesn't fit my interests too much.   \n\n\nFinally found a server for advertising 1-on-1 RPs before. Cool! Wrote a short list of what I'm looking for --- Tumblr style, short description of what I like/dislike, and then a prompt --- aaaaaaaaand got my post deleted. Why? Well, they don't mind AUs in general, but they need to be marvel-centered AUs. Taking the characters into normal slice of life settings is \"pointless\" and they don't want to have any crazier (e.g. traditional fantasy, dark settings like slavery, ABO stuff etc.) AUs either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy? I didn't see anything about that in the rules, but if the server wants to handle this like that, fine! I just... don't get why? Why is it so bad that I just want to explore some characters with someone else? Why do AUs have such a bad rep?  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I remember the crazy tumblr days of Sherlock Holmes being AUed as a tuna and John Watson being a deer, and yeah that was crazy. Sure. But it also was... fun? Plus... \"Character X just started a new job at Character Y's company!\" is just meant to be a cute, fluffy character exploration set-up, not some crazy fish-insanities. Ugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just tired. Any recommendations where I can find some open-to-all fandom-centered RPing add place?  \n\n\nOr maybe I will just wait till my original RP partner's kid will go to school... Six years is nothing, aye?",

I figured I've followed their format to the letter but the mods aren't answering and it's getting increasingly annoying. I think I may end up leaving it. \n\nAnother is where I leave specific prompts at the end of my ad that I am looking for. I'm not really looking for anything outside of what I've listed and people PM me saying that they've got ideas that aren't along the lines of what I'm searching for. I know it is totally okay to ask but why not pick something from my ad that I'm searching for? Isn't that the whole point? It's just a mild annoyance and it's to be expected.",

            "selftext": "I always stayed away from literate roleplayers. Not because I hate people who write a lot- but because I was always scared. I saw ads with many requirements on them and felt like I just couldn\u2019t do it. Until the one day I was contacted by one. I didn\u2019t start the conversation; they did. They asked me to roleplay and directed me to their rules and plot posts. Now- keep in mind, they had intentions for the entire story. And even more so told me they\u2019d probably kill off my characters a lot. Not only did they want exclusively an ANIME photo of my character (despite the fact I had my own drawn references which I had offered), they wanted me to write enough for my message post to reach the \u2018see all\u2019 button. (This was on amino btw)\n\nOn top of that, they expected my character to conform to the world that THEY were controlling but did not give me much information regarding the structure of said world. For example, I had a supernatural character but they refused to tell me how supernaturals are treated or live within their world. (They mentioned supernaturals being oppressed and not allowed to be seen.) Their direct words were \u201cAs if I\u2019d tell you.\u201d \n\nIn this instance it would\u2019ve been hard for me to even figure out what to do to start because I did not want them to correct me on something I had no prior knowledge of (which they actually did quite a few times within the short time we roleplayed). \n\nOver the course of three days I felt like I was stupid. They had something elaborate planned but I wanted basic information to get the plot started, therefore, I asked questions. But they got annoyed very quickly so I tried to proceed with caution. Yet still; they were acting so strange.\n\nAs soon as we started roleplaying they would send me unwarranted ratings of what they thought of my responses. I felt so judged; I felt insecure every time I pressed send, and every time they said it was \u2018OK\u2018 I had to think about what I could\u2019ve done wrong. \n\nBut funnily enough, this partner was making up most of their post through unrelated events and big fancy fonts and borders with emojis all over the place- and while I try not to judge people on their grammar, their grammar was terrible bad. Yet they expected me to write blocks of text that THEY considered to be good or excellent.\n\nThey also threatened to leave during the first day because I didn\u2019t respond fast enough. I\u2019m a student. I have classes. I had it clear in my own rules post- but even so I felt angry because they were being impatient and inconsiderate of the idea I had a life.\n\nThey also killed off my character. The gore scene which left me no room to let my OC react was the most they had written.\n\nLong story short, it was a terrible experience. I haven\u2019t tried to RP with another \u2018literate\u2019 since.\n\nMoral of the story; it\u2019s okay to have preferences and expectations but don\u2019t make people feel like crap as a result of it.",

            "selftext": "Ok. I found someone on reddit who said she was looking for a new RP partner. She listed VERY few preferences and seemed to be one of these \u201cup for new experiences\u201d kind of people. So when I told her I had an idea for Mothership and she said yes, I was ecstatic. Since my last Mothership group fizzled (as groups do at times,) I\u2019ve been sitting on a story I\u2019m dying to play. Sadly, no one seems to be interested even in table top RP groups. We became discord friends and I made a server. She seemed really interested. The idea was I give her all of the materials necessary, show her how to play (Mothership is insanely simple. I could probably teach it in like half an hour) and get the game started within a few days. \n\nWe were going to wait for the weekend. Well in between, we talked. We started to get to know each other a bit more, share pet pics, the usual friend things. Finally, she sits down and looks at the materials After a few days, she sits down and looks at the materials. She sends me a message saying \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this one.\u201d I asked why and she said the gameplay itself was just too intimidating and she didn\u2019t feel that she\u2019d have the time to commit to it. Fine. The gameplay wasn\u2019t the really important part; it was the story. So I asked if she would be ok with us just taking the gameplay out and do the story. She said she\u2019d love that. \n\nSo I was excited this was back on track. We start talking characters. She makes this character that isn\u2019t especially creative, but works well with the story. Besides, I don\u2019t really like a whole ton of backstory in my characters before the game unless it\u2019s something like DnD. I like to get to know the characters as we go along. I told her about a scientist character I had. That\u2019s when she says \u201cOh. Sorry. I only do hetero pairings.\u201d To which I responded \u201cPairings? I didn\u2019t think we were doing a romance roleplay.\u201d We weren\u2019t. This was a strictly horror story from the start. I never deviated from that, I never made her think we were doing romance, nothing of the sort. What\u2019s more, romance wasn\u2019t mentioned even once in her original post. She replies \u201cYeah\u2026. I kind of have to have romance. Sorry.\u201c I wasn\u2019t rude but did tell her \u201cI\u2018m going to need to delete this server if we can\u2019t come up with a workaround.\u201d I don\u2019t see that as problematic. I can\u2019t have a dead server taking up space in my Discord. \n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, this isn\u2019t a huge deal. And frankly, I\u2018ve roleplayed with worse. But am I wrong for being kind of pissed? Like she didn\u2019t discuss any prefs whatsoever. Never even said the word \u2018romance.\u2018 I feel like these things should have been discussed before servers were made and stories were written. Not only that, I feel like she just kind of randomly assumed that\u2019s what we were doing, even though I made sure to explain this was sci-fi/horror.",

            "selftext": "I met this partner maybe in the past month and while the plotting was maybe average at best it didn't really feel like they wanted to invest much into the overall plot or modify it to suit us both better... I wanted to see if it would get better though since sometimes you get a flow and then it gets good.  My first flag for it going to be an awkward rp was that in my gdoc search thread I wrote an intro for a plot... There was my  characters part and then a male intro just to set the tone. It wasn't to be used for the partner but just to kind of show the sort of idea I was going for dynamic wise as an example. Their intro they wrote 75% themselves but then literally copied and pasted my own words into their post for their 'first impressions' for the last paragraph and a half. Literally they see each other for the first time and they just regurgitated everything I wrote for that whole thought process.  I asked them about it and they said they 'wouldn't do it again' and made no effort to even edit it which already left a bad taste..\n\nI'd also sometimes have our roleplay gdocs open and they might happen to be working on a post and specific details about certain things we established they'd be mucking up. I guess I'll make an example, lets say you have a specific look for your character or an outfit for a scene, lets pretend they're a brunette wearing all blues and greens and you're literally talking about it in ooc. Their post makes them blonde wearing reds and yellows despite going over the references earlier on...I literally had to talk to them about it..they fixed it...then they made the same comment about the character later with a whole other scene. Or if you had it clearly started that your character had bright blue eyes and they repeatedly said they had deep brown ones or another color..neither is what they did but they're incredibly close examples.\n\nThe characters also don't entirely gel very much, they're not terrible writers but how they write is very immersion breaking. It's medieval fantasy and they're mentioning bullets in comparisons to speed despite us being clear about firearms not existing and chain-link fences and other way too modern of items. Also the way they're writing their character for as young as they've made them for their species is just incredibly overpowered in a way that I don't think will be able to have character development in any way shape or form... They've done so much for their species, savior and protector of this that and the other while probably barely being an 'adult' by their standards.. Their character also is written at least to me a little oddly...Mood changes that would would startle or unsettle anyone reading it because there's no flow to it with how jarring it can be. \n\nMy replies have gotten slower and slower because as the writing goes on it's become awkward and unenjoyable.\n\nI honestly usually get ghosted, more often because people get busy because of a hiatus or something and never usually am the one that feels like I want to end things..What's the best way to approach this and end the rp? I don't want to hurt their feelings and don't mind if they still want to talk but I need to be clear =/",

I've thought about what I can do, what I can change and on this one I focused to remove 2 things:\n\n1) Abuse on sidekick character.\n2) Mary Sue Syndrome.\n3) Grammer and typos.\n\nSo here you go! If you find any more errors please share, I really appreciate a good criticism on this prompt because I want to actually play it damnit! Enjoy:\n\n**Injustice For All:** The prompt includes 2 characters. Your character who's been working as a sidekick for a man/woman and both are superheroes in a city. The issue is from outside they may seem like an excellent duo who's completing each other and striking against villains but the harsh reality is everything is not what it seems. Your character doesn't agree with what heroes and especially the hero they're the sidekick of doing. Maybe to them, maybe to people, maybe they think heroes aren't so good as people think. I'm trying to keep it vague so you can fill it as you wish! \n\nThe wheel of fate makes your character and Rosalina encounter each other. On opposite sides... for now. \n\nMy character will be named Rosalina. She's 175, 30 years old, and has an hourglass-shaped body. She has long blonde hair and yellow eyes with plump lips. She's mostly frowning or has a serious face around people. Half of her face is covered with her blonde hair as well. Her right eye and some part of her cheek is covered with her blonde hair. But the rest of her face is visible. She has the power to bend elements at her will. She's a friendly person with her close ones but due to her aims her life here she has to keep a serious pose against her opponents and so called heroes. She hates the system, politicians, taxes, and especially... (you guessed it!) heroes. Her biggest dream is to have the most powerful mafia group called \"Injustice For All\". But sadly she isn't too resourceful. She's alone in her case, sometimes getting help from other mafia groups, helping them in return. But she've yet to find someone who sees the world as she does. \n\nUntil your character and she meets up. At first, they'll be enemies since heroes hate the mafia and Rosalina hates heroes. But later they realize they can come to an agreement, maybe even a friendship to shape the city in their hands together!",

            "selftext": "My partner and I recently launched a secondary concept server. Unlike the main one we've been running for a few years now, this one is for players 25+ mostly, but we do allow for players 18-24 *if* they've been referred by an active member.   \n\n\n The main reason for the age clause is that we wanted this place to be less time-consuming and more just relaxed story-telling. In our main, we're very used to holding the hands of new players, running their first few scenes with them to help get their feet wet. In this secondary concept, we can help start scenes for new players, but we also expect that, as adults, everyone involved will more or less know how to set themselves up or at the very least, to communicate if they need help.   \n\n\nWe launched it about a month ago, and it's been chill. A few minor hiccups, but overall, it's a good vibe.   \n\n\nSo we got this guy maybe 2 weeks ago. Right off the bat, I clicked with them. Their character was one that featured a lot of elements of my hometown. It turns out that we're from the same area. It was really nice having someone I could relate to like that. And being that we're close to the same age, we also got a lot of each other's jokes featuring millennial pop-culture references. It was so fun. We'd chat until the early hours. I approved his character through the first two levels of the application that night while my partner was asleep.   \n\n\n(For some context, our application process is something new I've not seen anywhere. It goes in 3 parts adapted to ensure that by the time someone's in play, they're not just going to dip out with the old easy-come-easy-go and waste another player's time. The actual application is step one, where the character is interviewed to come onto the new planet. Step 2 is a solo scene that combines a writing sample with a verification that the lore is understood. Step 3 is an intro scene that serves to familiarize players with the setting while also verifying their activity. It sounds like a lot because it is. That's intentional. People who just want something quick and easy without engaging with other writers don't make it past step 2. The benefit is that once you're in, you know everyone else has had to put in the same amount of time to get there as you did, so you're less likely to be left high and dry).   \n\n\nThe third step is something only my partner can do in play, but I can approve steps 1&amp;2. This guy worked fast, he had minor edits in his solo scene. I got him set up for step 3 within the night of him coming into the server. Well-written concept, great attitude, super friendly, very active - I had high hopes.   \n\n\nThe first red flag was really more of a yellow, maybe an orange flag. His Step 3 intro scene was paired with another applicant who could only post once every 2-3 days, while he was able to write multiple times a day. He got halfway through the scene before he told my partner that he didn't think it was fair he had to wait on someone else when he was ready to graduate into play. I worried about how it would make the other player feel, but I do understand how much it can suck when you're available and wanting to write more, but you're held back by someone who isn't as fast as you. So we approved him, got him started up, hoozah.   \n\n\nTwo days later, he's jumped into another person's scene that's not marked as open. I know not everyone does this, but I personally don't feel it's polite to just join a scene unless you know the person who started it wants anyone and everyone popping by. Sometimes, people start scenes in public channels intending to just write with 1-2 other people, and that's okay. It takes nothing to reach out in DMs and *ask* \"hey would you mind if my character stops by.\"   \n\n\nAgain, I know not everyone plays like that, so I just posted something like \"hey we love the enthusiasm, but please make sure you ask first just in case.\" There were other channels open, either without scenes happening at all, or with actively marked open scenes, meaning anyone could pop in. He waited another day for someone in that scene to post, and when no one did - he ended the scene and started his own.   \n\n\nThis is where things get mucky. Idk about everyone else, but that feels incredibly rude to me. Our activity requirement is 1 post per week. The people in that scene had not yet lapsed a week. Even if they had, it's up to the *mods* to poke for activity, not other players. It had been 2 days in that channel since the last post for that scene, which meant it was nowhere near needing to be reset. Without asking the people in the scene if they were cool with him closing them out and starting something new, without asking the server staff if he could, he just did it. I have to say it again: it feels so incredibly RUDE.   \n\n\nLike, if I didn't feel like writing for two days, would he just help himself to ending my scenes too?   \n\n\nSo, because this had already caused a bunch of confusion, we reached out to everyone who had been in the original scene. Told the first two \"mark your scenes as open if you want people joining to minimize confusion, we're sorry for the slips here.\" Told the third who'd just joined without an invitation \"if it's not marked as open, ask first please.\" And to this guy, we actually reprimanded him, saying that while we totally get that he wants to be active, we had to reset the channel because the whole thing had just gotten out of hand and we don't want people thinking this is how they should be writing, and for the future - if it's not his scene, not to end it just because he wants to use the channel, not fair to other writers, yada yada.   \n\n\nThis guy went from chatting all day every day to not saying a peep. We know he's online because he's in other hubs with us, but he's listing himself as offline and has been doing so since.   \n\n\nI'm torn. Part of me feels like, with this context, he's just not considerate of his fellow writers and he's sort of petty. Silent treatment over a minor correction, wherein he was told he's allowed to copy and paste his scene introduction after the reset but he's not staff so he's not allowed to end other people's scenes. Just feels a little immature. Or was I way out of line and I shouldn't have thought twice about him ending the scene because ultimately he was trying to bring more activity to the server?",

Not just because of the overall quality of the writing, but also because there are a lot of posts that are just really... disturbing and I still wish I didn't know half the stuff I learned about on that app. Anyway, thing is, by now I'm so used to seeing all types of shit (I'm pretty convinced one in... five? posts on there is from a pedophile--and I'm not talking about ageplay) that I'm desensitized to it so I usually no longer feel the need to vent about anything. \n\n\nThat and I learned both how to read what type of roleplayer someone is within the first few messages exchanged *and* how to make my posts intimidating/intense/snobby enough that I never get hit up anymore by one-liners and the likes. So now for me it's more a matter of turning someone down because we don't vibe and not because there's anything really wrong with their writing.\n \n\nStill, it's fun to lurk around here and I'm happy that people that still have the energy to vent (look at me talking like a 80 y.o.) have a place to do so. It's also mindblowing to me that roleplayers in the community actually talk to each other and know each other and sometimes warn each other about other roleplayers. But I've always been somewhat of an outsider so I shouldn't be surprised I missed that's a thing! \n\n\nYeah, that's all I had to say. Fancy meeting y'all and happy roleplaying!",

            "selftext": "I'm more just exasperated than anything, but I figured I'd vent my frustration here, cuz why not? It's what it's here for.\n\nI had done a search on a few roleplaying forums lately for anything in a Gothic/dark fantasy vein, since it's a genre I've been craving for a while. I found an ad that someone had posted a couple months ago, but sent them a message anyway in case they were still looking for partners. They messaged me back eventually and said they were open to chatting, so we exchanged Discord handles and I reached out to them to brainstorm potential plot ideas.\n\nThey said they had a world already figured out, inspired by such games as Ravenloft, Innistrad, and darkest dungeons. Although I wasn't familiar with the latter two, a little Googling told me they'd be right up my alley, so I asked them a bit more about the world and/or characters they had in mind.\n\nWe exchanged a few messages, I mentioned I was comfy playing either a male or female role, depending on what my partner preferred, and that I tailor each character to whatever storyline I'm hammering out with a partner. I added that I like to have the option of some sort of romance/tension thrown in, but I'm fine with slow burns and letting it happen organically.\n\nThey said they wanted the storyline to revolve around a vampire family, and I was like, oh, cool, I've been wanting to play a manipulative, sinister femme fatale type for a while. Maybe she could fit? \n\nThey were like, yeah, that sounds close to the matriarch character they wanted to play. Which confused me a little, so I asked if that was a role *they* wanted, or if there were other roles in the family a partner could take on?\n\nNope, apparently they wanted to play *all* the roles in the vampire family. The matriarch plus all her children.\n\nOh. Well, okay, that kinda limits the potential for interaction, but whatever. I expressed that I was finding it was a bit challenging to wedge in a character without more detail, but that maybe I could play some sort of enemy for this vampire family. I mentioned again that I tailor my characters to suit, but perhaps I could play some sort of cursed werewolf/shapeshifter type as a foil for these vampires. \n\nNo response. So I pitch another idea, only to find out that they've blocked me.\n\nWell, sheesh. I didn't think this partnership was going to work out anyway, since it was a bit like pulling teeth to get any details from them about what they had in mind, but *really*? Straight to the blocking, huh?\n\nI'm mostly annoyed cuz it feels like getting pre-emptively dumped before you're even sure you want to go out with a person. They just beat me to the punch.\n\nOh well. Good luck playing all those roles yourself! Maybe just write a story while your'e at it and take this whole \"partnership\" idea out of the equation.\n\nBut lesson learned. Any time someone says they've got a whole world in mind, it probably just means what they really want is to work on a solo project and they're just looking for someone to egg them along.",

            "selftext": "Everyone here generally knows what makes up a bad RPer. So, to cultivate a world of Good RPers, what are lesser known rules/traits that you believe make up a good RP partner?\n\nI. **Respectful of your OOC Obligations**\n\nReason \u2014 RP is a hobby that comes secondary to issues that arise in real life (job/family/health). As long as you give notice that you\u2019ll be busy or need a hiatus for whatever reason, a good RP partner should/will be understanding and supportive of you being away.\n\nHowever, this does not mean they are obligated to wait for your return to continue the story. Being a Good RPer also means understanding that your partner is free to pick up another story/partner instead if you are unable to meet their story needs due to time constraints.\n\nII. **No Pressure**\n\nReason \u2014 a Good RPer will not hound you for a reply (a poke every 3-7 days is reasonable depending on whether you do rapid fire or weekly replies, not hourly). Nor will they try to pressure you to write a scene or topic (ERP) you are not comfortable with.\n\nAnd a controversial one\u2026\n\nIII. **Post order for replies:**\n*First to reply, first to get a response.*\n\nReason\u2014 Fairness. \u201cReplying with the muse\u201d will only leave your other partners (who go without a timely reply) feeling left out or as if your story doesn\u2019t matter as much to them.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d want any of my partners to feel is that they need to compete for my attention. Each storyline I write with my partners is equally amazing and irreplaceable and they should never question that.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what the community has to say. As a mod on Discord, I\u2019d like to eventually compile this thread into a reference sheet. Please follow the format:\n\n**Unspoken Rule**\nReason \u2014",

Our mafia RP world was developed and so well put together that honestly, I was so proud of it. \n\nhowever one day, I'm noticed that he was replying less frequent than what im usually normal to but i didn\u2019t freak out because i understand that a person is busy with life i get that. so then the next day we roleplaying normally like we always do in the mornig. i sent him a reply. 10 minutes pass\u2026.      20 minutes pass\u2026..  1 hour pass\u2026\u2026.         3 hours pass by \u2026.. so now im thinking let me go check whats up becuase this is really werid coming from him.\n\n\nand guess what? \n\n\nHE BLOCKED ME\u2026.OUT OF NOWHERE. I don't get how can people block their roleplay partners after developing so much time and effort into the world we created which was mafia forbidden love\u2026 where two loves meet in a masquerade ball and fall for each other but once they find out their families are enemies to one and other, it gets complicated. it was such a perfect story and it's now completely gone.",

They just started to slow down, until eventually he said he needed a break. We\u2019ve been on a break since 10/22/2021, which yes I know sounds like a very long time. But we\u2019ve been speaking out of character since that time, just sort of bonding and getting to know each other.\n\nI was sort of just in shock that he hasn\u2019t ghosted me yet, and we just recently decided that whenever we\u2019re free we would send a continuation of our roleplay, and we\u2019ve been doing that a few random times. It\u2019s been about a week since he last sent a roleplay response, however we talk every day OOC. \n\nIs there any way I can sort of politely ask if he would like to continue?

            "selftext": "I just discovered this sub (where has this been all my life), and I really thought a lot about posting these stories because on a surface level they\u2019re just so... petty? Silly? But at the same time, the incidents in question still affect me mentally so might as well vent on a sub that could understand instead of forcing myself to live with this forever!\n\nIncident 1:\n\nI rped a lot with this one person, who I\u2019ll call \u201cSam.\u201d I adored their character, their writing, and I just loved talking OOC with them too. We became really good friends and eventually we agreed to have our characters enter a relationship because they had so much chemistry and we had fun rping together. I was beyond excited. \n\nAround this time though, I was taking a lot of extracurriculars and joined a sport, which obviously cut into my rping time. On top of that, Sam was in a time zone three hours ahead, so when I did get a chance to finally come on they were asleep. It was disappointing but I understood. \n\nBut then one day I logged on and scrolled through the dash and saw that their character had gotten together with another one. The kicker was that my character was decently popular in canon, so there were lots of people playing as them (a lot of us actually knew each other and were friends lol), and the character that Sam\u2019s hooked up with was literally mine played by a different person. I didn\u2019t know what to say; I just went to sleep hurt and feeling guilty about being hurt over something so petty. Eventually I did ask what happened to our plans, and Sam said I just wasn\u2019t on enough. I don\u2019t know why but that stung, even though I knew they had a point.\n\nIncident 2:\n\nThis happened a lot later, but Sam eventually made an account for a different character. Sam had a lot of other accounts but the thing is, they followed me on every single one except this new one. In hindsight I should\u2019ve seen this as a sign and stayed away, but I was a stupid teenager and loved all of Sam\u2019s characters and writing.\n\nI followed the new account and, surprisingly, they actually started rping with me. Then after a couple of interactions, Sam messaged me OOC and said something along the lines of \u201cHey OP, I\u2019d prefer it if you unfollowed me.\u201d I said sure of course, but again I was a stupid teen who kept pushing and asked why, and they said \u201cI actually made this account to get away from you.\u201d\n\nThat stung a lot. After that they said that they liked me as a friend but they didn\u2019t like getting their hopes up when I wasn\u2019t on when they were. But honestly idk, it kind of hurt a lot more than I expected, especially since I just. Couldn\u2019t understand why me not being on 24/7 could affect our relationship both in rp and OOC? Maybe there was a lot more to it I didn\u2019t understand but from then on, even when I rped in other fandoms and websites I barely spoke/posted OOC just because I was afraid I\u2019d come on too strong; I\u2019m only just now realizing it\u2019s because of what happened when I was a wee teen \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nIf anybody read this, thank you. I\u2019ve been rping for a long ass time now so I definitely have other horrid memories but this just happened to be the one I\u2019ve been too embarrassed of to tell people haha.",

But my God, the larger amount of us are some fucking incredible people. \n\nWe RPers can create fantasies, big and small, out of nothing. Movies, books, series, our own experiences. A pintetest aesthetic board, a tiktok, a music video. We can make entire kingdoms from the slightest inspiration. College romance stories from the abyss. From cyberpunk, to steampunk, dieselpunk. From fandom worlds to totally original ideas, we are creators of some of the most beautiful fantasies. But, we ourselves don't live in a fantasy. We live in a fucking bitter reality sometimes. That's why I'm making this post. Because at the end of the day, despite all we do, despite how brilliant and better then this world our fantasies can be, we all still yield to reality. Life is inescapable for us all. So, every once in a while, check on your rp partners. Ask how they're doing or simply thank them for creating such beautiful worlds with you. We are all incredible people who do incredible things with our minds and a keyboard. Treasure each other because our brilliant minds won't last for ever. \n\nDespite my grievances, I fucking love every single one of you creative bastards.",

We don't write NSFW, it's very casual, and we've only really gotten a few posts in, much to my chagrin. But hey, finals, life can be like that, so no biggie.  \nI'm pan, she's a lesbian. (I don't think she knows I'm pan? i haven't said it, but she's open about her sexuality.) Ocassionally, we message ooc to say hi, say how our day was, etc.  \n\n\nTonight, she sent me this message: 'A cute girl pulled my hair so now I may need new underwear' with a laughing crying emoji.  \nI really don't like comments like that. I'm also on the asexual spectrum, kinda grey/demi sexual, so I guess maybe I'm biased, but it grossed me out. I wondered if I was being prejudiced and asked myself if a guy said this, would I feel the same? Honestly, yeah, if a guy told me that sentence, I'd probably be even MORE disgusted, if anything, because of how men in my own life have objectified women.   \n\n\nPoint is: I really didn't want to receive a sentence like that out of the blue and it grossed me out. But if I tell this person not to send that to me, I'm worried about being called homophobic. Am I? Is this appropriate to share with an rp partner? Would any of you send this to an rp partner out of the blue?",
