I have noticed an alarming amount of weirdos slapping the term \"taboo\" onto their plot ideas when in reality it's just pedophilia. It feels like there's been a huge influx of people using the term \"taboo\" as a security blanket within the RP community. \n\nBasically what I'm saying is the number of people trying to cover up their pedophilia-filled plot idea as just a kink is alarming. It's just sad to me how much I see it in different posts and yet mods don't take it down... yet I throw a few f-bombs in my post and suddenly it's taken down for \"excess swearing.\" Meanwhile, Gary over here is requesting his roleplay partner play as a ten-year-old in a relationship with a 30+ year-old teacher. They get away with it so now normalized to the point where I can't even politely decline a plot at times without being accused of something bizarre like kink-shaming.",

            "selftext": "We see it constantly here and probably in our own searches. The idea that someone is obligated to write with someone else.\n\nFrom differences in writing styles, to preferred genres, to characters, etc.\n\nWhen someone says you are not who they are looking for, move on. It's such a simple concept, yet so many people fail to understand it. I even see it from the rejected time to time.\n\nThis, of course, swings both ways. What you may feel means one thing and another does not, just don't write with those people.\n\nThe current upset I see continuously as of late: adv. lit, novella, lit and so on.\n\n\"Adv. lit. to me means they have an advanced understanding of the language in which I write in.\"\n\n\"Adv. Lit to me means they are able to write several paragraphs and have a strong grasp of the language in which I write in.\"\n\n\"That is too much, it becomes a problem. Filling up with flowery pose is fucking stupid. You're a fucking idiot for thinking that means adv. lit. and I will attack you even though we are not writing together over your preferred way of writing.\"\n\n\"I hope your crops wither and your animals are barren if you don't write how I prefer at any given time.\"\n\nStop. Just don't write with these people. Just don't. You are not compatible. Move on. Your rage over these issues shows a flaw in you as a writing partner. This is far more worrying as a collaborative writer than how much or how well you may write.\n\nWhen someone says no, they can for any reason. You aren't even writing together yet. It is the cursory movement of meeting a partner.\n\nThere also seems to be a failure to understand how things work on *your* website(s) of choice mean nothing to how it works on others. The site I began to actually learn to role play and make it an actual hobby does not always line up with places like, say, Reddit.\n\nAdv. lit. on the site I use predominantly means multipara. Novella also falls under this catagory but isn't used as often. So, when *I* see adv. lit. it is how I personally understand it to be.\n\nAdv. lit. for some means just an advanced grasp on the language.\n\nI personally find this to be a bit lacking. A paragraph with a bunch of large words, for me, is no different than extra flourishes that mean absolutely nothing to the post being handed off to me. Where as several paragraphs of thoughts, feelings, building the world before that character means a lot more.\n\nThis means *I* am incompatible with certain writers and certain writers are incompatible with *me*.\n\n**And that is okay**.\n\nI get it. Sometimes it is hard to find partners. Sometimes you may go through an incredible dry spell where it seems you are turning away or being turned away by a heap of potential partners. But, it is what it is. Why would you want to waste time or write in a way you aren't comfortable with. Or, even worse, attempt to force someone to write in a way they are not comfortable with?\n\nThere are many, *many* different types of writers out there. Not all of them will be compatible. Does it suck? Definitely. I've been there. You've been there. We have all *been there*.\n\nI really love typing up long paragraphs and I love receiving them in return. I like knowing how another character is feeling, what their thoughts are, how they are seeing the world around them. I like hefty sections of dialogue. I love seeing someone's work on display and I love sharing my own. I love discussing with partners what those feelings mean or where they may lead. I love watching a character work through an inner monologue or thought process and see how it turns out based on responses from other characters.\n\nCertainly, sometimes a paragraph or two works. You don't always need to have the same thoughts play over and over again.\n\nSometimes people don't want that because if their character can't see them why should they? Or if they know a character is facing a certain thought process they will purposely change their characters movements or thoughts in turn because they cannot or won't seperate the controller from the character. That's you and that's fine.\n\nBut it isn't how everyone is.\n\nAnd because of that. No one owes you a story. No one owes you their time or partnership. They are allowed to say \"**no, that is not what I am looking for**\".\n\nStop guilting, stop raging, stop throwing tantrums and fits. Stop demanding anything from anyone then acting surprised when you are turned away, blocked or ghosted. Stop demanding that it is your way and only your way to people who aren't even writing with you.\n\nNot every writer is the same and it's ridiculous how many people seem to think this should be the case. The collaborative writing world is vast, full of different people into different things, different abilities and different wants and needs. Your people are out there, you just have to find them. You won't manage this by attempting to force other people into your box.",

            "selftext": "Man... It really kills my roleplay spirit sometimes. I'd been writing with this person since February this year; the story was quite interesting. Suddenly, the activity goes out and they let me know they have a lot going on. A requirement of mine stated in my 'search posts' is that I ask for communication. Even if someone is no longer interested; just tell me so we can part in good ways. I was happy they were letting me know they had something going on. Nothing, for about a month then. I messaged twice; just small messages asking if they were okay. Eventually, last week; I sent a longer message telling them I was getting a bit worried about them, but also that I would appreciate some clarification on whether or not we'd continue the story. Rather than a respectful reply; they just left the server.\n\nI know it's common, but it does suck when you've been writing for such a long time. I know it's not easy to let someone know you're no longer interested; but why reach out to someone who specifically asks for communication and who isn't ghost-friendly when you know you are incapable of bringing up an issue, or simply stating you're no longer interested in writing? I wish people could be honest with themselves in that regard. I know ghosting is common, I know its not personal most of the time, but it always leaves you wondering what you did wrong.",

We must habe the sex now for the rest of the rp then complain when we get bored of it.\"\n\n\nLike I can't fathom the thought process. I want an equal balance of horniness and plot driven roleplaying, not just people sexting one another without caring. It's so infuriating when I join or make a group erp then a couple people are like: \"Plot? Character consistency? What's that?\"\n\nOne stark example would be when I was part in of an rp centered around one depraved character(Jesse) blackmailing a pair of characters that were meant to be innocent and pure(Rose and Hannah). There would be other characters involved, and I was a side character, but I literally didn't get to do anything because as soon as the blackmailing portion started, the person playing Hannah did a complete 180 on their character and started to just have them be super kinky and into everything that was happening to their character, when *quite fucking literally* 3 responses ago their character was \"shaking uncontrollably, uncomfortable and scared of the place they were in\"\n\nI don't know how to deal with this kind of thing, if any of you have had any successful group erps, I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know how to find a better way of dealing with these kinds of people who just horny post for a couple days (if even that) then leave.",

            "selftext": "**Alt title: plz read what you get sent**\n\nLast week, I messaged someone who mentioned having a scifi idea in the shout box, but they were vague about it.  They explained the idea in private, and the pairing/plot didn't interest me. I explained as much, and went on my merry way.  The way the site is set up is that you can leave conversations, but if the other person stays in, the conversation will pop up again if they message you.\n\nWell, they messaged me last night asking if I wanted to roleplay, I said sure and asked about preferred genres to get an idea of what to suggest. They told me and then they asked about the plot I'd turned down last week, ok, whatever. Maybe they didn't scroll up and forgot I'd said no. They then realized that I'd said 'no' previously and asked if there were any plots I were interested in. Boy howdy, do I! I tossed them some quick scifi plot write ups plus a character that'd go with them. All very loose ideas with plenty of wiggle room for development.\n\nThere were some questions about my character, which I answered. Then they brought up another character that they were interested in. I declined and explained \"\\[character\\] is really popular and since I have so many RPs with that one, I'd rather use one of my lesser used characters.\" This character has a nickname that's listed on the sheet, and I tend to use that one because the actual name is long and a pain to type out. Person had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nHm. Might be a red flag? I explained the nickname and all was good.\n\nThen, they admitted they were having trouble thinking up scifi plots, which just made me glance at the four plots I'd suggested 15 minutes earlier. More character questions and answers, including me suggesting additional scenarios/plot ideas with zero input from them on what sounded interesting. Ultimately, they asked if I had other characters I'd be interested in playing. I suggested another character who I don't get to write very much, which prompted them to suggest an idea that they admitted wouldn't work with either of the characters I suggested and was of a genre I hadn't expressed interest in. Sorry, but with the current state of things, I'm *really* not interested in something apocalyptic.\n\nAt this point, I got the gist that they were only fishing for people who were interested in their plots and politely bowed out, citing that we probably wouldn't be compatible writers.",

            "selftext": "So. I am not saying that what happened here makes them a bad role player, or they didn't have a right to end it, but I would like to share my experience with this controlling player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind someone on Reddit. Send a writing sample. We brainstorm on a plot thread we had in common. Went well, but I immediately got vibes about how much of a great role player they were and a master of the written word, and an AoL expert. Here's what happened from the very start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Sent an option of ten face claims and they only reluctantly agreed to choosing one out of ten. They did not ask my approval nor care what FC I preferred, nor did I have a say in the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Gave a bunch of different character ideas and all of them were shot down. Eventually, we agreed on a very trope boring generic idea that sounded appealing to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. So the side characters... Boy oh boy. They made five NPCs a thousand words of lore and created an entire server for what I was willing to help do. So essentially, they took full creative control of the character they were playing, the setting we were playing in, and 90% of my character, and all the npcs. I tried to help with all this, but they didn't ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Now I'm dumb, and their writing was decent, so I was like, \"okay they did all this effort. Let's do the writing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. So I wrote a little. They were in control of the setting of the scene, constantly made NPCs interrupt the scene, and suggested I was stupid because I asked why we were using phone calls as a starter instead of you know starting the characters in the same hemisphere. This was the first time I disagreed with them and their response was \"LOL AOL DID IT DONT YOU KID KNOW ANY BETTER?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Anytime I asked or brainstormed about a character's response or what course they would like to see the RP go, they said \"This isn't collaborative writing\". Basically, they expected something very specific but didn't want to talk OOC about it at all. Fight me. Roleplay is collaborative writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Another interesting tangent here. They wanted to play my character's romantic rival but when he had an interest in others that's when they started having problems.   \n\n\n So we reached a point where my character did something they didn't like (during the pursuit of her main character's romantic rivals) The complaint was immaturity because he didn't fawn over her main character endlessly. I offer to course correct the RP because it was literally one edit of a post that upset them. They didn't like my character but will keep writing because you know... it's not collaborative writing. They were extremely complimentary about my writing and excited about the characters until this point. Ended after I argued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoleplay is collaborative writing! Stories are fun with the contribution of both players! Don't make your partner guess what you want and then be upset when they don't do it!!!! Don't be pretentious!!!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR people are not your tools and roleplay is collaborative writing. Venting.",

A few posts in, I'm already struggling to write replies because his character briefly reacts to mine, doesn't wait for an answer- the post states that- then spends a majority of it rushing to a separate location, interacting with NPCs, and ending the scene. This becomes a pattern in our RPs sometimes. For our latest post, I asked if he wanted my character to meet with his and he said yes, but I should write in a skip to the next day before I do.\n\nSometimes it feels like we're rushing the scenes and I wish mine had more time to react to the ongoing situation. To be fair though, my character was freaking out and prompting for action at the other location, but I had assumed we'd at least have them travel there together. Is this a fair thing to struggle with, or am I being too picky?",

Spring a trap that weakens her, pull out the Bersarkr Staff and get ready for a brawl. It was time to go\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, totally uninvited, three more people barrel in, proceed to completely ignore the trap I sprung, and just dogpile the woman while a fourth whines in edgelord and rips a part of her soul out when all she had to do was just move twenty foot to be outside the exclusion zone that had been set up. I am muscled out of my own thread and just have to watch as it all resolves itself without my imput. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then when I mention that civilian casulties are basically null because the town was drilled to take cover in the event of an attack, the buildings are reinforced \\*and\\* the trap cut off the acid rain before it could fall on the city properly...they get super mad for me ruining the the thread and that hundreds of people should of died and fuck they hate that thread now (repeat, a thread they barrelled into, uninvited and without reason)",

            "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all, 23 rper here. I\u2019ve been trying to get back into Rp lately, but let me give some brief context.\n\nI roleplay on Tumblr primarily ( yes, I know, please save your grievances on this I KNOW ), and I have been since I was a teen. Around when I turned 21 I realized I had a very unhealthy relationship with Tumblr RP and the culture it had, that at one point I had a massive breakdown over something so small in hindsight. Especially when the pandemic started the unhealthyness just really been kicked up a notch, and fell into less than pleasant dynamics. This year I\u2019ve pretty much been MIA from tumblr rp, it isn\u2019t until around last month I\u2019ve been getting back into it part time.\n\nI\u2019ve had some wonderful experiences and RP, but man\u2026 does me coming back made me realize why I partly left.\n\nPeople can\u2019t plot for shit. I made it clear and bold in my rules that I don\u2019t do \u201cwinging it\u201d threads as often as I used to, and that there has to be SOME kind of point. Mundane talk gets stale really fucking fast. Countless times I\u2019ve said that it takes two to tango, and that I refuse to do all the heavy lifting / engage in RP if you\u2019re not doing your side of the plotting before. I\u2019ve been tremendously left down semi recently because I\u2019ve liked someone\u2019s plotting call and was excited to get something going, only for them to hit me with the \u201csrry I\u2019m bad at plotting, but I like this\u201d, like, man, fuck off. I even asked if there\u2019s anything they\u2019d like to see their muse do and what my muse has to offer for them and I just kept being hit with the \u201cidk whatever works\u201d. \n\nEven coming back it\u2019s interactions like that that\u2019s just\u2026 been making tumblr RP worth it. Reaching out to people don\u2019t really feel as fun as they used to let alone fulfilling, like fucking hell I get it I have anxiety too but can y\u2019all put effort in your writing for ONE moment? \n\nI have a lot of HC\u2019s I want to write / queue up but I\u2019ve just been like \u201cman what\u2019s even the point.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve tried to branch out to other communities, but It\u2019s been around the same feeling.\n\nIt\u2019s just so disappointing\u2026.",

            "selftext": "I haven't done a strong rp in a long long time. Frankly I've lost all motivation for it. I like world building but I've been turned off to allowing people to rp in it.\n\nI give an idea and a plot. Sometimes I'll list a series of them and add a goal like \"This event is the start to this character's self doubt\". They (my partners) would do the same. And we pick what to rp for the day or week any roll with it.\n\nBut the one person who has cause me a lot of grief to say the least... Outside of attempting to find countless ways to get some sexual action from majority of my male characters, she'd shoehorn her character into being the main character in plots that were meant to tell the story of the group. Her character would always have some sort of upper hand over everyone else or always come up to be a hero of the plot.\n\nI wouldn't oppose it if we had discussed it prior or if it was a plot that was meant for her development. But when it's something like exploring the dynamics of our characters' interactions or challenging them, it's suddenly Mary Sue time (and I really hate using that term but it fits). She's the key to resolving everything wrong despite how many moving parts there are.\n\nWhile she's gone now and I still talk to my current partner (he's cool and a good bean), I just don't have it in me anymore. I don't want my characters to be puppeted by someone else to propel plot or blindside me by taking it into another direction that doves everyone else under the rug.\n\nAnd I feel petty and guilty for thinking that way. I make the effort to be fair. I don't just plot for my characters, I'll plot for others too but I'd also tell them and give them room to exercise their imaginations too. I'll give the material but they can choose what they make with it. I don't ever want to shit on someone else's creativity but it was so infuriating at times and it would leave me feeling used.\n\nSo I don't know. I want to keep my stories going but I don't want to put that energy into rping again I miss it though.",

I am fine when someone doesn't understand how to use commas, make misspelling, some grammar errors and such but I do have issues with not understanding how to format your writing or dialogue. \n\nI feel these are the most simplistic things in RP to fix because the rules are simple, can be easily fixed.  It's not hard.   I've come across this six or seven times now where I have to explain it or offer a website.  People get so agitated because they want to write the way they want, but no one tells them they need to fix this writing.  No one is perfect, but damn, I feel like shit when I have to say something because I loved the RPs I was doing with them but not enough to deal with the several individuals who either blocked me or ghosted me because they needed to understand dialogue. \n\nI will probably have to start asking for a post sample before I even get to RPing with them, just to see if they get it.  I don't like doing that because it feels so elitst and I'm not, I'm asking you to understand dialogue and format.  I literally look over everything else.",

Especially when you NOW know how you could of said it, but it\u2019s way too late because the other person of course had already read it or it\u2019s so old that no one would notice.\nAnd like, I know this is stuff that my partners probably never noticed or simply didn\u2019t think it was anything worth mentioning , but I KNOW and that\u2019s the problem \ud83e\udd23.\nPlus the paranoia that my partners DID see the mistakes or find it cringey or are secretly judging me for it is KILLING ME HELP AHHHHH",

            "selftext": "3 months ago I joined an up-and-coming role play server on discord, and things started out pretty good. I liked the people, I liked the concept, and I got along pretty well with everyone. \n\nBy the time I joined, it was getting a little late, and so since I'm in Australia, around the time I'm heading off, it's like 10am for everyone else. This information will become important later. \n\nI've been active for about 2 hours, I've been interacting with everyone, I've submitted my characters, and I've already seemingly made a few friends. I go to bed, and wake up the next morning and immediately go to check this new server since I'm thoroughly enjoying it already. \n\nI say good morning to everyone, we get chatting for a little, and most of them have to go to bed, while those who didn't continue to talk. \n\nAt this point I hadn't yet noticed that 3 people's name colour had been changed to red, after they received a role of 'main bitch.' By the time I realized that they had different coloured names, I checked and just thought \"Oh, ok, so they're the admins?\" I would quickly realize that was not the case.\n\nWhen the owner gets back online, I've been at uni for most of the day, so they've added more to their server, including a 'public' channel, and a 'private' channel, which the 3 'main bitches' and myself are in. I don't think anything of it, because the other members who weren't in the private channel weren't online yet, so I didn't immediately notice that they weren't in the channel. This is where the blatant favoritism, exclusion and general bad feelings start.\n\nWe're all having a good time, and I make what I assumed were obvious, goodhearted jokes, that had already been established as jokes between all of us. Well, I get booted from the private channel, and I'm obviously confused about what I've done wrong, and so I message the owner to see what happened, and they say it was just pettiness and jealousy. \n\nEventually I am let back in the next day, but not before shit went down. \n\nI go to bed eventually, but things were said and that was when I noticed the different colours of the names, and soon realize what the roles actually mean. \n\nTo backtrack a little, me and another member of the server started messaging in the dm's, discussing possible arcs between two of our characters, and quickly became friends. \n\nAfter certain things between the owner and main bitches was happening in the public channel (I can't specifically remember how I got to this point or exactly what had been said), I start to get a few uneasy feelings, and almost left out and unwelcome, because everything very much revolved around the main bitches, and I started to notice the favoritism.  \n\nI bring it up to this new friend who I will call 'Jack'. I mention to Jack that I'm feeling a little weird and unwelcome, and we decide to bring it up in the server. And here is when the real problems start.\n\nI start the conversation, saying that I feel really left out and unwelcome, and my overthinking is starting to make me worry. A few other people come forward to say that they were also getting that feeling. \n\nA massive fight starts from there. \n\nThe owner and main bitches start defending themselves by saying that some people get closer than others. Which yes, I can absolutely agree, that happens in servers. But when it turns into blatant favoritism and makes others feel weird and unwelcome? That's when it becomes a little more than just being close.\n\nI've kind of gone quiet, just watching as it unfolds and others explain why they're feeling certain ways and what other's have done to make them uncomfortable, etc.. \n\nI end up apologizing for starting such a problem and that it was just me overthinking things, and that sometimes I can feel that way because of the time differences. Looking back now, what followed was subtle gaslighting, manipulation and guilt tripping, which did what is was meant to and made me feel worse. \n\nFollowing this, the owner agrees to let me back into the private channel since it was only meant to be a temporary thing anyway. \n\nI go to uni, and come back to have a look through the private channel, worried about what might have been said behind our backs. \n\nAnd I was right.\n\nBehind our backs they were mocking two other members for their bad writing, being annoying despite them not doing anything, and them 'always popping up at the wrong time', with the main bitches saying that they should just be kicked because they weren't wanted anyway. \n\nThey even made a separate server just for themselves.\n\nWhat really bothered me was that they were saying one thing to our faces, and running to the private channel to say completely differently behind our backs, insulting me for bringing it up, insulting others, and being really big jerks. \n\nI just left after that. \n\nThis all happened within the span of 3 days...",

            "selftext": "Okay this is a doozy guys...\n\nI meet this guy on my RP site and he seems okay at first, so I add him on discord and we talk for a bit. He starts conversations with me, \"That's cool!\" I think to myself, not many people message me...then his entitled personality starts to come out. He continually messages me on discord when I don't feel like talking and I politely explain to him that I don't like people trying to talk to me too much.\n\nI'm an introverted person and I'm on the spectrum and I feel exhausted when talking to somebody new. Does he listen? No. He keeps doing it. His behaviour gets worse, I go on Do Not Disturb on discord, invisible, NOPE! HE STILL KEEPS TRYING TO FUCKING TALK TO ME. \n\nHe's badgering me for RP which I no longer want to do with him because he's really really annoying and his blatant disrespect for me really puts me off wanting to anything with him. So I'm looking for any reason to get rid of him. He's rude about this quirk I have where I can judge whether someone would be a good fit for me based on the *feel* of their writing.\n\nHe tells me that I can't judge someone on their writing given a paragraph or two, to be frank, I didn't really like how he wrote and just because hundreds of people enjoyed roleplaying with him it didn't mean that I would and I really had no interest in roleplaying with him anymore because his entitlement towards my attention really really angered me.\n\nHe would throw fits if he didn't have a conversation with me, but I FUCKING NEEDED SPACE! This guy was fucking smothering me! I needed to recharge, but he wouldn't leave me alone!\n\n\"That's it.\" I think to myself, I want him gone. He's telling me what I can and can't do, he's badgering me for roleplay and he's disrespecting my need for space. Like he's entitled to my time and attention! He stalks me on different characters and I'm beyond creeped out now. So I block him on the website I met him on and discord.\n\nI get a message from him on this website, I won't put it down word for word but I'll summarise it. This fucking creep tells me he'll miss me and that he'll \"give me permission\" to have space and time away from him when I want that \"space and time away from him\" to be indefinite! So I archive that message and wash my hands of this guy! I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM! He's saying he \"misses\" me but he doesn't know me from a bar of fucking soap! He's not known me long enough to \"MISS\" me! \n\nI'm so uncomfortable at his fucking smothering clingy behaviour, I want him to fucking leave me alone  because this is just so disturbing now.\n\nTHEN I LOG IN TO MY FAVOURITE WEBSITE! Which my account is deactivated because I didn't really use it but you can still look at at art and re-activate your account if you decide to. You can also still receive messages on it. Guess what I find?\n\nThis fucking gigantic fucking creep has no graduated to STALKING ME to another website! His messages range from \"PLEASE! I'M SORRY! I'LL PAY YOU MONEY TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE!\"\n\nI'm really really really distressed. So I block him. He MAKES 3 MORE ACCOUNTS TO CIRCUMVENT BLOCK AND TRIES TO MESSAGE ME AGAIN TO UNBLOCK HIM! Then! On his last account he made, he sends me a message, calling me anti-social because I don't want to talk to him all the time and the fact he's stalking me on different characters when I don't want to talk to him just plain creeps me out!\n\nHe writes PARAGRAPHS of abuse, saying I'm too dumb to get a job and claiming I'll be homeless in a meth addict den when my parents die and that I'm not going to have any friends outside of college. He wishes loneliness upon me and claims I'm an empty, hollow, bully of a person much like my emotionally abusive parents which he knows DICK about.\n\nCool. He likes to throw what I said in my face when I confided in him. In retrospect, it was fucking dumb but he seemed reasonable at the time and he's threatening me harm, claiming he'll steal my \"retarded\" hybrid character and become popular so I can \"whine over the attention\" because ALLEGEDLY I want to be a popular furry!  I'm supposedly wanting. I'D FUCKING HATE THAT! Oh my god, that'd be a fucking NIGHTMARE!\n\nLMAO NO. This dude knows nothing on me. He then insults my South African Impala furry character for my use of \"Lekker\" which means \"Good/Nice\" but is under the impression it's German, not Afrikaans so he mocks my intelligence for not using \"German\" correctly! \n\nThen he threatens me harm on this 4th sock puppet and he tells me that he's \"done\" with me and that he cannot hold anger in his heart, then reiterates that he wants me to be alone and wants me to think of him when I'm \"alone\".\n\nI don't own the trademark on that \"retarded\" hybrid - He's absolutely free to use that \"retarded\" hybrid, I made my hybrid character because it actually reflects my actual heritage. He's an asian animal/european animal hybrid because I'm half asian and I wanted to do it because it was funny and I thought it would be cool to have them have the markings of an asian animal...just for shits and giggles...then play him as a serious character.\n\nThen, when I think I'm done with him after he claims he wants nothing to do with me, what do I find? My stalker wanting to add me on discord. I've denied his request so many times because I want FUCK ALL to do with him.\n\nWhat does he do? He makes another sock puppet for discord to try and add me again. I'm fucking more annoyed than creeped out now. He's tried to add me 5 or 6 times now! I just want him to leave me alone. \n\nHe cannot get it through his head that I don't want his \"GIFTS\" or his friendship or his money. He's emotionally abused me, crossed several lines and threatened me with physical harm. I had to tell admins to leave me alone on the art website. I don't want to deal with him anymore!\n\nHe thinks I want to be friends with him after all that. I just want to be left alone!\n\nI've contacted discord about him and all they could do was \"HaVe YoU TrIeD BlOcKiNg HiM?\" and nothing's been done about it. He will harass me on discord until I deactivate my discord because I just don't want to deal with him. \n\nSo if anyone could  give me advice, I would appreciate it. This is a bizarre situation and I'd be really grateful for any help that can be offered. This has gone on for 6 months now and I want it to stop.",

I think they\u2019re only really around for the social aspect and that\u2019s great. We\u2019re a great and supportive group of friends. \n\nBut\n\nThis person also tries to take wanted ads and throw their hat into a group plotting thread which I don\u2019t think is fair because it puts the other person in an awkward position of saying no. \n\nRecently I had an idea for a group thread that is going to provide some good development and a fun plot! I dropped it in our plotting channel and then this person came along and offered their character for a pretty significant plot point of the thread and I have kind of just grazed over their request but it keeps coming back up. \n\nUsually I\u2019m very good at being direct but I really don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. They do a lot of \u201cI\u2019m gonna post when I get home\u201d \u201csorry my mental health took a nose dive when I got home and I didn\u2019t feel like writing\u201d \u201cgoing to write this weekend!\u201d \u201cSorry I don\u2019t feel up to it\u201d\n\nAnd I get it. We\u2019re all a little neurodivergent and need to take care of ourselves and writing when you\u2019re not feeling it isn\u2019t great. I don\u2019t want anyone to force anything at all BUT I feel that this person needs to recognize that they\u2019re not a good fit for the plot because it isn\u2019t fair for the rest of the writers to have to wait a month plus and HOPE that the thread is the one they chose to reply to to avoid the activity check that round, not when this isn\u2019t a fluffy fun thread and it\u2019s supposed to impact several character\u2019s development. \n\nI need both validation that my reasoning is valid and maybe a nice way to phrase this without hurting feelings so I can decline their involvement in said plot.",

They told me they've been sick , and ofcourse I respected that, I told them to take whatever time they needed to heal and they told me they'd probably be back within a day or two. But it's been yet another week, and now I'm not completely sure what i should do next.\n\nI'm not doubting that they're sick, not at all, they have no reason to lie to  me and I have no reason to doubt them; however I'm a little unsure as of what to do with it.\nI really liked our roleplay, and them in general , they were really communicative and I guess that's why these two weeks feels even \"wierder\" or something. But I guess as long as I get a little advice on what **i** can do now, then that's all I can ask for.\n\nDo I wait? Or do I message them again soon? I'm not completely sure if two weeks with one ooc conversation is really that bad or not, perhaps I'm paranoid, but I guess we'll see. \n\n[I think I mentioned this in a pervious post but I'm quite bad with communication, social cues, etc. So please go a little easy on me]",
