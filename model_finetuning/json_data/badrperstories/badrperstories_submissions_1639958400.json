I won\u2019t say his name for Reasons but there was this Other person, Who was 15. They both SPARKED immediately. By that I mean the SECOND the 18-21 year old joined the server he made Head-cannons of there Ocs in love. And Of course there Characters where married. Nothing bad about that! Right? Wrong. It started off there was this server just labled \u201csex.\u201d And before it got named that the Older person said to me \u201cWanna join this server! It\u2019s tons of fun!\u201d And of course me thinking none of it, I just met this guy, what could\u2019ve gone Wrong? He made me watch him and that underaged boy have sex. In the other server my charater was a young boy- 6 years old, his adoptive dad was the cannotic child of the two guys. Unfortunately I was there cannotic grandchild. So Of course, I got told too Role-play with them. It was kinda fun- Until the guy started calling me Dear, Hunny and all sorts of things outside of Roleplay. I left that server 2 weeks ago, this isn\u2019t a bad rp story its just weird as fuck but I wanted to share how dangerous people can be LMAO",

            "selftext": "I used to be really good at marketing servers. Like, I geeked out for it. I loved learning about the demographics of every bot-site, forum, subreddit, and hub server to tailor ads for servers so each ad was highlighting the part of the server that would be the most interesting to the people wherever I was posting. I taught myself search engines optimization, so now you can literally google my main server and we're the first 10 results. You can google half my server's name, and we're still the top result despite there being a physical place by that same name.   \n\n\nFour years of this. Bumping, timing my reposts, making sure the server's active so people don't join and think it's just dead. Pulling in players from all over the world, so it doesn't matter what time of day or night you come in - someone's talking, something's happening.   \n\n\nI learned about the trends and when different age groups of roleplayers are looking for new places to write, so in those times of the year - I'm spamming my ads. \"Come join the longest running mage school RP on Discord.\" It's a flex. I have every right to be proud.   \n\n\nBut I noticed something recently. I've internalized every failure. Every time someone rage quits. Every time someone comes in and leaves without a word. Every time there's been a player who, for whatever reason, we just disconnect with communication so they feel unwelcome. I look on this subreddit and see dozens of posts about people bitching about Admins who have cliques and skew stories or who make their characters the main characters while everyone else is cannon fodder. And I scour them paranoid that some small details were changed, but maybe I'm who they're talking about.   \n\n\nI tell myself that it's okay because I'm self-aware enough that I see the failures and I work not to repeat them. That as long as I'm open enough to understand my fault in something, then I'm doing my best and I'm not the evil admin. And they're probably not talking about me.   \n\n\nEvery time someone comes in and compliments the server, and everyone's like \"Yeah OP wrote this, she's great!\" I post a blushing emote and a heart and say \"thank you so much,\" but those compliments go to the story and I cannot internalize them. I can't put them into myself and say \"I wrote this. They love it, and I wrote it.\" I can't because half the people who do this come in and they want to write with everyone but me, so it has to be me, right? They love the story, they hate its owner. I never wanted to be the closed off Admin in the tower, looking down at everyone and cracking the whip when they fuck up. But sometimes I get so sad and so lonely up here, and I don't know how to just say \"hey, I'm not a GM, guys. I made this world because I want to write in it. I feel left out. Please let me in.\"   \n\n\nBecause how many times have I read something on here about an Admin forcing themselves into a story or needing the story to be all about them. So, I have 3 people I feel comfortable writing with. And then I get accused of the same clique-playing that I'm always on players about. Is it the same though? Clique-playing is only writing with your friends and edging everyone else out. What I'm doing is hiding, essentially. Because I'll post an open scene and it'll just sit there until the timer runs out and I have to close it.   \n\n\nEvery day it feels like the narrative is that I'm not wanted. I'm the owner but I feel like I'm the server slave. It's always some question to answer, writing an NPC for someone else's arc, redoing the graphics to update the story. I'm a janitor for the server. Without me, it wouldn't run. I know that. But I don't really feel like I have the freedom to write my stories anymore. I love the world that I build so much. It's the only story, the only character I've ever really wanted to write. And I'm honoured that so many people have come in and loved the world enough to bring their muses here.   \n\n\nBut no one ever wants to actually write with my main character. Everyone celebrates my side characters, because they fuel other people's content, but no one will touch my main. I don't know how I'm expected to keep it running. My ads work because I'm inspired by the story when I write them. But I can't be inspired when I feel like everyone is just wishing my primary muse didn't exist and when I'm being actively edged out of play.   \n\n\nI don't feel like I can take a break. So I'm just sitting here staring at my computer, knowing I have to catch up on posts, and all I feel is abused and taken for granted. I don't know how to shake myself out of this. I've felt this way for the last year. Maybe it's the standard I've held myself to. I know other people have expected a level of professionalism from me, and I've tried, but I'm human. I don't know how else to say it. I'm a human that's treated like a robot, always having work to do, no room for creativity. I need help, but I don't know where to get it. I'm so tired.",

            "selftext": "Merry Christmas everyone!\n\nYou may have seen my post about the south park RPer that told me not to educate them on Judaism. I also had problems with this person sending me a multiparagraph rant that I'm not going to post a screenshot of because it requires too much context. The reason for said rant? They did not like something that my character thought inside his head, and decided that their character would think mine was an asshole now, again, because of something he thought inside his head where their character would have no way to hear it.\n\nPreviously, the south park person had complained to me about another RPer in a specific fandom who had supposedly caused problems with them. Come to find out, the person they were complaining about was a friend of mine, who sent me screenshots...of them doing essentially the exact same thing, complaining about thoughts that were inside their character's head.\n\nAnyway fast forward to this morning. I receive a DM asking who the person was, because they are giving yet another person a problem, this time with violating a 'no canon characters' boundary. Guess what? Given the description, it's the same person.\n\nAnyone else find it validating when someone who gave you trouble turns out to also be giving lots of other people trouble?\n\nJust a rant!",

But it didn't mention anything about NSFW. \n\nWe started talking in more detail about how things would work and expectations and I put in a few important points myself, because I'm aware it's a problem for some people so I'll be straight up about it in the start which included that I don't do ERP. \n\nSo they said I might have a problem so I straight up asked if sex scenes were mandatory and they said not mandatory, but I don't like censorship.\n\nSo, I (very politely I thought) said that was a dealbreaker for me, but good look and maybe include that in your ad. \n\nAnd suddenly he accused me of being aggressive and that I was intentionally misinterpreting what he was saying. And than he blocked me.\n\nSo, like I'm just confused. I thought we just figured out we weren't compatible after all. Was I actually in the wrong?",

Simple. \n\nI recently had a rather insecure young man come into my dms and there are very clearly some issues he needs to resolve. I had made an rp about mages and such. He came in wanting to be my characters mentor. Problem was I wasn't really taken with his character description and as much as his character was described as a Futa, I knew he was male and personally don't sub for men, which is what he wanted. He wanted me to be the sub. But he only revealed this after I explained my character was already experienced and powerful enough to learn independently. And he immediately said that was a \"deal breaker\" because he didn't like \"brats\" in bed and prefered willing subs. Two things, I never even said anything about my preferences in bed and never said anything about being a brat. I only said my characters genuine personality was independent and he didn't need an authority figure, in normal life or the bed. \n\nI explained my character further to him and he proceeded to insult my rp post, even though he was the one who came to me first out of interest for it. And then turned to essentially calling me a fat, neckbearded basement dweller. Which I found quite insulting as I am only a little less chubby to classify as having a  dad bod \ud83d\ude24 the audacity. But no from then I had no actual hope for this young man being an RP partner with me because I can't respect someone who blatantly attacks someone for not letting them be their writing partner. It's rude, arrogant and childish. I've had some fantastic rp partners and I've been rejected by countless others. It happens. If you seriously take offence to a stranger on the internet not liking your writing styles or ideas, that's not their issue.",

            "selftext": "Coincidentally before I wrote this.. you\u2019re right.. I was roleplaying with some people over my winter break. I\u2019ve bumped into plenty of people who would want to \u201ccompete\u201d with you, even weirdly in ERPs. Another thing I noticed is that when you have a character, the person you rp with totally takes over your character. For instance, they speak and write all of the actions of your characters without your permission. It ruins the whole point of role playing because you written everything for my character.. how the FUCK am I going to reply back?\n\nLastly, on discord and reddit I have posted descriptions of what I wanted in my roleplays. If I was doing ERP, I\u2019ve posted kinks and turn offs. I get people who would half ass read my plot and everything I asked for my rp partners to NOT do.. \u201chey can we add (insert turn off here)\u201d or begin to ask me about the plot when the shit is written out on the ad. Then if it\u2019s not to their liking, they\u2019ll ask me if I could change shit for them. It\u2019s frustrating and even though ghosting is pretty rude, I often do it when I feel like I\u2019m roleplaying with a complete moron.\n\nI can\u2019t stand high and mighty, I\u2019m not a professional roleplayer but I look to have fun, not having to explain shit that was all written out or having to back out of the rp because I feel like my roleplay character have been completely taken over and written for before I even had a chance to play them.

            "selftext": "**alt title: communication is nice, especially if you're going to be busy right after grabbing a rp**\n\nI picked up a roleplay about two weeks ago and me and the other writer seemed to get along great, to the point they stayed up so that we could finished plotting out the idea. I went ahead and wrote out the intro since I had *ideas*. Told them to let me know if they wanted/needed edits, but that I'd left it open for their character since it's a bit of a seek and find set up. I didn't expect a response since it was late on their end and figured I would get a response of some sort in the morning. By response I mean confirmation that they'd seen my question. With it being December, I assume people are going to be a touch busy because of the holidays/finals...At the same time, I run with the slight assumption that if someone messages me for a plot idea I have, that they're at least capable of adding another story to their list.\n\nNope, 'tomorrow' turned into four days. Finally, I politely nudged them, fully expecting them to have vanished, like a fart in the wind. In my experience, radio silence immediately after starting a roleplay means \"ghosted but not ghosted\", whatever, better now than when I'm super invested. Surprisingly, they responded to me and stated that they'd been traveling, which isn't surprising with the time of year. Still, a quick heads up of \"I'm going to be traveling for \\[whatever time\\] and won't be able to respond, but I'm hella interested in what we threw together\" would have been nice...Or even a confirmation that my intro worked/didn't work for them (which I *still* have no idea if it did or didn't).\n\nShort conversation even shorter, I told them it was fine, to stay safe, and promptly chunked the roleplay into my 'inactive' folder. Probably wise since I haven't heard anything else from them and I'm honestly not expecting to.",

            "selftext": "So for the sake of anonymity I will be using fake names for both people and OCs. This first bit is for context.\n\nSo this takes place on a Roleplay Server so there are multiple \u2018plots\u2019 going on. By plots I meant erp cuz its an erp roleplay server but nonetheless there are some meaningful interactions. This shitty rp begins with a guy we\u2019ll call Benjamin. Benjamin is actually a decent guy. He\u2019s a decent role player and can make some decent characters (He does this thing where he makes his character sheets excessively long to annoy and bug staff in harmless trolling. He still does it last I checked.) anyways Benjamin was ruler of the Discount Nords (The base lore for the server was kind of mediocre, but it was serviceable). He rped fairly with other people and tried to make things interesting. His character was trying to modernize the Nords, steerig them away from offbrand vikings. Enter the reason this post was made. Zach walks in with his Jarl saying he wanted to overthrow Benjamin\u2019s character. It kijd of throws a wrench in this plan that Ben and the owner were cooking up but Ben agrees. Zach\u2019s traditional jarl proceeds to power-game to the extremes in Ben and his\u2019 first rp. (How one slips their entire army past 3 layers of walls confuses me) Ben is obviously annoyed but plays along anyways.\n\nSo the characters are about to fight it out and then tragedy strikes for Ben. Again for the sake of anonymity im omitting the tragedy bit but Ben is forced to give the throne over to zach while he deals with IRL matters. This is not what im ranting about, its what happened afterwards. To put it simply he went mad with the power. The amount if power gaming and metagaming was horrific. He rushed the plot that Ben and the owner planned 3 weeks after taking control. Caused 30 people to leave. After the horde of complaints the staff eventually forced him to leave. The aftermath was also messy. Important events are often used as a sort of guide for the plots timeline. His actions and subsequent leave resulted in them having to do a reset. So yeah. There\u2019s my story about power gaming",

Proceeded to eventually send me thousands of words about how their portrayal was perfect, that the things my character privately *thought* about theirs was wrong, and that I was too 'sensitive'.\n\nThey also blamed their horrible, rude behavior on being autistic, which is honestly disgusting. Another friend I RP with had a similar experience with this same RPer and I have found it very cathartic to know that this terrible experience is clearly not an isolated incident. I've RPd for 20+ years and never, EVER encountered someone as bad as this.

Had to take a long hiatus from roleplaying 'cause ended up having a burnout and a disastrous experience after a while with the said partner.\n\nRealized I don't have any other enjoyable hobbies beside roleplaying these days and want a lil' bit of distraction. Decided to go with indie roleplaying again this time. Most of my old partners are gone. Noticed that the scenery has been pretty dead and it is hard to attract any hearts on the posts. Checked tags and saw everyone's starter &amp; plot calls looking also pretty dead. Not sure if it is influenced by holidays or something else.\n\nDefinitely noticed a huge shift in aesthetics as most blogs are looking simpler now (yay!) and more pleasing to eye. Though, the usage of super tiny icons still around. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? What are popular fandoms on tumblr currently? Shall I consider using more popular face claims? Any tips?",

They ask if I\u2019m still open and I say yes, and everything follows. I explain the plots I had for different characters as I had put a line up for people to choose from. We go through it, list off kinks and such, and he\u2019s cool with everything. So we start off, they asked that I start off the scene and so I do, now with my writing style, I prefer being able to set the scene! it lets me craft up something before hand to lead into the rest of the story, this one being an ERP and with this especially, it just helps to set something up before hand instead of just go straight to the lewd stuff, a bit if pre-game you know? well I guess that my literal 2 messages into the RP was too long because they start to immediately get into some sexual set up. alright that\u2019s fine by me, no big deal. when I try to follow the plot that we had discussed, they start saying things out of RP as to how I\u2019m taking too long and not doing what they wanted. I\u2019m just a little blown away by this, so I politely apologize and ask how they want me to continue, they talk about how they want me to take advantage of the character they were playing as, I had already said before I\u2019m not really comfortable with the rape trope side of things, flipping the script on how we\u2019d already discussed things,\nBasically putting me on the spot of being the dom and not the sub which I was a little unprepared for, so trying my best to ease into it since I\u2019m not the greatest at dom roleplay, being why I primarily play sub, I attempt to ease into it, after more complaining and telling me what to do, everything being completely outside of my writing style, I politely try to step away from the RP since it\u2019s clearly not going to work out especially if I have to force a new writing style on myself, which immediately downgrades my quality and takes the fun out if the RP. They then try to force me to keep going and I just keep politely declining, after a little while more of trying they just start getting mad at me for \u2018not trying hard enough and giving up\u2019\nthey just resort to berating me and say they have something else to do, I\u2019m not sure what happened here but I just kinda wanted to vent and give a clear testament about forcing other peoples writing styles. as well as ask a question, should I have tried harder with this person and maybe started over or was I alright to decline their advances at continuing the RP?",

            "selftext": "i have another Roleplay tale to tell here this one was is a bit shorter than my Story of \"Jason the Dickhead brother\"\n\nI had received a message from someone i'll call Maria, she wanted to Roleplay and since my Roleplay posts typically go ignored i was happy to have someone interested in roleplaying. \nShe wanted to do something with Demons in a High Fantasy World, Since i love High Fantasy i agreed and i have yet to try playing a demon so i was down for that\n\nMaria  wanted to do NSFW/Smut style Roleplay,  my general rule to NSFW/Smut in Roleplay is as long as it was handled tastefully, Tactfully and can be Balanced with other Roleplay elements like Story or  Combat then i really didn't really mind.\n Then she admits to wanting something incestuous Aunt X Nephew I've experimented with some incest stuff but was ultimately looking to get out of doing that all together, so i figured once more wouldn't hurt. \nBut this would be my last time \"Keeping it in the Family\" \n\nDuring the OOC chat she let me know she couldn't Roleplay as frequently as most people can, with the time difference her in Brazil and me in the states, and having to care for her Ill mother. \nAgain not a big deal, i understand people have lives outside of Roleplay and if they can't reply frequently that was ok, as we could always work something out. \n\nMaria then asks if i liked BBWs? And before i could give a definitive yes or no answer, she gets the drop on me by sending  two unsolicited tit pics Frontal and Side.\n I very politely informed Maria that i didn't think i could give her the Roleplay experience she wanted and reminded her to not expose her breasts to someone on the internet she's known for less than 10 minutes and promptly blocked her. \n\nDo i like BBWs? If we have Chemistry with  then yes i do.\n And for anyone curious no i don't Have Maria's Tit pics anymore.\n\n\n And I'll just say if you're role-playing with your SO and exposing your private parts is part of said Roleplay then by all means go Wild, but please don't randomly expose any of your body parts to people you barely know on the internet",

            "selftext": "I have bad experiences with people all of the time, in person, online, while roleplaying, you name it.   \nI don't typically find the need to make posts about it all my shitty experiences because I'll never interact with these people ever again- but this one person.   \nOH MY GOD HOW THEY BOILED MY BLOOD.    \nThis is sort of a long post- I have a lot to say and I'm really heated. So, I'm really sorry about the length. \n\nMy first mistake, I suppose, was going to a fandom that has a mostly childish/immature audience   \n( Warrior Cats by Erin Hunter ).   \nThat fandom was the first fandom I ever roleplayed in, and I really missed it.   \nI was lucky to find a subreddit with active people regarding this fandom and I sent out a message to DM me if they wanted to roleplay.   \nYou know how it goes.   \n\n\nWell anyways, I got someone that responded and we started to chat.   \nWe started to chat and the only \"off\" thing I noticed was their lack of punctuation.   \nThat didn't really bother me considering we were talking nonchalantly, and to be fair, I don't use punctuation all of the time when I'm texting people either.   \nThough, this all started to BECOME an issue, when in roleplay, this person was not using punctuation at all. Instead they opted to send me paragraph-length run-on sentences. All of which detailed several character's narratives, thoughts, and dialogue. \n\n  \nMoving into the characters... They weren't that good.  \nI'm no stranger to shitty characters. I MADE shitty characters and to some people, I probably still do.   \nI try and ignore these half-baked oafs until one character comes into play.   \nNow, this character, for some reason had BOTH  Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and BPD ( still unclear if the abbreviation was referring to Borderline Personality Disorder or BiPolar Disorder ).   \nAll three disorders are really heavy. My sister has BiPolar and I have Borderline- both of which is a daily struggle for both us of.  \nRegardless, I was pretty upset to hear that this character that had 2 disorders was named ( drumroll please ), CRAZYFACE.   \nCrazy-fuckin-face.   \nAre you kidding me?? That is not only extremely immature but insensitive.   \nI don't want to be referred to as \"crazy\" for something i can't control. I know damn well my sister, other people with out disorders, people with OTHER disorders don't want to be referred to as \"crazy\" either. \n\nI sort of had it at this point. I can deal with your crappy form and you other shitty characters, but the whole \"Crazyface\" thing got under my skin.   \nI didn't want to JUST leave them on read, block them, or just say \"okay im done here bye\". \n\nI wanted to help them improve not only their characters but their technique.   \nSo like the idiot I am, I spent some time out of my day to type out a heartfelt message in order to help them. I copy and pasted- but I also took some irrelevent stuff out for the sake of space.   \n *Im really, really sorry to do this to you, but I think its wise that we part ways.*   \n*You seem genuine, sweet, and passionate- which makes me feel very guilty.*    \n*For one, I can tell I'm much older than you, and it makes me uncomfortable for several reasons.*   \n*I'm pretty much going to be 18 in a year- and I just makes me feel weird that I'm speaking to someone younger than me.*    \n*Secondly, your characters sort of make me.. uncomfortable.*  \n*Please take this as a word of caution, if you're going to make characters with mental illnesses make sure A) you research them thoroughly. I'm talking having notes, reading several articles and scholarly journal etc. B) Always add disclaimers too.*    \n*It can be very offensive to have a character with a mental illness that you portray wrong. Remember, mental illness come with trauma. I noticed one of your characters has BPD, and whether that be Borderline Personality Disorder ( which I have ) or BiPolar Disorder ( which my sister has ).*   \n*It's slightly triggering for me to see people talk to lightheartedly about these topics, because what my sister and I experienced in order to get these disorders is very troubling.*    \n*If a character is going to have any mental illness at all, PLEASE research that. Research statistics of people having it, the symptoms and signs, the troubles and hardships, how someone might get it, etc. People on the internet don't take this stuff lightly, and I am telling you, as someone who is older than you and is looking out for you- don't mess around with people online. Research before you give characters these illnesses, please.*    \n*Mental illness are hard to live with, and they should be hard to write too. That's just my opinion. So please, if you're going to continue on with mental illness, research and do it respectfully.*    \n*Third of all, your format is hard to read and understand. You don't use any sort of punctuation at all, and what you send me is one huge run-on sentence.*    \n*What I suggest, for furfure reference is this: 1. Character name observers something and does an action. 2. Character name thinks and does an action. There are so many variant of this simple format that can vastly improve your cohesiveness.  In order to help the flow, make sure you separate your thoughts and ideas. If a character is walking, that should be one paragraph / line. If they are speaking, make that another. Thinking? Make it another. So on and so forth. It helps, trust me.*    \n*Also, PLEASE use punctuation.*   \n*On that note, since you do roleplay many characters, try using one paragraph per character.*  \n*Doing this \\^\\^\\^ is so much easier to see who is doing what, and what is going on.*    \n*Fourthly, I am a very chill person. I roleplay to relax. That being said, I let a lot of things slide that others may not. That being said, be careful when you are \"godmodding\", and inserting characters into the narrative. When you introduced 'Crazyface' I had no idea WHAT or WHO he was to Crowheart. Always ask the person you are roleplaying with the relationship they had. It was very confusing and frustrating to try and understand Crow and Crazy's relationship based off 2 or 3 lines.*   \n*Furthermore, on the same topic- being \"godmodding\". A lot of people are not okay with you taking control of the narrative.  Some stuff is more okay than others.  Such as, if Crow is sitting down minding her own buisness and you want her to notice something its okay to say this: As the black she-cat was sitting by the lake, a blur of orange and white came barreling past.*    \n*This allows your partner to decide if THEY want to react. Its much more fun for the other person if you do something like that as opposed to this: The black-she cat noticed a blur of orange and white, she turned her head as it sparked her curiosity.*    \n*Because, I can tell you, some people will get very upset at you if you do this.*    \n*Please heed my warnings. I am telling you this because I've been on the internet since I was like 8. Im going to be a full fledged adult soon. I know what goes on, I know how people act, and I want to help you.  I can see potential in you. You just have to keep working on it. I would be more than willing to help you improve your skill by giving you tips to writing characters, plots, and other stuff. I've been roleplaying for a very long time now.  I wish you the best of luck, please consider what I say.  Thank you* \n\nI felt very proud about that message. I felt mature and that I was going to help someone out. Trust me when I say I know what it's like to be bullied and harassed for not being as good as other people- so my heart really goes out to people like this person. I wanted to help them improve but clearly they had a stick shoved so far up their ass they can't realize they hey- maybe you're wrong.   \nThe gave me some half-assed defense about how they were older than me and how they have dyslexia and DID.   \nI don't even want to touch the whole DID thing. And to be fair, if you older than me ( 22 in college, as they told me ) would you really be roleplaying Warrior Cats? Like- it's a book for kids? I'm 17- which is well past the age to enjoy those books.   \nAnd the whole dyslexic thing. I'm dyslexic too? It's not usually relevant because I do a pretty good job at masking it- also because I use spellcheckers, dictionaries, and text-to-speech to help me.   \nJust because you have a learning disorder, doesn't mean you are immune to critique regarding the way you text/roleplay.   \nNow, since they sent me like 10 messages regarding this, undermining the critiques I had given them, and to me, dismissing me as a bad person trying to attack them, I got mad. If they would have just said \"oh okay thanks\" or something along those lines, all would be well.   \nBut no, they had to say something. So I said something back.   \nWhich, I think is fair.   \nI basically told them that I would take everything at face value, even though I don't really believe them.  I asked them once more to just- reconsider what I have to say. I went in on them again regarding the whole BPD thing. I can say, I started to get a little harsher on them. I did tell them that they were just trying to ignore my critiques with bullshit excuses instead of actually improving. In addition, I did tell them if they didn't TRY to improve no one is going to want to roleplay with them and people are going to keep getting mad at them. Like in my first message, I offered to help them. \n\nSure that message could have been seen as rude, but I felt it was necessary. Who else was going to tell them to maybe not refer to mentally ill people are crazy, and they're shooting themselves in the foot by not trying to improve.   \n\n\nI though all was well afterwards. We went our separate paths after that. Until today.   \nWe had not spoken since the 16th, mind you, when they came out of nowhere an sent me this:   \n*Yknow what*  \n\n*Fuck you*  \n\n*Dyslexia is not just a learning disorder*    \n*It's the most fucking annoying thing I have to deal with and you wouldn't get that you don't have it*    \n\n\n*And I had to deal with mentally abusive parents for 15 years*  \n\n*I cant read words correctly half the time and may aswell make it so I cannot write with my hands at all because my handwriting is so fucking atrocious that 90% of the time you can't read it I had someone ask what I wrote when all I wrote was the*  \n\n*I wasn't trying to minamalize your critiques with \"bullshit\" or \"excuses\" I was saying what's wrong with me I'm not a mentally stable person and when I read that for a good 10 minutes I wanted to fucling kill myself feeling like I'm worthless not good enough that I'll never amount to anything it's not the people who tell me to kill myself on the internet that get to me  It's people like you*  \n\n*People who I started to trust*  \n\n*And I dont care what you have to say I'm done responding have fun with your life knowing you almost took one*  \n\n*Sincerely lyre.*   \n\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this. I guess I'm glad it's over? I don't know.   \nI really needed to get this off my chest. \n\nI can definitely clear up anything you want me to, answer questions, show examples, etc.   \nI just- uurgg... I'm glad it's over, though I wish they didn't tell me that.",

            "selftext": "Despite being on Reddit for a pretty good amount of time, this is my first post\u2014so I apologize if I messed something up or if this isn't the right place to post this! This was just something I really needed to get off of my chest as it has been bothering me for a while and I don't know where else to talk about these sorts of things.\n\nSo, for a little over a year now, a close friend and I have been rping with some ocs of ours (first rping experience I've gotten, and for the most part it's been a blast). It was initially pretty small; at most we had like two characters each involved in the roleplay. For ease of reading, I'll call one of these first two characters of mine Aaron.\n\nAbout five months into the storyline of our rp (it's long and ongoing) my friend wanted to introduce a new character and storyline. Cool. I was totally down with that. \n\nThis character of hers was a sort of lab-created shapeshifter\u2014and basically her idea was that Aaron would be looking in the mirror, and her character would be in the mirror acting as his reflection until they would climb out and force him into some type of shenanigans. At the time, I loved that idea; so I agreed and the two of us wrote it out. The reason I mention this is because this character was a shapeshifter acting as Aaron's \"reflection\", meaning they looked exactly like him.\n\nNow, on top of rping, my friend and I are both artists\u2014so we like to draw a lot, design our characters through a visual medium and things like that.\n\nAnd this character of mine that I have both been writing and drawing for for the past year basically had a clone now\u2014because my friend's character actually did not have an appearance outside of looking like my character. Their \"design\" was made in the image of my character.\n\nAt first I didn't really mind; admittedly my ego liked the idea of there being two of my character, and so when my friend asked if I was okay with this character essentially being a clone of mine I stupidly replied yes.\n\nSo now, after a few months of developing these two characters' relationship and their story, here is how it has changed\u2014\n\nHer character has always been my character, Aaron's, reflection (think of something like Lake and Tulip from Infinity Train), and one day during their childhood they came out of the mirror to befriend him despite me having a fully fleshed out childhood/backstory for my character with little room for improvisation. The two of them had to separate for a while (an attempt on my part to keep my character's backstory mostly in tact), before the two of them eventually reunite again as adults.\n\nSo, my friend said that she was going to change up this character of hers so that they weren't completely identical to mine, because at one point I had actually admitted to her that it was beginning to bother me. What did she do to change the design? She gave them longer hair (Aaron's is short-ish) and gave them some extra muscle (Aaron is more tall and thin). That's pretty much it. They still use my character's design, they're still basically a clone, they apparently just grew their hair out and have a different diet than he does.\n\nAnd now, because she has changed like two things about this character, she thinks she... Owns the design...? Like she genuinely thinks that this character design that I made was made by her now because they are slightly different, even though she basically used mine as a base.\n\nI even named this character of hers. They did not even have a name until I suggested one that she liked.\n\nBack to the rping aspect of all of this, some of the things she says regarding these two characters has been especially irking to me\u2014just a couple weeks ago she said something like \"my character is like a stronger version of Aaron\" because in the rp Aaron has a more fearful/jumpy personality because of past abuse and trauma and her character does not.\n\nOr when my character had a relapse with his addiction due to heavy amounts of stress put on him and without any support from the other characters during the rp, she decided to make a joke out of it and twist it so that it seemed like he was deliberately ignoring other characters' help and just decided to shoot up on a whim when that was very much not the case. \n\nOr, probably the most infuriating, Aaron does have issues with intimacy because of a handful of traumatic experiences regarding bodily autonomy\u2014often feeling extremely uncomfortable or going into a panic when faced with physical intimacy. Despite my friend's character knowing this, however, lately in the rp they have been sulking or even yelling at my character because he is unable to meet their physical needs (the two are in a relationship even though Aaron was already in a relationship with another character of mine), and when talking about it with my friend she always says something like \"they just have anger issues\" or \"they just like physical contact and they miss being close with them\", continually making excuses for this borderline (if not straight up) abusive relationship. It honestly does seem like a toxic relationship to me that I hate putting my character through and that I hate writing for but my friend doesn't seem to acknowledge how unhealthy it is.\n\nAnyway, since this is getting pretty long I'm going to cut this short\u2014sorry if this is a little all over the place and confusing; this was really just the tip of the iceberg. But with all of this in mind, does it seem like maybe I'm overreacting?",

            "selftext": "3 months ago I joined an up-and-coming role play server on discord, and things started out pretty good. I liked the people, I liked the concept, and I got along pretty well with everyone.\n\nBy the time I joined, it was getting a little late, and so since I'm in Australia, around the time I'm heading off, it's like 10am for everyone else. This information will become important later.\n\nI've been active for about 2 hours, I've been interacting with everyone, I've submitted my characters, and I've already seemingly made a few friends. I go to bed, and wake up the next morning and immediately go to check this new server since I'm thoroughly enjoying it already.\n\nI say good morning to everyone, we get chatting for a little, and most of them have to go to bed, while those who didn't continue to talk.\n\nAt this point I hadn't yet noticed that 3 people's name colour had been changed to red, after they received a role of 'main bitch.' By the time I realized that they had different coloured names, I checked and just thought \"Oh, ok, so they're the admins?\" I would quickly realize that was not the case.\n\nWhen the owner gets back online, I've been at uni for most of the day, so they've added more to their server, including a 'public' channel, and a 'private' channel, which the 3 'main bitches' and myself are in. I don't think anything of it, because the other members who weren't in the private channel weren't online yet, so I didn't immediately notice that they weren't in the channel. This is where the blatant favoritism, exclusion and general bad feelings start.\n\nWe're all having a good time, and I make what I assumed were obvious, goodhearted jokes, that had already been established as jokes between all of us. Well, I get booted from the private channel, and I'm obviously confused about what I've done wrong, and so I message the owner to see what happened, and they say it was just pettiness and jealousy.\n\nEventually I am let back in the next day, but not before shit went down.\n\nI go to bed eventually, but things were said and that was when I noticed the different colours of the names, and soon realize what the roles actually mean.\n\nTo backtrack a little, me and another member of the server started messaging in the dm's, discussing possible arcs between two of our characters, and quickly became friends.\n\nAfter certain things between the owner and main bitches was happening in the public channel (I can't specifically remember how I got to this point or exactly what had been said), I start to get a few uneasy feelings, and almost left out and unwelcome, because everything very much revolved around the main bitches, and I started to notice the favoritism.\n\nI bring it up to this new friend who I will call 'Jack'. I mention to Jack that I'm feeling a little weird and unwelcome, and we decide to bring it up in the server. And here is when the real problems start.\n\nI start the conversation, saying that I feel really left out and unwelcome, and my overthinking is starting to make me worry. A few other people come forward to say that they were also getting that feeling.\n\nA massive fight starts from there.\n\nThe owner and main bitches start defending themselves by saying that some people get closer than others. Which yes, I can absolutely agree, that happens in servers. But when it turns into blatant favoritism and makes others feel weird and unwelcome? That's when it becomes a little more than just being close.\n\nI've kind of gone quiet, just watching as it unfolds and others explain why they're feeling certain ways and what other's have done to make them uncomfortable, etc..\n\nI end up apologizing for starting such a problem and that it was just me overthinking things, and that sometimes I can feel that way because of the time differences. Looking back now, what followed was subtle gaslighting, manipulation and guilt tripping, which did what is was meant to and made me feel worse.\n\nFollowing this, the owner agrees to let me back into the private channel since it was only meant to be a temporary thing anyway.\n\nI go to uni, and come back to have a look through the private channel, worried about what might have been said behind our backs.\n\nAnd I was right.\n\nBehind our backs they were mocking two other members for their bad writing, being annoying despite them not doing anything, and them 'always popping up at the wrong time', with the main bitches saying that they should just be kicked because they weren't wanted anyway.\n\nThey even made a separate server just for themselves.\n\nWhat really bothered me was that they were saying one thing to our faces, and running to the private channel to say completely differently behind our backs, insulting me for bringing it up, insulting others, and being really big jerks.\n\nI just left after that.\n\nThis all happened within the span of 3 days...",

            "selftext": "Hey. Been dealing with this twat for a while, just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nFor the sake of not being hunted down, I'll call this person \"Caramel\". Caramel is an RPer on my friends' servers who's been around for a while but has never really been liked by anyone there except for a small clique of their buddies ( and has actually been kicked and banned quite a few times for their rancid behaviour ). Their clique has several people who are much more talented and have created several spinoffs from the main server. That's the main background info for what will likely been a long and dull post.\n\nCaramel intially joined the server and was made an admin because they had enough dedication to \"help\" with RPs. Immediately, they used that power to crack down on memes related to everywhere at the end of time, deleting messages without saying why and yelling when she was confronted ( unless you were her friend, in which case you could post whatever memes you wanted ). Ultimately, this microdrama culminated in her deleting every message from another mod after he posted a meme that she didn't like resulting in her losing their adminship when the co-owner caught wind of this. \n\nAfter this, they became obsessed with the character family the co-owner had made, constantly complaining about how powerful they were in general and how they HATED powerful characters. They then went on to make an overpowered character solely to kill the co-owners characters ( they never got to use it beyond attempting to make them the main character, which typically happens with their characters ). \n\nFailing to really make any story of their own with her OC ( not sure how you could, lol ) they turned to the main arc of the server at the time - the owner's story he had been developing since the start of the server - and immediately attempted to hijack it for their own story. They used one of her characters to just \"steal the infinity stones\" for their own weapon without attempting to RP hunting them down beyond vague \"scannings\" and the like, basically taking a shit on the amount of effort the owner had put into characterising Thanos and properly searching for the stones.\n\nAfter they \"burst out\" over being asked to use the vent channel and to stop attempting to destroy other people's stories without permission ( an excuse you'll probably see again ), they left/got banned ( wasn't online to see ) from the server for the first time and promptly made their own and attempted to siphon members from the main server to.\n\nTheir server was shite. They attempted to constantly start up arcs without allowing other people to really interfer, taking their ideas and acting like they were their own. If anybody did take control of her ideas to work on them, they'd promptly throw a fit and abandon it. Anytime an RP did start, it didn't get anywhere due to their character needing to be the most important and badass main character. This is the only character type she knows how to write and typically their only purpose is to kill whatever \"OP\" character she doesn't like because it interferes with her plans.\n\nAfter their server died, they came back, supposedly changed. They got banned within a month for doing the same shit. This happened again after she had changed ( again ). This mostly happened due to them exploiting the compassion of one of my close friends, \"Raptor\". Raptor constantly gave them chances, as he has done for years, to change. They used these chances to moan about how much she was sorry in other servers to Raptor and to be let back into the server.\n\nAfter she joined again she became incredibly sulky over a private server a few of us had access to. When Raptor finally got her an invite she promptly left it because of petty excuses ( not being able to hijack arcs or make main character OCs ). They tried to pressure me into drinking a beer on camera when we were talking about alcohol in general just after I had got over a heavy drinking problem and continued to pressure me to do it \"for the funny\" after I pointed this out.\n\n\n\nNow we're at the present. Recently one of their friends made a spinoff server from the main one after she had been unbanned again for changing properly this time. After she joined, her character immediately began to aggressively pursue a polyamorous relationship with two other characters in a way that didn't really feel like their character and more like a character in a porn with a little plot. Their character had been portrayed so far as quiet, self-contained and secretive about everything, yet immediately began to aggressively \"suggest\" to both characters that they wanted a polyamorous relationship without any remote subtlety. This was definitely what was wanted solely by them OOC too, constantly making jokes beforehand about what would happen if she did that and not attempting to consult the owners of the characters they wanted in the relationship.\n\nRecently, the above mentioned RP had to go on hiatus due to alot of shit coming up for the owner offline. Immediately, they began to harass them over it in another server because \"they had had something one of a kind going\" with the same cookie-cutter overpowered character template she used a dozen times over. After she got called out for that in the main server she began to rant and rave ( again ) about how nobody in the server cared for her and everyone was out to get her ( despite constant efforts to include her in arcs and giving her a free hand to make her own ).\n\nTL;DR: shitty person has bad characters and cant make good plots so either hijacks others or forces them to be about their characters",

Since I want to practice and learn more the language, and also to meet other type of creative rpers.\n\nMy English level isn't perfect but I try my best to make it understandable. \n\nI have found that most people are looking for people who have an advanced grasp of the language. Is there people who are willing to give oportunities for those who aren't as proficient at writing?\n\nAlso, any advice?",

I\u2019ve been looking for a Witcher RP for the past 5 days and literally every single person has just simply ghosted once it got the the point to write bios. Like, if you think our writing styles aren\u2019t compatible that\u2019s fine, but just say something beforehand. Worst was tonight where I spent a long ass time finding face claims and walking this person through the lore and writing an entire fucking bio only to realise they had ghosted me 30 minutes prior. Like what the fuck? Could you not have said anything before blocking me across all platforms? Way to waste my time and energy, goddamn. This is straight up always been such a big problem, especially in advanced lit rp, that makes me not want to rp anymore because I don\u2019t want to expend the energy to write all this shit only for the other person to just ghost.",
