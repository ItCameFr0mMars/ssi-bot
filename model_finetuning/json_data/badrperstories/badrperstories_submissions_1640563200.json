            "selftext": "Hi rp world! Unfortunately my first ever Reddit post is a bit of a downer\u2026\n\nI stumbled upon roleplaying about a year and a few months ago and probably haven\u2019t had a day without it since. (I roleplay on discord and strictly a certain anime). I found a partner that I mainly roleplay with and a few others that I hop aus with here and there. I have adhd and up until this point I haven\u2019t had such a hard time feeling motivated to roleplay. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a lack of interest in a VERY long running two person I\u2019m doing with my main partner, or if I just have too much on my plate right now and can\u2019t focus. \n\nMy long running partner also happens to be my significant other that lives over an ocean apart. We treat roleplay as a sort of bonding time but we are definitely capable of being together without it. We just wouldn\u2019t be interacting as often as we do without it. I started roleplaying during the time of covid when my life wasn\u2019t as active and I had to build a social circle somehow. I found roleplay and I genuinely enjoyed it but I find it hard to multi task with college and spending time doing other things. My partner has noticed that I just don\u2019t have a spark when I write and end up giving dry responses. I\u2019m going to try harder to be engaged but part of me feels like it won\u2019t be enough. \n\nHas anyone felt similarly? Have they gotten through it or have advice?",

            "selftext": "Quite some time ago I met this guy on the old roleplay app called Geeking before it was shut down. When the app was shut down,I lost contact with him. Plus I barely remember talking with this guy. \nWell a few months later, we found each other on a roleplay search discord and reconnected. He said he remembered me from geeking and wanted to roleplay to which I agreed. \nThe roleplays we could only agree on was either Creepypasta or Overwatch. (I only roelplay in fandoms since the worlds are a comfort zone to me personally. And I've had bad experiences with original plots outside of fandoms that I never want to get into again.)\nSo the first one was a creepypasta oc. He made a whole like contract that I had to agree to. Pretty much agreeing to how I need to worship his characters that have unrealistic genital proportions and to never ghost or leave home. There was more that I didn't even bother with because it was ridiculous. At that time, I didn't have any Roleplay Partners so I just agree and went along with it. \n\nWe made a plot and we showed our characters. His was like an overly muscled big guy and went into real of the exact size of the character's genitals. \nMy character was imperfect perfection for me. She shared some realistic issues I had in real life. I didn't want to over do a mentally ill character as done so much in the Creepypasta verse. Her body type wasn't perfect but to me it was. He didn't like that. He wanted her to have big breasts and a big ass with a small waist. Which made me insecure since her body type was a bit chubby and slightly based off of mine. \n\nI just went with it because at the time, I didn't know how to set boundariesand was a major people pleaser. We started the RP and immediately, his character was bragging about these big wars he went into as well as how his character was kidnapped and SA because of how perfect his character's body was. It made it hard for me to respond since his responses didn't give me enough to work with. \nI really was uncomfortable but kept going because he bugged me. \nHe forced a plot we didn't speak about, saying our characters knew each other which rushed a sex scene almost immediately since it was supposed to be some sorta hate sex thing. I was really uncomfortable since he kept asking that my responses needed to include details of how my character thought of how hot his looked and such. \nI gave him paragraphs about his own character and a little of mine, which he would ask to be layered because it didn't fit the scene to what he imagined. \n\nAnd what made me uncomfortable was the rushed scenes. Since my character is demisexual and doesn't trust very easy especially with encounters like what was happening. Which later I learned it was practically SA to my oc. And let me tell you, I got hella emotional since my characters are like my children and share some of my personal experiences. Which really showed that he was the type of guy to not care about someone's mental health and experiences. \nThe scene even included and unplanned voyeurism sorta things where a Creepypasta character was like tried up and looked in the closet. And he would go into detail about how the character was sexually aroused to how his own character was doing mine so perfectly or what not. He even forced my to have y character verbally tell him details about how good his was in doing the deed. \n\nLater I stopped responding for a while and he did too. Then got back to me to start another rp in which I was to play multiple girls for his character. Which I agreed and hated. \nReminder, this was at a time that I didn't know how to set boundaries. \nThis whole weird to thing happened on and off before I realized his sick intent and how extremely disgusting he was. \nSo I started with complaining about how I couldn't stand his character's bragging and how the roleplay was extremely one sided. He ignored my claims and I started to ignore his messages and soon blocked him. \n\nIt's a relief that I don't talk to him but it's ruined ever wanting to do some OCxOC sorta roleplays. I still do them but I don't do it all the time. \nIn my experience of roleplaying, I've dealt with so much one sided shit. I refuse doubling Canon characters because that becomes one sided and my character is cast aside while the person gets main focus with their love interest. I've grown a dislike for like the shy UWU character traits since it means making a one sided plot for all attention to their character. As well as portraying a Dom role to people that have their characters be pillow prince or princesses which means I do all the work while they just lay there and 'take it'. I'm very uncomfortable with that if you ask me. \n\nThere's more shitty people I can share about my Roleplay experiences. But what I have learned was how to create boundaries and how to try creating an environment where both my future roleplay partners and I can have fun and have our ideas and needs in the Roleplay. \n\nThat's it for my vent for now. I might share more stories in the future.",

One actually said \"Well, I don't celebrate it\"...I suppose this is the penalty for playing an internet game with the unknown.

I've started to notice in the past one to two years that I've been a lot more hurt by some of the stuff that happens in the roleplay. Even something as small as my favourite character being ignored can make me feel depressed, and I can even start crying. I cry easily anyway, but I feel like it's not normal. I don't really have a life outside the roleplay anyway, and I constantly worry about my friend one day deciding they don't want to do it and stop replying. It's got to the point where I'll even think about killing myself if that ever happened. I know it's so dramatic, and not healthy and I've never shared this with the other person, or anyone in my life. No one even knows I roleplay aside from my partner. I want to be a writer so I should be able to handle these sort of things but I can't. I've had a lot of trauma in my life when I was a kid and I think I'm searching for an escape because I'm depressed, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do about it. I know maybe I should distance myself but I don't have anything else that I want to do with my time, and I feel like the characters I'm playing are more real than I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is really stupid and probably won't get any replies.

            "selftext": "It\u2019s a long one! \n\nI was in a group for several months and was highly disliked by the owner of the server and the staff. Is wasn\u2019t like I did anything wrong in particular, since I wasn\u2019t banned from the server (not that they didn\u2019t want to, but had no reason). I can usually deal with situations like this and understand that it\u2019s impossible to be generally liked by everyone. I\u2018m not an idiot or naive to think such things. \n\nHowever what I can\u2019t stand is being bullied and that\u2019s exactly what happened. Nothing was ever good enough for them, while their own standards are mediocre at max. It all really started to spiral down as I filler out a character from the wanted section. I spend hours on that character, but not before I asked if I need anything to know or consider, but the owner said I can do whatever I want, giving me free range. So I did, making the best sheet I ever have done, even though my sheets are usually not the best I've to admit. But this time it was different. \n\nI presented my character. I know there would be problems with that, since I never could do anything right and nothing was ever enough for them. But I was compliant and listened what they had to say, regardless of how unreasonable it was. This time they had a problem without history, said it didn\u2019t make sense and my character had to be from an organization which didn\u2019t even exist in the lore. They acted like I should have already known that the character was supposed to be from a organization, even though they just came up with that idea just right there and then. 'Because everything else wouldn\u2019t make sense\u2019 I assume? So I spend literally months of creating one. My first draft was obviously not good enough, so I rewrite the whole thing. If they didn\u2019t like the idea, they should have said before they starting to rip my idea apart.\n\nMy life is pretty messy right now, but I managed to surpass my own goal with this paper. I usually really critical about my work due to low self esteem but this time I knew my work, this document was good. But to be sure, I showed it to a friend who had a degree in English to look over the submission for my character and the organization, I let other\u2019s proof read it just to be sure. \n\nYou can imagine that as soon as I submitted it. The nip picking started while their own work or sheets of other\u2019s which wasn\u2019t half as detailed and long as mine got accepted immediately. They even had the nerve to correct minor grammatical mistakes, which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they wouldn\u2019t make worst one in their tags (missing letters and repeating words in one sentence. Like seriously, 'already ready' sounds stupid). \n\nThey made comments on my document, I had to add them as commenters on my google doc document, I changed everything they wanted, even though it was absolutely unfair. Expand on that, use another word on that. Nothing really from substance, I'm afraid. There is a difference between trying to help someone and trying to wear them down. The owner acted dumb to make me look dumb or she truly had no real imagination, since she asked the most obvious question and I had to justify it just for the sake of it. \n\nThis nip picking continued for months about the stupidest things ever, but yesterday I just gave them a piece of mind and told them how they\u2019re really are before I left the server for good. Seriously, screw communities like that. It should be that we uplift each other and improve our writing style, not killing the love for writing all together by bullying and tearing down. And that what happened. I\u2019m serious considering to give up that hobby, because I just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with that kind of stuff anymore. \n\nThanks for reading. I know it was a bit vague yet long at the same time, but I could go in more details. But honestly I\u2019m just annoyed and angry at this point. All that work, time and energy just wasted. I loved the story and my characters.",

Now you can call me weird or douchey for thinking like this but roleplaying is something where if you don\u2019t feel comfortable, it\u2019s just hard to continue doing it and of the things that makes me super uncomfortable when it comes to romance RPs particularly, one of them is if my partner is a dude OOC. I have no problem if we\u2019re doing a friendship RP - I couldn\u2019t care less about gender then, but for romance RPs...it just makes me feel weird. Back when I used to still do MxM RPs (I quit after realizing it wasn\u2019t really for me), I felt uncomfortable if my partner was female, so it has absolutely nothing to do with me being homophobic (for the record, I\u2019m trans). I know there\u2019s a lot of complexity surrounding the issue and I just want to know if there\u2019s any way I can word my preference properly without sounding like a total douchebag. Any advice is appreciated but please don\u2019t try and tell me I\u2019m unreasonable for caring about OOC gender - I have no control over what makes me uncomfortable. Thanks chaps!",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, I just need to vent! So this morning I made a post on [r/RoleplayPartnerSearch](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/) ([https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/rpa7bk/m4a\\_preferably\\_f\\_lord\\_of\\_the\\_ringsmiddleearth\\_rp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/rpa7bk/m4a_preferably_f_lord_of_the_ringsmiddleearth_rp/)) about a few ideas I had for a LOTR/Middle-Earth RP I've wanted to do for a while. I posted it to the sub and waited for the fish to bite, so to speak. \n\nAfter a while, a nice woman DMed me asking about it, and she seemed very excited too! I messaged back saying that I was glad to hear that she liked my ideas, and she asked to move to Discord. I sent my Discord and had a snoop on her profile while I waited for her to send the friend request.\n\nAnd everything was kosher. Her profile was very pink and cutesy, but that's fine, it was actually kinda charming! And as I snooped I saw she had loads of posts about Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire the Masquerade! \"Maybe she'll be down for a Cyberpunk RP? Or even World of Darkness!?\" I thought \"That'd be fun! I'd be super down for that! I wonder what else she's into? Star Wars? The Witcher? GoT? Maybe she'd like to do other settings too? That'd be fun!\" my little brain was a-buzz with possibilities of all the fun stories we could tell!\n\nThen, a notification popped up: *BlanketyBlankBlank has sent you a friend request*. I accepted posthaste and our convo began:\n\n*Me: Hi! How are you? You hear for the LOTR thing, or the bathing in sulfuric acid while blasting death metal thing?*\n\n*Her: LOL! I said LOTR didn't I?*\n\n*Me: Really? I thought you wanted to have a death metal acid bath? But seriously I'm down for LOTR!*\n\nSeveral hours pass with no reply and she responds with:\n\n*Her: LOL! You down with a LOTR game that centres around more erotic situations/an erotic quest?*\n\n*Me: Oh... No, thank you! I'd prefer a more pure LOTR experience.*\n\n*Her: A simple no would suffice. Goodnight. Good luck with the sulfuric acid.*\n\nUnfriended, because of course! I wrote in the original post I put: \" I like dark themes, but I'm ***NOT*** here to write creepy fetish pornography with freaks on the internet!\" why do the fetish people ***NEVER*** and then get upset at ***YOU***  for not wanting to do weird fetish stuff? Why?!\n\nThe thing is if she just said something like \"Okay! Sorry! Maybe we can do something else?\" I probably would have RPed with her provided she kept that stuff out of my DMs. Such a shame! And she seemed really cool too!\n\nWhy is it always the cool ones that let you down the most?",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm new to this sub so I am glad to see others have issues like I do....well did at least.\n\nI RPed a long time ago, back in the early 2000s. Celeb RP mainly on Livejournal, Greatestjournal, Insanejournal and so on. Recently I was feeling very nostalgic and was going through my external hard drive and I came across my old RP AIM Chat logs. I forgot I had saved them but man am I glad I did. Some of it was very cringy but a lot of it wasn't so bad. It made me really miss RPing. So I decided to give it a try again.\n\nNot knowing where to really start, I returned to my old stomping grounds of Insanejournal and saw the celeb rp scene on there was still pretty active. Not what it used to be, but it was a start. I have an idea for a PSL I would love to try, sort of playing out a '10+ years later' of a old pairing I used to love. I posted in the ads to see if, on the long shot, anyone would be interested. It took a bit, but I got a message and I was super excited. We talked OOC for a bit, I told them my idea, we agreed on what we were and weren't comfortable with and so on. Then they asked if I used to ask to play my character years ago. I let them know that I did. Then they started flipping out on me and listing all of the characters they used to play and how they used to always want a SL with me. I got a little freaked out because this person and I had SLs a few times and they were always terrible. They would freak out if things didn't go their way, their characters were borderline obsessive, they would stop responding randomly, harass you OOC...it was bad.\n\nNeedless to say I have ended things with them in the nicest way I could and blocked them. I feel bad but I don't want to deal with their drama after all these years.\n\nBut if anyone can help a girl out in places to look, it would be greatly appreciated!",

I am currently using Reddit, Tumblr, and Discord and I am not having very much luck. Specifically with finding a certain fandom I like to roleplay. So, does anyone have any suggestions! I know that some fandoms just aren't as popular in the community as others. I just feel kinda weird posting multiple searches and not finding anyone at all that's interested.",

            "selftext": "Thought I'd get this off my chest before the new year since this is one of the few occasions where a ghost really bothered me. It happened about a month or two ago, I might've mentioned it a little bit before, but not the specifics. For me, this is the second time I've dealt with someone like this and it's very annoying. They're essentially the biggest time wasters and it's infuriating, but in small communities, eventually, they become identifiable and go into hiding on some other account. \n\nI can't remember the exact details - but essentially this person disliked being pestered and made it apparent they have a life outside of roleplay so it might take them some time to respond, but they'll make the effort to stay engaged. That was right up my alley because I'm a bit of a slow poster, also got a life, and I dislike pestering people, so I'm never gonna bother them anyway. They said they were a bit selective and required a sample, so I sent in a writing sample as required, they liked it and we moved onto the plot.\n\nThey sounded very excited when we were plotting and together we came up with a very original idea about including some sort of fake messenger app in the roleplay. So, I asked if I could try something and make a \"messenger app\" with some boarders and such to separate it from the rest of the text (think of it like a phone screen). If they didn't like it, we didn't have to continue with it. I thought it was a pretty neat idea and they were very onboard with the idea too, I was pretty excited because it'd been awhile since I had done anything this original. I added gifs, links to pictures, etc. (typical things for the community I was in). They said they couldn't wait for my response.\n\nBy the time I replied (Which was pretty quick since I got pretty hyped about this plot), I got a message immediately that they loved my reply and would respond by tomorrow since it was late at night. They never responded and the hype slowly died. I waited maybe 3 or 4 weeks to message them about it,  hoping they weren't ghosting, and around a week later they deleted their account. Since I'm self-conscious, apart me had to wonder \"Is it because I was bothering them?\" or \"Did they not like the reply?\" which is honestly more infuriating because of the blatant lying after I put so much effort into making a reply. This really bummed me out because I was really proud of this starter. About four paragraphs wasted (not including the fake chat) and would only have future use as a writing sample.\n\nAnyway, this person was into two fandoms, so they were easily recognizable. I noticed an account advertising for two specific fandoms again weeks later and had my suspicions, and upon a little further investigation it was definitely the same person. Same requirements about how they're busy, dislike being messaged a lot, etc. Maybe 2 people took the bait and they disappeared again only to reappear late December doing the same exact thing. \n\nI seriously don't get why people do this repeatedly. There's flakers that join your roleplays than there are flakers that advertise roleplays - and in my opinion, the latter feels much worse. Especially when all that hype amounts to nothing but self-doubt.",
