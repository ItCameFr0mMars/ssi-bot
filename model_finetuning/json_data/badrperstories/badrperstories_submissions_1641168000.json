            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm posting this on a throwaway account mostly because I usually just observe this forum without an account and also because I prefer to remain anonymous.\n\nAnyway, as you can probably guess from the title, I've decided to just retire from roleplaying. It's mostly my fault that I'm retiring anyway, though I guess you could also somewhat blame the current environment surrounding roleplay but that is stretching it.\n\nI always found that majority of the time, I can't keep up with the majority of the people when it comes to roleplaying. I usually get ghosted and sure I try not to take it personally but when you see said person complaining that there aren't any good roleplayers or you see someone post on their profile that they don't want mediocre roleplay it's kinda demoralizing. It's even more demoralizing when it's the people you've roleplayed with before. I just find myself getting more demoralized the more I look at the people around me looking for partners. I can't even keep up with the basic requirements either and I can't even force myself to improve because I only seem to improve by extremely small amounts. It's damaging to my self-esteem to know that I'm just not good enough anymore. I feel guilty even approaching someone with the idea of roleplaying because I know that I'm probably wasting their time. It doesn't help that it usually ends after a few short posts (With my shortest record being just me posting once and then they dip immediately).\n\nThis isn't the first time I've felt demoralized of course. I only kept going with roleplaying because it's something I genuinely enjoyed and I kept going with the false hope that I'll eventually improve enough to keep up with the others. I tried to convince myself again today to keep going but at this point, the truth is right in my face. I've probably already reached my limit of how much I can improve. I've come to realize that I probably don't have a place in this entire roleplay community anymore.\n\nAnyway, that's it for me I guess. Thanks for the happy memories, I'll try not to forget them.",

We've built entire societies between us, and in that process, several of my characters have undergone massive character arcs. They've made mistakes, suffered consequences, then come out on the other side as better people. However, my partner's characters have not done the same. \n\nI used to think the refusal to change was part of a slower buildup, but that's not the case. The characters are just more reactive than proactive. Now that I know this, my motivation is flagging.\n\nI'm thinking of calling it quits, but after we've both sunk so much time and effort into the RP, I want to do right by my partner.\n\nWhat's a good way to bring this up? Characters are often intensely personal for RPers, and as much as I can, I want to avoid the topic feeling personal. \n\nAt the same time, if this is a style difference we can't reconcile, are there any tips for ending plans prematurely?",

            "selftext": "Okay so some names changed and detail left out to keep it anonymous obviously. So I\u2019m in this H20 rp, you know mermaids and stuff. I only put this here so you can have the context of how what exactly this situation is going down in. Okay? Okay. Basically slice of life.\n\nSo I have this character named Shianne, my \u201c friend \u201c ( I put this is quotes because most of the time this person tests my will not to just block them even if we joined this server together ), Margo has a character named Fiona okay cool.\n\nSo Shianne has been through some, pretty heavy shit considering she is only a teenager ( friends dying, even finding one dying and holding their hand until they pass, friends leaving, her crush getting with someone new and are now even talking about marriage ( I think it\u2019s stupid too but, crush is 19 so I guess whatever ) etc. ) so obviously she shuts off. Because who would not? It\u2019s a surprise she hasn\u2019t had a nervous breakdown but in any case. \n\nFiona had something pretty terrible happen to her too. She tells Shianne, Shianne is the ONLY one in the rp to be there for her through this because everyone else didn\u2019t know Fiona Or didn\u2019t care right? Okay. So all this stuff starts happing to Shianne by proxy as plots start happening and things go to hell. And mind you none of this that happened is long after what Fiona just went through. Hell some of it even happened AT THE SAME TIME. Okay. \n\nSo Shianne, like what I ASSUMED would be a normal response, decides not to tell Fiona of any of the stuff that happened ( as none of it had to deal with Fiona anyways ). Because, in Shianne\u2019s mind \u201c why would I tell her any of this stuff when she is literally still recovering. \u201c, that\u2019s like a number 1 red flag of your using you friend as a therapist. Or again, so I assumed. \n\nI get a text off the site from Margo going \u201c so Shianne is just gonna be a bitch to her friend okay lol \u201c so, I\u2019m confused and go \u201c \u2026..what? \u201c and she goes on to say that Shianne is heartless because she didn\u2019t tell Fiona what was bothering her. I go \u201c ummmm okay but\u2026 \u201c and explained what I just explained about how Fiona doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s in the space to be taking anymore baggage that is not her own. Margo goes \u201c Fiona wouldn\u2019t have mind. \u201c \u2026.well okay that\u2019s great now I THE PLAYER know that, but, why would my character just. Know that? \u201c Have she ever told her that? That she could just trauma dump on her like that? \u201c \u201c No. But it\u2019s kinda just to be assumed since they\u2019re supposed be friends. \u201c oh no hun that\u2019s not\u2026. \n\nSo. Margo tells me that Fiona now all but hates Shianne and there is nothing I can do about it which. At first I just kinda was like \u2018 yeah that is my Ocs bad I guess I\u2019ll take it. \u2018 but then I kept thinking about it and. No? \n\nSo yes Shianne did not tell Fiona her troubles ( or that she is a mermaid either but that\u2019s not the most important ) and yeah that\u2019s pretty shit but the more I thought about it. Fiona never ASKED Shianne what was wrong either and they are supposed to be friends. She just took Shianne\u2019s literal depressive episode as \u201c teehee she hates me time to drop her \u201c and I was like and I\u2019M the one solely in the wrong? \n\nAnd also Fiona never told Shianne about what happen to her. Shianne had to find out from someone else and practically claw it out of her. And not only comfort Fiona but also lay there with her while she cried and agreed to not talk about it. ANOTHER thing Shianne had to carry while Fiona just gets a free pass to be in lala land like lol \n\nAnd so I guess I\u2019m looking to see if maybe it\u2019s me? I know the post in written in a way that makes it sound like I\u2019m trying to rally for my side but I\u2019m really not. It\u2019s me more so venting my frustrations from my POV. I\u2019m very open to being told that maybe I\u2019m in the wrong for this one and maybe Shianne is a bitch idk I\u2019m just. \n\nI wish this season of \u201c Days of our lives: Under Water \u201c would have got canceled after the 5th episode. \n\nBonus round: Margo parading around the ooc saying Shianne is awful to which people and myself will come to the defense like \u2018 well not exactly it sounds to me like Shianne needs like a hug and support \u2018 and all Margo can ever think to say is \u2018 yeah I guess lol \u2018 so.",

            "selftext": "One of those days, you know? \n\nI have a good partner. I am active in a good group of writers. I like our little circle. \n\nBut sometimes I wake up feeling left out, even though I have a fair number of threads between everyone. Sometimes I feel unwanted, even though lots of them chat with me OOC on top of doing IC stuff. Sometimes it feels, in my head, like everyone's probably just tolerating me on the side while they actually prefer one another. Like if I just quit writing, nobody would mind, because I'm their last preference anyway, and I'd be doing them a favor to spare them a tag on their to-do list.\n\nAnd on those days, every tiny little aside someone has made stands out to me and runs on endless repeat. Every good-humored joke made about one of my characters suddenly seems like it wasn't really a joke. Every time one of them decided to skip the tag they owed me and tag each other instead feels less like \"haha we all have those days where muse is stronger for one scene in particular!\" and more like \"nah I probably just suck\" instead. \n\nIs it accurate? Almost definitely not. So I can't really say it out loud to any of them, because that would just be a really unfair drag on their energy to perk me up and reassure me that no, we really are friends, and no, they really do like my characters and our threads and blah blah blah ...\n\nBut man, these days really are bummer days.",

            "selftext": "Story time!  \n\n\nOkay, so two things for context.   \n1) Server's got a welcome channel where you can only sit in it for 1 day before you're removed. You have to do a soft age check to get access to the rest of the server. That channel exists solely to welcome people and verify they're over 18.   \n2) We don't accept links for our application. We used to allow for google docs, but I personally find it's easier to scroll when it's all in the server. Most of our applications require 2-3 posts to get everything out, sometimes more. Not a big deal  \n\n\nAlrighty, so this guy joined earlyish in the morning yesterday. He was on the older side, so the other Admin and I were just joking and vibing, being friendly, answering his questions. No biggie. He kept asking questions and trying to brainstorm in that channel, other admin mentioned the age check. The guy kept on with his questions. I answered a few more, then brought up the age check again. He seemed to ignore that, and he went along with his questions. I humoured him because he mentioned being a friend of a player who is a known sweetheart. I know that when players bring in their friends, it's because they're vouching for the server so I try to be extra accommodating.   \n\n\nLater in the night, he's still not done his age check. We've gotten a handful of other people in and looking around. They've done the age check during his conversation. I, again, prompt him for the age check. He, again, just keeps asking questions. I answer them and then I said \"I'm sorry, but I do need to express a boundary here. I would love to answer your questions in the appropriate channel, but I do need to insist that you perform the age check. I do not appreciate being ignored so many times.\"  \n\n\nHe said \"wait, what????\"   \n\n\nI copy and paste the two times that I've prompted him along with the time that the other Admin did as well. I tell him I will not be answering more questions until he's verified he's over 18. At this point, he's mentioned that he's 42, but the age check is specifically in MM/YY format and we do this as part of the application process to see how well people can take directions.   \n\n\nHe says \"okay. We lets do the ag check. Since you feel ignored.\"   \n\n\nI didn't best appreciate the tone, but I readily admit that English isn't my first language. Sometimes I register a tone that's not there. I wait a bit. Nothing happens. I say \"whenever you're ready, sir.\" I specifically include the \"sir,\" out of respect because it was conveyed to me that he and the player who brought him in know one another from Gor RP. In this case, he identified as a Dominant. Even if he's not *my* dominant, I still wanted to show respect. Finally he gives a form of the age check, but it's his full birthday.   \n\n\nOkie dokie. I give him the correct roles and move into the OOC chat to welcome him and link the questions channel. Before I can, he says something about how he worried he'd need to take out his ID. I reiterated that, as the welcome channel says, we just needed the month and year of his birth to verify. He makes a comment about how I just went \"Mrs. Davelle on him\" which I didn't understand.   \n\n\n I asked \"Pardon?\"  \nAnother player chimed in saying he guessed that the guy was likening me to Cruella.   \nConfused, I answer \"I-... what?\"   \n\n\nHe then says that despite him being friendly and polite, I was a \"sourpuss\" and \"mannerisms are lacking. On your part.\"   \n\n\nAs I'm trying to figure out if he means manners or if he's just saying I am somehow lacking in mannerisms, other players chime in. One tells him to simmer down, another just says \"bruh\" and then the friend who brought him in starts chiming in telling him that's enough. He says \"save it, I'm out.\"   \n\n\nI didn't quite know what had happened, but the player who recruited him and I both apologized. We all went about our lives. The guy came back in and apologized. I did so too, despite not feeling like I'd done anything wrong, I'm willing to let bygones be what they are. And I know that the holidays can frazzle anyone's nerves.   \n\n\nHe asks to DM me, I say sure. In DMs, I keep trying to get him to brainstorm, but he's more interested in learning about me. I mention that I grew up in southwestern Nigeria, but I'm Puerto Rican by birth. He starts lowkey fetishizing Puerto Ricans, asking if I have an accent. I mention that Americans usually think I do.   \n\n\nHe hits me with \"-doggy humps her thigh- HOT\" which is ... so gross. Then sends me a selfie. At this point, I know exactly what his type his. The sort who like to be fawned over OOC and need you to pretend they're god's gift to you while they try to initiate some type of online-ooc-sexual relationship. Ew. No thank you. Also by that point, I'd already mentioned twice that I was married.   \n\n\nFinally, I get him on task and we start brainstorming a character concept. He agrees to one, but then he keeps changing it, asking me questions about how to adapt one concept to another that makes very little sense. In addition to this, his speech pattern is VERY difficult to understand. He tended to drop random words from his sentence structures.   \n\n\nAs an example:  \nIt's be like someone who means to say \"I was just stuck in traffic for four hours, and I am in a bad mood.\" But what they actually type is \"I was traffic four. I'm bad mood.\"   \n\n\nIt was very difficult for me to follow what he was saying, when he kept jumping around from one idea to another without any context. I tried conveying that, and he got snippy with me for, I guess, implying he couldn't write? But what I said was \"I'm so sorry, can you please rephrase that? I don't quite understand what you're saying here.\" Either way, he got snippy, stopped responding, I went about my night.   \n\n\nThe following day, before I woke up, he applied his character. There were a dozen things wrong with it. We have a little code tucked away in one of our introductory channels that pairs with a question in the application to verify that applicants have read everything. Without it, we won't even look at an application. He was missing that. Then the bio has to be a minimum of 3 paragraphs long. His was three sentences. The writing sample also needs to be 3 paragraphs. He gave one sentence. His PB was of a man who is dead, which we also don't allow. The character, overall, didn't make any sense whatsoever.   \n\n\nWhen the other admin tried to walk him through what we needed, he lashed out saying that he could only type 2000 characters for his application. It was conveyed that we know, that's why you need to take up multiple posts. He refused, saying he should be allowed to put up a google doc. The application specifically says \"no links will be processed.\" It can seem tedious, we used to allow them, but it's easier for the staff in our server to have it all *in* the server. He went off on the other admin and said that we were \"archaic,\" which I was honestly shocked to read from him considering how monosyllabic he had been until that point. Then he tried to insult us for being such an \"old server, since what, 2017?\" Close. Launched in 2018 *and going strong, babyyyy ;) !* He left, and the other admin banned him, after taking screen shots for me. I personally think that's a flex, I don't know why he would imagine calling out how long we've lasted would be an insult.   \n\n\nWhen I got online, I followed up to just say \"I'm sorry it wasn't for you, but I really do hope you have a wonderful new year! I know you'll find the right place for you!\" I did this because I really didn't want him taking out his unpleasant experience on the player who had recruited him.   \n\n\nHe starts complaining to me about how archaic the system was and how much of a dick the other admin was. I told him that it's not for everyone and that's okay. He wanted to argue that it wasn't. Then he said that he's been roleplaying since '98, so he knows. What's funny about that is that he was borderline illiterate. I don't mean that in terms of \"advanced literacy = length.\" I mean that he quite literally could barely spell, ignored any known rules of grammar, struggled to articulate even the most basic concepts.  \n\n\n But as he, again, attempted to insult the other Admin, I got a little bit mean and told him \"respectfully, I do think it's important to know where your faults are. From what I have seen of you in the last 24 hours, you would not have been able to keep up with this server. We are primarily a novella storyline, and we promise all our members that anyone coming in will be able to give them a baseline of the depicted writing standard, mentioned in our how-to channel. You have shown that you cannot. You have also shown that you are incapable of accepting any accountability, so I do agree that this was not the place for you. While I do, genuinely, wish you all the best, I'm done with this conversation now. Good day.\" And then I blocked him.   \n\n\n That should be the end, but then he went into a mutual hub server and started trying to tag me, ranting and raving about what a backwards cunt I am, showing screen shots which only showed me being accommodating with him throughout the previous night up until he started slinging insults. He got banned from there too.   \n\n\nAnd the moral of the story is: *please don't hump the legs of internet strangers*.",

Oooohlordy.\n\nIt's like... he would do something that was way, way 'off', like have his character ask mine to get a tattoo of his face in an inappropriate spot. Another one was saying he was going to have his character (male) get breast implants. This wasn't all the time\u2014much of the time, things played out fine. But just as I would feel comfortable, wham! Some strange thing, usually involving body mods or tattoos.\n\nAnother thing he used to do... much of the time, he was perfectly articulate. However, there were times when he would post, and a few sentences that would be *way* misspelled or weirdly-worded. I would have to ask him what he meant, and then he would get angry with me and act like I was doing it to be rude. \n\nI finally blocked him when he *really* lost it. He started saying he wanted to have his character tattoo a black rat (yes, *Rattus rattus,* the one responsible for bubonic plague) on my character's breast. I told him as kindly as I could that I wasn't going to continue the story\u2014by this point, I had told him the body mod and tattoo stuff weren't something I was okay with. And he lost. his. entire. shit. He made some physical threats and also said things that were just unbelievably sickening to me.\n\nTo this *day* I don't know if this dude had something like substance issues or was just a troll with a long game.",

It seems every partner I've been finding, both M and F, only write about a couple sentences, which I'm sure is normal, but I always find it very hard to work with these partners and I end up leaving them.\n\nIs it unreasonable to ask for lengthier replies from RPs? I have partners who love writing vivid multi-paragraph RP replies and I've enjoyed the years I've spent with them, but it seems that advanced literate RP is dead otherwise.\n\nI understand I'm in the minority, as I write often and am accustomed to writing thicker paragraphs and adding little details and extra depth to characters and environments. Maybe I should tone it down a bit and re-evaluate where I search for partners? (Reddit and Discord.) Or is this just overall an unnecessarily large ask from a person who writes too much?\n\nAny and all feedback is welcome, as well as partner requests! If you feel you're in the same boat as me, feel free to shoot me a message and we can vibe :) Otherwise, enjoy your day!",

            "selftext": "So, I don't exactly know where I'd seek advice for this sort-of thing in any other roleplay-related subreddit, they're all geared towards advertising. This is the only one I've come across that's exclusively talking about everything like bad roleplay occurrences, roleplay advice, thou-reddit-that-sh'ant-be-named and what not. \n\nI really don't think such a thing exist, but I'm gonna shoot my shot anyway.\n\nAwhile back, I started seeing parallels with the Roleplay community's current situation and the Fanfiction community. One major thing both these communities have in common is they have *very prevalent* NSFW subcommunity ranging from straight up smut to very graphic dark-themed content and it eventually led to \"purges\" on the social medias and other platforms they were on. \n\nGiven, I'm a fandom roleplayer that started out with writing very bad fanfictions, but escalated to roleplaying fandoms at some point on popular fanfic sites. I've got an okay POV of what happened with fanfic sites that are now pretty much dead thanks to AO3's existence. Before AO3 existed, a lot of fanfic sites were purging NSFW content, as well as fanfics based on some copyrighted material (I vaguely remember the Anne Rice fiasco where there was just a total annihilation of Vampire Chronicles content). Eventually, someone got fed up with it and AO3 came into existence.\n\nThe Roleplay Community is now huger than ever and if I'm being frank, kind-of seems like it's in a bit of disarray as an actual community since people got kicked off Tumblr and wherever else. So, is there really nowhere for NSFW Roleplayers to go aside from Discord?\n\nIt could be because I started off on fanfiction sites, but I just really miss that format.",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I mean politics as in the relationship between RPers, not actual political situations we are facing in the current world, this has nothing to do with that. I'm also not saying I am perfect in this situation, I've made several mistakes that eventually ended in this current conundrum. \n\nTo start, some context. This involves a small group I am currently hosting as the GM/discord administrator. I wrote the lore, made the server, and invited the players. The individual I am having problems with was an individual with whom I've written a one-on-one RP with, but with issues surrounding his writing and character, I slowly lost interest. I only invited him because I didn't want to seem like a ghost or an asshole who cuts others off for bad characters. In hindsight, I should have just cut my losses and cut ties with this person. This is 100% my fault and I am an idiot for not doing this. \n\nThe next mistake I made was agreeing to do a prefabricated romance between his character and mine. I should have said no to him, but once again... not wanting to come off as rude... I, like the push-over that I am, said yes. This RP is set during the late middle ages, specifically during the Hundred Years War in England and France. My character is a French Countess, who inherited her title after the death of her childless older brother. His character is... a random English peasant girl. I'm not saying a romance cannot blossom from this, but I've stated explicitly that my character would never get with a peasant, no matter what and he goes off to make a peasant. Ugh. Not to mention, his writing is rather \"square\" and his characters are always super dense. These were also the reasons I stopped the one-on-one, which was also a romance between two characters that I did not enjoy as a result of a lack of a three-dimensional, complex character from him.\n\nI'm sure you're sick of reading this but... I said yes, ONCE AGAIN, to writing this ship. And as you've guessed it, I didn't want to come off as rude... I'm the type where the opinions of acquainted individuals are super important to me. Throughout the whole writing experience, it was like pulling teeth. I took my sweet time... didn't even write a lot, and was barely \"literate\". It was obvious that I wasn't into this ship at all, but I guess he never picked up on those signs. Which is fine I guess, I really should have been frank about it all. \n\nAfter writing a few scenes with him, I stopped and told him this wasn't working out for me. Predictably, he got offended and went quiet for a few days before resurfacing. I also want to say that he has several friends within this group, friends that keep the group active and are pretty loyal to him, so if he ever decides to leave, I'm going to guess that they are going to leave as well. I fear this group will not live through their departure. I'm also fairly certain he will leave if I don't do what he wants.\n\nRecently, he asked me if I would do a romance with him but with another more appropriate character. I kind of avoided his questions and was pretty ambiguous about what I want. I don't know, maybe I should keep him in this limbo so I can avoid a confrontation with him that will inevitably cause more drama. But I'm positive he will continue to pester me about it, and will eventually get pissy when he notices I am avoiding him, which will lead to more drama so I guess drama is inevitable... Should I just bite the bullet again and pray he won't write such a dense character? I also really don't like micromanaging someone's character and telling them how to write, but I fear I will start pulling my hair out if it is the same crap I've had to suffer through the last two times.\n\nThis is a real big headache for me right now and I've been getting migranes. I've thought about just removing him and his friends so I can get it over with and start over with a new community. I've even thought about disappearing completely and deleting the server... Of course, these are two extreme options that I really don't want to do but I've been casually considering them. \n\nSorry if I sound like a drama queen or if this problem has a very simple solution. I kind of just want to get away from this individual right now, but I live all the way in Poland so at least he won't hunt me down irl...",

            "selftext": "One of the reasons I don't Erp with strangers anymore.\n\nIs because most of the Erpers I would run into are those that can't distinguish rp from real life. (Non-Erpers too but it was always the erpers in my case that were the worst)\n\nHere's one of many stories I have experienced in my time of Erp with strangers and my last straw for it. \n\nNow I'm not a sole erp role-player, I do prefer story driven rps and character development as well within the rps. However I decided to be open to erping. The end of my Erp with strangers era happen when I decided to make a nsfw, erp ig account. \n\nNow I had my fair share of creeps and weirdos throughout the time that I would simply just block and such. One of the bigger issues I took notice of was how many of these creeps think the rps are real life situations...\n\nDuring that time I was with someone, a romantic partner and we were open about our relationship. We both had erp accounts, and made it clear that as admins we were taken.\n\nI had my fair share of those I rped with there that would ask if I was single OOC and when I'd say no they would just ghost me or full on block me. So I guess bullet dodged. Til the end of the time I had the account there was this one rper I kinda became friends with for a couple weeks to a month or so. During that time we would erp and casually chat. \n\nYa know like normal friends, until one day he asked if I was single. Mind you by now, I have mentioned I was taken a bunch of times through Q/As I'd post and even on some separate posts like wishing my current s/o at that time a heart felt birthday post (where everyone could see on my feed that I never removed) and how much I loved em. \n\nSo this was kind of the last straw for me because it was also not the first time I told him I wasn't single when we would first start rping. He was a regular erper with me after that though and I didn't think that rp could translate to fuck me in real life, But apperantly I was wrong!\n\nWhen I told him no he got pissed, but he was more super passive aggressive about it. He went from all \"hey how's ur day :)\" to \" just leave me the fuck alone\" like bruh, he legit was always first to message me. At this point I was done with his bs and ghosted him. (I hate ghosting people but I just couldn't handle him). \n\nHe would still come to me with his problems how his other rp acc gf broke up w him and shit so I was kinda done at that point with the account. Not only because of him but because I just wasn't interested in solely erp anymore. I ended up deleting the account and since then, whenever I make rp Rules, one of my rules, single or not, is to not flirt with me as the admin. \n\nIt's so damn uncomfy, then they go full on neckbeard because they can distinguish rp from real life. \ud83d\ude12 \n\nThose are also the people that would rp in asterisks and give one worded responses.",

It felt too far since I've dealt with family deaths and it's no laughing matter or good to make fun of a dead person to someone who was grieving. I felt like they were going a bit too far and I didn't know what to really say. \nSo I sorta ignored them and it later turned into sorta thing where they were trying to get me to talk about the bad things that happened in my life. \n\nAnd I realized it was a sorta manipulation to get me to do the plots they wanted. \nLater we decided on sharing OCs. So I shared a couple of my creepypasta ones and they pointed out one of them. I explained that most my characters share my personal past traumas and work.through them in roleplays or already have worked through them. \n\nThen they bring you this out if the blue plot. Basically saying that my creepypasta oc was going to try killing her character and it doesn't work. Like my character would be physically attacking and hurting her character. \n\nNot to mention was that they were telling me we should work with roleplays to help personal traumas and relive them out. \nI don't like what they're doing but I feel it would be rude to just leave them since it seems like they are going through something really horrible. And I want to help bit I know I personally have a hard time trying to help someone like that. \n\nIt's just all over the place and I'm feeling so lost and almost like I might be getting trapped by their guilting. Bit I also feel horrible for how I'm feeling against it. \n\nIt's just...all over the place. I need help and I don't know what to do.",

            "selftext": "Quite some time ago I met this guy on the old roleplay app called Geeking before it was shut down. When the app was shut down,I lost contact with him. Plus I barely remember talking with this guy. \nWell a few months later, we found each other on a roleplay search discord and reconnected. He said he remembered me from geeking and wanted to roleplay to which I agreed. \nThe roleplays we could only agree on was either Creepypasta or Overwatch. (I only roelplay in fandoms since the worlds are a comfort zone to me personally. And I've had bad experiences with original plots outside of fandoms that I never want to get into again.)\nSo the first one was a creepypasta oc. He made a whole like contract that I had to agree to. Pretty much agreeing to how I need to worship his characters that have unrealistic genital proportions and to never ghost or leave home. There was more that I didn't even bother with because it was ridiculous. At that time, I didn't have any Roleplay Partners so I just agree and went along with it. \n\nWe made a plot and we showed our characters. His was like an overly muscled big guy and went into real of the exact size of the character's genitals. \nMy character was imperfect perfection for me. She shared some realistic issues I had in real life. I didn't want to over do a mentally ill character as done so much in the Creepypasta verse. Her body type wasn't perfect but to me it was. He didn't like that. He wanted her to have big breasts and a big ass with a small waist. Which made me insecure since her body type was a bit chubby and slightly based off of mine. \n\nI just went with it because at the time, I didn't know how to set boundariesand was a major people pleaser. We started the RP and immediately, his character was bragging about these big wars he went into as well as how his character was kidnapped and SA because of how perfect his character's body was. It made it hard for me to respond since his responses didn't give me enough to work with. \nI really was uncomfortable but kept going because he bugged me. \nHe forced a plot we didn't speak about, saying our characters knew each other which rushed a sex scene almost immediately since it was supposed to be some sorta hate sex thing. I was really uncomfortable since he kept asking that my responses needed to include details of how my character thought of how hot his looked and such. \nI gave him paragraphs about his own character and a little of mine, which he would ask to be layered because it didn't fit the scene to what he imagined. \n\nAnd what made me uncomfortable was the rushed scenes. Since my character is demisexual and doesn't trust very easy especially with encounters like what was happening. Which later I learned it was practically SA to my oc. And let me tell you, I got hella emotional since my characters are like my children and share some of my personal experiences. Which really showed that he was the type of guy to not care about someone's mental health and experiences. \nThe scene even included and unplanned voyeurism sorta things where a Creepypasta character was like tried up and looked in the closet. And he would go into detail about how the character was sexually aroused to how his own character was doing mine so perfectly or what not. He even forced my to have y character verbally tell him details about how good his was in doing the deed. \n\nLater I stopped responding for a while and he did too. Then got back to me to start another rp in which I was to play multiple girls for his character. Which I agreed and hated. \nReminder, this was at a time that I didn't know how to set boundaries. \nThis whole weird to thing happened on and off before I realized his sick intent and how extremely disgusting he was. \nSo I started with complaining about how I couldn't stand his character's bragging and how the roleplay was extremely one sided. He ignored my claims and I started to ignore his messages and soon blocked him. \n\nIt's a relief that I don't talk to him but it's ruined ever wanting to do some OCxOC sorta roleplays. I still do them but I don't do it all the time. \nIn my experience of roleplaying, I've dealt with so much one sided shit. I refuse doubling Canon characters because that becomes one sided and my character is cast aside while the person gets main focus with their love interest. I've grown a dislike for like the shy UWU character traits since it means making a one sided plot for all attention to their character. As well as portraying a Dom role to people that have their characters be pillow prince or princesses which means I do all the work while they just lay there and 'take it'. I'm very uncomfortable with that if you ask me. \n\nThere's more shitty people I can share about my Roleplay experiences. But what I have learned was how to create boundaries and how to try creating an environment where both my future roleplay partners and I can have fun and have our ideas and needs in the Roleplay. \n\nThat's it for my vent for now. I might share more stories in the future.",

            "selftext": "*Lets begin by noting that this, of course, is just a throwaway account to discuss this particular post - if there\u2019s another subreddit which people think this would be better suited to for discussion, please let me know!*\n\nI\u2019m certainly not writing this from a \u201cwoe-is-me\u201d point of view, although I fear it may come off that way. Genuinely, I\u2019m wanting to learn so that my experiences are better. And those I *try* to RP with. But after a few months of the same issues despite different approaches, I\u2019m at a loss. \n\nI\u2019m an M, and I\u2019ve been posting on the usual subs for roughly a year now with the same or similar prompts- nothing too shocking, a realistic prompt or maybe SoL, often following a romance with healthy doses of drama and angst (just to clarify, my stories are not chasing pure-smut or anything close, not that there is anything wrong with that). Fairly boiler-plate stuff, I think. My prompts and requirements for a RP to work for me are fairly detailed - I only write on Discord, I tend to only write with people in the same timezone and I\u2019m very specific on finding a partner with a similar passion for writing length, style and level of detail. I appreciate this keeps my options fairly limited and am always okay with this. I don\u2019t get *tons* of responses to be prompts, but when I do it usually always manages to avoid anyone wanting *different* things - which is great for everyone. \n\nBecause of having a fairly specific idea of what I\u2019m looking for from a partner (without trying to limit them on how they develop their character etc.), it has always tended to be that \u201cday one\u201d is spent getting a feel for the vibe of each other, their writing style in chat, their humour, their expectations for the prompt and characters etc. My experience over the last year has been that this is fairly normal - I very rarely pair with someone instantly wanting to jump into RP without ironing out the details and making sure the \u2018fit\u2019 feels right. \n\nI\u2019ll often be in the position of having chatted for a couple of hours that evening, feeling positive about the prompt, my potential partner and our how our writing style is matching up (or at least, appears to be). Ideas will be starting to firm up, characters beginning to develop and mutual excitement for the RP seems to be. The next day, I\u2019m ghosted, without a word and without any clear indication that this would happen. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t even need to be the next day - last night, all it took was for me to be AFK for 45 minutes whilst I made dinner, and I\u2019d returned to a deleted friend on Discord. It often feels like Groundhog Day.\n\nIs my approach here causing this issue or is it just bad luck, or possibly just a reality of RP\u2019ing? I\u2019ve tried in the past to \u2018speed up\u2019 getting into the RP but for 95%+ of cases find that the fit hasn\u2019t been right due to issues which otherwise would be fleshed out in that initial chat. Any advice on how to overcome this would be great.",

            "selftext": "So, I don't necessarily feel like my partner makes me come up with \\*all\\* the ideas, but I feel like it's most of them. He never introduces new characters. And don't get me wrong, I don't need new characters all the time, but sometimes I feel like they could really, really benefit a scene (and apparently he doesn't feel that way, ha).\n\nI feel like I have to make everything 'major' happen in the roleplay, too. He never initiates any conflict or drama. It's always me having a character, major or minor, do things that lead to the next story arc, if that makes sense?\n\nBasically I feel like I'm the one carrying the story and that my partner is just...costing along on my ideas. Very rarely he'll input his own. I play just about all of the minor characters, I make all of the 'rules' for new species, new worlds, new societies, etc. I've tried to tell him before, kindly of course, 'BTW, if you've ever got ideas you want to try, that's awesome!' but he doesn't really take the bait.\n\nI haven't roleplayed with him for very long, and while I'm definitely enjoying our story, I don't think this is something I want to deal with in the long term, so I'm thinking of telling him that I'm just not feeling it anymore. Or can ya'll help me think of another way to tell him that I feel like I'm carrying too much of the weight and responsibility?",
