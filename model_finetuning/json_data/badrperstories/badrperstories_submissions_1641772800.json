            "selftext": "Is normal when some roleplays don't simply work out. I had to end various roleplays either early or late when your roleplay partner just doesn't want to follow the general plot. Now I know I usually play the role of Dungeon Master in a way. Creating the world, the ideas and so on and so forth. However I take something very seriously.\n\nFor example, on certaineras in my timeline roleplays (yes I made an entire roleplay timeline). Certain things like being emotionally sad or depressed is often seen as weakness. So in general I don't reward roleplayers who play depressed when an entire continent and maybe the world is in danger. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nPeople have better things to worry about than the people you lost. Many more will die if you don't move. So in the end I have to end their lives and give them a bad ending. Because again, no one is going to comfort them and emotional weakness is just seen as weakness. Is not unti latter in the timelines that people pay more attention. So I have to stay true to the timeline regardless of what my roleplayer feels.\n\nSome instances where people feel so entitled that I went too far with certain aspects of the roleplay also usually get booted off the roleplay since I have little time to spare for people who don't collaborate and I can always find a replacement. Getting rid of people in sections is something I do when people don't get in line. Your decision led you to that point. If your character is stubborn they suffer. Is a simple concept, don't try and pin that on me.\n\nFinally and this once happened. Some people confuse my tone as rude and while I understand why some people see that especially in the roleplay. Is less me being rude and more just being realistic. I won't play kind when you make a mistake. This goes double when I'm introducing characters to your main character. One of the things I enjoy doing in roleplays are character interactions. Which I consider to be somewhat wholesome.\n\nThe more you interact with these characters, the more you learn and the more you see their views and so on. I do that a lot and I potray many different personalities of mine on these characters at times. Is just something I do and enjoy a lot in making characters. However some just want to skip that and characters are half the fun. They even said I could just skip these interactions but I don't. These interactions are very important, not for story but for you as the roleplay partner to get closer to these characters.\n\nHowever all of that defeated when they just chop it down to rudeness and I'm like \"Alright, you think I'm rude, fine. Have a block and I'll just find someone else to take your place.\" Some people don't really get it. I might be cold and blunt at times but I really hate certain additudes that quickly get on my nerves. These people never make it out of the start. Sensitivity is just something I don't tolerate in my roleplays. Me personally anyways.",

            "selftext": "So, this is a long story but I'll try to keep it as short as I can. There's just a lot here. This happened on a jcink site rp and very recently. When I joined the site, which a few friends who I've been rping with for years, created, I began talking to a new member. They seemed fine at first but red flags kept popping up all over the place as I continued talking to them. I will call this person R. I stood up for this person and kept them from being banned when they really should have been banned because I wasn't seeing the problems a few others were before I did. \n\nAs R and I continued talking I began to realize that they were being manipulative. R would send me screenshots of their conversations with other people and complain about what they were saying and doing. R would tell me about fabricated past grievances with other rpers and try to convince me they were awful people and I shouldn't thread with them. Any ships I began plotting with other people, especially if it involved a male character being shipped to a female, R would try and convince me the other rper and character wouldn't be able to give my character what they want and need and that they would be better off in a gay ship than a straight one. \n\nNow, keep in mind, I am gay myself and I do gay and straight ships so I'm not bringing this up to complain about them wanting gay ships. This is about manipulation and coercion they were trying to do. R dragged me into drama they were having with the person they were dating, someone that was also on the site. They ruined a relationship with I had with another rper, put a wedge between us and convinced me to stop rping or speaking with this person and that their behavior was toxic. R tried to ruin another relationship with another rper and get me to do the same to them so I would only rp and ship with R but I caught onto what they were doing. R told me lies about what the second person did on previous sites when it turns out that R had stalked and harassed this person on multiple platforms and did similar things to a previous rp partner of this person by manipulating them to leave all plots and ships to only plot and ship with R. \n\nI decided to confront R about everything but did so in a nice way. I tried not to be overly accusing and just told them what I was noticing. R immediately responded by telling me they 'had their reasons', deleted our private discord server and left the site. I dmed them for clarification that they didn't even want to talk about it and were just going to up and leave. R wanted to have the last word so they left me a message saying they didn't want to be criticized and that I didn't know the other rpers and R for that matter and told me I would 'find out soon enough, leaving me with a last threat. A few days later and R hacked into the site and began deleting boards. Very clearly guilty of everything I confronted them about, leaving abruptly the second they were called out on and coming back to try and ruin the site. A very vile and nasty person. \n\nOn the chance that they should see this, there are two people, twins, R took to their own site from this site, likely manipulating them into leaving. I'll call them W and RO. These two left the site, claiming they were too busy for site rps but I figured out why they really left. They blocked at least one person I know of from discord and I highly doubt they'll accept any friend requests from anyone on the site. To these people, if you happen across this, I hope you take what I've said into consideration. I too fell for R's manipulation and don't blame you for believing whatever lies R has told you about anyone on site. \n\nIf you do read this and have figured out you are who I'm talking about and would like to hear the full story, you know my discord contact info. I'll call myself V. If you don't believe anything I've said here and would rather believe R, I have a feeling you'll find out soon just what kind of person R is. And when you do figure it out, those of us still on site would be willing to welcome you back on. None of us have any or have had any problems with you, some of us are disappointed or even hurt that you left suddenly and out of the blue blocked us.",

I'm asking if there are any websites/apps that I can use where there's active roleplaying communities because while Amino (the main app that I've been using for roleplaying since late 2017/early 2018) is a good app for roleplaying and making friends, as an app overall, it's horrible. It's janky, lags a lot, sometimes chat notifications don't pop up and you accidentally ghost whoever you were talking to, and you can't go 5 minutes without the app crashing or an internal server error. It clearly tries to emulate what made apps like Instagram popular, but it fails... miserably. I could always try Reddit, but even if I do find a good roleplaying subreddit with a decent amount of members, it's probably one that focuses on ERP or has strict rules (not naming any subs in particular). While I'm not opposed to ERP (well.... as long as it's more story-driven. I don't wanna write a bad porno), a lot of the posts on those subs focus ONLY on the smut, and I wanna focus on the story and leave the smut for when our characters are comfortable with each other/when it's necessary in the story (which is not right when the roleplay begins).\n\nSo I just wanna know if there are any better alternatives if you know any. Discord servers would be helpful as well",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m really done chasing plots with people. I think I\u2019ve reached my limit and am setting my boundary. For context, I roleplay on jcink forums and discord is used as a hang out and plotting place \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be the new person in a group so I\u2019m very into reaching out to new people and seeing how they like the board, if they need any help etc. \n\nSo I reached out to this new person who had their character approved about a week earlier and only had a single messaging thread so far. We will call them W. I messaged W and asked how they were enjoying the site, they said they found it a little intimidating to try and break into the group but they liked it so far. I asked if they wanted to write together and they said yes. I offered to plot with W and sent them about a two paragraph note on how our characters could know each other and interact and their potential relationship as enemies etc. I also mentioned that I was going on break at work and would be napping for the next hour so if I was a bit slow on replying. \n\nI didn\u2019t get a reply for awhile so about 4ish the next day I messaged them again just like \u2018hey let me know when you\u2019re down to Work out a plot. They messaged me right away saying they were free now and told me about a new face claim they wanted to use. I was like okay, cool. What did you think about my suggestion above?\n\n\u201cYeah our characters could definitely be enemies.\u201d Alright. So how should we get this going? \u201cI\u2019m down for whatever.\u201d Do you have any thoughts on the plot or threads? \u201cNo.\u201d With an emoji. \n\nSo I never answered and just like, let it go because I don\u2019t have the energy for one sided plotting. A few days later I put a request in the plotting channel to see if anyone wanted to do some headcanons because I had a lot of muse but couldn\u2019t dedicate the attention/time to write out a full post while work was busy. \n\nSomeone DM\u2019d saying they wanted to headcanon. I sent them a few between our characters. Silence. It was late in their time zone so I was like maybe they fell asleep? When I saw them online about 12 hours later I messaged them and was like \u201cso hey, what did you think about the headcanons?\u201d And they said they liked them and nothing further so I\u2019m like \u201cdo you have any headcanons for A and B?\u201dand they said \u201cno, I\u2019ll try to think some up at work.\u201d \n\nAaaargh Then why did you message me saying you wanted to create some headcanons?? The point of headcanoning is to develop your characters in quick fun little ways, talk about their relationships etc \n\nIs it me? Am I going about this the wrong way? I\u2019m absolutely done trying to plot with people who want a plot written for them instead of collaboration.",

This happened once, maybe twice with me but that happened way back when I was in Google + back when it was still a social media outlet.\n\nNow back in those days most of my roleplays were battle roleplays and rather unfair ones to Godly standards and at the time I was very oblivious to the term \"God Modding\" but I played with one guy who's account was \"Ben Drowned\". Him and I roleplayed a lot back in the day and I mean a lot. While most of our roleplays were simple they were fun and eventually spawned so many different ideas, characters and so on that I still use today.\n\nWhile some ideas were scrapped like \"God Hunters\" and \"Death Sentence\" and for good reason. These two things have their own simple yet neat lore but their whole outlet is on a different scale and on the roleplays I do now they just don't fit. The only ones that only fitted once was the God Hunters on a roleplay called \"Eternal Heroes\" but that's due to the direction that roleplay took with the whole multiverse thing. So I took my roleplayer to my multiverse and the many stories in those worlds. \n\nThey were a lot of fun. Is a little sad in a way that many ideas I used to have back in the day have to either be scrapped or nerf in the roleplays I do now in days. Will they ever have a return? I don't know. However I do know one thing, they were the good old days in my roleplay years. I might have sucked in descriptive roleplay back then but I am definitely much better in roleplays now than back then. We all start somewhere.\n\nWhy don't you tell me your best roleplayer back in the day?",

            "selftext": "In my alternate Reddit account I make various of roleplays. One roleplay I made that was at the time one of the better ones and even had a total of 5 people to roleplay with (at the start because 3 ghosted me).\n\nThe title of the roleplay was \"Eternal Heroes\" which I'll talk a little about the plot of that roleplay. You're basically half of an immortal race called Eternals and your mother in this case is part of a super hero organization. You want to be more like your mother as in a super hero and you do your best to follow her footsteps before the main problem begins.\n\nSounds like a simple roleplay in general however... one of my roleplayers (the 2 that remained. Only the 1 managed to not only complete all 3 chapters of the roleplay but got a good ending.) Well this other roleplayer who I roleplayed with turned my relatively action packed roleplay with good story and plot development into a fuck fest.\n\nYes you heard me right, a fuck fest. From having sex with her mother, to trying to bang every woman in the facinity. While I don't mind some nsfw in my roleplays, he pushed it way too hard on me and it even slowed down the actual plot. He would hardly stay for the actual plot of the story but stay very much active in the sex scenes.\n\nI even at one point called him out for it but in the end he still went on thinking with his pants. At one point I was like \"You know what...\" and then blocked him.\n\nThanks to him I went a straight 6 months declining all nsfw roleplays. Even wrote on my actual profile \"No Sex Roleplays Allowed.\" It left such a bad taste in my mouth and I hated every bit of it. Eventually I calmed down but that roleplayer was really thinking with his pants. If he wanted a hentai roleplay they arw reddits for that. Yet he did that on a reddit made more for sfw roleplays (which my roleplay was originally made for). \n\nSo in the end I blocked that guy and I am so glad I did. He stressed me out so much, plus his roleplay replies were mediocre in general. So in the end I'm glad that is over and I never have to revisit that again.",

He seemed to accept that, was actually really kind and supportive about it, and started chatting until we were both off work and could actually focus on figuring out the plot for the rp.

Is annoying at times and when you find people like that (especially when they lie about their age so they can roleplay) then is one of those things that can be a pain.\n\nNow again I don't mind roleplaying with children for as long as they meet my criteria. Especially since most of the time my roleplays are sfw. However again children suck to roleplay with at times. They do have the most time for roleplay because of course they do, but at times is a pain to roleplay with them. Honestly is hard to filter our children in roleplay communities.",

Which is of course understandable and I am not saying it's not their right. Rl always comes first. \n\nIt's just that I though 'yes, finally I have my long term partner I can rely on. I am home' \n\nI despise looking for a new partner more than anything. Going through this process where people don't even read my ads and having to ask the same questions over and over again just... Bro. Read my fucking ad.\nI had 20 or more people messaging me for ships I was not looking for!! \nAlso most people just want their quick romance and then they lose interest, because there is literally no investment from their side. I just can't stand this anymore, because I am someone who puts quite the heart into a rp. And I'm far away from being the best. I make mistakes like any other, but instead of them telling what they have a problem with, they just leave, even though there was awesome ooc (at least I think there was) and it's just grinding my gears.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the one sided conversations you have to have with those people. You actually have to ask all the questions, because they are so passive about everything, that they just don't ask themselves. No, if you're silent, they are too.\n\nI just don't want that anymore. Everyone ghosts. They lose interest (I mean it happens. Happened to me as well of course, but I just don't leave. I tell my partner, we switch things up and everyone is happy.)\n\nOkay not everyone. I have one, one of all the partners I had, that hasn't ghosted me yet. We still write from time to time, which I'm super thankful for, but I just need to vent this.\nLooking for partners here is so.... Ugh.\n\nTake this post with a lot of salt. I just needed to vent. I still don't feel better, but man! People can't be serious. After months of investing time and feelings, fangirling and whatnot, people just leave. I'm sick of it",

Wish I could come up with something better but I'm sorta frustrated. \n\nI've been getting people who want to RP that have been frustrating me. \nI get someone messaging saying\n\n 'im interesting in Roleplaying with you'\n\nGet that's fine. A greeting would be great but all good. Then I most to asking questions. What is their preffered fandom, what gender pairing are they looking for. \nTo which they tell me but in short responses. Like they answer and don't message anything more or extra to keep the responses consistent so I'm not doing all the work. \nWell they still make me do all the work and planning. \n\nIt's happened a few times and it gets frustrating. I don't like controlling my roleplay partners every move. \n\n\n\nAnother thing that irritates me is people not reading my whole posts. \nSo in my Roleplay posts, I add rules and preferences. Basically stating my boundaries. \nAnd just recently, I've been getting too many OCxOC roleplay requests that end with a partner dipping because my character isn't good enough for theirs after all. \nSo I put in my request: \"Canon x Oc(me) is a major preference. OC x OC is ok. I've been getting too much of this request and I might deny if you ask.\"\n\nLike I still give a chance to ask just in case I'm feeling up for it. \n\nBut what gets me is the guilting. Here is a word for word example of what was sent to me: \"I do wanna use my oc but seeing how maybe that's unlikely, I'll just stick to using a Canon character\" \n\nLike come on. It doesn't hurt to ask instead of giving me that. It doesn't make me want to do OC x OC at all. \n\nThe thing is, I'm starting to crack down on what I want now in a roleplay. Because in all the time I've Roleplayed, it's been only what my partner wants and out of my comfort zone things to make them happy. \nMy goal is to try making sure both parties are happy with planning and making a roleplay work. \nI'm tired of one sided shit and I'm tired of doing something that doesn't work no matter how many times I do it. \n\nSo yeah. That's my little vent for today.",

            "selftext": "Okay so to preface this, technically I knew this person prior to our failed attempt to roleplay *Tokyo Revengers* (by the way if y'all haven't checked out that anime/manga, you should, it's fucking awesome) but this story, in particular, was the final nail in the coffin. This was on Quotev, by the way.\n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nThis story is about a user called...M. I first met them in my early RP days, perhaps around 2016?? And I admittedly was kinda prone to being bad when it came to responding back to the ones I wasn't super interested in. I think they either joined my *Kingdom Hearts* group or they had one that I joined; now, what happened was I think we did a few replies together but then my stupid ass got distracted and stopped replying. \n\nWhat I didn't expect to happen was that this person started messaging a b a r r a g e of shit to me. Initially, it was just the 'hey are you going to reply?' sort of thing...but then after a while they started getting pissed off at me, writing in all caps about how I was ignoring them (which, admittedly by then I *was* because I just wanted them to fucking stop) and all this other shit. I did apologise when they wouldn't stop, but I didn't RP with them again.\n\nA couple of years passed, and I've improved at my RP ability and also at responding to people, and I kinda forgot all about that incident. Turns out that person ended up getting their first account deleted due to drama shit, so I hadn't realised it was the same asshole who sent me all that shit prior. Not much happened to be honest; they've RPed with me like three times but they never last more than a few paragraphs because they never really give enough material in replies, and ironically, disappeared without a word a lot - unlike them though, I didn't spam their notifications because I wasn't a prick.\n\n**THE MAIN ACT:**\n\nThe year is 2021, and it's around late July or early August I think. I've gotten *hella* better at RPing (not to toot my own horn, but-) and also like to befriend my partners and headcanon more actively. I'm a lot more transparent about why I don't reply at certain times. This person joined my Multifandom group and I decided 'third time's the charm'. Things went okay for a bit, they chose their fandom, *Tokyo Revengers*. Fuck yes, I think, I love that manga so much and I need to develop my OC for it more. They send their OC in and they're...? Fine enough, so I make them their topic and we start plotting.\n\nThis is where things start to go shit-shaped; sometime after, I think due to a mix of university stuff and IRL feelings, I was in a *massive* writing slump and hadn't responded to the RP for a while, though I did my best to keep plotting through messages, but I ultimately just...wasn't really feeling it. I did my best to power through, since I thought it was just because of my slump; but then M began to be...a pest. By this, they would comment on my stuff a lot, now I'd normally be fine with this. But...well, my instinct suspected it was just their way of trying to get me to reply faster, and the end result was I felt more guilty for not replying fast enough. \n\nEventually, I realised I was suffering burnout, so I decided it was fair to put a PSA up explaining things. This is what I said.\n\n**PSA:** Hello everyone! So, as you've all probably seen, I've been suffering from what I've deduced to be some form of burnout. Because of this, I'll be dropping a few roleplays, namely those in my Multifandom group. If you're not in that group, you don't need to worry, and you're free to start another one with me, though I'll be redoing my rules for...certain reasons, namely due to previous experiences. I apologise, but I feel it's for the best, and since I feel it's unfair to leave you all hanging on a reply that could come out forced and shit, to put it bluntly. Please like my status once read!\n\n15 people liked that post. M was *not* one of them. Rather, like fucking clockwork, they messaged me this. This is how the conversation went down, copy and pasted straight from the site.\n\n**M**: Hey sorry I wanna check with your post you made is our tokyo revengers rp still okay orbis that dropped?\n\n**My thoughts**: So you read the PSA, yet didn't follow the basic instruction of liking it once you read it, and you're assuming our RP is okay even though I said I'll be dropping my Multifandom ones???\n\n**What I actually said:** Hey! I\u2019m sorry, but due to burnout as well as a lot of stuff going on with uni, I\u2019m dropping all the ones in the multi fandom group including ours.\n\n**M, saying the words that are FOREVER ingrained in my head:** oh okay :( kinda wish i didn't reply to the rp than\n\n...\n\nEx. FUCKING. SCUSE me? \n\nI am not obligated to RP with you, I do this for a hobby. Trust me, I don't LIKE making PSAs unless I really need to, and if I'd KNOWN for a certainty I was suffering from burnout before and not just regular writer's block, **I would have fucking told you**. So, what happens next? I didn't respond to that, partially because I didn't know what *to* say and also because part of me suspected I might go off and I didn't wanna do that. And then, after following me for 2 damn years, M unfollows me. \n\nThis...basically confirmed everything I had suspected - that they were the same fucking asshole, who spammed messages to someone they hardly knew over not replying to a goddamn RP, and only valued me as an RP partner and nothing more. Ironically, a majority of their activities are them bitching about various dramas they've had, and it makes me wonder if the reason those RPs fell through was because of their partners getting tired of their shit. Sure wouldn't surprise me!\n\nBottom line; people aren't obligated to RP with you and valuing people for RPs is super fucking scummy.",

He has an energy limit with possession, he can only possess someone for 4 hours and that is when completely sedentary. Apart from that they would have a chance at taking control back n then the body would be at a fight with two people using it- if the body were to pass out or he\u2019d run out of energy, he\u2019d be back in his own body and both parties would be passed out.\n\nSo overall his powers have limits\nI knew someone who rps who had all that too but their oc had no limit, because of possession could take over someone for however long they wanted n more n now because of that most people don\u2019t wanna rp with James because they think he\u2019s gonna be some overpowered douche who cant be hit when that\u2019s not really what happens with him at all",

I'm looking for some third party perspectives. \n\nMy partner was ghosted by a mutual player on a server some time ago. It was very sad for him and he was emotionally wrecked losing not only a friend but the ship. In time we start to RP as well and have our own ship. \n\nI am into it, but it doesn't really seem like he is. He will respond minimally and in OOC he will talk to me a lot about his previous ship. He is still getting commissions and such of his character and his previous partner's character too and will show me them. Almost none of our OOC chatter is about our characters or our ship. It didn't bother me for a long time because I understood the attachment he had to the previous partner, but now it's been like a year and a half and we've barely got anywhere with ours. \n\nHe's not my only partner either so it's not like I have all my eggs in one basket. But it's still like. What do I do with this? You know? Should I let bygones be bygones? Thinking of just letting this partner go (but not as a friend, ofc, just stop rping).",

            "selftext": "Okay, so there are two things I wanna get off my chest here. One is short, but another is real long.\n\nFirst thing, I wanna RP really bad. So I figured hey, why not, go and submit a post on one of those tumblr blogs that are like 'hey, send an ask and find your partner from whoever interacts with the resulting post'. How fucking *funny* is it that whenever I submit anything, I notice it doesn't get posted immediately? By which I mean I sent two over the course of a month or two and I haven't seen any of my submissions. Again, how hilarious is that? :)\n\nBut anyway, that was the shorter, more petty one. This one is gonna be a long one. I met this guy who for anonymous sake, we'll call him 'Arrow'. Arrow has an OC who's gimmick is traversing the universe(s) and whatever happens happens. Or at least that's what I vaguely recall. So anyway, he runs into me and he expresses an interest in my OC who...Let's just say has a really raunchy history apparently. People just inexplicably love her in a NSFW way and after a while it made me uncomfortable. Even a concept of shipping with her is a bit of a uncomfortable area. But I digress. Arrow wants them to interact and I said 'sure' because this was around the time my current RP drought started to begin. \n\nEventually, Arrow started to offer up the option of them being in a romantic relationship. I enjoyed RPing with him so I said 'okay'. *Though it was never made official by our OCs themselves.* I want you to remember that. I eventually wanted to do an RP where they both basically follow the story beat of Majora's Mask, with a falling moon and only one way to stop it, by going to four different corners of the world. But like, not even a quarter way through the RP, I eventually started to have seconds thoughts about the ship between our OCs. So with a bit of reluctance, and nervousness, I (anxiously) told Arrow I didn't feel like doing it, and he said he was fine with it.\n\n....\n\nBut the story doesn't end there.\n\nEventually I get a message from him saying he wants to talk to me in an hour. An hour passed, and...I was greeted with this wall of text that basically amounted to Arrow saying he felt a wave of anxiety and depression coming from the fact that I said no to the ship in the end and insisted that I reconsidered. Even going as far as to say 'hey let's wait for the RP to end and you can have your final verdict then', along with a subtle threat saying 'If I go at the pace I'm going now, things might turn out bad'.\n\nSo, things could've theoretically ended there? Of course not, why would I stand for a subtle threat and basically an ultimatum/illusion of choice? So I came at Arrow once more time, to say with absolute confidence that I really didn't feel the ship. Then he started going on about 'Well what does my \\[as in myself\\] OC feel about this?\" Because she's a different entity. As though that would make a difference.\n\nEventually I just decided to block him after he gave me a goodbye and was like 'hopefully you'll reconsider in the future', and I haven't heard much of him sense.\n\nNow, before someone plays Devil's Advocate and say 'oh he just didn't feel that way for another character'. My retort to that is this; I noticed Arrow predominantly RPs with female characters, OC or otherwise. Even expressing wanting to RP with specifically a Female Byleth from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. So...Was it really something special? Or was I just an addition to a imaginary harem?\n\nI'll let you decide, because that's all I wanted to say.\n\nTL:DR 1: Want to RP yet nothing happens whenever I put an ad out.\n\nTL;DR 2: Guy wanted to ship with me on top of the other ships he had. I said no, he made a dramatic scene out of it, I kept insisting I didn't want to do it and he kept at it until I decided to block him.",
