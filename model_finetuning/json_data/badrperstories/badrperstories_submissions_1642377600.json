            "selftext": "This story is about the most obsessed and least successful people I ever met on German roleplaying sites.\n\nHe will message everyone (or close to everyone) who is online/active at the moment, and it's always the same message: 'Hello, would you help me with writing a story where you're a witch/wizard/djinn and transform me into...'. If you talk with him about his idea, they are always just centered around the process of transformation. He doesn't care about your character at all except that he is able to transform his character, he always has very detailed expectations of what he wants to be transformed into (for example a certain item of clothing, or a child) but his character has no personality, and there is basically no story except for the description of the transformation. Yeah, you probably all know about transformation kinks, and although it's not 100% certain that it's a kink, his obsession with this specific scenario makes it very likely. He often sends dozens of messages or more at once.\n\nNo, he doesn't care about your preferences at all, he never reads any information in someone's profile, not even if they're active and looking for roleplays at the moment. Often, he will write you multiple messages (if the mods don't ban him before), if you tell him you already declined his offer or even get a little angry at him, he doesn't reply to that message at all. Just to send you the same prompt the next time he comes online or if he gets banned, the next time he rejoins the forum. I know two smaller forums where he probably joined and got banned a dozen times in total already, people there know him so well that the mods immediately ban him when he joins again, but he never gives up. He always uses very similiar nicknames. On many other German forums/roleplaying sites or facebook groups, I encounter him. He even offers people between 20 and 50 Euro to 'write his story'. If you ask him if this is a kink, or you call him out for approaching minors with a kinky prompt, he doesn't reply at all. He doesn't seem to care about being called out or banned, he just rejoins sometime later or joins new groups.\n\nHe also lies about his age. For example, he was 26 when I 'met' him for the first time, about six years later he is 28,29, 25, or sometimes 19. In all these years, his obsession never changed a bit. If you met him once, you will always immediately recognize him.\n\nMy problem is not that he has very unique prompt, or that he posts it multiple times, but...\n\n\\-he approaches minors with something that is most likely kink related, but acts like it's just a normal fantasy story, all while obviously lying about his age\n\n\\-sometimes, his stories include minors as far as I can tell, which is...highly questionable, to say the least\n\nLast but not least, being spammed with his prompts and him constantly overstepping boundaries to get what he wants is super annoying. Even if it wasn't kink related, which I highly doubt, he still lies about his age frequently.",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna get to the point. \n\nI sorta want to try roleplaying Canon characters again.\nI used to do it in the past but I had stepped on and taken advantage of my willingness to roleplay canon characters for someone's oc. \n\nSo I ended up putting in my requests that I won't portray Canon characters unless they are side characters.  \n\nBut now I sort of want to play Canon Characters more. But I'm afraid I'm going to get taken advantage of when I do this. Not only that, I'm hella picky about people's OCs.  \n\nLike some personalities make me either uncomfortable or just irk me in the wrong way and I end up getting really irritated. I'm scared that I'll portray the characters the wrong ways or not to how people expect for their fantasies. \n\nI feel like maybe I can make a mini bio that states the Canon character's personalities and such but I feel like that would be disregarded. Not only that is I've seen that people will tell you what to do and be when it comes to pairing Canon character to their oc. \n\nEx: 'I want you to be this character for my oc.' \nThen it's followed by a knight in shining armor plot that my character has to save their oc who's been abused and such. Or that they demand you be a Dom role which means you do most of thebsiltory pushing and such while it focuses on just their character. \n\nAnyways, I personally ballow people to pick who they want to be and are comfortable bwith being while clearing up that I don't mind how ooc they make the characters becasue honestly, I'm focused on story and such. \n\nAnyways, that's off topic. I just want help with how I can go about portraying Canon characters again. And it would be only for Canon x Oc and not Canon x Canon unless it's a proven relationship in the show or game. \n\nSo yeah, please send advice on what I can do.",

I keep running into folks that seriously cannot understand the difference between fiction and reality!\n\nI'm a romance writer, mainly MxF with me playing F, and keep running into people who think I'm romantically interested in them because we wrote a romance story together! I met this guy off of a roleplaying app and things started off really nice! The plot was great, the characters were awesome, and our first few responses were beautiful! I was really looking forward to pushing the story forward until he sends me another message detailing how much he likes me and how nice I am and if I wanted to be his girlfriend??? I told him I was engaged and that it was just a roleplay and he completely flipped his shit! He asked if my character was even me and I was like no??? I don't put myself into my characters and that I write for fun and he says that I'm a tease, that I lead him on and I come to find out that his character is literately him!!! He literately has been roleplaying as himself and just thought I was doing the same??\n\nThis is literately the second time it's happened to me and I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this? I'm pretty nice and treat everyone the same because y'know I think everyone deserves kindness but people keep taking it the wrong way? Hell, even in request posts I'll put that I'm engaged and work full-time so people know my schedule tends to be busy but it's like they completely gloss over it.",

And this after all the damned lying, rationalizing, prevaricating and deflecting you did. Pretty impressive; rarely have I ever seen such a blatantly-clear example of DARVO. (Don't know what that means? *Look it up.*)\n\nDoes it matter to me? No, not really; after what I was subjected to, I had already made the decision to leave. The staff there is unnecessarily heavy-handed, and I'm pretty sure someone there had a hate hard-on for me anyway. I had problems every time I went in there, in one way or another, so no great loss. Lots of places I can find RP partners, so I don't need a sad, greasy pile of elitism and cliques. The place is perfect for you.\n\nYou could have declined to ask me why I awarded you what I did. You could have done the amazing thing and listened\u2014really *listened*\u2014to what had so hurt and upset me. But, guess that's outside of your capability, just like the common courtesy of an apology. A *real* apology. Had you given one and meant it, I would have accepted it. But no! Nope! Sounds like what you told me you were doing in the line of self-improvement isn't working!\n\nThe lies about what happened are stunning. Not only did you tell me 'I am frankly bored' after I busted my goddamned ass to write with and for you, you also misrepresented and frankly pissed on work I had spent years on researching and developing, and then tried to rationalize the lies themselves. The level of dishonesty and arrogance was mindblowing. \n\nYou have a  RP going that has some longevity\u2014how awesome for you! I have more creativity in my toenail cuttings than you have in your entire body. I create worlds, languages, entire geopolitical structures\u2014and, most important, *I publish.* Whereas you said yourself that you wear a handle from a character in a book that you will never publish. Desperately amusing!\n\nI'm sure you're happy with yourself for getting me suspended. However... don't be. You told me, and I have the screenshot, that you would not do it. I walked away a second time. And lo and behold! \n\nHave a nice life, you craven, puling, intrinsically-dishonest hypocrite.",

            "selftext": "Y'know, I was all-too positive about making a Discord server for roleplaying. I had been in quite a few in the past and been in very few that were managed properly. Most Discord RP servers are mismanaged, clique-y, unorganized and typically really just active for the group that actually participates in it or is completely dead. I helped mod some of these and helped them get back into working order which is pretty cool. I figured given my mod/DM experience as a player and staff member on Discord servers, maybe it was my turn to get into it and start one for myself. So, what was currently nabbin' at me? Helluva Boss. I recently started the series. if you go look at my Reddit profile, you will 100% find my advertisement posts. I loved the characters, the world, the vibe and really wanted a chance to write in a full group RP with plenty of people and see what, well, transpires!\n\nGoing into it, I knew one important thing: I had a strong inkling the  kind of people that Helluva Boss roleplay would attract. Probably the same kind of people that really enjoy Undertale, FNAF, Sonic, y'know, those fandoms. What kind of people am I referring to? Kids. Teens. And immature young adults. Hey, I like these fandoms. But I find I run into younger, more inexperienced, less creative writers in these particular fanbaseses than I do something much more mainstream such as Marvel, Star Wars, GoT (they may be generic, but I find more mature, decent writers here -- though they're all usually looking for the same thing.) \n\nSo I set up the server to be organized and have fully detailed explanations of how it works. Honestly, it's petty simple. I have a rules channel and a welcome-center channel that outlines the way the server works and what you need to do to get started. It's simple -- You wanna take a canon character? Check the cast-and-character-list to see what canon character is open and who has them. Wanna go for an OC? That is A-okay. Our character-application section has two templates for Canon Character applications and Original Character applications. For a creative writer that enjoys RP, they are pretty simple. All it really asks is a few simple, basic questions about you as a writer and the character you want to play. For canon characters to be approved, you must showcase your writing at the bottom of the application. A created scene, that can be anything and however long you want, of your character to show us what kind of writer you are and how well you can manage that canon character. Once that's done, submit it into our applications channel in the Google Doc its written in and you'll be golden. The only other system for canon characters is reservations. If you step in, see your character is free, you can ask for a 3 day reservation to write the application. If you're approved, you're golden. If you're rejected (and we typically work with any issues we have with the application first), you can resubmit it a week later. That period is just to give someone else a chance, y'know? It's only fair. \n\nWe have multiple threads to be able to use for RP. We'll all follow a general timeline, but to avoid characters bein stuck in scenes due to inactivity, scenes don't all have to take place at the same time if they're in different threads. \n\nSo, pretty simple stuff, right? Top of that, 3 decent mods willing to answer any questions at all. So how does this go so wrong? \n\nWell... I opened up the server onto Disboard. It's time to get to recruiting. It has been... AWFUL. apart from that fact minors have joined, (though we establish multiple times this is an 18+ writing community), we've managed to discover a minor here and there. We had a small influx of very dull, semi-lit writers that had questions about EVERYTHING THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE WELCOME CENTER. Every single question they had, there was an answer in the welcome center. When they ask about canons or OCs, and I explain the application system, they whine and go \"thats a lot of work, i just wanna rp.\" But there's no way I can create a space where actual decent, creative, quality writers have to write scenes with people that have boring, uninspired, less creative, grammar/spelling error riddled writing and are not even willing to read the rules. Some people even do their canon character applications by just writing out a scene that is literally just a scene from the cartoon and think it will pass. The person I confronted about this said, \"Well, do you really expect people to come up with new scenes for canon characters?\"  \n\n\nUH -- IF YOU WANT A CANON CHARACTER IN A ROLEPLAY SERVER, ISN'T THAT KIND OF THE WHOLE IDEA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is it so much to ask you do a simple app and just provide a writing sample that I'm allowing to only be ONE paragraph. You don't have the creative muscles to write 3-5 original sentences???\n\nSo apart from low-effort, low quality roleplayers coming to the server -- I have also had more experienced writers tell me they're too hesitant to join because of the crowd that Helluva Boss attracts. So that sucks. Every time I bump the server on Disboard, we get 2-3 new people. Who do one of two things:\n\n\\- Join and then leave after 2 mins.\n\n\\- Join and say nothing for 3-5 days.\n\n\\- Join and immediately start ripping on the server for being generally quiet.\n\nI made it like a week or so ago. You can see on Disboard there are only like, 12 people in here and people expect a booming, poppin', happening general-chat. It's been tough and challenging to accept and find members while weeding out the ones that are lazier and don't want to read anything if it isn't like, 2 sentences. There isn't this insanely high standard. If you look at the writing - I'd say most people on the server are decent, not godlike writers. Growing it feels tough. I'm stuck on it completely. How do people \"enjoy\" the RP hobby without wanting to write anything? What is fun about \\*goes home and watches tv\\*. Isn't this kind of a writer's hobby? Y'know, text-based roleplay? What's with this?",

            "selftext": "I hate to write something like this in here, especially since the person I'm about to write about isn't necessarily a bad roleplayer but I'm not entirely sure where to turn at this point and I'm getting a little stressed out. \n\nSo.. I guess I'll start at the very beginning. I met Kathy (not real name) in November or December of 2020 when I joined one of her RP servers on Discord. I had a really great first impression of her. She seemed incredibly organized, kind, creative, and had a good head on her shoulders. I thought she was an awesome server owner, and actually owned multiple RP servers, which I found impressive. Some of which I think were a few years old, which again, was very impressive as a lot of Discord RP servers don't last very long. I worried that maybe her plate was too full, but otherwise we had a pretty decent relationship. I didn't consider this girl my friend, but I respected her and was willing to write with her. \n\nI ended up joining and leaving a few of her servers, not necessarily because she was a bad owner, but because I often lose motivation or muse for certain roleplays, so I leave certain servers and join new ones. Eventually in early 2021, I got the confidence to make my own roleplay server and picked her, a friend of mine, and someone else I knew from a previous server to be mods. The third person that I picked to be a mod, turned out to be a bad option, because she rarely was active and didn't help me at all. Kathy helped me for a little while, but ended up becoming inactive in all of her servers, because she was moving in with her boyfriend. I completely understood and cut her some slack. So for the majority of the time, it was just me and my friend running this new server. \n\nMy friend Valerie (again, not real name) and I did pretty well running the server with just the two of us.  Eventually Kathy got a little more active after her move, but didn't help with any mod work. Again, I was fine with this because I knew she was adjusting to her new home as well as a new job. However, I started to notice some red flags in her behavior. She consistently complained that she didn't think she fit in with the group, and that no one wanted to roleplay with her. She seemed a bit whiny, but I kind of just concluded that she was still stressed from her move and adjusting. I tried to make sure that she felt included in the roleplay, and I remember playing with a few of her characters. \n\nCome August though, Valerie ended up having some serious medical issues, which kept her offline. On top of that, my depression seemed to come back in full force. Since my head mod and I were having real life difficulties, I had no choice but to give the server to my friend \"Michelle\". As far as I'm aware Michelle still runs the server. I'm very proud of her, even though I'm no longer in it. \n\nAfter that I took a break to get my mental health together and didn't run any groups. I just did 1x1 roleplays or joined groups run by other people. But by November I was feeling better, and I decided to try my hand at running a server again, which is where we get to my current issue.. sorry for the long essay of backstory. \n\nSo instead of running a larger more public server like I did with my first one, I decided to do a smaller group that mostly consisted of just friends. The group was small enough, so I didn't feel like I needed any mods. Valerie, Michelle, and Kathy all joined this group after Valerie recovered and Kathy seemed to have a bit more time to write. Things seemed pretty good. \n\nAs the roleplay began and progressed, I started noticing Kathy complain again. Some of her characters were picking up scenes, but she was having trouble with getting started with two of her characters. She hated how she didn't have as much time to write as the other roleplayers in the group and would complain about it constantly. However, when she did have time to write, she usually told us that she didn't feel like it and instead told us that she was going to go read. \n\nAs the server owner I did everything in my power to try to make her happy. I even ended up making a character to potentially be a love interest for one of her characters, but ultimately I just didn't feel like the characters were compatible, and she didn't seem particularly interested in my character anyways. So I ended up choosing to do other stories with that character. I think that's what made her ultimately decide to drop her character. She was very angry about what happened and I felt guilty.. but she didn't seem to want to push to write with me, so I didn't know what to do. \n\nThe group is still currently running, and it's going very well except for the stuff with Kathy. It seems like Kathy is always in a bad mood for some reason, from bad days at work, to drama in other roleplay servers. She's a constant stick in the mud that spoils my mood. I also think her quality of writing, and skill at character creation has also plummeted, since her character sheets always look like she put 0 effort into them. Some I've even had to reject, and she's gotten upset about. The only reason I know is because other people in the server tell me whenever she's upset with me. It's never her talking to me, there always seems to be a middle man. \n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I've done my absolute best to make sure she's felt welcome in my group. Valerie has reassured my multiple times that I've been doing my best. I don't even feel like writing with her anymore because she makes me so uncomfortable. Sometimes I feel like she hates me. I'm 99% certain that this shift in personality started to happen just after her move, so I know that it's most likely not me and this most likely has to do with something in her offline life, but at the end of the day, I'm still uncomfortable. I've thought about kicking her out of my group a few times, but I know she's pretty good friends with some of the other members. \n\nI think maybe talking to her might be my best bet to see if I can't fix things, but at the same time the idea of talking to her really makes me nervous. I don't know, what would you do if you were in this situation? \n\n\\---\n\nTLDR - I have a member in my roleplay group that is most likely going through some bad stuff in real life, but her toxic behavior has made me uncomfortable in my own group.",

            "selftext": "For a long time now I have questioned maybe my expectations are off the chart however my self driven motives when typically role-playing are pretty fair for those that have ever written with me. \n\nSuch as communication, life is important, I can't stress enough about offering breaks/pauses, lengthy gaps to reply whenever, work etc but it seems like when you offer that new wave of writers take it for advantage and never reply. \n\nSo as being proactive or a pessimist(?) I come forward to genuinely ask if they are still interested, open to talk, communication etc as to what is going on. Like if we will continue writing or not, I typically get smacked with a cold shoulder or outright passive aggressive or even \"LOL sorry I forgot, was playing with friends\" on repeat. \n\nI am genuinely an honest person and forgiving too like most, but when someone makes a fool out of you three times and then suddenly you are the bad person in the case, am I really the bad one? \n\nI like to try and learn about those that I write with, it adds a level of cementing to be able to work better with said partner and understanding but I make sure I don't go crossing into the threshold of too much knowing. I'm not really there to be a friend at first, it takes time to acquire any form of friendship sentiment with writers. \n\nUsually six months and if I know someone has passed the two week boundary of writing with me then they are worth the effort of being able to learn about them, try to get to know them better and just be an all round someone to chat outside of writing too. \n\nThough it seems these days I can't even get that anymore, many self centered individuals, with egos that are overtly bloated all the time and quick to the gun. I just switch off and remove/ignore/block individuals without word. \n\nI have an okay compass, I genuinely don't mind being hostile towards me and saying whatever is on their mind, whatever displeases them, etc however when I speak my mind I am the bad person? \n\nWhat happened to being open to constructive criticism and teaching the other, why now days it is seen like some major crime or violation when speaking about what bothers you, yet everyone else will act entitled then go off the rails to shut you down. \n\nTL;DR: A writer that is confused if they are the problem or not.",

The plot was about an older high school teacher, attractive, smart &amp; majorly burned out due to the immaturity/childishness from her students. However she has a wondering eye for one of her students because he's just so mature &amp; shit. Code for: THIS LADY IS A CREEEP! \n\nThis student has a crush on a naive, sweet, but rather self centered girl his age. But soon this like, 42 something year old starts groomimg (not going to say seduce because this is a middle aged woman chasing after someone who is 16!) him &amp; starts bullying his crush for being so \"sheltered\" &amp; \"inexperienced\" Yep, thats right folks, this middle aged teacher is pissing on a 16 year old girl for being sexually/romantically inexperienced, because this teenager is just sooo not on her level. \n\nThis was on Tumblr too so not shocked about it.",

They didn\u2019t have a lot of karma, but their account was 47 days old (over 30 days) so I thought that\u2019s okay as I learned from the past never to accept an RP partner under 30 days as that is a high chance of being a throw away account. The plot idea he offered piqued my interested so I was in. It took time to create my new characters, write responses back to his, and we communicated very well in OOC. He wanted to use Tubberbox for our characters so I said okay. \n\nI also enjoyed brainstorming future scenes of the story. My last response he said he loved it and then I haven\u2019t heard from him in a few days which I assumed he has been busy so I was just going to write to him and ask how he was. Immediately noticed he was no longer on the discord. (Interestingly a few days ago he changed his discord username using discord nitro so not sure if that is a red flag). I went on Reddit to ask him why he left, but his Reddit was deleted. So now can\u2019t contact him on discord or Reddit. \n\nI guess I\u2019m glad I asked him in the beginning to give me the admin group in our Roleplay discord of just the two of us or else the whole discord I\u2019m sure would have disappeared too. I\u2019m just so confused. Why would someone look for a Roleplay partner and then deleted their discord/reddit account? What does someone accomplish in doing this?",

It had been nearly 24 hours since the post was made so I was not expecting a response, let alone the person sending me their discord so we could talk more there. As soon as we got over to discord I warned them that my responses would be spotty for the next hour or so due to personal things I'd rather not discuss. We talked a little bit for the next hour, but once everything was dealt with I told them I was now free for the rest of the evening. I also asked if they preferred roleplaying in dms or servers. They said they prefer servers. I asked if they could make the server while I quickly step away from my keyboard. Mind you I was gone maximum five minutes, just getting my dog more water. I come back and try to let them know I'm back, only to see I've been removed from their friends list. I tried to add them back again in case it was a mistake to find out I'd been blocked.   \n\n\nDid I do something wrong?",

            "selftext": "I'm just going to say it like this and I'll go into the story. Some people were not meant to be mods or owners of a server. \n\nNot too long ago, I joined this supernatural group that I thought would definitely be in my wheelhouse. Had great lore, I could bring in my original vampire, things were great! Started making friends left and right, one of which I consider my best friend. But very quickly, the cracks opened up and I saw the true nature of these people. \n\nFor example: They allowed characters to be abused in some absolutely horrible ways, threads that they brought over from a previous server and bragged about how much fun it was. I'm all one for putting my characters into compromised positions, but I'd never do to mine what they did to others. It was unreal! \n\nAnother thing was that the owner allowed the mods to bully other members by making fun of their ideas or creations, literally tearing them down even though they would fix things to suit the roleplay better. Made one person leave because they were made fun of for being overly sensitive. \n\nNot to mention the fact that they refused to let anyone get scenes in with them. The owner and her two mods constantly wrote with each other and didn't like making threads to help someone get situated into the story. Eventually, it all came down to a head when a mod insulted me and my friend for not agreeing to our characters being mistreated for fun. \n\nAll of this to just to vent about how much it still irks and surprises me that people are allowed to run servers who behave like that.",

Hey, it's your life.\n\nJust PLEASE, have the frigging common courtesy to inform your RP parters up front what kind of reply schedule they can expect. And if they are expecting more frequent replies than you can muster, TELL THEM and roleplay with somebody else.\n\nDon't overcommit yourself and then make up excuse after excuse for not following through. If you feel like you can't keep up with a roleplay going on, or your spark is burnt out, just TELL THEM, so they can break off and stop burning time and creativity on you.\n\nRoleplay is a hobby that needs two (or more) people to make it work. You get and you give, and if circumstances don't let you hold up your end, but a dang adult about it instead of stringing somebody else along who is putting their time and energy into something you won't reward.",
