There might be a paragraph or two, maybe 10+ sentences, but it\u2019s still a relatively short and snappy back and forth. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nLately I\u2019ve started to engage DM-only RPers, and I realise now the appeal is really long messages. Like, a chapter from a novel. But I don\u2019t get how to respond to that. How does dialogue work? It feels less like RP and more like a collaborative literature. Am I supposed to respond with an equally long and detailed chapter? We\u2019ve worked through a lot of the details in advance (like a whole day of planning) but after the first actual plot message I\u2019m instantly uncertain how to respond. \n\nHave I been getting RP wrong all this time? Is this like boss-level RP?  In the latest one my character is unaware of the things the other has set out, so I guess I switch the first person narrative and start his perspective without any regard for the lengthy text the other person has sent. \n\nI dunno.

            "selftext": "Before you read this, sorry for any grammatical errors! I wrote this on my phone while exhausted and in bed, I'll be responding to comments when I get some free time.\n\nI've recently started a nice, Fandom roleplay with a partner I found off-site from my primary roleplaying spot which is Discord. All sounds good, right? Well, at this point I'm at a loss for what I should do. My partner is a great writer but is impatient and very demanding and It's practically a chore to respond to him. So, I've come here in search for advice.\n\nI told this Partner that I'm quite a busy person and I can respond every couple of days at the minimum. Communication is key and sometimes I just don't get a chance to open Discord due to exhaustion and needing a break from a screen. He has said that he is a 'NEET' in the past which gives him more free time. Fair enough, I told him that my schedule is typically busy but I try to get around to respond when I get some time, not to big of a deal. Nightly, he will say one wore questions and expects a responce, fetting quite uoset after a day when I don't respond to him. Yet, the most annoying time of his impatience had shown through over my Birthday Weekend.\n\nNow, I will admit that I didn't alert him of this and I completely accept that it was my bad. This break was during the weekend on my Birthday when I was stuck in quarantine. I called my friends, played stuff on my main Discord - I use one generally for day-to-day life and conversations and another for roleplay to keep everything organized - and it was all in good fun. When I came back, I sent all of my partners little apologies yet this partner's immediately response to me saying I was 'with my friends' was to call me disrespectful and irresponsible (Which were his exact choice of words) which just angered me!\n\nAnother annoying thing is that he expects an explanation for every single time I'm not online. I told him in the past of what I work as and how busy I typically am. Whenever I say my answer he either A) Is fine with it or B) He goes on a tirade against me about how I'm rude or I can push my hobbies to the side to talk to him.\n\nGenerally, I'm a little lost on what I should do. Should I block him and tell him things don't work out? Stick it out? I'm just not sure since interacting with him is a burden due to how rude he can be to me and how invasive of my privacy he tends to be. I know this isn't the longest post, but I'd still like some help, please.",

It sucks because some ads really called out to me and I would have loved to play them and I've also seen those people keep posting it in hopes of finding another partners. I understand that nobody should RP with anyone they don't want to but it sucks because I look at that and it's like was my response so bad that you rather not give me a chance?

I have managed to avoid getting sucked into the more recent drama, but WHEW she has a lengthy record and I'm sure MANY OF YOU have met Negative Nancy.\n\n* Nancy always joins crossover DC/Marvel Tumblr rps\n* Nancy complains about toxic ex-partners who \"forced\" her into shipping\n* Nancy complains about gay ships and makes people uncomfy\n* Nancy tries to be Woke and awkwardly attaches herself to POC representation even though she is a self-proclaimed \"Southern\" woman in her 20s who heavy-handedly victimizes all of her POC characters in a grossly misinformed way\n* Nancy attaches herself to the admins and seems Invincible \n* Nancy begins to verbally abuse members she doesn't like \n* Nancy then manipulates members she likes for ships\n* Nancy will later accuse everyone of all the above behaviors, so take note\n* Nancy believes everyone else is the problem, when she's run off upwards of half a dozen people in under a year\n* Nancy will be homosexual one day, then bi, then asexual, depending on the topic and which sexuality will make her the authority/victim in the situation\n* Nancy will turn on you, screenshot selectively and cut out all the nasty things she says, and dramatically hurt people for the sake of throwing her \"friends\" under the bus\n* This is why Nancy has no friends\n\nIf you know girl, then you know girl\n\nIf you don't know girl, beware of girl",

He was very enthusiastic and seemed to be very descriptive. Now, the role wasn't set up to have smut, but it was a possibility depending on if the characters clicked; he seemed fine with that. Though it wasn't going to be a right off the bat thing, and I made that very clear, or I thought I did. Anyway, it came time for character descriptions. At first, I was impressed by how long and detailed his seemed to be. It was about 3 paragraphs long, but when I started to actually read it, my jaw dropped. This dude used 2 paragraphs, 6+ sentences each, to describe his characters \"manhood\". I was in shock, to say the least. I told him *again* that I wasn't interested in smut this soon into the rp; he blocked and ghosted me. \n\nI'm honestly angry with myself that I deleted the message and didn't save it. But that was a first, and I don't know if it will ever happen again.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a few rps like this, but basically here\u2019s how it would go down. \n\nWe talk out our rp idea. Sometimes without even discussion about how long each reply should be. We start roleplaying. Maybe they start with a big paragraph. Or even I start with a big paragraph. That\u2019s all good, because something you need to set the scene. But then I have a replay that\u2019s just a couple of sentences long, and they get mad. Could be understandable, and sometimes I even try to accommodate, but occasionally things go wrong. \n\nThis one guy started out a big paragraph made up of a few incredibly long run-on sentences with awful writing. I tried to get him to edit it a bit so I could at least follow what\u2019s happening (I may have been a bit harsh with the proofreading tbh). I reply with four sentences (what he said was the minimum) and give something for his character to react to.\n\nHe gets mad. Says one of my sentences wasn\u2019t a sentence (to be fair it was two words, but still technically a sentence) and he wanted more. \n\nOn this other site someone wanted five paragraph replies. That\u2019s like a short essay. I don\u2019t even get how to write that much without taking over the narrative. I wasn\u2019t a GM; we each had our own characters. \n\nMaybe more \u201cliterate\u201d (I don\u2019t like that term) roleplayers could explain. I could handle most of my replies being a paragraph or two. I could handle having some be three times five. But sometimes my character just says something or does something. Sometimes it\u2019s just \u201caction-reaction\u201d and it\u2019s fast-paced. If it\u2019s like a fight scene or fast-paced conversation, I could only spend so much time describing minor detail before I run out or things get boring.",

Now I'd like you to help me with a situation that has been bothering me for a while.\n\nSo to explain my situation, I'm in a pretty intense period right now, between exams, and revising like crazy, and sometimes I really want to relax, okay play with my irl friends, my bf, play with my playstation 5 is cool, but I really like roleplaying except I have a problem. I've been so nice that I have rp's in all directions and it's really HORRIBLE.\n\nI've been too nice to too many people, and it's been killing me. Now I have a lot of different roleplays, and the worst thing is that this morning I sorted them out, and I found out that most of them don't interest me anymore, or that the people I play with don't give me any fun, Between the short replies, the spams because I don't reply and so on, it's driving me crazy, COMPLETELY CRAZY, I want to do a huge sorting, to leave a lot of roleplay and start all over again, with a little bit of partner and ideas that really interest me. So I would like if you want to help me to make a kind of farewell letter! I don't want them to feel guilty but some of them I really regret to have accepted, and some of them whose plot doesn't interest me anymore.\n\nSo I'd like some advice on how to tell them that I'm not interested anymore or that I don't want to rp with them anymore unfortunately, and some advice on how to better organize my roleplay, because I had so many different roleplays that I was confusing some of them with others, which was creating some really weird moments. and honestly it's just driving me crazy with so much mess in my messages because of that.\n\nSorry for the spelling mistakes :)",

We joined a super villain RP thanks to a mutual friend and my character Alex clicked with him. \n\nI didn't get a single line in before Key's character started talking about how him and Alex are such good friends and how Alex's other friends are evil. I tried to make Alex a calm person to explain his real backstory, but Key wasn't having it. He'd say \"no, that's not what happened, this is what happened\" and he's insert his character into Alex's backstory. Small notice, Alex was a 1000 year old god and Key's character was a 14 year old boy. \n\nHe was very adamant that his version of Alex's story was the \"real\" version and even started rewriting Alex's personality into this scared little kid instead of a wise adult. I finally got mad and told Key to quit it, Alex was my character, not his, so he had no place to completely rewrite my stuff. Key told me that he was trying to manipulate me so Alex would help his character in a mission, and I was just floored. This guy thought telling me how Alex should be written was the same as getting Alex to help his character in story. \n\nI didn't know what else to do but sit there in shock. Still wouldn't know what to do if it happened now.",

            "selftext": "I once responded to someone's role-play ad because they seemed to have a fresh and original prompt that touched on a particular theme that I really like.  Our initial discussions re-enforced that perception - they were clearly a good writer with creative capabilities, and we seemed to be cooking up something that would \"scratch both of our itches\" with a more or less original scene and original characters.  \n\nSince it was their prompt, I let them take the lead to get started.  The world they built, which did sort of lend itself to exploring the agreed upon theme, turned out to be a slice from the Japaese anime series \"Attack on Titan\".  I was slow to tumble to this, as a result of knowing virtually nothing about that series (I'm just not interested in anime).\n\nIf I'd fully understood this up front, I would have said, \"Oh, I probably can't do a good job in this universe, you need someone who's seen Attack on Titan.  But good luck!\".  That's why I consider it partly my fault. \n\nSo now we're role-playing with Eren and Armin... ok, I can make that work... but I assumed that other aspects and incidental characters were original.  Nope.  The more I learned about AoT, I saw that almost everything was copied.  Except, of course, I wasn't doing it right because I don't know how it's supposed to go! \n\nBy the time I fully realized how obsessively bound my writing partner was to the AoT universe for this story, I already felt invested in trying to make our RP work; between us we'd written a dozen chapters that each seriously overwhelmed the character minimum in Discord. :-)\n\nThis dragged on, with me gradually feeling less enthusiastic and more frustrated that the original theme of the RP was nowhere in sight.  When I brought this up, my role-play partner agreed to try to condense things to get back on track... they waited about a half-day... then without warning unfriended me on Discord  (server no longer visible and everything I'd written disappeared) and deleted their throw-away reddit account where we met. \\*poof\\*\n\nTo be honest, by that time I was relieved to be free of the time sink. They're no doubt happier watching AoT by themself. But to delete a Discord server after we'd written probably 100k of text... dayum.\n\nMy advice: unless you're actually into RP'ing Attack on Titan yourself, steer clear of anyone who is.",

I have come to talk about a strange session I had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWarhammer setting, aboard a Battleship that the descendants of the crew have docked on. We are doing tests to get ingratiated to said descendants. So, I go out and find some slavers and their collection of ill-gotten loot. Great presents, so I go in and kill them.\n\nMake my way to the brig, and there is a big ol' door. A door that, to my perspective, is the only thing between the prisoners, and freedom. So naturally I cut through the door with my plasma cutter, and the GM goes \"Why did you do that? It wasn't locked\"\n\nWeird, I think. But ok, maybe the GM is trying to save face because he forgot I had a Plasma Cutter. So I go inside and there are people all chained to the walls - I guess that's why the door was unlocked? But I didn't know that at the time. Anyway, one of them says \"Hello noble adventurer, please help us. *There is a key somewhere around here\"* \n\nI hear the plot hook bells nice and clear, and go looking for the key. Only to get \"You spend twenty minutes looking for a tiny metal object in a disorganized lair filled with tiny metal objects. Eventually, you don't find it\"  and then **OOCLY** asked me why I went looking for a key, I have a Plasma Cutter. And then bandit reinforcements come because I took too long looking for the key. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at the end of this I am left thoroughly confused, no idea what is going on, and get kicked a day later for not playing how the GM wants.",

Now I'd like you to help me with a situation that has been bothering me for a while.\n\nSo to explain my situation, I'm in a pretty intense period right now, between exams, and revising like crazy, and sometimes I really want to relax, okay play with my irl friends, my bf, play with my playstation 5 is cool, but I really like roleplaying except I have a problem. I've been so nice that I have rp's in all directions and it's really HORRIBLE.\n\nI've been too nice to too many people, and it's been killing me. Now I have a lot of different roleplays, and the worst thing is that this morning I sorted them out, and I found out that most of them don't interest me anymore, or that the people I play with don't give me any fun, Between the short replies, the spams because I don't reply and so on, it's driving me crazy, COMPLETELY CRAZY, I want to do a huge sorting, to leave a lot of roleplay and start all over again, with a little bit of partner and ideas that really interest me. So I would like if you want to help me to make a kind of farewell letter! I don't want them to feel guilty but some of them I really regret to have accepted, and some of them whose plot doesn't interest me anymore.\n\nSo I'd like some advice on how to tell them that I'm not interested anymore or that I don't want to rp with them anymore unfortunately, and some advice on how to better organize my roleplay, because I had so many different roleplays that I was confusing some of them with others, which was creating some really weird moments. and honestly it's just driving me crazy with so much mess in my messages because of that.\n\n\nSorry for the spelling mistakes...

            "selftext": "So this is a story how I made a rule to protect the girls and women in the group, a rule to protect myself (Very interesting. I am a dude by the way)\n\nSo interesting tidbit, I have started rp as a hobby in 2019. When I looked at it at first I found it odd and weird however I hung mostly around on amino at that time. I enjoy it. My characters were first broken. Not gonna lie, the word balance was a work in progress but after some reworks they finally are a bit overtuned. \n\nI have done public roleplays with romance, well once. And it was a good experience. 2 oc's who like eachother and nothing more. It wasn't the main focus. However over the year I noticed a trend where, if I were to do a private rp. Smut was always what happened in the first 2 hours of the rp (None of it instigated by me. Dunno why people are horny for a dude that I clearly make out to have a neutral or a Disliked personality but alright. You do you) and that the first person I had fun with was only going to keep it in that chat. I respected it, I preferred it that way as well. So I decided to simply be strict and not do a public romance. Even with my friends because I can't pull double standards.\n\nSo I decided to join a public chat. It was all fun. Couple gripes and red flags but not that it would ruin my rp experience. In that same chat a girl I did a private rp with was also in there. In our private chat, our ocs got together. However remember when I stated the rule of \"No romance in public rps\" for myself? Well let's say she didn't fully agree. I try to have public and private separate simply so that we don't neuter eachothers oc. She however claimed my oc to be her man, and I was like. Hold up, did I agree to this? No I wasn't drunk last night. So I kindly play it off as if our ocs don't know eachother in public chat. She then tried to force the memory out of it. I literally had a friend dm me if I needed help. I said yes, if you could help me that would be great. So she did what she could and bullet was dodged....for now.\n\nSo she disappears for 2 months due to irl or something else. So a couple friends of mine wanted to try a public rp chat again. My friend (Who is a dude by the way. A very relaxed guy as well) joined with his female oc who is asexual and would commit war crimes for food. Now this is where it became bad. The same girl appeared again, and after some tike and interaction with said friend wanted to throw hands with her oc and that of my friends because again. She claimed me and I didn't agree. So after a while and a purposeful rp lock (Rp lock is when you interact with an oc but disappear. Having to make them wait. This can take a few hours or a month which is why we made a 24 hour rule) so I said screw it, undid the rp lock and tried to salvage it but at that time my glass was more than half full of the many gripes I had with the rp chat and adding that didn't make it better. \n\nSo this is where you would expect it to be done. I made a new rule that you can't force romance between ocs for men as well. Never knew I would have to. But this wasn't the end. I decided to give her a second chance. You know, fresh start. First rp was a bit too smutty for my liking. But when the opening was done she translated my public chat excuse into a private Canon. I was done. I did not know how to deal with it so I blocked her after some advice from my friends. She tried to publicly call me out why I blocked her once but a dude jumped in and said I never have to justify any of it to her. \n\nTLDR: Woman translates private chat into public chat and throws fisticuffs with any female oc she finds to close to mine and tries to force romance.",

            "selftext": "So...I was trying a roleplay where I am an ancient Roman woman who is disguised as a man within a Legion and it was just...The guy didn't even try, whom I will call \"Jesse\" for sake of anonymity. For a start, after he added me on the application we were using, I instantly accepted his request and replied - it took three days for him to reply. Then we set it up and started playing:\n\n**Me:** *Near the town of Kyzikos in the Roman province of Asia Minor, camp was set recently - a beacon in middle of the dark of the night. Yet not all legionnaires were within the walls - after all, recon was important and speculatores were sent out. Two miles downstream from Kyzikos, two were walking - one being Julius Decimus, a longtime speculatore who was renowned for his long cloak that shielded his eyes, as well as his introvert behavior and archery skill. He was accompanying a relatively recent arrival, a young patrician. As always Decimus was quiet and standoffish.*\n\n**Jesse:** *I was walking with you. I was quite because I noticed your quite character. Immediately a bear was running to us. He showed us his dangerous tooth. I take my dagger*\n\n**Me:** *\"Malum...\" He cursed under his breath and immediately ran away with all his power - it was no use to stand against a bear, lest of all with merely a bow, quiver and dagger. Sure, Decimus didn't like his life a lot but that did not mean he wanted to die. If the new guy thought himself the hottest shit around...well. He'd soon learn that a bear cared not for a dagger. Decimus kept sprinting, panting, before jumping on top of an olive tree - it was high enough for the bear not to reach the branches. He scratched his palms on the rough branches, getting a few cuts here and there, but soon climbed up top and sat on the main body of the tree*\n\nAlright...let's take a break here. Beyond me writing at least one paragraph and him replying with barely a single line...how does this work? Where and how does a bear suddenly come out running? How does he face a bear with only a dagger?\n\n**Jesse:** *i sneaked to the bear. He was bitting me with his teeth while I put my dagger into his heart. My arm is bloody. Surprised from myself I came back to you and smile proud. You ran and cause of this I can see a bit of your long hairs \u201cAhh\u201d I said interested*\n\nRight, sorry, but I gotta interrupt again. How does someone survive being mauled by a ***bear***? Or how does an Iron Age dagger manage to pierce the fur and ribcage of a bear, which can be penetrated even barely by modern firearms? That's not to add the sheer powergaming here - not even leaving room for me to react to the bear. How does one smile immediately after being attacked by a bear? Or how does he see my \"long hair\" when I quite explicitly said my character has short hair and wears a hood that covers most of her head? I couldn't take it and informed him of these, after which Jesse revised his reply:\n\n**Jesse:** *i was trying to kiss the bear but he forces me down. I was screaming for help as the bear is over me. \u201cHelp. Please help\u201d I scream*\n\n(I really hope that was a typo and he meant kill, not kiss)\n\n**Me:** *He aimed his bow and fired a few arrows in quick succession - obviously they would not kill the bear, but the aim was not that - Decimus wanted to inflict pain and make it run away in confusion. Two hit the bear's back without much effect, but then one his its eye, making it howl out and start to run away in agony, a steady stream of blood running out of its back and leaving a trail. After the bear was out of sight, he ran over to the new guy, unsure if he was alive*\n\n**Jesse:** *i was lying on the floor of the Forrest. Blood is all over my face and for me it was difficult to breathe. I see you and cover my face with my hand \u201cI just wanted to help you\u201d I close my eyes*\n\n**Me:** *\"Help me...why? I was on a bloody tree, you idiot!\" He protested out, starting to drag the injured man back to camp. It'd take an awfully long time, but hopefully he'd expire by a campfire, not in the middle of a forest. Death was not particularly new to Decimus, although how sudden it was...that was a surprise, now. He shook his head, starting to sweat quickly. Cato was much larger than he was.*\n\n**Jesse:** *i Held your cape with my bloody hands and pull it against the floor \u201cHelp me. I Need your help\u201d i grap your Cape with my both strong hands*\n\n**Me:** *\"What the hell do you think I'm trying to do, eh?\" He shouted out, struggling to pull him on the road. By Jupiter, he was already exhausted and it wasn't even quarter the way back to camp...They'd be lucky to reach it by dawn, much less before Cato died from his wounds and blood loss. Perhaps Decimus should just leave him there? No, too suspicious. The least he could do was to try.*\n\n**Jesse:** *We arrived the camp and you put me down at the middle of the camp. I was sweating and full of blood. I close my eyes and everybody stands around of me*\n\nAlright...powergaming again. I had just said we were barely a 1/4 the way back, and I am a much smaller woman trying to carry a larger man. How would it take only that much time? If he wanted to skip, he could just have told me OOC and we'd have planned something out. Or how is he \"full of\" blood when he has been bleeding out after an attack for several minutes straight if not an hour? Why does everyone in the camp of a Roman legion(around 6000 people) stand around a bog-standard injured man?\n\nIn sum...poor communication, short and simple replies, not even reading what I'm posting.",

            "selftext": "SO\nI'd like to know if any of you ever faced this ahah...\n\nBack to when i was 13/14(now i'm 19) i had an online friend which was very cool n great, i believe at the time they were around 18 , surely not younger than it; a great person. I could say i was mature for my age, i browsed a lot interenet 'cause my irl friends of the time were not that much interested in games, movies anf fandoms, i wanted to talk with someone about these interest. I was the typical secondary school fanboy playing FNAF, minecraft and kind-of games. I met this person in a FNAF community and from then we talked on instagram literally daily, about our days , school life and such.\n\nHe did not know my name, i had no photos on my profile, he really hadn't any much info about me, i did care about privacy and was smart enought to undestand how precious such thing was online.\n\nAfter around months of speaking we found out we both really liked developing fictional characters  and because of this we decided to craft a story and start roleplaying.\nIt was good, the story was great and we did write a lot; it definitely taught me much as experience.\n\nFast forward of some months and we do discuss about a possible approach to smut scenes.\nI want to mention, it was a consensual thing, i had no idea how to do it but i somehow knew how sex (barely) worked, and for sure at 13 you're horny and definitely watch *sites* . Our characters were guys, at 13 you're really not still thinking about what you like , at least, i wasn't .\nSo it happened, i believe 3 /4 times maybe.\n\nTo this day, the shame i still have torwards those times is immense. I started cutting out with them growing up, around 16 years old i gave an ultimatum as i kept realizing how toxic the dynamics between us were becoming (this mainly outside of the roleplay scene, but also  inside of it.)\n\n\nI do regret a lot what i did, because damn if i was curious to write smut , and i enjoyed it meanwhile, but to this day i think about some things and details and i'm like \"man wtf\".\nI started feeling uncomfortable some time ago thinking about it, mainly for certain memories. This person sometimes had asked me to do things in the smut scenes i did not understand, and because of this i sometimes said no sometimes said yes even if i was clueless about what he was asking me to do. (He never forced me to do such things, rather a \"what do you think if you did more in *this* way? What about *this* thing?\")\nI do now fully understand what were his request, but at the time i can see why i was confused .\n\nI am ashamed cause i was stupidly horny, and just did things for the sake of doing something i was not supposed to do and enjoying it meanwhile, but to this day, considering the kind of person they turned out to be, i am still somehow disturbed of how i fucked up ahahah...\nI know this person hadn't bad intentions, but on the other hand i wish they thought more about what they were actually doing, 'cause i definitely wasn't.",

One line responses. Horrid grammar. Lack of communication about availability. The whole gamut. And, honestly, none of that really bothered me. At all. Like if I see horrible roleplaying, lack of effort, etc., it\u2019s fun for me because I just troll them right back. Sometimes I almost look for bad roleplayers just to get some laughs. I have a very niche plot, so finding compatible roleplayers is really rare anyway. I generally want a semi-literate to literate roleplay too if I find someone compatible.\n\nBut then last month I met maybe the best roleplayer I had ever seen. A literate roleplayer who could write responses much faster than I and instantly connected with my story. But then he started writing actions for my character. Said at first that it was only as necessary, because he wanted to show effort in his responses, and as all literate roleplayers know, when your responses get too long, you start brushing up against the writing of your partner\u2019s characters. He said it would be minimal at first, but it began getting more and more frequent.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a problem with a side character, but it was my main character who had a very specific personality. I told him that, and he said he\u2019d watch how I played him more, but he never really stopped writing my character.\n\nI guess my issue isn\u2019t so much that he tried writing my character. It was more that I found out through that that he didn\u2019t really understand my character and kept trying to make him something he wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t for lack of effort though \u2014 again, he had magnificent prose with tons and tons of effort. I could see what he meant when he said that writing other people\u2019s characters in literate roleplays is kind of inevitable, unless you want to write five paragraphs describing the weather or something in an action-packed scene. Eventually though, the roleplay began deteriorating, because we both felt that we were sabotaging each other\u2019s character, and of course it ended.\n\nUnlike any bad roleplayer I\u2019ve met, I found this experience so crushing, because we were both actually giving it our best and clicked, and yet the format and medium of roleplaying itself seemed to break us apart.\n\nAfter that, I wanted to take time reading some fanfiction on Archive. I hadn\u2019t done that in a long time ever since I began roleplaying, and I reached an epiphany. I found a 100,000 word or so roleplay in this specific fandom I\u2019m into (basically MxM AOT), and it was the most beautiful story I\u2019d ever seen written. And I knew when I read it that it was something I could never have crafted in a roleplay with another partner, no matter how literate the roleplay. It was something you could only craft with one genius mind that knew exactly how to appeal to an audience like me.\n\nSo I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has had this experience. This is not to say that roleplays can\u2019t be amazing or awesome. It\u2019s just that \u2014 don\u2019t you feel there\u2019s an issue inherent in the medium of roleplaying itself when you finally find the perfect roleplayer? It\u2019s like even if you have the perfect roleplayer, you can\u2019t make the perfect story.\n\nBecause the more effort you put into a literate roleplay, the more you\u2019ll basically be forced to write each other\u2019s characters. And even if you have similar views about your characters, there will always be differences in your perspectives, and that\u2019s going to cause the end for your roleplay eventually.",
