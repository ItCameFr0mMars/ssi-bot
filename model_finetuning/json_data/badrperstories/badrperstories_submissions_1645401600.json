As you do, you have a lot of different conversations, and eventually we got onto the topic of a certain celebrity and one of my favourite movies of theirs. \n\nWell, one of my members dmed me asking if I would be interested in doing a role play based on it. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve never done plots based around already existing media (there might be elements pulled from multiple) but never something like this, since I\u2019m not into fandom role play and prefer it when the plot stays original. \n\nHowever, I was down to give this a go, and I was enjoying it. \n\nAnd then slowly I started losing motivation. They were clearly more into it than I was. They would message me multiple times during the day asking if I was going to reply, despite not being online and knowing I was busy with university (this is *not* saying they were bad for this, but it did somewhat overwhelm me). I did communicate this with them, so they dropped it down to one or two messages when I was home from university. \n\nBut, I was losing motivation and interest, and with uni beginning to stress me out, there were other plots I had going on that I enjoy a lot more and actually want to do role plays with. \n\nSo, earlier I had to message them saying I\u2019m going to need to drop it, and I feel super shitty over it. I have a lot of guilt over it. Plus, they can see me doing scenes within my servers, so I feel really bad over it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the point of this post is, I just wanted to get something out",

            "selftext": "I literally can't stop thinking about this. \n\nI hate how much of a people pleaser I am as well as unable to make my own decisions unless it's to make the other person comfortable. \n\nRecently I took on a Creepypasta roleplay with someone who didn't tell me that a straight relationship roleplay is out if their comfort zone. \n\nWe agreed on OC x OC and they said that they don't have female OCs. After some discussion, I let them pull out a male OC. Which is out of my comfort zone. I don't work well with male OCs. \n\nWe talked about their character and it turned into a discussion just about their oc. Like my oc was brought up once and only as a sent doc.\n\n Next came with headcanons for Canon characters. I like my Roleplays dark and gritty. So the headcanons matched that sort of energy. They sorta just went along with it and were complimenting the character headcanons. \n\nAfter that came the plot and how to start. Again I left this and they only brought ideas of what their oc would do. I was trying to be inclusive for both OCs and canon characters. \n\nWhen the roleplay started, it was ok. Though I found myself sorta leaving my OC in the background because I was portraying two other canon characters  for the start of this plot. And the whole time the three of them would interact and such, they only complimented how I portrayed the Canon characters and sorta left my OC in the dust. \n\nThen they would go on about their OC and the canons I portrayed. \n\nThe more we went into it, I would try pushing my character into the light a bit and again, more OOC about the canons reactions to what if their OC did something and the canons reacted like this. \n\nI was getting a bit upset because it seemed like they were wanting a Canon X OC over the my OC that we agreed on. \n\nI would have been fine if it was brought up in the beginning. Like I'm fine with portraying Canons for someone's oc but only for flf and mlf. But I don't like mlm Roleplays since it makes me uncomfortable. And their OC is male and they were pushing for male canons.\n\n I started getting upset, mostly since my OC was being pushed away and they were wanting to focus on canon character interactions. It hurts a lot. \n\nAnd I felt dumb and petty as well as wanting to cater to their needs. \n\nI straight up said 'i feel like you aren't enjoying any interaction when my OC is around. Do you have a preference for me being a Canon character instead?' \n\nWithout missing a beat: 'who do you want paired with Julia (my OC)?' \n\nLike I said in my post clearly that I don't like doubling. \nI was literally close to crying because I'm forcing myself to step completely out of a comfort zone to keep a good Roleplayer that might be trying to pull one over on me to get what they want. \n\nI said I don't like doubling and I'll just throw Julia to the side. And they started thinking about what canon they wanted for their OC immediately. Like no hesitation. None at all like they were proud they were getting what they wanted. \n\nI'm at a stand still. They keep saying they know I'm not comfortable with MlM and are now wanting to still go\nthrough with it and like trial and error I guess. \n\nThen they pull up something they never brought up on the beginning. That being they aren't comfortable with straight roleplays and they pulled themselves out of their comfort zone for a bit for me. Which makes no sense since my OC barely had any interactions not even remotely romantic since it was just the beginning and I was wanting to Slowburn and develope character since their OC was gonna go through some trials and such. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm so lost and I'm close to like...ghosting and blocking. And I hate doing that but I don't know how to confront this situation anymore. I feel like I've been backed into a corner.",

            "selftext": "Shonen Jump is a popular roleplay scene with Bleach, One Piece or even Dragonball, but there is an issue that causes them to either die before they even get off the ground or contribute to the potential lack of lifespan of these servers. To help clarify some points I talked with someone more knowledgeable in this topic then I am, and most of my points will be paraphrasing them. \n\n# \"Gamerizing\" - The Issue of Systems and Mechanics\n\nGamerizing is the term they coined, and its best described with the following quote:  \n\n**\"I'm not here to play games, I'm here to RP\"**\n\nThe idea is that when people implement game systems into rp servers, it really just adds a level of obligation unintentionally, and does not play on affordances. In actual video games, you can afford to be weaker than someone because it does not effect anything except the difference between the two of you, which can easily be gotten rid of by them playing with you to level you up faster,  you playing more than them. In the end its ultimately irrelevant.  \nBut with RP, the difference in power affects ***everything***: what you can do, who you can do it with, the interactions you have, and the story itself. Being level 3 in an MMO isn't gonna change the story for you if your friend is level 10. Being level 3 in an RP will change how you experience the story if more than 2 people are level 10, usually in a menial and boring way that makes you feel unimportant. There are a few examples which I can list, where **\"Gamerizing\"** can factor in a servers death.\n\n# Hunter x Hunter\n\nThe main issue with Hunter x Hunter is that it **isn't built for RP.** RP servers love structure, and Hunter x Hunter is very heavily anti-structure. In terms of RP, if you really wanna go about it, at least in their advice, the only real way to go about HxH is to not try and control anything too much. This means: **No Events** and **No Streamlining Players**. \n\nWhat Gon and Killua did at the start is vastly different than what Kurapika or Leorio ended up doing, because the point of HxH is that the world is big and ripe with adventure. If you let people separate into friend groups and have their own suitable and narrative adventures, you shouldn't need a system or streamlining, and you shouldn't need powerscaling either.\n\nThat last part is because more then anything, Hunter x Hunter is matchup dependent. There's no point to have hard stats instead of Nen Technique Mastery when so many abilities can outright ignore stats. This is most common when you get into Specialization, Conjuration, and Manipulation. Manipulation as a whole Nen Category is the embodiment of \"stats/power levels don't matter\". \n\n# Nen - \"The Adventure Starts Here\"\n\nNen itself is a big issue in Hunter x Hunter rp, and the root cause of why they end up dying so much. The person talked to summerized the issue as so:  \n\n**\"The fun of Hunter x Hunter is what you do after you have Nen. The problem is that you never get Nen. So you never have fun. So the server dies.\"**\n\nThis is a issue **NO OTHER SHONEN SERIES** has. With say, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball. You got some stuff at the beginning to hold you over until you get into the late game stuff. Hunter x Hunter does not have that.  The entire power system is locked in Hunter x Hunter and that is a problem. This is usually combined with people having to wait for the Hunter Exams, which can take a week or more.  \n\nThis isolates new people, as when servers space their exams out like that, if somebody joins after the exam is over, and there is a waiting period... they deadass can't do anything. They can't rp for basically multiple days, so they leave. Not even My Hero Academia servers make everyone go through Entrance Exams, at least not most of them anyway. \n\nThe solution to this problem is simple: **Allow Nen to be accessed sooner.** It is noted that people can naturally develop an affinity for Nen over time, and during the Exam arc its noted Hisoka had used Nen before officially becoming a Hunter himself, so why not let everyone have that opportunity?\n\n# Dragon Ball Z - The \"Power Level\" Problem\n\nIt is a common problem within Dragon Ball based rps to rely heavily on grinding and power levels, which is another form of Gamerizing that people just been complacent on for a while. It's a flawed system that incentivizes power leveling over actual roleplay, and it makes it hard for those just starting to catch up when people are several levels ahead. We talked earlier about how Gamerizing can be bad for a roleplay environment, and DBZ is just a prime example of how bad it can get. How do we fix this?\n\nWell I have devised something called the **Tier and Saga system**. It is based off a system I only seen once on Discord, and also funnily enough, on ***F-List*** of all places, where the roleplay community does not suffer nearly as much of the issues I have discussed now or prior. Now isn't that embarrassing that a site made almost exclusively for sex has a better power system then most legitimate rp servers.\n\n# Tier and Saga System - How Does It Work?\n\nInstead of using **Power Levels,** your progress will be tracked via **Sagas,** and with certain milestones you gain a **Tier.** Your strength is determined both by your Tier and the Saga you are in, and certain abilities are locked behind certain Sagas. Tiers follow the following ranking system: **Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Rainbow.** Sagas go as follow: **King Piccolo Saga, Frieza Saga, Android Saga, Buu Saga, Super Saga,** and **Legendary Saga.** As you undergo various arcs, journeys and adventures, these caps will rise, and the starting limits will also rise as well. This is how my version of the system looks:  \n ***King Piccolo Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Ordinary Martial Artists and Soldiers, Oolong   \n**Silver:** Red Ribbon Mechs, Mai, Shu, Pilaf   \n**Gold:** Nam, Tien (DB), Krillin (DB), King Piccolo, Mercenary Tao, Roshi   \n**Rainbow:** Goku (End of DB), Piccolo Jr.  \n\n***Frieza Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Raditz, Nappa, Saibamen   \n**Silver:** Vegeta, Goku (Saiyan Saga), Dodoria, Zarbon   \n**Gold:** Goku (Namek Arrival), Vegeta (Frieza Saga), Ginyu Force   \n**Rainbow:** Frieza, Goku (Pre-Transformation), Android 19 and 20  \n\n***Android Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Androids, Piccolo (Fused with Kami), Imperfect Cell   \n**Silver:** Semi-Perfect Cell, Vegeta   \n**Gold:** Vegeta (Cell Games), Trunks, Goku (Cell Games), Bojack   \n**Rainbow:** Perfect Cell, SS2 Gohan, Broly (Non-Canon)  \n\n***Buu Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Dabura, Fat Buu, Majin Vegeta, Goku (SS2)   \n**Silver:** Gotenks, Kid Buu, Goku (SS3)   \n**Gold:** Ultimate Gohan, Super Buu (Gotenks Absorbed), Trunks (Xeno)   \n**Rainbow:** Super Buu (Gohan Absorbed), Vegito  \n\n***Super Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Goku (God), SS4 Goku (GT), SS4 Vegeta (GT)   \n**Silver:** Hit, Caulifla, Kale, Toppo, Gogeta (GT)   \n**Gold:** Kefla, Zamasu, Goku Black, Goku (SSBKK)   \n**Rainbow:** Beerus, Champa, Golden Frieza  \n\n***Legendary Saga***   \n**Bronze:** Goku (Ultra Instinct -Sign-), Vegeta (Royal Blue)   \n**Silver:** Goku (Ultra Instinct), Jiren, Goku (Xeno)   \n**Gold:** Gogeta (Super), Broly (Super), Vegito (Xeno)   \n**Rainbow:** ~~Farmer w/Gun~~ Angels and Zeno \n\n# What About the Transformations?\n\nTransformations and transformation-like techniques, due to the abolishment of Power Levels, grant Tier ups instead. The degree a transformation grants a Tier up is dependent on their strength and what Saga they came from; Ones from earlier Sagas may become less effective in later Sagas.  Transformations are fittingly locked behind Sagas, and you must reach that Saga before you can learn that transformation. Some transformations require you to go and meet certain people in order to learn them as a prerequisite, like King Kai for Kaio-ken. Here is a example of how it may look during the **King Piccolo Saga**:  \n***Oozaru/Great Ape:*** \\+3 Tiers in King Piccolo Saga, +2 in Sayian Saga, and +1 in Frieza Saga. Due to the severe power gaps after this, the Oozaru Form loses its usefulness.  \n\n***Max Power (Humans Only):*** \\+2 Tiers for 3 turns, but then -1 Tier for 3 turns due to fatigue. \n\n**Four Witches Technique (Triclopses Only):** \\+1 Tier when used, can be stacked with other forms.  \n\n**Eight-Arm Fist:** \\+1 Tier when used, can be learned by anyone but is only useful against someone equal to or below them in Tier.  \n\n**One-Hundred Arms (Namekians Only):** \\+2 Tier when used, but loses its effectiveness against those higher then them in Tier.  \n\n**Sneezing Disorder (Humans Only):** \\+1 to Tier while in Bad Side, but loses it in Good Side. \n\n**Great Namekian (Demon Clan Namekian Only):** \\+2 to Tier when used but takes +2 damage due to the strain of going into this form. \n\nThese Tier ups really matter for those weaker or equal to their opponent, as it can make or break if you are gonna win or not without resorting to some cheese (like Solar Flares). It keeps things fair while allowing those on the lower end to never feel like they can't catch up or compete. This solves the whole power leveling problem, and if more servers adopted this we'd be in a better place.\n\n# One Piece - The Problem with Crews\n\nOne Piece's main issue is that its often hard to form a crew. In fact its hard to form a team in roleplay at all, even in DnD where you have a bit more control over team composition and whatnot, making a team that doesn't somehow impode on itself is a real challange. DnD however has the benefit of you just having a select few people whom you communicate with frequently. Standard Discord rp is more like jumping into quickplay lobby and hopping the randoms your paired with don't fuck up your game. \n\nMaking a good team is important. Yet there is alot of issues with this. Usually the format is that you can't progress unless you reach a certain level, and have a certain number of people on your crew. The issues lie in multiple factors: The activity of every single member, wither the members synergize at all, wither their goals line up, and even if they had a Devil Fruit or not, as some captains may want more non-DF users so that they got people who can salvage things if their DF users got fucked somehow.\n\nSatisfying every single one of these conditions are important. And that's a lot to ask for. It's akin to having several groups of players at a DnD session at once, and hoping the teams formed don't go sideways. It can really drag a rp when you are daisychained to someone else, and reliant on them to get stuff moving, as just one person being out of the loop can mess it up for the whole group. And sad to say, I don't really see a way to really fix this. It's more a matter of people rather then the system itself, and its just something servers focused on One Piece is going to have to deal with.  \n\n\nThat's all my rambling for tonight. Do you agree with some things? Disagree on others? Don't be afraid to talk about it down below, and please keep it civil.",

We are both pretty decent writers and the character they\u2019re playing is engaging, but meanwhile in one of the ooc chats I\u2019m talking with Tim and Tim happens to refer to me by a name which I am uncomfortable with, this name seemed more suited for a lover than a stranger so I politely tell Tim I don\u2019t like names like that can you please not refer to me as such?\nLater on as soon as I reply back to our rp Tim dms me..\nThey want to call off our rp because they\u2019re \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with how I dealt with the name situation, at the time I didn\u2019t know what this was all about, I simply say fine but it\u2019s upsetting..\nAfter our rp is closed, I message Tim again asking what specifically made them uncomfortable about me telling them off, they told me oh it\u2019s how you dealt with it. How I dealt with it? What? I dealt with it just fine by telling Tim off nicely, but what peeves me is they tell me specifics after our rp is over, and well we can\u2019t continue it now.. the fact Tim decided to cancel our rp instead of talking things out as we did after is my problem because after explaining how that name made me uncomfortable we went on our merry ways.\n\nStory two:\nBefore Tim joined two friends and I were coming up with a plot for our characters, it included theirs as well as my character obv, then Tim joins..\nI kept waiting and waiting for my friends and this rp that never happened the reason? Friend a forgot the plot included me and instead replaced me with Tim in the plot. I\u2019m not mad at my friend forgetting but it did upset me, friend b remembered I was supposed to be in the plot but didn\u2019t say anything ab it, but in short Tim stole my role in the plot, I am upset about this not only cause this was OUR plot but because after Tim called off our rp he takes the role in mine with my friends.\n\nEveryone else seems to like Tim but me, do I have a right to not like them? Or am I just being petty?\n\nThanks for reading.",

And since I am an adult, why not try ERP too?\n\nMy idea of ERP (or RP in general, really) is to find someone, write a story, have fun, then call it a night. Maybe add them to my contacts if we found some nice writing chemistry between us.\n\nSo I meet some guy who's into the same stuff that I am and he's very friendly about it.\nWe start writing a smut story. Good. It's all going smoothly.\nWe come to the end of the 'session' (I called it off because I had no more time) and IMMEDIATELY this guy asks me for some pictures.\n\nI tell him straight as an arrow: I'm not interested in sexting/e-dating. I just want to RP/ERP. I'm not interested in real life.\n\nBut he kept pushing and pushing.\nAt some point he even drops a, and I quote, \"but I want things to get personal with my kitten\". I'm not joking. He even said the damn meme buzzword and he was dead serious.\n\nHonestly, I ghosted him after that. But it's because I have no idea what to say. Do I block him? Do I repeat myself?

It sucks because the posts show up on my profile, but not on the sub. I know it's not a shadowban thing in these subs because I've checked manually, some things have gone through fine, and I've asked a mod in one of the subs about it. I've noticed I'm not seeing as many ads from other people as well, but I don't know if that's in my head. Has anyone else been running into this problem?",

            "selftext": "Hello all. So, I've been writing for thirteen years now for both roleplay and stories I'd create. Back in 2015, I first jumped onto Reddit because I was recommended by a friend of mine at the time to transition from some Kik Roleplay websites and onto here. I found a few subreddits, but the one I frequented for about two years (until the demise of that account) is now labeled at the Voldemort subreddit. It was peaceful, I made many friends from there and still have friends from the posts I made. Many who helped me grow with my developing character. However, after the original mod/owner stepped down, it was as if a wolf-in-sheeps-clothing took over. I still have the email of them calling me a snowflake for mentioning that 'neko' (what I called my oc's species at the time) or some fandom titles being censored/removed via automod was stupid, which I'll add below. Sure, I cursed a lot at the time, because it was what it was. Ignorance, and that pissed me off.\n\nAfter getting my account reported to the Redd staff because they had a fragile ego, I made a new account months later and moved on. ...Kinda. I made a new subreddit making fun of them, stating that it was a subreddit for any and all types of writers, SFW, NSFW, whatever. Afterwards, I decided to vent my frustrations thoroughly by getting a vpn for my old phone and creating at least ten burner emails to spam the cursed subreddit with, to warn others about the abuse and so they could go elsewhere.\n\nIronically enough, a year after, I posted to said subreddit a few times after and the mod seemed to learn their lesson, as they answered me with surprising politeness when wanting my auto-removed posts back on, explaining what I did wrong or what I had to change. I dunno about how it is now, I won't touch it even with a ten foot hand stick so I can type. But, there's another subreddit following in its' footsteps as a Voldemort 2.0, but with even worse people. If a mod, or anyone in general, calls themselves a: \"Supreme Leader\", that mod is power hungry and has an ego so far up their arse, it's spilling out their nose.\n\nI'm TOO, and I hope you enjoyed my TedTalk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3or6uedo4k81.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f3a0e6da7ba5d3953b944bb8ce3954ac08626a5",

            "selftext": "Hi! So I\u2019m looking for a bit of writing advice for Rp characters. So for context my usual go to is characters who are more on the emotional side of things. Maybe they have a short temper, maybe they are super bubbly and talkative, maybe their super cocky and confident. Point is my main experience comes in writing how the character feels and having my characters have bigger reactions to things. Problem is that kinda gets in the way if I want to write a more serious, colder, or emotionless character. I never know how to fill in the blanks for what their thought process is, and often times what was supposed to be a more stoic character ends up getting warped to a more emotional based one by accident as I go.\n\nSo my question is how do you write  a more serious, stoic, and/or less emotion-based character and yet still keep them interesting and fun to write as?",

I got bored and there weren't many replies, I go to a Japanese visual erotica sight (if you know you know) and posted some refs and allowed any and all lusty sorts into my dms. This one chap had found my literate rp and had made an application in chat while I was getting quite a few more replies for the hentai post. Reddit didn't notify me and I was sadly oblivious to this young man's application. The next day I was busy all day and never went on reddit. The day after, I checked my chat and noticed a stray application. \n\nThe application was absolutely stunning. His writing was gorgeous and his idea, while a little basic, was still very satisfactory. But after his application was a rather heated accusation from him that I had ghosted him by not replying. Apparently I was outrageously rude for not replying to him. I  responded by saying i didnt see his message, complimented him on his idea and writing, but said I was a little concerned on his perception on what ghosting actually is. He then came back at me even more aggravated and said I had killed the rp when it just started (which is utter fucking nonsense, it didn't even start because I only just read it and I don't belive application=acceptance). I then stopped the conversation there.\n\nBig question is, is not responding to an application ghosting?",

A lot of it is the classic of the writer can't spell, can't punctuate, can't use grammar. A lot of it too is the unfortunate reality of dealing with lazy writers, uncreative ones, and personally despicable ones. \n\nThough as much as I find cases of legitimately terrible roleplayers, I see a lot of cases where it's a weird and miniscule thing blown out of proportion or it's a total lack of common sense and understanding? I'd like to relate this to the rules of the road for a second. Ideally we obey the signs that everyone else sees, from the common stop sign to the stop light. However, sometimes we're on roads that have neither or that don't even have defined lanes. At that point we have to use common sense. Don't recklessly speed, look both ways, prepare for the unexpected.\n\nIdeally, be a defensive driver. \n\nRoleplaying is a bit like that. It sucks when we have a shitty encounter, but at a certain point you can prevent or reduce the amount of bullshit you have to deal with. That and well, understand some bullshit is inevitable. \n\n**Ghosting is a norm and complaining about it is like complaining about shitty weather.** \nYou can yell at snow and rain and wind all you want, but it legitimately doesn't care. You can make every case in the book regarding human decency, standards, being the change you want to see but the reality is it will happen and getting angry about it doesn't help anyone. The spiteful message you send ghosters will have the same effect you telling people not to ghost you will, which is nothing. It's something that we all should learn to take with a grain of salt. Consider yourself lucky if you get a Dear John letter. I say this not out of spite but as a someone tired of hearing from others it's cold when it's winter. \n\n**Asking for pictures, hearing your voice, or anything personal beyond your age if NSFW is involved is not normal and not required.** People who ask for this stuff ( age excluded for stated reason ) are not people you need or should entertain with such information. Most likely, they want more then RP and you satisfying any condition is asking for trouble. Nationality, beliefs religious or political, physical appearance, voice, and arguably even gender have little to nothing to do with cooperative writing. Inspirations they can be sure and I'm not saying you shouldn't share if you get along with your partner down the road. However if they state this as a requirement, it's absolutely not and they're being a little shit and you're digging yourself into a hole.\n\nMy only side-note to this is that I understand why a lot of women dislike male writers and it's fine. I did a stint once of playing solely female characters and a lot of guys were just absolutely atrocious in my DMs. Not all were bad, but a lot of them did the shit I outlined in the paragraph above. \n\n**Blowing up private messages is not chill.** Stop, get some help. If someone is constantly asking where you are 24/7 or is constantly hitting the enter key before you can even type, get out. These people usually will never chill and begin to rely on you for attention. If you even think of stepping away, boy howdy they'll blow a gasket and usually threaten to commit self-harm because nothing gets empathy and attention more then threats of self-destruction. Instead of making this a seperate section I'll include it here: **Mental health is not you or your RP's partner's responsbility.** While it should be **respected**, they do not exist to solve your problems nor do you to solve theirs. We are nerds writing as knights, mafia, princesses, super heroes, canon characters from fiction, or vikings that strongly and suspiciously look like Henry Cavill. Unless a degree is waved, nobody is qualified nor responsible to aid the mental health of another. Stop encouraging them, you know you didn't sign up for this.\n\n**Anyone that complains constantly of not being able to find partners is usually the problem.** This might grind some gears but I can't deny this is a legit issue. I've sat down and spoke to these people and they'll give me the usual responses of 'people are too elitist, there are too many tribes, nobody is good enough for me'. Notice a trend? For some reason, the fault is never their own. These are also the types that can be: incredibly hostile for no reason, are only interested in obscure interests or fandoms, are creepy as hell, or NEVER APPROACH PEOPLE. Roleplaying is and always will be about mutual exchange. If nobody wants to role-play with you, think about why and what exactly you're offering. It's a buyer and seller game.\n\n**If you see the warning signs and ignore them, it's not exclusively the fault of the other anymore.** I know people that love drama, that feed off it whether it's done to them or someone else. He'll, I feel we're all here to live vicariously through other people's drama. Share, tell, sing it from the heavens, but just know at a certain point you're feeding it. Bad role-players exist, absolutely, but you're dangerously reaching their level when you're playing into it and know better.\n\n**'Hey wanna RP' out of the blue and without context is a clear indication that you're going to have a bad time and ignoring it makes you at fault.**  If you're the type like many of us who put up an ad that has explicit ideas and themes and you get this is as a response, you know what I mean. The 'Hey wanna RP' person did not read your ad, will only skim it if you ask them to, and will agree with whatever you say only to give you one line responses. When you deny them you're going to feel smug, big brained, thinking maybe they learned a lesson? They didn't, they won't, and they absolutely will do it again to someone else and if they get ghosted or blocked they'll assume you're rude. \n\nThey will never stop, they are the Boomhauer of RP. You will remember this annoyance and they will forget about it the moment they enter someone else's DMs. Stop feeding the animals.\n\n\n~\n\nThis is longer then I wanted but there ya go. Hot takes, some of ya'll ask for the trouble you get, give downdoots or updoots, agree or disagree. Just make sure you realize a bad role-play story and a story of you slamming your head into a wall repeatedly for laughs is two different things. Also if you're new to the hobby feel free to exclude yourself from the accusation until you've truly experienced the hamster wheel of RP.\n\ntl;dr = ya'll can't read the signs and are acting a bit too innocent, might be the bbeg.",

            "selftext": "I have joined a roleplay server I was recommended by one of my roleplaying buddies. Posted an ad that I am seeking a roleplay at the end of January. Posted a few plot ideas. Even also described the characters I am using to roleplay. Received a few bites and started roleplaying with at least two people. And a few days ago someone messaged me saying they enjoyed my writing sample, and would love to roleplay based off an idea that I've suggested. I didn't mind taking in another roleplaying partner.\n\nI said I am open to NSFW themes. We also discussed our kinks/anti-kinks before we even began writing.\n\nThey said they could start us off and I did not mind it. It was nice for a change since usually I am the one who starts every time. And well, I didn't reply after receiving that starter. It started with zero building, right off the bat, with our characters having anal sex (what!). And he also included scat (yes, I am not kidding), mentioning my character shitting herself underneath. I did the unthinkable and blocked this person. I know that ghosting will never be an excuse but I felt like my boundaries were crossed.\n\nI am appalled. I've been roleplaying for almost two decades and this never happened to me. I know some people have /interesting/ fetishes. However we always discuss things before we even begin writing and make clear we're on the same page.\n\nIt was way too well-written to be a troll.",

I was in a scene with three of them today and I really couldn't keep up. Their writing is phenomenal. They write a *lot* but absolutely none of it is filler. They write these well thought out, and absolutely awe inspiring characters that they seem to be able to flesh out and create in a matter of hours. They have immersive imagery, brilliant and unique metaphors, and interesting character choices. They story plot like nothing I've ever seen, connecting the dots to link the characters, and give them all motivation. \n\nBesides that I love writing with them. They're considerate, they respect boundaries, they ask if they need to control my characters (even though at this point they really don't need to) they don't auto hit, or show boat, all of their characters have flaws, and they can have their characters do things they themselves don't agree with because the characters are not them/their self inserts. And no one is ever butt hurt over in character stuff ooc! I could keep going, but basically they're just the best group ever. \n\nThe problem is, I don't feel like I can keep up. I worry my stuff is repetitive or very dry. I can write ok, I mean I think my writing is fine, but I don't really think it's jaw dropping like theirs is. Their stuff is novel quality, and I know they won't call themselves novella level but honestly they are. I want to improve so I can at least feel like I'm keeping pace, where is a good place to start? I've always gotten better at things by just doing them over and over, but I feel like writing needs a little more studying than that. Can anyone recommend some jumping off points?",

Like portraying Canon characters for their OCs since I see that's a really popular want of others. \n\nBut lately I've just been getting requests for super smutty roleplays, one liner responders and people who demand things that I list as a hard and absolute no in my rules and preferences. \n\n\nI tried going back to RPNation and my ad was heavily edited because the guidelines wouldn't except my search of dark themed roleplays. It's turned into more of a place to cater to minors and beginner roleplayers. \n\nAnd here on Reddit, the subreddits I'm in, I'm finding no one but extremely horny people and incest obsessed people that make my skin crawl. \n\nI'm really in the need for some places that will allow me to post in search of Dark themed roleplays(creepypasta, slashers, yandere) and slight nsfw elements(not just sexual themes but more detailed bloody and Gorey with psychological and thriller horror) without my posts getting deleted. \n\nIf anyone could list some sites or discord servers where ei can post my ads in peace with no issue and maybe find like-minded people, that would be really appreciated. \n\nThank you so much!",

            "selftext": "RP is not a hobby most young people today feel like they'd get engaged in. It generally requires more attention span, more sitting down, less imagery, etc. Something I've noticed with teens now is they're far more likely to RP on an MMO than do text-based roleplay over Discord. And that's fine! One's not better than the other.\n\nBut it does explain why you kiddies are not finding partners. \n\nThere's this overwhelming opinion that RP is something you 'grow out of' and that those of us who have been here since the AOL days are the 'old fogies' and in the minority. In my opinion that's simply not true. There seem to be far more old, crusty 20-30 year olds than teens in this hobby no matter what server you poke your head into. Just check reddit ads and the vast proportion of them are adults looking for other adults.\n\nThis is not a dying hobby. It's a hobby enjoyed mostly by adults who have been doing it for years, and you simply have to wait a few until you're old enough to participate.",

It's impossible to reflect on my character's masked thoughts and feelings without being immediately called out. \n\nIt's a silly thing to get frustrated over, but man, mind readers make it difficult to plot and play sometimes.

I saw this person\u2019s writing style, and I studied the type of person she was from her OOC. So I asked her \u201cYou seem so familiar, have I met you before on a different account. You remind me of this girl who is similar to you, but I didn\u2019t enjoy the roleplay as much, so I ended things.\u201d And she told me that I was right. This really annoyed me. She can\u2019t leave me alone. She comes up with this fake name, and mind you, this is the third account and persona that she\u2019s added me on. She also faked being a person of color, saying she\u2019s experienced racism, but I\u2019ve seen pictures of her, and I know that\u2019s not true at all. Always trust your gut!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m very new to Reddit and here in general so my apologizes if this post somehow messes up. I have been rping for about 7 years now and have found myself in a somewhat slump of indecision. \n\nI have a rp partner who I\u2019ve been rping with for a bit now, and everything was going great! We responded back to each other within like 20 minutes each time the first few weeks (which I know is very hard to find because people have lives, and that\u2019s okay!). We would give each other fair warnings if we could that we wouldn\u2019t be on for a day or two if we just got caught up in work, life, etc. if we didn\u2019t warn prior we would at least fill each other in after the fact. \n\nBut now suddenly that has plummeted drastically on their end. Now they take days to respond and give no warnings or \u2018my bad i was doing __\u2019. This started about two to three weeks ago. I\u2019m not an impatient person whatsoever, but it\u2019s just confusing when you were used to great communication and replies and suddenly it\u2019s went down. I know they have other roleplays going on and I find myself wondering if they\u2019re ignoring me for days on end because of new roleplays. I hate to think like that and be stuck in a weird limbo because I really did/do enjoy the rp but I worry this may be their way of subtly kicking me to the side and focusing on other rps instead? \n\nI completely understand life can get hectic very suddenly and maybe they just don\u2019t want to discuss it with someone over the Internet, which is why I haven\u2019t brought this up or anything to them. I am just interested in hearing others opinions and if I should kindly mention that if they wanted to end the rp it would be okay? I\u2019d really rather us both come to a mutual agreement to end it rather than them just slowly ghosting me and losing interest (if that\u2019s the case). Maybe other people that have been in a similar situation could offer advice and help? I\u2019d really appreciate it!",

This person was in the same friend group as me and while we were chatting we discovered both of us liked Dream SMP. First, we roleplayed in that group making the classical ships Dream x George, Badboyhalo x Skeppy and etc. After some time this person opened a DM group with just me and her. She said \"We are going to do some aus nothing much\" It was simple at first, some school AUs and shit but then the fetishes and stuff got weirder! Usage of some tools (even bananas) and lots of things. I tried not RPing with her by simply telling her \"I'm busy\" or \"I'm sick\" but she was guilt-tripping about me saying, \"Oh..I miss her.\" etc. Whenever I was sad or something she would just say \"Oh! Let's make you feel better\" and eventually ping me in our RP DM group and I couldn't say \"No\" because she would kick me out of every single friend group of mine. Luckily she found a new RP partner in the summer of 2021 so now I'm free.",

            "selftext": "Hey, I  wanted some advice from this sub since y'all know what bad roleplaying looks like (I do too) and was wondering where to get a fresh start in role-playing and what you guys would suggest for preparing for roleplaying outside of a fandom space?\n\nFor context, I gave up roleplaying with anyone but my closest friends, usually DND nowadays, after a long period of very abysmal roleplays connected to the Danganronpa fandom present on Discord and Amino. I won't name servers or communities but suffice to say I won't be going back to the fandom. Namely because people seem to always play the same character- Nihilistic tragedy of a person who is happy when others are dead, sad, or ignored.\n\nI always prefer to play optimistic people. Because my allotted period of self loathing and nihilism has long since passed and I no longer find comfort in repairing angst, misery, and playing therapist to other people's characters. Which usually meant these edgy kids unaware of how they are just making themselves the main character of a new wave \"My Immortal\" hated to interact with me. They also hated complexity in characters and even a diverse range of appearances which meant I'd always have a target on my back for not looking like or acting like everyone else there.\n\nTL:DR - Danganronpa kids ruined roleplaying for me, so if you have advice on getting into fully original and fandom disconnected roleplay I'd GREATLY appreciate it!",

            "selftext": "So yesterday I replied to a post and eventually we moved over to discord. We talked for a little while before one of my other partners responded to me.   \n\n\nThey hadn't been able to roleplay for the past week and only had a two hour window to roleplay that day. Which was great because I was free during that time. This was a roleplay where it was normal to go over the discord character limit once if not twice in a response. Only occasionally having posts that didn't have as much writing. I quickly read through their reply and respond. All together it takes me 20-25 minutes to respond, even though I'm quick at typing the length is what took so long. After that I decide to make myself a quick breakfast while they are responding to me. Then when I started eating they responded so I wrote back. This entire thing between the two replies and making breakfast maybe took an hour, give or take a few minutes.   \n\n\nI had gotten about 7 or 8 different messages from the person who's post I responded. Short little messages sent as a way to try and get my attention. I wasn't happy about this. What if an emergency came up? And I would've been gone for 6+ hours. I don't have a doubt in my mind they would've sent messages over and over again the whole time. So I tell them I didn't appreciate all the messages and then I explained why I was away for an hour. They tell me that I should've communicated that. I tried explaining why I didn't. It was because I didn't know I was going to be away for an hour, and secondly I couldn't wait on making breakfast, I had to take my medication and I can't do that on an empty stomach.   \n\n\nAfter some back and forth and being told all reddit roleplayers are stuck up, he just wanted to move on and get on with the roleplay. All he was saying the entire time we went back and forth was that I should've communicated I was going to be away. I DIDN\"T KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE AWAY FOR AN HOUR IN THE FIRST PLACE! I told him I didn't want to roleplay with him and felt we weren't a great match, he went off on me before blocking me. I dodged a bullet I guess.   \n\n\nAm I in the wrong for not telling him I'd be away for a bit, when I didn't think I would be away for more than 30 minutes? Sure, had I known it'd be an hour or more I would've said something. I also don't feel like I should've had to argue my medication and mental well being is more important than letting him know I'd be away a while.  Any thoughts?",
