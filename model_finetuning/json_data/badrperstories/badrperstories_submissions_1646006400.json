Every time I post an ad I am all but guaranteed three or four people that:\n\n\\-Have not read the ad\n\n\\-Read the ad, read one of my 'no's, and think they are the exception\n\nBy far the most common one is my age cutoff. I have it bolded and underlined NOT to contact me if you are under a certain age. I am not going to be nice to someone who comes into my DMs, knows they're disregarding a boundary, and chooses to do it anyway. That shows me they do not respect me or my time, and so the response they are going to get is 'why did you think it was okay to approach me with a violation of my boundaries?'\n\nI am extremely polite and reasonable if someone just isn't a match. I am not polite or reasonable when someone sees I have a boundary and ignores it. That's just blatant disrespect of me as a person.\n\nNot to mention all the creeps, people who come to me with other things I said no to, etc. It's not that much work to read an ad before you reach out to someone.\n\nEndrant.",

            "selftext": "I was reading another post that completely summarizes what I'm about to say. Most people get \"sex ed\" from hentai or porn in general. I'll dive a bit deeper I suppose, as deep as you can go for 2 turns.\n\nSo this no OC in a server I'm in DMs me if a character of my was free, I asked them what they meant by that and they meant like relationship. The character they were talking about wasn't one of my main OCs or.. I had never used them in the server but they knew about her? (Maybe searching by Gender: Female in the approved channel) so I was kinda y'know 2 \"Eh, might be able to start a neat irp relationship with this person's character.\"\n\nThat's where I was wrong, they went to kinks and all straight away, I told them my character didn't really have any kinks but was fine with others'. A bit before we started the current rp they asked \"Cup size and ass size?\" I don't give my characters set descriptions for their.. areas, the server I usual is more action-y intense. I say that last part lightly because it's a JJBA server with Godzilla as its main character. (ERP is against the rules in-server hence why the person DM'd me)\n\nI also realised a bit too late that this guy didn't want a casual relationship with some ERP, they had said themself \"Ah, were you okay with nsfw?\" \"*Just for future reference\"* I had assumed they meant y'know, when the characters started to know eachother a bit more. Nope!\n\nSo back to earlier, I had set the scene and all first turn, and naturally this person responds next.. Their character sits next to mine, not knowing them, lifts up her skirt, and says something about how she's so beautiful and needs to put her body to work.. I- I was kind of shocked. That's.. I'm fairly sure that's sexual assault..\n\nI would've said no but I really like the server I'm in and would really hate for them to lose a member, even if it was that guy. Welp, time to respond",

The advice could be used for many of us who are just over the creepy roleplayers, since I know I\u2019m not alone in being this over and annoyed with it. I always say that I\u2019m alright with nsfw as long as it\u2019s only a part of the rp, not half of it and not a majority of it, a part. Creepo translation for that however must be \u201cnsfw every day, every night, all the time!\u201d I\u2019m really done with it and I\u2019ve tried to be nice and just block the creeps, point out that this isn\u2019t what I wanted, etc.",

If we're doing noble X bodyguard I obviously expect you character's royal ass to want to clear the family's name\\grow stronger\\get to that diplomatic mission\\whatever, otherwise this isn't an adventure RP, it's just a really weird debate where my character is trying to convince your character to be an active part of the story rather than a passive potato chained to the plot train",

You can't grow through loss, you can't train to become better, you can't even really form other character connections because they're so over the top they bother other characters and their writers. Once again a new person search reveals just how many people like to be king cong. What are they getting out of it? They give attitude when they get told no, but how can they expect to have a long lasting storyline if they won't match the setting? Some of my favorite characters I've played were a little underpowered, I like them because they have to struggle more to get where the other characters are. Obviously they aren't for everyone but why go to the extreme? Do they honestly not understand that they are trying to ruin a story everyone else enjoys? It's so rude, it feels like they're turning everyone else into background characters but why? If you're gonna get annoyed at everyone else for existing write by yourself.",

Then you're probably going to come off as a creep to women or at the very least make them hesitant. \n\nI see a lot of posts here and elsewhere from men wondering why they're not getting any takers... and this is why. Everyone has their own level of comfort, of course, and so RPing with other men might just not be your thing, but please keep in mind that women are subjected to a lot of creeps in this hobby who want to use them for sexual gratification, sapphic people especially. If that's not you, great. \n\nI just wanted to put it out there why this is a thing that happens, because I feel a like a lot of cishet men are very genuinely confused about it. Unfortunately, because of an abundance of bad actors in the hobby and just life and misogyny in general, this is why. Vulnerable genders just want to have fun in this hobby. We want to feel safe. We trust others to be respectful and a lot of times, that trust gets violated.",

            "selftext": "I consider trying a non-fandom English original RP for the first time ever. I played in English fandoms and in original RPs in my native language, but never both.\n\nI haven't  decided on a platform yet and I'm not planning to start for another 2-3 months anyway, but I'd like to be prepared. \n\nI have several concerns: \n\n1) English is my second language, and no matter how good I am, there are going to be mistakes or typos. I don't know, how to avoid this. I don't know, if I should.\n\n2) I want RP to be flexible, word-count wise. I can write several paragraphs easily, but from experience it doesn't always look good if I stick to designated post length too strictly. Sometimes 5 sentences before or after longer posts do far better job, than roughly same length. Personally, I accept any replies, from one word and up as long as it a) makes sense b) contributes to the RP and actually prompts something to happen. Of course, I want something similar as my partner. But everyone on Reddit seems to take word-count very seriously. Is something like that even possible?\n\n3) Ideally, I'd like to make character on spot, not necessarily from scratch, but still. I may have years of positive experience in that aspect, but I imagine not many people would be thrilled by the perspective. \n\n4) I want my story to potentially include romance as a sub-plot, but I'm not sure how to go about it, since I don't want the story to be set in the stone, and I am really into the slow burn. Like, month to years irl time type of slow burn, with lots of gen, friendship and world-building preferably. It leaves me conflicted. If, say, I'd write an ad mentioning romance, people would expect stuff happen much-much sooner and with guarantee. If I don't mention romance at all, I don't think it would be possible create cozy, safe and pleasant storyline, since it would require for characters to get along really well. Not to mention gender and sexualities of our characters should match for them to be romantically involved.  What should I do?\n\n5) If romance part goes really well, I'd like, of course, have some NSFW elements included, but again, not guaranteed. And I often like these parts to be... Stylised and not overly graphic, more emotions and touches than any bodily fluids. From what I gather SFW vs NSFW RP decision is pretty straightforward. And I have no idea, which one it will be in any particular case.\n\n6) If it will include NSFW and certain topics, concerning my characters preferences, statuses and personality, it would probably require disclosure of some details about myself. I don't want to trust any random stranger with that information. But is it possible to build a relationship, where partners just feel mutually safe? What do I need to keep in mind? How to discuss triggers, kinks, boundaries, mental health, etc?\n\n7) I'd like the schedule to be very relaxed, but don't want my partner to feel abandoned or, alternatively, pressured to write faster. I want to have sessions where we are writing days and nights and the ones, where we turn up once a week, with both being norm.\n\n8) What I should be looking for in a partner? Adult, definitely. Female, likely, judging from the horror stories I see there, even though it feels weird to exclude a whole bunch of people, based solely on their gender. What else is important to consider?\n\nAll in all I currently feel like a walking red flag, or, at least someone, who wants too much from RP. Should I lower my expectations?\n\nAny advices, rants, vents, stories will be appreciated.",

I always want to make things as immersive as possible for the other person, I come up with ideas and npc's to play against their characters and I end up feeling so burnt out and left out... Like I know everything that's going to happen because I'm the one coming up with all the ideas. I never get to be surprised by anything, I never just get to play my characters blind, I'm always catering to others. This part isn't gonna sound good, but I always feel like my ideas connect better because I always write with the \"this happens BECAUSE\" rather than just running with \"and then this happens\". I always try and relate things back to previous parts in the game or different characters points and I'm tired of feeling like no one is ever doing this for me. This sounds really dumb, idk. I just wish I didn't always feel like the GM in 1x1 games. It'd be nice to just get to play a character rather than pulling all the legwork sometimes. I've got multiple games with the same person and it feels like this for every game.. And I've brought it up to zero success. Idk.",

We had a plot we both liked, everything was so normal and then, with absolutely no warning, he asked if I like sex. Completely out of nowhere. And it surprised me enough to ask him if he was drunk or on something and he said he was completely sober. There was nothing in our messages or his ad that suggested he would be like this. Stupidly, I kept messaging him thinking that it was just a fluke. Maybe it was a bad night, but the vibe completely changed after that and I'm drafting up my \"this isn't going to work out\" message.\n\nI can't figure out how to post a screenshot as well as text on the mobile app so I'll post the picture in the comments.

I freaked out, like did the owner call it quits or did I get kicked out from the current RP AND the archive for something I wasn\u2019t aware of? Nope, owner decided it was futile and just deleted the servers. At least let us save a few things before you wipe the damn thing from existence?

            "selftext": "To those unaware, the very basic definition of doubling is when you play a specific character/character type for your partner, and your partner plays a specific character/character type for you. You end up with two pairs as a result: one that aligns more with what you want, and the other that fits your partner's desires. This can be, but isn't always, canon/oc. In this particular vent, both pairs are oc/oc.\n\nCommon courtesy with doubling is that you try to pay equal attention to *both* sides. This can mean trying to make the length of both of your replies as equal as possible, or making sure that both pairs have their own mini-plots set within the grand scheme of the roleplay.\n\nOKAY, SO. Apologies in advance for my attempt at acronyms. I'm trying to keep this post relatively easy to follow (though I might have failed).\n\nI've recently started a RP with a new partner, and things were kind of imbalanced from the beginning. If we label Pair A as my partner's desired pair and Pair B as my desired pair, it's been like...\n\n**Pair A (A-OC):** Strong, fast focus on the romance from the very beginning. Not my style, but it's what my partner wanted, so I went with it! No particular issues here.\n\n**Pair B (B-OC):** My partner will sometimes spend maybe 60-90% of their reply...talking to my character about their *own* character from Pair A. One of their B-OC's first full conversations with my B-OC was about their A-OC's backstory. Mind you, there is *no connection* between my B-OC and their A-OC at all! So it's essentially been like someone coming up to talk to you about the entire traumatic history of a stranger who you've never met or care about.\n\nI've tried to gently bring it up but to no avail. At this point, in addition to the character I'm playing for them and the one they're playing for me, it seems like they want my second character to feel bad about/gush over their A-OC. It's been giving me very \"I want to be the protagonist\" vibes, which is...not what you really want in a roleplay, especially one where the focus is doubling.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has experienced this but please feel free to share if you have! At this point, I think I might just let them know one more time and then quietly drop the RP. It's gotten to the point where I'm not having fun anymore because the plot seems to have turned entirely to their A-OC's trauma and how much everyone adores them rather than something more balanced.",

Green is the cunt in her natural habitat.   \n\n\nSo, story time.   \nI met Green about 16 or so years ago on AoL. I don't think she remembered me, but I sure as shit remembered her. She used to be one of those elitists I wanted *so badly* to fit in with. I don't know what happened to AOL Elitists, but every single one of them that I've come in contract with since the golding and finding Discord has seriously dropped the ball. They would be illiterate \"shit-tiers\" by their own former standards.   \n\n\nAnd Green wasn't much different. She joined my friend's server within days of it launching and made a character in a notoriously underdeveloped city where there weren't any other characters in play. Basically, she set herself up to have no one to write with, right out of the gates. I don't know why she did that.   \n\n\nThere is a grace period in that server where everyone starts out in the central city and only after they get their permanent residence + work assignment are they moved to their long term city. In that time, she could have had her character make friends or network to get her eventual access back to the city. Instead, she derped off in a club, got drunk, watched a few people make out, and then she got moved.   \n\n\nWhen making a character, you can see where the different vocations and economic classes live. She knew well in advance that her character was going to be living in a literal slum. She tried having her character decorate her home and asked for some help on finding the right images. Then she got those images and said \"yeah no offense my character would rather live on the street.\" Okay, no problem, enjoy being the first homeless person on a new planet.   \n\n\nThat by itself wasn't a big deal. But that was just the start. After that, literally every question she asked came with attitude, and instead of a thanks or anything for the help she did get, we got a \"k\" or something equally noncommittal. We tried setting up scenes with our own characters to get her involved, and she just ignored us. Finally she wrote for a bit with another player that was intending to recruit hers into a new job that would have her character getting access to the central city where everyone else was.   \n\n\nMidway through that scene, the above image happened and I am just thrilled that she's gone. My friend who runs the server had been trying to give her all the shots, but I had been telling him for months that not only does she clearly hate the world but she's just plain rude to everyone who tries talking to her. And I could maybe understand being so uppity and rude if her writing was next level but it was barely literate. No spacing, no punctuation. It was a headache to read. I can take a headache from someone nice and cheerful, but Green's personality was ass from the start.   \n\n\n Even the way she left was cunty. Couldn't even lift the fingers it took to leave the server, nope \"just remove me\" and a \"yup\" to the guy that had been bending over backwards to make her cunt-ass happy for months.   \n\n\nI just hope he's learned now why we don't waste our time fostering players with bad attitudes. I'm sure there's a place for writers like that, it's just not anywhere I want to write in.",

            "selftext": "For the context of what I'm about to present you with, I want to start by saying that my RP partner search ad is very detailed about what I can offer and what I'm looking for. Specifically, it details that while I try my best to post once a week, I don't have a set job schedule and things can pop up unexpectedly on occasion. It also details that I do long-term, slow-burn plots which stretch over long periods of time both IC and OOC (meaning, plots that take commitment), that I've been roleplaying for over a decade (again, commitment), and also stresses that, while I'm very conscious about giving my partners enough to work with as well as driving the plot forward, I strongly prefer quality to quantity. I provide several writing samples, some of which are longish (500-700 words), some of which are shorter.\n\nThis person approached me today saying they were interested in writing with a character of mine and sent me their own ad to review. We did seem to be a good match in a lot of areas and I was excited to move forward with them but, in the same breath, their ad also mentioned that they were looking for someone who could post several times a week, and their writing samples were significantly longer than mine. I messaged them about both these issues to clarify, assuming that they had read my ad and were aware of these differences, but wanted to make sure that we were both on the same page and that our expectations were aligned. This is what they sent me in return:\n\n *i did read your ad and i was aware of both those things, but thank you for bringing them up to discuss! while a week is on the longer end for me, it's not outside of my range. and while your posts are on the shorter end for me, they're also not outside of my range. i guess i will leave it to you to determine if those are true and accurate representations of yourself - some people tend to over-inflate their ads in the positive. a week, i can do. consistently waiting 8 days, i cannot do. the lengths you exhibited in your samples (give or take a sentence or two) is fine, half of that length would lose my interest quickly. i try to be flexible and fair - i'm not counting days off on a calendar or running your stuff through a word counter. i just know my limitations and that i'll lose the thread after a week or so of not thinking about it. so! i leave it up to you to decide if consistency is a fair expectation here, and in turn i'm happy to meet you at your speed and length preferences.* \n\nI'm not really looking for advice on this because I've already turned them down. What I wanted this sub's opinion about is: am I wrong to have gotten an offputting vibe from this message? Because, from my end, it sounds like they will *absolutely* be setting a timer waiting for me to respond and will *absolutely* be counting my words (\"give or take a sentence or two\"? *Really?*); plus, their comment about people \"inflating their ads\" really rubbed me the wrong way, generally-speaking as well as specifically, when mine says right there and then that I can't commit to an EXACT week between replies and that I will do my absolute best. \n\nWith that said, I don't necessarily think they're a bad roleplayer, they're definitely entitled to have their boundaries and preferences and I absolutely am not trying to shame them for that - I just got a weird passive aggressive vibe from their message. Am I reading too much into this, or have I dodged a bullet?",

A common opinion, I thought.\nBut then this guy starts about how it would actually be the other persons fault if they didn't mention in the first place that those things trigger them. I mention that I don't really do angsty rp stuff and so whenever it's happened to me, it has been completely out of the blue and a total genre change. Also there are some topics that are triggering to the majority of people that you should absolutely ask about no matter what.\n\nBut he holds his stance that it's the persons fault for not mentioning their trigger, even if the rp had absolutely no dark themes to where it logically shouldn't come up.\nSo I got really pissed off, told him he was victim blaming, and stopped responding. \nI don't even know if this belongs here but it made me mad.

Like, I find a partner, we agree on a scenario and details, I'm excited, then - boom - when it's time to actually RP, I suddenly stop enjoying and come to subconsciously avoid reading and writing posts, no matter how much I was interested in this RP. It's like I cannot even immerse in character/situation and instead write mechanically, delaying replies for days. This also doesn't depend on partner, their skill and writing style; and with good friends it's the same for me if not harder. It's like I'm ashamed or anxious for no real reason.  \n\n\nDid anyone have the same problem or maybe you could suggest anything?\n\nP.S. for context: I only tried text RP a year ago, but I'm decent in writing, plus I had enough friends who RP and read enough guides/stories to be neat at it.

            "selftext": "This might be a dumb rant but I need to get this off my chest. \n\nHarem roleplays are absolutely annoying. I can't stand the fact that a male wants multiple female love interests all catering to him and his needs. And it's mostly one sided and takes a lot of writing.\n\nTheost that you'll get back is like one or two short paragraphs on his end and you're stuck doing the work for multiple characters for that guy. \n\nAnd he lists all these kinks he expects to happen. Most being multiple girls in a sexual scene doing different things while he just sits there and let's it happen. \n\nIt's extremely frustrating. I honestly might be venting evssie I was supposed to do a regular roleplay both someone. We agreed that I could be an OC and he will too. The only time other characters will be played would be for side characters in regular scenes and interactions. \n\nI had told him staright up that I'm not interested in playing multiple love interests for one character at the same time. He said it was fine. \n\nDays passed and I heard nothing from him. I sent a message to see if he's interested. He said sort of and we proceeded toove to discord. \n\nOn discord, he asked for my fandoms of interest and I gave them. Almost immediately he said he was 'horny' for certain fandoms I listed and it would be a plus if he got a harem out of them. \n\nI told him harems aren't my strong suit and would rather not. I don't play multiple nlove interests very well. \n\nHe responds with that was what we was looking for and he didn't care of it wasn't good and he would make it a strong suit for me. \n\nI mentioned on Reddit that we discussed that we didn't need to do a harem as long as I played side characters for the story. I also said that I preferred using an oc as well. \n\nAnd he porceeds to say that he's ok with a OC harem and proceeds to say he wants a harem RP with those two words underlined. \n\nThen he replies to the part where I mentioned on Reddit that we didn't need to do one as discussed and simple says 'sadly opinions change' \n\nI responded simply: 'Well sadly I've lost my interest in Roleplaying with you. \nAs I've said, harems aren't my strong suit and not an interest to me. \nI wish you luck for your search of a harem RP!'\n\nI just hate that he was trio g to push it when I said I wasn't interested in harems.i don't want to heed to his sexual desires through roleplay. I just wanted a story and through reddit he seemed ok with that. It's really frustrating that men think more with their dick than anything. \n\nAnd I hate that female characters have to be overly sexualized for their desire. \n\nNot to mention, he hopped into discord calling me dear and such. I should have taken that as a red flag an bounced bit lately I've been on a hunt for a good story and sadly, this hobby isn't as fun as it used to be with all the horny assholes trying to get off to it in a sexual sense. \n\nI'm probably gonna get some bad responses out of this but I needed to get this off my chest. I hate adding more and more rules of preferences but it looks like I have to add no harems to my roleplay requests.",

Now, I've never required characters to be a certain type, but this time for the plot to work, both had to be elves. I knew I wouldn't get many bites, and that's okay. BUT, the number of people (mostly men) who asked if they could be anything other than an elf was honestly shocking. Why message me about a role that kind of requires your character to be an elf if you don't want to play an elf? They gave lists of species, but none were \"long lived\" or immortal and would take some heavy revision to my lore. I'm just thinking about solo writing this plot now, so save me any more headache.",

I have seen waaaay worse stories here, and this can't compare with them. It has also happened quite a while ago... so it's just more of a storytime thing.\n\nFor context, I was helping moderate this private Amino community that was supposed to be 18+. Yes, it was for horny people and erps, but my task was to keep public stuff as under closed doors as possible. \n*Fun fact*: you can have a *private* community that's okay for mature themes, but imagery is still forbidden, and you still have the risk of minors hopping in and ruin everyone's fun. \n\nBy ruin, I mean risk getting the community reported and closed down. Damn horny kids. I wouldn't care, I was not their mother to smash their smartphone and ground them, but I didn't want the community to close down either. \n\nBut I was also pretty active in the public chat, and writing ideas and character concepts in my posts; that's how this guy knew I was in this specific  fandom. You know, I liked this game. So when he told me specifically he had a character for this game, and wanted to show it to me, I did not mind at all.\n\nI was quite happy; discussing characters and stories, backgrounds, shit like that... plots... I like it. Even if I get to role play or not. You share your ideas and get lots of perspectives to hone them down. All I see is a win. \n\nSo, we move to dms, and he start talking about his character, and I did my best to listen. I mean more often than not, my non-English brain did its best to understand him, you know, all the misspellings and everything. Which I did not mind personally. Everybody makes mistakes. Plus, it was not an actual role-play reply, so it was not like I had to decipher a wall of text. It was okay. \n\nThen, I noticed this mutant character was specifically written to cater for his former role-play group, stuff I wouldn't particularly agree with; for example infinite inventory space, and... you see, this race of people has mutated to the point they became sterile; in his version, this guy of his is *not* sterile, because of a *special strain*, because otherwise where would the *fun* be. If you catch my drift. \n \nYou know, in a group, if everyone agrees to it, you can bend the rules of a fandom however you want. There are AUs and headcanons that can work if everyone shares them. But outside of it? You're *bound* to find people not digging them. \n\nWell, then it became clear that he did not want to just talk about the character, he also wanted to role play, which I politely declined. Okay? It was not my cup of tea. Nothing's bad until now. It happens, I'm not one to get upset over some simple conversations about characters. It was okay. \n\nIt got back when he began to guilt trip me. Or at least try. \n\n- That *nobody liked his character*\n- He wanted to see if I was *flexible enough, he guesses not*\n- That his character was *gathering dust*\n- His group has been gone for years\n\nWhat I did suggest is that he could work on his character, because he has been written *years* ago. And I *was* willing to help. I personally don't believe a character can be considered fully done, if it has not been broken in for at least a few months. I've had my character for this specific fandom since 2018, and I'm still occasionally working on her. Getting her in game, trying out her skills and stats, see what works and what not... writing a character is not easy, and more often than not, I'm not pleased with my final product. So I wouldn't mind.\n\nBut, in his own words, he *did not want to put the effort in writing him, if he didn't know for sure he was going to role play.*\n\nHe was also very adamant to let me know that he disliked if the role play was too *structured*, and that description was a *waste of breath*. He said he was a one-liner, and he wouldn't always put in the effort of writing around two or three lines. \n\nAfter that, I just tried to make him see that describing stuff it's something that *some people enjoy*, and deeming it *useless and a waste of time* was not really a good choice of words, because people have different tastes and styles... and the whole time he complained that our whole conversation was a waste of time because we did not get to role play. Under the conditions that I have not made an ad that I was looking to role play; and I did write about my role-play style in an entry. My profile was not blank, he had plenty of ways to know about how I write. \n\nI did point that out; he kind of got onto the whole *yes, it's my fault, I wasted my time, but it's on me, BUT it's still time wasted*. At some point I just bid him goodbye.\n\nWhat bothered me it was the attitude. And perhaps sheer laziness? Or how later on, he proceeded to kinda publicly shame someone in the group chat for a failed role play attempt, because of lack of communication on *his* part; not even the other guy's. The other guy left because of it. \n\nI was not even angry at this guy, I was just baffled at his attitude. I don't even know what else to say, lol. This happened a good while ago, I don't even know what's happening in that amino, I don't even know if I should mark this as nsfw, because there's only a few brief mentions... let me know if I have to tag it as such.",

            "selftext": "Okay so some of you may remember a post I made a while ago about this cursed rp partner I had. If you haven't seen that post I'll copy paste it here, if you have, the updated story will start under the line break.\n\n\"I just had someone message me about a Star Trek RP ad I put out. By all means everything was pretty normal, just your average discussing what era we're doing, all that. Not really any major red flags or anything. So, the person sends me an Imagur link and says \"This is the ship and the uniforms\" the ship is just a normal Intrepid class ship, it might be the one from DS9 I forget, I'm thinking idk why they need an Imagur link when they already said we're going with DS9 uniforms but whatever. So I scroll down to the uniform image, and it's just straight up porn. Like a graphically sexualized version of the DS9 uniforms that covered pretty much nothing, just full nudity, obviously the drawing was just meant to be porn.\n\nThe person gave me no warning, nothing about NSFW content was even discussed but they just sent that with no context or prior discussion. My ad was very clearly not looking for PWP so I have no idea why they think that's what I would want or why the crew would even be wearing these uniforms but seriously there was no discussion or hint at NSFW before they went \"These are the uniforms they're wearing\" and sent me porn... I did not wait for an explanation I just blocked.\"\n\n\\--\n\nSo every once in a while I like to go back to read comments on posts, and I noticed after I posted that apparently the person that story was about saw that post and was in the comments defending themselves saying \" Your ad didn\u2019t specify no NSFW \" \" I\u2019d be in favour of it becoming a legitimate style, and slowly others begin to be phased out and before long it would be the only one legally allowed. \" and that clothes that cover nothing would be \"direct upgrades\" so clearly they totally missed the point of \"Hey maybe don't send unsolicited porn to someone with no warning?\" Also their justifications that those uniforms would be 'upgrades' is objectively absurd because what's the point of wearing uniforms that cover nothing, that's incredibly impractical. Also, forgot to point out in the original ad, the only figures drawn and sexualized in the photo are women... because of course. And yeah, my ad didn't specify no NSFW.... because I'm fine with NSFW but obviously there's a difference between \"NSFW is fine with buildup\" and \"this is porn without plot\"\n\nAnyway, cut to 4 months later, I get a friend request from someone. I accept, it's an account I haven't spoken to before, I figure they're messaging me about an rp ad I posted on Live Journal a few weeks ago... nope, they're responding to the Star Trek ad I posted on LJ 4 months ago... so I make a comment asking how they even found an ad I posted 4 months ago, there's no answer. They say \"But anyways I\u2019ve been itching to do something in the far future, I\u2019ve got something here with my character in it as well\" and send me an Imagur link. Place your bets now as to what you think was in that imagur link. If you guessed 'Porn' you'd be correct! The same exact porn from the same exact person. My ad specifies that I don't write with men but if I had to take a wild guess I'm assuming this is a man that didn't listen because he has all the same red flags I've dealt with back when I wrote with men. So he got a new account.... and either forgot I was the same person, or hoped that getting a new account would mean I would just forget about him? And Clearly he didn't learn his lesson about sending unsolicited porn to strangers because he did the same shit again!\n\nAnother commenter also pointed out that by commenting on the original post he was circumventing my block and not respecting that I blocked him so clearly he has no respect for that.... I'm genuinely in shock lmao what the fuck is wrong with people. and to the guy this post is about, if you're reading this, fuck you and the horse you rode in on lmao.\n\nALSO since he sent me the same cursed porn again now I have screenshots of that link so if any of you want to see how bad it actually is, DM me and I'll send the picture to you.",

RP partner does not show up. A few hours later they tell me that they forgot and took a nap. Ouch lol. They also do other things like drawing other ships but not ours. And ofc, just not responding to our 1x1s. \n\nI asked if they were going to come tomorrow bc we didn't finish today. They said they had other things to do. They are one of my best friends however and I don't want RP to get in the way of it. Plus it's not like I can blame them for having irl plans over an RP (and tbh, these quests can take up a lot of time).

Basically it was a plot about a cop trying to help out a repeat drug offender. I was put off by him wanting me to use his character but I liked the idea so after making sure we matched rp styles we started. \n\nAlmost a few messages in he tells me that I'm not playing his character correctly and makes me redo multiple scenes. Eventually I got fed up with the constant interruptions in the story and him controlling the character I was playing so I asked him to stop. He didn't and after I told him I didn't think I wanted to continue I left the chat and he reported and burated me over chat.\n\nTL;DR I start an interesting rp that goes airy when he tries to control the character.",

(Granted, how dry they were and how little they wanted to discuss before the rp started was a red flag I ignored.)\nIn my add I was very specific and said that I roleplayed literately, and could do semi-literate as well, but that also meant multiple lines. They said ok, and when I asked if they could start us off they said yes. They started us off by saying *lurking.*\nIn my head I was confused, but then thought that they possibly just wanted ME to start. I shrugged and typed a small paragraph, not knowing how literate they were. They did NOT rp in third person (I pointed that out and they still used \u201cI\u201d language). Used asterisks, and above all are only giving me a few lines to work with! Now, I get not being as literate, maybe you\u2019re a beginner, but if a person clearly says \u201cliterate or semi literate\u201d then shouldn\u2019t you not reply if you can\u2019t deliver?\nAm I in the wrong for thinking this way? \nIf they were a new roleplayer and wanted help to make their skills better I would no doubt be willing to help and give pointers! But they seemed to be able to do multiple lines and rolelay at least semi literately. I voiced my concern and am awaiting a response.",

But then I found someone in my home country and it\u2019s been great almost 4 months in love it and we have good level of chat ooc, I think we have clocked over 600 hours on discord. Is that normal and have you found urself falling for someone in a rp and has that became something like a friendship. Also I\u2019m concerned that we can\u2019t rp the same hours soon maybe less than half of what we usually do and I\u2019m worried she may loose intrest and move on but it doesn\u2019t look like she bored yet.

            "selftext": "Im gonna preface this by mentioning I have a \\*lot\\* going on in my personal life that may be affecting the way I am handling this situation. This year already has been very rough on me with familial losses and mental health issues so I beg if you're gonna rip me a probably well deserved new one, you're at least kind. This is going to be long, this is going to be messy, and I really don't think I'm going to sound like a good person here, or at least not a stable one. \n\nI am distressed constantly with my writing partner of two years. I constantly feel like she is ignoring me or growing distant. We've become so close - I know her, her husband, we play video games online regularly and voice chat and I know them on a personal note. Full names, we've even swapped presents before. I really consider them both IRL friends but at the beginning of the year we had some arguments about stuff outside of our games and things don't feel like they've ever really recovered. She's very sensitive and nonconfrontational and I am very hot headed and can be a bit of a bull dozer when I get heated, something I've tried to work with to gain control of and have apologized for. We kinda made up? It never felt like things really healed from that break down of friendship and now it just feels like it's getting worse. \n\nI'm aware I have some attachment issues, I get pretty paranoid if even the slightest change to a relationship happens. I've tried practicing the skills I've learned over the years in therapy and such - if it's not important enough for her to bring up then it probably isn't that big of a deal, if something is wrong let the other person address it first, just because someone is busy it doesn't mean they don't want to talk to you. \n\nThe funny thing is - I don't get like this with every partner I write with. I can be ghosted and really not give a shit but I feel like I went too far and now I think of her like a real friend which has triggered some of my interpersonal relationship issues. I really want to distance myself, but I don't know how. I don't have many IRL friends because I'm pretty introverted and it's just easier to find friends online. I've tried even finding new people to write with, thinking if I had more people to spread my time across I would be less hyper focused on her but it's like no one else keeps the urge to write anymore... but if I'm being honest the stress has taken all of my joy from writing out of any of the games I'm in right now.  The idea of leaving the games, which we have many of, makes me physically ill to think about because of how much time and effort has gone into crafting these worlds and also... what am I gonna do with my time? I work nights, there isn't a lot for me to do when I am awake and when I do get time off I don't usually have much of a social life to think of since the pandemic hit (hospital worker so I'm basically always possibly a walking vector so I try to limit my exposure with people).\n\nI've tried putting distance between her and I before but I always end up running across things that make me think of our characters or our games and I break down and send them to her. The main thing that's gotten under my skin is the constant feeling like \\*I\\* am always the one to send things... I know it's unreasonable, I have much more time since my job isn't always super busy and I have time to scroll on my phone. It feels like I'm always the one to come up with new ideas for her characters and mine, finding them pictures for their outfits, creating music lists for them. I can't tell you the last time SHE proposed an idea for MY character that didn't involve hers getting some kind of massive character arch in the same breath, but I am always coming up with ideas and plot points that give her characters personal growth even if they don't involve mine. Or I'll juggle ALL of our NPC's, which sometimes can be close to two dozen over the span of some of our stories. I feel like I put all this effort into our games cause I love the ability to take her through these stories she says she loves but I feel like I never get a break - I never get the chance to sit back and let her pick or come up with ideas. The last idea she came up with I had to tell her multiple times completely invalidated the point of my character because she wanted to take his curse (a curse that was his entire character arch mind you) and basically borrow it for her own character without any of the drawbacks... She brought it up multiple times and even proposed it as a dream sequence so it had no real in game effect.\n\nI never feel like I'm reciprocated her time or attention and I tried to bring up that it'd be nice if she sent me a meme or a picture or something once in a while and she gave a generic \"thank you for being comfortable enough to tell me how you feel\" before moving on ... she used to. She used to be super active with this stuff... then that damn fight. It's not even like she just isn't that type of writing partner, she used to do it all the time. \n\nI've gotten so worried about what I'm going to do out of a rush of anger that I transferred all our servers over to her to keep myself from impulsively deleting them. Part of me wants to leave everything, block her, and just give up on the hobby as a whole, but I keep holding out hope that things will eventually feel right again. She is going through a pretty big life change at the moment and I'm trying to tell myself it's just that, but Idk anymore. i find myself being angry with her all the time, even when I know she doesn't deserve it and I'm constantly having to step away and close the app just to bring myself back to reality. I feel like I can feel her drifting away from me and I can't bring myself to rip the bandage off and just leave before she does. I feel like if I even tried to talk to her about it she'd either go into people pleaser mode, leave, or withdraw even more and I'm fucking paralyzed by that idea. \n\nI'll probably delete this after not too long. I probably shouldn't be roleplaying with anyone if I can't set my own boundaries and get myself feeling like this. I've tried other hobbies, even picked up video games.. nothing scratches the same itch and this is one of the few hobbies I find that really makes me feel okay",

            "selftext": "I've had an rp partner for like 4 1/2 years. We've rped over 3 rp boards to rping over email, and rping over Discord. A month ago today, I told my partner that we should make an rp schedule and he agreed. We each have our own separate rps where in mine, I decide what the plot is and the main things I want to happen in it. I choose the fandom and the characters and couples we play, and he does the same for his.\n\nAnyway, we made a schedule and we're both having problems with it. We both rp fandoms.\n\nFor example, my partner wants to RP a certain fandom. He has it set up to rp this fandom on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. And the truth is, I hate the fandom he wants to rp those days, but I go along with it because they're his rp's and his choice. I haven't told him that every time we rp that fandom I hate it more and more.\n\nAnyway, back to the main issue. We have a schedule set up like this:\n\nMonday: Something Else  \nTuesday:  His Fandom  \nWednesday: No rping  \nThursday: His Fandom  \nFriday: Something Else  \nSaturday: His Fandom  \nSunday: Something Else  \n\n\nNow, ever since I asked for and made the schedule on Feb 2nd, he's been giving me shit about Wednesdays. The last 5 Wednesdays, including today, he's been giving me shit when I log in. He keeps asking me for replies and I say, \"It's Wednesday\", and he says, \"Yes, it is.\" I don't reply to that and then he says, \"So, it's an off day. No replies?\" Once again, I haven't responded, but it's pissing me off that he keeps doing this.\n\nI need a break from the 3 fandoms he's been obsessed with lately, and I'm so close to telling him off for how pissy he acts every Wednesday when I tell him that I don't want to rp, as it's my considered 'away day' from rping. \n\nThe thing is, he's the longest rp partner I've ever had and we have so many fandoms in common, that I've been afraid of telling him about my issues with him. I don't have any other rp partners and it's so hard to find rp partners that don't do one-liners, aren't obsessed with sex rp's, and who actually like the fandoms I like.",

            "selftext": "Ok, so I'm sure many of you have heard stories about how many male rpers have been turned down by female rpers with regards to doing FxF pairings. Personally, I don't blame said females for saying no because they feel more comfortable doing such a pairing with another female - that's completely understandable. And I also don't blame males for requesting to do a FxF pairing with a female rper because they're interested in trying something new or it's something they've been craving for a while.\n\nIn my case, I've only ever had one female be ok with allowing me to do a FxF rp - and it flopped, but it was mainly because of the difference in literacy and response length. I've been advertising in multiple rp subreddits with ideas for FxF pairings, but I get no results. And when I find posts from other rps with the F4A tag, I offer to rp and I also add the possibility of FxF in my introductory message in PM and Chats. No dice there, either.\n\nI'm not ticked off or anything like that, but I'm disappointed because I see lots of posts where females offer to play as male characters and they most likely get responses - yet when a male puts up a post where they offer to play as female characters, nothing seems to happen (or maybe something does happen, I could be wrong). \n\nNow just to clarify, I'm not someone who always does pure smut all the time. I'm an experienced rper in my 20s and I'm someone who enjoys long-term rps with storybuilding and character development along with many elements tying into the story (action, drama, romance, etc.). I'm totally cool with MxF pairings and I've had a bunch of really awesome experiences with this type of pairing, but I've been wanting to do FxF pairings for quite a while now and it just feels impossible to find a partner who's ok with having a male playing a female. To me, I feel like the only way I'd be able to accomplish this is by making an alt and pretending to be something I'm not - which is something I frown upon and absolutely do not want to do\n\nOverall, where am I going wrong and what should I do?",

            "selftext": "the posts on here as of recently have seriously prompted me to have a proper sit down with myself regarding continuation of this hobby, and granted it's been a long time coming given the state of the rpc. \n\nhobbies are meant to be fulfilling, fun, creativity-inducing, and relaxing. as of lately, i've been feeling none of this when approaching roleplaying, and the endless search for solid longterm partners has definitely not helped. in fact, i'd venture to say it's done quite the opposite, and i know i am not the only one here. \n\ni seriously wonder what happened to the community in general and why things have become the way  that they have. like i genuinely wish someone would conduct a study on this topic or something so we can receive some clearcut answers. \n\ni have been attempting to find a new longterm partner since november/december of 2019 and for the most part, i've only encountered the following: \n\n* people who are disrespectful of your time/efforts. this goes both ways, from individuals who ping you for responses if you're gone from your keyboard for even a couple of hours, or people who fade into the void only to come back weeks or even months later as if nothing happened, expecting everything to be kosher. people also acting incredibly defensive when you point either of these things out. \n* people who have no ideas/character development/plot development/*literally anything* to bring to the table. people who hit you up talking about \"hey wanna rp\" but have absolutely no content they wish to see, meaning that you'll of course be charged with carrying the story and even *their character's development.* \n* people who only care about faceclaims/living in escapist realities featuring their celebrity crushes and wanting you to provide that for them. this is more of an issue on tumblr, but it speaks for itself. time and time again people have stopped responding to me as soon as i reveal my face claim(s) (i choose more unconventional/underused face claims), despite everything going well before we got to the topic of faceclaims. god forbid someone doesn't play sebastian stan or jeffrey dean morgan for some of these people in every single plot. \n* people who don't understand the concept of slowburn and therefore wish to barrel through the entire plot before we've even gotten our bearings. \n* people who don't understand the concept of respecting boundaries ooc. \n\nthere are probably a myriad of issues that my bullet points did not cover, but these are just the ones that came to mind first as to why i am completely exhausted/burned out on the concept of finding new partners. it's a huge bummer because i adore writing and being able to bounce ideas off of someone else, when that person is a good match. writing with someone else just allows for creativity to manifest in a different way because your partner may bring ideas to the table that you haven't considered before, but at this point i feel like i'd be more productive writing solo or focusing on other hobbies that i'm otherwise neglecting in my search for writing partners. i think if i don't find any solid matches by the end of this year, i have to hang up my hat for good.",

She says \u201c she looks similar to my super toxic irl cousin. I just realized. \u201c so I\u2019m floored. I\u2019m not sure what to do so I just calmly say \u201c well we can cancel this rp. And work on our others. \u201c she goes \u201c well can\u2019t you just change her FC? \u201c now mind you I have been writing this rp for 2 years. That\u2019s 2 years of development I\u2019ve had and now I\u2019m attached to the way she looks. But I try to be a good sport and say \u201c well I can\u2026but will you change your OC\u2019s FC too? So it\u2019s fair? \u201c she goes OFF. Saying I\u2019m selfish, and I\u2019m not the one the with the problem so why does she have to change? Saying I don\u2019t care I just wanna get even. All this stuff and I was so damn surprised I haven\u2019t answered back yet. AMIA here?\n\nPS. The FC I\u2019m using is a celebrity so before anyone asks.

We met in February of 2020, and we\u2019ve been together ever since.\n\nProblem is, I think that we\u2019ve reached the breaking point. It happened after this summer when we both worked thankless jobs with long hours and we didn\u2019t really talk at all for literal months. We said we\u2019d take time to get back into it when we had more free time, and now that it\u2019s happened\u2026 it hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nAnd I\u2019m worried it\u2019s me, honestly.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but nothing we do excites me anymore. Previous stories I wanted to do with her don\u2019t seem to do it and I feel like she only wants to really do one type of story, while I\u2019m more broad. I like fantasy and science fiction and other genres, she just sticks with modern settings. The fandoms we\u2019ve tried went nowhere and I don\u2019t know what to tell her.\n\nDoes anybody have some advice for what I can do? I don\u2019t want to just up and drop her, that\u2019s not what you do to a 2-year partner, but there are some glaring problems that need to be addressed badly.",

            "selftext": "((TW: I like ERP and am vivid with my vocabulary. Skip if you don't vibe with that. Totally cool if you do. I am proud you know yourself like that. ))\n\n  \n\n\nThis is a vent I know many of you can relate to. Hell, browsing this sub by best of all time was therapeutic because of the sheer amount of \"men are insufferable in this hobby\" posts. It was a great relief since I always worried that I was painting with too broad of a brush. As if I just had inexplicably bad luck wave after wave of idiot men that initiated RP with me. \n\n  \n\n\nIts always the same set of stories. They cross boundaries in OOC. They try to sneak in their wishes regardless of your ad or limits. Their only experience with adult themes is with pornographic material. This last point I don't even entertain past the first couple of posts because descriptions are downright comedic. Suspense of belief simply gone. My dude, you don't need to spit in a coochie. It lubricates itself if you had a single clue on what you're doing. All you did was give her a yeast infection.\n\n  \n\n\nThe fancy strikes me to play a female character every few months. I go out for a search, find myself bombarded by store-brand misogyny or inconceivable ignorance left and right, and wind up choosing a girl's post to play her preferred male of whatever Fandom I share with her. \n\n  \n\n\nI don't hate it. If I did I wouldn't do it. I meet so many creative, giddy girls ready to share their art and dessert recipes in OOC and then become absolutely cock-hungry monsters in IC. The juxtaposition of a channel filled with hell-guaranteeing prose next to one filled with corgi gifs always lights up my day. And besides, I absolutely adore playing irredeemable bastards. Everyone wins. \n\n  \n\n\nBut it does make me sad that my female OCs are relegated to being supporting cast to so many other storylines. Sometimes I wish they had their day. I've even gone as far as trying to find someone to double with... but its just not the same as being the protagonist. It always feels like a pity response compared to their own preference.\n\n  \n\n\nI've made my peace with it. I came back to search for a guy and found myself another amazing female OC to knock up instead. (Refer to my irredeemable bastard comment) This time I get to play a male canon character I've been wanting to try for awhile and never got the chance! We've already swapped a good number of replies in a few days too.\n\n  \n\n\nDamn, though. It tickles me pink that girls are serving themselves up on bound-and-gagged platters, chronically horny, and somehow a staggering amount of guys cockblock themselves simply from an inability to not be fucking disgusting. Tie your hog and you'll be hog-tying her soon enough. Every great composition has a prelude. A crescendo without it is just INSUFFERABLE NOISE not unlike your barrage of overtly sexual messages sent that no penis is every worthy of. \n\n  \n\n\nLike, some of these dudes describe their penises in great detail while railing my chick, giving her nothing but a line or two in their love-letter to themselves. I half expect Rod Sterling to finish a closing statement on whatever fucking Twilight Zone THAT is. \n\n  \n\n\nHonorable not-all-men mention to one absolute treasure of a dude who I met and have RP'd longterm with. As luck would have it, however, he only plays females! Lmfao.\n\n  \n\n\n((BTW, you guys here are so nice so I'm going to go ahead and say I need no saving. Extend the offer to an MxF enjoyer in need. I really am happy with the storylines I've got now! \u2661))",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been having the itch to roleplay, specifically I\u2019ve been trying to do oc x oc because after a particularly heinous experience in an ERP server, I wanted more substance. So, I went to a site I\u2019m on that\u2019s main point is storing characters and decided to try my luck there. Y\u2019all know how the search goes, post to the forum and wait a bit, maybe bump the thread every once in a while.\n\nSo around last night I received a dm from somebody and already they\u2019re kinda setting off some alarm bells but most of it is kinda because they\u2019re unprepared a little bit (that\u2019s not the problem here, it was moreso confusion on how the site worked it seems). However what really struck me is they don\u2019t have any characters and are offering to make one on the spot for the roleplay.\n\nNow there\u2019s no?? Inherent problems to me about this. I don\u2019t consider it a huge red flag that should be avoided at every turn and I\u2019m willing to hear anybody out as my rp rules are kind of relaxed compared to most, but it\u2019s got me wondering something. If you make characters on the spot for roleplay, especially when approaching someone with a pre-made character (OC if you will), why? \n\nIn my perspective I have had this oc for a good number of years and have developed them throughout those years, constantly changing things, writing and rewriting aspects to their character until I have them exactly as they are today. It doesn\u2019t necessarily come off as lazy when my partner makes a character on the spot since I know how quickly character concepts can form but I don\u2019t see how you can have good/well thought out/in depth character interactions between a character who has been worked on by the creator for weeks/months/years and a character that was made only 3 seconds ago (possibly with the help of the other partner) and that you\u2019re probably only going to toss away once you\u2019re finished with the RP anyway.\n\nI guess my question is if you\u2019re only going to make a character then and there for a roleplay, what are you looking to get out of it then? I\u2019ve done it before and although it was fine and it worked for what it was, I found that the connection/character development just doesn\u2019t run as deep as it does whenever I use one of my actual OC\u2019s.",
