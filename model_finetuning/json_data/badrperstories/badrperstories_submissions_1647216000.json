            "selftext": "So, I've started telling my [Tales](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/quhsui/tales_from_tumblr_swtor_rp_1/) already, but today's Tale comes from Black Desert Online. This tale brought to you by: 1) [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/tfe8d8/is_it_only_my_impression_or_are_some_roleplaying/) and 2) Several topics coming up about polyamory, both IRL and on Reddit.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, BDO is a Korean MMORPG. After several years of pure grind, I found myself more interested in the idea of getting back into RP than more grinding. So, I migrated to the RP server. Fast forward a bit, and I was in a position of looking for an RP guild to join. This is one of many tales from that guild. We shall called the guild hmm... the Marauders. And their GM, MaraudBitch. \n\nFor the record, I made many mistakes while in this guild. There were like, a parade of Red Flags flying around, but I just sorta thought I was being judgmental or paranoid when I noticed them. Ha, no. \n\nLet's start with Day 1 of joining their guild Discord server, after joining their guild. MaraudBitch described the guild as \"like family to her.\" And, like its counterpart in job interviews, that's a warning sign. I *really* should have paid attention to that. Within moments of joining, some rando PMed me. We'll call her Liz. Liz described herself as \"mother's problem child\" and assured me that \"If anyone gives you a problem let me know! I will beat them up.\" Looking back, that's a [missing stair](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Missing_stair) warning, but hindsight is 20/20. (Like I said, communist parade up in here.) \n\nA little about Liz. Liz is one personality of a DID person. Liz is a trans-woman. She disowned her own family, and via RPing with MaraudBitch, as her daughter, came to think of herself as her IRL daughter. Adopted, so to speak. MaraudBitch encourages this. (Like I said, some colorguard flag-waving up in here.)\n\nMaraudBitch opened up about herself on the Discord. Turns out, she's a \"recovering\" borderline personality disordered person. Note the quotes. \"Recovering.\" Self-described empath, and very proud of it. Married, in an open relationship with her husband. I eventually discovered, one of her highest ranking guild officers (let's name him Sylvester) was also in a relationship with her. And, Syl's ALSO in an open relationship with his wife. And Syl was planning on moving cross-country to live in MaraudBitch's house. One big happy family, no?\n\nSo this is all background to the main plot of today's Tale. (Is the popcorn done popping yet? Go get it!) \n\nOk so, worth mentioning, in BDO there's a mechanism to declare war on other guilds. This is mainly used for territory disputes (a la \"Quit KSing my mobs!\"). Here and there, an RP guild will declare war on another RP guild for plot reasons, because RP. It's rare though, and usually staged well in advance. \n\nSo imagine my surprise when Marauders Discord was talking about a declaration war on some dinky guild I'd never heard of. Dafuq? So naturally, I ask what's going on. (With my witch's quarterstaff sharpened and ready to go fend off a territory dispute.) Oh, boy.\n\nRewind 3 years earlier. So MaraudBitch was in a much larger, more popular guild, let's call them WheelHouse. WheelHouse was known for its big, weekly RP parties that they publicly host in major cities. WheelHouse had an officer, Kevin. Kevin was a notorious ERP playboy. So MaraudBitch and Kevin were talking together about arranging an ERP between their characters. \n\nAccording to MaraudBitch, Kevin was insisting on sexually harassing her character, Emma. Emma was \"child-like\" and \"innocent\" and \"pure of heart,\" but definitely an adult, ok? (Totally.) IIRC, Emma was a shai, a race of fae similar to gnomes. (For [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u64XCHPvgmM&amp;ab_channel=EvianSinkarion).) She told him no repeatedly, so he retaliated by spreading rumors about her in the guild. Ultimately, she was kicked from the guild as a result of those rumors. Apparently, sometime later, he met his girlfriend via in-game ERP. \n\nFast-forward a bit. Because I was dubious, I investigated these claims. According to Kevin, and other members of the guild, that's not what happened. Kevin claims she came onto him. He found the character too child-like for his taste, and declined her advances. From many eye-witness accounts, she showed up at a public WheelHouse event, quite upset. Kevin and his girlfriend were in attendance, and upon seeing them together, she blew up at them both. Very obviously jealous. She got booted for causing drama.\n\nBut let's return to the declaration of war. Turns out, Kevin had a dispute with WheelHouse leadership over the direction of the RP plot, so he broke off with his GF and a small handful to create his own RP guild. Literally, the moment MaraudBitch caught wind, she wanted to declare war on his new guild. See, WheelHouse was too big to declare war on, so she waited until Kevin was vulnerable. MB had been planning this, apparently. She had a \"sister guild,\" run by her best friend, that was building up their characters for war-like purposes. The sister guild declared war, at MB's direction. Marauders were being tasked with keeping tabs on the movements of new guild, so whenever they emerge from safe zones, they can be ganged up on by the other guild, who we were coordinating with. Liz and I were tasked with attending WheelHouse events, pretending to be there for RP, but actually notifying the sister guild when they left the party. A task that Liz threw herself whole-heartedly into, gleefully \"protecting Mother.\" Meanwhile, publicly, Marauders deny all knowledge of any involvement.\n\nLike I said, it seemed dubious, so I held my tongue and started looking into this nonsense. Didn't help that they all referred to Kevin's GF as The Whore or The Slut or The Bitch. That was a good clue that something was *very* wrong. \n\nLong story short, I managed to pull both GMs into a chat with me, and convinced them to stand down and quit this nonsense. I forget how, I have deleted those receipts. IIRC, the most convincing argument was that no one's fooled about this ruse, and MB already has a reputation in the RP community, and if she wanted to increase recruitment and activity, she'd have to show good faith to the community. I think I threatened to leave, also, as this was drama I wanted no part of. (**I REALLY SHOULD HAVE**.) I think she knew that once I was gone, nothing stops me from telling the story.\n\nSo here I am, telling the story.  I hope you enjoyed this Tale.",

            "selftext": "I've been running into this a LOT lately, and I'm sure many of you have had the same issue.\n\nI posted up LF RP thread with a bunch of different ideas, character roles, and so on. I like to be detailed but also vague enough where there's plenty of wriggle room for my partner and I to create our own characters and a unique plot with the framework.\n\nWithout fail, I always get 1-3 people who message me that they're interested and then provide little to nothing to the actual creative process. I don't usually mind playing GM or progressing the plot, but I also usually prefer there to actually be...*some* sort of collaboration involved?\n\nTo give an example, let's say I posted about a plot where we'd be playing multiple characters and there are many different directions it could go. I'll always have a few people who DM me eagerly asking if they could play \\[specific occupations/character tropes\\] and if I could play \\[other occupations/character tropes\\], and then we come up with the story together. I like these DMs! But in the cases I'm venting about, however, it goes more like...  \n\n\n&gt;Them: Hi, I'm interested in your \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ plot.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Hi, thanks for contacting me! Did you have any specific direction you wanted to take that plot?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: No, whatever's fine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Oh, okay! I can offer you some specifics I had in mind. Did you already have a character in mind for this plot?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Yes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Great! Do you have a character sheet or even just a brief description for them?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: No.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Oh. Could you let me know a little about them at least? And what kind of character did you want me to play against them?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: \\[The answer varies here. Sometimes I get a single word answer like \"detective\", other times it's \"whoever\"\\].  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I think I can probably write one up if you give me a bit. I'd also like to play \\[character role\\]. Do you think you'd be okay with \\[different character role\\] as your secondary character?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Okay.\n\nSometimes it goes on from there. Most of the time, I just get tired from the one-sidedness of it all and back out of the conversation before we can even start writing. I just hate how they never offer me any info unless I ask for it because it feels like such a drag to ask them for it. I almost feel like I'm the one who DMed them and not the other way around!\n\nHas anyone else had this experience, and what do you tend to do? Have you pushed on through and found that it was worth all the effort of you playing 20 questions in the beginning, did you push through and find it *wasn't* worth it, or do you just nip it in the bud?",

            "selftext": "Remember when roleplay used to be fun? And by fun, I meant a lot of people would read, engage, and there were (and probably still are!) tonnes of talented writers out there to engage with? I think each time I posted a M4F prompt on various places like here, whisper and a few others, I\u2019d often get a few picks of the bunch and it would lead to a great night flexing my literary muscles!\n\nOver the years, my patience has diminished when finding partners, and not via me just being shorter or brutal with people; quite the opposite.\n\n\nBut when I put up a lengthy prompt (such as my post history) which outlines a specific idea, NSFW or not, which includes in bold or differing colour text that I am NOT looking for other ideas at the present time, there will always be a bunch of people who will come regardless and try their luck.\n\nI used to just politely decline, back when I was a teenager (oh how that was a decade ago now!), and be done with it, but with how obnoxiously people do it now, I\u2019ve taken a fair hostile approach to these blatent script trashers \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nExample: I post a prompt with a strong mafia storyline. It loosely outlines a timeline, a couple of characters, and the sorts of acts expected (crime, weapons, sexual undertones here and there etc). Posts in bold letters not looking for other ideas at present.\n\nGUARANTEE I will always get 2-4 partners who will act interested, ask no questions about it, then try and stuff in this fluffy storyline about them being in high school loving a mafia boss or something, and after all these years, I now instead of declining, I call it out, along the lines of:\n\n\u201cSo, guessing you didn\u2019t read the first line of my post then?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so you ignored my post and just want your own story then, cool.\u201d\n\u201cCould you just copy and paste me the second and third lines back to me?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure how mafia, high school and \u2018not looking for other themes\u2019 are related but y\u2019know.\u2019\n\n\nPassive aggressive? Yes.\nThen they\u2019ll always act like I\u2019m being a total d&amp;\u00a3khead about it.\nYes, to an extent I am, but when you literally refuse to read my requirements, think it\u2019s okay to ram your stuff into my own prompts, derail it, don\u2019t be surprised when you get a bit of aggro back. It\u2019s just as \u2018d\u00a3&amp;kheaded\u2019 to refuse to respect my post.\n\nI\u2019m not worried about the effects of not having as many people to play with, because if they don\u2019t respect my boundaries (demanding kinks I don\u2019t engage with, ignoring and derailing my stuff despite warnings) then they\u2019re not a partner I want either now, or any time in the future.",

With a kink list... In your first message to me? I'm blocking you. It just feels so rude when I allude to nothing sexual in any of my search threads. I LIKE to write smut, but it feels like walking into a room with a complete stranger and telling them you really like to be pegged - before even saying your name. Like would you start a conversation in person like this? God dayum. Buy me fucking dinner first. Like put your dick away, dry out your coochie, maybe let me get past the FIRST MESSAGE. (also if you just throw random info at me as well: \"21+ GM High fantasy plots.\" I am not responding to you. I physically cannot fathom where to begin at the list of stats about yourself and then your discord handle and nothing else, I'm from the south! I need SOME pleasantries!)\n\n2) why have the smut writers taken over all of the alternative roleplay subreddit? Like some of them are just lists of kinks in the title and it's like you guys have SO MANY places to find partners, leave us like 1 functional subreddit that you haven't completely taken over that isn't one of the two major ones (the unspeakable sub that allows no mention of anything past a pg rating and the partner search one). Like there are so many ERP subreddits, leave us like three!\n\n3) just because I say I like dark themes in my search thread does not mean I want you to send me a writing sample about the disembowlment of a TEN YEAR OLD at a raided sex trafficking ring! Oh my fucking God you fucking weirdo. You absolute creep. This wasn't even a excerpt from a game this was something new he came up with for me! He didn't even ask! Like ya dark themes like gore and drug abuse and horrible life things can be fun but it's a discussion before hand! You don't just start a conversation like that without warning! Like holy shit. Maybe I don't want to read about a child in a sex trafficking ring shiver and cry in the corner? Maybe I have a hard limit when it comes to kids? Oh wait, you wouldn't know! You just threw that out there! And it wasn't even like that good or descriptive! Aaahh! And obviously I'm fucking dumbfounded because holy shit I just wanted to make sure our writings mesh I didn't expect to be given abused children? So I just step away and go do something else and not even a full day passes and I get \"yo?\" like MY GUY you just gave me disembowled children! Unprompted!",

Planning went smoothly, and we got most things sorted out quickly. Well, time came for the rp to actually get started. I made the first post and then nothing. It's been a little over 2 weeks, and I've heard nothing from them. If there was any communication, I wouldn't mind waiting, but there's not. At this point, I've moved on and don't even want to do the plot anymore as I've had time to think of another one. AITA if I just end the rp before it's really even started? Like I understand life happens, but also if you don't have time to roleplay, just say that. Should I wait a bit longer? I've sent out a friendly bump at the 2 week mark, but it seems like they are ignoring it.",

Those are both fine, but you have to be ready for extreme reactions if you\u2019re going to RP extreme scenarios.\n\nAnyways, psycho murderer demon casually walks out of the shadows literally eating a human arm. Too Cool for School sees this and goes \u201cTsk, whatevs. To each their own.\u201d\n\nMy character freaks the hell out\u2026and after some back and forth both of the other characters start to ridicule mine for such an extreme reaction. Both saying stuff \u201cIt\u2019s just an arm, idiot, what are you, a pussy?\u201d\n\nAgain\u2026I\u2019m perfectly fine if that\u2019s how you want to play the game. My character though freaks out and runs away. Like completely. I remove myself from the game\u2026because that\u2019s how I think he would react to an arm eating demon trying to engage in casual conversation. I think that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable response. You know, if I was playing a knight or something I probably would have immediately attacked psycho murderer too. Also a realistic response.\n\nMy problem comes when OOC both players start giving me shit for leaving. Like\u2026what the hell did you expect to happen? I was just going to sit there and carry on a perfectly normal conversation while your guy is EATING AN ARM? Maybe, you know, tone down the craziness if you don\u2019t want people to run away from you or try to attack you.\n\nAlso, Too Cool for School, guy\u2026I get it, everyone\u2019s a wimp compared to your super emotionless bad ass\u2026but damn, dude, don\u2019t be coming after me OOC just because I decide to RP a slightly more realistic reaction. Maybe your character is cool with the arm eating, but mine isn\u2019t.\n\nLike, seriously, these two wanted to sit there and talk backstory while crazy guy ate a freaking arm. That\u2019s just not what my character is into.",

Basically, we will be in a group together for example, two players who are plotting a romantic line would be roleplaying, and OOCly she would DM one of the roleplayers in question and say something along the lines of \"Hey! You should have your character get with mine instead! They'd be so much more compatible!\" \n\nThis typically happens with male characters, as she mostly plays female characters. I can play any kind of character, but I do have a tendency to make male characters, so she's done this to me too, ICly and OOCly. Like one time, I was in a group scene with people, and my male character was interacting with his love interest. And her character comes in and starts to try to flirt him -and- DMs me later. \n\nI'm all for IC conflict, but this person is just straight up messy. It isn't just romantic lines either. One time I was in a plotting group chat with her and a few other people, and me and another friend were plotting to play siblings, and she told my friend \"Be my sibling instead!\". It's gotten really annoying. I've called her out on it a few times, but whenever I give her constructive criticism on something, she gets very defensive and doesn't want to listen. \n\nShe's gotten defensive when people have called out other issues of hers too, but that's a whole other post entirely. Anyways, have you encountered a person like this? I'm curious.",

            "selftext": "I've had bad partners before, at least two but I've never posted here before as I don't like trashing people. But now after lurking here for a while, I just had an encounter that left me speechless. \n\nContacted a guy in DMs, saying that I was interested in an rp, he sent me a chat and we chatted briefly before i asked if we could go back to DMs. That's where the friction began. He asked why chat was inconvenient and I gave him a list of reasons. Then got a DM from the guy, answered it and then he made a whole new DM channel to respond. Turns out he didn't see the reply button. \n\nWhatever, small mistake. \n\nHe then asked \"How are your punctuation and grammar?\" This just did not seem right upon saying it aloud. I thought there should be an 'is' instead of an 'are'. Perhaps I am wrong and other places do it differently but as a brit, it did not seem right. \"I responded with a \"Safe to say together than yours\" perhaps a little rude, most definitely snarky but not intended as an insult, I just thought the situation was funny and I suppose that didn't quite translate well over text...We then argued over whether it should be 'is' or 'are'. I thought it should be 'is' as both 'grammar' and 'punctuation' were singular. He gave an example, I gave an example of \"How is your dog?\" VS \"How are your dog?\" and then \"How is your dogs?\" VS \"How are your dogs?\" \n\nAnyway, he said that my lack of punctuation until the previous message meant I was untrustworthy...ignoring the punctuation I had used previously in the DM conversation. Asked if I would send over kinks, limits n' whatnot or if we would continue to argue. I declined to continue, saying \"If we can't agree on base reality, an rp would be impossible\" I think that's pretty respectful, I had no ill will towards this guy, I expected a 'fairwell' before we parted ways. Instead, I was hit with \"I can't rp with someone who won't learn simple concepts. Enjoy your Ebonics\".... \n\nWhite and British...I have no words. \n\nAm I an ass? Was I wrong?",

            "selftext": "Quick backstory. Since I was 5 years old, I have been abused in *every sense* of the word by males. It was to the point that I was afraid of males for a long, long time. I now know they aren\u2019t all bad, but it still can be difficult for me to converse with them because all my issues aren\u2019t fully sorted, even all these years later. Note, I have no problem with men at all! It just takes a long time for me to be comfortable around them. So, when I find someone I have interested in rping with, I ask their gender, preferring women and non-binary individuals. If someone is somewhat weirded out by me asking, I simply explain the uncomfortableness I have around them and that\u2019s usually all it takes. Until today. \n\nI have been roleplaying for 7 years so I have asked this to probably hundreds of different people. I get the occasional \u201cwhy,\u201d but that\u2019s usually it. But this one person.. idk man. So, I simply asked \u201cquick question, are you a woman irl?\u201d And she immediately called me creepy. I first tried to explain myself, telling her how I don\u2019t really like to rp with males and also because I prefer women because I\u2019m a lesbian haha. She told me that was usually the question she gets before someone sends her a dick pic, so I said oh, well I\u2019m a woman so you don\u2019t have to worry about that in a joking way.. and she proceeds to tell me she doesn\u2019t want any \u201cunsolicited pussy pics either.\u201d I had NO intention on sending her anything nor did I give off the impression. Like.. at all. So atp, she\u2019s going on and on about how creepy I am when she\u2019s literally the only one being creepy. She began to compare the question to someone asking about bra size? I eventually just said fuck it, and decided to simply tell her I\u2019ve had a multitude of traumatic experiences with men.. and she told me I was using my past as an excuse to be creepy then unadded me. Good damn riddance honestly but what do you guys think? I was completely nice to her and utterly confused on why she was so pissed and rude. Do you think she has a few screws loose or would you be offended by someone asking you this too? \n\nAlso, please be honest with me. I know that I wrote about some sensitive topics and that might make you hold back, but don\u2019t. It was genuinely the first time someone had ever came off so hostile about such a simple question. It\u2019s never my intention to make anyone uncomfortable so if you think I should go about it a certain or different way, let me know. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "**Alt title: When people think they're going to be the sole exception.**\n\nAt present, I've been on a MxM search, largely because I've gotten tired of saying I'll write MxF and getting people (typically women) trying to either force romance or talk me into rewriting my characters to act as fulfillment to their kinks (no, my sweet teddy bear of a character will *not* kidnap someone and proceed to cause Stockholm Syndrome. Just no.). That's another gripe in of itself.\n\nSo, when I write my ads, I'm specific about what I'm looking for in terms of pairing \"MxM\", \"seeking another male character\", etc. I've bolded/underlined/italicized the pairing requirement. It never fails that I get several people wanting to write MxF. For the most recent ad I've posted, I've gotten five or six hits and only **one** was looking for MxM. The rest have entirely been MxF.\n\nSome are going so far as to using bait'n'switch tactics. I recently had someone approach me who was using neutral pronouns for their character while we were ironing out a plot, and I assumed they were writing a genderfluid or non-binary character. I was already having a few red flags about the idea (being told \"I'm flexible\" when asking about their character is...Hmm), but chose to continue with things anyway. We had things largely figured out and were going over some last minute details so I could start on my intro, when they suddenly switched to using she/her pronouns for their character.\n\nI'm tired of it. I can't tell if people are just glossing over things, even though my ad isn't that long, or are just willfully choosing to ignore things and hoping they can sneak past my requirements with a \"good enough\" plot.",

            "selftext": "I want to post another complaint because I am 36 and it seems like I am having a hard time finding a RP partner due to my age and limits. I actually prefer to be SFW or 'fade to black' because I don't want this to be another situation where I am just being used by another guy on the other end. I am here to escape from the pressures of the world, not be placed back in them. I can do smut occasionally, or certain NSFW elements, but I am not NSFW plot heavy and I have always had a hard time finding a RP partner due to this limit. A lot of guys who contact me want to do pure Erotica and I am not into that. For the longest time, I wouldn't even mention NSFW content and I would still get requests for it. \n\nMy other question is, where do you draw the line? For example, I have a best friend who is 23. So is it okay to RP with someone who is at least 23? I think I recently RPed with someone who was like 20-21, but she was also a girl and had some maturity for her age. \n\nAnd I must admit, the 18+ characters age limit gets to me. I recently got to play a mother with two young children and it was a relief, honestly. Just because there was mature content involving her, did not mean it was involved with the children. I am a protector of kids in that sense as well, but I always feel weird about trying to explain this sort of thing in my RP searches. I am one of those people who can RP any character of any age, as long as the content is appropriate within that age group. I could RP entire families with grand parents, for example. I miss these kind of RPs.",

            "selftext": "*sigh*\n\nLet me set the scene for you.\n\nThe time is 2 AM. I\u2019d stayed up late roleplaying after discovering I still had access to the internet. Naturally, after recently engaging with more Star Wars content, I decided to do a Star Wars role play.\n\nSo I pull up a game and start roleplaying. I was playing a former Jedi Knight who was currently a mechanic. This game had it set so you could have a description in your name so I had \u201cFormer Jedi Knight\u201d in mine. The time period I picked was the Galactic Civil War.\n\nA bit of context for people who aren\u2019t hugely into star wars - this is the time period where the rebellion was fighting the imperials. There were lightsaber wielding force sensitive individuals called inquisitors who worked with the imperials and were tasked with killing off or turning the remaining Jedi and finding force sensitive children. \n\nIt was going quite well at first - I did a couple of small things that led nowhere before deciding to set up a merchants booth in the busy streets of Tatooine. \n\nA couple of people came by - a girl looking for work and, after giving her an errand to run, an inquisitor approached my stand. \n\nHe (in character) walked up to me and wanted to know where I got my lightsaber from. I replied out of character that I didn\u2019t have one on me and if I did, it would be hidden. \n\nHe claimed I was a Jedi to which I responded out of character that there was no way he would know I was a Jedi due to the fact that I was hiding my presence as a force sensitive user and I had no lightsaber. \n\nHe insisted and walked behind me in character to claim he felt a lightsaber though my clothes. Okay, kinda weird but I clarified I don\u2019t have a lightsaber on me. I decided to pack things up since I didn\u2019t want to roleplay with this dude so I started putting my boxes on a floating platform to send away when I saw the girl I had asked for an errand for prior to the conversation. \n\nAs I was paying her for her services, when the inquisitor interrupted us and said that if he found a holocron (a sort of message box that only force sensitive people can use, aka, Jedi) in my boxes and therefore, I was a Jedi.\n\nWoah dude, slow down.\n\nOkay- first off, the crates were locked. Secondly, I had never mentioned having a holocron in my crates. Third, he could have planted it but why? I was just another random civilian in a large crowd of people. To me, this was blatant metagaming. \n\nI called him out on this and he relented and decided to pull something else on me. \n\nMeanwhile, someone else who was nearby was trying to just get me to teleport to the Death Star so that he would be happy. I refused, saying I didn\u2019t want to deal with this meta gamey BS. \n\nHe, in character, got a message from Darth Vader to kill me immediately. Out of character, he had just played Vader since we didn\u2019t have one in our server. His friend flat out denied Vader ever saying this and someone else decided to play Vader. \n\nI was relieved, thinking that I could finally be relieved of this stupid meta gaming stunt he was trying to pull me but of course, it gets worse.\n\nHis friend decided to play Darth Vader and, upon arriving on the planet and seeing me and the inquisitor, orders the inquisitor to kill me after he said he found a holocron in my crate.\n\nI was fed up and told him to stop meta gaming and that I would no longer be interacting with him. \n\nI began to talk with some other people who were out of character and he tried to arrest me while I was out of character. \n\nThat\u2019s where I decided to end things and hop off for the night.",

We both got uneasy if the other wasn't online during the designated time.*  \n\n\n*Now for his possessive nature.*  \n\n\n*Outside of the internet, I am a sex worker/erotic dancer, which leads to us posting lewd pictures/porn online all the time, which in return has always garnered us a fanbase.*  \n\n\n*Shortly after we began rping, he began referring to us as \"his\" and at first I didn't mind, because he claimed he has a \"possessive kink\" and in rp it can be pretty arousing....*  \n\n\n*But...*  \n\n\n*He started to attack any man who would approach or show interest in me on my content or writing prompts. It wasn't all the time, but it was enough to make us not wanna sext/rp  with any other man within his view.*  \n\n\n*I didn't like it, but since I had no attachment to these guys, I would let it slide, but often I felt frustration because sometime I was simply in the mood to erotic rp with other men. It was nothing personal. He was still my favorite, but he insisted that I clearly didn't need him around if I was going to entertain others...*  \n\n\n*We never discussed any rule where I wasn't allowed to rp with other men.*  \n\n\n*There was no serious commitment coming from his end that I felt could justify his possessiveness, but as he put it...(Not even my sexually open real life partner is this possessive &amp; he welcomed my online friend into my life.)*  \n\n\n*In his mind, I was just already his...us being a dancer and having a partner was just a bitter pill he already swallowed.*  \n\n\n*So yeah, after practically scaring off admirers and good potential Rpers from me.*  \n\n\n*He just left me.*  \n\n\n*I don't even know if he is alive anymore. He was physically sick with a fever going rampant in his country, and his last words were suicidal.*  \n\n\n*After weeks of crying and resorting to drinking to cope.*  \n\n\n*I just wanna move on without feeling like I betrayed him for moving on.*  \n\n\n*He clearly left without giving us a second thought.*  \n\n\n*People die everyday.*   \n\n\n*I refuse to believe something is soooooo grief stricken, that they can't tell someone they \"love\" they are still alive, but there has been a death in the family, after at least 30 days of mourning.*",

I've had people tell me before that response length doesn't really matter, as long as there's something for them to bounce off of.

Yeah I was pretty bad not speaking for every bad role player out there, I chalk a lot of my bad behavior up to my own Insecurities and Immaturity.  \nI knew what I wanted but didn\u2019t know how to express it to those who actually wanted to role play, Or In a few cases they didn\u2019t understand because English wasn\u2019t their first language\nThis of course frustrated me because I was unable to clearly express the things I wanted in a Roleplay. \nAnd in turn lead me to Snap at people good people who like myself just wanted to escape the boring day to day life. \nI should\u2019ve told said people we need to plan out the plot more, or can you be more specific as your expectations with this role? Communication was definitely the key. \n\nNSFW/Smut- I\u2019ll start with this one since it was the first one to come to mind. Starting off this was a necessity if you wanted to role play with me, of course it was a way to get my rocks off because deep down I\u2019m a lonely dude.\n \nAnd after a few sessions of roleplaying where my partners Leaned VERY heavy on this I found out what I really needed was someone who could balance the NSFW/Smut scenarios with the other Fluff that comes with role playing, Action, Adventure, Drama, Mysteries, Romance. Ideally a 50/50 mix seems realistic enough for realistic writing and development.\n\nGhosting- I\u2019ve done my share of it, in most cases I feel it\u2019s Justified maybe said person is being a Creep or Snob or maybe they\u2019re like me and too afraid to tell the partner they\u2019re not feeling the role-play anymore because they either don\u2019t want to hurt the partners feelings or they\u2019re afraid that if their partner finds out they\u2019ll get pissy because they\u2019re not having fun and enjoying the experience. \nPersonally I think some people are just incompatible when it comes to Roleplaying.\n\nSo yes I\u2019m a bad Role-player, but I\u2019m a bad Role-player who wants to get better at the hobby he loves and I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019ll get that chance for a redemption because while I\u2019m not perfect I\u2019ll try my ass off for the right partner.

            "selftext": "I was approached after posting an ad through my Reddit dms. I was excited and this writer gave me tons of details, replied to each detail in my ad, and dropped their discord. From there we moved over, they gave me a writing sample along with some ideas of how we could really get the hall rolling. Then\u2026nothing. Normally I\u2019m in no rush but after a few hours of nothing, I send a ping just to check in. From there, I see I\u2019m blocked.\n\nGetting ghosted is nothing new, it happens and I have no hard feelings, yet this one felt odd. They\u2019d put so much effort into messaging me, planning it out, then to block? I\u2019d barely even sent them many messages of my own ideas or questions. So, I come back to Reddit to ask what happened. Maybe they\u2019d just found a different partner or if I had done something wrong, I\u2019d like to know what for future interactions with any of my partners. After messaging them, the reply I got was NOT what I ever would\u2019ve guessed. \n\nTurns out, their partner had blocked every role player after taking their phone. Every. Single. One. What!? They profusely apologized and I couldn\u2019t help but just feel bad. Told them not to worry, wished them luck, and that was that. If they do happen to see this, I hope you\u2019re doing well mate.",

He, wanted to play someone caucasian, which to me is totally fine, literally makes no difference to me. I usually play as asian leads, as for me it\u2019s just more comfortable personally within my own life. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have chat logs like I normally do as this wasn\u2019t on reddit but another rp site, and he put me down about being asian.\n\n\u201cDo you think you could play like a blonde girl or something? I don\u2019t really like asians.\u201d \n\nLike what\u2026? The whole POINT of roleplaying is creativeness and such, why is race a factor? I\u2019ve had roleplays with interracial couple characters and that doesn\u2019t bother me at all, infact it\u2019s normal. Race of a character has never been something I cared about, this was the first time I ever ran into an incident like this.",
