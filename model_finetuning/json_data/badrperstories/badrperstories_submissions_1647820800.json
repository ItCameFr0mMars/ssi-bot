            "selftext": "***(Apologies in advance for a large personal ramble, I've just really needed to get all of this off of my chest, because it's been ruining one of my favourite hobbies for a long time, and I'd honestly appreciate some advice on just... How to deal with all of this.)***\n\nNow, this isn't a story about a specific roleplay that went oh-so-wrong with me, but a story about roleplaying in general, and how I'm on the brink of quitting, simply because what I've seen of the community is just so different to what I want.\n\nNow, to address the elephant in the room, I want to make something as *clear as possible.*\n\nI'm not very good at communicating my points, and so, you may read this and end up believing that I'm simply some guy who's \"Mad he can't be racist\" or whatever, and I want to make it as obvious and explicit as possible that this is not about me disliking the idea of people (especially historically oppressed people) being safe, or comfortable. **This is about me disliking the overly-sensitive majority of the online left, and their preaching of \"safespaces\" and censorship.**\n\nSo, I've been roleplaying for a decent amount of time. I started when I was about eight years old, participating in Dragon Ball Z roleplays on a game platform called *\"Roblox.\"* After that, I had moved on to several games, wikis, and other such spaces, until I discovered Discord. Since the beginning, I had noticed the issues that I'd properly realize recently, but I had overlooked them simply because of how convenient it was to roleplay on Discord, and how large the community was.\n\nAnd so, I started roleplaying on Discord, and got pretty obsessed with it. I loved making characters, writing stories, and seeing visible improvement in my roleplaying and writing over time. Because of how I started off roleplaying - In large groups like this, I've always been inclined to roleplaying in large groups, and so I continued doing that.\n\nEventually though, I noticed something. Eventually, it'd always end with some sort of fight, and me leaving the server. For a long time, I thought that they were entirely the problem, \"just a bunch of assholes\", and all that. Then, I eventually started to think that I was entirely the problem. That got in my head a long time, I thought I was an unlikable problem roleplayer, but then I realized, it wasn't a matter of a \"good guy\" and a \"bad guy\", or anything like that.\n\nThe issue was simply that I did not fit into the Discord roleplaying communities. We were totally different, and eventually, it couldn't become more clear. Though, I didn't quite understand just yet. I thought I was simply roleplaying in the wrong fandoms, (At the time, it was mainly things like popular Anime, Hazbin Hotel, or Steven Universe. Y'know, *those* kinds of fandoms.)\n\nAnd so, I tried some more \"gritty\" fandoms, or at least, fandoms I thought were \"Grittier.\" I went for things like more obscure animes, \"adult\" shows like South Park, and I even considered dealing with the intellectuals of the Rick &amp; Morty fandom. But, I was met with the same result each time. Overly-sensitive members, with lists upon lists of their \"triggers\" for the colour purple, or flamingos, or discussions of the Shrek movies (Not even kidding, all three of these were triggers I saw completely unironically posted in these kinds of servers.)\n\nAnd so here I am, finally having a sort of \"revelation\" after another year of trying to roleplay on Discord. Realizing that maybe I'm just not cut out for roleplaying. It's sort of tough.\n\nSorry for the incredibly long rant that ultimately didn't lead to anything, but I really needed to just say *something* about all of this.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Again, I doubt there's a way to prevent such a thing. I post a lot of roleplay partner searches on here, and I do establish in my posts I am a minor, so it becomes hard to find someone who, 1: is a minor, or two 2: isn't a minor, but is okay with roleplaying with one. Keep in mind I do explicitly SFW, so that makes it even trickier because most of the time if I don't mention whether I do SFW strictly or I do NSFW, the main bunch I get have the mentality of \"dude, i am just horny and need to nut, so PLEASE play a hot beach babe and i'll play some normal guy and then the two will \\[REDACTED\\]\".\n\nI think this was half a year ago? I'm not sure. But, I made a post about me searching for a partner. Someone reached out, everything was going a-okay, we actually loved the concept we created together. We were making our characters, and I told them that I had my character ready. They told me to send the info. I sent it, then a couple of hours passed. Okay, maybe they're busy, no big deal. Then the hours slowly turn into many days, and then I realized I may have been ghosted.\n\nI sent them a text, asking, \"Hey, are you okay?\" to see if they respond. No answer. Then, on this subreddit, I see they post some stuff about being ghosted/people they thought were \"annoying\". God, it makes me kind of angry, solely because they were complaining about BEING GHOSTED, yet they GHOSTED ME.\n\nTLDR: I was talking to someone and they ghosted me.

            "selftext": "I guess this isn't really a bad RPer story so much as a bad RP phenomena that makes me sad. :(\n\nSometimes you start a plot and you absolutely love it to bits and you love rping with the other person and you wanna keep doing it forever.\n\nBut sometimes and often eventually you just start to feel a distance in your partner's replies, not in them being busy or taking awhile. But like you can feel as if them writing anything is a chore for them.\n\nAnd I've been that person sometimes and when I'm not enjoying a plot I just flat out say so and we figure it out from there.\n\nBut some people will drag out their unenjoyment and it will usually either end by them ghosting you because they're scared of confronting the issue or their interaction with the plot will slowly deteriorate until it becomes a stagnant indifference and the story is never continued despite always being on the brink of continuation.\n\nIts just one of those things that disappoint me a lot. Especially cause I've had a lot of partners over the years who I've loved writing with and it gets to that point and then it's just over all of a sudden and abruptly.\n\nAnd then I lose motivation to do that plot again because I don't wanna invest in rebuilding a story that I've lost like 30 times. There was one specific fantasy plot I kept trying to do for like a year and it always fizzled out eventually. And it was a plot I invested a lot into. Writing miscellaneous lore entries, multi-page essays about different cultures and histories of countries in this fantasy world, of races and magic and gods and demons, etc etc. And then it all just culminated in that sinking feeling of, well I guess now I sit here and wait.. and wait... and its been a month. And now they've left the server.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had this rp partner for around 5-6 months now and things were going very smoothly, no extremely long waits for replies, good communication on both ends, great ooc chatter and an even greater plot that I honestly still adore. \n\nUp until about the past few months where things slowed down dramatically. I\u2019m used to waiting 1-2 days for replies with them as everyone has a life they have to put first and I had no issue with it since no one owes me their time, but now I\u2019m stuck waiting 4-7 days for just a reply ooc, nevermind replying to the rp. \n\nTo make matters worse, we\u2019ve been stuck on the same damn day in the rp for those few months and I\u2019m stuck playing my main character as well as some side characters I have 0 interest in playing. They seem to be dragging the side characters along for more than we even need them in the rp right now and they write more for the side character than their main. Oh, and they also push for srp between side characters which I just think is unnecessary for our plot and is just for their agenda.\n\nNeedless to say as much as I love the plot of the rp..the fact that it\u2019s taking so long for it to move and I\u2019m stuck at a part I don\u2019t like and playing characters I don\u2019t want is making me lose interest. Im not impatient and I don\u2019t mind waiting 1-2 weeks between replies when I genuinely enjoy the rp to the fullest and like the way the plot is moving. I didn\u2019t even have an issue playing the side characters when the rp moved faster but it\u2019s just a dragged on chore now. I don\u2019t want to take this out on my rp partner since they don\u2019t know how I feel about any of this, but I\u2019m slowly coming to a boiling point where I just want to come clean and either work around the issues or stop the rp. Any advice on how to do so??",

As someone who is 30, I personally cannot rp with someone under 18; honestly, even under 21 is a no-go. Even in a completely platonic SFW rp I have absolutely nothing in common with a teenager, and I like to have the possibility of being friends with partners. I know quite a few people don't feel that same, and that's fine, but I just wish more people would at least say 18+ or 25+ or whatever in their posts.",

            "selftext": "Not necessarily a \"bad\" rp'er story, but more a need for advice.  I'm a part of a multi-fandom one-on-one rp thing with someone I met just over a year ago. Lately... things are getting a little awkward, and I'm struggling. I'm really looking for some advice because the partner is lovely - most of the time - but I feel like I'm getting whiplash through our roleplays.\n\nWe've had a blast to start with; some of our roleplays were just outright crazy, but in an awesome kind of way. The more we got to rp, the more we got to know each other, which is fine, great by me (though I always use an alias despite how well I \"know\" someone (you can never be too careful). We vchatted over skype a few times, all good.\n\nNow though, things are going south, and I feel shitty about it, like I'm making a big deal out of it.  They ghosted me for a month just because they disagreed with me on a canon character, and only wanted to be friends again when I was ready to concede that I'd made an error in judgement - I'd messaged them during this retreat of theirs to find out wtf was going on as they'd posted a huge rant about how I'd created a \"negative energy\" for them and they couldn't deal with that - all I'd done was to disagree with a plot point they'd wanted to introduce with a character they'd been thinking of playing. \n\nIt's worth nothing that they \\*consistantly\\* push back against my character headcanons and thoughts, which I don't mind - I like discussing opinions and thoughts and such.\n\nLately though, the issue has been whenever the roleplay has gotten outside of what \\*they\\* want to roleplay, they coin it as \"character drama\" and start acting annoyed. Canonically, both our characters have gone through a lot, and whilst it's apparently fine for theirs to deal with that drama through roleplay (again, not something I mind! It's called character development, or I thought it was), when its my character, suddenly its \"drama, they're being a victim !\" \n\nI'm tearing out my hair and I don't know what to do. They're not very good with being approached about such things. \n\n(a note &lt; i had put up a thread under a different username, but I can't get into that account so I've had to create a new thread - with updated info, as more has happened since then! I hope thats ok! Posted on a throwaway account as well as I know they're on reddit. )",

            "selftext": "Most of you have probably heard of 'missing stairs'. If you'd like to read about missing stairs, please reference the wikipedia article. This is a post about missing stairs and why we should not keep discussion about them to back channels.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing\\_stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair)\n\nOf course there are some common unhelpful responses to missing stairs, and I am going to list some of them below.\n\n**Shouldn't we let the mods deal with it?**\n\nSure, when the mods are actually dealing with it. In this particular circumstance this is obviously not the case. Unfortunately this is common. Unfortunately, this is not the only RP hub that has a demonstrated history of allowing bad actors to stay. When your community refuses to remove harmful people from the community, the community reserves the right to make the behavior in question public once other means of taking care of the problem have failed.\n\n**Everyone deserves a second chance**\n\nUsually by the time a complaint about a user has caused this much drama, the user has been given second, third, fourth, and so on chances. See the point above about how this kind of drama generally boils over after a *long* period of inaction by management.\n\n**It's up to users to self-police**\n\nObviously the community was not self-policing if the user in question was allowed to become such a persistent problem that the community members felt the need to go public about their behavior.\n\n**But screenshots can be faked!**\n\nGenerally when multiple people are complaining about the same behavior from the same user, screenshots are not faked.\n\n**It's not fair to moderate private conversations**\n\nIf those private conversations involve predatory behavior, the behavior is a consistent pattern, and you as a moderator do nothing about said predatory behavior, you are part of the problem. 'It didn't happen here' is just a way to avoid having to have difficult conversations.\n\n**But if we discuss it, it will just cause drama**\n\n'Keeping quiet about it' allows the continuation of the same problems. Discussion of these kinds of issues should be allowed in order to ensure the safety of communities in question, even if the discussions must be kept to neutral 'here's what happened' terms. Silencing all discussion about the problem and keeping it to 'private channels' such as DMs just allows community missing stairs to continue being missing stairs elsewhere.\n\n**It's just the internet**\n\nSure, it's the internet. Problematic behavior shouldn't be allowed to continue just because it's the internet. This is a cop-out response that ignores the very real emotional and psychological impact of internet social behavior. If someone is persistently behaving in a dangerous manner, they should be removed for the good of the community. Sure, it's not as serious as say, someone that assaults people IRL, but it is still a problem.\n\n**The TL;DR is that the missing stair problem can be mitigated by openly having discussions about problematic behavior AND by removing people from the communities where it occurs when it is clear the behavior is a pattern. People should not have to be discreetly warned about the behavior of other community members. This is a sign of a deeply unhealthy community and these behaviors should be dealt with before it ever gets to the point of having a missing stair. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.**",

            "selftext": "For the past six months I have been role-playing with who I shall call A and the other RP partner B had started to join us now and then for RP. Things were going wonderful until last week when a retcon can up with another group I am part of and my character. \n\nIn all my years of Online RP this is the first time I have been this befuddled by a response from another writer and the whole thing is confusing to the point I came here to share the story. \n\nSo I approached A about the Retcon because it affected our characters, I explained that we would need to make changes to the story and I explained why the retcon had occurred it was caused by the need to remove themes belonging to the former group head when they left the group and shortly after the game. It was a very large retcon the took us back about 6 months. I enjoyed my RP with A so I wanted to work with them the create a new narrative so that things would remain cohesive. \n\nLong story short what was supposed to be a friendly conversation turned into the getting upset with me and not understanding why our story had to change, or why my characters may be different because of the loss of those six months of story and character growth/development. They accused me of \"doing this all the time\" but I never had a retcon before with them, they accused me of never being happy and always being dramatic but yet this was the first time in six months anything had happened beyond a \"hey I can't make it tonight can we..\" \n\nNext thing I know B is yelling at my, accusing me of punishing A because they had been in a.RP partnership for years before  I came along. This was actually one of the reasons I agreed to RP with A to begin with they had a history of long term RP with a partner which is something I look for. B ends up yelling at me for a while and then tells me I need to work this out with A. I was already trying to do that when the yelling started. \n\nDuring this yelling I learn A and B had been uncomfortable with me since we first started RPing together but yet I was constantly told everything was fine, they enjoyed writing with me, they wanted to keep going. It was nothing but comments of praise and enjoyment. So I do what any person would and asked how I made them uncomfortable. Days later I still don't know but it is my fault according to them. \n\nTwo days ago I got RP dumped in a very I am the problem not them way. I didn't even get so much as an apology for being so aggressive. The end of the letter basically invited me to contact them when I get my head on straight or change my ways. \n\nWould help if I knew what the problem was!",

We\u2019re all nice to them and they stick around for a day before making an announcement that they don\u2019t feel like they belong in the server. Alright, no problems, saving me another ghosted plot anyways. But when they left- almost every one admitted they knew of them beforehand and said they knew they wouldn\u2019t fit as they are a \u2018shifty roleplayer\u2019 I guess you could call it. \n\nSo my question is- have you guys encountered well known bad roleplayers?  How did it go? Were you the exception of where they didn\u2019t ghost like usually? I\u2019m just curious to hear if this is common!",

            "selftext": "I don't get it, but for the past 3 years I've had very little passion for roleplay, save in very few circumstances. \n\nIn essence, I found a really good partner and we clicked quite well, but we just had incompatible personalities and as I'm going through some mental health stuff, had to shut things down (for my sake and theirs, we each had our own stuff)\n\nIt's as if I haven't gotten past the things I was looking forward to in that RP, the good times, what I enjoyed, and can't recapture it.\n\nI also always end up leading 100% for other people. I always end up designing ads, prompts, pairings, that 'tickle' the right spot for people, romantically/character-wise - of whom I'll pick the best-suited, most compatible, most workable timezones/post schedules, etc - but then have no fun RPing with them. I'll just stumble along like a zombie, posting only a few times a day, then inevitably have to say I'm not enjoying things anymore. It's like I just turn into a puppet, play this fantastically attractive/awesome person and so I can't relate or enjoy it at all. RP becomes this giant chore which I'm obligated to attend to. \n\nOr I'll put out an ad, get a bunch of messages, then pick none of them. I just can't muster the energy, the excitement, the interest - none of it interests me. I have a spark of motivation, then realise I'm not looking forward to the RP at all.\n\nThe worst part is, I feel like a massive majority of people on Reddit just want you to do all the work and nail exactly what THEY want. They can't plan, gush, get passionate - they don't have a plan for what they want from an RP and just kind of expect you to both breathe wind into their sails and also create the sails to begin with, whereas the people I've REALLY gotten along with are super-intent, and so we make fireworks as we work together to make something cool. \n\nEvery day as I'm walking to work or walking home, I'll think about my characters, my storylines, my written setting/created world, the music I've attached to certain characters/events, potential commissions I could get one day, and just get sad thinking I have no one to do this stuff with. \n\nI've met some awesome people - really supportive friends and partners, never ever had problems/issues with them - yet I have no interest in writing with them, as we're just 'tuned in to different frequencies', as well as the above reasons. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on building up ideas, stories, ships etc that you genuinely really like and yet can still post about/share?",

            "selftext": "I joined a fantasy site that had pre-existing noble houses, where a history was outlined and a family tree had a paragraph describing each character. The rules said that houses could be rewritten by whoever claimed them. I claim one and discuss some ideas and changes with one of the two admins. All are approved.\n\nLater in the day, the admin messages me saying that staff decided to delete the rule about being able to rewrite houses. Changing anything other than characters' face claims will require admin approval, and none of the formerly approved changes will be allowed. Since 80% of my nearly-finished writeup is now negated, I decide to work on a different idea, and come back to the noble character later.\n\nThe new character is of a type that requires pre-approval due to IC rarity. I submit a pre-approval request that says they live in a certain place and have a certain personality. There were no restrictions for the type I was making, except that each member could only have two.\n\nThe admins reply the next day. They've created a rule that there can be no more characters of that type in the city where I'd planned to put mine, and an existing character of that type has the same motivation as my planned character, so part of my character's personality has to change.\n\nI reply to the message basically saying, \"Twice in two days, I've brought specific ideas to staff, and you've changed the rules just a few hours later to prohibit them. These rules affect nobody else on the site, and haven't been announced, so nobody else knows they've been changed. I'm beginning to wonder if your actions are targeting me.\"\n\nStaff's reaction was, roughly, \"The guidebook say the rules can be changed, so staff is changing them. Sorry if you feel that way, but you're overreacting by thinking that these rules have anything to do with you or significantly affect you.\"\n\nI entirely agree that admins can change whatever rules they want, and that not every rule change is targeting a member. But I disagree that the changes were insignificant, or that it happening twice in two days was coincidental. I let my writing partners and the admins know I was leaving and bounced. What say you, Reddit? Was I overreacting, or was that as weird as I thought it was?",

Lost interest in a particular roleplayer or roleplay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try my best to see the opportunities for a fun roleplay for whoever's involved. One of my favorite things in RP is to communicate with partners and discuss all the things we want to do and the fun ideas that can come from various people. But I've recently learned about a bit of a bias of myself. I have a friend who's passionate about it, but I completely lost interest in his \"style\" of writing as he tends to want RP's that *only* wishes for one solid path rather than letting us explore elements, or give frequent insecure OOC rambles about how his posts aren't \"good\" yet ignores the advice I've been giving him. (He's my friend so despite this I'm more than happy to reassure him and help his situation out however).  \n\n\nAnother instance on my mind is a former partner of mine having a 22 year old character crying to mine and asking to help me find his mom, but I got a *really weird* yet indescribable bad feeling about this person and on the side of me just... Not being interested in his character.",

            "selftext": "So I've got this old RP partner I just reunited with... I was very glad at first but now I'm starting to remember why we stopped RPing in the first place.\n\nShe's an amazing writer. Got the best ideas. Best characterization. Always available OOC to discuss.\n\nThe problem is that she's literally got like 30 characters, with 5+ threads each. She took my character's love interest and I was really excited because her interpretation of the idea was SOOO good. \n\nBut... She always takes 10+ days, sometimes half a month, to reply. It's always 1000+ word replies meaning our characters just over-analyze internally while barely anything happens per post so it takes like 5 months for one encounter to end.\n\nI was wondering if I'm the weird one here for losing interest if someone consistently takes 10+ days to reply. I usually take 2-5 days myself so it's not like I'm the Flash, but... Yeah. By the time she replies I just feel over it. We both need to re-read our previous post because we don't even remember what we'd written.\n\nI don't want to completely jump ship because I do love the plot, but I can't just tell her to ditch all her other threads and only reply to me, nor is there anyone else on the site I could do this plot with. Plus considering our friendship I know she'd be hurt if I asked her to drop the plot AND it would be awkward to give the character to someone else since she's already written several posts. We're so much alike otherwise but me having only 2 characters and wanting to focus on only a few plots at a time vs her having 100 plots, is apparently a dealbreaker. I'm really sad because I can see we'll never get anywhere at this rate.",

I agree. \n\nBut I personally am making the decision to set up boundaries for myself.

            "selftext": "I used to roleplay a lot on Amino.\n\nTypically, I did pretty short responses to try and get the RP to move quicker. It wasn\u2019t extremely short, mainly a three sentence minimum. \n\nHowever, as I kept roleplaying there, people started setting up standards that you had to follow if you wanted to roleplay in their chats. 3+, 5+, minimum of 8 lines. I even got in trouble for it once.\n\nI did try to write more lines but it always came out sort of forced. I also tend to drag my sentences a lot since I feel like I can cram it into one sentence so my sentence looks longer and I look like a better roleplayer(?).\n\nI also find that I tend to repeat phrases a lot while lengthening my responses as well as just putting a bunch of stuff into my response that the other person really does not need to know.\n\nAnyways- basically, now I can\u2019t do roleplays with people who type really long responses without being really anxious that I could fuck up at any second and feeling like I have to match their sentence length. It gets me really burnt out of roleplaying with people who type super good and long responses and I feel shitty about mine if it\u2019s even a couple lines/a sentence shorter than theirs. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t do roleplay over discord or text based apps anymore with strangers and why I resort to ROBLOX and Minecraft. Plus, the map and visualization of the characters makes me feel more engaged with the RP.\n\nI also generally feel like all my responses are pretty shitty due to people on Amino not interacting with my character because I literally can\u2019t write more than a paragraph (unless it\u2019s a descriptive intro) without having to force it and having the description feel generally forced. It just turned my favourite hobby into a chore.\n\nYeah, I like doing long responses but I prefer them when they come naturally. I dunno, thoughts?",

I also extended the offer of picking things up or starting a new roleplay if they came back because I both enjoyed the story we had together and liked their writing. Life continues on as usual, because I honestly barely knew this person and the bulk of our conversation were roleplay related. So, I didn't think anything would happen, because face it...It pretty much *never* does.\n\nTonight, they sent me a friend request, which I accepted, figuring it was either going to be an apology or them bitching me out for leaving. They sent me a message before I could send them one, which confused me because it mentioned a face reveal and \"words can't do it justice\". Suffice to say, I sure as shit didn't expect a post-surgery picture with blood when I clicked on their message. Trauma doesn't bother me, but...Ask first? I really don't need proof, a simple \"Hey, shit got wild and I had to take time for myself\" would have sufficed.\n\nI won't go into details on what happened, because I truly feel sorry for them and have no doubt that they're working through some shit, but...Lordy. Don't send that sort of thing to people you barely know and at least ask first.",

            "selftext": "Well, this one is interesting. \n\nSo I got a dm here on Reddit from someone who was wanting to RP. I thought he was interested in something from what I posted. \n\nWe exchanged discord usernames and moved there to discuss some things. I ask what from my request interested him and he completely ignored the question. Like stops responding for a day then comes back the next asking if I still want to RP. \n\nI say yes and he says he has some ideas. Which I thought they would be ideas for the fandoms on my list.\n\nFuck no. \n\nA DND campaign, a Star Wars Plot and and HTTRD plot.\n\nI told him I don't roleplay those because I'm not much into them. I said I already am in my first DND campaign and not interested in starting a new one right now, I don't know star wars and I don't want to RP HTTRD and he tells me to just pick one and he'll help me along. \n\nI decide to just entertain it to start with and pick the star wars plot. Which was a sort of Master/Slave plot. I assumed it was going to dive deep into story so I start asking questions and such regarding making a character and how the heck Star Wars slave market works. \n\nThis guy tells me Twi'Leks are most popular and sends me a lewd photo of the Twi'Lek Jedi from Clone wars. He tells me they are popular because of beauty and their seduction charm. \n\nI ask my boyfriend and while that is true there was more lore into the reasoning of inclusion to being out inti the slave market. (My boyfriend is a major star wars nerd and he was getting a kick out of this guy's attempt at getting a roleplay to bust a nut to an alien girl of his dreams) \n\nThis guy tells me my information is wrong! Like I brought up the other reasoning for them being slaves was because the Twi'Lek leaders sold their own people for money and power. And he only sends me the portion of Twi'Leks being used for prostitution and their beauty. \n\nSo I ask if I have to be a Twi'Lek. He says no and sends me three other races that he says are HIS favorite. Mirialans, Tortugas, and Zeltrons. Doing my research, I couldn't see one normal image. They were all over sexualized and it was driving me nuts. I didn't want to be included in a sexual rp. I was expecting story and to learn lore and instead this guy is using me saying of my lack of Knowledge about star wars to his advantage. \n\nI tell him if I have to be thsoe races and he said no and I have to be someone humanoid and nothing furry. \n\nI was tempted to make a whole wookie character to just spite his dumbass. \n\nInstead I actually get more into my research and make a great idea where I was going to make a smuggler Character. \n\nI sent the following: \"i'm going through the list and I have an idea to make a smuggler character that had been captured and turned over towards the slave market because her 'partner' had made a deal behind her back to sell her and get a good amount of money for her exchange. She's sold to the person who she had made a deal to smuggle slaves for and instead she let them go because she despised slavery and her partner was not very happy about her choice and had essentially back stabbed her for the choice she made\"\n\nI thought that was an amazing idea that could work with his plot in a way that maybe she's bought out and maybe brought right back into her smuggling business and such. \n\nThis guy just says \"alright. Do you have a reference pic?\" \n\nNo discussion or anything! Like I was expecting us to throw ideas back and forth and my boyfriend even thought that I made a good idea for a character for my first time creating one! Not to mention, I decided that she was going to be a Balasor but I didn't tell the guy at all. \n\nI asked this guy for feedback and more discussion and he responds with \"Character looks good\"\n\nI wanted to scream! I was done and no longer interested in tending to his wet dream fantasy on Star Wars while I gained a more in-depth interest in story. \n\nI sent this: \n\n\"I don't really think this will work out. I feel like there's some lack of excitement or energy in the planning and it's making me feel quite unmotivated. \n\nMy roleplay request initially had the fandoms I was looking for and you changed them to your fandoms and plots that I have said and made clear I've never roleplays nor had much of an interest in doing. Which further grows my lack of motivation. \n\nTo save you from wasting time in responses that are just gonna feel like a chore, I think I'd like to end things here and I'll wish you luck on your search for a partner that can match the energy you're looking for in a roleplay. \n\nGoodbye.\"\n\nNo response back which as expected. I'm just pissed that my first time getting interested in a star wars RP was my lack of knowledge being used so this guy can have his little fantasy played out. \n\nI decided to keep my character idea and continue developing her for a possible and hopefully better rp in the future. \n\nLet's just say while I was pissed at this guy, my boyfriend thought it was hilarious. Which not that I minded. I was just disappointed about this dudes attitude about the whole thing.",
