            "selftext": "I'm curious as to what anyone's thoughts are when it comes to some frustrating ambiguity in the rules of a certain subreddit that I won't name, but context clues will probably allow you to figure out. I'm guessing it's the most popular adult roleplaying subreddit? \n\nLet me just say that I completely understand it, gotta smack down the people who want underage character RP in smut, but it was personally a bit frustrating for me. \n\nSo I enjoy smut and ERP, but I also like to play around with a nice story and explore worldbuilding. I personally am one for lots of humor and comedy, but I explore different topics that interest me alongside like minded partners. \n\nSo there was a post I made that included the characters Tifa Lockhart and Cloud Strife from the Final Fantasy series. Pretty well known canon staples. I was fully aware that any canon characters had to be of age (obviously), which I was under the impression that they were (Tifa is 20 and Cloud is 21). The post was struck down and I got a strike on my account for attempting to use underage characters, which confused me because I was certain they were of age based on their in game bios. One valid underage example would be Yuffie Kisaragi, who is 16 canonically, never mentioned in my post, and I'd be uncomfortable roleplaying with this character. \n\nSo I inquired about the issue, stating that the characters are canonically of age. They reply saying that the age ranges of the characters are 14-29 or something, so I have to specify the *exact* timeline that demonstrates they are of age. Well... I think every game with those characters they are of age. Maybe in flashbacks or something, but I'd think taking into account *every* minor scene of *every* canon is a bit much. I would think it was obvious that the main game was being referenced, where they have always been of age throughout. Maybe some bigger FF7 stans can shine a light, lmao. \n\n...and that's just *one* specific example. Being a canon roleplayer must be a headache over there. \n\nNevertheless, the strike still remains on my account. Bummer.\n\nAs I stated before, I completely understand wanting to go hard on ageplayers. That shit brings out sketchy people and gets subreddits removed. But I think this goes a bit too hard on completely innocuous roleplayers.\n\nFeel free to share any thoughts if you wish!\n\n**Edit for clarification**: This was not an automod/bot removal. This was hand removed by a moderator.",

For the right RP partner, I'm even flexible about playing canon characters I've never tried playing before, so long as I know the source material.\n\nI've played all sorts of ships with these canon characters, from canon x canon pairings, to OC x canon pairings. Both of them had been very rewarding to me. I've encountered a few OCs that were very entertaining and fun to play with! But sadly that's not always the case.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'll see a recruitment ad for someone wanting a specific canon character, or worse, they'll give you a selection of canon characters to pick from to give you a false sense of choice in the matter lol. And then once I start talking to them, I realize that they actually want you to play a specific canon character in a very specific way (even if they gave you a choice) just to fulfill their weird fantasies.\n\nOn top of that, their character isn't even that interesting. Usually their only personality trait is being \"super strong\" or \"drop dead gorgeous\" or unusually amazing for the universe of that fandom. It's super boring and it just feels like RPing with these people would be a chore.\n\nI actually had to decline a guy recently because of this specific problem. He gave me very little choice in who I played and tried to dictate how I would play them, and then gave me a very boring Mary Sue-ish character. I almost wish I ghosted him because he got pissed when I politely told him that I didn't think it was going to work out. And then after I blocked him for being rude, he harassed me on Reddit lmao.\n\nI think I'm going to have to either stick to canon x canon pairings from now on unless I'm RPing with a trusted partner, or I'm going to have to be incredibly strict with OCs.

But still, overall atmosphere of RP community over Reddit/Discord is really discouraging.\n\nI mean, not only getting a RP partner does sound like applying for a demanding job, apparently you need to constantly double check, if each message is phrased in exact perfect way. At that rate, before I could use RP as a stress reliever I'd gain more stress just, you know... RP induced one.\n\nI don't want to feel like I have to constantly prove my worth to yet another person in my life. Or like I ought to beg for a chance of RP. I don't want to stress over being perfect. But now it feels like it's a norm for RP community nowadays.\n\nIs there any hope, that it wouldn't be as stressful as it seems now?",

If you're not writing steaming hot smut, this probably isn't as big of a deal to you, but those who *do* write steaming hot smut tend to use Discord as well, so!\n\nI'm really, really concerned about their lack of privacy. As far as I've gathered, *they don't encrypt anything.* Not only that, but they have stores of data of when you open games and applications and timestamps on it all. All stuff that could likely be linked to your real identity unless you're careful.\n\nYou might think \"Hey, I trust Discord\", but what if they get hacked? It's unencrypted, just lying around, waiting to be taken. Do you trust black hat hackers with that kind of info?\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but as a privacy advocate, I'd really *really* love for the ERP community to move on to just about anything else.\n\nSorry if this doesn't fit the subreddit's theme! Wasn't sure where else to put it.\n\nA source: [https://stealthoptional.com/how-to/is-discord-encrypted-2021-how-private-and-secure-is-discord/#:\\~:text=Discord%20as%20a%20platform%20is,encryption%20of%20its%20video%20chats](https://stealthoptional.com/how-to/is-discord-encrypted-2021-how-private-and-secure-is-discord/#:~:text=Discord%20as%20a%20platform%20is,encryption%20of%20its%20video%20chats)\n\nAnother source, but it's reddit, so yeah: [https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/eiicah/trawling\\_through\\_my\\_discord\\_data\\_package\\_after\\_35/](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/eiicah/trawling_through_my_discord_data_package_after_35/)",

Anyone breaking that rule will be banned, no question, no appeal.\n\nOn a slightly related note, I've introduced the Shitpost/Satire post flair, appropriately color brown. I'm sure some of you will get a lot of use out of it.",

There shouldn't be such a massive difference in perception just because of something silly like over ten years of life experience, marriage, and kids. They don't change your outlook or goals on life that much.\n\nBesides, it doesn't matter anyway if I just round up my age a little. 17 and three quarters is the same thing as eighteen, right? I'm totally an adult, and the adults around me tell me all the time how mature and adult I am. I'm totally mature for my age, just RP with me for a little bit and you'll totally be blown away with how well I understand complex things like adult relationship dynamics and the struggles of building a career. \n\nAnd it shouldn't matter anyway if we're playing fantasy, that's not like the real world. Mature understandings of character dynamics can totally be gotten by an 18 year old whose only life experience is being in high school. I'm making it up anyway, you won't notice.\n\nJust stop being so discriminatory, god.",

It's not that hard to just say 'hey I'm not interested anymore' and not have to fucking block me three messages in. Does nobody have any communication skills or clarity anymore? Fuck's sake.\n\nSo what if I totally ignored one or two of the requirements in their ad? Writing smut is NOT a big deal, it shouldn't be such a big thing for them to INSIST on not putting any of it in the ad. And I know they said they only wanted to write with writers the same gender as themselves but that truly shouldn't matter, I can still tell a good story and it's total hogwash to assume I can't just because of that.\n\nI mean, come on, we got FIVE messages into planning and that's FIVE messages of time I won't get back, it's TOTALLY UNFAIR that they blocked me after I asked if we could make the western RP they asked for cowboy bebop themed instead. They both contain cowboys so I truly do not understand what the big deal is here.\n\nJesus christ just stop ghosting!!!!",

            "selftext": "After an RP gets started, I tend to have a lot more trouble with handling character requests. \n\nNow there are plenty of times that a request does fit what I had in mind, or can be worked in. But then... Well, about a third of the time, right as I start getting comfortable with a character, my partner will ask for a change. And, even though it's a small change, I just can't do it.\n\nSo, as a rule I like to make characters that my partners are interested in. If they have a list of likes, I'll incorporate some. If their prompt has some obscure references, I'll look them up. If they have some contradictory requests, I'll try to make it work.\n\nI'll ask my partners what they want out of my character, and dig around in the scenario too. Just to make sure that I really get everything I can for the character.\n\nNow when that's done, I tend to make fairly complex characters. I like to mix up all the pieces, contradictions, inspirations, and let it bake. So I end up with layered characters. They feel one thing, think a second, act a third, and say a fourth.  There's a lot to them, but as a result they end up more holistic. Each piece sort of mixes with the others.\n\nAnd at some point that gets set. I can't make these brownies into caramel ripple brownies. They're too set. I can drizzle some caramel on top?\n\nNo I'm sorry, it's too late to make this character into a batch of chocolate chip cookies. They're brownies and definitely not cookies or a cake.\n\nThe way this usually comes up is that after a few rounds in the RP, my character is set, starting to become solid. And then, that's when my partner starts coming in with requests.\n\nNo, I'm sorry, my college minded cheerleader who has no brain-space for nerd things would not suddenly  have her own personal sexy cosplay to wear over to your character's house. And even if she did, why would she? They're entirely platonic friends.  He's her neighbor that she wears frumpy clothes around, bakes cookies with, and watches 'those space robot cartoons' with.\n\nYes my character is a princess. No she's not going to go into a dungeon barefoot and in a dress. She's been preparing for this her whole life. She's wearing boots and practical pants. No she's not wearing a thong.\n\nYes, she's an alien working with humans for the first time. No she isn't entirely ignorant of human culture. She went to the spacefleet academy where there were humans and took courses specifically on how to deal with other species because she's a *diplomat*. You picked that, remember? And further....\n\nNo my gentle poet turned soldier isn't going to shout. If he gets emotionally abusive it will be by drawing away and composing some really terrible sonnets. He definitely won't get physically abusive.\n\nThis is why I ask early. This is why I ask 3 times.\n\nThe funniest circumstances are when I'm more or less handed a bucket of traits, some history, and a few contradictions. And then after I work it all out, I feel like \"Look, I don't know what you're asking about. The character is obviously like *this*. You wrote them this way. It should be obvious!\"\n\nSometimes I don't know how anyone can RP with me. \ud83d\ude02",

            "selftext": "Yeah as you can see from the title, this man. I will get to the story.\n\nAs of recently I joined a public rp chat after I got some ptsd from the last one (Let's say it turned me off big group roleplays for a while). I decided to try it again. I found someone that is pretty relaxed, open for discussion about character development, story plots and many other things as long as we discuss it with them. After cracking the big brain rp password we waited for the host to start. They made it easy for a starter, you character is injured, saved and brought brought her humble abode. This is from what I heard from them, to prevent the all too common *Starts half a world away* sort of deal. We have one dude however who didn't apply said starter. Instead he just waltzes in with his belongings like its a vacation. Okay? Fine I guess it's a one off. I will call this dude Jeremy. Screw it, I don't have a name and I am sorry for using your name Jeremy. Don't feel offended. \n\nBasic tidbits I found out about Jeremy. \n\n1. If you oc isn't female, don't expect any meaningful or long term conversation. If you are dude all you get is one response and that's it. If he doesn't give you that or male ocs are the only options, he just ignores you. Not once, not twice but until you use a good looking female oc. This can turn out creepy.\n\n2. This man can't get the entire setting. We rp a game and it's after the apocalypse. This dude however, makes it a car show. There are millions of cars out of order, and by nature, decomposition is happening yet this man finds fully working cars in a world where you can't even drive because the roads are far from clear. \n\n3. Doesn't know when to quit, self explanatory. Either if the chat dies a bit due to timezones (Yes most of the participants aren't in Europe but in the USA and not all in the same timezone either) he is literally typing something every half hour. I understand enthusiasm but Jesus christ and if we still don't respond he says it's dead. \n\n4. And the most important aspect, he wants attention. Is your oc busy somewhere else? Having a meaningful conversation? Oh shit you have to go to him now because he responds to you while teleporting mind you. It's a mansion yet he can call people from 2 stories and 7 different locations to draw them to him. An lastly, remember point 1? Yeah he has eyes on one particular oc and if they don't come to his attention seeking he comes to them and tell them a sad story or have something that would incur fluff. \n\nSo as you can gather this is basically our deal. We went over the basic things like railroad yet we have so much freedom to do whatever we want on said railroad. It's just a sort of pointer and guide. \n\nDog = My oc \nMaria = host oc\nPrincess = Female friend oc \nKillian = male friend oc \nIan = New to rp guys oc\nSeoi = innocent bystander to it all\nLovely smile = female oc number 2 \nJeremy = Problem dude \n\nCH:1  LET THE SIMP BEGIN\n\nSo chapter 1, we went over the rp and had some basic conversation like where everything is and what everyone's basic skill was. After Maria dropped off Jeremy she went with dog to the basement and he kept talking to her 1 floor up. Maria who he was talking to tried to be nice and just rolled with it. After that my dog basically went to train with what would be his future friend named Killian. He seems like a Killian anyway back on point, when dog and Killian were alone. Jeremy decided to be smooth criminal and hitting on Maria. After he began to notice that maybe it wasn't the best course of action he deleted it and gave a different reply. However this is not where his advances would stop. He would then visit my dog and Killian to ask about a car because Maria might like it. We just went with it and I rolled my eyes behind the screen. Jeremy then tried it again, in the weapons room to dance with Maria. Maria said she didn't know how and shot him down. After forging a weapon for Killian and dog promising him that if Killian would break the prototype he would kill him (Nice reference for who knows anime). In any case this is where I went to sleep because of work next day and oh boy I missed something. Apparently dude also tried to get the charms on with princess. However princess just puts down pure logic about her oc. They don't know eachother so don't act like they do and Jeremy did it multiple times that it just annoyed her. He left the ooc chat for the day (This is a trend btw). I asked princess what happened and she explained it. And also that Jeremy has a track record with her altho small, still noticeable involving her female oc. In any case after a while chapter 1 ended after meeting some npcs and it is a pretty chill rp chat.\n\nCH2: I DONT CARE. I AM JAKE THE DOG \n\nAs you can read time for chapter 2. Listen, some parts were not that handy from us but this came a bit from frustration. \n\nSo chapter 2 roles around and we get simple role calls. What everyone does in the chat and who becomes vendors. Jeremy decided it was time to show off his charms. He would defy the orders of Maria, drive a car (we don't know where he got it from like many of his things) and come back with things we don't need. Okay? Where the good sir got a fine working car in the apocalypse where 99% of it is just beyond repair but that's besides the point. What is on point is that he then went to the kitchen and used an air Fryer (No joke and no scam) to make dinner for people who don't need it (Yes our ocs are immortal and don't need food to survive. They can die from injuries, getting stabbed, shot, slashed. The whole shebang but not due to a lack of water and food) here is where Ian comes in. Ian is new to group rps but he responds to respond. He didn't read my rp reply and admitted he didn't read it. We all facepalmed and moved on however just like Jeremy, Ian was a bit impatient as well and after waiting for half a day he decided; \"You know what? I am stuck here but I can't wait. I will just move away in the middle of the conversation\" and it messed things up. \n\nAfter cooking dinner Jeremy decided everyone now has a communication device. Me and Killian said we don't have any active recollection of every receiving one. Ian foolishly went to the kitchen, craving interaction and was instead used by Jeremy to summon everyone. The host however stopped his little scheme by saying we don't need it. Then he decided to do the most masculine thing ever. Show off the tattoo to Maria. We all cheered and okay I will quit the bullshit right here.\n\nAfter some attention seeking of Jeremy by either trying to incur fluff to injuries that can heal within minutes mind you, or passing out. He introduces a new oc who now tries to divert the attention to Jeremy. No one off course responded.\n\nThis is however where things get interesting. The owner of lovely smile had a new oc he wanted to show. This he showed and when Maria and princess said he looked good Jeremy decided he needed a new appearance as well. Blatantly copying the oc (Yes for concept. We can make our own oc in game, and use it to rp in text after a wiki is made on amino). Apparently everyone except lovely smile noticed it. I then got invited by Maria and princess into a pm chat with Killian, lovely smile and Seoi. The edits were made of the comparison. Maria was ranting because Apparently and this is what I haven't told you yet. Jeremy finds it cute when she is sleeping and dreams about Maria (The oc). Host was a bit...creeped out to say the least. However as amino dictates in a sense that we don't want to give Jeremy a way out. Maria has to make a report and me and lovely smile will handle it but only then. Why? We can't decide for Maria and it will Jeremy a way out saying me and smile are abusing our powers as leader. Seeing how petty he is we all agreed that yeah..only in report form we will take action. \n\nSo next up was the sparring match and listen, I don't care how canonically powerful my oc is. I just like to make an absolute fool out of him. Like I said, strength and Canon power doesn't matter if you aren't using your brain and I hate the concept of my oc just beating every oc on brute force. This is how I balance it out. He is powerful when it counts not when we are having some banter or in rp sparring match. There are no stakes there so I don't have to make my oc go all out. What's the point? \n\nIn any case, dog pissed off one of the npcs by breaking a wall after punching a hallucination. He was alone with the blacksmith npc and we had some good times. Then Killian comes in, after raiding the kitchen for food Killian vented and used a date of a game he likes before the vent broke into the training room. Maria and Jeremy were alone and she did not like that cause well..Jeremy is creepy. So we all barged in. The noise killian made, drew everyone to the training room and dog decided to challenge Jeremy in, as you guessed it a way that would make anyone not take him seriously. And Jeremy ignored him not once but for the entire time but his inner simp for Maria took over and after ignoring her one time he decided that yeah. I will grab my chance now. However we knew that is what he wanted so dog and Maria would spar and Jeremy and lovely smile would after Killian and the npc would fight. \n\nJeremy decided to be a flirt again and booped Maria and lovely smile on the nose. Tidbit about lovely smile, we call her that because she almost never smiles and my friend was like \"She does smile just not often\". In any case, lovely smile isn't intimate. The owner said he wanted to try it and I said he can choose. Not my shtick not my choice. But his oc just kicked the shit out of Jeremy and pinned him to the ground. This is where Jake the dog would come out because me, seoi and smile all do martial arts. A shoulder pin to a prone position is just a tap out. He decided he could headbutt smile. We just called him out on it saying there was no way and he said \"He is on something\". I decided to double down and say that is simply impossible. A shoulder pin is a shoulder pin no human would get out of that nor immortal either. He decided to delete and try again until smile gave him a choice, tap out or your oc gets more injuries. He tapped out and his oc was crying. \n\nAfter the npc that was fighting Killian mocked him and continued until Maria stopped it. I told Maria whatever you do, you can autocounter my hit. I don't care, I'd rather lose and make people laugh than win. So it happened that dog God murdered by smile for hitting her accidentally. Jeremy couldn't take it however and left the ooc chat again to then vent his frustrations, screaming things about mocking his honor, after that he decided to be an ass. He then tried to get some sympathy points again in different ways. Including wanting to incur fluff again. The saga will continue until Jeremy leaves the chat or the rp ends. Either way, I have content. \n\nTLDR: SIMP tries to get attention from the host and after not biting and deflecting, he became pissy and became a not so nice person to rp with. \n\nPs: I told the host today again that if at any point she feels uncomfortable she can tell us and report it and me and smile will deal with it. We will see how far we will let this go.",

            "selftext": "Alright, real quick I want to make it clear. This isn't a post directly attacking or harming any specific roleplayer or how roleplays in general are priority over real things and stuff like that. This isn't about that, I want to make that very clear. I generally respect my roleplayers and despite my inability to comprehend people's mental problem (and other things that I won't go over here) what I will bring up is the general pattern I've gotten. With that out of the way let's begin.\n\nSo I'm sure you've all struggled with searching good roleplay partners in general. It feels like 3/4 of the time they drop you, unfriend or block you last minute and it gets annoying. Not to mention even when they don't 3/4 of those roleplays you do establish either ghost you, leave it, or they get too busy or depressed to roleplay.\n\nNow I'm not here to bash people who have real mental illnesses or who do get busy at times and can't roleplay. I sadly suffer from alexithymia (though not a mental In it of itself) and personal depression. However I never really make it public and in fact (and this is just me) usually become more productive to roleplay because of certain emotions. Because often times I roleplay to distract myself from real life.\n\nIs fun to roleplay, gets my mind off of things and while I understand not everyone's the same. It still bothers me that because of so many variables, so many people often don't roleplay or continue and when they do continue is basically a little before they return to whatever it was they were doing.\n\nNow again I'm not trying to bash people because of real things they do have, be it them being busy or suffering from mental health. However I do want to address this problem that has just kept popping up consistently throughout most of my roleplayers.\n\nNow I do love and respect my roleplayers as people, but the problem still remains. Like I personally do roleplays to disconnect from real life, take a load off and have fun. I'm not a therapist, heck I'm the least qualified to be a therapist. I can't comprehend people's emotion, much less in text form. So if I as a person can't comprehend people's emotion, what chance do I have in helping them?\n\nSure I try my best but again I'm not a therapist. I never will be sadly. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI wish I did had some sort of power to make all problems disappear, but there's no such thing.",

She was doing one-liners, no dialogue, no build-ups, straight action. \n\nSecondly, I understand people have their kinks and fetishes. I'm more of a romantic-sexual person and she liked hard-core, bdsm, bondage, gross stuff done to her and I just couldn't do that. I did tell her my limits but she kept insisting on being used and abused. \n\nLastly, I'm busy and have other hobbies, I'm out running errands and appointments and she would keep wanting to role-play and would send a question-mark if I disappeared for more than 2 hours. \n\nI told them I'm done and abstaining from this kind of sexual behavior.

I was against it, since my OC came from a different country and time period than his. But I would allow an added part that was RP only about how they met at base. That wasn't good enough for Richard, he wanted his OC to be in the backstory, not some added part in base.  \n\nHe didn't want to talk about it more so we kept doing the RP and... his OC would talk about the shared history with my OC, despite me saying I was against it, then said \"if you do not believe me, then kill me.\" My OC didn't do anything since I was kind of floored, and the next ten minutes was Richard repeating that line. One variation was \"I am your oldest friend, but if you do not trust me, then kill me.\" \n\nI had mine simply say \"I don't know who you are, but you're being a bit crazy.\" And Richard messaged me again to give me this new backstory to my OC that he wanted. I read it again and realized it was all about his OC and not mine, how his was this savior and protector of mine and did everything. Which completely destroys the story of mine being an orphan who became a hero. \n\nAnd Richard insulted me for being stupid and not just accepting his \"improved\" version of my OC's backstory.

It's just good enough that I don't want to leave, because some part of me is genuinely having fun and it's quite hard to find compatible roleplay partners, but there's always this other part of me that wonders if there could be *better* roleplays out there, and if I'm locking myself into a roleplay that's about 65% of what I want.\n\nUsually, these roleplays die out over the course of weeks or a couple of months, or get put on hiatus since one of us isn't quite 'feeling it' anymore.\n\n...whiiich leads me to this post. To all my fellow RP-ers out there, have you ever been in the same boat? How did things end up? What would you do in situations like these?",

            "selftext": "This isn't specifically a story, more just a small \"rant\",+ genuinely for asking.\n\nNow I have a seperate account for roleplays to keep things more organised for me, and that account has mostly around the same..maybe 4-5 promops/ads over the months/last year, some fandom related and some just completely originally. However what they all have in common is me wanting to play specifically MxM if it's in a romantic setting (which I do alot of, admittedly). Roleplay for me isn't very.. \"serious\", it's more of a hobby to kinda escape life and stuff- so sure, i know limiting myself to mostly MxM, etc. may be seen as sort of bad, but it's kind of what I'm comfortable with, and enjoy writing, so I'm fine with that limitation for now. I've met some really great partners that has been amazing working with, so my ads do work usually, atleast to some extent.\n\nWith context out of the way- why do I still get people messaging me about wanting to do something MxF when I try my best to express that's not what I'm looking for? \n\nMy title will always say something like \"M4A playing M, (roleplay title)\", and ill try to mention atleast something in the actual ad about what im looking for. The reason I always decide to put \"4A playing M\" is because I genuienly could not care less what you Idenity as behind the screen, and i don't wanna limit myself to only male writers, when in the end I don't really mind what gender YOU are. If you can write a good male character, your personal Idenity isn\u2019t going to bother me. And well, I guess I just sorta assumed people understood what I meant, especially cause of the very specific \"playing M\".\n\nBut again, it seems no matter what I do, I always attract atleast SOME people whos very convinced on doing MxF, some even being so stubborn they'll tell me \"you didn't state otherwise.\", where i had to personally re-send my own ad and highlight the parts where I did. (Keep in mind, in this specific example, I even stated INSIDE the ad like twice what I wanted.)\n\nAre people just kind of bad at reading ads properly, or is my wording really just that confusing?",

            "selftext": "this is going into bad rper experience cuz oh boy. Ohhh boy.\n\nSo lemme explain the gate keeping stuff. \n\nRoleplay is different for everybody, right. Some people are just in it for the smut, some people just want to roleplay fluff, some people want super intense plots, some people want to touch in serious topics (such as racism or SA), and some people are just here to vibe. There is nothing wrong with any of these approaches as long you\u2019re not disrespecting boundary\u2019s. \n\nI am personally those people who likes to rp out intense plots and serious topics, as well as just the fluff and smut. I always mention in my roleplay stuff what my characters content entails and that if these bother you, I rather you don\u2019t try to interact with them because I am not going to water them down. I know my limits and my boundary\u2019s, and I don\u2019t want to overstep on anyones else\u2019s. And even then, surprise surprise, I don\u2019t want intense plots everyday. I get drained from work and school and sometimes I just want to do fluff. Or slow burn. Or whatever. Sometimes I\u2019m not even in the mood to write! Because believe it or not RP isn\u2019t even a job! Writing isn\u2019t even a main hobby of mine, drawing is!\n\nAnyway, so lemme talk about this gate keeping former moot.\n\nNever have I seen someone take roleplay so seriously before in my life like it pays their bills. Look, I\u2019ve met a fair share of RPers who took RP a bit too seriously but holy crud this former moot makes the previous interactions look like NOTHING. \nThey actively shame people for \u201cnever wanting convulted plots\u201d and that \u201cthey don\u2019t have an excuse because roleplay is a writing hobby\u201d. It\u2019s like, dude you literally just said it yourself. Roleplay is just a hobby. It\u2019s actually not that deep.\n\nThey were also the type to make everything 1 on 1 since it\u2019s the OC world where things tend to take place in the \u201cUS,\u201d and translate everything one for one, down to the police corruption and the abuse / mistreatment towards POC. It\u2019s to a point they actively shame people who \u201cskirt\u201d these issues around their muses, even claiming as far they\u2019re being racist towards their muse cuz their muse grew up in a US centric society and thus was rude to their OC, when in reality their OC was actually just fucking rude and that\u2019s why the other OC didn\u2019t react well. Like, dude I\u2019m a first generation POC and I don\u2019t want to roleplay / acknowledge how the society my OC lives in would want them fucking deported. I come to roleplay to ESCAPE. I\u2019M TRAUMATIZED IRL AS IT IS. \n\nI forgot to mention they refuse to accept accountability for their OC\u2019s and out of characters behavior, and will always find a way to blame the other RPer. And I feel really dumb that I somehow thought I was going to the exception to their behavior.\n\nThey always blew off our ships, they always blew off my OC\u2019s, the plots I actually wanted to do with their OC, but they only ever actually engage when it\u2019s on \u201ctheir\u201d times, and it pissed me off because it\u2019s like\u2026 you go on pages and pages worth of angry rants on your account when people do this to you, but it\u2019s okay that you do it? They\u2019ve said some incredibly transphobic shit to me too when I tried to come out, and when I told them not to insult me like that they just outright told me they\u2019re not going to apologize because of course. Of fucking course you\u2019re not. \n\nSo it\u2019s okay to claim that your character is constantly being a victim of racism by most muses, but it\u2019s okay for your muse to treat someone like they\u2019re shit cuz they\u2019re Japanese, black, or Mexican? So it\u2019s okay to accuse people of not wanting to ship with your muse cuz they infantize him and he\u2019s not white, only for you to constantly blow off your ships with other POC muses and constantly chase after white 6\u20194 male muses? And throw a massive gas lighting fit when they DON\u2019T want to ship with you and claim it\u2019s racism all over again?\n\nLike, fuck then dude. It\u2019s no wonder that people eventually leave them. And I would like to clarify this person is in a MUCH older range. They are not a teenager or even mid twenties.",

            "selftext": "In my other post I said I dreaded group rps. This is not because people didn't have the time. That's not what happened by any stretch. It began nice, and eventually I just began to slowly despise it over time. \n\nLet me begin, first I joined character was introduced and I got started. The cracks began to show a tiny bit when the host only would show up, not to guide the rp theme or storyline but to debate who was best Canon character and why they would ship their oc with their favorite Canon. Listen, I don't mind if you find it fun, you do you, it doesn't harm me if you ship your oc with a Canon. What does however if you spam the main chat with it. But thats not the worst of it, I will get to it later. \n\nThen we had one person who was absolutely cracked with their oc, bloodcode and abilities. As in, it's not balance. He just has a better phone instead of a better gaming chair cling to their favorite Canon, rping the main story of the game and that was not being rped. \n\nThen we had someone else simping hard for drama, they introduce BBEG. BBEG gets beaten but not for good no. Instead they return and do the same thing not once, not twice but 7 times a week if possible. \n\nWhich brings me to the next point. We had one person seeking attention so much they began to turn their character into a fetch quest object we have to pick up 7 times a week and it was not like she learned either. It was 7 times a week and if possible 4 times a month repeating. \n\nThis is where I met the best villain ever in this chat but alas, he was in this chat and his time to truly shine never came. \n\nThen we had someone who auto hits rp fights and then because they auto hit they could control said oc as well. Yes you heard me right. When someone tried to resist they said they can't. She controls them now and they have to oblige. \n\nThen this same person when the rp fight was already a big mess decided to control ocs mid fight, Half a world away as well with said auto hits. I was not pleased since it was already hard to follow, we had to make a rule especially for them that they cannot do that. \n\nThen you introduce a BBEG yourself and you like to make them strong. Enough to resist 3 ocs at least. Rival their strength and...okay none of that will happen. Instead 10 people want to be the hero of the day and instead of being realistic you have to turn your BBEG into a ff14 online raid boss. \n\nCharacter arcs by the person who used the team rocket like villain 7 times a week, 4 times a month became repetitive. It was literally *Oc walks* for 2 weeks and they wanted to continue this for 2 more weeks until we were absolutely bored to death. You could not do anything else because everyone followed them.\n\nThe host, who almost never showed up, came in from time to time. If she did not like you, she would ignore you with her oc. Like you don't exist. After 3 times no one wanted to rp with her because she was so picky, and then complained she had no one to interact with. I am sorry, but you showed everyone in the chat that you are pretty picky. Why would anyone even try. And if she was here she would start an argument. Why? Because I hate Canon characters in group rps for a reason and here's why. Some people gave their own twist. Fine but where it becomes iffy is that if you make your own Canon. Someone else who uses said character as well can bump. And this is what happened. They kept arguing the sexuality with the person who auto hits and controls oc's \n\nAnd the story that is well known is the forcing of romance and interaction locking. Someone locks an oc by speaking to them and then leaving. It would be nice to wait. Instead that got abused as well to the point I said screw the 24 hour rule. This was absolutely on purpose. \n\nAnd lastly, no meaningful interaction. BBEG gets beaten and 10 minutes later you have a different reskin in front of you. Ocs had no time to bond, if you tried they would literally disrupt it and it became so annoying I just left.\n\nThe only reason I stayed was because my friend, who I had a good time with rp wise was in it. I met another friend in that period who joined and they saw no fun in it either. I said to my female friend I could not enjoy it anymore. I get things promised and I only wanted one thing, meaningful interaction and I couldn't even get that without that same person disrupting it with a BBEG. I have no regret leaving and I am glad I did. It was toxic, tedious, annoying, and above all. I didn't want to rp like this. \n\nHence I never tried to join a group ever again until a week ago. I joined some but I just lost interest in it because of that experience. \n\nThis is my story and unfortunately I could not make it more positive. I just loathed it. Thinking back I just felt like time was wasted trying to make it work",

            "selftext": "I hate when I put out a role-play request for something specific. For example a Rainbow 6 Siege role-play, or something. Someone will message me with a basic. \u201cHey, I\u2019m interested.\u201d \u2014 no further information added as in what character they\u2019d be or their own oc, etc. So I have to be the one asking the questions. But then the last minute they say. \u201cOh, by the way I don\u2019t know the game but I still want to role-play it.\u201d\n\n????? I have to explain it to them. They give me a character sheet who is not fitted for the role-play.  And I\u2019m also the only one starting a plot/starter. I would ask for them to contribute and ask to of course help discuss with me so we are both on the same side and intrigued. But, it\u2019s like some damn school project to them. They don\u2019t want to do any sort of the work, any of their input or interests. It is so annoying. Yet they get surprised and become angry at me when I have to say I am not interested. Because my god is it exhausting being the only one invested and adding my own ideas, basically doing all the work on my own.\n\nAnother thing to add is in general with my type of genres I do for role-play, which I always add when requesting.  (Crime/Action/Romance/Combat/etc) even games like Rainbow Six as I will use again for example. The person is not experienced at all with either of the list and especially about shooter games. Zero knowledge on how to write it. Like what was the point of messaging me??? They become so timid of it and just want to skip to romance and a happy ending without tense,  scary fighting scenes . \ud83d\ude44 - which is of course my main genre, it\u2019s what I love to write and, again, I always tell them that and they say. \u201cSure, no worries.\u201d Yet they cannot handle it. Romance and smut can bore me easily. I would not say no to it and will accept it into a role-play, but not straight away and every paragraph after. Like please let our characters develop, they will be strangers starting out or acquaintance.  No need to rush. Let my character be free for a bit.\n\nAll in all why do people message despite not knowing the fandom, or not knowing how to write crime/action/combat stuff, or simply not interested into what I specifically requested and want to do yet will still agree. It is beyond frustrating.\n\nAnyone else have this problem with role-play partners? Similar or not.",

            "selftext": "Today a guy cones in to the group server, he claims to be an adult and he wrote and typed like one so I don't think it was a kid but you never really know. This is really specific so if he's on here he'll probably know it's him but oh well. \n\nHe immediately starts trying to make a charater. We have a little verification process, it's not invasive just things like age and writing sample. (There's a maximum and minimum age so we just try to make sure people read that.) We tell him to do it and he does. Then tries to use the charater from his writing sample. Ok whatever, he does it wrong but we help him fix it. ( he also doesn't wait for us to approve the character before he starts trying to get a partner which is a nitpick but it annoyed me.) \n\nNow I know not every server does this but one thing we like are having face claims of what our characters looked like as kids. Since there's a really extensive timeline it's good to have a visual of what they looked like during a turning point for their futures. It's not at all mandatory and the server is sfw so it's just a little quirk. This guy decides to do it too, awesome! Except that the child is a young Hitler. This is immediately noticed by an admin who tells the rest and asks him about it. \n\nAt first he makes out like he just couldn't possibly find anything else. Nothing looks like his charater. I mean he didn't even have to do one in first place. To be honest we were all making jokes at that point because it was really stupid. Then everything completely took a turn it was already bad, but after he said, \"You know my character actually shares a lot of traits with Hitler the face claim is fitting.\" We lost our minds. What can you possibly say to that? His ranting didn't stop. We found it so shockingly hilarious that we let him go on. No one could believe a person this dumb existed. His points, \n\n*1. I should be allowed to use Hitler as a face claim because it's artistic expression. If the face claim makes you uncomfortable then I'm doing a good job. If I can't use Hitler as a face claim or something else to make people uncomfortable writing just becomes boring.*\n\nNo. Hitler is not an artistic choice.\n\n*2. World War 2 roleplay servers let me do it.\" \n\n*3. I know more about the Holocaust than the Jewish person in the group, so the Jewish person is a 'chud' who should not be talking about how Hitler makes him uncomfortable.*\n\n*4. You can't call me stupid because I have an IQ of 75.*\n\n*5. You're all racist because you didn't assume I was white.*\n\n*6. Being black is a choice.*\n\nNot really sure how he moved on to talking about black people. But he was immediately banned following that comment. \n\nYou just cannot make this stuff up. And normally I would think it was a troll But he sounded so hurt that we weren't going to let him roll play Baby Hitler! Like he was genuinely getting offended. Hopefully it was just a troll but my goodness it was ridiculous.",

This **always** seems to happen.\n\nBit of preface: \n\nI know exactly what I\u2019m looking for with plenty of options to vary things up and offer a bit of a better experience for those I\u2019m writing with. I always offer to do something they want to do as well if they aren\u2019t particularly interested in what I am. A fair trade a feel. And before you saying anything *no* I\u2019m not the type to favor one story over the other when it comes to doubles. I\u2019ve been known to offer multiple ships in a story and keep everything fair. That\u2019s why I love this hobby, it allows me to test what I\u2019m capable of.\n\nThat was the bread, this is the bologna:\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been posting an ad, and bumping threads for the better part of a month. Knowing exactly what I want and putting what I can offer. This has gotten a few hits, most, like usual, fall by the wayside two posts in. It\u2019s whatever, in used to that crap by now. Come today I actually met two people, \u2018A\u2019 from here who offered up a new fandom that I eagerly checked out and agreed to write from them while they agreed to help me scratch my creative itch. Another reached out as well, roughly about the same time(mind you I was in the middle of a movie so I could accurately portray what \u2018A\u2019 was looking for) and \u2018B\u2019 dropped a message.\n\nNot 45 minutes later I went to respond to \u2018B\u2019 and I got greeted by \u201cdeleteduser#1234\u201d. I was more confused then anything but since when did not responding to someone\u2019s introductory message a cause for a block? Like, can I at least get a chance to see what your full message was? I\u2019ll never understand what this hobby has become I\u2019m just trying to exist in its world. Thankfully I offer this once in awhile rant to people who I feel are in the same boat as me.\n\nTLDR:\n\nOld man yells at wall.",

            "selftext": "**Good evening! I don't know what it really is called, but its where you have your partner solve puzzles and get their characters into bad pit holes they have to climb out of that the villain has created. So many apologies if the title is misleading!**  \n\n\n**Anyways, my partner sort of wants to plunder through everything and get the results** ***right now*** **instead of solving the puzzle/quest. While I do slack and allow them to get through some things, others I can not do due to that certain event triggers the overarching event that summons the BBEG. This ends up causing my partner to give up on the quest instead of solving it (after I drop several clues or even have a character tell them how to solve it if they are truly stumped). This partner also is the same one (if you seen my post weeks ago) that stops the RP as soon as it is time for me to play a bottom character.**  \n\n\n**Due to their lack of interest, and me still wanting to please, I was thinking someone could offer me advice or ideas on how to create interesting quests that could work with someone with these two disorders. After we had agreed to fade to black after we talked our last issue out, I worry they shall stop the RP now due to me making bad quests/villains that they need to defeat.**  \n\n\nHere is some of my past villains/quests that I allowed my partner to experience, though we didn't get through half of them since they stopped as soon as it was my turn to play a bottom character (as I do sprinkle sex for the fun time between each plot point):  \n1.) (Ancient Japan RP) I was going to have bandits intercept her characters. There would be a fight, and these bandits would either have her characters live or die (though she has full control to allow them to die or not. I always ask in advance without saying the reason why). These bandits are just people looking to survive while Japan is in another war, so they have no choice in what they are doing for survival. After they get captured, we send them to a foreigner's ship as the bandits think they could get easy money. Depending on how their characters react, either-&gt;  \na.) the characters are going to be stuck on a ship and have to find a way out of it before they set sail.  \nb.) the Foreigners pull a dirty move on the bandits, causing the characters to have a choice to either help the bandits or sneak away before they end up being diced meat.  \n\n\n2.) (Mafia boss x mechanic RP) The mafia boss that is a friend of the lover of her character kidnaps their character to get back at his friend for doing him dirty. He goes to ship him out of state to be part of the human trafficking ring, but the plane ends up crashing. There is some villainous survivors among the lot, and her character has to not only survive in the woods, but also has to pick out who to trust.  \n\n\n3.) (Fantasy RP-*This one we did complete, but she hated it as I killed her favorite character that I played*. \\[TW: This does include religion, so may be a touchy subject for some. Also a miscarriage occurs too\\]. Hell starts going into chaos after the King and new Queen of Hell gets poisoned. Her character, who is the son of the King, has to find who poisoned his father and find a cure. Two archangels were the culprits, who are attempting to kill the King and Queen since the King of Hell killed God a few months ago. Her character meets other higher level demons and humanoid deadly sins who she has to befriend to be able to kill two archangels who are more powerful than a boy that is still learning to use his magic. Since it taken so long, the King passes away due to the poison and the Queen suffers a miscarriage. Her character then has to find a way to bring his father back, as it is possible to do so (though she did miss this and ended up throwing a fit even though I said several times that there is a way to bring the character back)  \n\n\n**I don't know if I am not creating interesting enough plots she have to overcome, or if I am doing too much. So any advice is appreciated as I would like to make sure she enjoys what I throw at her. Thanks in advance!**",

Still not rushing into anything but she told me she is very smitten with my character, and she often gives me priority compared to other possible partners.\n\nWhen we both met we said how we don\u2019t want anything in real life. I still pretty much agree, it never goes well. Still, we also flirt a lot ooc now and share affection in a way that it\u2019s clearly us and not our characters. We have talked on voice and are very comfortable together. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m beginning to like her more ooc though even if I started with never wanting anything. I\u2019m afraid of getting jealous or something too.\n\nAny advice? Should I just chill and see where things go, or should I try and stop ooc stuff too to be clear? I just find myself really enjoying her company every day, and the way we flirt and comfort each other.",

            "selftext": "Dear Reddit,\n\nmaybe I'm just looking for comfort. Or for someone to tell me why they ghosted, so I can project it onto these people and feel better. I don't know, really.\n\nBut I RP to comfort myself when I need a break off real life. And because of a shitton of different factors, I have a lot of issues, including that, ghosting really triggers anxiety for me&gt;! because it reminds me of dead people, as there were cases when I found out it was the result of death; terminal illness catching up or suicide - in the latter case, I have even witnessed it in voice calls with me and that feeling of powerlessness really fucks you up.!&lt;\n\nUsually, I can wait. But sometimes, there are these people you really, really click with and then it fucking hurts when they're gone. In my case, I'm suddenly being ghosted by three people at once.\n\nNumber 1 hurts the most but I also have the most hope he'll eventually answer. It's probably just a busy time, but we met 2 years ago in a group RP on Discord and initially talked every day for almost 3 months, RPd a lot; then he lost access to his discord and we were lucky to find one another randomly again. He, too, seemed super excited and this time, I also got his e-mail to message him if he lost access again. Anyway, fast forward, we mostly send an email once a month and now it's been a couple of months since his last response. Dunno, weird but probably just busy.\n\nNumber 2 seems like we've gotten along well. After I told him that I have serious issues with ghosting, we actually get a little more into the personal territory; nothing serious, though, I don't think there was any flirting. I just tried to be friendly on the side while we RP, been going well from what I see for two weeks and now there's virtually nothing anymore. Thanks to Discord ID, I also know that this account is fairly new, so perhaps it was just a disposable. I was really happy he seemed to like the same niche stuff and would have loved to talk more about that. Also, his style was super aesthetic and I'm living for it. Considering he has issues of his own, I just hope for the best; for him, really, because I doubt he still wants to RP. I'd love to chat or at least say goodbye, though.\n\nNumber 3 ....... is just a mystery. We RPd for a night a week ago and sacrificed a night of sleep over it because we connected so well; he admitted to me to be falling asleep, which is why he asked if I wanted to continue and exchange contacts in the first place. I get messaged, I get a \"hey\" but ever since then, there's truly nothing. Not a single thing which somehow hurts me the most, so because I'm already a bit destabilised, I start just messaging him like every second day in hopes he'll reply because he seemed so eager to pick it up again and I had my hopes up. Of course, I'm met with radio silence and it's messing me up, so I begged him for \\_anything\\_. Blocking me would be nice, too, because I really just need the closure, man. I told him that for personal reasons, this messes me up, in hopes he'll react somehow because all I want is a bit of decency. Just a goodbye or something.\n\nI'd like to mention that he changed his profile pic to match his character upon friending me on Discord and that I also offered he just change it back as a reply to me. But nothing and he seems constantly invisible, so I just don't know anything.\n\nI think I really just needed to vent. With that being said, I do hope this might persuade one or two people to not ghost and just tell people what's up. I know I've accidentally ghosted in the past, but my usual mode is to attempt to reply to everyone and tell them what's up.\n\nThank you for reading my anxious thoughts, everyone.",

Regardless, that clutches my partners away from me. I am sorry, but I tend to be finicky sometimes and love to roleplay with a partner who has good grammar with a lovely narration.\nNevertheless, occasionally I appreciate her temperament more than her skills, so that's how my partner appointing goes on. \n\nNow, it's infrequent but whenever I remark something drastic like \"your narration is off today\" or \"I think, you are using pronouns repeatedly\" etc. The replies unwind to the level of none. I wonder if something is wrong with me... I am a human being, who is susceptible to mistakes too. Consequently, I would mind my partners pinpointing my shortcomings, either. That's how we would make an elegant fiction breathing through our writing.  \n\nI don't know if it's the right question to ponder upon...still, I wonder whether I need to change myself...\n\nThank you for flipping through my post!",

I am not a pedophile. In rp I'm limitless but would never do something like that to an actual child. I'm not fucking EDP445 or Glendon Cameron\n2.) I may have typed like that but it wasn't how I usually type. I usually go in detail and in depth. I have a lot of rps where i do that and could get people to back me up.\nI realized that I was also in the wrong and my posts on here were pretty much trying to play victim. So from now on I'll post ACTUAL bad rp stories. Yknow where I'm not playing victim. It's rare I come across a bad rp story but have had some issues.

            "selftext": "For starters I know people have stuff irl they gotta do, things with spouses/partners, friends, work, other obligations the typical list. This guy approached me at the tail end of February for my ad that I do still have listed, medieval fantasy, dragon prompt, etc. etc. They seemed okay at the start. I do note I have part of a world fleshed out, maybe 15% of it, 20% at most since I wanna keep it open so they can make up origins. I have stuff like part of a map, some towns specifically for my character in one area, some backstory and the dynamic I\u2019m looking for. \n\nWhat I do since I usually have my info ready to go into a server is I give some info on my girl, some world info since there\u2019s not a ton and let them work on a character, then I start the long process of moving pictures into channels and the like so I know they\u2019re committed and I\u2019m not doing this for nothing (or I do this when they actually seem excited and eager to learn about the world). \nAnyways, they seem okay for a few messages. I of course ask them what kind of dragon they were interested in, they ask if it would be a hybrid, or what type, I clarify, etc etc. They stated a gas dragon since they wanted to avoid the usual. I said it sounded like a poison or maybe like a made up sub-species of a sort but it could be a poison. It seemed different and I chuckled cause it gave me villain vibes, made me think of scar from lion king with the green back lighting and I was humming \u2018be prepared. They then didn\u2019t necessarily want to play a \u2018bad guy\u2019 but I mean\u2026it\u2019s poison so\u2026.\n Then the question comes \u2018mind helping me beautiful?\u2019 Dude..you dont know what I look like, I\u2019m over here looking like a potato gremlin with 80\u2019s/90\u2019s troll hair. \nThat\u2019s besides the point because I\u2019m rolling my eyes because they want their hand held when I\u2019ve already got my stuff good to go. I told them to just find an element they\u2019d like and work from there. It\u2019s a few days before they message again, making idle commentary about some irl stuff but nothing that can really be replied to, basically the worst small talk ever. The next few days pass with no progress on plotting and they keep sending messages after I\u2019ve told them I\u2019d likely be asleep (my phones on silent so it wasn\u2019t they were waking me, I just missed them). I was crashing early at this point, 9-10 ish and they would consistently message me at like 11-1am and I wouldn\u2019t get back to them till morning. It\u2019s now been almost  2 weeks. They send idle messages here and there asking what I\u2019m up to, I say on on facebook or TikTok..whatever. They then make comments like \u2018\u2019goddamn that facebook, why can\u2019t I have your attention?\u2019 With winky faces, teasing, which is just\u2026cringe worthy because our conversations have been very short, not much to them, and I\u2019m pretty much just waiting on them to make a character.\n \nThey then suggest a certain element I have too many of which is stated in my gdocs. I also went and showed them the map I had which isn\u2019t very fleshed out, so he could pick an area he\u2019d like, I could make a label on the map, put some symbols in and add his info to it\u2026of course that never happened. He eventually decides on a forest/jungle type dragon so I basically was like \u201cokay so nature, so probably a brown or green,cool\u201d he\u2019s making a tiny bit of progress\u2026.. He showed two pics  he sorta liked ad complained he was having issues finding images so I offered to help. I sent like 5 I found in a span of just a few minutes on Pinterest to see if anything sparked something he liked. He asks which I prefer which honestly, I don't care they\u2019re his character, they all look intriguing to some degree which is why they were sent to begin with. \nThis goes nowhere, idle messages every few days are sent just with hey, not of course no progress..I eventually make a server but dont add too much not wanting to commit when it\u2019s been weeks and he can\u2019t even select one picture when he also needs to pick a human form image and make a background. He eventually a few days ago sends some human form options he had that are full body, no warning, all smut of Artois humanoid or humans balls deep in random women/elves/demons and I know I\u2019m hitting my breaking point. He wont pick from them so I just say the first or second but again he wont commit and just vanishes again. I\u2019m fed up and leave a closing message and wait a while in hopes he read it and delete the server. He messages a while later asking why he can\u2019t find the group. I clearly state. \n\u201cI left it up for a while in hopes you\u2019d see it but stated that we aren\u2019t a good match. You approached over a month ago and we\u2019ve made no progress with characters not even being done. I appreciate you reaching out and best luck with other writing partners.\nThey respond nearly an hour later.\n\u201cI felt we made more today than the past month\u201d he sent smut, didn\u2019t even commit to the first photo and wanted me to hand hold, so my response goes as follows.\n\u201cA little, a single picture which you still weren\u2019t sure of which to use. I had my character done, I had locations ready to post, a few location backstories I fleshed out map wise for my character and her background. I don\u2019t bother setting it all up till my partners made a profile and has their pictures which on average takes a few hours to 1-3 days, or a week at maximum if they\u2019re busy. As I said, we aren\u2019t a good match when it takes that long to setup. Again, best of luck.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had no replies since that message but I get a lot like this and he\u2019s been the most cringey one in the past few months.",

Just need to vent for a second.\n\nWhen I roleplay, it seems like people never want to roleplay with me at all. There have been cases where a group RP has died and I've been the only one really active, and when the group comes back they all avoid RPing with me and RP with each other instead. I know I dug my own grave here, by roleplaying hurt/comfort too much, but it still kind of stings because they've outright stated they prefer roleplaying with the other people.\n\nAgain, this is my fault. I kind of wore everybody out on my characters. I thought I was portraying realistic consequences of torture, but to be honest, roleplaying isn't really the best medium for that. It just wore everybody out and drained their motivation. Doesn't help that we all got caught up in OOC drama as well. It frustrates me, though, because at least one of the torture scenes I wasn't actually asked about beforehand, but it shouldn't really bother me as much as it does. I feel like I got shoehorned into a very specific role and then ditched when I couldn't fill the role properly, but I also know that's just my anxiety and jealousy talking. It's not what's actually happening here.\n\nI don't know, man. I've been friends with these people for years. I dropped the roleplay, but I don't want to drop them. But it's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm only kept around to do things for them and otherwise they don't want to talk to me. Which I get; again, I'm well aware I dug my own hole here, I'm the problem in the equation, not them. I overapologize, I get too anxious, and I'm a people-pleaser; I'm just generally not very fun to be around. Still kind of sucks though.",

My problem recently is when I bring up face-claims, I'm immediately bombarded with links to pornstars with my partners begging me or downright demanding me to use one of them as my characters appearance and honestly I can't help but feel like they are just using innocent unsuspecting people in their sexual fantasies about fucking and being with said pornstars. I really didn't think this was something I'd run into, yet here I am. Has anyone else ran into this? I straight up told someone I wasn't going to use a legit pornstar as my character's appearance and I'd appreciate it if they didn't send me porn again they played the pity card about how no one wants to give them what they want and that this roleplay probably wouldn't work out because I'm so unwilling and not open minded. Like..??\n\nI'm gonna have to start putting 'NO PORNSTAR FACE-CLAIMS/DONT SEND ME PORN' in my requests because what the fuck?",

            "selftext": "Lets start with a bit of backstory: Most of my RP with done on Secondlife with my wife (both OOC and IC) who is bed ridden and uses it as a way to escape her issues for a bit. I run a small PMC group that honestly just winds up doing security or SWAT type work mostly and rarely pulls out any of the big toys, i started this 'PMC' after getting fed up with how most police departments seemed to be ran by dictators or DB's (usually both) so i created my own little group to service whatever community wanted us and set it up so even the lowest private has a say and we also try to help our community to the best of our ability. Got a better plan than me? Sure go for it, you're taking point on this operation then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto the meat of the story: This was about 5 or 6 years back and my group had just moved into a new town. We were all happy to be back to work again after the last community fell apart and had been drifting for a month or two now. We move into town and everyone is happy to have us about, even the police as they were short staffed as all get out. So we set about both in RP and OOC with the community owners and police talking it over and get to an agreement that our team will handle SWAT style stuff and leave the normal policing to the police unless none are available at that time but then the report has to be handed in to be double checked. Fair enough, all is well except...there is no space for an office. Okay, thats fine. Me and my wife find a big house as we had IC kids too and pay for a month on it to get started, (for those who don't know Secondlife, alot of RP sims have housing but you have to pay rent for it. This helps relieve the strain of 83 USD a week on the owners heads) and i start running my squad out of my garage. All is great until we meet the Fire Chief. ( FC from here on) Now FC was good at his job handling the equipment and required busy work quite well but there was a problem, in the form of one major superiority complex i could tell right from the start. Okay fine, i can deal with AHats. Until our first fire in town after i came about. Right away things start going to hell fast, FC is running about screaming at everyone! Trying to tell police how to do their jobs, trying to order my guys about (one of which was off duty and was standing there with a glass of whiskey watching as there honestly was nothing this new recruit could do) and being a general jerk. After this we find this isn't also just an IC problem, FC seriously even acts like this OOC! This goes on for a few weeks until he starts randomly booting my cars for being parked on the side street by my house which was allowed in the first place and in the second place...why is the fire department booting cars? Well by this time the community both IC and OOC had enough so me and the guys came up with an idea...though this required going rogue a bit. We meet and were trying to figure out how to get some revenge on this guy and one of the privates pipes up that he noticed the fire hydrants can be shot off or ran over to break them. They respawn after a minute but any hose connection will be lost and need to be totally reset. Little did any of us notice the head of police had just came over to the house to see how things were going and approve some new weapon permits and overhears this. Oh crap right? Nope, he's sick of FC's crap both IC and OOC and is fully in on the plan. So we scheme to wait a week as the person who owned the fire hydrants in town was about to leave on a vacation for a month to go overseas to see family. These hydrants have two modes, breakable and non-breakable and only the owner can change it. Now the action: After the lady who owned the hydrants left, for the next month there is a fire every day in town. And where are my guys? Laying prone on rooftops almost across town with long range rifles in hand and positioned to see the fire hydrants the FD are using. Sometimes multiple guys working together on different buildings. That month no hose stayed attached to a hydrant longer than a minute and FC is too dumb to figure out what is happening even when one of his guys said he heard a bullet impact and a gunshot. Fires that used to take 15 minutes suddenly took 2 hours. All the while FC is screaming on OOC that he does not have time for this stuff and someone needs to fix it. And for anyone who called saying they heard gunshots? Police already knew and would 'handle it'. Eventually one of the owners took notice of what we were doing while observing ongoing RP and he's in our box laughing. Apparently the owners were about to ban him but they decided that what we were doing was far more entertaining and to keep it up. By the end of the month the criminals had decided to join in with the hydrant popping with guns and cars (of course FAR less subtle than the way we had been doing it) and this was the last straw for FC. He couldn't keep a hose attached for more than 5 seconds! He screamed some incoherent babble in chat and just left the server. Never heard from him again. We got a new chief 3 days later and all went swimmingly till the community shut down a few months later. I don't generally pay my guys outside of RP as its well RP and i shouldn't need to, but everyone who participated got a few bucks from me to go grab a few beers and come back and we spent the whole night partying back at my house.",
