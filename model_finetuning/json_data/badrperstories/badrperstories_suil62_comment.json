            "body": "It's just another form of sexual predation and grooming. It happens everywhere, not unique to RP spaces.\n\nI am reminded of one of many RPs like this. I had a dude, he later revealed himself underage (15). I was ... 29? I think? Obviously, I wanted no ERP, no romance, absolutely not. I suggested that his OC and mine could be friends instead. But every time I tried to RP with him, his OC would get flirty with mine. Eventually I suggested a public RP, he agreed. When he inevitably got pushy, my OC started kicking his ass. It was worth a good laugh for myself and my followers. \n\nAnother time, a RP was arranged between myself and someone who'd been following my fanfiction. We plotted an eventual ERP, but I was quite clear that I wanted it to flow naturally and focus on plot and character development. He got flirty almost immediately. I mean sure, some characters are flirtacious, but it felt very inorganic. Like, out of character, made no sense in the plot, that sort of thing. I found myself not wanting to update the RP, and instead focused on other RPs. Ohhhh, nooooo, I couldn't do that, he owns me now, apparently? He got super pissy, eventually flooded my inbox with this essay-length rant. Possessive, much? He is one of many reasons I don't ERP anymore.",

I'm sorry that happened to you! :/ \n\nI've been role-playing for quite a long time, so I have a few standout examples of partners who crossed serious boundaries with me. I recall one distinct experience where I had written an intro to set up our characters' first meeting, and what I got in response was a *monstrously* long reply that described their meeting, and then them going to their character's house, an entire house tour, dinner, and an entire sex scene. Now, granted, these were all elements that we had agreed upon prior, but like... I wanted to actually play them out. It was bizarre. I still have that roleplay saved somewhere because it was such an odd experience. \n\nHonestly, though, what's even worse in my opinion is people lying about their ages\u2013 I had that happen to me *a lot* when I was younger and had a really bad habit of getting *too* attached to people and their problems (it was the sort of special personality defect that makes you compulsively want to save *everyone* from their problems). I'd form these complex online friendships with what I thought was a real person and then have it be revealed to me that the gay college student I had been speaking to this entire time was in actuality a 16 year old girl from the rural south or something. But I was young and stupid and this wasn't a deal breaker for me, which turned out to be a horribly bad decision in the long run every single time.",

I had gotten the role as Bakugo, and someone else in the server (who claimed to be 16) got Kirishima. We had both DMed back and forth pretty often, and we came to the conclusion that we'd do sort of fluff since we weren't old enough to do NSFW.  \n\n\nWe did this whole plot point of them hanging out in Bakugo's dorm for this first time, and the tension between friendship and bromance. I wasn't looking to do a full on romantic roleplay. \n\nOut of nowhere, this person just starts making this scenario of Kirishima being EXTREMELY sexual with Bakugo. Of course, I was feeling hella uncomfy. I reported him to the mods, and they did a deep dive on who this dude actually was.

Bc if i find out they are underage and lying? Lets just say Ive been blocking people faster than Han Solo shooting first. Because it is illegal and both can get into serious trouble. But yet these people give me the ol \u201cits okay its just rp\u201d / \u201ci won\u2019t mind/ say anything.\u201d / \u201cive done it before.\u201d / \u201ci like rping with older people.\u201d \u201cI like older girls\u201d. / \u201cits only rp. Its not that serious. I am mature for my age.\u201d Those are red flags for me, seeing as i am an adult. 18+ is fine but honestly im beginning to say older than 18 or 21+ only, because i just can\u2019t deal w/ younglings wanting to rp with me. Especially when it comes to mature topics or nsfw. They just can\u2019t understand the fact that its illegal.",
