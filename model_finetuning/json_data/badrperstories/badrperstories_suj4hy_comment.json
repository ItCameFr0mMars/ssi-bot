            "body": "Thank you for the response. I've been mulling over how to word it without upsetting her because there's a couple of other plots in the rp that other people have with her. If she gets annoyed over this, it would affect them too. I've considered telling them before, as a headsup that I'll be having a chat with her. When I told one of them that it wasn't sitting right with me when she volunteered me for scenes that won't suit MC, they seemed to shrug it off. So I started wondering if it was normal to do that. Maybe I was the one being protective of MC. It could be that I'm just building it up and worrying too much. I think I'll word it like you suggested and let the pieces fall wherever.",

I.e., \"when x happens, it makes me feel y.\"\n\nWith that said, I wouldn't be overly polite about it, either. Being too nice is often a signal for others that it's totally cool to keep overstepping your boundaries (because, again, you're being incredibly nice about it), or the point just does not go through for them all the way. I would be kind, but firm. If this winds up upsetting her, then she's never going to respect your boundaries and you're better off without her. Most people don't throw a tantrum or take it personally when someone asks them to stop doing something that makes them uncomfortable.",
