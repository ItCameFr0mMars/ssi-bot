It often feels like both people are forcing themselves to write one role that they don't really want to write, and it often ends in a disaster. Yes, some people are reasonable about it, but others are just like 'This means that your male character has to embody my perfect romantic fantasy and maybe if you're lucky, I will begrudgingly write a male character for you. But most of the time, we'll only focus on my female character and your male. Oh, here are 100 details I want you to keep in mind about my perfect love interest.' \n\nI met so many people who would just be like 'Okay, so I noticed (her female character) and (my male character) are just soo much more interesting, the roleplay is going so well, this is the only part that interests me, let's drop the other couple.' or use excuses like 'Well, I just don't have any ideas for them.'\n\nThey get really involved in their favourite part of the story, throw a fit when you don't answer immediately, and are incredibly pushy. Often, they really seem to have the opinion that the whole roleplay was perfect so they just don't want to let go, despite not putting in any effort on their part.\n\nI also think that ghosting was justified, because this person has already shown you that they don't care for you as a partner and don't take 'no' for an answer.",

            "body": "for me personally, it\u2019s weird to let someone else choose my fc. i get how for some roleplayers the fc is no big deal, and it really isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s still part of character creation and helps the character come to life and feel more like yours. saddling someone with playing a male character when they aren\u2019t comfortable doing it is bad enough, but dictating how they should play that character is a recipe for disaster. because you weren\u2019t comfortable, you should have been given the room and ability to create your OWN male character - and only if you WANTED to try it in the first place. \n\na lot of the rp community seems to be people searching for someone to write out their fantasies. which, fine, i get that\u2019s what rp is to a degree, but when it\u2019s blatantly one sided like that it\u2019s\u2026 awkward. especially if it seems like you\u2019re fulfilling a sexual fantasy. i can\u2019t help but think that when people have a ready made fc for you to use. why does it matter what the characters look like, really, or why do they have to be this specific person? idk.",
