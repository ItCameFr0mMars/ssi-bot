It's a horrible thing that sadly people do go through, and fetishizing it is just really uncomfortable. It's one of my few limits. And yeah, people who say that \"Men can't be sexually harassed/raped\" are disgusting. Not just disgusting but just, like, objectively wrong.

Sexual assault survivors developing non con kinks isn\u2019t all that uncommon. Does every single one or even the majority? No, but it does happen and it\u2019s not right or wrong. \n\nIt isn\u2019t your kink, that\u2019s fair but as long as it\u2019s clearly understood that it\u2019s fantasy and consensual non consent, no harm no foul and kink shaming isn\u2019t cool.",

            "body": "Hi, yes, as someone whose dealt with this fantasy thank you for shedding light on this subject. CNC definitely isn't uncommon for SA victims and women. I've heard discussions of it being a product of internalized sexism, but this is indeed a harmless fantasy and the people who deal with this know the difference between the fantasy and reality. They don't actually want to be taken advantage of. \n\nWhile the morality of CNC is very ambiguous, generally speaking, the overall hostility you see isn't typically towards the people who want to be taken advantage of (although they too face their fair share scrutiny), but those who want to take advantage. Typically, we associate men with wanting the latter.\n\n I think people's understanding of this kink is heavily dictated by gender. To an extent, CNC is normalized for women, but people are less likely to be sympathetic toward men. Why? The lines are *very, very* blurred for men. Especially in this hobby, many women won't roleplay with men (including me admittedly) because we've come to associate it as being a risk.  \n\nToxic masculinity, Incel culture, etc. are also still fairly prevalent issues. So, just thought I'd throw my two cents in!",
