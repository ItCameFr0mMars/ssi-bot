Here's the thing: it's gonna show eventually that you don't like it if you keep this up and that becomes being passive aggressive. That's not gonna be fun for anyone eventually. \n\nYou have options. You can talk to them about it. \"Hey I know you really like this character but I feel we're getting really off track from the plot we planned. I think we should work out a compromise.\" Something like that.\n\nYou could help create a plot with your partner for this character to work in. Personally, when someone in the group really loves a character, I want to be able to love that character too and give them a setting they can thrive equally in with other characters. It doesn't feel good being sidelined after all. The issue is that you're finding that this character is being shoehorned just about everywhere; find a space where this character can be a focus so that the main plot can have its own focus.",

They kept trying to sort of force a relationship with their side character onto my main and the side character was a bit of a whiney elitist arrogant archetype who will I enjoy having one in the story I had no intentions of ever pairing with my lead female. Frank discussions were had over the issue but at the end of the day the rp fizzled out after because I think they just wanted to pair their oc with a canon female instead of my oc and was treating everything my oc was in as unimportant when it came to where their main character was involved. So having a conversation may not fix things but it\u2019s better than just stewing on your feelings and having your character become potentially uncharacteristically snippy / bitchy in rp as a result.",
