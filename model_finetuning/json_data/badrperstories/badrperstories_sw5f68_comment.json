Which is also why I generally put a lot of work and thought into it whenever I approach someone to RP - sure there've been ghosters and bad matchups, but I find that more often than not I find my efforts rewarded. I generally find that if I put in the effort into 2-3 people I click with, it overall comes down to less emotional drain than planning 6 concurrent RPs I don't really care about.

            "body": "I'm not okay with smut now, but I used to be when I was young. I was one of these people who was okay with it.  I would be more excited about the story over all.  Smut never really interested me any more or less than any other kind of scene within that story.  I could write it and love the rp, but I could also leave it out entirely and enjoy the rp just as much.  I never did anything where smut was anything more than a small part of a larger non-smutty story, though.\n\nI don't think it's petty.  I do think it might be putting words in people's mouths because \"I'm okay with smut\" doesn't necessarily translate to \"I don't like smut, but I'll do it.\"  Some people tend to take a more professional tone when they're setting up a new roleplay which sometimes reads as a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nBut this is largely just another instance where people aren't compatible with each other.  There's nothing wrong with you being enthusiastic about smut specifically and there's nothing wrong with people being kind of 'meh' about it.  They just don't mix well.  It does really suck when you're trying to find people you mesh with and keep running into the same problem, though.  I hope you find the kind of enthusiastic partners you want soon.",
