Add in the excitement of knowing something fun is on the horizon, and surprises become really positive additions to a good roleplay.\n\nAt worst, one of us could surprise the other in a disappointing way. If that's the case, it's easy to say, \"That's interesting, but I don't think it fits. Can we try \\_\\_\\_ instead?\" A good partner will step back, brainstorm with you, and approach the original surprise in a different way. \n\nDon't be afraid to speak up, and don't forget to be respectful. You both have great ideas and you *can* shape a story that'll make you both happy. The most common mistake is bad communication.",
