The main character I enjoy writing is cold and emotionless, and I found that a lot of writers used his internal monologue (aka my describing his thoughts and feelings) to sort of godmod - they'd have their characters knowing and understanding what he's thinking about or feeling like, despite his never expressing his thoughts or feelings outwardly.\n\nMy solution was to just stop writing his internal monologue. It was hard at first but, all in all, it's a fun challenge and I find that it helped me improve my writing a lot. I find now that doing more show than tell makes the dialog that much more realistic, and helps my character be misunderstood in moments where I want him to be misunderstood.",

            "body": "Kind of a hand wave answer I'll admit but I'd suggest finding fictional characters or real life people that resemble what you want to portray and study them. Like someone else pointed out emotions are still there, it's just usually about how the character carries themselves. In a more direct and opinioned answer, characters are often stoic and or less emotional due to duty, experience, or upbringing and possibly nessecity. A good king must act with reason and logic because surrendering to emotions may negatively impact the people he rules. A soldier is trained to subdue emotion because it can get them killed, and some cultures simply can view certain emotions as weaknesses, bringing their people to think that way. Just remember, it's not the lack of but how it influences the character.",
