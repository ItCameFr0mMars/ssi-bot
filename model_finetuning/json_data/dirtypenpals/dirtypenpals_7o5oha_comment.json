I too get online once in a while to find the taste of the forbidden fruit, the adrenaline, the thrill of cheating ever since I stumbled over a horny army chick online who talked me into phone sex while the both of us were spoken for. That rush! That beating of my heart, just because it was forbidden, because we both risked our relationships for a steamy conversation with a stranger. It is addictive.\n\nAnd every year the speech \"no more!\". And more it is. Until that one day. Always that one day. The day I feel like paying more attention to my hair, my stubble, the way my shirt is tucked into the jeans or not tucked into the jeans. The day I shave my privates very slowly and with focus. The day I leave the house and feel like I am on the hunt, not knowing for what until I see a shy smile, a pair of lingering eyes scanning me, female curves that beg to be touched, caressed, held, admired and kissed. Women, smelling, seeing, feeling that I am ready. Ready to forget about sacred vows and promises - no. Not ready to forget, not willing to ignore but intending to break them without telling. Willing to risk it all for the intense lust that comes with tasting somebody new and forbidden. Does she know I have a fiancee? Does she know I find her so intoxicating I want to feel her, please her, fuck her although it could have such dire consequences? God I hope so.\nDoes she have a partner too? I hope she is married, I want her to risk it too, want to feel: yes, I am so hot, she wants me this much, we are both reduced to just this one twin thought of seduction and sex. What a boost for my ego, what a thrill.\n\nOn days like these, I will forget about my resolutions, will go online and be the alpha male on the prowl or the male slut I want to be that day.\n\nIt's addictive, isn't it?",
