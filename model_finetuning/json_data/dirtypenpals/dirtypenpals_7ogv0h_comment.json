Oh god the torment of feeling the stirring of being turned on and knowing this is my daughters room.\nWow maybe that shower will help me get my thoughts straight.\nI go to the bedroom and get ready for my shower, then head to he bathroom and swing the door behind me not noticing that it didn't close fully.\n\nAs I climb into the hot shower the room fills with steam, I grab the body wash and start cleaning myself as usual. But this time as I get closer to my penis and balls I feel an unusual stirring that doesn't usually happen as much as I would like.\n\nIs it from seeing her or the sounds of the porn you where watching? What was that was it the door creaking? As I look was it open that much before? \n\nOh god the feeling of the squeezing and slippery soap and my hand moving up and down, faster and faster.",

I take a step toward you but I try to stop myself thinking you're my step-daughter. I can' t resist. I take another step. And another. Until I'm close enough to notice me.\nI startled you. You try to hide yourself. You put one arm over your large breast and your other hand over your pussy. You have a startled look on your face mix with shame.\nI lean down close to you. My eyes are close to your eyes. I look at you and smile. My mouth is close to your mouth. You can feel my breath. I pick you up in my arms.\nI walk toward your bed. I gently lay you down. I stand up and look at your naked body. Your top hanging just above your breast. Your nipples pointing up to the sky. The curve of your hips. You're so beautiful.\nI can tell you want to do something wrong. I can see a mixture of guilt and excitement in your eyes. You put your hands above your head and arch your back a little bit. Just as if your begging me to finish what you started.\nI smile. I lean down and kiss your cheek. I put my and on your hip. I kiss your neck. I kiss you nipple. I suck a little bit on it. I take your breast in my hand and start sucking a little bit harder.\nI move down and start kissing down your belly.",

I'm no expert so your experiences may vary.\n\nTypically if someone writes something for this subreddit, they are looking for a private message. I'm sure there's some users that may respond well to the comments but the focus is mainly private messaging. \n\nAfter actually reading your post, it seems like you played the 'come to me' card. I can't tell you for sure what OP was looking for but she literally left you standing at the door to her character's bedroom. I bet she wants you to come and get her. Walking away kills the intensity. If watching is your thing, even stand at the door and keep *doing your thing*. But don't walk away. ",
