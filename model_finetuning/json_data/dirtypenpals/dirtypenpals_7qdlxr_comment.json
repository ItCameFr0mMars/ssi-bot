I want to save my fellow, serious, roleplayers their time; don't waste it here.\n\nHaving my wall of text being answered by one line text of \"i am wearing *this* and *that*\" followed by \"i can take off *this*\" while completely ignoring the content of the PM and the RP... well, it's just frustrating.\n\nI get it, such kind of interaction is appealing for some people but for me that was a complete and utter waste of time that I would have rather spent writing for someone else who cared.\n\nSorry for this negativity. I'm out for now.\n\n*Edit:* For clarity, the reply about wearing certain piece of clothing was not even related to the RP. It was OP telling me what she was wearing for real. It came out of nowhere and it was right after my large PM.\n\n@girls who might not see where I am coming from, see it like this: You find a prompt that really rubs you the right way, you start writing and pouring yourself in what you write. Half hour later you hit the send button, hoping to read something beautiful in return. 2 minutes later you get a dick pic.",

Online harassment is a real thing and women have to take what measures they're comfortable with to counter it.\n\nreddit has a very, very handy 'block user' button that eliminates that threat entirely. If someone is continuing to message, block them. It's really, really that easy.\n\nThe number of weirdos is considerably lower than the number of normal people that would be absolutely content with a copypasted rejection message.\n\nI agree with the rest of your points, just not this one. I'm not saying to message every single person back, but if you start a conversation with someone, the *least* that can be done is to tell them that you lost interest, especially if the message chain is 15 or 20 messages long.",

However, as someone who was seriously considering taking a large chunk of time to craft a thought-out response, it\u2019s good to know when to look elsewhere.\n\nI also want to say that I too sympathise with the frustrations of both posting and responding here as a guy. I never blame others but it does get very disheartening when you spend an hour or more crafting a multi paragraph response tailored to that individual, only to never even know if your effort was read. And to be clear, I\u2019d be totally cool with people telling me they\u2019re not interested or that some things didn\u2019t hit the mark. Please, tell me what I did right and wrong. It\u2019s the only way I can improve as a writer and I strive to improve.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be exaggerating to say that I\u2019m lucky to get one reply to every 10 posts I respond to. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the girls at least have the advantage when it comes to quantity of feedback.",

If the OP had just not responded to the guy who called her out, she would have avoided the embarrassment of being publicly called out. So yes, silence would have been the best option for her. And as long as there are a significant number of guys who will lose their shit when they get a polite message turning them down or breaking things off, silence is always going to be the best option. Yes, you can block people, but why take the risk of getting even one needy/whiny/ranty/whatever message when you can just ghost and avoid that entirely?\n\nYes, ghosting is bad etiquette.
