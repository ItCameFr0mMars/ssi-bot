Either she hasn't checked her PMs yet, but your reddit comment will remind her to... check reddit, via reddit? Chances are if she sees your comment, she sees the orange letter, bro.. Or she has, and she didn't care to respond, making your comment worthless.\n\nSo, the practical measures of the reminder are fairly moot. Instead, are you trying to come off as endearing by publicly showing your interest? Maybe 'you' charm is just that infectious. However, the reason I suspect is to openly 'plant a flag' in the comments of the post.\n\n\"Don't bother, lads. I've already sent her a great scene!\" seems to be the ambition, here. I can only imagine how *appreciative* she must be to have such a gentleman ward off attention to an ad. Unless the entire point of an advert post in DPP is to garner attention.\n\nI do wish you luck, though. I'm sure no malice or conscious efforts to dissuade others were involved. Just be aware that this kinda comment doesn't often reflect highly on yourself.",
