In my opinion, I don't care if my partner IRL is an iguana on a keyboard. As long as they write a fun story with appealing characters I'll have a good time.

I have always in life considered myself a straight male. However as I've explored my sexuality through dpp and other fantasies I've come to terms with being much more \"open minded\" than I ever thought I would have been. For example I have actually developed a pretty big kink for fully transitioned M2F trans women. And in those fantasies I love acknowledging that what is now a woman once was a man.\n\nWhen I am role-playing or just talming dirty or whatever the case may be I am very detailed oriented. Describing not only parts of my body but my partners. And as such my sexuality does not include attraction to or enjoyment when my partner has a cock. So traps or tgirls or what have you... If my partner is an exceptional example of a woman but has a penis... I do lose some if not all  interest. Because I love pussy just as much as I love tits and was and other womanly features. I love to go down IRL and in RP but in neither of those do I want to be interacting with a cock. \n\nAfter reading your prompt I do look back and think of the times I did do the \"well I'm straight but...\" Kind of lines. And I can definitely see that they might make any potential partners uncomfortable. And from here on out I will at all costs avoid such awkward messages.\n\nHowever I can say when I did send them at least part of my reasoning in doing so was in hopes of clarifying the situation itself. If I come across a T4M post they don't always clarify if that's the IRL scenario or just in RP and even then it comes down to what are our characters? Because I have no problem if you're stroking your cock in real life as long as your character is cockfree. If youre looking to play a scene as a woman who happens to have a cock I'd like to know that ahead of time so that I won't waste either of our time because I'm not interested in other cocks. Just like I don't assume that in that T4M scenario the M wouldn't be a man with a vagina. But then maybe I'm assuming too much?\n\n\nSo yeah. I'm not trying to be ruse just trying to educate myself and anyone else who might be interested in these types of axenes but not really know how to initiate properly?\n\nHopefully I don't get ridiculed too harshly I just wanted to speak my mind as to why aome people might be awkward with their messages.",

I've tried to convince myself I could be bi, and do have sex with men occasionally, but I'm never attracted to them, I just want to suck and get fucked. \n\nI completely agree woth and applaud the OP, no one with legal sexual preferences needs to explain themselves, do what feels good and turns you on.
