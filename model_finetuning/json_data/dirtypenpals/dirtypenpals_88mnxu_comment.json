After filling out this application I made my way here slowly, with purpose but no great speed so as to not break a sweat or do anything that might give rise to pheromones or any scent that might trigger even the least prurient of thoughts. And here I am, and I will sit in the corner with my back to the rest of the room and briefly read poetry - haiku, of course, and most certainly not that dastardly cousin the limerick and most most certainly not the ribald works of a certain e.e. whose last name I most definitely will NOT be uttering here of all places. After that, perhaps a glass of your fine water and a nib - no not that word, either, just a bite, a snack, or toast. Plain, unbuttered and utterly satisfying toast, as I approach another patron and delve deeply into a discussion of he relative merits of ionic versus Doric versus Corinthian. But just the decoration stop the columns of course, with no mention of columns themselves. No, no,  not at all, don't think of that, just think of toast. Even if I have to fumble to eat it through these thick gloves, I shall dine on toast. Slightly delicious toast. ",

We only serve the driest and dullest of libations, nothing that would inspire any sort of \"feelings\" in oneself.\n\nYour haiku is acknowledged.  It is gratifying to know that we have true artistic talent gracing our admirable organization.  To offer one in return:\n\nYou are welcome here,\nAt House of Morality.\nWholesome, pure, and clean.\n\nWe have many rooms in the House of Morality with bare walls, and I am sure our Activities Director would be most interested in your suggestion for a class on painting walls and then watching said paint dry.  That is exactly the type of diversion the House of Morality prides itself on providing.  I anticipate your class will have an excellent turnout from other patrons.  Should you be interested in games, I would direct you to the light grey room on the second floor.  We offer no games of chance or anything that might encourage competition of any sort, but you will find many patrons partaking in solitary games of Concentration, Sudoku, or Solitaire.\n\nAs for specials today, we have a few events occurring that you may want to attend.\n\nThis morning there will be a lily viewing party by the pond in the gardens.  In the afternoon some of our musicians are allowing certain guests to watch as they tune their instruments.  And this evening our bartenders are offering a water tasting, showcasing some of the different varieties of water that we serve and helping you learn to differentiate between purified mountain stream water and purified glacier runoff.",

I noticed your establishment and how it promotes and regards only the utmost integrity, wholesomeness and moral well being. As most of this world is full of corruption, degradation and temptation I am always looking for a rarity such as your establishment. A sanctuary to the sanctimonious. Some of my hobbies include sexual abstinence, reading the dictionary for entertainment, chats about the days weather, wearing layers of clothing in the summer and I'm almost afraid to admit this one, as it may affect my getting in..I enjoy drinking a good Virgin Mary to calm the nerves. I believe rules were made to be kept. Without rules we would all die in chaos. Rules keep us righteous and safe. I hope that you will give my application consideration and maybe even have the opportunity to help you maintain your high standards and hold others accountable. I can only imagine what the VIP must consist of...It must be the most serine, moral location on the planet. With no transgressions or bad behavior, ever. Sounds so exiting!! If I need to send references let me know and I'd love to do so if it helps!!",
