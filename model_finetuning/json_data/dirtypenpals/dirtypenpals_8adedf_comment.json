            "body": "*sigh*\n\nBjorn, look - have you ever even heard of North Dakota?  I know, I know.. we'll get around to conquering it any day now.  Just let me explain to any onlookers, okay?\n\nThe Northish Thundercock clan (not North Dakota Thundercocks.. totally different group.  No affiliation) sent emissaries the last time DPP put out a call for mods.  It was the only sensible compromise to turning Bjorn loose and having him.. do things.. to all the advertised orifices around here.  Below is a transcript of his mod application:\n\n---\n\n\n\n**\"Impudent whelps!  Bjorn Thundercock has come!  Make propitiation to your gods and make the necessary devotions to guard those orifices you hold dearest, lest I lay ruin to them.\"**\n\n(\u2020 Translator's note: \"..those orifice you hold dearest, lest I lay ruin to them\", here, does not translate directly.  Northish oral tradition is rich with descriptions of bodily cavities and their status post-coitus.  This phrase is likely a historical reference to campaigns of antiquity.  Tradition held that subjugated vassals would be required to tithe one young woman annually to protect the virtue of the others.)\n\n(\u2021 Assistant to the Translator's note:  \"Northish oral traditions\", obviously, refers to spoken language rather than acts of fellatio (literally: \"to quicken the womb via the skull\").)\n\n&gt; What timezone are you in or rather what timezone times are you active?\n\n**\"The sun never sets on the conquests of the Thundercocks!  Nor the moon!  Ever vigilant, ever ready, ever erect!\"**\n\n(\u2020 Translator's note:  \"Sun\", literally blood disc.  \"Moon\", literally night shiv.  \"Ever vigilant, ever ready, ever erect!\" is something of a tribal motto, occasionally used as a battle cry.)\n\n&gt; What role do you see yourself filling in on the mod team? (Technical, Events, and/or Rule Enforcement)\n\n**\"Ah, but I am well versed in filling things!  A phalanx of minstrels toil tirelessly to record the many things I have filled and the many ways I have filled them.  Inkstained scribes strive to build a mountain -- a monument -- of my conquests, and no sooner have they constructed a shuffling, shifting summit of sheaves than they must redouble themselves to pen codicils, appendices, and indices to fully catalog all of the things I have filled!\"**\n\n(\u2020 Translator's note:  \"fill\", obviously, has a predictable connotation in Northish (as do most verbs).)\n\n(\u2021 Assistant to the Translator's note: ..and nouns.  In general, assume any object that is vaguely phallic is a derivative of \"cock\", then work your way backwards.)\n\n&gt; What makes you qualified to be a mod in the area(s) you are interested? Please provide examples of events you have ideas for, list technical experience, or provide reasons for why you want to be a mod.\n\n[Aside to entourage] \"I do not understand this question.  Surely they do not mean for me to recount *all* of the glories of past campaigns and conquests?  That's absurd.\"\n\n&gt; Tell us about a time when you disagreed with someone on reddit or otherwise. How did you approach the disagreement?\n\n**\"None defy the will of the Thundercock lineage for long!  Does one resist the shift of mountains?  Can one forestall the tides?  Such endeavors would be as child's play compared to denying the Thundercock a warm, moist sheathe!\"**\n\n(\u2020 Translator's note:  I'm done.  No, really - ask me to explain one more over-the-top reference to fucking and I quit.  No two week's notice.  No letter of resignation.  I'll walk right out of this fucking shambles.  I didn't go to school for this shit.)\n\n&gt; If you could add one rule to DPP what would it be?\n\n**\"The only rule that has ever been!  All will kneel before me!.. or bend over.. or lie supine.  Sometimes that back bend, arch-y thing is nice, where they make kind of a bridge.  But that's never very practical for long - almost impossible to hold that pose once you get into the heat of the moment.\"**\n\n&gt; What have you enjoyed most about your time on DPP?\n\n**\"Why, the only thing fit for The Thundercock!  All the fucking!\"**\n\n(\u2020 Translator's note:  Really?  We're adding \"The\" in front of it now?)\n\n(\u2021 Assistant to the Translator's note:  Just calm down, dude.  You're going to end up in the dungeon again.)\n\n&gt; What have you enjoyed least about your time on DPP?\n\n[Aside to entourage]  \"What does this mean?  Do they suggest that there is something other than all the fucking?  Or are they asking which of the fuckings I enjoyed less than the others?  Tell me again why we didn't just bring the horde and burn this all to the ground.\"",
