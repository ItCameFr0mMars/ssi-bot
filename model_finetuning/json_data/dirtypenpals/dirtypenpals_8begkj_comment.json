I see a lot of myself reflected in your new perspective, but I also love being called a slut or whore or cumdump during sex. Basically, it reminds me every time I'm close to having a mindblowing orgasm that there are numerous people out there that would rather see me conform to their narrow-minded constraints, and I'm sticking it to them by someone sticking it to me.",

            "body": "Really want to thank everyone for the immense outpouring of support. Really warms my heart to know that there are people out there who are okay with me as I am. For the longest time, I honestly believed that I was too disgusting to be honest about what I liked on DPP. I lived in a world in which I was just the worst thing to ever walk the earth. This wasn't because I was abused or had a bad experience or a difficult childhood. No one hit me or called me a slut or shamed me or gave me a hard time ever. I feel like the one person who hated me more than anyone was myself. The abuse I gave myself was such torture I had to take benzodiazepines and anti-depressants and sleeping pills in very high doses to try and find some peace in this world. And it just didn't work. It was awful. I felt like the way I talked to myself was such torture that being stuck in my head was on the level of an abuse of basic human rights. It got to a point where I could no longer function at work because of how lost i was in my obsessive need to cut myself down at every corner.\n\nI guess I got to a point where I had to make a choice between my career and my obsession with hating myself. I decided that I just had to give up on harassing myself. Because enough was enough. That has led me to reevaluate a lot of how I look at myself, with a corresponding improvement in my quality of life.\n\nI no longer depend on anti-anxiety medication to get through the day and no longer depend on sleeping pills to get me through the night. There are bad days, to be sure. This is still a work in progress. But the improvement in my quality of life has been substantial and I hope to never turn back to the way things were in the bad old days. To that end, it really helps to be able to come here and be able to be honest about who I am and get support.\n\nI believed for a long time that my desires were too shameful for even DPP to accept. But now I'm asking you to accept me. I am a 26-year-old attorney sitting in my office in Manhattan at one of the most prestigious law firms in the world and I'm looking at pics and gifs of big cocks on tumblr and corresponding with male pornstars to fix a time for them to fuck me (again) tonight. This is who I am. You may find that despicable, but the fact is that being honest about this stuff has allowed me to go through life drug free and able to sleep and to live with some amount of peace with myself. So yes. I'll admit it. I pay hot male pornstars with ten inch cocks to come over and fuck my ass like professionals for a couple of hours a day a few times a week. I look at pics and gifs of big cocks at work. I wear short skirts and like showing off my legs. I like turning heads and will no longer pretend like I don't enjoy and appreciate getting positive attention from men. Every girl loves being the center of a man's attention. And I'm no different.\n\nAt the same time, I want to be clear and say that being willing to accept myself is not the same as feeling a need to push my sexuality into everyone's face. I think it is important for me to remember that, while I am willing to accept my sexuality as part of who I am, I am also willing to accept that my sexuality is only a small part of who I am as a person. I hated myself for it as if my sexuality was the only thing about me that mattered, but have now decided to try and get some perspective. There is a lot more to me than just sexuality, and I don't want to go around and present myself to the world as having nothing to offer except sex.\n\nI don't know if this makes sense. To make the point, I feel like there is no better illustration than the two types of gay men that we all know. The first is like Will from Will and Grace, which is to say a normal and well adjusted person who has a lot of great qualities and a sense of humor and everything else and also happens to be gay. The second is the \"Jack\" type, which is to say a guy who is just gay and nothing but gay and desperate to have the world know that he is gay and want to talk about nothing apart from his gayness. Substitute the word \"sexuality\" for \"gay\" and you'll see what I mean. I want to be the Will type. That is, I want to be a multidimensional person who has many qualities and also happens to be interested in sex. I have no interest in developing myself into someone who does nothing apart from talk to every person who will listen about how much she loves cocks and butt sex. Decorum is a thing and good manners are important. So, I am not saying that I am going to go out into the world and start humping people on the subway. I am making a declaration here because I want to find a community of people who will support and accept me at a time when I am unprepared to talk to the people in my life about this. I want to develop this change, and don't trust the people in my real life to not try to derail my attempt to grow in this direction. So, I am posting here not so much out of exhibitionism but out of a simple search for support and community. \n\nAnd I absolutely found it. You've all been absolutely wonderful. I am still working on getting through the PMs I've received and I hope you'll keep them coming. I'll do my best to get back to you. For now, all I can do is to thank everyone for the support. I know a lot of you will encourage girls to accept anything involving anal sex no matter the story, and I am okay with that. I get that guys love anal and I think its hot that they do, because, if they didn't, then they wouldn't be willing to put their dicks in my butt. So, its okay if you just want to tell a girl to be okay with anal no matter what else is going on. But I've gotten quite a few messages from people who got that the point here is accepting who you are generally, and it has really warmed my heart to hear from you. I will get back to you in turn but please bear with me as I'll need time to work through the PMs I've received. For now, thanks so much again! ",
