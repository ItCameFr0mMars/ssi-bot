At worst or best depending on how you view it - and I tend to assume governments are incompetent and honestly doubt even this will happen - if there are people meeting up IRL that've begun their correspondence via PMs and those people prove to be underage THOSE people will get in trouble or further investigated but that's going to be more of a Reddit-wide thing than it is a DPP thing.\n\nThe one thing I *would* say is that AgePlayPenpals is probably going to catch a wayward glance. Then again I, while I haven't been much further into the underbelly of Reddit than here, would also assume that there ARE subreddits out there that're a bit more dark and twisted than APP who'll cop it a lot worse. Even APP is probably going to be fine assuming people aren't meeting up irl. ",
