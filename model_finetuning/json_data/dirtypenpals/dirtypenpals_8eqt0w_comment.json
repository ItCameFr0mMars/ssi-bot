It's awesome knowing that all you do has been good for you, too.\n\nI've learned about myself from DPP not as a man but as a writer.  I've enjoyed shifting away from my initial attempts to fit the RP set and move deeper toward vignette.  I've played a lot with style and voice, with the explicit and suggested.  I've had a lot of wild exchanges, partners, passions, infatuations.\n\nI've even started to [Share] of late, loved the support of partners + playmates.  Recently I went for more, seeking prompts on DWP (/r/DirtyWritingPrompts/).  Purely public, out and open, no privacy to hide me.  Just words.  Simple, plain; my attempt at ambition.\n\nI still find the orange envelope exiting.  It's something simple, something pure.  That spark of shared imagination, someone saying, \"I want more.\"\n\nI've come to see that this is me, salacious smut, pornography.  I love to write it, love to share, love to hear the feedback (firm and fair).\n\nLately my daydreams drift this way: Erotic Authors (/r/eroticauthors/): a bigger, braver game to play.",

I've learned that I really enjoy writing with a very particular sort of dynamic, that I really enjoy writing with a particular sort of person, and I've sort of learned, more specifically, *why* I like the thinks I like. Like... butt stuff, for instance. Before I started writing in earnest on DPP, I would've said, sure, I like the notion of putting my cock in a cute girl's butt, and doing things with that, but through writing (and a smattering of real-world experiences that have mostly overlapped the time I've been on DPP) and really confronting how to portray that appeal to others, I've gained a much better understanding of where the appeal there comes from, for me, at least. \n\nBut probably the most impactful thing that DPP has brought me is... I guess you could say, in contrast to your own broadening of sexual tastes, I've found mine becoming more narrow, more refined. Not in a highbrow sense - Lord knows I write filthy, trashy stuff quite a bit - but I've gotten a much better handle on who it is I actually want to play with. When I started on DPP, I was frustrated, annoyed at how hard it is to find a partner to play with, as a M4F writer. I ended up playing with people that I wasn't terribly attracted to, and who treated me like shit because, frankly, they had dozens just like me queuing up to play. But through a lot of self-exploration and finding some genuinely good partners over the past months (years?), I've realized that I ought to write for myself first and foremost, writing prompts that I find fun in the very writing of, and reply occasionally to people whose writing I very much enjoy, and, most importantly, that I should have some respect for myself. I've learned to play when it feels like play, not work, to value my own time and dignity, and to feel comfortable seeking out partners who want me just as much as I want them.\n\nEnthusiasm, I've found, is far more important than skill, just as it is in real-life sexual adventures, for the most part - someone who genuinely wants to have fun with you, who finds you fun, who wants to make you feel good and spin a story with you, is worth far more than someone who has impeccable technical mastery of the written word. Granted, there are those out there who I firmly believe have *both* - you know who you are, I think - but I've certainly developed a taste for those who write with passion, not necessarily poise. And I think that's reflected not only in my own writing but in the sorts of things I find myself attracted to. \n\nI've also developed a fondness for the word \"dong\" and a thing for limericks, though, so go figure, y'know?

While I have broad tastes just due to my personality, I am very particular with who I partner with on this journey of exploration. As much as I like sticking my cock in butts, I won't be sticking it anywhere if my partner isn't descriptive as well as literate. If I'm allowed those luxuries then my erotic writing exchanges never feel like work.\n\nOn the note of frustration and M4F - I completely agree in terms of writing for my own satisfaction. I write really specific prompts that flesh out my deepest desires. It's what I need to do to have a running dialogue with myself about what I truly want to experience. I find no reason to compromise in that aspect.\n\nI've seen you drop encouraging notes on people's posts and that kind of inspired me to find a way to encourage others to keep writing and write the things they desire instead of writing to get the best chances of attracting writing partners.",
