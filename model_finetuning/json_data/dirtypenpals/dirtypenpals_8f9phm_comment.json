Everyone was on three or four cards left in library, and this smug player across from me brags that he's waiting to topdeck Elixir of Immortality. He flips it over and goes *nuts*. Like, jumps across the room nuts as he resets his library and waits for me to die.\n\nWhat I *don't* brag about is that I'm waiting to topdeck Living Death. Which I do. And I'm the only one left with a full graveyard.\n\nI could see the joy in his heart crumble to ash.\n",
