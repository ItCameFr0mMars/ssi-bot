Cheating on him then sticking the knife deeper by mocking something he was probably insecure about anyway. Who does that?!\n\nInsecurities are tough to deal with. What you're saying makes perfect logical sense and I 100&amp;#37; believe you. As I'm sure he does. However, for him to truly internalize it and get past his insecurities will take time. There's no magic bullet here, sadly.\n\nJust keep reassuring him and be patient. Make sure he knows he's all you ever need. ",
