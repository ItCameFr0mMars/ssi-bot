            "body": "Let me add a point or ten, as I already had this written and just haven't found a good time to post it yet. Individual points are in no particular order\n\nGeneral writing advice\n----------------------\n\nUse proper grammar and vocabulary. \n\nBe concise. After you write a *complete* sentence, *actually* consider if there are any *superfluous* words in it that you do not need, then throw them out *wholesale*, like every italicized word in this *pointlessly verbose* sentence. Adjectives and adverbs are fun and important, but it's very easy to overdo them. The fewer you use, the more impactful the remaining ones are.\n\nWrite dialog in a different voice than the rest of the prose. Especially when you write in third person the dialog often feels more alive when your characters have speaking quirks. Androids speak only short and simple sentences. An ancient demon might perhaps be lugubriously flowery in her sophisticated diction. The punk girl bloody fuckin' curses all the damn time.\n\nMany of these rules are contradicting guidelines, and can and should be bent and broken (Jack Sparrow was right). The trick is to break them knowingly and deliberately, for the explicit purpose to make the text more enjoyable to read.\n\nAdd seemingly meaningless details. The colour of the curtains. The designer of the sofa. The type of cardboard box. If you just add one tiny thing to every couple paragraphs, after a dozen posts your world feels much more alive and real. When you describe the Amazon packages as way too large for the sex toys inside, everybody can relate to it, and feels smart for getting the joke. Instead of going full on GRRMartin and spending two pages on what's for dinner, leave gaps in these descriptions to fill in later.\n\nBe consistent with themes. Make the packaging fit the toy. When you match a character's apartment to their clothes to their speech to their belongings, things feel more real than if you jump from one fun detail to another without explanation.\n\nUse contrast. Describing a sex-bot's internals as a thrown-together mess of cables is much more effective if you establish first that it is smooth, shiny and elegant. When your time-travelling Roman poet uses the word \"fuck\", you know shit has definitely hit the fan.\n\nGive your characters weaknesses and strengths. Mary Sues are boring, but so are total failures. Let them make mistakes, let them put themselves into bad positions.\n\n\nSpecific to roleplaying online in text form\n--------------------\n\nWrite what you think the other person would love to read. Write for them, not for yourself. \n\nCommunicate clearly what you want in ooc. In fact, do not be afraid of ooc talk. There is nothing sadder than a ghosted conversation because of a misunderstanding which neither party tried to clear up.\n\nTake your time. Spend a couple extra minutes to proofread, or even an extra hour to write something really good instead of something barely passable. I would rather wait a while than read something totally uninspired.\n\nDo not shut your partner down. This is incredibly important. Yes, you can fall unconscious or say \"the next morning\", but communicate and agree upon this ooc first. Nothing makes your partner's blood boil faster than if they have a nice plot point planned, spend a lot of effort on setting it up without it feeling forced, only to be denied to write the payoff because their character is now literally alone in the room.\n\nWrite open endings to your paragraphs. This can be quite subtle: If you ask them a yes/no-question in the last sentence (and it's obvious that your character needs to act on it), they have the problem that they can only write a single word before they lose focus.\n\nKeep the plot going. A shocking number of people seem to write purely reactive pieces. If I wanted to write the whole story, I might just as well write a novel instead. The joy of writing cooperatively is that twice as many people can keep the story going, and it's much easier to not run into a dead end. Unless of course one person is lazy or does not notice that they are killing the tempo.\n\nRefer to a detail brought up before (by either of you). This makes adding details so much worth it: You can later reuse some of them, turning it into a naturally occurring plot point. Use the breadcrumbs you are given. Why do you think my character looked at herself sheepishly in the gigantic mirror for no real reason? Because I obviously want you to fuck her in front of it.\n\nWrite for the moment. Don't be afraid of overdoing it, this is not text to be read by a dozen editors and talked about in fan-forums for years. Get to the point, paint with strong and decisive strokes, and do not hesitate to use a few tropes. Do not fret over having circumstances line up *just so* to make your story work.\n\nPander to your partner. This is a one-on-one situation (usually), and there is no good reason why you should hold back when it comes to pleasing that one specific person you are writing for. Are they a lesbian? Well then of course every single character in the story is now a woman who flirts with them. Because why the fuck not.\n\n\n----\n\nAnd of course, I have probably broken all of my advice in spectacular fashion before and angered my partners to the point where they were cursing the screen. I have been told by two people in the last year that my writing is completely horrible. I got told I try too hard, and I got told that I try not hard enough (by the same person). There was probably some truth to all of that (except for the one where someone told me that only women can write well, and men cannot: that's just ridiculous).\n\nSo the last rule is very simple: Forgive your partner for fucking up, because you will need that same forgiveness a couple posts down the line. So I will re-iterate this once more: Go OOC when something is wrong. Anyone who is worth playing with will gladly talk OOC to turn a mediocre snooze-fest into a magnificent work of art.\n\nAnd don't ghost.\n\nEdit: Downvotes? Well shit, no wonder I can't find a writing partner.",

It's highly dysfunctional, but we have nothing better, so we grit out teeth and live with it.\n\n(And yes: This is mostly an issue because *reddit* is not built for this specific kind of interaction - It's a horrible fit.)\n\nSadly even if someone made a better system, it would be a pain to migrate there, because I guarantee you that linking to it would be forbidden.",
