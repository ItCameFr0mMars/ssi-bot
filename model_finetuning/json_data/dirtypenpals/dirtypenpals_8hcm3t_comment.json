I've lived here like 10+ years, and the only randomness I spotted was a hung homeless dude completely stripped down on the train... I mean, looking back it was captivating, but the means didn't really suit the method. I get it: when your stacked on top of one another random acts of nudity aren't cool. Because your audience is literally all ages 24/7. But, I mean Saturday night should get a little weird sometimes, right? Girls are even legally Allowed to be topless, here.

            "body": "This is purely speculation but I think it all comes down to the most basic principles of psychology and neurology: neurons that fire together wire together.  \nWe start developing sexually pretty much from birth. Infants will actually press their genitals against the padding of their cribs and we start touching our genitals because they fell tinlgy long before we even know the meaning behind it.  \nThe way I look at it, kinks and fetishes are probably linked to mental associations we don't even conciously register as they're being made. Basically, at some point one feels aroused or \"they feel that tingle\" whilst some other, unrelated stimuli is simultaneously involved and those two things become linked with repeated exposure to the same combination.  \nFor example, and I'm going to use watersports \\(pee\\) as an example here because it's the easiest hypothetical scenario I can come up with, let's say someone is into pee.  \nWell, maybe as a kid, they were someone who wet their pants long past the usual age \\(pretty common with cases of undiagnosed adhd and/or learning disabilities\\). At some point, that person probably experienced arousal or \"that tingly feeling\" while their pants were soaked. Perhaps they often went to the bathroom at the last possible minute which often resulted in the blissful \"omg it feels so good to finally go\" piss which might have spurred a tingle here and there.  \nBasically, arousal and an external stimuli , pee in this instance, become linked. A sub\\-concious connection is made.  \n\n\nyou could probably apply this to many other kinks. One thing I've heard about though I can't find any info on at the moment is that our sex drive activates the same portions of our brain as the ones active when we're in play mode; feeling playful. I've heard that there have been surveys conducted with BDSM crowds where they scenarios they acted out in playing pretend as children often included things like hostage taking and hand cuffs \\(playing cops and robbers\\), or being interrogated.  \n\n\nThis is actually why I don't feel like I can judge any kink no matter how off putting it might seem. Things can look sinister but I'm kind of convinced it all just comes down to the many bizarre and unusual connections our brains make without our knowledge. There's really no telling what things will link to our aroused state throughout our sexual development.",
