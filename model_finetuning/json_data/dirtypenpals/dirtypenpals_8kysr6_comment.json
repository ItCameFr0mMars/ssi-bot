As you follow the paths through the woods which intersect and loop in several spots you pass an older married man who is enjoying the warm sunlit day. Each time you pass one another, he gives you a smile and nod. There is something reassuring in his eyes and you can't help but feel drawn to him...each time you hope he will say hello so that you can hear the sound of his voice.\n\nWhat happens when he says \"hello?\"\n\nI enjoy writing erotica and actually wrote an impregnation story that happens between two strangers if you may be interested.",
