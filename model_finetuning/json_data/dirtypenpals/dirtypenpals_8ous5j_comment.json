Your kink is niche, this isn't a big community, so you need to be really lucky to find someone with the same kink.\n\nThe second thing I've noticed, some of your posts are just one paragraph, which doesn't really look pretty or just appealing. You could be more descriptive, or just tell people more about your kinks and limits, maybe a fun scenario.\n\nGetting ghosted is not fun, but you can't really do anything about it, just get over it. Sure, the RP could've been awesome, but you'll find a better one eventually. Someone who I've been role-playing with for two months suddenly his account, and it annoyed me, but I don't really care anymore now.\n\n",

Maybe when things get hot and heavy and clothes start to come off, you just insist she keep the mask on. As someone else already mentioned, you need to show any readers what writing with you will be like.\n\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent ghosting. Life happens to everyone. You can swear up and down that you'll never ghost but sometimes real life grabs you by the balls. Personally, I communicate with my partners if I plan to be gone for a few days. Unfortunately I can't always even get on to send that out so sometimes after like three days pass it just feels awkward to reply. I don't know. Ghosting happens. You may never know if it was your fault or theirs so just keep your chin up and keep trying.\n\nTHE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE FOR ENJOYMENT OF DPP IS TO START WRITING FOR YOURSELF. CREATE PROMPTS THAT YOU ENJOY WRITING. IF YOU JUST DON'T ENJOY WRITING THERE ARE SUBS FOCUSED ON DIRTY KIK EXCHANGES. WRITE BECAUSE WRITING IS FUN FOR YOU.",
