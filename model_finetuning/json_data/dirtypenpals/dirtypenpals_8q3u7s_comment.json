This isn't about 'no response in a hour/couple hours' deal though, but no reply in like a day or more.\n\nGhosting happens. People will just shut up shop, go silent and not respond to you if they don't like how something is going or a particular response. And yes, I have messaged after a day of silence to ask before, and nine times out of ten gotten no reply after a RP has gotten going. Or worse, told that my last reply hadn't gotten through only for them to be snarky about it and ghost me again. \n\nI accept the reddit messaging system can be borked at times, but to imply that there are those who will always respond or message back is simply wrong. There are plenty of decent responders out there of course, but there's a fair share of spooky ghosts too.",

It was going to be a slaughter.\n\nBut I was an idiot and did it anyway. We've now known each other for half a decade and are amazing friends and writers. She always laughs when she sees just how intimidated I was by her. I've had similar conversations with people about how they outwardly appear versus how they actually are and while a handful are high and mighty, most are just... People.\n\nIt's important to remember that it's always just another person on the other side. They are mythical, they aren't unapproachable. Take that chance. Type up that response. Take your time.

From all the messages, I've been replied to by only one, and although we started building up something, it came to a standstill soon enough without any reason (talk about ghosting). \n\nMy point is, many of those who DO message and take their most of time writing a proper introduction don't even receive a \"Sorry, but I don't think you will make a good partner for my taste. Thank you for writing\" or something in the line. We receive **blank**. \n\nAnd now you'll say that maybe they got flooded with messages or something, but as your own post described, 20 upvotes and yet 5 messages only, so let's be honest, rarely someone is actually *flooded* with so many messages they can't send a 10 words reply. \n\nI think in the end this is a matter of (and I use the word really loosely here) education. Apparently common sense and kindness are all championed in this subreddit in public interactions, but how many of us actually uphold those *values* in PMs? Hmm\u2026\n",
