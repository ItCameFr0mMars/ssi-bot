Then I come across an open door I thought I heard something, I peak my head inside the door. \n\nThere you are, eyes closed, your chest heaving. I can hear shallow short breaths and the occasional whimper escapes your throat. Your mouth is open. Your brow is slightly furrowed and you bite your lip.\n\nI am quiet. The last thing I want to do is stop you. I \nam so turned on. Looking at you slowly bringing yourself to orgasm. It is the most amazing thing I have seen. My cock is stirring, straining against my pants.\n\nI reach down and start stroking myself. The sensation of my fingers outlining my dick is sending waves of pleasure through me. My breathing quickens. The sound brings you out of your trance. Your eyes are wide, your hand is stuck between your thighs.\n\nI am a little panicked, I know you are married, this is my job.  If you freak out I am done. Then I see your gaze go from my face to my crotch. I never stopped stroking myself. You bite your lip again you catch my gaze.\n\nYour eyes are piercing. I watch as you begin to rock your hips side to side as you are rubbing your thighs together. I catch my breath........",

            "body": "&lt;disclaimer&gt; Hey, so, I know this isn\u2019t a writing prompt exactly and I\u2019m doing it wrong, but you inspired this reply and I chanced to share. Never written fiction and would welcome feedback. &lt;/disclaimer&gt;\n\n\u2014-\n\nHe knocked with a sigh on the office door and adjusted his tool belt, tight with anticipation for his difficult client. This was the second time this week he\u2019d arrived to a brusque note about the \u201cunlivable conditions\u201d in her office, as though the thermostat being a degree off was a matter for amnesty international and not just another first-world problem. A hurried \u201ccome in\u201d filtered through the heavy door, and he pressed his thick hand into the cool metal handle. \n\nPurposefully moving his large frame through the doorway, he scanned the room, his eyes barely sipping her behind the desk. Best not to grant his entitled charge the satisfaction of a long look. Unfortunately, as she stood, framed by the large window behind, her shape drew notice even from the abstractions of peripheral vision. The silhouette of her hips, waist, and chest spoke directly to an old, animal part of his brain, pulling his eyes onto her in spite of himself. God damn it. A crisp, pristine white shirt gave over to a thick charcoal wool pencil skirt at her waist, all expertly fit and likely coming at the cost of more he\u2019d take home this week. All this for controlling the attentions of men, likely a favorite game of hers and likely worth every penny to look the part. Fuck that shit. Today we fix the fucking thermostat and get on with it, sans stroking of entitled egos.\n\nSharp green eyes flicked from her desk up to him distractedly, her rib cage subtly heaving as though fresh from an argument. It would not be the first time he found himself the focus of anger unbecoming of the situation. Part of the job actually; description read, \u201cgeneral maintenance, repair, and pacification of perpetually frustrated asshats.\u201d Or should have anyway. Oh well, good for her; gets to blow of a little steam at work after her boyfriend screwed up her eggs this morning or some shit. Scratch that, husband; this one had a ring. All the more rage for her to redirect then. He smiled.\n\n\u201cSame problem as before?\u201d He used the sentence to pull his focus back from idle musings to the task at hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fucking cold in here isn\u2019t it?\u201d She was too preoccupied to fully snap her reply. All worked up about something; something that had fuck all to do with the brushed steel thermostat housing high on the wall. \n\nHe softened a bit at the thought of getting his hands on something he could fix, imagining the mercury trembling within the simple old switch. He reached up to the perforated box to feel for the release. This felt good. Seeing his strong arms pull further out of his black T-shirt to reach the box, feeling his shoulders shift under the cotton. Thin, tan carpenter pants pulling into the seat and bulge of his pants, betraying a source of his confidence. Then a lightness in his chest; she was staring at him. He could oddly feel her stare; his body greedily drew it\u2019s heat into itself. His old, animal brain was alert now. He regained control. Fuck that shit, no way he\u2019d risk a good job to give this bitch an ego trip. Wrap this shit up and get the fuck out of here, he repeated to himself. He took a breath. He unsheathed the sensor and inspected it closely, then risked a glance at her.\n\nShe flushed over her already flustered affect. She was not angry. She was uncomfortably aroused, something he hadn\u2019t seen enough to see quickly. But she was hurting for it plain as day.\n\n\u201cExcuse me I have work to do,\u201d she managed unconvincingly, darting into the copy room adjacent her office. After a beat, she said in a slightly off tone, \u201ccould you help me in here, please?\u201d He felt his legs pulling him across the room towards the source of the words.\n\nRounding the corner into the tight room, he saw her facing away from him and leaning on the copier, trying to suppress her still-heaving breath. \u201cWhat do I need to do to get these to feed in here,\u201d she said weakly, refusing to face him. He walked up behind her to see the display, obscured by her shoulder in the cramped space of the room. He moved closer to look over her petite frame at the screen, and as his arm moved along hers to the panel he realized he had moved too close. She was inches from him and he could feel her gravity pulling him in. She trembled. Maybe she moved toward him a bit, maybe not; the space between collapsed and they flooded into each other. Patiently waiting for him to catch up, his cock had swollen down his leg and was pressed into her. This woman needed badly to be fucked. He needed badly to fuck her. Everything else was static.\n\nHis body ached to consume her; his warm, large hands traced over her fingers, feeling the stone on her left hand. As if in response, he reached up to her stomach, pulling her into him, pushing up to her breasts, feeing every inch of the front of her and her hard nipples through everything. Surrounding her, he leaned over to the nape of her neck, drinking her into his nose as it traced the side of her neck up to her ear; she shuddered again and he throbbed against her, a drop of wetness leaking out of him. He ached to slide that wet head into her. Now. He whispered this against her ear and she arched into him.\n\nStill on her chest, his hands ripped her shirt open and pulled away her bra, unleashing her into the cool air. Pinned against the copier and rubbing herself against him and he machine she whimpered pleadingly. Calluses slid down over her skirt, rasping over the coarse wool before grasping it firmly and pulling it down. Her wet panties clung desperately for an instant, then slid down her legs, releasing the smell of her sex to him. She was completely exposed to him now, her bare ass unprotected. As he knelt to slide those last barriers down her legs to the floor, he pushed his face into her. Jesus Christ she was wet. He relished her taste and stretched his tongue into her, then gently left and right over her clit, growing swollen out of its hood. From above him, her voice strong now, she blurted \u201cquit fucking around i need it\u201d He rose again, replying with a bracing slap on her ass, sending a pleasurable current rolling through her body.\n\nBriefly savoring her incredible body as he stood behind and over her again, he moved her hips to turn her towards him. She pushed his hands off and stayed against the copier, hissing \u201cNO. Fucking TAKE it.\u201d\n\nWhile he briefly pondered this, she reached behind and pulled his cock, tip wet as fuck, out of his pants by the base of the shaft. He was large and swollen now, and her high heels pushed her sex right up in front of him. He slid it back across her clit and slipped into her heat and it was everything. More pre-cum leaked inside with the ache of penetrating her with his naked cock. She made the most strange and wonderful sound as he answered the aching in her.\n\nHe grabbed her shoulders and pushed her  down into the copier. She smiled as her warm flesh pressed into the cool copier lid for a moment before it warmed at her touch. He pushed harder into her now, and her clit rubbed on the front of the machine while he spread her out and thrust impossibly deep inside her. Her arousal opened her up; he pushed into a deeper spot she hadn\u2019t felt before. It scared her for an instant, but each thrust that pressed into that spot made her lose control of her legs, and a warmth was spreading down her legs and up into her cheeks, spreading further with each steady thrust and taking her whole body away from her. Their musk filled the tiny room.\n\nThe sound of her coming close was intensely arousing; he felt even more blood rush into his already tingling cock. She was so slippery and deep for him as she came close, and he held his tip firmly against that spot as she shuddered. He felt the bottom of her; her supple, fertile cervix lips pressed onto the end of him. Hungry lips. He took her for his own, his naked cock spraying heat through into her womb. The pressure on that spot with the warm surge of him past her defenses shoved her unceremoniously flailing over the edge, gasping, shaking, and weeping from both ends as she came. \n\nShe spasmed again, pulling him into her. Two hundred million sperm frenetically raced to their destiny. Her phone buzzed on her desk.",
