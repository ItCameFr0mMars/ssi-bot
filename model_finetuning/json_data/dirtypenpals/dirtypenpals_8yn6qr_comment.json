            "body": "I stumble in an hour late... seeing the writhing bodies of the men that you have left in orgasmic bliss. Your passion remains unrelenting and unresolved. For a minute I panic and think I can make a quick exit before I become another statistic...But I stumble over a sweaty trucker and face plant right into the thigh of a seven eleven slurpy salesman. Thankful that I didn't get a face full of cock.\n\n(OMG your prompt is over and hour old, I need to type faster, or you will be asleep and someone else will get all the good words.)\n\nI start to back out of the door...\n\n\"YOUUUUUUU\" .... \"Do you have a penis\"....?\n\n\"Uh, Yes\", I softly reply.\n\n\"Does it work?!\" you ask, your eyes narrow at me through the haze.... the room smells of sex and .... \"Is that , Is that Lavender\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply, \"you like Lavender?\"\n\nI low growl starts in my chest.... rumbling up through my neck....\n\nSuddenly my cock bursts through my pants, like a little blue pill through the cheap tinfoil....\n\n\"I LOOVE LAVENDER... IT MAKES ME HARD\" I growl at you, my chest heaving.\n\nYour look of confidence disappears and I see for the first time... apprehension.\n\n\"What about Cottage Breeze\" you question...\n\nmy cock stutters for a second... almost faltering.... \"I inhale deep... the Lavender filling my viens... bringing my cock back to its full girth\"\n\nI jump on you like an Australian Shepard on a bare leg.... driving into you with wanton lust as you moan in ecstasy.... one hand on a riding crop, the other on a can of Lavender febreeze.\n\nI Inhale filling my lungs with each deep thrust.... as the windows shatter from your orgasmic cries.\n\nThe spent men, slowly sit up and cheer us on... as we knock the headboard through the wall and finish in front of your neighbors... the Platmyers.\n\nMrs Platmyer seems rather disturbed... \"See Henry\", she complains, \"How come you never fuck me like that?\"\n\n\"For fuck sake Myrtle, I'm 96\" Henry replies.\n\n\"Yeah, were ya 96 when we got married\" Myrtle retorts.\n\nFor a moment I am afraid Mrs Platmyer will actually climb on the bed...\n\nThen I feel it... my toes cramp.... electricity shoots up my leggssss.... I feel like I might barf, I almost stop the impassioned lovemaking that is driving us towards the Platmyers kitchen.\n\nI'mmmm gonnnnaaaaa .... I'mmm Gonnnnaaaa........Arrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............I pull out and scream as I hold my turgid member quivering above your belly.... stroking furiously, you brace yourself for the glazing of your life....\n\nFinally ... a small popping sound and drop of white goo shoots listlessly out of my cock landing unceremoniously forming a large... drop between your navel and the delicate flower of your sex.\n\n\"REally?\" you look at me quizzically.......\"Really?",
