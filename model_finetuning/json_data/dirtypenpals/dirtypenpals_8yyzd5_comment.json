            "body": "Hi. I am not a mod, but I would like to give you my thoughts on a few of the points you are ranting about.\n\n&gt; **NSFW** Pics The rules list ten very specific things which are not allowed in images. If I go through the list of posts on the front page or on the new page, I see barely any pictures, and of those pictures, I really don't find anything highly offensive, or obviously in plain sight.\n\nYou don't see NSFW-Images on the hot tab because the lewd ones get removed. You don't see them on the new tab because they get removed quickly. Take a look over at APP, they don't have a rule like this... and the posts over there are often riddled with more than twenty versions of blowjob-gifs, jailbait-bikini-pictures, and the likes. If there was no rule filtering content like that, this sub would be no different. This should be about writing, but truth is, many people already don't care about that and post shit that needs to be removed because there are better subs for it. \n\n&gt; What exactly is this rule trying to accomplish? The problem it tries to solve does not exist. This is like the Senate spending two weeks on writing a bill that forbids landing on the moon in all detail: Nobody is doing it!\n\n The most important part here is (probably) that a lot of people are using DPP at work or university (me included). A wall of text is not to worry someone walking by, neither is a picture of a clothed person. But if my professor would look at my screen while I am clicking through a prompt filled with bukkake gifs, I could get in trouble. Don't think I need to explain the concept of NSFW though.\n\n&gt; Why does this rule even exist? \"This is a writing subreddit and the focus should not be on pictures\" should more than suffice. No need to be more precise! The beauty of not being precise is that you can be the judge of what is acceptable and what is not on a case by case basis. You know: Moderation.\n\nI don't get what you are trying to say here. How would you attempt to enforce something like *\"yeah don't focus on pictures please ok thanks\"*? Where would you draw the line? Can you even imagine how many discussions the staff would have with salty posters that think a 50/50 ratio of pictures and words is just fine? This clarification is just trying to reduce the number of arguments, at least I think it is. Precision isn't a bad thing. All this clarification does is making moderation easier.\n\n&gt; Under age How many hundred words was that? Why the need to be so specific to begin with?\nLet me write the rule: \"No underage characters, and no attempting to circumvent the rule.\" There, that's all you need.\nPersonally I really couldn't care less what crazy fetishes other people write about to begin with.\n\nSame as above. Precision reduces the number of arguments, especially with the *300-year-old-aktschually* crowd. And this is a very important rule. You might not know it, but there was a recent purge in ageplay related subreddits. The Admins are controlling this stuff. And if they were to have a bad day, and there were posts about 400-year-old toddlers on this sub, that might not go well for DPP. The mods don't want to risk that. Again, this post is not about *new* rules. See it as an FAQ that tries to reduce the number of posts that need to be deleted for the greater good of DPP. Apparently, that was necessary. DPP is growing, they are even looking for new moderators. That's what this (probably) is about. Reducing the necessary work.\n\n&gt; Yeah, let's make this as anonymous as possible. It's pretty hilarious that you once posted a meet and greet thread. I mean we are literally disallowed from talking to each other or about each other, how is that even going to work? This is one of the things that make me really sad about this sub. I can't even compliment another writer without risking a ban.\n\nI kind of agree with you here, at least to an extent. I don't like not being able to include my partner's name in a SHARE post, and it seems like that's forbidden now? I guess? Other than that, I don't know why it would ever be necessary to mention someone else. If you want to compliment someone's writing, leave a comment? Or even, god forbid, an upvote.\n\n&gt; **Why?** It's nice that there are thousands of rules (no, not really, but bear with me), but why do there need to be these rules? Do they improve the place? Do they fix issues? Because I have trouble even finding theoretical use-cases for half of them, much less having seen any of them put to good use.\nHowever I've come into contact with them a few times as false positives, and it was aggravating and ridiculous every single time.\n\nI hope I could give you a few hints at how these **clarifications** (again, no new rules) improve DPP. They reduce the number of discussions that are solved by a post like this. No pointless arguments if a picture really is NSFW, no need to tell every ageplay-poster why Harry-Potter-School-Prompts are a no-no even though Harry swallowed a youth potion that only makes him *look* young again.\n\nThese rules fix problems other subreddits have. Problems we would have too without them. You don't see those problems, because they are already moderated. You can't see the mod queue. Oh, be glad you can't, I heard it is a horrible place :P\n\n&gt; Am I the only one around here who thinks this is both going too far while missing the point completely?\n\nYes, I think that's exactly what this, *your comment*, is doing. This is not about rule changes. It is a handy reminder of what the existing rules **include**. \n\n&gt; This is a tiny niche subreddit. Why the need to have more rules than a politics forum?\n\nIt is by no means tiny 125k subscribers is not tiny. Multiple posts per minute is not tiny. \n\nI hope this could help you understand what this post was about...\n\n***\n\nPS: Dear mods, I hope I got those things right. \n",

            "body": "I know this is an old post that is probably completely settled by now, but there is so much inaccuracy here that it's really painful:\n\n&gt; This is completely incorrect. If you compare the US law system to most of Europe, you notice that the US is much more literal, and has much more precise laws. Now guess who has more arguments, more lawsuits and more lawyers: It's the US, and not by a little.\n\nYou are putting the cart before the horse. The reason the US has more, more literal, and more precise laws is not why people are more litigious, it is BECAUSE people are more litigious. We have a different culture, and the legal system reflects that, not the other way around.  And because people are more litigious, they find loopholes, and new laws and regulations have to be created to close them.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, unlike most (all?) European countries, the US legal system operates on common law, rather than civil law - because we believe in the rule of law (objective, blind justice), legal precedent has standing here. In civil law, justices have more discretion in interpretation, but that also makes the legal system much more subjective. In Europe, where there is a much larger degree of cultural homogeneity, this goes over pretty well, but you'll notice that when they start to become heterogeneous, as is the case now with the influx of refugees, legal crises develop as the assumptions that arise in homogeneity do not serve all members. The United States is intentionally and expressly pluralistic, a heterogeneous melting pot, and common law is the best way to make sure that all members are treated fairly.\n\nThat's important because in a subreddit of this scale, the goal of the mods here is to handle things as objectively as possible, so nobody feels targeted. It's far, far too easy for people to interpret subjectivity as favoritism, and far too easy for it to become so. Especially when a subreddit like this is an amalgam of people with different intentions, different tastes, and different attitudes, sometimes with zero overlap between parties.\n\n&gt; The more detailed rules you make, the more arguments you produce, because detailed rules always result in loop holes which can be argued about.\n\nExactly wrong. That's simply not how it works. There is not a fractalized infraction - people do something that creates an edge case, and if it happens egregiously enough that it can't be handled with individual guidance, a new regulation is included. And when possible, the wording is updated to include new and old rules in a streamlined version.\n\n&gt; I have been a moderator on a very large board for years, and we had very few rules.\n\nI have, in a previous incarnation, been a moderator in *this subreddit*. I in no way speak for the current moderation team, but as I am not a current moderator, I can freely speak my mind: I quit moderation because of ungracious, ungrateful responses like this that shit on the efforts of the moderation team without any appreciation for the effort that goes onto it, while handling dozens of issues *at that moment* that directly refuted posts like this, but which we didn't talk about for the privacy of others.\n\nDo you think there are rules because mods are on a power trip? That is such a laugh! It's because they have a heart for the community and field many, many complaints daily, and this is the best effort at a low-touch system that makes the safest, most fun space for the largest number of users. \n\n&gt; when you have a simple rule that says \"No minors / no loli!\" because it really didn't matter what they argue: When a mod decides that this goes against the rule, what is the pedo going to argue? There's nothing they can point to that saves them through specificity.\n\nAnd that's exactly when you get people complaining about favoritism, and you have mods either having to quorum on every decision, or they handle it differently, and you have inconsistent decisions. \"X said it was okay yesterday, but Y says it's not today! Y has it in for me!\" \n\n&gt; I browse exclusively by NEW. I have literally never seen a post which had too many pictures in the ~18 months I've been actively posting and reading here nearly every day\n\nHooray for you! When I was a mod, I sent out dozens of notices daily! And that was AFTER the work of the wonderful Automod bot, that would immediately hide and message the user if a post had too many links. Go ahead and try to create a post like that and see what happens.\n\n&gt; We also do not get multiple posts per minute at all: The currently newest post is 8 minutes old, and the last post on the first page is nearly 1 hour old (and there are 26 posts on that page).\n\nYou're almost correct there! Last I saw (granted, this was nearly 18 months ago), we were getting about 2500 posts a day on average. That works out to about 1.7 posts a minute, which is in fact not quite multiple. However, those are not equally distributed, so you'd have about 60% of the posts during a 4 hour-long blocks (largely focused on US Eastern and US Western work schedules), and the other 40% scattered among other peaks and valleys. So you'd very likely see posts further apart depending on when you checked. I'm writing as of late Saturday night GMT-5 right now, which is a lull period, and we're definitely averaging more than one post per minute: https://i.imgur.com/hCIrUcL.jpg\n\n&gt; As I said: There isn't a real problem, this is security theatre at best.\n\nYou literally have no idea what you're talking about. You have no idea how many complaints the mods handle, how much of what you say \"doesn't happen\" is filtered out by automod, how many really serious issues have arisen that necessitate rules to keep the subreddit afloat, or from fracturing. If you enjoy this community, please take a deep breath, take a step back, and send a message to the mod team thanking them for their service. Many of them put in multiple hours on a daily basis, not having fun, but volunteering unpaid work just to keep this a clean, safe place for people to have fun. And if you really think you know better than they do, sign up when they have an open call for mods, so you can do it better than them. I guarantee to the very last once they're eager for fewer rules and easier jobs, if you can just show them your mad moderation skills.",

This adds a lot of flavor to your original post, and goes a long way to undermine your suggestion that fewer, simpler rules would be more honestly understood, doesn't it? \n\nGuess what? I, while a mod, had to delete a couple of my own posts because I unintentionally violated the rules, or forgot one of them. It totally happens; I get it. And on that account, even posting M4F, most of my posts were front page and had comments on them. But if you handle it gracefully, and attempt to work within the rules, you can generally just correct your post (since they're typically hidden, not removed) and check to make sure it works, and there you go! You're back in business. The only exception would be a post that violated fundamental rules, which would be nothing like \"technically\".  \n\nSo, either you weren't aware of the possibility of correcting the prompt so it goes live again (which is unlikely since it goes into the autotext), or you ended up getting in an argument and refusing to follow the rules? Or maybe some third, unusual case? I can't tell you how many times I went out of my way, even with combative, difficult posters, to get a post live again, and I was hardly extraordinary in that regard.\n\n&gt; Until then I will keep hoping that the subreddit fractures into multiple\n\nThere is absolutely nothing stopping you from starting your own competing sub-reddit, or operating out of the suite of other similar sub-reddits. But there's a reason why DPP is so much larger and more active than those others, and it has everything to do with the rules and moderation you're trying to tear down.\n\n&gt; I mean, you're a former mod and you tell me you like the current system? Don't you think that's a self-fulfilling prophecy? If you didn't like it, you would not have become a mod.\n\nAnother 'guess what' for you! No, I didn't agree on all of the rules, or how they were worded. And they knew that! And they knew that when I was brought on board! And I never felt it was held against me, just like I didn't hold it against them. I'd be surprised if there is ever 100% agreement (or even 80% agreement) on the rules in the mod team, except on this: Since we're all adults with a passion for the community, once the majority/leadership decision is made, we'll all enforce it the same way. Working through disagreements productively and working as a team even when we have different agendas is how adults behave.\n\n&gt;  I have gotten threatened by mods here in the recent past that they will watch me with great scrutiny.\n\nHow is this subjectivity? This is the proper response to anyone who, after understanding the rules, continues to chafe against them and/or violate them. What would you want them to do in that situation? Say, \"Oh, you're a special case, Lana. You get to go ahead and post whatever even if it's against the rules.\" *That* would be subjectivity.\n\nAnd you notice how this argument you've made not only wasn't deleted by the mods, but wasn't even refuted? That's because they *encourage* people to speak their minds if it's in a polite, constructive way, whether or not they agree with it. It wouldn't have mattered a hill of beans if you'd done it under your other account or not.\n\nBut as a non-mod, I'm afforded the exact same platform to let you know that you're still completely wrong.",
