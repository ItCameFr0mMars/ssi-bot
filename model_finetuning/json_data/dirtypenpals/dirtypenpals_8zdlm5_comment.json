As I became sexually more experience I never thought I was big, but I did not realize I was small until I was about 28, though a few comments stood out in hindsight. \n\nOne girl said she was used to he ex's really big penis. Another girl asked me why I was so confident in bed. Another told me she masturbated with a cucumber that was significantly larger than me.\n\nBut I did not really think too much about it until a girl I was flirting with said she knew I had a small dick, but that's ok she hated big ones. I ask how she knew, she said she could tell by looking, and also the way I carried myself. She took it out and called it cute.\n\nAnother girl was genuinely surprised.  She actually said \"does it get longer or thicker?\" when she first saw it.\n  \nThese started me down a path to enjoying small penis humiliation. \nI have had several women sort of tease me about it over the years, and I have happily accepted that my dick is small, but it works, and has satisfied enough women that I know it works well enough if you can work magic with your hands and mouth.
