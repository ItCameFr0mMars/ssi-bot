And as for the birthday change-up, I'd make mine a month or two earlier than it already is; it's in the fall, but I want to put a little more distance between it and the holidays.\n\nA party with a twist, huh? Maybe a little genital jamboree where someone forget to bring condoms?\n\nNow as for promotions, I do happen to have a prompt I want to thrust into the public eye.

I guess I'm here to throw myself out there a little more, and to see what sorts of fun we can come up with.\n\n My favorite present... well, that's a hard toss-up. One is a stuffed toy, bought for me by an Aunt for my first Birthday, which I named Daisy. Daisy Dog. I've still got her somewhere in my room. The other would be the christmas I get my first Xbox 360. Times were pretty tough, and while I'd asked for just an original Xbox, the exctatic happiness I'd felt... damn, still brings a tear to my eye thinking of it.\n\n I quite like my birthday where it is to be honest. Middle of summer, where nothing's going on... hmm, maybe a few weeks earlier so I could've celebrated it in school, but aside from that I'm happy with it. And come on, I share it with Gary Gygax and Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau. That's pretty cool, no?\n\n As for Part twists... I'd low-key love it if a party went from the typical music and beer to something ridiculously Nerdy. Like having a DnD one-shot party. When a character dies, someone tags in to fight. Something stupidly fun to do when ridiculously drunk.\n\n And at the moment no prompts to promote in particular, but if someone wants to go scan my old ones and see if there's something that piques their fancy, then let me know. I'm sure that there might be something someone likes.",

Ruddy-faced and shivering despite the alcohol in their veins, nine friends stood atop a tenement building in Queens and watched as the sky transformed into a beautiful tableau of colors and sound, each grandiose display of fireworks eliciting an 'ooh' or 'aah' from their small gathering. Vanessa, having drained her glass too quickly, turned her head to look for the bottle, and saw John and Mary snuggled up against a large air vent, their faces pressed together in a deep, passionate kiss. Vanessa smiled; those two had been eyeing each other for the better part of four months, and she was glad to see them finally move beyond their respective nervousness and simply embrace the moment - and each other - under the fire-laced winter sky. Deftly, the tall brunette picked up the champagne from a chair behind her and refilled her glass. Then she passed the bottle to Marcus on her right, who smiled his usual, cryptic smile at her.\n\n\"Man, they really went all out this year, huh?\"\n\nVanessa smiled and nodded, her eyes drifting back up to the open sky where the cascading showers of blue and red and yellow and green sparked and faded into nothingness, over and over and over again. It was beautiful, and it induced in Vanessa, as it always did, a sense of melancholy, an introspective quiet that made her reflect on the past, on her life, and on the wonderful people around her. Marcus, tall and dark and handsome. Aron and his wife Ellie. Jimmy, with his arm around Steven, the two of them swaying slightly as they hummed a faint melody together. And Lizah, whose nose was already buried in her phone again, undoubtedly uploading a selfie or searching for the best new year's party in the city. Vanessa smiled to herself and sipped the cool, bitter wine. Life was good. Jumbled and tangled and full of confusing elements, yes, but good. She had friends. She had wine. She was content.\n\nIn the far distance, half-hidden behind the sheath of fireworks raining over the city, another light rose, slower and more steady than the rest. From their vantage point, the group witnessed its regal ascent into the sky, and everyone was just about to comment on it when it, too, exploded, a bright spark of such unbearable intensity that everyone who beheld it shied away to cover their eyes, groaning and gasping with discomfort. For a split second, night was turned into day, and the fireworks were blotted out by the sudden eruption of a new, miniature sun. The light lingered, hovering in place as if it was somehow disobeying gravity through sheer force of incandescence, and then it resolved into a slowly expanding cloud, the mushroom shape pushing upwards and out as the ground began to quake.\n\nVanessa stared at the cloud. Next to her, Marco said something. A great roar began to fill her ears, as of a thousand horses charging in a stampede towards her. Marco repeated himself, more vigorously this time. He grabbed her arm. It was getting hard to think. Somewhere, someone was screaming.\n\nAnd then the screaming stopped.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Promotions!**\n\nI am generally overjoyed with the reception that my prompts get, but [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnAmazingFerret/comments/8hrpu1/prompt_horizontal_vertigo/) always felt like it could have done with a few more eyes on it. It's like a mix between Aeon Flux, Snow Crash and Neuromancer, and if you like latex bodysuits, chicks on motorcycles, high-speed danger and some dirty, dirty lovin', then I think you might like it. :D\n\nAside from that, pretty much everything that I write for DPP is over on my own sub, for those who wish to peruse. It's pretty lewd, though, so fair warning. ;D",

Whether it be my first hit where a prince of hell wishes for a cute girl to spend time with him, or a prompt entirely reliant on RNG- I've done it all!\n\nMy favorite present... That's actually pretty difficult. Though, I do think that anything by big sister has given me was always very appreciated. For those inclined to know what said presents were, think Warhammer models, video games, and the most important of all: heartfelt birthday cards that ~~totally dont make me tear up a little inside~~. I'm much more of a \"giver\" than a reciever however, and watching a person's eyes light up as you got them the *one* thing they always wanted is always fun.\n\nLast but not least; [here's a shameless plug](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8i6lye/m4farseer_in_the_grim_darkness_of_the_far_future/).\n\nHere's to writing more smut in the future, friends!",
