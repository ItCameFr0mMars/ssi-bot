I want to find a woman who I can rekindle my youthful eroticism I had for women(I still do) when I was younger.  \n\nThis prompt is about tits.\n\nAnd ass.\n\nAnd warm, wet places you can only get to if you're handsome and charming and... ok, maybe you just have to buy me a few drinks.\n\nThis is the prompt of a woman that just wants to be a girl again. Just wants to make you stiffer than her high school boyfriend the first time he took her bra off.\n\n- I would love to play off your description and begin by meeting you at a business conference. As I walk through the convention lobby, my focus on my phone call, through the corner of my eye I see this striking young woman sitting on a table near the bar.  I take a cursory glance towards her and as timing would have it, she says a glimpse of me as well. I look at her while smiling half expecting nothing in return. To my astonishment she gives a sensual smile back to me. As I start to think of my approach to talk to her, I am pulled away by my colleagues.......... will I see her later....I sure hope so. ",
