I haven't looked to get actual numbers, but I'd say I only get a response from somewhere around 1 in 10 of the people I PM in reply to their prompt.\n\nI am looking to play male characters, and I know that's the more common thing here, so I'm not entirely surprised.  I just wondered if it was normal, or if there was something I could adjust in my responses that would increase the likelihood of a successful RP starting.  I'm used to having more feedback than, essentially, throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks.  It's hard working without feedback.",

You need to set yourself apart. Honestly maybe it's partially the title game but I know that many ladies won't even open the one liners. I'm not saying that's what you're writing but I'm simply saying that actual content in your message is just as important. Title gets you in the door but the content is what will draw a genuine response. \n\nEveryone who messages after reading a prompt obviously liked the prompt. It's okay (even encouraged) to say that you enjoy the prompt. But that's surface level stuff. Everyone who responded enjoyed it. Let them know why. Maybe it's the titillating detail or the pace that they progressed the story. Maybe the way the drew the reader in with character development and world building. Intelligent messages get intelligent replies. \n\nThat's all good and well but that writer is then going to wonder how your input could add to their story. What can you bring to the table? What sets you apart from every other thirsty dude she got a message from? Your skills. Your creativity. Your nuanced writing style. IDK. What makes you a special butterfly? \n\nThen you're in the thick of it, right? You're feeling good about your reply but you still need *something else*. Where do you think you'd take the story? Here's where you show that you actually read their words and were 'inspired' to reply. Where did your mind see the characters going after the original post ended? \n\n\nAfter you send that message you'll think of a hundred other things to include but none of that matters. You put yourself out there and sending another message right away is needy and clingy and annoying. Don't do that. Just chill. Play it cool. Wait for a reply. \n\n\nIt's easy to list this stuff off, maybe even easy to follow the instructions provided here but what it comes down to partially has to do with luck. There's lots of male talent out there too. Maybe she got a better message three minutes before yours. Maybe she hasn't gotten anything more than one liners. There's no way to know. Just find comfort in knowing that you took your shot, you put in the effort and it'll be that much easier the next time. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take, right? \n\n\nTldr; put in effort and accept that rejection (or no reply) isn't failure. ",

Just send a line of dialogue and possibly throw in a bit of action. \n\nIt becomes trickier when you are doing longer responses, less often. People who like long responses tend to do better (in my experience) when they are willing to give up a little control of their character. It becomes so much easier when you can write in 3rd person and both control the characters.

For example, I posed a glory hole rp post, and it got a good amount of responses, around 12. Of those, 4 had anything to do with glory holes, and only two of them weren\u2019t a one liner that was \u201cglory holes are hot\u201d. One of those two clearly didn\u2019t read my kinklist either.\n\nMy weirder threads also often don\u2019t get almost any attention; for example, I struck out completely on my brothel of the Gods post *twice*.\n\nAnd I besides, women deal with a decent amount of rejection here too, plenty of dudes who post rp threads that are well written or interesting are just as picky as women, but male posters here don\u2019t realize it because they don\u2019t message them.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a quantity imbalance; there definitely is, and it\u2019s easier to be a woman here than a man. On the flip side, in my experience, many interactions here with men can be tinged with me being just a conduit for them to project their fantasies, with them taking control of my characters and such. That\u2019s lead me to be a lot pickier and do more vetting before I\u2019ll start something with someone. \n\nI\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t know what the quality of some women posters are; even though I post F4A, my respondents have almost always been men. It\u2019s perfectly possible that women are the same as men here, on balance, I\u2019ve just never met them.",
