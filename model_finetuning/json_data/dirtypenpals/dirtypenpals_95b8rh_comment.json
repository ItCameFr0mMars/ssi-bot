And there's this fucking MeToo thing.  \n\nME TOO! I WANT YOU!  I want us to break a bed together... I want to taste every inch of you!  I'm bored with going to the local Yo branch alone - sat alone at the belt.  I have always fantasised about... you going commando - grinding down on me - us fucking in a sushi joint while feeding each other sushi from the belts.. opening that top of yours - drinking sake from your tits... I want my cock to be yours - regardless of what anyone says.\n\nI grew up watching old John Landis films where this dynamic was OK...  but even proposing a transfer of pastoral cover seems to be precluded under all the safeguarding rules... Safeguarding what, precisely?  MAssive frustration due to some power and agency calculus - which does legitimately need to be there to head off the Poldark assholes...?\n\nWe bonded over some of those deep discussions... and you don't see me going home and fuckign my fist wishing I was deep inside you... how I woudl want you as my lunch - put you on my desk and graze at your maddeningly tasty pussy... the tension is always there...\n\n\nhow my dick is achingly hard - which is why I have to sit alone for a long time after bidding you goodbye...\n\nand FUCK these speech codes!  I want you.\n\nBut there's ALWAYS been that taboo!  Abba, The Police and the Boomtown Rats wrote about it - when safrguarding rules stopped at 19.  \n\nBut I'm your sysadmin and staff... \n\nThe epithet of \"creep\" was always there - even back when Lucy May Alcott wrote it into the Green Gables series...  \n\nIs ti possible to arrange a transfer of duties?  We talked about voluntary stuff we did - and we locked on to how you're in the St John Amb LINKS unit (or crossPond equivalent)... and I was heavily active at the ball duties - the same ones you work at - looking after the Balls Soc/sorority socialites like I used to back in the 90s.. the college balls I worked at - the same scrupulosity there.. \n\nEven there - fucking CRB!  But in that role we'd be equal.. but it's confusing what ruleset applies where now...\n\n\"Breasts are not sexual!\"  Like fuck they're not!  \n\nI want you.  Fucking hate that there's a shit-ton of paperwork in the way... when I want us to put the room to bed - then fuck you senseless... after every session - every seminar... \n\nOr are we \"harassing\" each other?  Or is that some busybody butting in?  Even blowjobs under lecterns are beign recoded as \"rape\" - Police Academy and Breakfast Club already casualties... \n\nI'm as frustrated as you.\n\n(end characterisation)",
