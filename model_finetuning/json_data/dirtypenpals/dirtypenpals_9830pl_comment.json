(Apart from the sex scenes! - Unless you want to write comical smut!)\n\nDo shitposts qualify as comedy? If so, yes.\n\n&gt; If you read posts which are shares, do you only read in your preferred tag, [M4F] say?\n\nWhy would that make a difference? If I am heterosexual, I can enjoy both M4F and F4M SHARES, they have both perspectives after all. Or am I getting you wrong? For bisexuals, it is even easier... at least in my opinion, and I guess homosexual people aren't that much into heterosexual stories, but who knows? I have some lesbian friends that have read 50 Shades of Grey, which is totally a scientific thing to base this argument on.\n\nThis all comes down to \"people are different\", but I read all the SHARES I can find.\n\n&gt; Think of a writing partner where the RP went well (whether it was a sex scene (or 3!) or a longer-term RP with some story and plot) and you liked their writing and found it erotic and horny to read. Without naming them, briefly explain what it was about their writing that made it work so well.\n\nEffort goes a long way. The best roleplays I played were suuuper long in terms of response length, and that just was a big turn-on for me. If there is detail, emotion, more than just a description of actions, I am a happy gal.\n\n&gt; Commenting on here seems pretty minimal, do you ever comment on a post?\n\nThe comment sections of my posts are often more fun than my inbox. If it is not an \"I messaged you check your inbox\", commenting can be a cool thing. But it really depends on what you are writing. Don't criticize someone under their prompt, that's just a dickmove :D",

The Victorian sex farce went nowhere, but it is still one of my favorite prompts. My Suburban Tarzan one was kinda an exercise...\n\n&gt; If you read posts which are shares, do you only read in your preferred tag, [M4F] say?\n\nNo, I read anything which catches my attention. I also read the tags on mattresses if nothing else is available to read.\n \n&gt; Think of a writing partner where the RP went well (whether it was a sex scene (or 3!) or a longer-term RP with some story and plot) and you liked their writing and found it erotic and horny to read. Without naming them, briefly explain what it was about their writing that made it work so well.\n\nCommunication and understanding what appealed to each other.\n\n&gt; Commenting on here seems pretty minimal, do you ever comment on a post? How do you see commenting on here?\n\nI'm in favor of it. I swap dirty limericks in comments, sometimes. It's a shameful but compulsive behavior.\n",

When they either seem really weird or really clever.\n\n&gt;Have you ever written a comedy RP? (Apart from the sex scenes! - Unless you want to write comical smut!)\n\nI've written not-so-much-RPs heavy on the comedy side, in a feeble attempt to get someone's interest through this cheap gimmick. As in, asking people to have sexy chat with me in a way i find funny (like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/988eh3/34m4f_quick_dirty_and_to_the_point/)). When i'm bored sometimes i'll send silly responses to people to try and make them smile with no hopes of a reply. I clearly remember someone writing a prompt asking to be degraded, and sending them a response of a description, in vivid detail, of me tying them up in front of a TV and playing an episode of Friends to them. They replied \"hey, i didn't ask to be tortured\", which made me chuckle. A brief exchange among 2 kinky DPPs, sharing a moment of humor in a sea of sex.\n\n&gt;If you read posts which are shares, do you only read in your preferred tag, \\[M4F\\] say?\n\nYes, only F4M.\n\n&gt;Think of a writing partner where the RP went well (whether it was a sex scene (or 3!) or a longer-term RP with some story and plot) and you liked their writing and found it erotic and horny to read. Without naming them, briefly explain what it was about their writing that made it work so well.\n\nIt was a delightful role play about a fantasy setting with mind control involved. She paid attention to detail, painted a beautifully descriptive and rich picture in every paragraph she wrote, and kept making references to earlier moments of the RP. She had a remarkable vocabulary and immersed you in the three key elements of any RP.- What what happening in her character's environment, what her character was thinking and feeling and what her character was doing. She had a great knack for taking whatever i wrote and giving it an unexpected twist, working over it or leading it somewhere that would add to the plot. I can honestly say she was out of my RP league and deserves only the craziest of orgasms for her amazing writing skills.\n\n&gt;Commenting on here seems pretty minimal, do you ever comment on a post?\n\nOnly very once in a while and if i think i have something really funny to say. I usually delete them after a while.",
