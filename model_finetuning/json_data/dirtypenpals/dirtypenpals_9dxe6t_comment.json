I see there is a new workshop subreddit - does this replace the old Tinkering sub? Just curious. \n\nConsidered starting fresh with a new account or pruning some of the old prompts from this one, reworking them. Just curious how much importance people place on responding to a profile which has a few years and a post history on it vs replying to a newer account. \n\nOtherwise, I think it is good to be back.",

It used to be that I'd have 3-4 posts to consider responding to. These days it's 1 at best, but often there aren't any posts that tickle me.\n\nThis isn't to yuck on anyone's yums. I want people to like what they're going to like. It just seems like there's an overabundance of intensely negative posts and I'm curious if I'm the only one seeing it. Cuckolding is kind of a trigger for me, so I try to filter those posts, but that's tough since we're pretty open with post titles aside from the gender tagging. I personally come here to try to connect with people over kinks and have some safe fun roleplaying things. Lately though, I leave feeling isolated.\n\nAgain, if above is one of your things, this isn't me trying to call you out individually. It's more about what feels like a wave of this stuff.",

After all, it is through writing that you can explore things that are far beyond your capacity or capability in your 'normal' life. Cuckolding and Non-Con are typically fantasies that are potentially dangerous or harmful, mentally, physically or even in terms of constituent relationships, to play out in that 'other' life - but in the written realm, they are often easier to experience, freer of baggage and potential consequence, and most importantly controllable in many of their aspects. I posit that there isn't a huge realm of difference between a cuckolding prompt and a spellcasting romp into a fantasy world - aside from the potentially triggering elements of the former., perhaps. \n\nI've written in defense of vanilla posts in the past and indeed I maintain that there is nothing inherently wrong with enjoying romance, easy casual sex between friends, or anything else that may fall away from the purview of 'vanilla'. That said, I would suggest you not think of the particular kinks you've listed as 'negative' (or deviant, or non-vanilla, or chocolate for that matter), but rather alternative fantasies that these writers are seeking a safe outlet to explore in the written medium. Individuals want to explore their fantasies and writing is often a safer, more controlled way of doing just that.",

The celebs thing is I guess not really germane to that, they just seem even more common than usual lately. And I realize that not everyone is going to come at the idea of fantasy from the same place - for some people exploring pain seems to be how they approach that. That's fine.\n\nWhat I'm saying, though, is that there's an overabundance of those posts. The sub feels like it went from having a few posts \"for me\" here and there to having *almost none* that I can access. I can't handle the idea of sexual violence beyond some spanking. The idea of participating in a cuckold play makes me feel a little sick to my stomach. \n\nAnd sure, when I don't see any for me, I try to put up a post, but the male poster problem still exists as it always has - We get almost no responses, and when we do, they're often lazy replies like \"hey i liked your post.\" Which, obviously, the women have to endure far more of. I wouldn't want to trade places, believe me.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that I don't understand why people like that stuff. I get that there are reasons people might want to roleplay those kinks. I'm saying that there's a huge amount of posts specifically for these kinks lately, and that, in the 3-4 years I've been here, it hasn't previously seemed like that.\n\nI would also say that, from my perspective personally, there's a huge difference between a prompt centered around magic spells and one around cuckolding. Magic is purely fantasy for all parties involved unless there's something happening that I don't know about. Cuckolding, meanwhile, is a real thing that happens to real people and destroys real relationships. In that both posts come from the place of a person wanting to try something they don't have in real life, sure, they're identical, and every post on DPP is identical in that way. But I think they're quite different for the reason listed above. Again, that's not to say \"don't play this\" to the people that enjoy that fantasy. There have always been some posts like that around DPP, and that's great. There's definitely an audience for it. But these days it seems like that's all that's out there at any given hour.",

Perhaps in this specific subreddit, the popularity of prompts more to your tastes have waned as the writers that catered to them found long term partners, moved on, or stopped writing for whatever reason. \n\nAs such, given the winds of change, there may come a day in which there will be more writers that are of a mind with you are posting with regularity - the only real thing you can do is keep posting what you enjoy and hope that someone who agrees stumbles into you.\n\nI also mildly disagree with the notion of 'male poster' drought. While I don't doubt that \"F4\" posters are getting a significant quantity of replies to a well-written prompt, I haven't had any specific trouble myself with my own writing - and I post as Male.\n\nI also feel like the distinction you've made with cuckolding as an example is a little arbitrary. Sure - *magic* as it exists in fantasy may not exist, but swords, weapons, mind control, brainwashing, and other themes or motifs have existed in our world, affected real people and suchlike. Where is the line drawn, then? I don't mean to call you out or anything, just pointing out that if we stuck to ideas that never affected anyone in the 'real world' we'd be pretty pressed for interesting ideas for prompts. ",

But, yeah, it means that our prompt visibility takes a hit.  \n\nKeep in mind that it will always be that way.  And you have zero control over it.  Well, you could make multiple accounts.  In the past I've had multiple accounts and I had, in the past, upvoted a prompt or two (maybe five).  But I also learned that the Eye of Reddit can see patterns and/or you can be reported (whereupon you have a better chance of being seen by the Eye).  I had one account suspended for suspected vote manipulation and then, in short succession, lost them all.  Permanently.  And if I tried to create a new account - it died just as quick a death.\n\nSo I don't do that anymore.  I write my prompt, place it into the bottle and throw it into the \"DPP Shoppe of Curiosities\" that is this place.  Maybe it lands in a visible spot and people pick it up and look at it and then put it back down. Most likely it will be buried quickly, otherwise it will just be buried. ",
