I grew up on Usenet and 4chan so this is making me facepalm pretty hard. :P\n\nFirst crush is going to be about as vanilla as possible: a girl I knew at school. She was smart (really smart), snarky, cute, and of course wanted nothing to do with me. We scored roughly similarly on standardized tests, we could run around the same speed. I specifically remember one incident where she did a bit better than I did on a math test. This was... surprisingly... formative of my taste in girls, now that I think about it.\n\nMy favorite word, at least in the context of *this* sub, would have to be *obsequious*. It's a delightful word to write, it sounds alluring, it's Latinate (of course), and it's got viscerally pleasing mouthfeel. /sikwi/ is not a common form in English. The two /i/s, the /s/ followed by /kwi/, just all of it. It sounds like it should describe a delicacy--and it does, in a way!\n\nWhy launch the dildo when I can just wave it at the dragon? Sure, doing ballistics calculations is fun, but the engineer in me is thinking about efficiency here. Furthermore, any 90 kg dildo suitable for use by a dragon could very easily be misconstrued as a weapon (in conventional form, a dildo rather resembles a missile), and I'd rather not be on a sex-starved dragon's bad side. A horngry dragon is as bad as an angry dragon, and in this case I don't have a paladin to outrun, not even a hobbit.\n\nMy favorite thing to cry out during sex are words of power that bend reality to my will.\n\nMy mother's maiden name is \ud83d\udd95 and the last four digits of my credit card are \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9.\n\nMultiple parse errors near `whom'st'd've the fucc eat ass`.\n\nAs for prompts I've not had the chance to play yet, since I've not played any, that's an infinite set in that it encompassess all prompts. But it's also a null set from the perspective of it as the subset of prompts I have but which I haven't had success with yet. I may have a thing for set theory and cardinality. Read my father's copy of *Infinity and the Mind* when I was ~15 and it bent my mind in the most wonderful ways.",

The 80s was an interesting time in cartoons.\n\n - What is your favorite word, and why is it 'succulent'?\n\nI like \"moist\" better.  I kinda feel like moist divides the world into two parts, the ones who find the word icky, and the ones who find it sexy.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of in-between.\n\n - What would you use to launch a 90 kg dildo at a sex-starved dragon 300m away?\n\nA trebuchet, duh.  None of those inferior siege weapons.\n\n - What is your favorite thing to cry out during sex?\n\nIf I looked at my RPs it's probably \"fuck\" or \"oh, God\".  But reading this I was just thinking of \"cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war\".  Because reasons.\n\n - Lmao whom'st'd've the fucc eat ass?!?\n\nI'd.

Now that I think of it - it probably didn't resemble anything like I remember it.\n\n&gt;What is your favorite word, and why is it 'succulent'?\n\nNow.  It just packs it all together.  Immediate.  You can yell it, say it, whisper it.  It can be command or a question.  Three letters.  Big bang for your buck.  Easy to spell, too.\n\n&gt;What would you use to launch a 90 kg dildo at a sex-starved dragon 300m away?\n\nI'd rather attach it to the ground for two reasons.  First, it, hopefully, will keep the dragon in one location.  Two, it would probably be funny to see that giant thing wiggle and wobble about.\n\n&gt;What is your favorite thing to cry out during sex?\n\nSee above, now.\n\n&gt;What is your mother's maiden name, and the last four digits of your credit card?\n\n[redacted]\n\n&gt;Lmao whom'st'd've the fucc eat ass?!?\n\nThis probably would get more upvotes than me. lol\n\n[Tell me about Mike](https://redd.it/9dfms2)\n\nIs one that I've been most happy with because I think I managed to keep it open ended enough and there's a story in there.",
