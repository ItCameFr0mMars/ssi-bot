He\u2019s a lawful evil human wizard (enchanter), 4th son of a minor noble with no inheritance, he was raised with high expectations but little attention and support, and for lack of better options joined the church of Pelor at a young age and studied to become a cleric, a pursuit he was wholly unsuited for.  Eizer was acting out (cruel pranks and harsh criticism of peers and teachers he found boring) and was on the brink of being expelled from the church when he discovered an old tome locked away in a secured room within the library.  This tome was the journal and spellbook of an ancient wizard, who believed that the gods were not all powerful benefactors, but rather emotional leeches who syphoned their enormous strength from the belief of their followers, and sought to do the same through arcane magic.  Alongside his history and ranting the ancient wizard left both arcane instruction specializing in the twisting of minds and emotions, and mundane instruction to do the same through physical, emotional, and linguisitic manipulation.  Eizer embraced this worldview and found himself as gifted a student in all the wizard\u2019s teachings as he was ill suited for all his divine pursuits.  Eizer didn\u2019t just learn though, he used his newfound talents to turn the tables on his peers and instructors, first subtly learning to manipulate them, then practicing more invasive coercion, and finally through repeated charming (and in some cases seduction) mentally breaking both pious peers and instructors he once found irksome.  Eizer soon grew bored of his church, and set off with his most \u2018faithful\u2019 companions in search of greater challenges and rewards.\n\nEizer is tall (6\u20193\u201d), lean and golden haired with piercing, sneering hazel eyes.  He is in his mid 20s, clever and extremely handsome (and for the purposes of your game, gifted with a girthy 11 inch cock and a master\u2019s grasp of how to manipulate a woman\u2019s body, while controlling his own) He claims to be a \u2018humble\u2019 priest of Pelor, and is a verbose flatterer or everyone he meets worth talking to, but he seems always on the brink of letting everyone in on the joke, as his pompous body language and cruel wit bely his true nature, as do the priest and priestesses he travels with, whose devotion to him (and his comfort in using them in ways no self respecting person would oblige) is somewhat disturbing to most observers.  It\u2019s a testament to his charm and skill that he isn\u2019t questioned more about them.\n\n(In 5e he had the noble background feature of 3 NPC retainers, modified as mindbroken slaves rather than family servants, so they would follow orders unquestioningly but had severe penalties to perception and had no normal human initiative if not instructed by Eizer to act.  They\u2019re not necessary for your game, whatever you choose, but treating them like furniture and doing all kinds of weird shit with them was how I had my fun in normal DND.). Eizer is power hungry and ambitious and loves nothing more than breaking down and controlling others, either by coercion, seduction, magical, or physical force.\n\nAlternately, if Eizer is a bit much I have some other ideas.",
