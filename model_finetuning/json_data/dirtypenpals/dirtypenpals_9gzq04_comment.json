            "body": "I find it interesting how this question received (so far) three vehement but *entirely* opposing answers. So, for the question-asker, if it isn't already obvious, I would say it is something that isn't really settled and clear on DPP. Which yes, can be very frustrating and hard to navigate.\n\nIt's not against the rules to take on a role and hide who you actually are. It's kind of just left up to people to decide for themselves. Some writers do not care at all who you are in real life, but others will be unhappy and feel manipulated if you don't tell them.\n\nIn part it depends on the kind of scene and the kind of conversation. Like, if you're writing as tentacled space creature in an obviously fictional scenario, then probably nobody is going to care about your actual gender. However if you're sharing your feelings about your high-school crushes and your favorite authors etc., and getting to know someone like that, then the situation is different and people will probably be more upset to find out that you have significantly mis-represented who you really are.\n\nIn my opinion, given the current situation and different feelings, the best and most ethical solution is just to say up front when you are playing a role. You don't actually have to say anything about who you really are if you don't want to, but instead just indicate if the character you are writing is *not* who you really are. That way nobody will be confused or misled. So:\n\n(3)  Say, \"Hey there, I'd love to play as the 18 year old girl you're looking for! I would picture myself in this scene as 5 ft tall, blonde, and completely innocent. I look up at you tearfully, begging you not to hurt me any more ....\"\n\nSee, that way you don't have to bring in all this real-life stuff at all, like \"I'm a 40-year old man,\" etc. But at the same time, you can also be clear that the other person should understand this is a fictional character writing, rather than an actual real-life young female pen pal.\n\nI know it's kind of complicated, but given all the very different assumptions and approaches that different people have on DPP, I think that is probably the best way to be clear about it.",
