I got into a rut for awhile with punishments though. After talking we  landed on choking. So now, when she misbehaves I will use my body to hold her down and wrap my fingers around her neck. I prefer blood chokes to wind chokes since I think they are easier to control. Then I will have her hold eye contact with me while I choke and fuck her. If she looks away or closed her eyes for more than a blink I slap her and warn her not to take her eyes off of me. Needless to say we both get off super hard on this.",
