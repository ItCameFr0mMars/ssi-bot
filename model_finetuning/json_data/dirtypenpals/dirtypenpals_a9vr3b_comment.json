Example when I\u2019m in a sauna I just sit nude on a towel, if it\u2019s an all male sauna, same with the spa in the hot tubs and cold tubs it\u2019s a no clothing zone.  Locker room is the same everyone is in there to change, and we all have the same body parts so no big deal. I have changed in front of my friends before it doesn\u2019t make anyone uncomfortable, even on a rode trip with him stuck in traffic we had to whip it out to pee in a cup so nudity isn\u2019t a big deal.",
