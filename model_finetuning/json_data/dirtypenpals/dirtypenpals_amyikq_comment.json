Not to mention, you imply that white women can't be attracted to black men, and only get with them to spite their parents?\n\nSo you're angry about racism, and you think the best way to show that is to spew racism?\n\nLook, I'm not even defending OP. Insulting all white men is definitely a racist thing to do. But one person being racist doesn't make it okay for other people to be racist.\n\n(And the fact that you even *considered* calling him a spear chucker or a \"fucking monkey\" just proves that you're a racist piece of garbage.)\n\nNot to mention the fact that I only commented on how easy it is to understand your comment (spoiler alert: it's not), but your immediate reaction was to start lecturing me about black people and politics, and to tell me to go fuck myself.\n\nYou're either a troll, or just very inflammatory.
