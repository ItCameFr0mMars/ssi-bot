My sexual awakening, as it were, was finding a photo album my father had under his bed of her.  The weirdest thing is that I used to take pictures from it and no one ever said anything about it.  As a 15 year old, it seemed like a perfectly reasonable crime, as a 35 year old, it would be obvious to me what was happening...  Anyway, I was too young and green to ever make the first move, but I still get aroused wondering what could have happened if she had so much as kissed my on the lips one late night when my father was out, or sleeping.  Maybe these things work out better as fantasies, maybe you should give him a small opening and see what happens?  Legality is so strange, I mean, we speed, we skim, and when given just about any opportunity, we take it.  You'll have to go with whatever you can live with.  You make me curious though, did my step mother know what I was up to and cover it up for me, getting herself off knowing I was jerking off to those pictures?  It's strangely exciting to think about.",

            "body": "Being a mom myself, I suppose I can sort of relate? So assuming you'd follow this urge, how can you be certain that he doesn't have a different agenda? Or none at all? Looking at someone physically and being aroused by that is one thing, acting on that is a different story. I am not only talking about you, but also him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're willing to eventually confront him (or not, your choice), you could set him up. Wear nice panties, a robe and watch TV with him, preferably a movie that'll invite cuddling and see what he does. If he comes snuggling, you can let him peek the panties and/or breasts. That's probably what I'd do, test him in a controlled environment, and then take up all my courage and talk to him about intentions and boundaries. The biggest choice you need to make is about your endgame, a ruleset that you are okay with, no matter what happens.\n\nBut even if I can understand the appeal of being intimate with your kid, I would never go this far. Life will punish him later one way or another. That's what I believe happens when you mess with a natural order that growing kids need to follow. (No I don't necessarily agree with that natural order, but I believe growing kids needs to follow the same set of rules that their social circle in the widest sense has, or there will be consequences)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd since I have a very sick mind, I could totally enjoy having him peek in on me showering, changing, stealing underwear (which I'd steal back and ponder about wearing them a second time), only him watching me sleep would creep me out. I'd love that. Though I see, that last part doesn't help you the least.",
