Personally I would find it gratifying (and kind of sweet?) if one of my partners was enjoying our exchange so much that they repackaged the ideas and thoughts and dangled it looking for a proxy-me to have more fun with.\n\nI guess part of it would depend on - if I felt like I had a real connection and/or relationship here with someone, maybe that would change my mind a bit - but we're all just firing words off into the void, here.  Why not get the maximal amount of fun out of those words, even if the creator isn't there to enjoy them anymore?",

There are two reasons why we end up on this subreddit:\n\n1. Looking for a longterm partner to build a connection with in terms of sexual compatibility, writing style, and timing, or\n2. Looking for a short term partner to co-write with until one or both partners are satisfied.\n\nIf it is the second scenario and if the idea is non-unique, give it a few days after the initial posting or deletion and then go for it. The partnership ran its course and the content would probably have occurred in some iteration anyways. \n\nIf it is the first scenario, I would want to explore an adjacent scenario to the one that I created with the partner. If it's something long term, then both of you put ownership into creating a world together that you both benefited from. Rehashing the original idea with a new partner can be fun, but a verbatim rehash will either become mechanical or boring. More likely, the original idea--with a new long-term partner--will form into something new that wasn't conceptualized before. So, why not start with a spin on the idea and see where it goes?\n\nFinally, ideas allow for a first contact to find a potential partner. But you/we still have to have a partner accept the invitation, and you/we have to find a common scene for both/all parties to explore. That usually will make any scene into a unique one, and the issue of using an old idea becomes obsolete.\n\nTL;DR: respect yourself, your old partner, and your new partners. The process of forming a new scene will make most ideas unique. You're good. Separately, you're a good person because you care about your partners and the community/subreddit. ",
