Pulling talented writers from the main sub and giving them a place to interact with other talented writers seems like a good idea at face value. A more focused environment would be great but we must not forget that it would potentially pull good, creative content from the sub as a whole. There have been a few attempts to create an elite writing area \u2013 for lack of a better term. Eventually things grow stale or it becomes an ol' boys club that creates this holier-than-thou mentality by the people who 'get in'. \n\nDirty Story Writing already exists and is a great place for the same thing. It's been around a while and continues to see activity. You might pull activity from that sub as well. \n\nThe worst that you could do is try out the idea. If it flops, it flops. Maybe it'll flourish though. I'd probably be a participant either way (assuming I'd make the cut).",

Adding in writing smut together and the various expectations, ghostings and anti-climatic ends that so often occur in that endeavor often leads to a lot of hurt feelings and a potential breakdown in the community if core members are at each other's throats. The DPP IRC has a no partner seeking in chat rule, and I think it's to that particular chat room's benefit that the goal isn't to find people to write together but instead to, well, chat.\n\nI'd also like to add that Only_Writes_Smut is likely correct that adding an elitism to DPP is likely just going to lead to hurt feelings since there's no objective way to judge the merit of someone's writing quality and invariably people are going to get left out or the ones who *do* get in get snooty. As you say yourself, your 'vetting' is the only thing that's going to distinguish who gets to enter this elite chat room or not - and your opinion is going to be subjective by default.",
