For example cheating is a big kink of mine.\n\nSome things that make me skip a prompt:\n\n* Gangbangs (don't like em, meh)\n\n* those super extreme things like gore, vore, scat, monsters, animal, etc.\n\n* Prompts that say no limits.\n\n* Prompts where the person is obviously only interested in their own pleasure. This one manifests in a lot of ways but is usually very apparent.\n\n* Celebs (these ones usually fall under the previous point as well)\n\n* Prompts that have no real substance. ex. (I'm just looking to play a slut today, and that's basically all the say)\n\n--------------------------\n\nGood writers will usually have a prompt that has a fairly captivating story. As in they'll write the opener of their story in a very vivid manner.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAs a man I'll add that I don't respond to pm's from people that are 'female' and have a 1 month old account and just about no posts. Or if they do post they post on distinctly male subs, like T_D, NFL and gaming subs. One or two is fine but if it all looks like a dude, it's a no.\n\nSure we're just chatting/RPing here but if I post 4F I expect actual F not M playing as F. Anyone is allowed to deny you for any reason they want. They don't owe you anything.\n\n",

            "body": "I'm a guy who only responds to F4 posts.  Before I even message someone, I check through their profile to make sure I don't find anything that either reveals they're actually a guy or makes me question their gender, since I'm just not comfortable RPing with other dudes.  That said, I prefer to just let people message me in response to my prompts instead of messaging anyone else first.  Everyone wants responses that don't sound like copy+paste messages, but it sucks to spend a good chunk of time writing up a message to someone and then not getting a response back.  The only times I'll message someone first is if their post is very similar to something I'm looking for or if their prompt gives me a new RP idea that I would like to explore.\n\nI don't like prompts that are too long, but I also don't like prompts that don't give many details for what the person is looking for.  I don't bother reading prompts with titles that sound too generic and overdone.  I avoid prompts where the person starts off their RP and expects you to follow up with your first message, since I prefer to have some discussion beforehand.  I don't mind a few pics in a prompt, but too many pics can be annoying.  And maybe this is age-ist, but I also avoid prompts posted by anyone older than me.\n\nMatching kinks and limits is important.  I won't respond to someone whose prompt includes any of my limits and I'll also avoid anyone whose limits include too many of my kinks.  I also avoid prompts that focus heavily on a specific kink, even if it's a kink that I normally like, since I prefer a healthy variety to my lewdness.\n\nWhile I enjoy reading prompts that are well-written, I actually avoid responding to them.  RPing is just a hobby for me, and while I prefer to not RP with someone who's a lazy writer, I also avoid anyone who would put in way more effort than I would, since I would just feel bad for my partner.  I try my best to match my partner's response quality, so I won't message someone if I feel like a majority of my free time will be eaten up while trying to match their length or level of detail.\n\nAs for ghosting, I've only done that a very small handful of times.  I've been ghosted so often that it's something I try to avoid doing.  The only times I've ghosted someone where when they were seriously creeping me out and making me so uncomfortable that I just had to block them.",

I've had some bad experiences chatting.\n\nAre any of my turn-off's in the prompt? Some turn-off's are absolutely non-negotiable. Whereas if the post is really good and there's one minor thing I don't like, then I'll negotiate. Or maybe the person is willing to drop it altogether.\n\nI like longer prompts that give good description of what I'm about to get into. I'll still message a good post if it's short, but I'll ask clarifying questions that might not go anywhere because I find out that I'm not interested after getting more detail. \n\nPhotos can be hit or miss. If I get an image in my head from your writing, and the photo you provide is hotter than what I imagined, then it's great. If the photo isn't something I'm into, then it won't help any.\n\nA lazy writer is someone who doesn't advertise themselves. DPP is like a dating app in some ways. If you don't do what you can to show your strengths and have confidence in what you're putting out there, then it makes you look lazy or like you don't care. \n\nI've ghosted people before due to real life stuff happening. It sucks but it happens to everybody, both ghosting and being ghosted. But I'll tell the person if the story goes in a direction I don't want it to, or if I lose interest.\n\nA good writer has the ability to get their points across without relying on too many images, run on sentences, getting stuck in the weeds (too much detail), or relying on overbaked tropes. Basic storytelling techniques, you know. They have a decent balance of narration and dialogue. There's progression at a decent pace. They have good ideas and charisma in their writing. They know how to set the proper tone. It takes practice. I'm definitely still learning myself how to write effectively. But generally speaking, you know a good writer when you see one.",

Too short means they're not putting much effort into their prompt which means they're not going to put much effort into the roleplay. Too long means that they probably expect a lot from me. I'm sorry but I have a life, I can't send four paragraphs every time, and I'm not just going to add flavor text so it's long enough for you. Pictures can help draw me in but there have been a few times where they push me away because it's just so far away from what I imagine when I read the prompt. Obviously, just like most people, I look for kinks that I like and stay away from ones I don't like. If one of their limits is something I enjoy, I'm less likely to message. And if one of their kinks is a limit of mine, I'm less likely to message but if they include something like \"We don't have to include any of these if you don't want to\", it's probably not a problem. One thing that'll make it more likely I'll message them is if they include multiple ideas. If they only have one idea that they're set on and I don't enjoy it as much as I might enjoy something similar but different, I'm probably not going to message them. But if they include \"Feel free to send your own ideas\"... well, that's also a hit-or-miss because sometimes my idea will just be nothing like their prompt. Related to that, if someone makes a post about how they have no limits and they'll do anything, I'm not super likely to message them because a) it's so unspecific and honestly pretty lazy b) I'll probably decide that they won't like what I want to do and c) they probably get a ton of messages so I'll get ignored anyways. Something that helps me in my decision to message is the time frame and if there's any indication that they'll still be up for it. If the post includes something like \"I'll always be into this prompt, feel free to message no matter how long it's been\", it helps ease my worry that they won't respond because it's been weeks or months or whatever. When I decide to ghost someone, well, usually I just block them because I don't want to see \"Hello? Still there?\" all the time, it's because they don't put much effort or because I'm just not enjoying the roleplay anymore. ",

I've enjoyed super vanilla scenes because I liked the person. It comes down to rapport and style, I think.\n\nThe magic is someone who seems interested in telling a story. If the prompt makes me feel something, I'm probably going to take a shot at connecting with them.\n\nI try not to ghost, but it happens from time to time for personal reasons- it's not a reflection on my partner, though. And if we are friends, I won't vanish. I miss writing with several old partners, but I don't feel owed anything from anyone here. I'm grateful to meet and engage with the people I have partnered with. ",

Long, short, doesn't matter if it's a specific kink, a particular scene, a context, five miniature prompts, as long as it seems like they've put in a bit of thought into what they want. This is because if *they* know what they want, then I don't have to do the guessing for them. I find this is especially true because I like to play a Domme. If my partner is all tied up and gagged, then if they don't add anything other than reactions it's just going to be *my* kinks and what *I* like, which goes against the whole point of writing with another person. \n\nOf course, there's no hard and fast rule. A lazy writer could say 'I want [blank]', and then expect you to spoonfeed it to them, whereas a good writer could say 'You know, I'm not sure what I want, but message me and we can talk something out!'. I think if you discuss before jumping in to the deep end, you're more likely to get what you both want in the long term. \n\nWhich brings me to the next point: If you have a kinklist, or a list of kinks, or are able to communicate what gets you ticking, it makes it easier for me to know where your boundaries are and where you're sitting. I've had some prompts that are centered around, say, pregnancy, and then clicked on a kinklist with a big red **no** next to pregnancy. (???? pls )\n\n\nAlso ghosting for me is a hard no.  I'd rather tell someone 'Hey, sorry I don't think it's really working for me anymore' then just disappear in to the void *I'm looking at you, [deleted]*. I know how it feels to be on the other end of a ghost, and it's just straight rude. Granted, I know some people and also be a little difficult if you tell them you don't want to continue, but que sera sera. I admit that because my first language is not English and I'm still working on my writing skills, that I find it difficult to put a story down the way I see it in my head. It's one of the reasons  I started RPing to begin with,  but I can tell when something just isn't working out -- at that point, it's better to leave amicably. \n\n\nLast by not least, I think part of what makes me message someone is just that something *clicks*. I usually read prompts on my phone, saving the ones that I think I'll go back to, then after work I'll go through a bit more and message the ones I think have potential. That's plenty of time for me to sit on a prompt, think about whether I like it enough to reach out *and play it*. \n\nHope that answers your question, OP!",

I filter out M4/A4/NB4/T4 posts because I know I don't want to play with those people. \n\n2. Account is not brand new. [deleted] is the least sexy thing on DPP, and an account created in the last ~20 days is ripe for deletion, especially if they post something really depraved, because there's a good chance they're going to regret it as soon as they get off, or whatever.\n\n3. Eye-catching title. It should show some interest in grammar/english/writing. \"F4M some various prompts\" or \"F4M daddy/daughter fun :)\" are boring. It should hint at an intriguing story idea, at something more than a quick cyber session.\n\n3. Good grammar, use of paragraphs. These prove to me that you're at a computer, not using a phone to type. Even the best phone typists can't match someone using a keyboard, in my experience, and phone players are looking for fast, short fun.\n\n4. Clear expectations of communication.\n\n5. Matching kinks!\n\n5. Willingness to discuss the story before diving in.\n\n\nThese are not guidelines that will work for everyone. Some people want quick and dirty. Some people want to dive in and pretend like i'm actually their brother rather than to write a story about their brother. Some people don't care what my actual gender is. Those are all fine, but they're not for me.",
