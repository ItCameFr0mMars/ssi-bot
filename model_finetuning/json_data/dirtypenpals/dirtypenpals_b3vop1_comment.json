She was cute, and I'm typically more of a boob guy if anything, but when she turned around and happened to bend over in front of me, I lost my mind. Her ass...wow.\n\n\nI think about her occasionally and I know it's because of a few things:\n\n\n- She was looking for attention. Bright red dress, skin tight, and just an incredible ass. Everyone absolutely noticed her, and she knew it.\n\n\n- I couldn't check her out as much as I wanted, because of the girlfriend. That made it so much worse, which made me try to check her out all night.\n\n\n- Girlfriend and I were going through a rough patch, so I wasn't opposed to seeing what else was out there. This girl was not helpful when I was in that state of mind.\n\n\nSeriously though, when I say her ass looked amazing...",

And like I said, if there's enough of a particular group (alternative hair colors, booted heels, high heels, rave girls, leggings, tall girls, short girls, redheads, cosplayers) I start looking up others and imagine that original woman in their positions, or their clothing... sometimes I imagine what they may be up to, if they're getting all the pleasure they can.

One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second; she didn\u2019t see me at all. But I\u2019ll bet a month hasn\u2019t gone by since, that I haven\u2019t thought of that girl.\"\n\nIt's like that with me, I guess. I'll forget about that cute girl in leggings within minutes of leaving the store, but the girl at the coffee shop I may remember years afterward.",
