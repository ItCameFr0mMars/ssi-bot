            "body": "You can call me Tyler, as it's my name haha.\n\nI would love to pursue your Starfleet rp scenario. I'd love to play all ranges of characters.  Do we have a cocky, reckless pilot? Sign me up.  Do we need a stoic type? Sounds good.  I'd love to just build out the world as we go honestly.  We can set up situations and play towards them. \n\nDetailed rp is very appreciated, and difficult to find.  My responses may be limited during working hours, but multiple responses daily would be ideal for me.\n\nI'll start with short little set up and we can start there if your interested.\n\nCaleb dropped the bag on his shoulder the ground at the foot of what is now his bed for the next five years.  He had gotten the pilot assignment due to some unusual circumstances.  Usually a brand new starship going on a long term exploratory voyage goes to the most valued copilot in the fleet, sometimes veteran pilots request the assignment, even the damn kids only two or three years out of the academy can even get it.  Definitely not someone with Caleb's resume.  While being very impressive in certain areas he lacked qualities seen as very valuable to an exploratory starship.  He was quick to decision, rather than patient.  Reckless rather than \"thoughtful\".  Older rather than younger, being 8 years removed from the academy.  While most skilled pilots were given assignments three to four years after leaving, Caleb had chosen to stay as a copilot. Looking at the clock Caleb let out a nervous sigh, walked to his door, and heard down the hallway to the lift.  There was a bridge staff meeting in fifteen minutes, where he would be meeting the rest of the officers for the first time, and he would rather not be late.",
