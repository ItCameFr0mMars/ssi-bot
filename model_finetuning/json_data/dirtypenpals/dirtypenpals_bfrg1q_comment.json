            "body": "You're in a forest, it's really calm and shit, birds are chirping. So many trees. You're lost. So lost. You hear a whisper, like an echo, deep into the forest. Focus on it, follow it through the woods. Drag yourself deeper and deeper-- You should feel more lost, but the voice makes you feel safe. The more steps you take towards it, the clearer it becomes, the safer you feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFocus on it. The voice guides you. Soon, you will join it, and you will no longer be lost. \"Faster.\" The voice urges on. \"Step towards me and I will guide you\", the voice ushers. Giddily, you walk faster. The voice is all you are focused on now. There is nothing else, only silence, darkness and a glimmer ahead of you, that guides your steps further into the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Good girl.\" The gentle, soothing voice pierces through your mind and sends shivers down your spine. \"Good girl.\" Breathe in and out, in and out, slowly. Relax-- You are safe now. You have found the voice, and the voice has found you. The voice keeps whispering into your ear, soft gentle words as your mind fades into silence, numbness and calm. You are no longer lost, you are safe forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, the voice is gone. The soothing light that shone gently around you has disappeared. There is nothing but darkness around you. You tremble and shudder; you are too scared to take a step. You start whimpering, heaving quickly as you look around you blindly, looking for the voice that was speaking to you, yet you are so frozen you can no longer speak. \"Where are you? Where did you go?\" You keep telling yourself in your head, as if to summon the voice back in your panic. \"Please... Please...\" You plead and beg, but you can hear nothing but cruel silence. Your panic grows stronger and you are filled with despair. You sit down on the floor and sob, then burst into tears. No one is here for you. You are alone, in the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore the broken thoughts in your head drive you to insanity, you suddenly hear a faint whisper. Your eyes open wide and stare into the darkness. \"Focus. Focus\" It repeats. You shut your eyes, so you can focus on the voice, the only thing that matters. \"Obey.\" The voice ushers firmly and echoes deep into your mind. \"Obey and you will be safe.\" Tears rolling down your cheeks, you nod silently at the voice in your head. Calm overtakes you once again, soothing your cold body. You feel warm and relaxed as you breathe, in and out, in and out, to the whispers of the soft, reassuring voice in your head. \"Bow down.\" The voice commands, gently. Slowly, you sink onto your knees and lower your head to the floor, hands out as if praying to a god. \"Good girl. Now, wake up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(This is when you wake up to the nice guy who's been putting you into a trance and do whatever the fuck he says. :3 Totally randomly felt like writing this, I hope you found it kind of entertaining to read. Initially wanted to be sarcastic.)",
