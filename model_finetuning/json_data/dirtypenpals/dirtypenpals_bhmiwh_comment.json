            "body": "Just to put in my two cents, I certainly do feel anxiety when I come onto DPP at the end of the day and see a prompt that's made it all the way up to the top with two dozen upvotes and find that it's something I'm really interested in. I usually end up friending/following the poster or browsing their post history to get a better idea of what they're into, so I can strike when the hammer is hot in the future.\n\nOf course, it doesn't hurt to send something out; I recently connected with a writer whose post was up for 8 hours because I felt that I had to give it a real shot even if it meant silence. Sometimes you just gotta go for it.\n\nIf you connect but both parties lack chemistry, we usually come to a mutual agreement that it would be best if we don't work together. It happens from time to time.\n\nOn the flipside...\n\nSpeaking from experience, I consider 3+ well-written responses to be a large amount of interest. I'm not kidding in the slightest. Most of the time I get crickets whenever I throw up one of my reposts for the millionth time, but when I get 3+ responses, I honestly feel swamped.\n\nMy solution is to play out the roleplay concurrently with all three writers for around a dozen or so messages to get a feel for our chemistry and how our writing styles mesh together, and then select the one that seems the most promising while extending apologies toward the others, but offering a possibility of rekindling the roleplay in the future. Quite honestly, I feel bad for doing it, but rejection is quite common on DPP and I'm a staunch believer that an outright rejection is better than silence. I have rekinkled one or two roleplays with people who I initially rejected then picked up again in the future.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is, you just gotta take a chance sometimes. Just think of DPP as dating, you're not gonna get a date with everyone, so cherish the ones you do get.",
