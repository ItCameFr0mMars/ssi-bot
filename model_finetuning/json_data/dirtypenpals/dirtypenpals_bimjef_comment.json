Do they like it when I teach them things?\n\n\"What do they do for a living?\" is something I'm going to ask at some point... but it isn't in the top ten, because it doesn't make the slightest difference to whether I want them.\n\nThe only dealbreaker for me is cheating.

            "body": "Interesting question. Here's my full and honest answer.\n\nSure, why not? We live in a capitalist society. It's a far more honourable a profession than, say, commission based financial adviser.\n\nI'm not the kind of guy who gets off on sharing his girl, but I'm not the kind who wants to put her in a burkha either. To me, stripping does not feel like I'm sharing too much of you. It's a controlled environment where the roles are clear, and the number one rule is \"look but don't touch\", so I really don't think I'd feel jealous. In fact, I'd get a little kick from knowing that I was the only one with access to the body all the guys are paying to see.\n\nThe hardest part would be introducing you to my more judgemental relatives. Yes, I mean you, Mom. I've been leaving my laces untied for a multiple decades, and I have yet to trip. It's getting old. Also, who told you my NSFW Reddit name?\n\nSorry, where was I. Apart from my Mom, who only wants the best for me and would hate to see me get hurt again, I'd have no problem whatsoever.\n\nHaving said that, I can think of one situation where it would make a difference.\n\nLet's say we may and you so dancing to have a baby. But we still have a mortgage to pay, so when the time is right, you go back to dancing. No big deal.\n\nBut supposing I was married to a woman who's never done anything like stripping. A year after our baby's born, money's tight, so she takes a job as a stripper. I'd be really uncomfortable with that. I guess it's a matter of pride: I'm cool with you being a stripper, but I'm not cool with being the guy who, in effect, sent you up the pole in the first place. Does that make sense?\n\nSo stripping still could make a difference to me somewhere down the line. But lots of things make a difference. That boy you kissed in 7th grade who you still secretly pine for makes a difference. I still say it's no big deal.\n\nFinally, let's be full on cynical. The healing power of money can work wonders in people's lives, and I imagine you're making a lot. If, say, he has a low sperm count and your stripping pays for the IVF, he won't forget that in a hurry.",
