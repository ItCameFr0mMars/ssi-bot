Is there a time frame that you tend to try to reply within for a post?  For example, I tend to avoid F4M posts if it's over an hour old.  I rarely make exceptions to that rule.  Early on, I would respond to those messages but rarely got any response, probably due to either them already having chosen someone or them having logged out or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo is there any timeframe most people use on choosing which prompts to go for?",

If anything I may wait until 8 or 10 hours later or the next day or two and just check back to see if they're still interested or wanting to try another partner. If nothing else it's nice to just drop a line and tell someone you really enjoyed their prompt, even if no roleplay comes of it right away, it can spark some conversation or service a way to introduce you to one another.\n\nTrying to be \"first\" or get in early just means that you're hurrying to respond, and I find that rarely makes for quality replies. But all this is why I tend to look to other means to connect with people, either via my own posts, meet and greets, or other conversations.

Sometimes I get a bunch of replies very quickly, other times I'll get inquiries a week after I submitted the post. (I have no idea how they're even seeing it at that point, but I'm not complaining!) \n\nIn general I find women tend to overestimate the amount or rate of replies that guys get, and they say adorable things like \"I'm sure you got buried in replies but I hope you're still looking!\" and I'm thinking \"Girl, you're the second person I've heard from in 12 hours.\" :) \n\nIt depends a ton on the post itself and the timing in submitting it, too. I think longer, detailed RP prompts have a long shelf-life than a quick chat does, since the latter kind of implies a very brief, temporary interval. But as far as responding goes, I figure that sending a brief, friendly PM to show some appreciation is rarely going to hurt, and if she didn't get any good responses or got ghosted by the guys she was writing with, she may be thrilled to have someone pop up a day or two later and express interest. And if nothing else, it puts you on each other's radar as potential partners in the future, which helps everyone involved.",

Of this 28 were single lines without any reference to my post, like \"Hi\" \"Love the prompt\" \"Very sexy\" or \"Would love to play\".    \n\nA further 5 of these replies were pitching unrelated scenes or requests for nudes or masturbation buddies.   \n\nThe final 12 were what I would call \"high-quality\" replies.

            "body": "If the post doesn't have the \"closed\" flair and the user is still active (has posted or commented something within the past month), if I stumble across a post that I like I'll reach out no matter how long it's been.\n\nPartly this is because of my experience: When I post an [F4M] or [F4A] prompt, the responses I get within the first half hour are usually the worst, because they're mainly people who are just trying to get noticed before I get \"swamped\" (which, actually, for a long-term specific prompt doesn't actually happen often) by blasting out something quick. The high-quality responses have always come in hours or days later. I've even had people see a new prompt of mine (wherein I say that I have other prompts still open in my post history), go looking through my history, and message me about a months-old prompt. And those responses are usually fantastic!\n\nBut bear in mind that my opinion and luck is colored by the fact that I tend to roleplay long-term, detail oriented scenes, often involving worldbuilding. For these kinds of prompts I find that people are generally looking for the best match of a partner to play with, whereas for shorter, less involved prompts, people tend to want to get a roleplay going because they're horny *right then,* and they aren't as likely to still be interested in a day's time.\n\nJust for fun, some examples!\n\nSay a post reads, \"I'm off today and feeling frisky! I just keep thinking about my older next door neighbor. Who wants to RP him coming over and railing me?\" then you probably want to respond within the first hour in order to get in while that person's still interested in the scenario. They've mentioned that they're available for an unusually long span of time (a day off) and want to use that time to roleplay, which means they probably want a quicker scene and won't be available, or still feeling horny, if you message them hours later.\n\nIf a prompt says something more general, like \"I've been obsessed with frat boys for some time now. I'd like to play a scene where I get too drunk at your frat house and end up serving the pledges!\" then I'd say go ahead and message even if it's been a day or two, so long as it isn't marked as closed. There's no indication that they're feeling something temporary or time-limited, and it never hurts to ask if the prompt's still open.\n\nAnd if you find a prompt that says something like \"Long term--looking for a partner to help me build an alternate universe where humans evolved with different supernatural abilities and then split into warring clans. I'd love it if we could have a Romeo and Juliet situation build out of the inter-political tension! Build-up is a must.\"  then, so long as it's not closed... message them! Even if it's been weeks, or even a month or two, there's a good chance they'd still be up for playing it. The more specific the scenario, the less likely they've found someone to play it with; and if they want a something long-term and collaborative, they're probably not writing \"in the heat of the moment,\" but are likely waiting for just the right partner to build a story with them.",
