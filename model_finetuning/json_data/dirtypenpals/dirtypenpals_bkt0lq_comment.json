If you should decide to accept it, I offer you our sword, wrath forged into steel, for so long as you would have it. \n\nShould the Emperor's foes come for you, they shall meet the same fate as have all before them, crushed beneath our steelshod tread. I also bring with me everything required to service and restore Argentum, and if you should require, most heavy machinery, and I myself am somewhat skilled in the rites of the Machine Cult. I'm sure we can be of use to you in one way or the other, my lady.\n\nShould you require a more in-depth litany of our wargear I can provide a data-slate detailing our allotment and armament. Payment? I require none, besides supply for Argentum's hunger: ammunition, fuel to feed her core. For myself, I can think of no better reward than the company of your crew and yourself, and a tithe of sustenance. Argentum and I are currently housed in bay Gamma 2-7, if you wish to find me, I'll be there.",
