After all, I wouldn\u2019t be sending out a scene if I didn\u2019t want someone else to play it out with.\n\nPlease, guys, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a few electrons to send a reply if a prompt appeals to you! What\u2019s the worst that can happen? That you don\u2019t end up playing? That\u2019s a guarantee if you don\u2019t write back! On the other hand, you just might have a great story happen. \n\nIs it that scary to send an anonymous text to someone, who is literally asking for them? Please explain this to me.",
