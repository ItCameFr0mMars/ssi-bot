'Show don't tell' is imo a little over-emphasized. It's good writing advice, but so often it's the *only* writing advice people get, which makes its importance seem over-inflated. Yes, when I'm reading I do prefer to have a lot of visual imagery, but it's okay sometimes to just say 'my character feels angry' rather than 'his jaw clenched, his lips tightening into a thin white line as he glared across the table.' We're doing this for fun after all, not everyone has to write like Tolstoy.\n\nAll metas have to be approved by the mods before they're made visual on the site, although they still only show up in 'new' in the position in time they were initially posted (so, for me, like eight pages in by the time it was approved).

Lots of discussions around them. They did end up with lots of the usual topics but there are new people all the time for whom those topics were relevant.\n\nComments. There were full fledged discussions that ran through some of the posts. I miss that part. That's typically where my connections were made.\n\nThere are far more mods now.\n\nOver time I would say that it feels like there are far more F4F prompts than before.  I'm trying to think if there are more extreme prompts than before but I don't think so.  Incest was plenty popular on DPP long before PornHub caught wind of it. ;)  (to be clear, I wouldn't say that incest lives in the vague description of extreme)",

I guess that's just the nature of a growing community but it feels kind of weird.\n\nMeta posts being not as common as before is noticeable.\n\nI definitely miss some of the veteran writers that retired from DPP.\n\nDefinitely more F4F prompts, but also what I would consider lazy chat requests with poor grammar or just the bare bones skeleton RP request asking someone to give them an idea to start something off. On that note, I kind of wish DPP enforced mandatory Post flairs so it's easier for like minded people to connect with each other and easier to filter in general.",

            "body": "I've been here on and off for about five years under various accounts, since the days of the old flowery-pink layout. I had never been to Reddit before finding DPP; just came across it specifically through searching for erotic pen-pal forums. To be honest, if the list of prompts on the typical DPP \"hot\" page back then had looked the same as it does now, I would have have rolled my eyes and kept moving and never come back.\n\nWhat appealed to me in DPP back then was the depth of discussion and conversation and a general sense of mature, fun engagement. I met a lot of great people on DPP in those early years, and wrote hundreds of pages of stories with them. I learned a lot about myself and about others. There were a lot of real, actual women active on the site back then, many of them verified, and most of them with interesting, frank, smart, outspoken, and sexy inclinations. It seems to me that the general feel of the site was more feminine-flavored as well. That was hugely exciting and made me feel like it would be a great place to learn more about what women enjoy, and to have some meaningful interactions that would make my pulse race and my mind happy.\n\nThese days not so much. I don't expect as much from DPP any more, and I don't visit or reply to people here very often. It feels more like a \"chaterbate\" type site to me now. The assumption is that partner is 99% likely to just be a troll who is screwing around with you anyway, so you might as well just get whatever gratification you can and then bail. If I try to talk about things like safety or friendship or meta-discussion, people generally just spit at me and tell me to piss off. And I'm also not really convinced that there are any actual women left on DPP at all.\n\nNot sure how many people remember this, but the allowable time between posts on DPP used to be much higher \u2013 which had the effect of making prompts and replies a more important investment (but also with a much higher success rate, and a much higher likelihood of turning into an enjoyable, long-term exchange). This is probably the most significant factor in the changes on the site over the years. I remember it being discussed extensively at the time when it was changed, so it was not any big mystery or anything. Some people (myself included) actually thought that the time limit should be raised even further, to promote that kind of investment. Others wanted to lower it, to increase traffic and bring in a different, more chat-oriented type of crowd. The decision to lower it was entirely intentional, and everyone knew what effect it would have.",

My goodness, how time flies.\n\nIt's tough to say how this place has changed because I've been spending less and less time here lately so I don't know if things feel different because I'm not as invested or if things truly have changed. From an objective standpoint, I'll echo a few points made by some of the other respondents: not as many meta posts, fewer comments made on posts, and none of the \"Rock Star\" writers whose posts consistently lived at the top of the front page. There are more posts available to respond to than ever before but at the same time it feels like a much less welcoming place than it once was.\n\nFrom my own personal experience as a writer who prefers longer exchanges, it also seems much more difficult to find a partner willing to stick with a story beyond the initial setup and first couple of scenes. When I first started here it wasn't unusual for my stories to last for months; in recent times, I'm lucky if it goes a week before my partner vanishes. Again, this is based on a small sample size and maybe the issue is me - perhaps my prompts or writing style are no longer appealing?\n\nWhatever the reason, I only lurk here these days; it's fun to occasionally glance over the new prompts and open forum threads, but I feel like the partners I'm looking for are long gone.",
