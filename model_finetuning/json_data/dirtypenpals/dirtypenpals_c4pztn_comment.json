The problem is lazy-ass replies from people who clearly did not read the prompt.  Suggesting that the OP try more open-ended prompts, is just silly, as well.  The prompts were pretty open-ended.  People seem to have a problem with prompts by people who know exactly what they're looking for.\n\nPeople are asking what's wrong with the reply, \"Hey I love that scene let's play.\"  If they had bothered to read the prompt, they would know what the problem is... not reading the prompt!

And I know you're not asking for a novel. \n\nI keep track of it when I send messages and when I get a response. Out of the last 20 PMs I've sent seeking RP partners, I've gotten 3 replies. Overall since I started keeping track, only 20% of the time do I receive a reply of any sort. Not even the basic courtesy of a \"Sorry, not interested.\" \n\nMaybe I could have portrayed myself better? I don't know. And I could be more skilled, sure, but I am *not* a bad writer. I usually write a few paragraphs in a PM seeking RP when I decide to approach someone. But in the past I've had *so many* incidents where I spent 20-30 minutes detailing a depthy post only to get ignored.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is this. Maybe if more people around here had a little more courtesy and at least sent a rejection message, it might increase the amount of effort we put in, as at least then we would be acknowledged. Personally I rarely even send PMs anymore because I don't enjoy having my limited time evaporate before my eyes. It's usually not worth my time to put a lot of effort into \"prospecting.\" \n\nSomething simple. A polite let-down. Mine usually look roughly like this: \"Hey, thanks a lot for messaging me! Unfortunately, I don't think this is going to work because [reason]. Good luck finding a partner, though!\"\n\nI don't always give a reason because sometimes I just go off a gut feeling\u2014I've been RPing for about ten years now and I just get a *feeling* when an RP won't work.\n\nAnyway, that's two more cents for your growing jar of pennies.",

Let's see:\n\n\"Hey, thanks a lot for replying! I appreciate your message. However, I don't think our kinks line up. Good luck finding a better partner!\"\n\n22 seconds. Then ignore any further messages.\n\nAlso, I never said anything about *women* specifically, because I've received the silent treatment from most of the *males* I message too. I've dealt with bitchy guys. I'm bisexual, after all. \n\nHowever, it's your prerogative to conduct yourself how you see fit.

So if you don't want to deal with it, I get it.\n\nOP's whole point was that she wanted to see more effort from people. My point is that if you want to see more effort from people, treat the people who put in effort better. \n\nMaybe I did a poor job saying that.
