            "body": "Pt 1: This always happens, I write too many characters and have to split everything into parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to give me an interview about my wood I don't mind. If we're all sharing that sounds like something we should give out to the public. I think a comment based share is appropriate. I don't have anything to hide.\n\n&gt;Does it happen every morning?\n\n* Yup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do you wear boxers or briefs?\n\n* Boxers, or nothing underneath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Has anyone seen it?\n\n* I'm assuming you mean unintentionally seen it.\n* Unlike women, when men go to the bathroom they typically use a urinal. Depending on how much the owners of the building respect the people using it, it either has a couple wall shields about 6 inches from the wall or it's blatantly an open trough that men whip their dicks out and Bukkake into. It's just the nature of the room. When you zip it down and tug it out, the room usually gets quiet.\n* Everyone whose ever watched me as a kid tells me I was rough not mean, but I would sneak out of the house, and get into trouble for fun. I remember this one time my older sister decided to go hang out with one of the neighbor girls of this new Asian family down our street while i was supposed to stay at home with my grandmother. I jumped out my two story window onto the roof and climbed down the back and ran into the woods. I just kept walking for a mile through there till I found the neighbor's house. That day they just didn't lock their door. So when I got there, I just walked right in. Nobody was home. I raided their pantry for granola bars and pop tarts, pissed all over their bathroom and played their older brother's video games until I got bored. Then I just walked right out and left. I waved to that neighbor girl while I was walking back home. I ended up fucking her years later. She told me she would fantasize about me raiding her drawer and walking in on her naked. Never went in her room, but I let her dream about it a couple times.\n* My mom would wake me up before I used my phone for an alarm, so I\u2019d always have to lie there pretending to be too tired to get up from under the covers when I had to leave.\n* Several times my sister or mother would walk in on me and think I had a boner under my covers when I didn\u2019t their faces were always funny\n* This one time i went to a summer school at Harvard and a group of my friends wanted to sleep in my bed. So my roommate and I put our beds together and like 7 people slept on these two twin beds. This one Canadian girl ended up sleeping next to me. We both woke up terrible, she was covered in sweat from the blanket and all the people and when she noticed me and my other friend woke up with morning wood next to her she jumped out embarrassed. Which was funny because she\u2019d seen dicks A lot. No judgement, she\u2019s still my friend, but she\u2019s eaten more than her own fair share of sausage up to then. So it was kind of funny how shy she got over it when she was the one who wanted to get in bed with us.\n* Considering your username, I'll tell you about this one time with a Baby sitter I had. She was a shit baby sitter, kinda hot, but useless. It gets a bit after dinner maybe 7 or 8. She can\u2019t cook. So I end up making us some food in my kitchen. So I'm making eggs in a nest on a skillet and broiling a few slices of ham on sheet of foil over the oven rack. Well, nature calls and I gotta drain the lemon. So I tell her to watch it: keep it from burning. And, she's texting on her phone like she doesn't give a shit. But she clearly hasn\u2019t eaten anything either since we\u2019ve both been at my house.\n\nA brief aside: I don't know if you've ever been to olive garden, but they have these good breadsticks that are essentially the only reason to eat there, and we took some home. The interesting thing about the bag is that it was developed by some pyromaniac psycho: it's lined with foil on the inside and paper on the outside. It keeps food warm, but it is not microwaveable. This dumb bimbo pulls out the bag from our fridge and plops the whole thing in a microwave. Bad move. It's on fire in like 10 seconds. Meanwhile i'm just hanging in the bathroom and I hear \"Oh shit!\" from outside and I just kind of start laughing at her thinking she's burned my eggs and keep going. So I unclasp my belt, reach into my crotch and tug out my pecker to do my business. She starts freaking out as I'm letting loose. She runs over, shoves open the door and runs into the bathroom to tell me my kitchen's on fire.\n\nNow I can\u2019t prove it, but I think this was around the time I learned in history how Lyndon Johnson would pull out his dick to tell reporters to go fuck themselves. I\u2019m kinda pissed off at hearing this so I just turn around and give her an eye full of what's going on down south. She just kinda trails her eyes down at it and shoots her eyes to the floor. I'm pretty sure she gave it a couple double takes. I like to think so. I just leave my cock out as I ask her \" get the fuck out of my bathroom, what did you do?\" Her brain was so confused at dealing with both the stress and a set of conflicting orders that she just stood there and nervously mumbled at me. She gives me this stupid spiel: \"I'm not sure\", \"i don't know\" \"maybe I accidentally\" blah blah blah. I'm sitting there, lording over her with my dick out, glaring down at this woman like she's the kind of scum I clean off my windshield and then the fire alarm goes off. So I stuff it all back into my pants and run out to the kitchen.\n\nSmoke's coming out of my oven, my eggs have been burned into gravel, and there's a fire in my microwave. The microwave was bolted into the wall so I had to take the hot mess out. So I pick up some metal tongs I left on the counter for the ham, pulled the burning bag out and walked it outside. I dumped it in the fire pit in my backyard. Plopped open the windows and tossed out my burned dinner. I spent the rest of the next hour just calling this girl a dumb bitch over and over again while she asked me not to tell anyone about it. The last thing I remember about her was that she had nice tits.",

            "body": "Pt 2: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How do they react?\n\nWhen people walk in on you with your pecker out, they pretend to not notice. If they opened a door, they just close it. They will always avert their eyes. Their faces are always anxious. Do you masturbate?\n\n* If i'm on this subreddit then definitely. Like 5 times a day If I have time which isn't really feasible. I'm just furious for the day If I don't bust at least one out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If so, w\\[h\\]ere\n\n* In my room, usually on top of my bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;and how?\n\nI choke that thing like it owes me money while some pornstar gets brutally suffocated and has her asshole stuffed in front of a live camera crew on my computer. Back when I had a roommate I did it under a blanket. I\u2019d usually go dry or throw on a little spit to lubricate the pump. I never subscribed to using lotion until I got into college an even then didn\u2019t bother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn regards to how I touch it:\n\nThe most sensitive part isn\u2019t specifically my head, but this ring of soft skin underneath the flare of my penis where you can see my main valve connect with the head. I don\u2019t really play with my balls at all beyond keeping them warm and full in my hand and occasionally giving them a soft tug. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I shoot it:\n\nWhen I cum, I usually pick a target to blast my load on since I know it\u2019s going to hit something. Sometimes I shoot it onto the screen of some gone wild picture, other times I do it on a patch of my bitch wall. If I feel like I want to keep things pristine I could cover the blast with a tissue but there\u2019s usually too much for that and I\u2019m not in the mood keep things clean usually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn regards to how it feels:\n\nIf I had to describe how it feels to a woman for a man to cum it\u2019s just getting more and more furiously angry. For girls it\u2019s like this wave sensation where erotic feelings build and build and switch gears only to crescendo into a new wave as things heat up and up and up. For guys, it\u2019s kind of like dissolving all your forethought and self restraint as some teasing bitch you just want to smack around gets you more and more worked up. I get more beastial, and not in the complementary way. Occasionally I buck. Usually I grunt. I\u2019m pissed off, as I slide my hands up and down my shaft. I feel more and more like I just want to break something in the room. I usually don\u2019t since i\u2019m focused on getting off, but If I stopped in the middle of it, I\u2019d probably trash my room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are you able to pee with an erection?\n\n* Yes, but the angle is terrible, I need to be like 5 feet away and any minute pressure change would shower it all onto the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How long does the erection last?\n\n* Boners are a hassle, i've never simply waited for one to go away on its own. I either calm it down by cooling it, massaging the blood out of it, or just busting my nuts onto my wall. If you don\u2019t have any interesting morning wood tales, maybe just share any amusing boner related stories. Did you have any awkward moments or maybe a sexy one? Sometimes When i\u2019m walking around naked with a boner it feels really weird to just have my member swinging around. It\u2019ll sway left and right and bounce when I walk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh yeah happy 4th of July!",
