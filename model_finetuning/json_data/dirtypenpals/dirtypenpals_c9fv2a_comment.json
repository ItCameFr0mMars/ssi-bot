It's either a kink they never mentioned, or the entire scenario is not at all what was advertised.\n\n\"Oh, did I not mention I can't get off unless I'm being raped? That's awkward. I guess you better rape me!\" No thanks! I guess that's my fault for not including \"does not like to rape people\" in my already exhaustive list of kinks and anti-kinks. I mean, maybe you should have included that in your prompt, but it's probably my fault for not explicitly mentioning that I'm not the kind of girl to rape people.\n\n\"You're into lactation? Great. I lock the door and you're my milk slave now.\" Again, probably my fault. I guess I should have let you know that being enslaved and abused isn't my thing. I should get a T-shirt that says \"Not for rapes\".\n\n\"Oh, did I say this was a light hearted romp through a kinky fantasy world? I meant demons have murdered everyone and you don't have any tools or abilities that would allow you to fight back.\" Yeah. This one definitely isn't my fault. Dude just badgered me into playing with him after I said I didn't have time, lied about the kind of game he wanted to play, lead me on for twenty posts or so, then informed me that the world was hopelessly bleak and that my clearly outlined kinks (and the entire reason I agreed to play in the first place instead of napping) were to be ignored.\n\nHow do these people exist? Are you so desperate to play with _anyone_ that you'll lie about you want on the chance I won't immediately reject you when I learn the truth? How do they not figure out that this doesn't work? Maybe you're not being ghosted, my dudes. You're probably getting blocked because you're creepy, violating, and liars.",

Perhaps they also think no one wants to play through the scenario they've envisioned, so the next best thing (to them) is to throw out a scenario close to it and try to warp the session towards their original idea and hope their partner doesn't complain too much, or just spring it on them and hope their partner has invested too much effort to walk away at that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is, of course, a shitty thing to do and outright deceptive. You can do things to mitigate the chances of this kind of thing happening, sure - clearly define your kinks and limits, discuss the general outline and tone of the role-play before starting in on it in earnest, agree on what will and won't be included, and include clearly defined OOC messages to handle discussion and feedback throughout the session. Which is all well and good, but if you get someone who's dead set on playing out something completely different than what you thought you were agreeing to participate in, there's really nothing much you can do about that beyond popping smoke and noping out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really sucks to invest several messages of effort into something you were presumably looking forward to playing out and then discovering that you have to throw up your hands and cut bait on the whole debacle. But unfortunately enough that's what usually ends up happening in real life as well and DPP has yet to transcend basic human shittiness. You live and you learn and hopefully next time you find someone who wants to play \\*with\\* you, not just use you for their own amusement (unless that's what you want them do in the session of course).",

But there's only so much time in the day and people posting open ended prompts that provide no jump off point for their partner or any hint about what they actually want has been an issue around here for just about ever, and the issue shows no signs of abating any time soon. I just don't see any need to get worked up over it. Personally, I just skip prompts that fall into either of the two aforementioned categories - I don't have the inclination to sort out whatever the poster is looking for if they don't have the inclination to inform me up front. But for others that feel differently, reaching out with an initial inquiry is best to make sure you're both operating with the same assumptions.",

Something I hadn't been able to engage too much with as most of my roleplaying experience came from MMORPGs, where ERP was taboo and generally chastised inside the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after that I started to sorta challenge myself. I wanted to try and make a name for myself on DPP. Not necessarily become famous or anything, but at least be well known enough that a handful or more people will see my name and think \"I recognize that person!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about the rest of you?",

Story wasn't over when her RL went nuts.\n\nTreasure that dude you've got. Even if you two wrap the story you're working on right now, see if you &amp; he can leave it open to go back to sometime.
