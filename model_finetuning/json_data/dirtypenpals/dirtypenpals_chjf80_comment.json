Sadly these types of people are quite uncommon. When I see someone like that, I try to go above an beyond in an attempt to secure a pleasant scenario for the both of us. \n\nFunnily enough, it doesn't seem to matter when it comes to reply size as long as you go above around 5 sentences, just to show you actually put in effort. This is of course, when replying to people who want to discuss stuff rather than jump right in. Concisely expressing your desires, expectations, and limits are important for people who get flooded with messages. \n\nI'm addition, laying out questions seems to help too. Give them easily understood, numbered questions to reply back with. Here is a short example of what I do:\n\n*I'd like to ask a few questions to see if we are compatible:\n\n1. Would you mind if I played the role of _______ ?\n\n2. Are you okay with _______ as a kink?\n\n3. Are you planning on this being long or short term?*\n\nI've been ghosted/ignored by people whether I wrote 5 or 30 sentences. I haven't really noticed a big difference in success after that 5 sentence margin. Other than those I scout out... I'd say my reply rate is around 20-40%, depending on luck for the day. \n\nHope this info helps.",

It comes off as more literate to me (nothing against first, of course- I just don't prefer it). Second and third messages are also important. If someone sends me a good intro, then immediately falls off the moment I respond, I typically don't continue to have interest, unless what they suggest is *very* unique.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't give much more than what I already have. I don't get many replies, as what I look for is fairly niche, and on top of that, the stigma for male writers looking for female partners is kinda...palpable, on DPP at least.

The best reply is is age, name, description, kinks/limits, and what about the prompt seemed interesting. The last part is the most important because it give me the opportunity to give a response that continues the conversation naturally. I usually don\u2019t respond to replies that jump straight into role play, because it feels very one sided. It screams I just want to get off and go. Which is fine, but I want a mutual effort to maintain each other\u2019s pleasure. This is the same for replies that call you degrading names on the first message. I love degradation, but it needs to come off as human first object second. Following this criteria will usually get you more experienced rpers who know how to handle situations like sub/domdrop and aftercare. There are exceptions of course. Chat responses that get straight into the fantasy can definitely be done right. I can\u2019t explain to you what exactly is being done right. It\u2019s just as you gain experience with rping, you can tell experience and intent.\n\n2. *Limits being important*\n\nDon\u2019t ignore limits. Don\u2019t ignore limits. If it\u2019s a limit that was in the prompt your message shouldn\u2019t incorporate aspects that have been limits. Don\u2019t ask for someone with no limits because this people don\u2019t exist. They are just not experienced enough with their own limits to identify them.\n\n3. **Hey is not something I know how to respond to**\n\n\nI am not extroverted. I very rarely am able to turn nothing into a conversation. If you give me nothing, I won\u2019t respond. It\u2019s not malicious, I just physically can\u2019t. It\u2019s not in my personality.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAs for standing out, a small description of why you enjoy the things you enjoy. \u201cI think it\u2019s so hot when, because\u201d I want to know why I stood out to you in the sea of roleplays.

I know it takes some time to craft a quality reply, so getting quick responses back isn't as important to me.

There seems to be very few partners who are able to communicate that they didn't like something that someone said and be able to work past it.\n\nI can't tell how many times that replies to a post of mine have suddenly stopped because something has been said that might have been a bit too much or out of line with someone's interests and rather than attempt to fix a misstep, people don't give anyone a chance and stop communicating all together. \n\nIt is very disheartening because I like to think that I can appeal to almost anyone's tastes, being someone with very few limits but when someone just shuts down instead of talking it out, it makes me feel like I've gone too far and put my foot in my mouth. It's not great for self confidence, especially because it makes me think that I am terrible at writing...",

I\u2019m a professional writer and this is my pleasure writing, but I want to write with another *writer*, and I just know I won\u2019t be able to maintain interest with someone who doesn\u2019t have a basic grasp of grammar and spelling. I\u2019ve had one very successful, amazing long-term role play on here up until my partner ghosted me with our story left unfinished, but I try not to be disheartened that there aren\u2019t other fantastic partners out there who would be a good match for me. (I\u2019ve had a few shorter ones as well, but the long term is more my jam.)\n\nIt is worth waiting for those good replies, where your kinks match up, where writing styles seem like they\u2019ll mesh, and where you have a great connection and can\u2019t wait for the other person\u2019s update and to add yours. I get incredibly invested in my role plays and I want a partner who will care about it just as much. \n\nJust another thing I would point out I hadn\u2019t seen mentioned yet, if you aren\u2019t using a throwaway on DPP (or even if you are), I\u2019m going to check out every (or at least the vast majority) of comments and posts from anyone who replies who is of initial interest to me, so make sure there isn\u2019t anything on there that will give me pause. I want to write with someone long term, and I don\u2019t want to do that with someone who is being an asshole all over other subs. On the flip side, an interesting post or comment history, or one that gives me a good indication someone is a fun, interesting person I might enjoy devoting many hours of my life writing with, those replies go right to the top, and I\u2019m very likely to respond to. \n\nGood luck finding someone, I know it\u2019s tough but I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll find someone again for a fantastic role play, and I hope you will, too! :)",

Which is a bummer as that\u2019s easily my favorite type of thing to use. And even when I do find somebody that\u2019s cool with it, they either haven\u2019t heard of the series I\u2019m most interested in playing, or they want to use another series.
