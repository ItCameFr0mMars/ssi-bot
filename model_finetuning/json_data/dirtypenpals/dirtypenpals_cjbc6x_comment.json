Cooking is another favorite of mine. I don't get many chances to do so, but I absolutely love tasting my own homecooked meal. Netflix is THE BEST for TV shows and movies, obviously, but still. Restaurants are good on dates, depending on which one you choose. Finally, reading is basically breathing for me. My bookcase is literally overflowing with books.  \n\n\nAs for what you want out of me, it all depends on what you think is funny. I got a bunch of memes and can make some good references to said memes, but I do have some dark humor as well. That's less prominent though. I'm pretty smart, I like to think, and can have a conversation for a while. Interesting is the main circumstantial part, so I can't promise anything until we start talking.",
