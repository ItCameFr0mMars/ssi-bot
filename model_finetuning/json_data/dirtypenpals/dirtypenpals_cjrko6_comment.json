That stuff can be quite fun, especially with pairings that are really uncommon. \n\nWhat \\*is\\* inherently wrong is when every single race play prompt is the same thing - Asian men are weak pathetic losers with small dicks, and Asian women are submissive little geishas who want to worship American cock - it's not only boring and eye-roll worthy, it's actively perpetuating stereotypes that are harmful to real people. And you can argue all you like about how \"it's just fantasy\" and \"oh I don't \\*really\\* believe any of that\" but when you have so many people in the real world who buy into these stereotypes on some level, consciously or not, that's a pretty flimsy defense. \n\nThere is a \\*lot\\* of internalized racism amongst the AA community especially, and a lot of external racism directed at it too. Regardless of if the OP is actually an Asian woman or an American guy jizzing over his anime fantsies, I can almost guarantee that posts like these come from one of those two things.",

Whether someone conforms to a stereotype or not is still entirely based on their own free will \n\nThis is not a good take. Literally the reason stereotypes become problems is when they're assumed to be true of all people of that demographic. The problem isn't whether or not an individual conforms to a stereotype or not, the problem is that when you have stereotypes that permeate into every single element of a culture, people start to believe those stereotypes, and their beliefs impact their actions. \n\nTake, in this case, OP's post. inb4, I'm not \"offended\" by it, it just makes me roll my eyes a bit. Let's assume OP really is an Indian woman (lmao) with a fantasy that her Indian family is inferior to big strong American men. \n\nInternalized racism in the Asian American community is *way* more firmly ingrained than an outsider would understand, and I made reference to this earlier. There is a huge proportion of Asian women (including South Asian women) who say \"I don't date Asian guys\" as if it's a point of pride for them. It's pretty obvious to anyone inside or out of the community that Asian men have been metaphorically castrated by Western media, consistently portrayed as weak and nerdy and impotent. The difference is that many in the AA community actually *believe* this to an extent, consciously or not, men and women.\n\nSo when you say: \n\n&gt;Anyone smart enough realises the average Indian woman doesn\u2019t want American guys to \u201ccurry\u201d her in cum, and I\u2019m sure this post isn\u2019t going to alter their perspective. \n\nI'd agree with you. But I'd also say the average Indian American woman has a very good change of having embraced negative stereotypes about Indian/Asian men. While OP may not quite literally think all Indian men are pathetic and asexual nerds, she almost certainly has internalized many the negative stereotypes about them, and is therefore culturally conditioned to view them as weaker and less attractive than white men.\n\nI realize this is way more than needs to be said in an erotic literature subreddit; If you're interested in hearing all about the weird nuances and quirks of AA immigrants and the community I'm happy to ramble. The tl;dr is that while I don't think raceplay should be outright banned in this sub, I'd fully support limitations that prevent garbage-tier racist \"fantasies\" like this post.",
