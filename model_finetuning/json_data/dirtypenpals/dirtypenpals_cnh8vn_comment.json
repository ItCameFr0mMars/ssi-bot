            "body": "Many of us find ourselves here for emotional support in some shape or another, whether it is freedom in our sexual inclinations, companionship, or validation of our interests and talents.\n\nFor me, nothing is as thrilling as the stories with interesting characters. Knowing I've written something well and aroused someone sexually, emotionally, mentally, literarily -- whatever, is validating for me. The connection I feel when collaborating with other authors is my primary motivation when I post.\n\nThe reason I'm commenting this is that I hope other people see it, which I hope Kat is cool with. I'm trying to address a message to anyone reading this.\n\nThe opportunity to connect with someone on DPP is real, but with that comes vulnerability and with vulnerability can come self loathing or anxiety when met with disappointing messages or empty inboxes, especially after working hard to write a message or create a post. If you have ever had this feeling, from one author to another, please know that your content and presence is valuable. We love having you here. I would love to receive a message from anyone at all if they feel discouraged, and I'm confident that this OP wouldn't mind it either.\n\nTake care of yourselves and be well.",

I wouldn\u2019t be able to make those connection in person, or even using my main reddit account (I have way too much stock in that). I\u2019d be too shy to, too afraid of rejection. Like, imagine saying to someone face to face, \u201cI\u2019d really like to see you tied up and eating gumdrop buttons off of me like I\u2019m a giant gingerbread man from Shrek 2.\u201d They\u2019d think I\u2019m weird. That I shouldn\u2019t be having those fantasies. That I\u2019m too hung up on that damned movie that came out over a decade ago. I\u2019m too shy to ever admit that.\n\nThat\u2019s kinda why this place is great. I\u2019m allowed to be weird, and I\u2019m allowed to express my vulnerabilities. That\u2019s because I\u2019m not really me, I can be whoever I want, including a giant gingerbread man. And you can too. I mean, not necessarily a giant piece of baked confectionary, but somewhere out here, there\u2019s somebody that can help validate you, and that can mean a lot to a human being. That thought that some part of you, be it your writings, your jokes, or deep, kinky fantasies, are all appreciated. It\u2019s not wrong to seek emotional validation, and it\u2019s not wrong to seek it here. It\u2019s kinda cool that you\u2019re willing to be so direct about it too, when so many people aren\u2019t honest about it in real life.",
