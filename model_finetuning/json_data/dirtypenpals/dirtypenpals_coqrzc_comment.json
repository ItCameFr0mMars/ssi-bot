I get it, out of the dozens of responses a woman gets, she can only play with one or two guys. So no one should expect her to message 29 dudes with \u201csorry, found someone else.\u201d \n\nbut you ladies should also not take first messages as the be all, end all of a persons ability or skill or intellect or how sexually compatible you are.",

I normally wouldn\u2019t even complain because I found some nice kinky girls that have done a good job. Far and few between though. It is ridiculous to think about responding to every single message I understand, but the way I see it you could take the post down when you get to about thirty responses and have a template just like one that was suggested for responders to say \u201cThank you, but no thank you.\u201d Under the same logic, using the template shouldn\u2019t take too long.",

            "body": "As a female that has been posting quite frequently, I can offer some insight. Pretty much any prompt I post I will Can a dump truck of replies. Most of my well written ones I get around 100ish or so, or at the very minimum, 50. My extremely popular prompts where I\u2019ve received 100+ upvotes I can creep up near 200, and my most popular prompt to date in terms of upvotes, I received almost 300 messages. \n\nIt is a number game guys, it really is. Between balancing this and real life, my everyday tasks, work, family, chores, and everything else, I don\u2019t have the time, resources, or energy to comb through every reply and write everyone back. The amount of hours that would take would be staggering. \n\nI\u2019ll generally go through my inbox and when I see one or a couple I like that pertains to my prompt, I\u2019ll message them back and start a conversation or idea. Sometimes if I have time or want to talk to more guys, I\u2019ll go down my inbox and message them. It just really depends on... how busy I am, and, how interested I am. There are times though where I\u2019ve gotten what I\u2019ve wanted out of my prompt, and I\u2019m just no longer interested in playing it. \n\nNow, 300 messages sounds like a lot, but I can safely tell you that at least half of them are one liners, lazy thirsty messages that I instantly discard and just pass over. \n\nSome of the things I really look out for is enthusiasm. I love hearing the why behind everything. I like to hear WHY it turns you on, and how much. I\u2019m more likely to message a guy who sounds very passionate and interested in his message. Even just hearing things like \u201cI love this so much. You have no idea.\u201d .. that\u2019s just a quick example. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not always about length. Reading novels can get tiresome too, especially if it gets very redundant. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t fish. We can tell you\u2019re fishing. I like to hear from guys that genuinely have an interest in what I\u2019m writing, and not just messaging me because you see a F4M and you\u2019ll message every single one hoping for a reply. \n\nSometimes it really does come down to luck, and that\u2019s the harsh reality. But my best piece of advice is if the prompt really connects with you, and you can put that into words, then take your best shot, because then there is a chance you\u2019ll get that orange envelope back. :)",

Single-line responses generally are - or at least feel like - 'Hey, I ignored your prompt, but saw you had [F(blah blah blah)] in the title, so I'd like to get off.'\n\nYou put effort into a response because the prompt moved you, because the idea excited you, and it's worth an investment to make that connection with someone you want to RP with. Ideally you put effort into the response because writing something that you're excited about is enjoyable in and of itself, even if it doesn't turn into more. And if your response is that good, you can convert it into a prompt yourself.\n\n&gt; but you ladies should also not take first messages as the be all, end all of a persons ability or skill or intellect or how sexually compatible you are.\n\nWhen you have twenty-odd replies, what else do you want them to go on? Why should *they* invest time in a reply to you when they've already put time into their prompt and you weren't willing to return the favor on them?\n\nIf you want to keep trying one-line responses, great! But it really shouldn't be surprising if you get even fewer responses when you don't show any engagement in the prompt or the person behind it.",

I've allready spent whole evenings here answering to prompts with long, well thought through answers just to be ignored. I've written 1000 words introductory pm's with character descriptions, pictures, links, intentions, kinks, limits just to be ignored. No 'sorry, I'm allready busy' or 'I think we'll just don't click.' not even a 'fuck you'. Just nothing. More then once I've left ddp after three hours of unsuccessful pms - frustrated and annoyed. So I decided to stop beeing passive and write my own prompts. You know what happens when you post a [M4F] prompt? Usually nothing. Getting five replies is a jackpot!\n\nHonestly, I don't have the nerve to write more than a few lines in my first post. My main kinks, my limits, a few general thoughts. If you decide to reply, we can get busy and you can have everything from me. But until then, I don't have the time, energy or frankly, frustration tolerance.\nBeeing spammed by replies seem like a luxury problem to me. Enjoy the attention and pick the ones you like.",
