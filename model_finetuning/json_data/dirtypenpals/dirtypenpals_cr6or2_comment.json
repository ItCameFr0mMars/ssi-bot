But once you finally take the plunge and find a compatible partner to play with, I think you'll realize that there was nothing to be nervous about and you'll wish you had started sooner.  For me, it was just realizing that this is all just anonymous fun and you can walk away at any time or block anyone who is making you uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I can tell you from experience that posting your own prompt as a F4M will result in your inbox being filled very quickly with many guys who are more than eager to play.  This can be quite overwhelming at first, especially if you attempt to juggle multiple conversations at the same time.  And the other issue is that most of your responses will be low effort (\"hey wats up sexxy\") or a copy and paste ignoring everything about the prompt you posted.\n\nThat's why I'd say you're better off waiting for a prompt that turns you on and replying.  I've rarely, if ever, been ignored when I've replied to someone else's prompt and appeared engaged and excited about playing with them.  Guys have a much lower response ratio when posting on here so in my experience they're very excited to find a willing partner and get started right away.\n\nBest of luck and I hope you start enjoying DPP very soon!",

Don't get too fixated on any one response or prompt being *The One* - go into them with the idea that is fun, it's interaction, and it's sexy entertainment, and it's hard not to have a good time. Give it a try - post a prompt knowing that it's totally okay if you don't get a single response or upvote, because you can always post it again the next day, or write a new one. I've seen the same prompt sit untouched one day and go to the top of the page the next. I've watched people post the same prompt for a week and then get that perfect reply that turns into months of storytelling.\n\nAnd responses can be just as much about YOU having fun as they are trying to snag a partner. Do you see a prompt that catches your eye and gets the wheels turning in your head? Write what moves you. If you and the OP click, then great, but if they don't respond or say no, it could be just as likely that the timing was off, or someone else just had an idea that tickled their fancy in that particularly ticklish spot.\n\nThe only way you can really go wrong is by being disrespectful, not closing the door on disrespectful people, or not trying at all. :)  Have fun!",

I've personally tried one of those, and only close to ~200 messages of really thick writing did we get to anything resembling the kinky stuff we discussed about in the beginning. Other RPs that I try to do where it takes time to get to kinky stuff tends to fall off a bit in enthusiasm. \n\nIt's good that people want to play that low intensity ramp up into spicier activity, but you have to remember that more than a few responses a day is good for partners. People often make a prompt thinking \"I'm a piece of fuckmeat *right now*\" not \"I'll be a piece of fuckmeat after a whole day of negotiations and then another day (or more) of backstory building.\" For most of us, I'd say that the constant intensity isn't a turn off because we aren't doing this for most of the day. We're living mundane lives, and a little orange message is a nice fantastical distraction. \n\nHaving limits is fine and natural, though it is going to limit your potential partners compared to people without limits willing to message everyone. I'd say that you should still try to respond to some prompts that are spicier that you'd like and try to negotiate around some things you might not enjoy. Not all the kinks that people list are mandatory for their enjoyment in an RP, and there are plenty of people willing to work around it.",
