Just like it is creepy or wrong for a boss to date an employee and a Professor to date an Adult student, no one ever wields the kind of developmental power over you that a parent does except MAYBE an Older Sibling.  One of the reasons I admit I enjoy these fantasies we play with in this group is that being able to play with power without commensurate responsibility?  All of the control with none of the \"I'm fucking this person up for life\".  Legalizing incest,even sibling incest opens up a lot of doors to be abused in a society that is already too fucked up and terrible about ignoring abuse as it is.\n\nBut then, if you think incest should be legalized, why are you unsettled by him dating women young enough to be his daughter?",
