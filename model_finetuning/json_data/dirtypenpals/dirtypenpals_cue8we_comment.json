Men from all over the world, of different races and ethnicities sat around the table. Most well in to later stages of their life. \n\nThe man who sat at the head of the table was young, far younger than those seated around him. \n\n\"Welcome to the two hundredth assembly of the Holy Order of Sadia. For two millennia Our Order has maintained balance in our fragile world. Our world has been in a era of peace for centuries due to our efforts. We meet every fifty years to maintain this order and while this two hundredth meeting is one to celebrate, we must appoint a new Cleric to this Order.\"\n\nThe young man paused, looking at the other members. \n\n\"For centuries the Clerics have maintained the peace by keeping the forces of evil at bay. Ensuring that this evil atones for the suffering and chaos inflicted on to this mortal world....Now gentlemen...we all know there have been several incidents with the Cleric's underestimation of our nemesis. Incidents that could have allowed this evil to escape back in to the mortal world...ever since the establishment of the Clerics, every Cleric had been of the male sex. My brothers it is time for a change! No longer can this burden fall on Men but must be shared by the likes of all of humanity!\"\n\nThe men looked around the table. Some visible upset or apprehensive...\n\n\"As the Head of the Order it is my responsibility to appoint the new cleric...Elena my dear, please come in\"\n\n-------------\n\nHello! I'm Elena. \n\nWhat a wonderfully written prompt! I couldn't be helped but be drawn in to the lore of this world. World building is one of my absolute favorite things in roleplay and reading through your prompt made me think of all sorts of things about this world you created. \n\nThe premise behind my message to you would be that the order has chosen a female cleric for the first time. After centuries of your character seeing nothing but a male cleric, I think a women would make for an interesting change. \n\nMy favorite kinks are but not limited to: non consent, impregnation, bondage, mind control, body modification, medical experiments, sexual torture, risky sex, condom play, huge amounts of cum, facials, creampies, heavy bondage, clothing control, orgasm control/denial, grool, large cocks, hairy pussy, musk.\n\nMy only hard limit is scat.\n\nAs you can see I have no issues with the dark and sadistic kinks. Snuff, torture, are more than fine with me. \n\nI would love to brainstorm with you and create something exciting. \n\nIf you happen to use discord I'm also available there. \n\nDiscord: Elena#9678",
