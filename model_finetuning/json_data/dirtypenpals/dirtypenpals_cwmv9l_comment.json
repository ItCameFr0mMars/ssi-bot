Speak to him, and start off with telling him that this has been a developing kink for you, and that related to that, you think this is happening.  If you START with that, he might get defensive, but a \"I'm starting to learn I like this fetish, and I think it's because of what I think is happening,\" he might be less likely to deny it.\n\nGetting it into the open doesn't mean it has to not be \"cheating\" anymore.  You can tell him you want him to keep it secret from you from now on...not tell you when he sees her, basically pretend he's still cheating, but knowing you're okay with it.  I don't know if that would still take away some of the appeal, but it might work.\n\nBest of luck!  Please update the sub with any new info.",
