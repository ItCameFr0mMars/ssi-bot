It's very likely not personal. Just gotta move on.\n\nI mean, the main things for any relationship are being patient, and proactive. Posting, and responding to posts often mean more opportunities for that perfect match. Sorting by new definitely helps too, in case a post gets popular, alternatively, you can try messaging someone on days in between when they post and ask if they're open for something. \n\nThen it's a matter of really selling yourself to them. There's a fine line between enthusiastic and desperate, and finding it can be tricky unless you can read for the clues in their posts. I've finally found a long term RP partner for something after a month and a half of trying consistently to respond to posts and RPers who struck me as the type (generally) I was looking for. Just gotta keep trying. There are a lot of people here with a lot of creativity, just a matter of hitting the right note at the right time with the right person.",

If you send me a message asking to RP on any of those, you will be put on the block list and tagged through RES so I don't have to deal with it again. Sorry, it probably sounds harsh, but I've had too many of those to want to deal with them anymore.\n\nCould I get more partners if I opened my search up to other platforms? Without a doubt, I'm very strict on what I use. But while I could get people on other platforms, that'd make rp harder on me, since I'd have to juggle normal reddit DM's, having my web discord rp account open in a tab at all times, and having a reddit tab open at all times to have chat updates, with the latter two possibly not producing any results while I have them open.\n\nThe benefit, in my opinion, would not be worth the cost. I can only do one of those on mobile (reddit dm's, since my discord has my main account and my reddit app doesn't have a chat function because chat was a mistake of a feature) so the latter two would be restricted to only when I'm at home.\n\nPlus, I only like kik for certain styles of rp, and I can't stand chat because the entire thing is just hot garbage.\n\n---\n\nthat was a big rant, hope it conveyed my point lol",

Not a hundred, so I'm gonna look like a crazy guy just jumping on ranting, but here we go. It'll come outta nowhere but; \n\nI been on here like a few weeks maybe? And from just a **few weeks** of doing this, here's what I was prepared to put meta, watch how crazy I got, I had to write it down and send it to myself to vent the anger and stop myself doing a meta rant, okay look;\n\n**\\[META\\] A Rant From My Few Experiences.**\n\nOkay, wow.\n\nI know none of these are official rules and this is like, whiney bullshit?\n\nBut they're the kind of thing that you'd assume would go unsaid, y'know, basic decency and acknowledging and dealing with who messages you. This is gonna be a pissed off rant, but fuck me people are impolite.\n\nSo many posts \\[F4M\\] \\[F4A\\] saying they want people who are descriptive and write more than one word sentences, saying shit like\n\n&gt;I don't mind messages that are short and sweet, but one sentence isn't likely to tell me enough about you to get me interested\n\nAnd **not even replying to one that they're not interested**. Won't even reply with 'Sorry! Found someone! Hope you find who you're looking for!' Not even the most curt 'Not interested.' I got like two of those outta maybe twenty messages to all different people. \n\n1. So. Many. Ghostings... after like one day when I specifically ask for long term and someone says they're down for it, it'll be one message next day, then me asking if they wanna go on, them saying yes... then...? After some good RP! I message again, ending with two messages from me and nothing else from them. Isn't it the most basic to just say you're not into it, or too busy? Just say short term! \n\n2. So. Picky. Not only are there people with the tiniest kink and limits lists saying they're basically open for anything- who then say no not that eww-! Halfway into messaging, but I spent like two hours with someone hacking out the logistics of who they want, what they like about the fantasy, after they messaged me, only to find out they don't like me writing too much?! For writing three paragraphs for my reply to her one?! \n\nAlso, what the fuck is this shit\\*? This is for PORN, SIMULATED FUCKING, not your fucking rejected fantasy novel.\n\n\\-----------\n\n\\*Now- important to note there are links for things like 'what the fuck is this shit', but I didn't finish it 'cause I got the anger out and was seeing that it was valid, but I didn't wanna shame people for having preferences. Main thing with that was, someone had a prompt for 'writing a story together'? Worldbuilding?! \n\nLike aww so you want me to help you with your unpublished novel! How is that gonna make my cock cum, working stressed on a fucking book for free?\n\nSo if I were to formulate the problems, a glance at your profile for example (and keep in mind, I got like very few partners and most ghosting me so I'm no authority givin' you tips, well done getting six months in!);\n\n\\&gt; I'm really looking for a guy who knows how to carry a conversation \n\nCould sound condescending. The **assumption should be** that a guy can carry a conversation, not that he needs to be like, told to sit up straight or whatever. \n\nI see that, and so many sentences like 'NO one sentences please! I need a guy who's articulate, verbose, can keep up with an intelligent, intellectual...' \n\naaaaand my eyes are glazed over and I feel like my single friend's asking why she's single when she has high standards and expects her guy to. \n\nAnd isn't that what everyone wants, deep down? To be reminded that if they want sexy stuff that they have to do more, wait longer than just getting pornhub and clicking twice, while the other person promises no such effort on their part, beyond the insult that they have a high opinion of themselves but no examples in post of sexy words like 'cock' or 'tits' or 'looking for someone so I can make them feel sexy or do sex acts that can only be given by me writing them'? Nah girls, keep thinkin' you're hot shit for taking so much longer to trust and even start to show any sexy side in the safest fucking platform possible; writing a fucking RP without any strings attached. Like Jesus Christ amount o' hoops to jump through to just get to fucking, and then you would be gobsmacked at the girls you message who say that, don't message back, or if they do, they have spelling mistakes edited on discord, and \n\n'Like, I don't get it ?! Sorry it's just, you threw so muhc at me, I don't like, get where we are or what we're doing? Haha'.\n\nLike wow, really? This has happened more than once, and I'm like, girl you messaged me!",

            "body": "PART 2: This is gonna sound sexist, but take a look at \\[F4M\\] posts and just see how condescending, downright insulting and demanding the jabs at guys intelligence are. Like seriously, scroll it and just look for stuff like, \n\n'Don't even bother if it's just one sentence.' 'I'm not carrying this myself.' 'If you're not \\_\\_\\_ then don't even \\_\\_\\_' \n\nLike yeah- the assumption is that we won't do that, if upfront your attitude while looking for someone to **make feel sexy** is to tell them 'don't be every other guy, y'know, in that way that you're inarticulate and I'm just doing so much?', (with no examples of your sexy writing in post) and remind them of like, Tinder standards while they're most likely looking to escape that and just simulate fucking or vanilla romance and then eventual fucking, it's not exactly the best way to start anything, let alone a long term thing. You couldn't pay me to stay long term in something where another girl is teasing like I have to do a bunch of shit and she doesn't to get sex. Even fake sex! Fucking great. Jesus...\n\n'I have standards and straight up insult based on my perception of myself as sexy when I just use long words that aren't turn ons and might not give you simulated sex until like, weeks into knowing you when you may well just be horny now!'\n\nOn something called **DIRTY PENPALS**. START with sex, and **show people you'll make an effort to turn partners on before lecturing them.**\n\nGod forbid I could find someone who'll not lecture at all...\n\n(And I realise the irony me doing this, I don't mean you! Just cumulative pissed off due to my experiences here, guy posts can be stupid too.)\n\nThis is gonna sound outright backed up sexist, but I've messaged almost exclusively either paragraphs to every prompt, or link my prompt with paragraphs and demands + kinklist linked in it to like, thirty people now? Got maybe three back? Messaging like loads short term when I asked for long, and then maybe one message next day saying sorry and they wanna keep going... then nothing. And I'm always the last message in the posts. \n\nI don't know if there's some misconception that women (I haven't messaged men so... don't know, but just glancing at the posts) if women think reprimanding, insulting, condescending, playing up that they're 'articulate' 'need a man who can keep up' sorta shit is like appealing?! Like, as if that's a turn on and will make a guy feel like \n\n'Ooh now there's a strong woman who'll make me feel good if only I got over my dumb man ways and tried more and was more articulate and also spent more time reading words like 'member' and 'my flower'!' But it's just the same real life reminder slap in the face of standards.\n\nAlso, you put RP/friendship on your last post, that at first sight is like a smack of me feeling '*I do not want to be your friend*'.\n\nI don't intend to go on at you, your post was fantastic and thank you for making this one! You were personable, cute, but like, I'd say long term RP, just lead with some form of like, *some* promise of sex and sexy words? And a specific heading of scene or two archetypes. If it's vanilla romance, is it Best Friends? Cause that looks really good!\n\nYou mentioned being Black, but didn't say straight up if you're into raceplay or not at all. I had to look at your kinklist, and it said 'Not Entered', I assume means no? I'd put even with the kinklist, in the post;\n\nKinks; Skinny Guys, Big Dicks, Hand-holding, Face-sitting, Toys, Exhibitionism, Being disciplined, Lingerie, Stockings, Teasing you...xx \n\nLimits; NO raceplay.\n\nSomething like that. This particular post is what this post is, and someone can message with their kinklist, but also, examples of what they might do to you, the Kinks; Limits thing encourages that;\n\nHey! So... heard you were looking for a friend? ;) So... I think we're pretty compatible (Kinklist) but I was wondering how long you wanted to keep going before we got fucking? Like, look, I love best friends! I had an idea about like, what if I tied you up after prom, I took you but I'm not sure if you actually like me...\n\nEtc. People like **blocked** words and good format. Like concise, be real, what are you actually looking for?\n\n**My Best Friend has a Big Dick.**\n\n**(A brief description of what turns you on about it and suggestions for what you could do in one specific scene)**\n\nAnd then maybe a few for options of where you'd wanna start, or all the things that could be in the long term run. Remember, you're showing off how hot you are in speech, best way is to get someone hard in the body of the post.\n\n'But I'm not sure if I'm ready for that! I have to trust them!'\n\nKINKS; HAND-HOLDING. TRUST.\n\n**Hand-Holding**\n\nI... have a confession to make... ;P When a boy loves and respects me... when he takes his firm hand and just... presses it into my... soft little hand and just... MMPH tells me he's nervous? And that he values me and respects me? Well... gets me wet, is all I'm sayin'... xx PM how you'd hold my hand! I'm really good at it too...\n\nEtc whatever but what do I know I got like no-one with my prompts and I go on for ages.\n\nYou know, I appreciate that it can be for friendship first and on the more romantic side, but maybe some preview through specific sexy scenarios and like, with your post, describe with tantalising words- \n\nYou like receiving cunnilingus? 'Looking for someone to be my friend! I've always wanted a BFF... so I can sit on his face? ;)'\n\nAnd I'm the last person should be saying this but, just going on your most recent post, it went on a bit long and the format was a little meandering, a LOT of text. Yeah, I know, the nerve on me right? :D Bold titles, blocked like subheadings and maybe different scene scenarios, be clear you want long term, but don't focus on all the hang-ups and hoops people'll have to jump through to get you. Focus on what they'll get, and show them how they're not hoops they're going through, if you really need 'em at all, make 'em into something else! Rather than upfront insecurity and how difficult it's gonna be to maybe get long term friendship?! On dpp? Go for how hot it'll be when the friends get together!\n\nAnyway, I'm glad someone else feels it. Thought I was going crazy.\n\nHope you find someone!",

I've had countless others end in a heartbreaking [deleted] that was usually preceded by \"i'm having so much fun with this!!!\"\n\nI know I personally have gotten pickier over time. I won't reply to accounts that are less than ~1 month old. I won't message on prompts that don't show some writing ability. I'll say no thanks if our kinks diverge too much. I had one play with an intelligent, enthusiastic poster that I had to put a stop to because they had a very clear image of how the story should go and replying to them made me feel anxious because I knew they'd change 3-5 things about every post I made.\n\nBut then, right now, I have two roleplays going with the same person that are really enjoyable, and they've been going on for months. I'm hoping they stay interested, because that kind of easy roleplay relationship is hard to find.",

            "body": "I'll speak from experience here and say that the biggest thing that draws me to a partner is a clear and consistent effort. I look at post histories, I take in your first message/response, it all matters to me. If I look through your history and see a bunch of very short prompts, or low effort musings about what you might want without any real solid idea, I'm generally not going to be interested. \n\nFor me long term means very long. A couple of replies a day, several paragraphs in the reply to provide detail and move the story forward without controlling the other person. The list can go on for what I feel qualifies as detailed and interesting. But the biggest thing is effort and some sense of what you want to do. I've had people come at me with the barest amount of thought and they clearly weren't willing to put in any more than that, and right away I know we won't click. \n\nI think the most important thing of all is to try and find a partner you think you'll mesh with. If you want to do paragraphs of replies over a long time frame, find someone who posts in that form, or specifically mentions it. If you're looking for something more rapid fire, be up front about that. And come forward with an idea more fleshed out than \"My character wants to fuck yours\" or similar. Having a general story already in mind gives the impression that you've put thought and effort into this going in, and it makes you a lot more likely to stand out. Even if your potential partner doesn't want that exact story, they're more likely, in my eyes, to respond at all, and that could get the ball rolling towards something you both want. \n\nAll in all though, it really is a numbers game. I've had a lot of trash replies from people that I either ignored or just told no to right away. I've had some who seemed great to start and then either vanished or started to go downhill and made the whole roleplay a bore. I've had probably about ten to fifteen roleplays out of hundreds of replies, both sent to me and sent by me, that actually went anywhere and were fun, and of those only a handful actually went to any sort of real conclusion, or are still running. If you think you have a good idea in mind, if you've got a story you want to play, just keep trying to get it out there and eventually you're bound to find someone you click with.",

I didn't say that, she mentioned it in the post and I was going back into one to get a reference as to why she might be having problems finding someone. The post I saw, right before she put one up asking what she was doing wrong (went to for reference to try to help) I looked for problems and spoke from experience, people putting \n\nKinks;\n\nLimits;\n\nHelps. To *specify*. If you mention colour in a post, I assume it means something, and yes, if someone mentioned they were white I'd wonder if they were into raceplay, otherwise why specify colour? 'I'm a white girl' is different to focusing on something else 'I'm 4'2' ;)'. Other wise why mention it? Anything you mention, you did for a reason, something to potentially play with. \n\nLike, the larger point there was her putting kinks or limits. If I put 'I'm playing an average and normal dude' and someone messaged going, 'hey, so are you black or white or into raceplay?' I wouldn't be insulted, they're asking to specify what to play with. I was looking for anything in her post to help her. \n\nAnd that was like, a tiny part of my point. My point was like, really venting (crazily, but it's up now) about what people might be doing wrong. Like she literally asked. You wanna play a character, you say, you wanna be 'you' you say for a reason. In my opinion she needed to specify and be concise. Most of my ramblings (which I mentioned like several times in text I knew were ironic so yeah, clever calling me out while I was still trying to help, actually bringing up points she made and mentioned it to you, '*Ironic, no?*', no yeah. Yeah I knew.) were from pent up tension about what so many people are doing wrong here, just in case there was anything that could be improved.\n\nYou set up a character, be precise, put in what you want focused on, and there you go.
