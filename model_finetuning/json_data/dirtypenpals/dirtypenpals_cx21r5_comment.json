Then one thing leads to another, life gets busy and by the time I have do make it back sometimes weeks have passed.  I feel bad about it and usually offer apologies but even if they are still around it's hard to pick an RP up again after so much time has passed. \n\nOne the plus side it's given me some good perspective for when I get ghosted in turn, which happens regularly.  Knowing it's happened to me before I choose to believe life has simply gotten busy for them and don't hold it against them.  In the end I take each day as it comes on here.  If a hot RP is dropped I'm disappointed, of course, but I just let it go and move on.  I don't think anyone is trying to be malicious or mean about it, it just happens.",

Additionally, I know that sometimes the person might have gotten off during the chat, or even the opposite and gotten completely bored, and have decided to bail. \nGhosting after you\u2019ve ended a roleplay session doesn\u2019t bother me at all. There are so many reasons it can happen that I just don\u2019t get upset about it. What does bother me is when it happens in the middle of the roleplay. Especially if I haven\u2019t gotten off yet. \nI make a habit of when I get off I keep the roleplay or chat going until I actually have to go, the other person makes it clear they got off too, or they just stop messaging anyway. However, more often then not I\u2019m not that deep into the roleplay or chat and don\u2019t have the chance to finish before I\u2019m ghosted. Then I\u2019m just waiting for a message that\u2019s not going to come. \nThat\u2019s what bothers me. If you want to go, give me literally any excuse you want. Tell me the truth, or lie as to why you\u2019re going, but just let me know so that I\u2019m not keeping an eye out for a message that\u2019s not going to come. Anytime I have to go, I always make sure to say because I don\u2019t want the person to wonder when my next message will come, only to never get it. \nSo that\u2019s my suggestion to people at the end of this long rant: if you are done roleplaying, be it being busy, having finished, being totally bored, or even if you get offended, just let them know that you\u2019re done. Tell them whatever you want to tell them, it can even be: \u201cSorry, I gotta go, bye!\u201d And then they don\u2019t sit there waiting and waiting.",

            "body": "&gt; Do you think a discussion about why ghosting is so common help anyone feel better about it or about themselves? \n\nIt might help a small number of people, but the average person who gets ghosted and then expresses their feelings about it - open threads, metas about it - seems (my opinion) angry that it happens at *all*. A lot of people seem to think that unless there's a threat to life or safety, or flagrant disrespect, there's no reason to ghost. No number of reasonable explanations are ever going to placate them. \n\nGhosting will always be a thing. There is nothing to be done about it: the community's only option is to change the norms to make ghosting culturally unacceptable (which requires coordination on a scale that simply isn't possible - folks still leave comments like 'PM me'). The mods have more putative options, but enacting them isn't feasible: it would ultimately be reliant on people reporting inappropriate ghosting, and verifying that the ghosting wasn't, in fact, merited, simply isn't in the realm of possibility, to say *nothing* of the difficulties the mod team would have in coming up with a definition of 'reasonable' ghosting.\n\nIMO, the best thing to be done is a strong response from active/prominent community members that while ghosting sucks, everyone has a right to stop writing with anyone else at any time without any explanation or warning, and that respecting that right is paramount. That might move the window of acceptability on discussions, and maybe, in turn, change the general attitude.",

Usually a friendly \u201chey, you still around?\u201d bumps it back to the top of my inbox and reminds me. \n\nAnother reason I ghost is when I\u2019m not even playing my character. I had an RP that seems to be going well, it was flirty with some great back and forth. Then the sex scene started. What I received was a wall of text narrating the entire thing. I was told what my character did in bed and how it was. Everything. And the narration ended when the sex was over and we were both laying in bed. I had nothing to reply at that point, so I just didn\u2019t. \n\nMy suggestion to people being ghosted is to send a quick reminder after a few days. I usually wait 4 days or so then send one reminder. After that I assume they\u2019ve either bailed on this RP or their whole account.",

I'm passive aggressive and annoying about it now, but it's kinda made the whole thing a turn-off. Being cordial, clicking, getting a great RP, having someone genuinely apologetic they're busy...\n\nThere's nothing to be done.\n\nI just want one message if someone doesn't want to go on. I don't get why someone can have the time to write the lines of prompt and then entire paragraphs of RP, but not one line saying, \n\n'Oh! Sorry, too life's getting too busy and it's been too long, don't think I wanna continue.'. That's all, just a glance at Reddit, like I don't get why someone would defend ghosting because someone's 'just busy', like what? Someone has time to put a prompt up, they ask for Long Term, or they reply to someone asking Long Term, and then.... \n\n?\n\nI hate when people put messages saying 'Sorry! Life's getting really busy, promise I'll get back to you! Try tonight?'\n\nAnd then I'm like, yeah sure take your time, and then get nothing. That's even worse! I get people can't predict what's gonna happen, but like, I've got good RPs, and I dunno if they're coming back after what, four days and wanna keep going? With something where the characters are halfway through kissing in the middle of the night, with like, ten or more string of messages five minutes apart of passion?\n\nI got crazy angry and ranted about this, but I'm learning this is just a kinda awful place to try and get off when there's so much free porn on the internet.\n\nI'd just ask for like, one line of if you don't wanna go on. If you actually do but things actually are busy, isn't that just the same? Just like, I dunno, some sorta schedule flair for prompts or something. Can do nights, going every night for weeks or months etc, but whatever, that'd be ridiculous to try and ensure.\n\nBut still, 'long term' shouldn't mean I have to assume it's at most one post every few days or something, unless specifically told that. And who would go for something that's meant to turn you on and be a running in-the-moment affair, when it's just sensory whiplash in two hopeful messages, and then days of refreshing for nothing? People find the RP they like, leave the rest hanging. No rules to stop that. It should be under 'etiquette' or just 'don't be a dick' or something. \n\nBut there's no way to do that. 'Umm, throwaway because wtf?! Why did I get banned when I wanted to go on but I waited two days and then got reported?!'\n\nThat'd be like, a *dream* for messaging with people who put prompts up, if you put a prompt up asking for specific time intervals and then miss them and don't message, that's like, cause for you not being trustworthy or something.\n\nBut that's what you'd get, 'wtf?!'. Couldn't enforce it, and people who wanna RP but are a tiny bit too slow could get it ruined for no reason. Nothing to be done.",
