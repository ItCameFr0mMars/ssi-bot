            "body": "Occasional domme here. Maybe my perspective can still be useful. Dudes: let me know if anything I'm about to say makes sense to you.\n\n\"Dominance\" and \"submission\" come in a lot of flavours, and these relationships involve a lot of powerful emotions.  BDSM communities have worked hard to give us scripts to follow furnish us with spaces where our desires can be expressed and play can be negotiated safely, and \"dominant\" and \"submissive\" form part of the lexicon adopted by that culture. People perform \"dominance\" and \"submission\" to legitimize their desires. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, because that's exactly why those words exist. However, you hit upon an important point. It is potentially valid to want to have sexy times with inexperienced people, but what does it say about us and why do we sometimes want it?\n\nBDSM allows us to make connections that fuel feelings of intensity, intimacy, and vulnerability that would meet instant rejection outside the BDSM community. Some people want that.\n\nBDSM ALSO allows us to indulge, for fun, some of the dark and primitive elements of our humanity. If you're a sadist, or you've been with a good one, you know exactly what I mean. Not everything worth feeling feels good, and not everything pleasurable is motivated purely by kindness.\n\nWith that said, that's the ideal. Loads of people are not ideal. They seek the use of BDSM to legitimize what they want and how they go about it, but they're not necessarily paragons of perfectly responsible, broadly experienced dominance and submission. Loads of people here have never been dominant in real life play, or they don't know for sure that they have shared experience or expectations with people who have been exploring themselves a long time in a different country or region (or just a different club or website). It may be easier to perform dominance with someone who has no firm idea what to expect, especially if you're not actually confident or comfortable being compared to your submissive's previous dominants. They can't judge you while you learn, or so you might convince yourself.\n\nAs a shy, introverted domme who has muchly struggled to get over herself, I can relate to that. I want to be the gardener tending to my sub's needs, creating scenarios and playing roles, finding interesting ways to create new exquisite suffering and give them a well-deserved release from whatever tension troubles them: responsibility, frustration, the demands of their own self-image... whatever. I like to find ways for them to be useful to me. I enjoy being the restraint and the iron will against which they struggle, gratefully frustrated. For me, it's like being a massage therapist for the mind: finding my sub's mental knots and working them until the pain turns to pleasure. Experience has made it possible for me to do that with an experienced sub, but if you don't have the experience and/or you don't how to master \\*yourself\\*, your insecurity, your own lack of confidence, then some people think they can't credibly perform dominance except with someone as or more inexperienced as they are.\n\n... and some people probably just like fucking inexperienced people because it's part of the power dynamic for them, and that's fine in principle.\n\n... and some people just like to play the nurturing domme, and for them it's easier for them to feel comfortable in the teacher role.\n\n... and some of us just like to see a person come into themselves.\n\n... and some people are probably just looking for victims who won't recognize abuse, and that's not fine at all.\n\nSo to me it's not necessarily a sign of laziness or irresponsibility. It could mean a lot of things.",

            "body": "While I've never specifically searched for inexperienced partners, I do generally enjoy roles where my partner is at least playing someone inexperienced ( But I also enjoy it when I am as well.) And I think that for me it's about that exploration. I enjoy that aspect in dom/sub relationships as 'someone' is exploring something new. That corruption aspect. Though I do note I've always felt like a 'different' type of dom, or at least the ones that seem most prevalent/in demand here. What I mean by that is I don't have much interest in a TPE relationship. Or anything really close to that. Both in real life and in RPs I enjoy the very casual side of BDSM and Domming. While I've had some great experiences in real life with more 'experienced' subs and doing the more 'intense' stuff, as I said I just don't think many of them are looking for the type of stuff I've kind of grown to enjoy. So while I don't look for inexperienced subs, my type of RPs seem to attract them.\n\nSorry if this post makes no sense or has grammar issues, I've been up for 3 days straight working. If there are any questions, shoot.",

            "body": "I tend to prefer experienced partners most of the time, but I have sought out inexperienced, shy, or awkward partners here before too. Particularly online where inexperience isn't such a barrier to a good time, as you can be inexperienced but still be a fantastic writer. \n\nFor me being dominant is about leading an experience for you and your partner(s). Ultimately the best experiences in bed can be had when both people are able to let go, feel safe (to the degree that they want to feel safe), comfortable, and be able to express their desires fully. \n\nWhen I take a dominant role, that's my goal: Make my sub(s) feel comfortable enough to express themselves completely. \n\nThere's a wonderful feeling to be had when you help someone get out of their shell, and open up about their kinks and fantasies in ways they haven't felt comfortable enough to do before. \n\nSo the reason I've sought out inexperienced/shy/awkward partners here before is precisely that. The fact that you're on DPP of all places, and responding to a prompt seeking shy partners, tells me you have a lot you want to get out. You're kinky, you have the filthy mind, and you haven't been able to express it fully yet, but you WANT to. So that gives me an opportunity to try and make that happen :) \n\nOf course that's just me, and I'm sure others who've made such posts have their own motivations, some that make sense, some that are probably just plain creepy. I think it comes down to the post/person in question.",
