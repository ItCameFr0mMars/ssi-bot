            "body": "The  Bard finds a grand looking tome within the Lich\u2019s lair. Unable to  resist she begins to read. Unfortunate for her that the arcane script is  a cursed text written by the Lich\u2019s own hand. She is pulled into those  enchanted pages to join the plot of the story within as if in a dream.  The text skitters and changes to include her in its narrative. Even more  unfortunate for her \u2013 it was the Lich\u2019s fanfic erotica she must now  endure.\n\n\\--\n\nA  blob, jet black and tiny catches one of the women by the ankle. Within  moments the viscous ebony fluid flows over the Woman's body melting away  clothing in favor of its own mass. It sheathes her body in a flawless  layer of glossy black not unlike latex or rubber. Within the dark blob  forces a length of itself into its new host's vagina. Without a dark  mass forms upon her crotch, the creature snatching a memory from its  victim's mind to faithfully reproduce the visage of the cock she had  drawn the most pleasure from - a cock that tingles and throbs, sensitive  as the real thing.\n\n\\--\n\nThe  Rogue, rather imprudently, reads some ancient runes aloud, not heeding  the priestess's warning about sleeping guardians. A demon, angel, or  chthonian outsider appears, and will only overlook the trespass if one  of the party surrender their flesh for an hour or so, so that the  guardian's centuries-long lust might be sated.\n\n\\--\n\nThe  Warrior and druid hit it off, sneaking off to a secluded corner of the  dungeon alone.  During intercourse, at the Warrior\u2019s request the male  Druid shapeshifts into a variety of forms, including wolf, horse, bear,  owl warg, and more to sate his warrior woman.\n\n\\--\n\nThe  Mage and The Bard end up separated from the rest by a revolving door.  Hours later, tired, hungry and thirst the pair make camp and pass around  the rations and refreshments. The Mage accidently - or perhaps  \u201caccidently\u201d - hands the Bard a flask containing one of his homemade  potions rather than the one containing water. The transformative elixir  works its magic, leaving the Elven Bard greater of chest, broader of  bottom and as airheaded as a Goblin. Maybe the Mage should have left his  patented \u201cBimbo Brew\u201d at home. Oh well - it is his fetish, best make  the best of it.\n\n\\--\n\nIn  a gallery of erotic statues, a golem lurks. The party realizes too late  that the golem can leap from body to body, using his fluid nature to  satisfy each party member. He was built for pleasure, after all.",

            "body": "Two of our fateful adventurers slake their thirst with the waters of an  ornate fountain deep within the bowels of the dungeon. Little do they  know they gulp down an enchanted elixir. Not unlike the love potions of  fairy tales they are doomed to fall hopelessly and completely in love  with the next thing they see. More so, the magics of the fountain will  gift their love with 'congruence', in other words it will make their  love work no matter the implication. The lovers will be able to lay with  one another no matter how stark their differences. They will be able to  breed whether their genetic make up is compatible or not. Fairy tale  may have you believe this fountain to be the origin of the centaur or  the Dragon-kin, who knows for sure? Will our heroes look upon one  another or some other creature that has already quenched its thirst?\n\n\\--\n\nA  cavern overgrown with tiny white mushrooms so thick it is impossible to  set one's foot down without crushing three. The shades of the dead  drift listless over the mushroom glade the mushroom caps glowing a pale  purple in their wake. The Shades take a particular interest in the  living, vessels of warmth that can feel and indulge in all the wonderful  things they can not in their death. The Priestess knows the Shades  yearn to possess mortal flesh once more but are harmless so long as one  does not willingly give up their mind to the shades. In the dark the  dead whisper promises of treasure and pleasure, the hallucinogenic  affects of the mushroom spores kicked airborn by the passing of heavy  boots making their whispers seem all the more tantalizing. How  feverishly hedonistic the indulgences of the Shades would be if they  managed to take control of and possess a warm body once more.\n\n\\--\n\nThe Rogue finds himself separated from the party, stumbling upon a room  ripe with vegetation not unlike a pumpkin patch. The fruiting vines  coiled and twisting upon the dungeon floor yield massive beach  ball-sized orbs like naked peaches. After looking them over he finds  each nectar dripping fruit is embellished with a vagina-like orifice.  With no prying eyes about and never one for much self control he spends  all afternoon fucking each and every one. A day later the fruits burst  open, releasing masses of mischievous juvenile faerie-like creatures  that have his hair and eyes.\n\n\\--\n\nThe party find themselves at a dead end, an enchanted door barring their  way. The Druid has the solution, transforming into a small rodent he  scurries through the cracks in the wall seeking the mechanism that might  open the door. On his way the Druid encounters a tiny buxom fairy,  mischievous and mirthful beckoning him to join her. Strange, the Druid  could swear her eyes were the exact same strange shade of gold as their  resident Rogue\u2019s\u2026\n\n\\--\n\nThe Bard sings a ballad of love and loss to her friends one night around  the campfire. Her song is joined by a second voice a solo act becoming a  duet. So beguiling was our Bard\u2019s voice that she unwittingly attracted a  Siren from the deep dark. The party now bound in enchanted sleep the  Bard must now face the supremely sexual creature alone. Can she resist  magic\u2019s greatest temptations?\n\nThe High Elven Mage stumbles upon the workshop of his racial enemy, the  Drow. After blundering through her things for a few minutes she appears,  catching him in the act. The ashen skinned sorceress immobilizes him  with a spell, then gleefully tells him all the nasty things her ogre  bodyguard will do to him. Frowning, the elf offers an alternative:  \"Don't you have anything with tentacles instead?\"\n\n\\--\n\nDeep underground, the party finds a strange mechanical device of Dwarven  make. The odd machine has clearly been tampered with, modified  extensively by the dungeon\u2019s new inhabitants. The rogue determines that  it has been hooked up to the door to the lower floor, but can't figure  out what it does, exactly. The party\u2019s Dwarven Priestess smiles and  climbs into the stirrups, ordering the rest of the party man the cranks -  she knows a Dwarven pleasure machine when she sees one, even if this  one is old and probably has a few new surprised jury rigged into its  workings!\n\n\\--\n\nThe Warrior and the Priestess venture deeper into the dungeon alone after  being separated from the men when the rogue failed to notice a pit trap  only to clutch in his desperation to the mage's robes the pair  unceremoniously tumbling into the dark. Ahead, natural light joins the  flicker of their torches, piercing the dark; their first glimpse of the  sun in days. The claustrophobic corridors open into an enormous natural  fissure. Rough lime stone walls stretch far and away above open to the  mid day sky, the cave ceiling having been eroded and shaped by a now  diverted river. Little do they know they've stumbled into the laid of a  adolescent Displacer Beast in the midst of breeding season; sunlight  rendering it utterly invisible.\n\nMeanwhile  - The boys, far below, are drawn to another light altogether. The  glitter of gold tempts greedy souls. Down stone hewn steps they tread  into the lair of a Medusa queen who promises them gold should they but  lay with her for an hour and stone if they dare refuse.\n\n\\--\n\nThe Warrior finds an ancient drinking hall, long abandoned with the  skeletons of the previous revelers scattered about. All at once she is  set upon by the ghosts of the partygoers who believe she is another  guest. She is plied with intoxicating ghost wine until she ends up with  her pants off, legs in the air, panting brainlessly as the ghost train  lays down several miles of track.\n\n\\--\n\nIn her flight to escape a gang of naughty Gnolls, the warrior stumbles and  tumbles down a pit trap into a poorly lit cavernous grotto inhabited by  slimes! The Oozlings harbour a particular and prurient interest in  feminine flesh. Specifically they like dissolving the clothes off  adventurers to get at the soft nubile curves beneath only to envelope  their now naked bodies up to the neck and use the floating objects in  their gelatinous forms to show any hapless heroine that stumbled into  their home a good time!\n\n\\--\n\nDuring a rest around the fire, the companions discuss their friends and family  back home. The Dwarven priestess reveals that she has five children,  all but the youngest fully grown. She reveals perhaps a touch too much  about Dwarven culture and their predisposition towards incestuous  activities. In gratuitous detail she shares a tale in which her oldest  son fires virile young seed deep into her fertile womb only to go on to  explain the encounter as the moment she found her god. Now priestess and  paragon of \u2018The  Great Mother\u2019 she embodies all of its tenants. The  Rogue, his head swimming with sordid tales is visited by embarrassing  dreams of his own Mother.\n\n\\--\n\nThe day after the Priestess' scandalous stories of her homestead sowed the  seeds of incest in the Rogue's mind he stumbled across a familiar  silhouette in the dark. A Succubus, having probed the young man's mind  appears to him having assumed the visage of his own Mother. Eager to  feed on the man\u2019s potent and lust laden daydreams she seduces him. Hours  later, the demon having taken her fill she takes her leave of the  dungeon having caught a new scent, that of the Rogue's real Mother, for  the scent of the Woman lingered still when she kissed his forehead for  luck a fortnight past. The succubus pays the Rogue\u2019s Mother a visit,  assuming the form of her son, the lust demon eager to deposit a bounty  of incubated cum within her womb - the very same seed donated by the  Rogue himself.",
