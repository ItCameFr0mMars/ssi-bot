Most people, but not me.  I hated it.  Sure I used my diagnosis to prey on the people around me,  but they were not really like me.  I was an outsider peering in.  I moved them around, manipulated them, shore them of green wool.    I was wealthy.  Still, I was always on guard.  I couldn't ever let anyone know who or what I truly was.  \n\nThen it blindsided us.  It killed millions.  The fire storms killed billions more.  Then starvation set in.  It is shocking how many people can't survive unless the food is ready to serve, and the microwave has power.  It was my kind of world.  Predators, animal and human feasted on the corpse of what was once society.  Our numbers increased.  Now, things are no longer safe.  Which is probably why you are so careful.  Still i caught your scent and soon I intend to catch more of you.....\n\nIf this turns you on get in touch, add a little to this new world.",
