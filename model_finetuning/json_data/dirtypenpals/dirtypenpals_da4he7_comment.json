            "body": "Hi Hanna!  I\u2019m Mike :) I love the sound of your horny dryad / flower-girl on the hunt for men to have her way with!  I\u2019m thinking she needs sperm for some reason \u2014 perhaps her body processes make it difficult for her to synthesize certain compounds, so, like the Venus fly trap, she has to get them from other sources \u2014 in this case, by hunting and trapping men.  However, she also enjoys seeing the men who cause so much damage to the plant world helplessly in her thrall, so she sometimes goes hunting even when she doesn\u2019t technically need anything at all, other than the thrill of the chase.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of particularly harsh, brutal femdom, but I do love the more gentle aspects, as well as anything involving restraint, milking, edging, forced orgasms, hypnosis and control (maybe her pussy produces a sweet nectar that is mildly hypnotic aphrodisiac and binds him to her?), gags, etc.",
