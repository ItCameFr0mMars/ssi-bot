Anyone can use this for one of your prompts.\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassSmackAndSlide\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock\n\nYou're the newest recruit for the army, drafted to join the upcoming war. There's just one problem: you're the biggest, fattest piece of shit around. The sergeant says that if he shot you, the bullet would be absorbed between the fat roll holding that pizza slice you lost five years ago, and the other roll holding your emergency box of donuts.\n\nUnfortunately for you, war doesn't require \"obese whales,\" in the Sarge's words. So you've been put on a harsh training regiment. It's another scorcher today. You've been jogging for twenty miles and your spirit is nearly broken. As your jog ends and you return to base, a single sound fills you with hope and joy.\n\nThe dinner bell.\n\nYou muster up what energy you have and full on sprint to the mess hall. Nothing can stop you--you knock away recruit and commanding officers away with the greatest of ease. You feel your body moving faster and faster as you draw near, flames beginning to surround your body and burn off your uniform (again) from the intense speed and heat.\n\nYou didn't even feel the impact when you suddenly stopped. You just found yourself pressed against the glass doors, the entire cafeteria and inhabitants staring at your naked body. Damn these pull doors stopping you from getting your food!\n\nWhat you didn't realize, however, is that your sergeant was right behind you...",
