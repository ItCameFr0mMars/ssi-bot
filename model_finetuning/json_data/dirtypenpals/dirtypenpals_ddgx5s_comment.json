            "body": "Somewhat by default limits limit your options, so need to explore alternatives or just live with less input.  If you feel too limited in your RP options and that your pen pal is annoyed your responses are too terse, best to bring it up with them directly rather than avoid the issue and let it pile into a big issue.\n\nEveryone has different expectations for pose length, quality, and responsiveness so to save yourself a headache later best to work that out now.  In some things I've seen posted here it is very expected to have a large difference in response size from each participant, so check in and see!  I'm sure some Dom(me)s would be tickled pink to slowly but surely take away your options and have that reflected both in the RP and in the size of your responses.  And I'm sure others would love to watch your repeated struggles against those limits, complete with full length responses detailing that.  All depends on the person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise for general advice (works in and out of bondage too)\n\n* Explore all your senses\n   * Ex. If you're blindfolded and can't see, what do you hear, smell, feel, etc.\n      * There are far more than five, but things like magnetoception likely won't ever come up...\n   * This includes things which got messed up... if you were drugged, that sense of balance is probably all messed up, express that!\n   * Note for everyone that visiting other senses can help bring things alive, we're visual creatures so tend to focus there but give the others some love too. You learn a ton about a room based on how it smells when you enter\n* As others mentioned already, have an active inner monologue\n   * Even if you're so restricted you literally can't do or feel anything you can typically still think!\n   * Fair warning I've met a couple people who *really* didn't like putting thoughts into the RP; they felt it was a cheat for not just describing actions and letting those speak your inner thoughts for you\n      * Ex. Saying you are nervous vs. having a temporary stutter, glancing around a lot, having a light twitch, etc.\n      * I can see their point, but feel there is benefit to having a monologue going for clarity, just don't abuse it\n* Always provide RP hooks for your partner... both Dom(me) and Sub and people doing neither... always!\n   * Generally just think about what options you're leaving them in their responses; pretend you are going to respond to your own pose from their point of view and make sure to leave open things to respond to and however much agency is desired in the scene to progress the story; don't railroad things (unless that is the kink) but don't paint them into a corner with nothing to do either\n   * This can also be good to help steer the scene with suggestions if you're not doing that on the side\n      * Ex. Snidely twirled his mustache, taunting the captive Mountie; 'I wonder what you're thinking Do-Right, brainwashed as you are, unable to do anything but watch Nell's inevitable end as the locomotive draws near!'\n      * Dudley of course could internal monologue about how his body won't respond, the anguish of watching his love in peril, and slight twitches or spasms of his body being all he can muster in his attempts to save her. Don't fret though, Horse will come to her rescue\n* Don't be afraid to start an OOC side channel chat\n   * Even if you're unable to contribute as much as you'd like in the RP directly you can always contribute ideas on the side\n   * For that matter, sometimes people just like to hear you're enjoying and wish you could say more; getting back short responses can feel like the other person isn't interested or engaged. But a chat on the side can fix that worry and make sure you're giving them the type of responses they're looking; the best person to ask what they'd like is them after all!\n   * Also great for working out story direction far in the future, what is working/not working, etc.",
