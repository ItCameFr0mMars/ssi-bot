I mean, that's the respectful thing to do anyways\n\n\\[M4F\\] posts just have a harder time here unfortunately. That's why you'll usually see the same ones every week as they didn't get any bites, the same with some \\[F4M\\] ads... though it's a different case for them, lots of responders but mostly half-assed messages and spam like 'hey, wanna fuck? :)'\n\nWhat I do is give each ad a month, if it doesn't get any bites scrap it or remake it. Then try again, if at least one person responds then I keep it around longer. The only part I 'save' are my plots as I worked too hard on some to just permanently delete forever.\n\nAs for replies to messages you send? I'm afraid I can't help you, I rarely send out replies anymore unless the ad really attracts my attention. It's just unmotivating typing out a paragraph or two response only to receive nothing, I mean a 'No thanks' would be appreciated, when I say *nothing* I'm referring to the silence. :P",

Now, dont get me wrong, I make mistakes here and there too, but at some point its just one too many.\n\nNow, things I look out for:\n\n* Thought out replies, that arent (or dont look like) pasted messages.\n* Replies that include the Kinks and Limits, as well as expectations/wishes for the RP\n* A basic description of who my partner will be in RP. Looks, personality, occupation if it applies and so on. Doesnt need to be more than 3 sentences, just the basics.\n* If I have a set prompt of mine, a reply to it is awesome too, it shows me how someone plays and writes and also shows interest.\n\nMost important to me is mutual respect out of RP. Life can get in the way, sometimes the spark goes out, or something that happens in RP doesnt sit well with you. If I have a partner who I know I can tell this and he wont push me, wont be upset then thats already better than 95% of the people Ive played with.",

This is a non-issue when we actually get to know each other, but for first impressions, no, thank you.\n*People who clearly do not care about what I actually posted. This goes anywhere from messaging me with copypaste messages (this is oddly common; I sometimes see the messages in prompts that they've posted before, and once I got the same message that I had already gotten on a different account, where I post my \"lazy\" prompts) This also includes people who go like \"I saw you wanted this, but also can do this thing you listed as your limit?\"\n*Messages like \"Hey sweety, I would love to fuck you\". I'm on here to write sexy stories, not to sext. I very rarely go into rp'ing with this idea of \"Fuck yeah, I wanna get off to this\" but on the rare ocassion that I *do*, it's usually really out-there, unrealistic fantasies, in which case the basic dirty talk stuff also doesn't do anything for me.\n*Empty accounts/obvious throwaways are not worth any time. They'll be gone in a day or two.\n*People who have the same prompt like 44 times on their profile. There's a sense of desperation and only wanting to do that one thing in that.\n*Lastly, tone. Even a message and a poster that avoids all of these can have an unpleasant tone. A lot of time this is the overly-intellectual crowd, the overly-selfdeprecating crowd, and those kinda things. I just prefer to write with someone who feels like a well-adjusted, normal adult.",
