I've lost count on the number of different shots and angles I've seen, it's rather neat. But to the point, these \"boys\", wouldn't read, they would skim, see a target and drop onto it.\n\nWhat they didn't realize, or maybe didn't care, but we have real feelings, we love and we like dealing with people. But, we like dealing with people who can read, pay attention to what we stated we were in the first place. As funny as it can be to \"surprise them\" with my own equipment, it's infuriating how many of them are just, _dumb, dumb dumb, dumb dumb dumb thirsty boys._\n\nLike I said, I think it's unfair to say it's men, it's pretty obviously perpetual adolescents who never had to grow up and so have not.\n\nI'm really sorry you've been dealing with it so much, it's really not fun and I can understand completely.

            "body": "So, I'm a guy and fairly new here. I can understand that immediately asking for pics and especially receiving unsolicited dick pics is always annoying.\n\nThat being said, I am here to look for pen pals. Most of this is RP and I don't mind, I do have fun with it. But often I find myself more looking for an actual pen pal to exchange life stuff and fantasies with. And if you click with someone then yes, it would be nice to have a photo. Because to me DPP is more along the lines of \"internet romance / erotic chat\". So while reference pics during RP are nice, I'm still in it for you personally, because you are my pen pal, not the fictional person you play or post pics of. If I want to see pics of random naked women, I can look at porn sites. But the whole reason why having a pic of my pen pal is far more exciting is because it is a person I feel a connection and attraction to, and if you do not, you have picked the wrong pen pal.\n\nObviously the problem is that some people can't stick to the \"internet\" part of romance, so I understand that especially the women are hesitant to reveal anything that has to do with their real lifes. There are plenty of stories of guys out there who try to take this into real life against their pen pals wishes and we all know in this day and age that strangers on the internet can get very scary. So I understand if you just don't feel like sharing your actual self or pictures of yourself with anyone, because you never know what will happen.\n\nThe other reason why I do like to have a pic of my pen pal is that even during RP, when I post an M4F, there have been plenty of guys trying to disguise as F without disclosing it. So I do try to at least eventually, when some trust has been built, request my partners to send me a pic so I know they are actually female if their post history is short or somewhat sketchy, simply because I don't feel comfortable engaging in erotic content with another guy. Because I would like to stay safe as well and be at ease when talking to my partners. But obviously, me asking for a pic always makes it seem as if that's all I'm in for, when all I am actually trying to do is shut up that voice in my head that tells me: \"You don't know who that is, this could be a guy fantasizing about raping you right now\". That's not a nice situation to be in, to be honest.\n\nSo yeah, just my thoughts about this topic. Of course these are very different situations to yours, but I find that situations like yours and that of many other women here often lead to women adopting a no-tolerance-policy when it comes to sending pictures of themselves and I find that really disappointing. Understandable, but still disappointing.",

Did you even read my post? I said \u201cif you don\u2019t want pictures, say so in prompts and messages.\u201d  Being asked for pictures is not a big deal. Say no, and move on. Simple, right? \n\n&gt; Now you're telling these people to leave a sub\n\nNo, OPs post said \u201cgo to another sub.\u201d  I was mirroring her words. She can demand people leave this sub if they want to ask pictures, I\u2019m using her own logic here. \n\n&gt;Wikipedia link\n\nYou\u2019re being smug, not reasonable.",
