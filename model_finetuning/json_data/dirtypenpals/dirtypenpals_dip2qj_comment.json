You turn and run to the break room for a refill as you enter my office again you notice that your desk is now in the corner and instead of a chair there is an ottoman for you to sit on. I am on the phone so you wait as you hand me the coffee. I take it and motion you to go sit down \"I'll be with you in a moment\" I say to you.   I finish my conversation on the phone and as I hang up I wave you to come over to my desk.  \n\n\"What was your deal at the party this weekend?\" I demand.   \"You will be working in my office for as long as I see fit do you understand miss....\" \n\nIf you would like to continue pm me",
