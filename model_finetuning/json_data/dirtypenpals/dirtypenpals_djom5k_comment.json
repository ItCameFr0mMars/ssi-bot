I'm not totally sure why that is?\n\nAlso, my prompts have slowly but steadily gotten *longer* over time, which I don't think is a good thing.

            "body": "The actual content of my prompts hasn't changed all that much; I'm still looking for partners who are interested in both intimacy and rule 34 stuff.  But I'd say that the style and way I've presented my ideas has changed.  This isn't really reflected with the prompts on my profile since I haven't posted my prompts in the order I've thought of them (and many of the earliest prompts I thought up I still haven't posted).\n\nMy early prompts are all fairly vague and open ended.  When sitting writing them I pretty much decided on a character I wanted to write, and then in the prompt introduced my character's backstory and explained her general relationship with the character I wanted my partner to play.  And while that works fine, it left the details of the *actual scene* I wanted to play very vague.  Sure people learned a lot about the character I'd be playing and the general setting for a scene, but there wasn't really a plot or hook with which to jump into an actual roleplay.  Pretty much all my prompts could be boiled down to this:\n\n&gt;\"I'll be playing &lt;insert character here&gt; and she'll be your girlfriend and we can do a super wholesome and cute scene with lots of love, fluff, and affection!\n\nSo now I try to avoid doing that!  I try to come up with a specific plot or scene and then write a prompt around *that* instead of a character.  So instead of saying \"I want to write a scene involving Camilla from Fire Emblem\" I come up with an idea that I think she'd work well with and then write up that instead.  I feel that gives my prompts a lot more direction and focus, which translates into better roleplays as well because both my partner and I know where we want to take the scene.",

            "body": "So, riding off my good mood: DPP, tell me about some of the little things people do in their messages that make you feel good about your partner, or make you glad you\u2019re RPing with them? Not just essential stuff like \u201cactually writing more than one sentence\u201d and \u201cmessaged with what I asked for in the post,\u201d but the little things you wouldn\u2019t necessarily *ask* for, that are such a cherry on top of this whole experience.\n\nFor me, every now and then a partner will write an out-of-character note complimenting one thing I did in my last message (e.g. \u2018I loved the way you let me see how her facial expressions changed as she processed the news,\u2019 or \u2018kudos, that last description of [character] touching herself was super hot\u2019). Those always make my day, and they let me make a mental note of what kinds of writing I should do more of in the future.\n\nAnother thing I love is when they identify a potential problem, and come to me with a message pinpointing the problem *and* a couple of potential fixes that they\u2019ve come up with. (E.g. \u2018Considering our characters\u2019 personalities, they\u2019re never going to get past their own pride and actually fuck each other without help. So I thought, what if her X breaks and he\u2019s the only one around with Y tool to fix it? That would force them to melt the ice a little. Another option would be if Z entered the scenario, forcing them to make a temporary alliance to bring Z down. Let me know what you think.\u2019) These kinds of messages make me feel like we\u2019re working on this story *together,* which is delightful. If they just message me identifying a problem, sometimes I feel like they\u2019re expecting me to write the story for them; when they come with ideas, I feel like we\u2019re collaborating, and we can both pitch in our thoughts.\n\nBasically, any indication of a positive attitude from my partner lifts my whole mood, no matter what\u2019s going on in our RP.",

Sometimes I leave them intentionally because I want to see something happen but don't want to outright ask for it or I'm curious of their unique take on it, but sometimes I don't even realize I did it. When they show that they're *listening* and not just writing purely from their side of the table looking into a mirror. \n\nMost of my long-term roleplaying becomes very cerebral and character focused. Knowing the thoughts and motivations of the people that are colliding in bed is just as enticing as the mechanical conjoining for me. So it's an enjoyable shock any time a partner shares their character's internal monologue and gives me something I didn't expect that I can work off in my response. There's also the idea that how the character views the situation is just filtered from my partner's perspective, so it's a fun insight into their thought process and lets me write more to what they wish for.\n\nI'll emphatically second the identifying problems thing. Having a clear OOC channel that runs alongside the roleplay where they feel confident to voice those concerns and work together to keep everything running smoothly just makes things so much easier. The mutual approach to solving them also helps me feel more involved with the story and like its a collaborative effort we're both in on, not just sitting off in our opposite corners.",

As you said, collaboration is important. When somebody tells me that they really would prefer M/M or F/F or group sex or vanilla pairings, it helps me to plan out the tale a bit better. If reference photos are important, it's helpful to know that up-front. \n\nGenerally, I find it just comes down to communication - have you shown that you are willing/able to communicate in- and out-of-character? If yes, I'm generally going to be excited to write with you.",
