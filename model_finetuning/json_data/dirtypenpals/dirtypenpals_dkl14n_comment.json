Like, what are things to think about? I feel like I don't know what to focus on and make places sounds super vague. \n\nAlso when it comes to writing itself, I feel like I am reusing a lots of words. Is there away to avoid these kind of things?\n\nThe last thing is about pushing the story. I feel like I am scared of pushing the story forward and explain the details in certain areas because I usually play as the submissive and I kinda do not want to ruin the other persons plans. So, I am kinda asking guidelines when to push and when not too?",

Take a glass of pumpkin punch, take a cookie, take a seat!\n\nI thought I'd start us off by asking about inspiration. Those who write r34 prompts obviously take world-building inspiration from the source material, but those of us who craft our own worlds, or set our stories in a recognizable geographic area or time period of the real world, still tend to get ideas from somewhere.\n\nSo tell us. Movies? TV shows? Obscure children's books that no-one else seems to have read? ...Modern Ballet? (Guilty. Of all four.) Does your inspiration tend to come more in the form of borrowing atmosphere, topography, scenario, or culture?

            "body": "Hi Alice! Glad you're here.\n\nFor something like world-building, you'll probably get a lot of advice as the week goes on and more people trickle in to add their two cents. I'd recommend putting effort into your characters' five senses, by which I mean: spend time over the course of the roleplay exploring what the see, hear, feel, taste, touch in the world you're building. If they're walking home to their apartment, for example, you can write about how the road is cracked and littered with potholes after a particularly harsh winter, or how the air feels heavy with the humidity, causing their hair to frizz and grow lank, or how they can smell the sweet and tangy aroma of the barbecue their sexy neighbor is cooking up on his balcony.\n\nAs for making your writing 'better' and using more words, I'd say be cautious about getting out the thesaurus, but try to *describe* things rather than (or in addition to) just naming them. It doesn't have to be just a shirt, it can be \"that annoying fabric between your hands and my skin.\"\n\nI'd also recommend playing with sentence structure, so that the focus isn't just on the words you use but on the way they're used. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/55ncw4/image_the_art_of_sentence_length/) is an illustration of what I mean.\n\nBest of luck, and thanks for coming 'round!",

Here's a passage from my profile that touches on this.\n\n&gt;It's frankly magic to me when a storyteller expresses their craft by putting it to a musical background with rhythm and flow. Makes you listen for the next part, build up anticipation, and let the beat drive you forward without hesitation. It's these aspects I hope to have reflected in my writing in some small way ... It's fun to pick out just a couplet or short passage out of a song and let it unfurl into something worth exploring with a prompt\n\nIt helps that my music tastes run towards the lyrically dense and often have pretty women saying pretty things about love and sex. On the other side of things John Darnielle of 'The Mountain Goats' is a *fantastic* song-writer that has given me the genesis for such concepts for prompts including : Eve sneaking back into the garden of Eden to find an orgy going on, a couple on the verge of their relationship imploding finding solace in a fireworks show and a shower floor, a recently graduated Catholic schoolgirl seeing Satan in a man she is being seduced by, and a late-night cheating tryst scored by AM radio jazz and set in a nebulous college apartment that neither person belongs in.",

I\u2019ve broken down general topics I\u2019d like to discuss into several threads below so to keep everything organized. I\u2019m hoping to elaborate on one topic a day so that there\u2019s a continuous stream of information and an incentive for any people on DPP to check in throughout the week. Feel free to add to the discussion if you so wish. If you have general questions you\u2019d like to ask or wish to begin a new topic, start a new thread so everything remains well organized for people that just want to browse.\n\nBefore I begin, I want to say that writing and it\u2019s \u2018effectiveness\u2019 is really quite subjective and many people find success using various methods. What I\u2019m going to say is simply my belief what good roleplaying/writing should be which has been very effective for me, but I will admit that my style is suited for long-term stories and much less for short-term collaborations or chats. I\u2019m hoping that my tips are helpful for stories of all kinks, ranging from Vanilla to BDSM to Sci-Fi/Fantasy to even those including otherworldly beings.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s a list of topics that I plan to cover, if you want me to give my thoughts on something else that isn\u2019t here, feel free to mention it in a comment. I\u2019ll likely add more to this list as the days go on.\n\n1)\tWorldbuilding and Setting\n\n2)\tRoleplay Etiquette\n\n3)\tCharacterization\n\n4)\tPlotting Out\n\nAnyway, enjoy your time here and hopefully you\u2019ll leave this little pocket of the universe as a bit better of a writer!",

            "body": "I'd like to take this opportunity to get some pointed feedback/suggestions on a sort of 'white whale' idea that I've been kicking around off and on for awhile. Although r/dpp_workshop has a lovely community, I thought I'd take advantage of the broader audience here in specifically helping frame a compelling world.\n\nAt the crux of it this is a coming of age (but legal) lesbian love story. I have a *thing* for love that wins out against all odds, that bumps up against hurdles and still manages to clamber hand in hand over them, even if it scuffs its knees along the way. So I wanted to set this story in an environment that would lead to conflict and essential secrecy.\n\nMy first thought was to place the coordinates in the deep South (US), possibly a semi or full on rural surroundings to emphasize the 'we're alone in this' factor a burgeoningly gay couple would experience. This also allows me to play with religious mores of repression giving way to eventual acceptance of self and sex-positivity which are pet themes of mine, slapping it down in the bible belt. This does make the cast of ancillary characters possibly limited, depending on how 'small-town' I go with it, so unsure still. Thoughts?\n\nThe real question I find myself wavering on is what era to set it in. While I have no doubt I could write convincing conflict and non-acceptance of same-sex romance even setting it in the modern day, I kind of wanted to double down on making it taboo and a fight worth having. Perhaps Reagan's America, in the 80s, gay panic abound? Without being able to easily find a community of similar lesbians online the two women would be more pushed to bond with each other and figure things out on their own. My initial scribblings of this included a bunch of references to feminist punk from the 80s melding into the 90s like Bikini Kill and Joan Jett, but that was mainly for flavor. \n\nAny feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!",

Sure it's plenty of fun to drop a quick set-up and get into the melding of flesh, but the worlds are where the true pleasure of DPP come in.\n\nFor my longest RPs I find myself doing research, prep-work, whether it's how a tattoo artist properly brands a new sub for a master or how best a magician wows an audience with sleight of hand.  It might be using real life neighborhoods in Chicago, or merely drafting entire sections of upcoming storylines you know how you see coming to fruition.\n\n\nThere's one such story that I was writing with a gifted partner that had an abrupt end.  My notes, my dreams about the story's eventual finale.  I can't help but feel like that entire corner of fantasy is like seeing an ex with another guy when I see new prompts about it.   Shuts down my writing muse, sometimes.\n\nThe question that I bring you today involves writing in such worlds, with details strewn in every post, intricate plot lines melding together.  I hesitate to even call it 'long term' as these are the stories that can span into the hundreds of thousands of words and dozens of named characters.  What I want to hear you speak on is how you keep writing in excruciating detail when one of those ends without a satisfactory conclusion.",

I don\u2019t ever use character reference pictures (out of personal taste\u2014more power to those who enjoy using reference pictures!) because a) I usually make a character in my mind first, and then have a devil of a time finding an image that describes that, and b) I like to imagine my partner\u2019s character as they\u2019ve described them, using what *I* interpret \u201clong, wavy hair\u201d or \u201colive skin marred by old battle scars\u201d to visually mean. Once I get a photo, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no mental fiddling with it, no imagining the person as I find the sum of their parts to coalesce in the most attractive way\u2014they\u2019re just the static image to me. I worry that the same thing would happen with a song; that a partner would be interpreting the tone of the piece in the best way for them, and if I linked a song that I felt described the tone but that wasn\u2019t to their musical taste, it would sour the whole tone of the roleplay for them.",
