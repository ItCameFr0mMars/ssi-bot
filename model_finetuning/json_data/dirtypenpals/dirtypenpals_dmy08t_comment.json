No phone numbers, email addresses, actual addresses, identities, kik usernames, or other private information of yours or of someone else.\" It is the last sentence of that rule, after the above quoted part, which baffles me a bit: \"This includes Reddit usernames, even if it\u2019s meant to compliment or give credit to another user.\"\n\n(this was not always an explicit part of this rule, and was added more recently than the first part)\n\nReddit usernames aren't exactly private information if you're not attaching any other of the items above to it. Also, people regularly do link to other usernames, such as in \"Share\" posts and some others as well. They are also often mentioned in comments, doing exactly the kind of thing the rule says not to do such as complimenting or giving credit. This is great, and in fact quite possibly necessary if we want this to be a community instead of just having each post be its own entirely isolated thing. If we aren't going to enforce this rule at those times, and we don't have clarity of when exactly it will be enforced, perhaps it should be removed?",

The writing is so good, and it's written in a way that makes it a real page turner. As someone who likes to do long-form and world building prompts, *Dune* does a really good job with so little words describing just how the situation is on Arrakis and the world as a whole, and implementing all the ideas that are present in it without being overbearing. \n\nAnother example is the TV show *Succession*. The way it's written is really incredible, and it's really fast-paced. There's combinations of words that I've never really think to hear, and it's really unique in just how well the writing goes from dark comedy to Shakespearian tragedy. \n\nIt's not recent, but a shoutout to *Red Dead Redemption II* as well, since I still find myself thinking about it almost a year later, and just how hard the writing hit me, especially towards the end. \n\nLong story short, I was just wondering if any of you guys had anything like that, where you consumed some form of media and it made you just want to sit down and write something because of how impressed you were by it.",

As for your questions....\n\n&gt;Do the gender tags match the genders of the writers, or the genders of the story characters?\n\nThat varies from post to post.  Sometimes the gender tags apply to the writers themselves and other times it applies to the characters. \n It can be kind of a guessing game to figure out which one someone means since they don't always specify.  Normally though I assume that if someone is looking to chat or swap stories or whatever then the gender tags apply to the writers since there aren't any characters involved.  For roleplays it can be a bit harder though.  Sometimes you'll see a post with something like [M4A as F] which makes it clear that the poster doesn't care about the gender of their partner as long as they *write* a female character.  Other times people will include in the actual body of their prompt a disclaimer stating that they either *only* want replies from people of a certain gender or don't care as long as you write the gender they're looking for.\n\nSo, tl;dr there isn't a hard and fast rule that *everyone* abides by.\n\n&gt;Would dirty/erotic poetry be appropriate in this sub, or is it strictly for more traditional stories?\n\nNot a mod so my word isn't 100% gospel, but I don't see why not?  That's assuming you're posting to look for a partner with whom to exchange poetry though.  I don't think a post that just shows off your own writing would be appropriate.",

The rule as written is intended to prevent unwanted attention to users, especially the large portion of the userbase that doesn't interact with the subreddit itself, but only replies to prompts. Not everybody who uses the sub does so through a dedicated/NSFW alt, and we want to respect users privacy.\n\nAs you've pointed out, the execution of the rule in practice doesn't match up well to the current letter of the rule. Shares, for example, have always had the option of including the partner's username, and generally we don't remove comments that mention a user that's participating elsewhere in a thread (as long as the comment doesn't violate the Be Respectful rule).\n\nWe're discussing how to better make the written rule line up with the unwritten execution, but with a mod team scattered around the globe, these things take time.",
