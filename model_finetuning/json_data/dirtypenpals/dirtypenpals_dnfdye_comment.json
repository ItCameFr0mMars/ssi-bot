I asked my boss what to do, and she suggested that you could help me. So I hope you can help. \n\nOr, maybe I do have questions. I've never been hypnotized before but I want to trust you when you do it.\n\nCan you tell me what will happen after I am hypnotized?\n\nWill I remember it?\n\nIs there anything I should do now to prepare for it, before we start?\n\nThanks, doctor. I appreciate your help and I'm ready to start our session.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nThis should be FUN! I have the same kinks as you. My kinks are submission, mental control, gentle humiliation, cock slapping, training, forced exhibitionism, orgasm control, forced masturbation, forced orgasms, hypnosis, seduction, hypnotic domination, pegging, hypnotic enslavement... and probably a half dozen more.",

And second, yes, I have a couple of questions.\n\nWhilst I'm aware of how hypnosis works I'd like to know what would happen when I'm hypnotized?\n\nWhat techniques would you use to remove the mental blocks that stop me from resting?\n\nI have trouble relaxing, so how would you help me relax in order to hypnotize me?\n\nI must say it sounds like you're the best doctor (and prettiest, your eyes look beautiful!) for the job, I hope you can work your magic on me!\n\nFinal question - when can we start the therapy?\n\n----------------\nThis us a great prompt! We have similar links (apart from pegging) and I'm sure there's a lot we could do with this if you're still looking for people!",
