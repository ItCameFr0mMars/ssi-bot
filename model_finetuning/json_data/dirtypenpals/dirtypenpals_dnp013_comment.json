Fact of the matter is that there's lots of different factors behind what makes a partner eligible for a good long-term roleplay. \n\nThey need to have a similar writing style and length to you (I personally find a roleplay unplayable if my character gets controlled by the other person or if there's absolutely no punctuation and poor grammar), they need to have genuine enthusiasm for the role, you both need to be happy to chat out of character about the roleplay (no roleplay is perfect, being able to fix things is crucial for longevity) and both of you need to get lucky that work, chores and other things don't get in the way of replies. \n\nEveryone has their own requirements but unless you honestly don't care what your partner writes like, I feel like a week is already a pretty decent length of time.",

I gotta write a bit, let it sit, go back and refine it, then write a bit more, etc. I need quite a bit of time between replies so I feel my partner is getting a message that's worthy of their time. Some days I'm just not in the mood to write. I try and let my partners know I'll be taking a day+ between messages, and hopefully they're okay with it.\n\nHasn't been an issue for me yet, though I suppose I've been luckier than most.",

I like to reply with several paragraphs and have kept a couple stories running for years or longer, but very few of my stories keep for months regardless of the speed of buildup.\n\nI lose a few to missed replies on their end and the fact that Reddit enjoys stuffing some responses in the messages tab and never tells me about them, but far more frequently it's simply because the expectations we had were different. So, even someone dealing with female partners (like myself) doesn't have a high rate of pushing beyond a couple of days.\n\nCasting a wider net in terms of story beats, looking outside of your peak hours or different parts of the week, and continuing to look even if you have an active partner are pretty decent stratagems for finding something that will go a very long time.",

            "body": "Short term answer - I made a similar mistake when I first started reaching out to people. Nowadays I consider short term to mean 'This goes until one of us gets off and then we call it finished' and long term to mean 'There may be more than one scene, maybe, who knows.'\n\nLong term answer - Short term, in my experience, generally means a single one-shot scene. Here's me, here's you, maybe there's a bit of backstory to explain why we're both here and about to throw down, then it's wham bam thank you mam and it's done. Session length is generally a single day and may run a few more depending on how well you hit it off with your partner. Response time is expected to be quick and snappy and responses are usually shorter with a focus locked purely on the sexual happenings.\n\nLong term, by contrast, is a more nebulous concept around here and varies greatly from person to person. While short term typically means 'I want to chat or get off right now or today at the absolute latest', long term is something you have to suss out with your partner. Session length can be a few days to several months to potentially longer, depending on how it ends up playing out, how much you and your partner hit it off and how much backstory/non-sex stuff you want to write for it. Response times are usually more forgiving and spread out, with days sometimes passing between replies. Responses themselves tend to be a mixture of sex and backstory or world building, with the longer term role plays (think multiple weeks to multiple months here) having a pretty lopsided ratio of plot to sex in favor of the plot. Multiple sex scenes are typically expected/asked for.\n\nI can't say which approach has a better success rate with any kind of objectivity, but I personally have found much more success by going after long term prompts. I believe there's a simple explanation for that - long term prompts tend to be posted by people who've put a lot of time and effort into building up their idea, and as such they'll be more willing to stick it out instead of losing interest after a day or three. While ghosting is always a factor, I've found that short term partners tend to ghost more, while long term partners tend to respond less to initial prompt responses but have a much higher chance of actually playing a scene out to completion if you manage to catch their interest. Anecdotally, I've also found that long term scenes are far more satisfying for me.",

No hard limit cap.  \n\n\nWhat really gets me is people who want \"short-term\" What is \"short-term\"? Is it a few months, a week? I don't know how people get anything done when they only look for people for just a day or evening.  \n\n\nIn my experience most posts I respond to are 30min-2h after the post went up because I can't be on reddit 24/7 refreshing the page every 5 minutes. Then it takes 5-12h to get a response, if at all. Then even if you answer back immediately it takes another 40min-2h to get that Ultra Rare second response proving you didn't just see a ghost.  \n\n\nThen after that, if things get rolling, we're doing a response every 10-20min. And that's with us both free at the same time responding immediately when we get a message. And if either of us, i dunno, works or has any sort of responsibility, you might have a 1-14h break in between that.  \n\n\nBy the time the person responds, the evening is already over, it's the next day. I can't make quality content without a little bit of thought and time, I also ~~have a life~~ **pretend to have a life**. But that's club lingo I suppose.",
