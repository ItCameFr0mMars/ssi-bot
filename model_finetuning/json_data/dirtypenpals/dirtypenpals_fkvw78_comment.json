Please indicate where I lumped all men together because I don't believe I have, in fact a lot of what I said was fairly gender neutral. \n\nIf you got a hundred or more PM's, would you respond to each one you rejected?

That's like saying you wouldn't mind getting slapped on the ass so you might as well go around slapping people on the ass. The Golden rule is treat people how you want to be treated,but above that you should treat people how they want to be treated.\n\nAnd no, blaming people for conditioning people to act a certain way makes no sense in this context. If I post everyday about a fantasy where I get shot in the head, does that justify someone shooting me in the head? Not only that, but you act as if all women and all men are these opposing monoliths and their averaged out experiences decide how they should be treated. You should treat people as individuals.",

            "body": "Aight I\u2019m gonna mainly address this last paragraph first, and then I\u2019ll get to the rest of it. I have absolutely no Ill will towards you irl, and I\u2019m certain you\u2019re a decent person to your friends and family.\n\nDon\u2019t take the trend of dub-con/non-con in this sub to mean that ladies and those who play female roles **Are fine with getting messages that explicitly do what they said not to do.** Period. I understand that guys have a hard time on here, believe me I do. I\u2019ve posted a couple M4F rps in the past because I legitimately wanted to play from the male perspective for a change, and didn\u2019t really get anywhere. That\u2019s ok, I\u2019m not entitled to a response, or even upvotes. \n\nBut the crux of the issue op raised is far more important than guys being ignored or ghosted. I understand I kind of repeated myself there, but it\u2019s important enough to mention twice. I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve put in my posts for my prospective partners to not send me a starter, please don\u2019t send me chats, don\u2019t try to flirt with me as I do not give the slightest fuck about that 99.99% of the time. You know what over 3/4 of my replies are despite those disclaimers? Exactly what I said \u201cHey don\u2019t do this\u201d about. \n\nI admit that there is some measure of responsibility that can be laid at the feet of those who have, willingly or unwillingly, cultivated the \u201cAlpha Chad who takes what he wants regardless of a No\u201d, but it seems to me that most guys on here cannot fucking read. When the op of a prompt you like says don\u2019t do something, **DO NOT DO IT. PERIOD.** Reading comprehension and some empathy for the other person goes a long, long way. I don\u2019t want to open up my inbox and see some guys cock, or an offer to be \u201chis little fuckslut.\u201d I hate that kind of thing myself, so you\u2019ll never see that from me. Yet do I get that kind of thing anyway? Yeah.\n\nIn closing, I understand the issues you raised. They are important and I really do feel for the guys on here who don\u2019t do any of the things I listed above. The bad ones give them an undeserved reputation and that sucks. I\u2019ve met some great people on this subreddit, one of whom I\u2019m happy to call my best friend. But it\u2019s very, very hard to try and make any kind of legitimate connection with people when your limits and do-nots are repeatedly ignored.",
