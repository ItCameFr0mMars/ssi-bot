I\u2019m excited to respond and interact with people. But even when I\u2019m done replying for the day I still find myself back on here looking at peoples posts under some idea that I\u2019ll find THE post.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what the post is but supposedly it will be fun and creative and make me happy. I think I might be giving in to my depression again. I did this a lot as a high schooler too. Seeking out the sexual attention of men online. I\u2019m getting attention at home. \n\nHell I sucked my husbands cock just last night before I went back to work for my second shift. I\u2019m not quite sure what I want out off DPP but it\u2019s a great way to pass time and keep writing. When I write for myself I get stuck constantly. I always think it\u2019s not good enough. Writing on here there\u2019s a pressure to not take to long when responding so I can\u2019t just delete everything I write.\n\nThough I don\u2019t abandon accounts this is my main reddit and I only have one alt that I use for filthy rp I won\u2019t admit to liking on this account..",

It's not that it was overly demoralizing, or rude, it was valid, probably correct advice, but at the end of the day I do wonder if that side of things, the prompt writing, just isn't in my wheelhouse.\n\nSide note, these metas lately have made me start to wonder if I get way too ramble-y with *everything* I write.

However, I think that if you present your prompts the best way *you* can, you will find the kind of partner that is right for you. If you over-tinker your prompt to the point where it doesn't resemble your usual writing, that will only lead to let-downs in your inbox. \n\nAlso, as a male poster, you will receive less responses no matter how good your prompt is. Sometimes, you will get *nothing*. Don't let that discourage you. Change it up a bit every time, and it will work eventually.\n\nLastly, don't concern yourself with copying ideas. No one can trademark ideas, especially not on DPP. If you want to play out something, write a prompt about it. It doesn't matter how many other people write a prompt about a similar topic. There are probably 100.000 Celebrity-GoT-girl prompts every day from all sorts of people. And yet, I can assure you that they will get responses. If more people post about the same thing, that means there is a market for it. \n\nCopy what others are doing, put your own spin to it - the writing matters more than the originality, at least when it comes to *finding* a partner. I don't care how good an idea is if the writing is shit - and vice versa, I will not turn down a partner because their beautifully presented prompt wasn't *creative* enough.",

But I often get particular stories in my head that I'd like to write out with people and am only drawn to particular stories. So I will add a disclaimer that I am open to other ideas, or link to my other prompts, rather than scrolling through page after page and trying to pan for gold in a sea of stuff that's not to my taste. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think another thing I'd add is that it's important to own your Very Specific Thing if you have that strong of a preference to a degree where it will affect your enjoyment of the scene. Mine is that I write only in traditional prose and ask that my partners do too, and I can't stomach quirks of language like the overuse of ellipses, writing out dialogue in italics, or writing with one sentence per line. For awhile I spent time trying to grin and bear it when people who don't write that way would message me, or I'd think \"I should be able to settle for this sort of writing structure, since they're into the weird plot and I may not find anyone else.\" Nah.  It makes me want to put a shotgun between my teeth when my partners decide that they don't need to use punctuation, for example, so now I tend to put the form of writing in my limits section just so we're all clear.",

Spending more time on the workshop is something I should consider myself - I *know* of it, but I never really used it. But it is definitely a good way to do some writing without overburdening yourself, or forcing any obligations onto you.\n\nAaaaand yeah, limits are the key. I am bad at that, still, but it has gotten better. Obviously, it is a different situation right now, since I got no shit to do anyway, but there is *always* something better to do than refreshing reddit - taking a 15/20-minute break in between refreshes, at least, could work well to do some other stuff in between without \"missing out\" - but the missing-out mindset itself can be rather unhealthy....

Six to eight hours are rookie numbers. You need to bring these numbers u... *fuck, no, wrong moment for jokes*.\n\nYeah, the whole interacting-with-people thing is obviously very prominent right now. Isolation brings lonelyness, and DPP is a good outlet there, but if it continues on into more fortunate times, that's when issues really start. \n\nAlso, chasing the dragon, as you describe it here as finding \"THE post\", is something I relate soooo much too. I created Male accounts just to create the prompts I would want to read as a woman, but that was obviously a shite idea too. Same about the online-attention thing. \n\n&gt; When I write for myself I get stuck constantly. I always think it\u2019s not good enough. Writing on here there\u2019s a pressure to not take to long when responding so I can\u2019t just delete everything I write.\n\nInteresting point. My actual \"career\" (college, so not a career yet) is all about writing alone. So for me, this is a place to share my hobby with others. But I could obviously aslo do that with other people in my real life. But DPP doesn't expect quality. I am not graded on what I write here - and that takes so much pressure off. \n\nSo... yeah, there are many reasons to spend time on DPP - everyone should just be aware of their own limits, and where the black hole lies for them, so that they can stop before they get there and reassess their usage. Unfortunately, we don't have a DPP-anonymous-group :D",

At the end I ripped him a new asshole not because he likes tying girls up and not having sex with them, but because he was pretending to be clueless about why I was angry, after painstakingly discussing things, wearing what he wanted, acting the way he wanted, and him listening to me list out what I wanted. I think it goes to the question of what's okay to \"assume\" when roleplaying, and in this case I think it was an unfair assumption for him to get on DPP and just assume that his partner, who has a full, robust list of sexual-themed kinks and limits, to be okay with indulging exactly zero of those. But that's just me venting now. It's been quite awhile since that happened and to date it's the most futile RP scene I've ever done.",
