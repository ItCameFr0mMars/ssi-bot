Even the \"I [21M]\" stuff is in there!\n\nWould have been even better with some kinks and limits and the direction you want it to go! Unless you just want a bunch of AITA-style comments?\n\nNTA: Your girlfriend needs to realise that you are just being yourself and trying to be as helpful as possible, especially as you are not paying board or anything.  I think it is a little selfish of her to want to keep you for herself, have all the fun, and not allow you to pay the mother and sister back for their generosity.\n\nIt might be an idea to try and involve her in these activities, that way she won't feel left out, which I guess she is right now.",

I wish I had someone in my life who would have kept me on track at that age, and if all her mom asks for in return for cooking and cleaning and putting you up is a little #fitspo that seems like a great deal in this economy.\n\nBut... is your GF still getting the same amount of time from you? She will be used to being the only woman in your life and in addition to moving home as an adult, theres going to be some adjustments to be made. It'll be tough with your new responsibilities but make sure you're still making time for her. Are you still helping her study by licking her out for each essay she gets an A on? Are you still balls deep in her ass while she revises for midterms? \n\nBeing a Daddy to so many women is a lot of work and the temptation to help all the women out of the goodness of your heart is real. But you're not superhuman. You may have to divvy up the load: have the aunt wear a dildo face gag and kneel behind the mom on the treadmill so that if she slows down, she'll have a firm reminder to speed up, or have your GF sit on her sister's face while you spank her. \n\nI believe in you and together I'm sure you'll make it work.",
