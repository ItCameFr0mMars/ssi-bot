People say it's bland, it's ordinary, but tell me, what is so ordinary about a tropical flower that has to be picked at JUST the right time to have the proper seeds to create such a wonderful flavor. \n\nAnd think about what vanilla adds to so many things! What would things, delicious, savory, be without something as simple as vanilla. \n\nAnd yet it's...boring. Bland. Me I love it, there's something exciting about the thrill of something as simple as a romantic connection between two strangers, coworkers, neighbors etc. \n\nMy stories tend to drift to the vanilla because you can add too much to it and it loses its flavor so to speak.

            "body": "&gt; What does Vanilla taste like? Wrong answers only.\n\nOne of the things I like most about vanilla is the ability to focus on fundamentals. If an ice cream shop doesn't do vanilla well, then chances are the other flavors won't be great, either. Pottery apprentices in Japan need to make 10,000 simple teacups before they are allowed to deviate and start making their own creations. But vanilla doesn't have to mean boring by any stretch - there are ample opportunities to focus and bring out the extraordinary within the ordinary.\n\nSoft caresses. Intimate touches. Incorporating scents and sounds and tastes into roleplay. A light moan here. Some intense eye contact there. Maybe even some hand holding, if you want to go really nuts. That's what I think Vanilla tastes like.\n\nJust kidding. The actual wrong answer is [beaver butts](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/castoreum/).",

An attorney with ideas for novels that will never actually get written so I put my free time and effort into crafting smutty slice of life role plays that include dialogue that makes me giggle.\n2. People think being an attorney is like being on Law and Order. And it totally is. The plots to the crimes and claims in real life are just as weird and stupid. The main difference is no one ever cracks under pressure in trial. Mostly they just say \"I don't know\" and \"I don't recall.\" So, basically my life is almost exactly like Law and Order, if Law and Order involved insurance fraud.\n3. \"I have chicken tenders.\" Name a more romantic sentence in the English language. I'll wait.\n4. Sprinkles. People always forget about those colorful little sugary bastards when they talk about vanilla. The best part of vanilla is always the sprinkles.",
