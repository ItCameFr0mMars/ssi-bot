            "body": "Two hours ago, your flatmate had all but dragged you from your bed. It is now seven in the morning and there is a mermaid. . .in your bathtub. She had only recently calmed from the fit she\u2019d been pitching from the moment she\u2019d regained consciousness, and neither of you really had a plan as to what you were going to do with her, next. Not that it mattered in your regard, really. You weren\u2019t the one that\u2019d dragged her from the beach to a bathtub. She wasn\u2019t your responsibility. She was, however, of great interest to you. Because you *definitely* recognized her. She seemed not to recognize you, however; in the grand scheme of things, you weren\u2019t yet sure if this was to your benefit or detriment as the only other occupant of your shared apartment breathed down your neck.\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYou were contorted awkwardly along the floor of the hallway, face sandwiched against the bathroom door as you squinted through the crack and basked in the inherent creepiness of what you were doing. All the while, your flatmate whinged, earning only a sneer from you as you gave up the search and righted yourself. There were about a hundred replies you could issue in response to his, \u201cDude, *come on,\u201d* but a persistent silence seemed like your best friend, this morning. Mostly because your roommate probably wouldn\u2019t believe you if you said you recognized her, anyway; though, also, because you didn\u2019t really want to divulge the how and the why. So you simply sat there, stunned into quiet observation until his pestering peaked and you waved him off irritably. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably calmed down by now, Cass. I wouldn\u2019t be stoked about waking up in there, either.\u201d\n\nAs if to *confidently* illustrate your point, you reached for the doorknob. With a twist, the door creaks open, and you get your head about two-thirds of the way through when you catch the blur of an airborne 16-ounce shampoo bottle. An undignified cuss breached your lips as you pull backward, the door slamming with the momentum of one object thrown, only to shudder as it endured a further assault of nearly every other item in your shower. Okay, so she hadn\u2019t calmed down. Cass seemed about as impressed as the mermaid with your assumption as you pull away from the now firmly shut door. That is to say: not at all. It wasn\u2019t as though you were the one that had hauled the damn thing inside \u2014 something you pointedly remind him with a scowl. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t know! It\u2019s not *my* fucking *mermaid.* Maybe it\u2019s hungry?\u201d\n\nCass would blink, as if this is the first time that he\u2019d considered anything outside of the mermaid being a bloodthirsty bitch as culprit of her flared temper, before stiffly pulling himself up from the floor where the pair of you had been sat for the better part of the morning, now. \u201cI\u2019m...gonna head to the store.\u201d *Fucking finally.* You swallowed back a sigh of relief, only offering a lazy nod in response. His keys would jingle, a moment later, before the door opens, closes, and you\u2019ve pressed your ear to that of the bathroom, again. \n\n\u201cGet some dish soap, too. . .Dawn?\u201d\nYou call out upon his departure, vaguely recalling the commercials. If it worked for baby ducks, the now captive mermaid would probably fair well with a good scrub, too. You weren\u2019t a biologist and this wasn\u2019t exactly something you could google, so a guess would have to do. And, God, you\u2019d wager half of her outburst on the fact that she was covered in oil, from the tip of her tail to her slicked hair, for what was probably all of eight hours, now. The bathroom floor, too, had become splotched in inky liquid. A rainbow sheen covered every tile, creeping ever closer to the carpeted hallway as the mermaid\u2019s massive tail fins flecked and dripped the water with which Cass had overflowed the tub. You\u2019d presume that last night\u2019s oil spill would have the stores packed even so early in the morning. So that gave you some time. Alone. With the oil-saturated and fuming mer-person stuck in your bathroom. You groaned at the thought, idling restlessly in the hallway just long enough for the swishing of the water to subside. There was no easy way of gently reminding your mermaid friend that you meant no harm \u2014 and that you\u2019d met before \u2014 but cowering in the hallway wasn\u2019t helping.\n\nSo you finally stood, swallowing down a sharp breath before you pushed the door open, again. Her upper half was submerged, fluke skirting the tile floor with the occasional cat-like *thwip*. She was still\u2026definitely irritated, but was at least no longer perched on the edge of the tub to hiss at you and pitch foreign objects. So that\u2019s an improvement, at least. One you justified your next few steps with. You slinked closer to the tub, watching her simply lay there, face down in the shadow of the curtains. You pull them back. Slow and quiet; the sunlight seeped from the window and across the surface of the water to reveal a second layer of colorful residue in the tub. She sulked just beneath it, giving you a decent eye-full of the mermaid you\u2019d only met once before a few months back. Her huddled form was small and distorted, but wholly familiar to you. Her skin, ashy but light, was specked in dark freckles which grew in size and frequency the further your gaze traveled down her body. There was no clear distinction between her upper and lower halves, a dark gray gradient seeming to eat up her torso. Her tail resembled that of a spotted shark or seal in color, iridescent turquoise sparkling along any part of it which touched the sunlight. You were tempted almost to touch it, but refrained in favor of watching her, instead. You had no desire to anger her any further. Not that it ended up mattering, for you leaned in too close, and suddenly she seized the moment alongside frantic fistfuls of your shirt. The mermaid had launched herself blindly from the tub, water spilling out over the edge of it as the two of you topple unceremoniously to the ground. The splashing and sore thud are enough to alert the neighbors, but she seemed intent on drawing the attention of everyone within a five mile radius as she begins to spit and snarl at you. Her assault hadn\u2019t ceased for even a moment as you found yourself re-oriented now on the soaked tile floor, hands pushing up against her soft chest and arms. She was snapping sharp teeth at you while you attempted to drag yourself from beneath her on an elbow. \u201cIt\u2019s me \u2014 It\u2019s me!\u201d You shout numbly to no avail, her memory either not tracking or entirely uncaring of your identity. You aren\u2019t entirely convinced you can calm her down, anymore, and only want the upper ground, again. So you shove her backward, struggling for purchase against either the creature\u2019s slippery skin or the bathroom floor. Until, eventually, you fall backward with the sudden absence of the mermaid\u2019s weight. Not because you\u2019ve escaped her grasp, but because the only thing she\u2019d dug her nails into had resigned to her grasp. That being the hem of your *pants* \u2014 something you realize only as they catch the mermaid on the chin. Her head craned upward and she flailed, finally taking pause only long enough to reassess the mess she\u2019s gotten herself into.\n\nIt is here that her gaze finally flicked up and down your face, pale olive eyes scraping along your body before settling between your legs. You\u2019re exposed to her, and probably feeling uneasy. Because your last encounter with the mermaid had been far kinder, but she\u2019d seemed to slow in her attack, now. And even goes so far as to touch her tongue against her lips before she huffs at you through her nose. She\u2019d calmed down. Or at least averted her attention, for the moment. That was a good thing, right? You\u2019re not sure if you feel that way, yet, but let out a sigh of relief, anyway. At the very least, her teeth and fingers are no longer trying to burrow into your flesh, though you flinched as a cold and slick palm rose up to push your shirt along your torso. The air was cool against your bare thighs and stomach, a shudder crawling along your spine once the mermaid finally caressed your warm skin. So she\u2019d recognize you, tits mashing together as she hauled herself upward and forced her way between your legs. You\u2019d met only once before, the details sparse and fleeting, but extremely similar to what you were now enduring. And you\u2019re pretty sure that you\u2019re about to fuck a mermaid on your bathroom floor.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy apologies for the drawling starter, I am a little rusty after going on a writing hiatus but I\u2019ll catch up quickly &amp;&amp; I am always happy to write something else if we agree on a different setting or cast of characters. Her description is fairly vague on purpose, if you have a specific preference in what the mermaid looks like please let me know! Otherwise I will be more specific with my own description in my next response. As far as dynamics go, I can play submissive or dominant roles; the role-play can be light in tone or devolve into something darker. I don\u2019t really have any limits so far as the story is concerned ( aside those above ) and you can consider your kinks to be mine! I don\u2019t have a whole lot of experience with ERP but I like to think that makes me more of a sponge than anything else. I\u2019m happy to absorb whatever gets you off. :\u2019) Thank you for reading this, I hope to hear from you if this has piqued your interest!",
