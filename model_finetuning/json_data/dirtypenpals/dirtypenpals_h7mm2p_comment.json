            "body": "The Quest for Bukakke\nTales from the Pandemic\n\nHer: 24 [F] Asian, Nerdy, Slutty, Bored \n\nMe: 53 [M] White, a bigger nerd, sooo slutty, not bored but I have a bit of time to kill so let me tell you a tell you a story. \n\nWhich, may turn into a long story because during the COVID19 pandemic I didn\u2019t leave my house. I saw one person a handful of times. \n\nWhy isolate so completely you may ask? I did an inventory of the food and supplies and don\u2019t need much. In that moment the confidence I had drained out of me and was replaced by a shivering coldness. When the COVID19 virus comes to attack us, it could  become the most greedy bastards to ever come for us, what if the internet goes out and we  as in you, me, society can\u2019t watch any porn for years, until a vaccine is made. MAYBE THE PORN THAT IS MADE IS ALL THERE WILL EVER BE!!! It took 3 weeks, a new fiber internet line, and I had to invite my friend Tina over because this is a Herculean task. I downloaded over 600 hours of progressively stranger pornography from PornHub  and then, one I had the nuances down I want to the \u201cboutique\u201d porn sites for the \u201c Niche\u201d stuff. Nothing illegal mind you, but somehow feeling much better if it is in a brown paper bag as soon as possible or behind a dual layer VPN in my case. I live in a small community. I don\u2019t want Becky, who works for the cable company to somehow see all these over the top outrageous titles of webpages that are delivered to my house. Who in their right mind calls up a publication and says \u201cYes hello. I\u2019d like pa subscription to \u201cSlutty Stepdaughters That Crave Daddy\u2019s Cock\u201d and not just that title, send all others like it. \u201cI\nBefore you think I\u2019m some kind of pedo freak that you\u2019re hoping ends up taking a seat next to Chris Hansen of Dateline: To Catch a Predator. I will tell you how the porn industry works in a footnote. * [Note 2]\n\nI\u2019ve done nothing illegal. I may have morally offended you.  The porn industry is big business. With lawyers, accountants, and record keepers that make sure these are consenting adults trading acting for money. It\u2019s a job. What society wants to do is one of two things. \n1. Apply a person\u2019s morals on it and they declare it wrong. \n2. They are actually judging the actors. The woman who is in college or a single mom. These aren\u2019t low life scum. They are people trying to survive like you and I do. Afford them the fact they are working, paying taxes.\n\nThis visual sextravagaza started  when my friend Louie said he could edge his orgasm 28 hours. With only pee breaks, water, Light snacks eaten with one hand while stoking his uncut European pud. I thought what\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve gone.  There was that time on coke and MDMA where it took 8 hours of damn near shiatsu massage to get it to wake up. Then 10 minutes to cum 8 hours 10 minutes. Not bad. Proudly I take Louis up on his offer and state loudly over the phone as I\u2019m at the mall, \u201cLook Louis you\u2019re on mate! I\u2019m gonna do 50 hours of edging until I blow my load!\u201d Young mothers giving me the stink eye as they hurry past me with their vanilla cones and vanilla lives. \u201cVanilla today and Moosetracks tomorrow!\u201d I snear at them as stated seeming so bland and normal. And that IS how it is.  So even though a pandemic is cause not to go out and people are mandatory distance 6 feet apart. I know this somewhere in this depraved city people are engaging in DP with ATM and I immediately want a BBBJ at a bukkake party and add my wet genetic code to the ever-growing opaque sea that the monkfish inhabits.\n\nA bukkake party is NOT easy to find without knowing the right people. You don\u2019t holler over the fence to the neighbor next door who knows everything about the local social scene. If you don\u2019t know what a bukkake party is don\u2019t ask her.  Especially her. Don\u2019t ask her.  \n\nPorn, fetishes, sex toys are are fairly normal now. Except in Texas. In some counties you can go to jail and have your children taken away from you for possessing a dildo. So, fuck you Texas. Stay out of people\u2019s sex lives. You don\u2019t want women to have sex toys but then they may get horny and meet a guy at a bar. She\u2019s not usually the one night stand type but it\u2019s either that or risk jail over an illegal plastic dick. So she and \u201cTom\u201d and insurance salesman from Colorado hook up and go back to his hotel with its roaches scurrying into corners as the room lights up. Two dozen college kids raising hell in the next room. Coke dealer in the next. You can grab an 8 ball and he\u2019ll give you 15 minutes with \u201cBrandi\u201d for another $50. Brandi has seen better days from the looks of the bruise on the side of her face and the tracks up her arms. Each room down the hall gets worse. Heroin and dirty bent needles. Rats crawling over a guy who just shot up and may or may not be breathing. One thing is for certain, any Narcan around here was stolen or used years ago. This is Russian Roulette where the losers are the winners and the winners are the losers. Think about that. Yeah, deep ain\u2019t it. It\u2019s the fucking truth because to wake up from that nod, that soft warm world and wake up in the heroin hotel is worse than dying.  Half the junkies I\u2019ve own have told me man it\u2019s not about having to have the junk. It\u2019s about the pain of finding yourself still here. That pain of something like when mommy tied me to a post in the basement and beat the shit out of me because having me destroyed her chance at going to interior design school.  \n\nThe worst part about this room is the carpet. It\u2019s fine for a second then you feel your shoe sinking and getting stuck. It\u2019s wet. Very wet. \n\nWhat the fuck. The ONE FUCKING TIME I LEAVE DURING THIS GODDAMN PANDEMIC because I\u2019m horny for a bukkake experience. Which, lamely I chortle  the phrase \u201cgiver not receiver\u201d  because if there\u2019s one thing you want to be sure of at a bukkake party, it is which team you\u2019re on. Some people like to give. Scratch that. I think MOST people prefer to give but it cannot be a sport without the other team. And by team I mean the man or woman that takes it on the chin. Literally.  And the forehead. Same with nose, eyes, hair,  breasts, tummy. Over and over again until what rises is slightly similar in appearance to something you\u2019ve seen. Then it hits. A monkfish. A bleached white fucking monkfish. And it tries to speak. Parrrparr toooler? Huh? What? Ahahah! It wants the paper towel. \n\nI can\u2019t ever think of a place if I was the recipient at a bukkake party where I\u2019d bounce to next.  It\u2019s not like you can really bar hop. Semen doesn\u2019t come out of hair easily. The minute soap and hot water touch the hair with wet to crusty dry cum is the moment you wish you\u2019d jut saved water and cut the hair off. That shit sticks.  \n\nI digress. There AREN\u2019T many places you\u2019d blend in at after a bukkake party.  But, I just had an epiphany. And I know what the fuck the smell in this hotel room about and why my loafers have sunk in so far that I can feel a wetness on my ankles then feet. Some freaky ass mother fuckers had a piss party here. Water spots. Golden showers. Mighty sword fights. You could get away with coming here and they would welcome you in happily willing to clean you up. You hear zippers unzip quickly. The sound of keys jangling as pant are dropped. Or do you say \u201cdrop trou\u201d?  Not at a piss party. Drop me and hose me down. Oh dear god. That old man is aiming at her 19 year old teen\u2019s mouth. You stand in a state of shock. A rescue must happen. Then, as you eat running for the door you notice the teen, who you thought was innocent is pissing on a man in a latex gimp suit. Well at least the urine beads up on the latex like a freshly waxed car.",
