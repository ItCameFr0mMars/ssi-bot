The reddish glow of the setting sun shines through the window as the beams of light show a fine dust filling the air of your hospital room. You dry cough and grab your throat as it has probably been weeks since you\u2019ve tasted drinkable water. The IV drip connected to you is completely empty, the subtle hum of the AC and the hospital electronics is nowhere to be heard. It\u2019s dead silence. You weakly stand up to look out the window, squinting your eyes and wiping the crust away as your eyes are still adjusting. You can believe what you see, you desperately lean against the window just staring in utter shock at your city that has been all but decimated, and is completely desolate.",
