I noticed posts moved slower in the mornings (I'd log in at 6-7ish am EST), and gradually picked up throughout the day. I'm not sure where the peak was - in the afternoons and evenings it was often pretty fast and furious. The mornings were generally relatively slow. \n\nWhen the best time to post was a double edged sword though. If you post at a popular time, the post drops quickly, so unless it's something particularly attention grabbing, it may not get many responses. \n\nI often got the best response in the morning because it stayed high up long enough for people to read it, and there were few enough posts that there wasn't an almost identical post that came along 5 minutes later (or you posted 5 minutes after someone else). \n\nIf you have a prompt that's a little out there and really need a lot of people to see it to get a response... might be best in the afternoons/evenings.",

            "body": "I'd like to see a spread on frequency of posts for given hours of the day.  Essentially when are posts more frequently made vs less frequently made.  Then, I'd like to see that information broken down for the different \\[A4B\\] tags.  Essentially when are M4F posted most frequently vs. F4M vs. M4M vs. F4F etc. (not trying to exclude anyone just using the four most common examples).  Are F4M posts more frequent at different times than M4F?  \n\nWhy am I interested in this?\n\nI have a theory that the time of day when you post matters because if you post when others in your 'tag category' post more frequently, your post might get drowned in several others posted around the same time.  I am working off the assumption that when someone is looking to respond to a post, they search for the proper tag (a male looking for a post written by a female will search r/dirtypenpals \\[F4M\\]) and sort those posts by New.  My guess is people don't scroll too far down before choosing some posts to respond to because the longer a post has been up the more likely that person has found a partner and is now occupied.\n\nI have a second theory that someone will write a post and look for posts to respond to in a similar time frame. \n\nIf my working theories are correct, then ideally someone would want to post when similar tags to their own are less frequent and when the opposite tags are most frequent.  Those two might not be the exact same time, but there may be a sweet spot when the former is on the decline and the latter is on the incline causing a 'sweet spot'.",

You're not using one of the filter links like https://fm.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals that would only show results for a certain tag, are you?\n\nAs far as the usefulness of this analysis - There *is* a ton of factors that this doesn't account for, true. Given the demographics of the sub, someone posting F4M with a popular kink is going to generally get more replies than the same post if it was gender-flipped as M4F, no matter when they both post, for example. But I think it does adequately answer the question I set out to answer, as far as whether there are better days to post than others: By the numbers, any given day on DPP will be much like any other, and the metrics remain pretty consistent across the week.\n\nUltimately, though, there's only so much that data analysis will ever be able to tell us, even if we had hard numbers on every possible factor of the sub, because you can't quantify the human element.",

            "body": "Anecdotally, from looking at posts, I do think that (excluding the insomniacs) there are generally waves as certain time zones wake up. For instance, there's an hour where most of the posts from the UK/Europe start to come in. And there are peaks at night but especially in the morning. \n\nFor me, the posts very late at night in my time zone tend to feel low-quality. More, \"this is what I'm into\" vs. an excerpt from a story or a really solid plan for one. I think that's because it's night time in the rest of the US as well so you see everyone who is just bored and looking for some amusement from 8pm onwards. I don't know if that reflects the majority of people looking at posts or just the posters. It's difficult to sort patterns in posts from the potential audience who is a complete mystery. \n\nDo you go with posting when you think like-minded posters (and potential partners) are most active? Or do you wait for a time when you think your detailed prompt will stand out in a sea of low-effort posts?\n\nI do think F4F and M4M posts have their own dynamic separate from F4M and M4F posts. Unless you're always filtering for them, they get a little lost in the shuffle so I don't know when those posters/that audience is most active.",
