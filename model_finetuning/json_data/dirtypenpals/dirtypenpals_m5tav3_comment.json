The same goes for a goofy title or witty lines in the prompt itself.\n\nBut if the prompt doesn't have those basic must-haves, I feel it doesn't make sense to write back. Obviously, if it just throws the kink/theme I'm craving and say \"whatcha think about that?\", I feel like I'm being asked to complete phase two of drawing the rest of the owl. The same goes for prompts that cover everything, making me feel like an audience member that should start clapping. So, I look for a prompt that sets up the basics of how the author sees the story developing and what they seek, sets up their non-negotiables, and asks for my input as the reader. I might end up not responding to a prompt that is brilliant in all ways, but where I feel like I'm bothering the fantasy of the author if I add to it.",

And then I have to see if their title seems like something I could be interested in playing out, if it doesn't include things I'm not into, etc.  \n\n\nOnce I find a title that I'm convinced I could like, I check the writing, primarily the basic gist of the prompt and the kinks and limits of the person to make sure we're not too opposed on those. Enthusiasm goes a long way, and even in prompts I wouldn't have cared about, reading a very excited and well-written prompt can make me consider looking through their other prompts. On the other hand, being overly abrasive (\"Ugh, since none of you know what a password is...\" etc etc) hurts its chances. Finally I check that they don't RP solely outside Reddit and Discord, since I only use those.  \n\n\nSo in a nutshell, about all those things in this post matter to me\\~",

Someone can write a really engaging little piece of fiction, but if I finish it and I have no idea what they want--rp or chat? pm, discord? long term, short term?--then a lot of time I just won't reply even if it's an exciting post because I can't craft a good response without more information.\n\nMy ideal post gives me an idea of the person's creativity of course, but it tells me what they expect from the roleplay itself, so that I can either know its not for me, or try to craft a post that will really spark their interest. Without more information, I'm just guessing.\n\nI use the same philosophy in my own posts. Here's my story idea first. Next, my kinks. After that, the things I'll ask of you to begin the collaboration. Finally, my big non-kink limitations (new accounts, one liners, etc).\n\nOf course, it all has to start with a subject line, and that's important too. \n\nCrappy subject lines include things like \"multiple prompts inside\" \"looking to chat with other [type of person]\" and things like that. A good subject is informative \"Looking for a daddy for an asian sorority girl [DD/lg, WMAF, chastity],\" or \"Looking to explore an oral-only RP.\" A GREAT headline is clever, both telling me enough to know whether I should click, and making me want to click.",

Creative ideas are certainly nice, but sometimes the simple ones are also just as fun.\n\nPlatform, as long as it's Discord or Reddit PMs work the best for me personally since I use them the most and usually only care for those platforms. Time zones don't mean much to me since I'll usually post and play whenever I can (but delete or \"hide\" most if it doesn't do well). Noon, Midnight, any day of the week, America, Europe, Japan, they're all fine with me as long as they're understanding of the difference in time.\n\nThe prompts I might respond to are ones that are incredibly long and detailed, and even if they are interesting, I worry that I won't be able to write a quality response for what they're looking for. Novella-like posts are honestly a little intimidating just because if it's strictly the prompt, I have no knowledge if the poster wants a reply that continues their post, or if they want to talk first, or whatever. There's been a lot of posts that I've loved the idea for but never had the chance to play just because I don't really know what it is the poster wants in a post or reply. The ones I definitely try and respond to are posts with a very clear and concise idea, whether it be long or short, and they know what they want. It usually doesn't result in anything since I usually suck at introductions anyways but it's still nice to know what the poster wants specifically just to make things easier.",
