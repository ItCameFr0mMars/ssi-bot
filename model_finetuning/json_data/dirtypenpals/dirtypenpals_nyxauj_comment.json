He would grope her all the time and even occasionally grind on her to cum. She allowed the groping without comment but was a little hesitant for the rest but still allowed it. She just told him,'' not to get carried away'', he asked her why she let him and she said, ''she loves him and knows he doesn't have a gf''.\n\nYears later they're both grown and married, both living in sexless marriages. They get to chatting about old times and realize how miserable they both are, she pulled him into a bed room, bent over and dropped her pants. He asked why and she told him,'' I know you're miserable''. They never had actual sex, he just pulled his dick out and dry humped her nice ass over her panties, and they both left feeling, like they'd been shown real affection for the first time in years.",
