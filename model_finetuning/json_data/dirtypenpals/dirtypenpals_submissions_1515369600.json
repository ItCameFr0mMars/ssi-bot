            "selftext": "*The continuation of my previous prompt :)* \n\nDarkness falls and I come to the realization that at some point throughout the sun\u2019s descent, the whines had ceased.\n\nSauntering back to my bedroom, I gingerly push open the door and peek inside. On my bed, my boytoy lies, right where I had left him several hours ago, the plug still dutifully vibrating in his ass. I stroll over, and that\u2019s when I see it. Spilling forth from his gorgeous cockhead, pooling above it and trickling off to the sides of his torso \u2013 Semen, thick and creamy. There were no jets of it anywhere, only the gentle, peaceful assembly of it on his belly. It had trickled out his beautiful member, drop by tantalizing drop.\n\nI\u2019d made him leak pure cum.\n\nMy gaze trails upward to his face, and my breath catches in my throat. He\u2019s staring right at the ceiling, face blank, eyes vacant. My fingers pull my panties from his mouth once more, an act that elicits a response from him.\n\nHe turns, slowly, to look at me.\n\n\u201cHi\u201d, I say tentatively, my expression one of cautious excitement.\n\nHe says nothing, igniting a tiny spark of hope within me. \n\nI dash to the kitchen, fill a bowl with water, and chuck a healthy bunch of ice cubes in it. The water is freezing cold by the time I\u2019m back in my bedroom. Placing the bowl aside, my hand makes its way to between his legs. His hips lift in a slow, controlled motion, allowing me to easily pull the plug from his butt.\n\n*He knew what I wanted,* I found myself thinking, as that spark blossomed into the smallest of flames. *And he helped give it to me.*\n\nPicking the bowl up, I dip my fingers in its contents, and sprinkle the length of his cock with them. Before long, his captivating 8-inch is a much smaller, flaccid 3-inch, and I set the bowl down on my bedside table. Opening the drawer, I retrieve a pink, plastic chastity cage, which I slip on him. Next, I grab a towel and wipe off the mess on his abs, allowing myself teasing caresses of his muscles in the process. He doesn\u2019t make a squeak or do a thing the whole time.\n\n*Is this it?* I wonder. My clit is throbbing **hard.** \n\nOnly one way to find out.\n\nI undo his restraints, knowing that if I\u2019m wrong, my fate is sealed. There was nothing stopping him having his revenge on me. From doing *anything* to me. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t move a muscle, despite being free. The flame turns into a raging fire.\n\nFrom my drawer of toys comes a 7-inch dildo, complete with balls and a suction cup at its base. I lube it up and present it to him.\n\n\u201cI wanna watch you leak again\u201d, I declare. \u201cFrom within your cage this time.\u201d\n\nHe respectfully takes the dildo from me and, still lying down, arches his hips just enough to be able to slide the fake cock inside him. It enters him effortlessly, the base pressing into the mattress, and he begins fucking it slowly and sensually. I can tell he\u2019s angling himself just right so that the dildo is rubbing against his prostate, and within seconds his cream is dribbling out the tip of the cage. I tear my eyes away from the mesmerizing sight to take a glance at his face. It\u2019s still vacant, empty \u2013 Possibly even more so than when I first saw him that way, earlier.\n\nHis palms turn downward and his hands grip the sheets to anchor himself, never breaking stride in his rhythmic love-making to the dildo. A few seconds more of this depravity is all I can take, before the screaming of my pussy becomes too much to bear. Peeling off my panties, I climb atop the bed and mount his face in one swift motion.\n\nHis mouth and tongue go *wild.* I don\u2019t even know what is happening \u2013 It feels as though he is licking, sucking, tongue-fucking me all at once. All I know is that I\u2019m cumming. So. Fucking. Hard. My juices begin to cover his cheeks, his nose, and his jaw as my orgasm rolls on and on, an eternal nirvana. I collapse forward, hands frantically clutching at the headboard. I want to stop cumming, but his mouth, it won\u2019t fucking let me. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know anymore. I must be in fucking heaven. Then suddenly I\u2019m on my back and he\u2019s sitting upright, and two of his digits are inside me, filling me perfectly. Two finger-fucks and two rubs of my G-spot equals four seconds of uninhibited squirting. And this\u2026this *thing* doesn\u2019t even stop. He keeps fucking going. Is he sucking on my clit now, too? Sweet fucking Lord.\n\nSo today, I ended up breaking one of the finest male specimens out there, and turning him into the ultimate, dedicated, female pleasure machine.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to show him off to my friends.\n",

Shoulder-length brunette hair, big brown eyes, pouty pink lips, smooth skin, perky little breasts, a thick, round ass, and long, smooth legs. She was incredibly kinky in bed too. She was constantly wrapped around your cock. Always stroking you, always sucking you, always riding you, so be it. She'd call you 'daddy' and let you pull her hair and spank her. Her roommate had just gotten out of a pretty bad breakup, and she had been dating the guy for the couple of years. And now that they're broken up, she's left completely cockless. So one day when you're alone at the dorm with your girlfriend, she brings up the idea of a threesome.\n\n*\"Come on, baby, it would be sooo much fun! I've caught you checking my roommate out on multiple occasions... when you're over at my dorm... when we're out at lunch... when we're studying at the library together... I know you've thought about this at least once...\"*\n\nSo you decide to give it a try. Wouldn't hurt, right? I'd love for this roleplay to turn into a whole romantic/sharing kind of ordeal where you inevitably end up dating both of the roommates. Sharing is caring, right?\n***\nI have no limits. I love rough sex, hair pulling, spanking, messy blowjobs, deep throating, gagging, anal, choking, riding, reverse cowgirl, 69'ing, double penetration, the works.\n\nShoot me a PM and let's start talking!",

            "selftext": "You hate how familiar that sound is starting to become.\n\nClink. Clink. Clink. The slow, measured pace of a pair of boots on the sterile plasteel floors leading to the small housing bay I\u2019ve allotted for you in my ship. Maybe cell would be a better word for it. 6 feet by 6. Just a bed, washroom facilities, a small shelf, and a basic VR unit. Practically out of the dark ages. And all closely monitored, naturally. It\u2019s honestly a little surprising just how many direct feed cameras you can hook up in just 36 square feet. It felt confining at first, even claustrophobic. Maybe you\u2019ve started to get used to it over the past 2 months. Maybe you haven\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s far from a big ship to begin with. Little more than a personal yacht equipped with trans-galaxy thrusters and a big of extra cargo space. But then again from your perspective it could be a full-on corsair class ship and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Let\u2019s just say you don\u2019t exactly have the run of the place. One way of putting is that you lead a very structured life. Another way of putting it is that you\u2019re a slave. My slave. And no it\u2019s not because I\u2019m evil or some kind of species collector or something. There\u2019s a very good reason for why I\u2019ve acquired you, the best reason really.\n\nHumans are very, very profitable.\n\nYou see ever since humans joined the Stellar Collective, it didn\u2019t take long before the word got out. Human cum tastes better than literally everything else. In every galaxy, for every species, human cum is an unparalleled delicacy. The irony is that they\u2019re the only species that doesn\u2019t really seem to enjoy the taste all that much (except for Zorblaxians but don\u2019t even get me started on those guys). Demand is insanely high. I mean just look at the numbers. There\u2019s what, 15 billion humans, give or take? Compare that to the 4.5 quadrillion living members of the Collective. All efforts to synthesise it fall miles short of the real thing (ever eat one of those steaks that comes in a can? Yeah, it\u2019s worse). And on top of it all, there are remarkably few humans willing to become career cum producers, in spite of how lucrative it is. You don\u2019t want to know how much a full vial of human cum goes for on the open market. Like I said, profitable.\n\nSo yeah. I bought you. Freshly captured. A real live human. God knows how much you would have gone for if you had hit the market. I called in every favour in that slave ring that had snagged you, all to get early access, and even without a hundred other smugglers just like me trying to outbid me I could still barely afford you. I had to put you on ice, a full 2 years in cryo before I had enough saved up again to make the adjustments needed to my ship. Let\u2019s just say your average cargo yacht doesn\u2019t come equipped with a milking rig, especially not geared for humans. The living quarters at least had been simple. Human physical needs are pretty basic by Collective standards.\n\nSo yes, I suppose in a way my interest in you is sexual, but not in any sense that a human would define as conventional. Lord knows I wouldn\u2019t need to expend one fraction of the effort I put into you if I were just looking for physical intimacy, since 9/10ths of the Collective has got it bad for Tillonians, a fact I\u2019ve used to my advantage more times than I can count in my smuggling career. It\u2019s no secret why either; soft, almost gelatinous pink skin with purple freckles, gorgeous, expressive faces, and ample trio of flawless breasts, all of that is just scratching the surface.\n\nClink. Clink. Clink. Those footsteps again, getting closer now. I had flown us far out of the system we had been staying for the past 2 months while I ran tests. Slowly orbiting some nameless giant on the back of one of its moons. I must have scanned the system a dozen times, probing farther each time, going to the detection limits of the ship\u2019s scanners. Can you blame me? I was covetous of my prize. Finally I had convinced myself we were alone. Nothing registered in a sweep of 20,000 parsecs in all directions. We\u2019re alone, and I\u2019m more than ready for my investment to start earning dividends. It\u2019s time for you to get milked.\n\nWhy hello there, thank you ever so much for reading this far. I\u2019m Maxine, and I\u2019ve got something a little unusual in mind, as you might have noticed. The essential premise of the scenario is one in which I milk you, more for profit than any strong desire to dominate. With that being said however, I should stress that everything I\u2019ve outlined in this prompt is just that; an outline. To me the best part of playing this out is seeing how the roles and interpersonal dynamics between us change over time. Do you come see me as a protector of sorts, showing you affection that you never knew in your old life? Maybe you resent me, hating me stealing you away from your old life and subjecting you to a life of slavery. Maybe we even become friends, as you overcome your initial rejection of the situation I\u2019ve placed you in and come to want to know me better as a person? There are all sorts of ways that things could play out. That being said, while I know that this prompt obviously lends itself towards submissive partners, one thing I am not looking for is the typical \u201cYes ma\u2019am, thank you ma\u2019am\u201d attitude, I find there\u2019s not really all that much room to explore in dynamics like that. I will in a way be dominating you, but a little nuance goes a long way.\n\nBesides the sexual components of this RP, which are obviously important, anyone who\u2019s up for world building intermingled with the sexy stuff goes to the top of the list. I\u2019m super into it, and if you are too then we are definitely going to get along. Maybe you get loose and try make a break for it? Maybe I get picked up on scanners by Collective authorities and have to make a run for it? Maybe you get stolen by rival smugglers and I have to steal you back? There are galaxies of possibilities to explore.\n\nI\u2019m quite open minded when it comes to kinks, and the basic nature of the initial setup lends itself well to a lot of different directions if there are kinks you\u2019re especially fond of and would like to incorporate. Maybe I mod your body to produce more cum for me? Maybe getting to go to your living quarters and you spend most of your time locked in the milker? Maybe Tillonians have like 50 ears or something? All cool by me. One kink of mine that I\u2019ll make a point to mention is me playing as a futa; I\u2019m quite fond of it, and I feel like it would work well for my character in this. It\u2019s not essential, but anyone who\u2019s into it gets bonus points. Other kinks include restraints/bondage, orgasm control and denial, ass play (talking about your ass here specifically, though mine isn\u2019t necessarily off the table), noncon (flexible on this, it can vary a lot based on how you want to take the story), weird/cool sci fi stuff (especially related to stuff the milking setup can do), premature orgasms (yes I actually like this), and forced orgasms, just to name a few. My only hard limits are age-play and bestiality; besides those let\u2019s party. Also this prompt is totally open to trans* people, really anyone with a cock qualifies.\n\nI won\u2019t be on too much longer tonight, but I kinda figured this would be more of a long-term thing anyway. I do have a life besides dpp (sadly), but I try and respond at least semi-frequently. So if any of this rambling mess appeals to you, and you think you\u2019re a creative person, then by all means send me a message. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m back. A little worse for wear (such a long story), but I have come back from the dead and hope to find some play with the wonderful partners on DPP.  I am combining my two archetype posts into one (because quite honestly, they really are related).\n\n\n**---Seeking a man that needs multiple women.**\n\nEver since I was little, I fantasized about being one of many. Special insofar as I am one of those many, but nothing beyond that. In high school and college, I had my fair share of threesomes, as I often made it clear to people how I'd love to join, but that was often awkward when it was clear I wanted to be a toy for the man of the three (who was usually someone's boyfriend).\n\nI want to hear your fantasies of having multiple females that serve you. And I'm begging, please say more than \"Sure, I\u2019d love a harem.\u201d Why do you have so many girls? Is it looks? charisma? money? mind control? Has the end of the world happened and most men are dead? Are you sweet to your girls...or are they property? Is it a family (incest and ageplay are perfectly fine!) or a bunch of strangers? Do you have a certain look you go for, and if so what? A certain personality?\n\nI'm mostly a fan of modern day realistic fantasies (as it allows me to think about actually BEING in such a situation) but I'm not against fantasy situations, dystopian futures, kingly pasts etc. Bonus points for the fantasy that breaks the fourth wall and helps me imagine how I could escape my (honestly happy, if very busy) life and enter such a situation.  \nA few examples, though please don't just take one of my examples as your own without your own creativity added to it. I can masturbate to my own fantasies all day long...I'm here to know about yours.\n\n* the high school athlete or teacher/coach that has the cheerleading squad as his personal little harem\n* a father/step-father that owns his entire family, including his lovely daughters\n* a man who marries a deeply submissive and giving woman, who in turn gives him all of her bridesmaids as a gift\n* a fertile man in a world where male fertility is mostly non-existent\n* a psychological/computer/pharmacological genius that comes up with a way to mind control/hypnotize/drug whomever he wishes into pure submission\n* a man that dates a college sorority girl and ends up having the whole house to himself\n* the next Hugh Hefner (RIP)\n* etc!\n\nTo be clear, a simple MFF threesome is fine, but what really excites me are those sort of images of a man that can have a 'lot' of women. Four...ten...a dozen...fifty...more? \n\n**---Wanting to be the perfect partner.**\n\nIncorporated into this fantasy is my desire to be the perfect significant other.  In my mind, the perfect submissive female partner lives to serve the man she calls boyfriend, husband, Master.  Keeps a perfect house, knows that she should be ideal arm candy, and a sexual dynamo.  I picture the mix of the 50's housewife and the perfect whore, who would think nothing of you fucking the wife or cute daughter next door. (And in fact would likely think more of you, particularly if they were very attractive.) The sort of girl who would wear an apron and nothing else, have a batch of cookies in the oven, and would only stop you from fucking her over the kitchen table long enough to get them off a cookie sheet so they wouldn't burn.  The sort of girl who would be horribly disappointed if on our honeymoon, you did not spend much of our time fucking other newlyweds.  That's me.  \n\nI know I am not the typical girl. I crave pleasing my partner, and am quite willing to go to extremes to do so. I want him to be so happy that the smile that lights up his face permeates his very soul. He wants for nothing.  If it's not clear from this...I'm deeply submissive...I CRAVE pleasing. I love giving pleasure in many forms...but am just as happy to watch the one I care about being pleased, taking pleasure FROM that.\n\nIf someone who knew you down to your soul were going to create the perfect partner for you, the sort of girl that \"I\" want to be for someone else, what would she be like? This is not a three line response. What sort of body would she have? What sort of personality? Is she submissive? What skills would she have? A good cook? Masseuse? Yoga instructor? Does she speak languages? An artist? I want to know these things. Does she believe, like I do, that a man should not be limited to a single woman? (Obviously, many of those are things \"I\" value in myself and want to give to a partner...forgive me, I'm biased!)\n\nHopefully, these responses will lead to some RP if we are compatible, so obviously I'm more likely to respond to individuals that seek in a woman that I want to be, but truly...I want to know your wants...your cravings, even if we aren't 'the same.' In short, if the perfect girl were to suddenly just enter your life, who would she be, and perhaps, how would it happen?\nA primer about me: Asian, in my 20's, petite but chesty (and \u2018still\u2019 considering having an augmentation).  Very \u2018bendy.\u2019  Submissive to the core, but not huge into bondage. I believe that my dream partner is entitled to as many women as he wishes, and I will help him have that. Big kinks: MFF+ (obvs), oral, clothes, uniforms, impregnation, incest, and many other things. \n\nIf you have gotten this far (**CONGRATS!**), I look forward to your responses (sorry for the length of the post).  Have some pictures of your dream girl? Share them. Ideas for the types of clothes she\u2019d wear? Throw them my way. (If you\u2019re going to send pictures/gifs, please send classy stuff. Porn is wonderful, but I want to see the girl you find most beautiful. And please, no dick pics unless I ask. I could make a substantial collage of the unwanted dick pics I\u2019ve received.)  Short little nothing messages will be ignored straight away (you can see I like to write)\u2014Please put some thought into your response.  Requests for pictures two seconds in will likewise be ignored.  I have no problem sharing myself with another, but not until I have gotten to know them first.  I try to respond to \u2018every\u2019 post, but the last time, I underestimated the response and posts slipped through, and for that, I am sorry.\n",

Hell, I enjoy that, in an out of bed, even if in bed isn't the faintest bit lewd. Maybe I do have a thing for leaning over you, and bearing into you with all my weight, stretching you and spreading you and keeping your wrists pinned so firmly your fingers can only flutter against the sheets. \n\nSometimes, yes, I enjoy spanking you. Not some ritualized, ponderous game with chants and weird titles and *yes master*'s. Just the sheer sense of electric thrill, of sinking into you and feeling that glorious emptiness in my palms that I can fill with *you* in one exuberant strike. I can feel it now, just thinking about it - that moment, with you rocking and groaning in my lap and on my cock, where all the force in the world can't stop me from reaching around and letting delicious havoc rein down on your ass. \n\nAnd sure, it's pretty fun to play around a bit, leaving the seriousness of the world behind. I'm a grown-ass man with more Pusheen stuffies than I've got knives, barbecue tongs, or Rolexes (or some shit that's more daddyesque, I suppose - I'm just channeling my inner Ron Swanson for a moment). You're welcome to snuggle up in a pile of them, naked and giggly, and I'll dive into bed beside you and glory in that childlike glee.\n\nNot that roughness isn't fun; there's a thrill to be had in letting my passion roll out in a wave, mind you. And, well, I do tend toward the dominant side, and a smaller, cuter partner is hardly a negative.\n\nBut you know what? I'm perverse in this, but I really, really, *really* have a thing for similarly grown women with whom I can talk and laugh and go on silly nighttime walks with. The sort of partner who's equally at home *doing* things out in the world, and gasping into the sheets on a lazy Sunday morning. \n\nLook, I love it if your eyes sparkle and you can lavish praise on my cock. That's great. But I've got this weird fucking kink for ladies who can wax eloquent on other subjects, who I can watch light up with passion about one of *her* passions. \n\nSo.\n\nYeah, I'm quite fond, and *extremely* willing to, sweep you up and pound you into the bed. Perhaps steal your breath with my tongue and brush the thoughts from your mind with a well-timed flicker of my fingers, a teasing kiss along your skin. I *want* to see your eyes empty of thoughts with a gasp, and it's so much more fun to do that when you've got a lovely mind to distract.\n\nI'm me, and you're you, and I would *love* to do all manner of awful, lovely things with you and to you.\n\nBut I am *not*, I need to be clear, *your god-****damn*** *daddy.*\n\n---\n\nKinks: Sex. Between interesting and thrillingly equal adult humans.\n\nLimits: The word daddy.\n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/)\n",

            "selftext": "*Panzer_Girl*, posing a *Girls und Panzer* prompt? Whatever is the world coming to? Normalcy, probably. I love Girls und Panzer.\n\nDo you know what else I love? *Yuri.* Cute girls kissing cutely, scenes of romance and heavy blushing, with nervous kisses exchanged in quiet corners... it's *pretty great,* or so my rapidly-expanding collection of yuri manga keeps telling me.\n\nGirls und Panzer has practically *infinite* potential for cute yuri business, and anybody who has seen it knows what I am talking about. So, considering I have a 4 image limit, lets talk about the ships.\n\nShip #1: **[Darjeeling and Kay](https://i.imgur.com/LPt5kDI.jpg)**\n-\n\nThis is the hill I have chosen to die on. Even if all of the other ships fail, I will go down believing in this one. They *work* together, in the same way that a cat and dog can be best friends. Darjeeling's \"be elegant in all things\" attitude almost *needs* the craziness of Kay to balance her out. Sure, they are the respective commanders from *entirely different schools*, but that isn't the type of thing that would actually stop anyone who wanted to pursue a relationship. \n\nShip #2: [Yukari and Miho](https://i.imgur.com/jo2zeZI.jpg)\n-\n\nYeah, yeah, I *know* it is babby's first GuP ship. It is the most fleshed out. The most *obvious*. The way Yukari crushes on Miho is... I mean, it's blatant. Complete that with Miho telling her friends she loves all of them *shortly after* she has a talk about not really wanting a boyfriend, and then add *that* to the fact that Yukari practically *loses it* when Miho 'confesses'... sometimes it is nice to have safe ships.\n\n^(Is girls kissing while clothed NSFW? I hope not. I mean, it's *lewd*, but it is lewd in the same way that handholding is lewd.)\n\nShip #3: [Katyusha and Nonna](https://i.imgur.com/Nw7rwSy.jpg)\n-\n\nIt feels a little weird to list this one, because I... don't buy this ship. I mean, there *could* be an unrequited thing, where Katyusha is tsundere and Nonna is dense (man, spell check didn't like that series of words), but... I think that Nonna is more of a big sister type, than anything. Of course, \"breaking the big sister\" is practically a trope of its own, so there is that whole element to work with... This is not my least favorite GuP ship. I do not even talk about my list favorite GuP ship *you dirty* ***dirty Miho/Maho shippers WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU THEY ARE SISTERS AND HAVE A GOOD SISTERLY RELATIONSHIP*** \n\n\n\nShip #4: [Maho and Erika](https://i.imgur.com/lIIr2jm.jpg)\n-\n\n***THIS IS WHO YOU SHIP MAHO WITH YOU DIRTY MAHO/MIHO SHIPPERS I SWEAR***\n\nAhem. Moving on.\n\nThis... isn't a bad one. Especially with the character development we get from the movie, we learn that these aren't *bad people*. Maho is a quiet stoic villain because that is what the Nishizumi school *demands* of her. This is the same Nishizumi school that Miho *failed*, and... in the absence of a little sister to support her, perhaps Maho came to rely on Erika for more than just tactical assistance. Perhaps she came to rely on her for... *physical affection*.\n\n***maho isn't/wasn't banging her sister though***.\n\n---\n\nSo, those are the four ships I can link to. Maybe you like other ships! Maybe you just want to talk about tanks! Maybe I put too much thought into all of this (though if you think that I have bad news for you I have written *essays* about Kayjeeling and it all stems around the Sherman Firefly and seriously *it's all there if you loooook*) and you feel the need to tell me off!\n\nWhatever! Just PM me!   ",

            "selftext": "Edit: Just to clarify, I'm looking for people to make up their own character or characters, not take over Jessica.\n\n\n(So this is a rewrite of an older prompt of mine. I guess I should put a warning that it's kinda offensive so yeah, don't read if awful things turn you off.)\n\n***\n\n\"And through our Lord Jesus' name, Amen.\"\n\nThe echo of Amens signal the end of the bible study. It's a small one in a back room of the church. Not a primary service, but a study held for those special cases who need a little more extra help than what they can get from the regular Sunday services. Recovering junkies. Battered wives. Struggling Christians.  Metal folding chairs form a circle, and eyes move towards one girl in particular who closes her bible on her lap, looking up, a weak smile on her face. Her name is Jessica.\n\n\"I just can't express how happy I am to have you here with us,\" says Mrs. Parsons, an older woman who's been going to the church for years. She's been like a grandmother to Jessica.\n\n\"Mhm,\" concurs Susan, a refreshing maternal figure in Jessica's new life. She's been helping Jessica every step of the way after the hospital visit, and seems to genuinely care about her like no other.  She's in her early 40s, with short blonde hair, and is very pretty, but Jessica doesn't think about people sexually like that, of course.  Not anymore.  \"We can all see it in your eyes, you seem so much happier since you've been with us.\"\n\nJessica smiles, a bit shy, looking down and brushing her black hair out of her face. \"Thanks everyone,\" she manages to say.\n\nPastor Smith, who conducts these weekly studies, chimes in. \"How true it is. You're living proof that people really can change, Jessica. These past few months have shown that God turns nobody away, that he embraces all those who forsake their past sinful lives, and takes them back into the flock.\"\n\n\"I know,\" says Jessica. \"I can feel his love every time I come here. I'm thankful for the support each and every one of you have given. I've really changed my life around, and I have you all, and God, to thank. I feel like...\" She bites her lip and looks down, unsure. \"...I feel like maybe, maybe I really am going to go to heaven.\"\n\n\"Praise Jesus,\" says Mrs. Parsons, shaking her head and looking up to the ceiling.\n\n\"Now then,\" says Pastor Smith, putting the good book away and turning to housekeeping matters. \"I'll be mailing out the church picnic invites to everyone on the mailing list later this afternoon, and then we can...oh, what's this?\"\n\nHis phone goes off, and then someone elses, and then another persons. Everyone's phone goes off at once, and finally Jessica's phone chimes. There's a slight chuckle throughout the group.\n\n\"Are you sure you didn't already send those invitations?\" someone says to more laughter. Everyone pulls their phones out, and goes to their email, checking it. Before Jessica manages to do so, she hears a gasp. Mrs. Parsons turns white. Susan looks disappointed. Other people start going pale, shocked expressions on their faces. Pastor Smith frowns.\n\nJessica looks at the email. It's been sent to the entire church mailing list, from an unrecognizable address. She opens it up, and her heart drops.\n\nIt's full of pictures of her.\n\nIn the first, she's naked, on her back, and covered in semen. Several hard cocks are just visible at the edges of the picture. Her white, petite body is bare for everyone to see. Her breasts are small, nipples big and hard. Cunt shaved smooth. Biting her bottom lip as ropes of cum drip from her face.\n\nThe next picture, her face looking back while her ass faces the camera, a fist in her asshole, stretched wide. She recognizes that arm.\n\nIn the next, she seems to be laying in a filthy alleyway, naked, and covered in vomit. Her head is on the floor, and she looks defeated, eyes red and watery, every inch of her naked body covered in filth.\n\nIn the next picture, a plastic bag is over her head, air vacuumed out, her face pressed tightly against the plastic, gasping for air, face dark red, her naked body covered with awful words in black marker. \"Garbage.\" \"Whore.\" \"Cunt.\" \"Piece of shit.\"\n\nIn the next picture, a great dane is mounting her, fucking her from behind as she looks up at the camera with a dazed face, her tongue hanging out of her mouth like a bitch in heat.\n\nIn the next picture, her legs are spread wide, and another woman is in the frame, her fingers from both hands dug into Jessica's stretched asshole, and her rectum is blown out, prolapsing outside of her body.\n\nThe pictures keep coming, dozens and dozens of them, depicting all the awful things Jessica used to do. Dildos rammed down her throat, visibly expanding her neck. Enormous toys shoved up her loose asshole. Shots of her naked in public, masturbating. Laying in a tub full of piss. Documentation of all the abuse she allowed herself to go through before she found God again.\n\nJessica looks up, tears in her eyes, and is met with a circle of shocked, disgusted, and enraged faces. She does the only thing she can do, and gets up, running outside of the room and into the church's main hall.\n\n***\n\nThe email, of course, originated from my phone.  It's been far too long since I've seen my best friend, so I'm getting her back.\n\nI see the wayward friend in question run out from a side room and dash up the middle of the church's main hall, between the two rows of pews. She collapses to her knees at the front of the empty room, in front of the pulpit and the large cross overhead. It's nice to see her again after all this time. Younger than me, at 23, and smaller, physically. She's 5' nothing, and maybe weighs 90 lbs when soaking wet. Really cute, easy to fall in love with. Light skin, with black hair, chin length, in a bob cut. Big, round, dark brown eyes. A petite frame with a little round ass and perky B cup tits.\n\nHer's is a lifetime of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, started by her insane mother and her mother's multiple boyfriends when she was young, continued by any number of her own boyfriends growing up, and finally, as an adult, by me. She had no humanity when I found her, so she was always a perfect fit for me. A genuine masochist. Fully accepted that the reason she was born was to suffer. A human being that's ruined, basically, and although she may have attempted a grasp at redemption with this church thing, I'm not going to let that happen.\n\nSo here I am.  I'm Isabella, and physically, the complete opposite of Jessica.  I've been described by people as \"walking sex\". I think it fits. I'm 32 years old, and physically imposing at 6' even, with a thick, voluptuous, hourglass body. Long, full legs, a huge, round, high-sitting ass like a shelf, a narrow middle, and big, heavy, natural tits sizing up at 38H. Bold facial features, full lips, bright green eyes, with short, slicked back blonde hair dyed platinum. My Sunday wear today is a nice, breezy, Summer dress, yellow with black polka dots. It's far too short, and when I walk, it shows off my bare cunt. My pussy is built like the rest of me: thick and meaty, a puffy mound with large lips, and a prominent, visible clitoris. My hefty bra holds up my enormous tits, showing off plenty of cleavage, which tends to wobble about with each high-heeled step.\n\n\"Are you crying?\" I ask as I draw near. Jessica hears, but doesn't respond or look back.  \"I suppose the church group got the pictures, huh?\" I slowly drop down to my knees behind Jessica, my voluptuous body making Jessica's look like that of a little girl. I lean my lips in to her ear, savoring the sounds of her sobs. \"Did they find out what a disgusting piece of shit you are?\" I wrap my arms around her, my hands moving across her belly, her breasts, feeling her. I missed her. \"Did they see how vile, how evil you are?\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" she says, not moving.\n\n\"That's my girl,\" I say, smiling. \"I do too.\" I move my hands down her body, and slowly hike up the front of her demure, beige dress. I slip my fingers underneath her underwear, feeling her clit, her cunt. \"It's wet, and your clit is stiff. You can't help it, Jessica. Self-destruction gets you off. It gets both of us off. It's okay. Embrace it. What were you trying to do here, redeem yourself? Get a way into heaven? You're not going to heaven. You're going to hell.  We can both go to hell together...\" I lean my face down, kissing her on the neck, tenderly, as she shakes in my arms.\n\nI look up at a large cross above the pulpit, and sigh, holding onto Jessica. \"We can pray together,\" I say. \"Lord, fuck you. Please send us to hell when we die. Eat shit, Amen.\"\n\nI laugh lightly as Jessica shivers, and I pat her ass. \"C'mon, lift those skirts up. I want to shove my fist up your ass.\"\n\n***\n\n(So I'm looking for a longish term partner to play this out on a slow schedule. Maybe like one post a day or so. No limits here. I'm into both the physically disturbing as well as depressing psychological sadomasochism.)",

            "selftext": "I gape at the door for several long seconds as I feel my heart pounding in my chest.  I wasn\u2019t sure I had actually heard what I thought I had. But just as that though passes through my mind, the sound of a heavy hand knocking against my front door echoes through the house once more. I suck in a breath as I stare at the door with wide eyes. Swallowing as my throat goes suddenly dry.  And then I shake my head chuckling at myself as I move towards the door. I tell myself that it is nothing to be alarmed about. Just because knocks on my door at 3am in the morning are not common that does not mean that they are sinister.\n\nMaybe somebody just needs help and since I am probably the only person on the block who is up and has their lights on at this time they came to my door first. Sometimes staying up late on your nights off to maintain a 3rd (midnight) shift sleeping schedule can be a pain in the ass. I pause and frown as I look down and catch myself reaching out to undo the lock. I shake my head and the happy feeling that had taken over me fades and my old fear returns. \u201cW\u2026\u201d I pause and have to cough to clear my throat as my voice comes out in a squeak. \u201cWho is it?\u201d. I pause and then the I hear a reply. It is strange though the voice is on the other side of the door, it is as clear as if the speaker is right in front of me \u201clet me in\u201d it says softly \u201cI need  your help\u201d. The voice is deep and almost relaxing, but there is something about it that makes the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand up. \n\n\u201cI..I will let you in if you tell me who you are\u2026.what you need\u201d I say as I press my hands against my stomach over the loose, off the shoulder, Naruto, sweat shirt that I am wearing pared with a pair of black leggings, the straps of my sports bra sticking out of the top. \u201cLet me in\u2026 I have something for you\u201d the voice says in a low almost seductive voice. I let out a soft gasp as I feel cold metal against the palm of my hand. Looking down I can see that my right hand was reaching to open the door. I grasp my own wrist and physically tug my hand away. I swear that I can hear a low breathy chuckle\u2026but how would I hear that through the door? \u201cI thought you said you needed help?\u201d I ask as I step closer to the door. Going up on my bare tiptoes, I press my eye against the circular peep hole. My large breasts press flat against the strangely warm door.\n\n All I can see is what looks like the tall broad shoulder figure of a man in a hoodie, his face completely in shadow. As he shifts his face I cannot see any features\u2026except his eyes, they are like heated pools of melted silver as they seem to glow in the shadow from his hoodie, reflecting the low gleam of my porch light. And it seems as if he is staring right back at me. But how does he know that I am looking out at him. I step away from him and lift my phone up.  Looking down at the screen I let out a cry of dismay and fear\u2026 no bars, I have never had any problems with reception here. \u201cLet me in Amber\u2026or I\u2019ll huff and I\u2019ll puff and I\u2019ll blow the fucking door down\u201d the voices says pleasantly and there is another low chuckle.  \n\nI am looking to play a bit of a cat and mouse with build up before the monster either tricks me into letting him, or entering on his own. It does not have to be the big bad wolf (it also doesn't have to **not** be the big bad wolf). I just liked that for a title. \n\nDPP [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5b1bt8/34_f_amberbriz/)\n\n",

Your grades were not the best but that is not deterring you from giving it your all and really showing what you\u2019re made of. \n\nThe university you\u2019re attending has a foreign language requirement to graduate. Most are easy enough but you in your lusty, yellow fever driven moment of foolishness chose to take Chinese. There were a lot of nice legs and flat faces to look at from your peers but the teacher was something else. \n\nThat\u2019s me. I am a Chinese woman at the age of 36 with C cup breasts and jet black hair that reaches a bit close to my mid back. My legs are long standing at 5'7. I have a slender frame and a decent ass.\n\nAs if my looks were not distracting enough, my class was among the most difficult in the school. \n\nSo much for your New Years resolution. It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear you will not pass and if you do it\u2019ll be by some miracle. Why not just drop the class? You\u2019re no quitter. Especially since you know the body I\u2019m rocking isn\u2019t. A body ripe for fucking. A perfect body for you to take and make your little fuck slave. \n\nMy kinks are raceplay and humiliation. I have hard limits at gore and scat. If you\u2019re detailed you\u2019ll get a lot from me. \n\nI want to give everyone a chance so don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t get a response immediately. This is only during work hours for me so I hope you\u2019re okay with a bit of silence. I\u2019m looking more for long term so if this is just a wank and drop it might be best to try somewhere else. \n\nHope to hear from you all",

Now I never was one of the scene girls in school, but I always found myself getting excited by the girls who were.\n\nI'd like this to be set in high school (as seniors), or in College. It's not a very fleshed out idea. I just know that I want to be a scene girl. But let's set something up together! I'll kick us off by getting you to choose who I play!\n\n1 - https://i.imgur.com/eQhpoCv.png\n\n2 - http://imgur.com/a/s263N (Not quite scene, but getting there :3 )\n\n3 - http://i.imgur.com/oti5zgH.jpg\n\nI won't be responding to one line messages , or messages that contain your cock size.\n\nPlease put \"Boop\" at the start of your message, but not in the title :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "\"Abby, this is *crazy!*\" I can hear under the exasperation and anxiety in my voice the thinnest thread of excitement, and I don't like it. \"I'm going to get arrested, indecent exposure or something -- \"\n\nAbby made a derisive snort and tossed her dreadlocks back into as tidy a cable as she could manage as she continued work on her canvas -- that is to say, me. \"Are you kidding me, sunshine? This is downright modest compared to some of the other stuff that'll be on display out there this weekend. Trust me, if the cops can't be bothered to shut down all the mobile pharmacies and smoke shops, they're not going to give a sweet shit about your cute ass.\"\n\nShe gives my cute -- if a little soft -- ass a smack. I wince. It doesn't feel bad ... in fact it feels pretty goddamn good ... but it does seem more sensitive than usual. Maybe it's the paint. More likely it's my imagination. I wonder for the hundredth time how I let Abby talk me into this. She's always been the oddest of my friends, but despite that -- maybe because of it -- she's also been the closest. Outgoing where I'm shy; outrageous where I'm reserved; a tree-slobbering hippy where I'm a buttoned down conservative; and, of course, cheerfully bisexual while I've always been straight as an arrow.\n\nOkay, there was that one time we made out in college, but it never went anywhere and I couldn't look her in the eye for the next three weeks. She, of course, merely collapsed into giggles whenever it was mentioned. \n\nBut one thing I can say for her -- she always knows when to swoop in and cheer me up. So when my marriage, already on the rocks, sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic along with the *Titanic*, she was on my doorstep within a week of the divorce papers being signed, handing me a brand new knapsack and a backstage pass to the Widening Gyre Festival. \"It's just what you need,\" she insisted, quite deliberately not giving me time to think. \"You've been all caged up and locked away for much too long. Go wild for a few days, why not?\"\n\nWhy not? At least it wasn't Burning Man. And as Abby pointed out, I was always a Yeats fan. \"Not that nine tenths of the people there will get *that* joke,\" she grinned, a merry and mischievous gleam in her eye. I should have known not to trust that little gleam -- it always spelled trouble.\n\nSo here I was shivering in nothing but a much too small thong and a spiked leather collar, hands stretched over my head like a figure on a Grecian urn, the tarpaulin that covered the floor of Abby's pavilion (closed to the public at the moment, thank god) splattered with white and orange and black splashes of paint, a Jackson Pollock frenzy of a tiger. And a rather more convincing tiger glaring at her former best friend. \"You're nuts! Give me a jacket or a sweater or something, ok? I mean this is ridiculous -- \"\n\n\"No, this is *Art.*\" I could hear the capital A. \"You agreed to be my entry into the living canvas contest, and I am sick of taking home the second place ribbon. And you'll make much more of an impression if you're out there on the hunt as much as you can be -- as much as you *want* to be.\" \n\n\"I thought competition was a tool of the pig patriarchy?\"\n\n\"Not when I win, it isn't. Now hold still.\" She knelt down behind me, her slender brushes teasing at the backs of my thighs, putting finishing touches on my stripes. Involuntarily, I shivered. Despite my protests, this whole process had aroused the hell out of me, and I had no doubt Abby knew it. Kneeling down at my feet, turning my legs into the powerful hindquarters of a bipedal tigress, she could probably *smell* it.\n\nI chanced another glance in the mirror she'd set up, not recognizing myself. I was glad I'd lost a bit of weight the last six months; I didn't relish the idea of prancing around like this showing off a decidedly un-feline muffin top. There was still a bit of softness around the edges, but my curves were firm enough, and what had aged Abby had managed to disguise with her paint: orange and black melding together seamlessly into tigerish stripes, a blaze of white from my mouth down my throat, cresting along my bare breasts, down my belly to disappear under the thong, which was itself a pale orange, intended to blend with the greater mass of the paint. My face was perfectly adorned in the suggestion of a feline muzzle, whiskers and all, my mouth drawn in gleaming black and my eyes made huge and almond shaped with that same distinctive hue. The blues of my irises were hidden under unnervingly convincing pale gold contact lenses, the pupils correctly round instead of slit. \"They're going to be looking at your stripes, not your tits,\" Abby had insisted. I wasn't so sure.\n\n\"And now for the piece de resistance ... \" Her hands looped a slender silver chain around my waist, a long plush tiger tail depending from the backside, heavy and strangely comforting against the cleft of my ass. Abby tightened the chain, two strands of slack dangling over my left hip, chiming musically as they rang together. She leaned back, studying me critically, then clapped her hands together with an enormous, fiendish grin. \"You look perfect!\" Experimentally she ran a hand down my spine, hard enough to make me yelp. \"And it's not smearing at all! Oh, Kathy, you are going to have *fun.*\"\n\nI scowled. \"I doubt it. I think I'm going to hide in the back of your tent.\"\n\n \"You'll do no such thing. You're going to get out there and prowl. Have fun. Be wild, for once in your life!\"\n\nShe shooed me out of the tent, and I found myself at the edge of a seemingly endless crowd, shivering, my arms crossed over my bare breasts. *I'm too old to be here,* I think at first ... but among the wildly dressed people milling about, laughing, beating drums, passing joints back and forth, and seemingly having the time of their lives, I see quite a few people my age, and some a *lot* older. And more than a few of them are even more outrageously clad than I am. I feel myself blushing under the paint. Slowly I relax my arms and wend my way into the crowd, toward one of the musical pits where a punkish band is playing something loud and energetic. \n\nPeople cheer me. People point -- not laughing, but in delight. One girl remarkably in looks likes Abby feigns terror and I laugh a little, raising my fingers and hooking them, showing off the little black claws Abby pasted over my nails, faking a snarl until I dissolve into self-conscious giggles. The sun beats down on my painted skin and for the first time in ages I feel *freed* and *wonderful*, warmed by the sun in nothing but my skin ... and my stripes, of course. \n\nWidening Gyre takes place in a northeastern river valley, not the desert, and so there are a goodish number of hilly outcroppings for people to camp out on, rocks for a Kat to climb. Feeling adventurous I clamber atop one of them, feeling the air lift my long red mane of hair (carefully clipped to conceal my ears, so the only ears people see are the tufted black tiger ears perking from my scalp). Below me is a circle of nine or ten college students, enthusiastically debating whether Eliot or Pound was the worse anti-semite.\n\n\"Pound,\" I say, authoritatively. They all look up at me, startled, giving into delight as they see the craftsmanship of Abby's paints ... or the crazy naked broad painted as a tiger, whichever. \"Eliot was only an anti-semite as a hobby. For Ezra it was more like a profession.\"\n\n\"Better listen to her,\" says a young man with tumbled jet black hair and keen grey eyes, smiling up at me with total fearlessness. \"Cats would be the experts on Eliot.\"\n\nHe invites me down to the circle, introducing himself as Nash. \"Not Ernest Hemingway on safari?\" I inquire, grinning lopsidedly, bracing down on my hands and knees as if I'm about to pounce. Maybe Abby is right. Maybe I *do* need this.\n\n\"Miss Tigress, even if I had a rifle on me, I wouldn't have the heart to point it at you.\"\n\nI laugh and leap from the rock, landing beside him, catching his shoulders in my pawed hands, the two of us tumbling to the earth, laughing. He's just barely young enough to be my son, but something in his eyes tells me he doesn't care.\n\nLater in his tent, the thong carelessly torn away, our bodies joining in a rhythmic pulse, sweat mingling, the tent explosive with the heat of our bodies, my clawed fingers hooking into his naked chest, riding his cock, crying out against him, mewling, his hands greedy on my ass, one thumb pressed confidently to the tight hole under my tail -- he didn't ask if I'd like that; just knew what it would do to me -- I don't even remember how I got here. Not kissing him, but licking his lips, panting against his throat, lapping up his sweat, sinking my teeth into his skin as my orgasm twists deliciously through me, drawing both a cry from his lips and a hot jet of cum from his cock.\n\nSlowly I relax against him, licking the place I bit. His cock slips easily out of me as my striped hands wander his rangily muscled chest. Abby did her work well -- the stripes haven't run a bit.\n\n\"Is your name really Cat?\" he asks breathlessly, stroking the back of my neck. I lower my head to his chest, delighting in the touch.\n\n\"What else would it be?\" I ask throatily.\n\nHe laughs, uneasy for the first time. \"Could you at least tell me what color your eyes are? I mean ... I know you must not have anywhere to put those lenses ... but I just ... I'd really like to know.\" \n\nI raise my head and peer deeply into his eyes, my own feline irises inscrutable and depthless. \"They're just what they seem to be.\" My tongue darts out and flicks at his mouth.\n\nNash sighs, then smiles ruefully. \"Well, I'm sorry you want to remain anonymous. But tell whoever painted you ... they did incredible work. But they had something incredible to work with.\" He blushes, as if he's not used to such sentimentalism coming from his mouth.\n\n\"I'll tell her.\" I stand up, stretching languidly, shivering as the secret places in my body clench with the memory of him. \"In fact, I should go find her. She's probably looking for me now.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He bites his lower lip. \"I'm going to be here the whole festival.\"\n\n\"So will I.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he says again. \n\nAnd maybe I'll look for him. But right now I want to *prowl*. I blow a kiss -- then make the same clawing gesture I did to the girl earlier. He laughs a little, absently rubbing a place on his chest where I scratched him. \n\nI step out into the night, delighting in the warm summer breeze on my naked skin, savoring the smell of sex that clings to me. It's funny -- I hadn't thought Abby had painted me under the thong, but the stripes and white blaze continue uninterrupted between my legs. She even frosted my little patch of red hair a soft, silky white.\n\nThey've lit the fires. I hear primitive drumbeats like tom-toms, calling all wild things to them. I turn and slink toward the glow of the fires, my eyes reflecting their dancing lights, the tail swaying from the silver chain against my calves, the tip curling and uncurling as if it were alive.\n\n",

            "selftext": "It's been a while since the great dog uprising. All the male humans have been wiped out and all girls under the age of 40 were put into new \"human\" pet shops and sold to the new dogs at top of the food chain. In this new world dogs have gained great intelligence, they are able to speak human tongue, with a bark or two here and there. They remember the way we humans would trade them off and keep them as pets. Now the tables have turned, and it's very sexual. Even worse now, they've found a way to make us human girls breed with them.\n\nI've been in this really tiny cage for the past 4 days, completely naked except for a pink collar. Every second day they've showered me and shaved my whole body except for my hair. They've given me cute purple pedicures and make up to make me seem more \"pleasurable\" for new dogs wanting to buy cute toys to play with. Most of the time I spend in my tiny cage, with my little toes sticking out of the railing, or my little cunt pressing out against my will. Most dogs look for pretty girls, some to treat well and others play with.\n\nUntil today. I see you, a rather large, muscular, black pitbull/Rottweiler mix. You look at my toes first and then my whole body. You have this very hungry look in your eyes, showing off those sharp k9 teeth at me. Your eyes wonder to the top of the cage where a sign says \"Galina, white girl, 27 human years, pure bred dog virgin. 200$\". Another dog, the owner of the pet shop comes by, \"interested in her? She's a good looking one\". You keep looking up and down at my little body, plump breast and juicy tits. \"We have a no return policy, but hey, if you don't like her, I can recommend some good recipes to make a nice roast out of her hahaha\". I shiver as I hear those words, I've almost forgotten that dogs, now the top of the food chain, have grown a taste for girl meat too. \"We'll see about that, I'll give her a few days to prove herself as the new chew toy of the house before I decide to make a nice meal out of her\" you laugh while saying. You can clearly see the fear in my eyes and with that I hear \"I'll take her\"\n\n(Well, i would love to find someone to continue this with, it's pretty dark but a huge turn on for me. I was hoping we could incorporate some sort of race play into this (big black dog vs little white girl). I'm also more than happy to share photos of myself too to make things easier, just ask! And we don't have to go too dark into the eating me up part, it's just a nice piece of taunting I decided to put in. Feel free to continue and ask anything, and I'll reply!)\n\nGalina\n",

            "selftext": "This is how it\u2019s all going to end. You and I adrift in space, locked inside an escape pod. We\u2019re going to die here, make no mistake. Likely by one of two possibilities. The first is hypothermia. The climate system will be put on reserve and then eventually shut down to preserve power as we foolishly hold out for a rescue. We\u2019ll die of hypothermia roughly 45 minutes after all environmental control ceases to operate. \n\nThe other option is suffocation. We could keep all systems going until the pod is depleted of power and thus the ability to cycle air. Based on the size of the pod, the amount of oxygen we need, the amount in reserves, and the build up of CO2, we\u2019re looking at about 4.75 hours before we die. This is a tiny ass pod. \n\nBoth scenarios are unpleasant, to be sure. But them\u2019s the breaks, kiddo. It\u2019s our reward for thinking we belonged out in space. You see we are pioneers. An Adam and Eve for the second quarter of a newish millennium. Chosen not for superior genetics, although our scans showed no significant abnormalities, but because we are painfully normal. \n\nThe folks back on Earth decided to build a space ship about as easy to operate as a vehicle from the early 21st century. I believe they said it\u2019d be close to driving something called a Chevrolet. And they then decided that since average is... the average, sending two average people to plant our flag in the soil of a new world made a ton of sense. So when shit started breaking because we course corrected, hewed a little too close to the orbit of a moon and were thus redirected into an asteroid belt, well, let\u2019s just say we aren\u2019t engineers.\n\nWhen you reach under the seat you\u2019re strapped to and you fish out an old typewriter from the 1960s, I start laughing. Of course. We\u2019re a gazillion miles away from Earth, bound to die painfully and fairly soon at that, and what do you grab on your way out of the exploding Chevrolet? Your typewriter and a packet of paper. But we both knew when we bailed ship that there was no hope, so I suppose bringing a typewriter made about as much sense as anything else. And then you popped the cover off your cherry Olivetti Valentine manual portable typewriter (you made sure to tell me the make and model), loaded up a sheet of paper, and you started typing. Our goddamned pod that\u2019s maybe 3 meters square is filled with an echoing *clack-clack-clack* and then a *fuck* as you backspace, because the gloves we\u2019re wearing give you the ultimate fat fingers. I watch as you try to direct your encased sausages to the right keys, cursing as you hit several at a time, jamming the little typey thingies together so that you have to remove the top, push the typey thingies back down, and start over. Your pristine white astronaut gloves now have ink-stained fingertips, and your helmet is fogging up from your constant stream of hot breathed curses. After realising that my peals of laughter are sucking up precious oxygen I stop and lean in to see what you\u2019ve composed. \n\n\u201cSomeone is bound to find us at some point,\u201d you say as you roll the paper out and hand it to me to read.\n\n****\n\n11 January 2251; 19:17 hours\n\nDear NASA,\n\nFUCK YOU FOR TELLING US WE DIDN\u2019T NEED TO KNOW HOW TO FIX THE GODDAMNED SPACE SHIP.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAstronauts XX &amp; XY\n\n****\n\nHuh. This is a pretty good idea. Someone is going to try this again, and maybe NASA will have them swoop by and snatch up our escape pod since it\u2019s supposed to have a data storage unit. We transmitted telemetry and diagnostics regularly from the ship, but only the highlights. The recorder on the pod is a back up that details exactly when and how and why we were fucked. Upon boarding our pod and booting all systems we discover that data retrieval is not just impossible but also almost completely corrupted from the blast. To the point that navigational data stored in the pod\u2019s main computer is unreadable, now random bits with missing strings and not enough information to map a course back the way we came. But NASA doesn\u2019t know this, and at some point *someone* will follow our intermittent data trail and find us. We need to let them know what happened and how we spent our last moments in this tiny, shitty escape pod. \n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d I ask, pointing to your typewriter. You hand it to me as I adjust myself in my seat and place your machine in my lap. From the packet of paper I remove a fresh sheet, mimicking the way you rolled it in and up. \u201cWe *are* supposed to leave a detailed journal of our actions,\u201d I say as I start typing. I\u2019ve watched you enough to know just how to hit the keys to avoid jamming them, and I slowly peck out my first journal entry.\n\n****\n\n11 January 2251; 19:21 hours\n\nAstronaut XY and I have just concluded the first of ten experiments. Anal penetration via the front and rear evacuation ports of the AF22-Daf Multi-Environmental Protective Suit...\n\n****\n****\n\nHey DPP,\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. You and I are lost in space, pissed that we couldn\u2019t fix our ship. Is it realistic that NASA would pick two ordinary/non-rocket scientists to represent humanity in our first excursion to a new world? No, but it\u2019s more fun this way. So we are in our pod, trapped in these suits so that we can stay warm enough, and we have decided to leave a written log for whoever we hope finds us. Of course, I\u2019m really pissed at NASA, so fuck all their data collection efforts. Instead of leaving a truthful log of our last moments (we can decide if it\u2019s days/hours), we are going to fabricate a filthy, filthy log written in wonderfully descriptive but clinical terms. And we\u2019re gonna write our space smut on a typewriter from the 20th century. \n\nOf course we can decide a few other things like: Do our characters get so hot and bothered that they decide to shorten their life spans by taking the suits off and gettin\u2019 it on for real? Or are they content with staying in their suits and writing about stuff that never happened? Though I could envision them using those front and rear evacuation ports for a little self lovin\u2019... \n\nI\u2019d like this to essentially be them writing a dirty story together. They\u2019ll have to xxxx out stuff (it is a typewriter after all, there is no delete key, and Astronaut XY didn\u2019t think to bring white out), debate whether or not they want to describe removing the acceleration shift handle and using its two legs for... other purposes... etc. There are lots of fun avenues available!\n\nI hope one of you will find this interesting and join me in pretending to be an astronaut who\u2019s pretending to do dirty, dirty things all because we\u2019re mad at NASA.

Think Skyrim set in 2017, kind of. I'll play an Elven girl, and you can play anyone really. She's around 4'-something to 5'4\", nothing *too* impressive around the chest area butt still, that's not what counts right? She's got long white-blonde hair, pointy ears, and a taste for short skirts, thigh-highs and of course butt-stuff. \n\nI was thinking that perhaps our characters could meet on a night out somewhere, and we pick up the morning after back at my place, ready for round two? Perhaps the morning after, picking up with me dressed in one of your shirts and a pair of thigh-highs, maybe making breakfast? Or, you know, fucking on the kitchen table... \n\nMaybe we're already friends, or in some kind of relationship instead? It's up to you, really! Pick a scenario you like, or make up your own.\n\nThat's just a vague idea, so if there's anything you want to suggest then go ahead!\n\n\n\nAnyway, I prefer to play in first person, shorter (2-4 line) replies are fine by me, and as long as both of  are still alive by the end if it, it should be good. As far as kinks go, I like anal, oral, rough-but-loving sex (think facefuckings followed by a nice cuddle and a hot chocolate), and just about everything else! Feel free to spank, slap, bite, fuck and choke your way to orgasm as long as you give me a hug or two between the moans and the gags, alright?\n ",

I was kind, loyal, caring, giving, and so much more. I wasn't hard to look at either, with a very cute, pretty smile, nice long hair and fair skin. My body was thin, though the one thing I was lacking was a nice set of breasts. Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, except for my twin sister.\n\nShe looked exactly like me, only with enormous E cup tits on her thin, petite frame. Anytime I managed to talk to a boy alone and convince him to take me out, he pretty much forgot all about me as soon as he laid his eyes on her. If the two of us were together when we met him, he usually didn't know I existed at all.\n\nShe knew this too, and loved to make sure she was really flaunting her big tits whenever my would be boyfriends (or any boys) came around.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLooking to do scenes where my twin sister with huge tits continuously steals guys from me and my totally flat chest. The only difference in us would be that she has huge tits and is sluttier than me, which of course means all the guys like her better ;) I have a bunch of ideas for various scenes we could do with this, so PM if interested!",

You got yourself a good sized apartment right outside campus, fair rent, affordable by you and your two buds.\n\nSteve was the ideas guy, the one who had proposed getting the place. He insisted on keeping it laid back and girl free, unless of course the girl in question was a guest. He was the outgoing one, the sporty guy, the one everyone always liked. He was usually either going to parties and shacking up there, or bringing home guests. You liked him, he meant well, but he could be a bit much. At least he was out of the place most of the time and he paid his share.\n\nJames is more your pace. Kind of a nerd, a little on the quieter side, but bright and very funny. Super laid back, just content to spend Saturday night on the couch with some friends and the old N64. He's and engineering major, so he's got a big workload (which he won't hesitate to tell anyone about), but is social when he has time. He's had a fairly steady girlfriend as of late, some equally nerdy girl he met in some class or something, you don't really remember. She's usually pretty chilled out when she's around.\n\nAnd then there's you. Stuck in the middle of these two.\n\nYou've been pretty busy with school as of late, and you've spent most of your night stuck here, either catching up on work or catching up on sleep. You've missed out on the last few big events, let a couple of friendships drop off. You're not happy with it, but you've done what you've had to. You're just dying to have some interaction that isn't your roommate's, James' girl or one of Steve's random chicks.\n\nSo when a furious game of Super Smash Bros. was interrupted by a knock at the door, you volunteered to answer.\n\nWhich is, quite literally, where I come in.\n\n\"Uh... Hi.\" I shift my backpack on my shoulder, rocking back on my heels in the doorway. \"Is Steve around?\"\n\nYour face falls a little, but you recover. \"Yeah, but... er...\" You look back towards his bedroom, sock around the knob, \"I think he's busy working right now. What's up?\"\n\nI roll my eyes, knowing him. Figures. \"Well, since my wonderful brother failed to inform you, I'm his sister. I'm staying for the weekend.\" I play with the string of my sweatshirt absently. \"I was meeting some friends later, but he told me to leave my stuff here and I could stay... the weekend...\" I drop off, neither of us speaking for a moment. There's a beat.\n\n\"Can I come in? You know, so you can at least stare at me inside?\"\n\n(Sorry for the rather wordy prompt, but this is an idea straight out of my own life. The little sister of your close friend/roommate suddenly shows up on your doormat, innocent as can be. She requests a roof for the night, and maybe a bed. Will you be the gentleman and give it to her?)",

You can't even hold eye contact with her without constantly letting your sight line drop down to those plump, wet, perfect lips that are MEANT to be wrapped around a throbbing erection. This poor girl must think guys are staring at her chest, and yet she has no idea that they're more than likely actually thinking about facefucking her perfect pink pair.\n\nWhen she wears lipstick all you can think about is how that colourful contrast would look amazing against your girth. When she wears lipgloss all you can think about is how those slick, juicy lips probably feel better than most girl's pussy's. \n\nHer lips were made for dick sucking. So maybe it's time you put them to use?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo in case it wasn't clear enough, tonight I want to play a girl with a perfect pair of DSL's! Whether she's a stranger at a nightclub, a longtime friend that you've always lusted over, or anything in between, I want to be the girl with the plumpest, softest lips you've ever seen.\n\nIf the prompt makes you think of a perfect pair of lips, please send over the picture and I'll happily play that girl for you! Or at least someone with lips just like hers ;)",

Suddenly the electricity cuts, you find yourself staring blankly into a black screen. There was something different, something in the air. \n\nYou turn in your chair, the creaking of said chair so familiar at this point that it's music to your ears. Shock and awe wash over you as you realize there is a woman stood in your room. She is naked, her green creamy eyes flickering across your frame as if confused by your very presence. \n\nYour hand is wrapped hard around the armrest of your chair, your toes curled. You don't notice this though, you merely gaze at the woman, eyebrows furrowing as you find courage to speak. \n\nShe offers you a smile. \n\n_________\n\nThe idea behind this prompt is that a lucky man finds himself blessed by the presence of a woman. This is no ordinary woman, she is in fact entirely unique. \n\nShe is a magical being, a genie of sorts. Bound to you by pure chance, sent from the cosmos by a god you will never know the name of. \n\nHer abilities are unlimited, she is all-powerful. The catch is that you control her, she is bound to you forever. Whatever you want, whatever you say. So when you discover this what will you do? Fulfill all desires? Seek wealth? Women? Improve your own life, or others? \n\nI am interested in bestowing that power to one of you reading this, perhaps ending all this in a romance between your character and the genie herself. I am in it for dedicated roleplays with a partner willing to put the time in, so if you have a lot of time and enthusiasm that'll be a huge plus in my book.\n\nLooking forward to reading your PM's, help me reason with myself why you're the one to do this with.

My God, was he obnoxious. 30 minutes of talking about himself and not a second of it interesting. \"Yeah, I'm gonna go use the bathroom.\" You said before quickly leaving the room. Anything but talk to that bore for another second. You didn't even ask where it was so when you got up the first flight of stairs, you just started opening and closing doors to bedrooms that looked like they were never used. The fourth door you opened had someone in it, a beautiful sleeping girl with a black t-shirt and no pants on, just purple panties that don't even cover her whole ass cheeks. You know all this because she's rolled outside the sheets. This must be your step-sister, Emma. You turn to leave but as you do you hear her moan and wake up. She sits up on the bed, not covering herself \"Are you Carolyn's son?\" She asks, groggy and reaches to her bedside locker for chewing gum. You respond yes as she finds the packet. \"Step-brother!!\" She exclaims, with a piece of gum between her teeth. She starts chewing. \"Siddown, let's get to know each other.\"\n\nJump straight in from here. Don't introduce yourself. This roleplay is first person.",

I'm wet before you even touch me, and if I get to wrap my hands around your big rod and stroke back and forth while it slowly grows, feeling every inch, I just can't stop myself from taking\u00a0 the whole thing between my lips and sliding those over it too to feel it all, stuffing my eager mouth.\n\nAnd the taste, mmmmmmmm, almost nothing makes me lose my mind faster than the taste of cock. I love clean cock, but a dirty cock, where I can lick and drool and slobber and swallow every single bit of your pure masculine flavor, it's addictive. The salty flavors just fill my mind and make me crazier for you. \n\nThe only thing that does this to me more is the smell. Oh God, the smell of cock just melts my brain, and it's constantly around, but it's absolutely the strongest when a hard dirty cock is thrusting into my open mouth, it's like your fucking my brain itself and filling it with nothing but cock and cum and thoughts of serving you. \n\nThat's the other thing. I never feel more submissive, more in my place, than when I'm forced to my knees, worshipping the cock that so easily breaks me and takes me, turns me into a mindless whore. It's not my fault, I can't help it, I'm just a girl, and you have a cock, a big, hard, smelly, tasty, delicious, mind-breakingly amazing cock. \n\nI also love the feeling of that big fat hard dick I just spent an eternity slobbering over finally lining up with my dripping wet pussy, shoving in and taking me, using me like a powerless fuckdoll, use me for your pleasure while I scream and shake on you, clamping down, until you empty your swollen balls deep in my womb.\n\nThe only thing better than one delicious dick is two, or three, or even more, all shoving their way inside me, using my holes, roughly filling me with hot seed and covering every inch of my slutty body with cum.\n\nSo if you want to make me suck your cock, it's not very hard. Shoving it on my face works pretty well, once I get a whiff of just kinda happens.you can do even more if you want to be sure, being creative is always a plus, but either way, please message me. I'm craving all kinda of misogyny and humiliation tonight, so do your worst to me.",

I'm just in the mood to suck some dick and take it in the ass like a slut. Your age can be whatever you want, but my limit is 18 minimum. \n\nAlso, I might be interested in playing as your mother too! But I can't think of a setup for that. If you have one in mind and want me to be your MILF, let me know!\n\nI have pretty big tits and a nice thicker sized ass, so if you like thick bitches, I'm your gal!

The good news is that even though we aren't close friends, we've always gotten along--even though we hardly know each other. The bad news? We just found out we'll have to share a room. It's small, with just two beds, a chest of drawers, and a desk. There's not even a closet we could duck into to change. And while we've got our own bathroom, it's constructed rather inconveniently...the toilet is behind a door, but there's no door between the bedroom and the shower, and the door to the shower is completely transparent....",

            "selftext": "How does a college student find themselves wrestling some of the hottest girls on campus in the nude for the right to fuck the loser? Well, that's a bit of a story.\n\nIt started a few years ago in the basement of one of the sorority houses when some of the sisters who were student-athletes got a bit competitive one night. They pulled the rest of the sorority into their game and, eventually, girls from all around the University. Sure enough, the matches ended up becoming the talk of the campus within a few years, with everybody from freshmen to grad students gossiping about them in hushed whispers.\n\nNo pictures or videos were allowed to leave the house, of course, but the stories spread like a wildfire. Who had beat whom, how they fucked them, which girls were rivals - everybody had heard bits and pieces of the story, but nobody knew all of it except for the girls who wrestled and the select few invited to watch.\n\nEvery Saturday night, the wrestlers and spectators made their way to the same basement where the tradition had originated for a night of raunchy fun. The rules had been tweaked over the years, but they were eventually etched into tradition themselves:\n\nPinning your opponent: 5 points\n\nGetting your opponent to submit: 10 points\n\nForcing your opponent to orgasm: 25 points\n\nGirls wrestled in 3 five-minute rounds. In the first, they start in a bikini. If they haven't been stripped by the second round, they begin nude anyway. The first person to reach an agreed-upon point total or who has more points at the end of the fifteen minutes wins the match.\n\nTheir reward? The loser. They get the right to fuck the loser however they want for fifteen minutes. Most girls choose to use a strapon, but dildos, vibrators, and other sex toys are common. They often force the loser to get them off by eating them out. Occasionally, there are some more... unorthodox prize rounds. At the end of the night, everybody goes home, and nothing remains but the stories.\n\n_________________________ \n\nHey DPP! How are you? Today, I'm bringing a prompt that has been a fantasy of mine for a long time. I'm looking to roleplay this out with a detailed writer. I only ask that you play a girl, but other than that, the choice is yours:\n\nWho are we? Freshmen? Best friends? Roommates? Heads of sororities? Club presidents? Grad students? Why are we wrestling? To impress a sorority in the hopes of getting in? To settle an argument? Or are we just total strangers randomly drawn to wrestle each other tonight?",

            "selftext": "(First of all, thanks for even clicking this prompt, its a little out of a lot of people's comfort zone. OOC below prompt, all characters are 18+ seniors)\n\nLife was pretty much hell for Callum.\n\nOn paper he was basically your average, geeky high school student. He listened to music, played video games, spent too much time messing around on the internet. The usual mundane stuff that was typically associated with your teenage years. He was willing to admit that he did slant a little more towards the 'nerdy' side of things than the more 'popular' kids in school. The teen had a confessed love of obscure fiction, anything Lovecraftian was especially up his alley.\n\nNone of this however had anything to do with the reason he was an outcast in his small town school. Kids could be cruel to geeks and nerds but they were always especially shitty to Callum. The reason being, he looked like he could front page /r/androgynoushotties.\n\nHe didn't think he was particularly feminine, but his slender swimmer's build,  bleach blonde hair that got in his eyes and penchant for skinny jeans and loose t-shirts was enough to get him labeled as a freak among his classmates.\n\nHe had no idea why he decided to look this way. To him it just looked beautiful. His classmates didn't agree. On the first day of school back from winter vacation he decided to wear eye liner to school, it looked awesome. Someone decided to throw all of his clothes into a toilet while he was in gym class that day to send a message.\n\nNowadays he kept mostly to himself, trying to avoid contact with anyone else. His lunch hours spent reading with his headphones on, music cranked up loud enough to avoid hearing the other students call him 'faggot' or alternatively 'dyke'. If he was being fully honest, he did get some enjoyment out of the fact that they couldn't zero in on a gender for him in their insults.\n\nOf course he had spent time researching gender identity. You don't decide to model your appearance they way he had without some thought given towards what that means. After a lot of research and watching a LOT of porn to see what got him off, he decided he was a transcurious pansexual male. That same extensive porn exploration lead him to believe that he was also extremely kinky.\n\nIt was a mouthful but it seemed to fit. He also decided that he wasn't going to have any degree of romantic or sexual satisfaction until he made it to college. For now it was just a matter of sitting and waiting, keeping his grades up and avoiding as much unwanted attention as he could.\n\nThat is until she came to school. Well, at first Callum wasn't even sure she was a she. In fact, he had to force himself to admit she might not be a she. She might be something else. His mind just kind of associated the pronoun with the person (especially after he found what he found on the internet that night).\n\nDressed in a loose fitting military jacket with bright blue hair, the first day she came to class there was basically no telling if she was a boy or a girl. It was only when she reported to gym did Callum discover that at least biologically the system had decided she was a girl. \n\nShe was (*they were*, maybe they didn't use gendered pronouns?) fucking gorgeous.\n\nHe was a little ashamed to admit that he totally cyberstalked her that night. Even more ashamed to admit that he found those pictures on the internet. Yes. THOSE pictures. And even MORE ashamed to admit how much cum he had milked from his thick teenage cock looking at them. \n\nHe vowed that he would make an exception to his \"talk to nobody\" rule the next day. He was going to find out he she was.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nCharacter description is just for reference, feel free to create your own androgynous hottie.\n\nBiologically, Callum would be male and your character would be female, however, your character could have a much more fluid gender identity  (a little how Callum is transcurious and pansexual).\n\nHope you like it.\n\nI love a lot of kinks, rimming, watersports, rough sex, etc. Nothing is \"must have\" though, so don't feel like it's got to be a raunchy kink fist.\n\nNot into actual abuse though, more in a kinky slut kind of way (think Adriana Chechik or Megan Rain porno).\n\nAnyhow, let me know if this is up your alley.\n\nKinklist: https://i.imgur.com/YT17n2u.png (Depending on the caliber of your posts I won't hold myself to a hard \"No\" on blowjobs and deep throat if we eventually get to some pegging action, Callum is only into women, but if that woman has a strap on, he might be interested). If you're VERY persuasive I might be interested in playing with a Futa. \n\nAnd here's part of an ongoing Steampunk story I'm working on: https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3ovifu/share_smutty_steampunk_story/?sort=top\n\nEnjoy.\n\nOh, 3rd person only please.",

I stretch and sigh and begin to remember my dreams from last night... so dirty and filthy, which explains why I've woken up particularly horny this morning. \n\nI squeeze my legs together in frustration. My pussy already wet and clenching. I roll back over onto my back. I have so much to do today but the tension and ache in the core of my being won't let up. My hand slides down my body, lightly touching and rolling my nipple between my fingers. I quickly realize that my dreams have left me in a state in which a light teasing play will do nothing. So I bring my other had up and start to roughly pinch and twist each nipple. I harshly stretch them away from my body as I bask in the pain, my back arching off the bed and a string of moans living my mouth. After a few minutes my nipples are both sore and red, however the ache between my legs has only grown in intensity. \n\nI move my right hand down from my nipple into my soaking panties. Even I\u2019m slightly surprised by just how wet I am. I can feel the pool of my slick that has begun to gather in my panties, either from my slutty dreams or tormenting is my nipples I don\u2019t know. A finger rubs against my slit, gently, a little harder, finally I'm rubbing and adding pressure to just the right places. I glance over at the clock and know I need to stop playing games and start getting ready for the day like a decent, grown women. I push a finger inside as the other continues rubbing along my clit but it's just not enough. I add a second finger. Rubbing, pumping, twisting... still nothing. No release. I sit up suddenly with a frustrated yell... so wet, so dirty, so horny and no relief.\n\nKinks- pussy play. domination, humiliation, being owned- but gentle and cared for when appropriate. dirty talk. pet play.",

It doesn't matter that you had simply bent down to pick up your can of Bouncy Bubble Beverage (Now with Licorice flavor!) and he tripped over you. Now you're a troubleshooter with your snazzy **Red** jumpsuit and you're on your way on a mission to sector XXX, where a fertility experiment gone wrong has left the members of this sector free of the normal libido suppressants and hormones that all good citizens of Alpha Complex take. Your mission brought you here and the meds you take are running out, even the happiness officer's supply is running low. What will you do when the horny citizens of sector XXX actually catch up to you?\n\n\nGreetings! I am [friend computer](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WgN68CQxvR4/UcPbfrmMlZI/AAAAAAAABFc/pRjXXmJajMQ/s1600/3orzv8.jpg), all knowing, all seeing and perfect overlord of Alpha Complex, you are male or female and feeling feelings that you haven't felt before and shouldn't be feeling now. Tell me what gender you have under that stylish jumpsuit you have and maybe a few kinks that are *Certainly* treasonous and we'll play a scene.\n\nThough this is set in an RPG universe it's ok if you don't know the rules, knowing the rules is treason after all.",

Who knows how to turn a woman into mush with his nimble fingers, skill full tongue, and horse-like cock. \n\nAlright.

He wouldn't have stuck his head around the shelves and saw two of Gryffindor's golden war heroes fucking like rabbits.\n\nDraco had stared, unable to move, as Weasley stood behind Granger.

Since when did the Mudblood grow all those curves.\n\nFor the next week, all he could think about was Granger. Granger, naked, bent over, getting fucked like a slut. He wanted to be Weasley. He wanted to take her.\n\nHe remembered what Potter and his friend had done in second year. They used Polyjuice Potion to impersonate his friends. Well, revenge was best served cold.\n\nSo Weasley was stunned and stuffed in a closet, and he was pretending to be the Gryffindor star. Granger was by his side, holding his hand, as they walked to the moonlit lake to have a quiet date night.\n\nMerlin, he was going to fuck her till she couldn't walk straight. \n\n**The Devil's Dilemma**\n\nHarry was beginning to spend a lot of time down by the Green Houses. It wasn't that he was good at Herbology. It was more that it was quiet and peaceful there. The plants swayed in the breeze, and Harry sat against one of the tall trees, working on his homework, trying to forgot about the war. He at least know enough about plants to avoid the dangerous ones. \n\nPansy Parkinson clearly didn't know that.\n\nShe had upset a pot of Devil's Snare and was now caught in its tendrils. It had pulled her tight, bent at the waist so that her hands and ankles were bound. It meant, as Harry walked in, he found himself facing her round bottom. Her skirt had ridden up and all that was between them was a pair of green panties. \n\nEmblazoned in silver writing across her curvy firm asscheeks were the words: spank for admittance. ",

My husband and take a little vacation to get out of the cold winter and head south to someplace nice and warm. During the day we spend our time lounging by the pool or swimming in the ocean. I have brought my favorite thong bikini because I know it makes Mike hard when I wear it in public. \n\nAfter dinner we decide to go to a local strip club. We walk in and there are half naked women everywhere, beautiful half naked women. This has to be one of the nicest strip clubs I have ever seen. We get a seat close to the stage and order some drinks. As usual, the strippers spend a lot of time near us and flirting with me. One even pulled my top up a bit and played with my boobs. I could tell that my husband really liked that. My tits out on display for everyone in the bar and another woman playing with them. \n\nAfter her performance she comes and asks us if we would like a private couples dance. We agree and follow her back to a quiet area of the club. Not exactly private, but not right in the middle of the action. First she starts with me, sitting on my lap and kissing me. Playing with my boobs again before she pulls my top all the way off. Her tits and mine pressed together feel so good. She reaches over and rubs Mike's crotch, her eyes widen with surprise as she can feel his 9\" cock in his shorts. She looks at me and winks before she unbuttons his shorts and takes out his dick. Sitting on my lap with her boobs in my face, she strokes his cock. Then she stands up and pulls me to my feet. She slides down my short skirt and exposes my shaved pussy and ass. I stand there naked as she kisses down my body to my wet pussy. She gives me a little lick before she turns to my husband. I watch as his dick disappears in her mouth. ",

            "selftext": "She showed up at your door two weeks ago -- your mom's younger sister, the flower child, the wild thing, \"that crazy hippie,\" as your dad has grunted on more than one occasion. Feet bare and dirty, ankles jingling merrily with bells on little bracelets; loosely flowing green skirt that, while hanging to her calves, was so shimmery and prone to moving about in a light breeze that you got more than one nice look at her upper thighs; a green velvet vest whose brass buttons strained with her generous cleavage, incidentally exposing the intricate Celtic knotwork tattoos of her upper arms; the silver mesh choker on her throat, dangling with astrological charms; and of course the feature that your mom was always clearly envious of: those wild red curls, Titian bright and gleaming like sunset, falling nearly to her waist.\n\nYour Aunt Kat. The wild thing. The irresponsible one. The one who gave you her extra ticket to Burning Man when her date cancelled on her, telling you she'd love to drive you there, but you had to be ok with her not going over the limit, because her license had been revoked for some stupid reason or another. \"Just the man keeping me down, y'know,\" she giggled, her jade eyes gleaming with mischief. You swallowed hard at the idea of spending three hours in the car with her, then sharing a hotel room overnight. (Or, more likely, a tent on the edge of the woods.) But your dad vetoed the trip. You don't think he'd do it again now that you're in college, but who knows?\n\nYou don't know how long she's planning to stay -- she was characteristically vague on why she showed up at your place, a quiet house somewhere between the suburbs and the north woods -- but your mom has always been determined to watch out for her baby sister when she can, and so she's overruled your dad's edict that she be gone within a month, or at least she get a regular job by then. She promised to earn her keep, though, and to be fair, she does seem to bring in money regularly enough. You know she earns a little money blogging for one of those nutty environmental websites, but you suspect she's supplementing her income with more-than-occasional pot deals. You've recognized the odor drifting from the guest room more than once, and of course there was that time at your 16th birthday where she offered to roll you a joint -- her jade eyes dancing with that same mischief as she purred she'd be happy to share one with you if you couldn't handle it.\n\nYour dad's not happy, but at least she's not a slob -- in fact, she cleaned out the cellar you were supposed to clean out when classes let out, and the dishes and laundry are all being done regularly, even if she does complain about not having local soaps or detergents. You blushed when a pair of her underwear somehow wound up in your clothing -- a practically transparent silvery-mesh g-string.\n\nShe's been acting odd, though. (Odder than usual, even.) She sleeps very late, and you hear music and sometimes muffled phone conversations drifting from her cellar bedroom long into the night, almost until dawn. Despite her longstanding vegetarian diet, you've caught her sneaking meat out of the fridge more than once -- and not cooking a burger or enjoying a few slices of bacon with breakfast, but popping raw ground beef or bits of chicken cutlet into her mouth with obvious relish, her green eyes glittering in the dark kitchen, reflecting what light there is.\n\nAnd there was the time you were coming home late from a friend's birthday party, just past midnight, and you saw the narrow cellar window that opens onto the woods behind the house fall open -- and your Aunt Kat slip out of it, completely naked, showing off gleaming tattoos on her pale body that you never imagined, her lustrous red hair glowing in the moonlight, prowling off in the direction of the woods on all fours, her sleek round ass swaying seductively. It was all you could do not to call out to her ... but something about her looked unnerving. Dangerous, even.\n\nYou remember when she first showed up, your mom commenting on a bandage on her left calf. She'd waved one be-ringed hand dismissively. \"Oh, I got a nip from a fox when I was out camping last week. Nothing serious.\"\n\nYou wonder if maybe it's time to get to know your Aunt Kat a little better ... if not for the free weed, then at least to see what's the matter with her.\n\nAnd to see just where that mischief in her eyes leads.",

The desire for sexual stimulation is nearly overwhelming.\n\nDespite my natural tendency to be harsh and aggressive, you've trained me remarkably well. You caught me less than a year ago, and since then, I've bonded tightly with you. When not in combat, I'm actually [*happy.*](https://static1.e621.net/data/64/a2/64a2f4eabf4e6be5bd20e487aadc28d0.gif) This is new for me. Before I met you, the most positive emotions I was able to feel were things like satisfaction, security, relief... Joy is novel to me, and I can't thank you enough for introducing me to it.\n\nBut, as of a week ago, I've been painfully reminded of my life before, and what that felt like. Instinct motivating my actions, a life driven exclusively by feral needs. I've gone into heat. I've become unruly, disobedient, irritable, and intensely aggressive once more. *I hate it.* I would take care of it myself if it weren't for the [foot-long knives I have for claws.](https://orig00.deviantart.net/2f30/f/2016/200/6/c/zangoose__nothin__but_claws_by_blueharuka-daamdxl.png)\n\nToday, I lost control. We were in the middle of a trainer battle, and I just snapped. I seriously injured the opponent's seviper, far more than was necessary for victory. The injuries were severe enough that a visit to a poke-center wouldn't be sufficient, and a trip to a hospital was required. You were banned from the league for a week on the grounds that you were unable to control a member of your team. If that hadn't been enough of a clue that something was wrong, then the flying, snarling, yowling leap I made towards you just as you were putting me back in my ball was a dead giveaway.\n\nWhen you get back to the hotel room you're staying in, you take a deep breath, and get ready to open my ball. You're nervous, images of my rage flashing through your mind, but you're a determined young man, and you can always find the courage to do what needs to be done. As soon as I'm out, I'm pacing back and forth in front of you on all fours. My hackles are raised, fangs are bared, and my eyes are filled with anger. But as perceptive as you are, and as well as you know me, you immediately look past all that and see the tears of frustration welling up in my eyes. I need your help.\n\n---\n\nHey there! Thanks for reading!\n\nSo, let me summarize. I'll be playing as a female zangoose who has just recently gone into heat. It's unbearably intense, with uncontrollable need, overwhelming aggressiveness and irritability, and even physical pain in the form of cramps and aches. As over-the-top as this is, my recent behavior has gotten us in trouble and even begun to frighten you, my trainer. You know something is wrong, you're just not sure what it is. But you're determined to get to the bottom of it and find a solution.\n\nI imagine that, when you do figure out what's going on, you'll be shocked, or at least embarrassed. I imagine that you'd also be reluctant to help me yourself... There is, after all, quite a taboo against trainer/pokemon sex.\n\nThere are a few ways this could go. One is that, after you overcome your reluctance, we get right to the banging. Another route we could go would be for you to take a few smaller steps first, like fingering, as a way of building up the courage to go further. Finally, there's the option of you being so nervous and/or uncomfortable that you aren't really willing to take charge, so instead, you invite me to take the lead so that I can \"take care of myself.\"\n\nKinks: pokephilia, size difference, heat, reluctance, anal, taboo\n\nLimits: bathroom, vomit, blood, etc.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if you'd like, pick up where I left off! Looking forward to hearing from you all!",

Hana Song, mech pilot extraordinaire and total babe, finally gets to join Overwatch! Her expertise in the Omnic Uprising has finally been recognized! However, there's quite a long list of things that need to be done before she's an official member. There's the physical, the aptitude test, training and protocol drills. Oh, and she has to take care of the needs of the futa members of the team: Tracer, Mei, Mercy, and new recruits Zarya and Pharah! What's a dorito-munching femboi to do?!\n\nAlternative scenario (or something that might happen in the same RP, much later): D.Va's mech is taken down by Talon. She's quite the asset, and Talon is very good at using ASSets. Too moral to join Talon, obviously, it's up to Widowmaker, Sombra, and Moira to reprogram the hero.\n\nKinks: Futa, Anal, Rimming, Ahegao, Gangbangs, Cumplay, BDSM and more.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone to act as a GM/narrator for a particular rp, basically you just have to play everyone I come across instead of one particular character. There's really not too much world building or a plot or anything like that, so it should be pretty easy even if you've never done anything similar before. The premise of the roleplay is very simple: I'm a young peasant girl with no family. One day, on my way home from town, I find an abandoned cart on the side of the road. It's been mostly looted, and everything except a small vial of glowing potion is gone. I take the potion and, after a few hours of contemplation, I drink it. However, all the potion does is make it so that I have to obey all requests or commands like it was nothing. This could go in a lot of different ways. Since it's in a fantasy medieval setting, more magic can be involved and mythical monsters, beasts and humanoids can also be involved. Some of my favorite kinks are: humiliation, degradation, transformation, toys, large insertions, beast, monster, nonhuman, hypnosis, messiness/sloppiness, body fluids, outfits, public, pet play, tattoos, abuse and brandings. Message me if you'd like to play!",

But I beg to disagree. I intend on showing everyone that I'm still perfectly capable of being the neighbourhood slut, and fulfilling the fantasies of young men. \n\nI'm 42 now, and have evolved into sort of a perfect bimbo. My tits are huge and real, always shown off in the tight tops I wear. My ass is the best part of me, thick and matched with my wide hips, ready to provide a meal to anyone who wants to put their face between my cheeks and lick it, or ready to be pounded to my heart's content. I have long silvery blonde hair, blue eyes, and pale white skin. \n\nMothers tell their sons (18+ please!) to stay away from me because of the reputation I've developed. But why would you follow your mother's advice and turn down such a nice big booty just for you?\n\nWhen it comes to my kinks, I really love cock. Slobbering all over it, licking it, kissing it, worshipping it.... Especially a big cock. I love to be called dirty and passionate names by a younger man. I love to seduce them into fucking me and taking control. I love men who make use of my ass - pounding me from behind like the buttslut I am, or just licking my asshole. I like to be humiliated a bit, telling me what a naughty whore I am as you rub your cock in my face and make me lick your nuts or ass. I like my makeup to be smeared, and to leave lipstick marks all over your cock and chest. \n\nYou can be whoever you want, as long as you provide me with some thick young dick... just a neighbourhood kid trying me out for the first time, or maybe you're one of my favourites who visits me every day. \n\nFinally, if you want to make me REALLY happy... You get a much higher chance of reply if you write well, if you let me lick your ass, and if you're willing to play as two men (I really like DP). \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "It's been just over a year since the big nighthowler scare. The mere concept was terrifying; the idea that any predator, at any time, potentially unprovoked, could go savage... There are a lot of terrible ways to go. Car accident, gas leak, hell, even being shot. But is there anything more horrifying than the thought of being viciously torn apart and eaten alive by someone who, only moments ago, was perfectly sane? It sounds like something out of a horror flick, and suddenly, it was reality. You weren't scared though. You looked at the numbers, read the news with a careful eye, and could see plain as day that these cases were incredibly rare, and although they were frightening, the odds of you ever ending up in a situation like that were remote, at the very least.\n\nAnd suddenly, the situation became *personal.* No, you weren't a victim. But the illusion that it could never happen to *you* was shattered when I, the secretary at your office, your own coworker, went missing. [I mean, I'm a tigress, but I'd always been friendly with you.](https://static1.e621.net/data/b8/27/b827bac372c2b914a857ca3e77818536.png) Although we didn't really know each other all that well, you knew me well enough to know that I was happy, calm, peaceful, gentle, kind... And then I didn't show up to work on a Tuesday. And I was still missing on Wednesday. And on Thursday, footage of me brutally mauling an innocent, defenseless goat flashed onto your TV screen. The poor man survived, but was in critical condition. I was in captivity, pacing back and forth, clearly insane.\n\nWhen the truth came out, the relief was incredible... But the aftershocks were definitely still being felt. There was still tension. And in the office, when I returned to work after a month of rehab, the tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. My first day back, I was excited to be around familiar faces again. The second day, I was a bit more subdued. By the end of the week, the light had left my eyes, my smile was always forced, and I always left the office with my eyes low and shoulders hunched. It felt like no one could see me anymore. They just saw that clip of the monster from TV, face smeared with blood.\n\nAnd then, a week later, you proved yourself a saint. I used to head to the break room at around lunchtime, happy to chat with whoever happened to be there while I ate. Over the past two weeks, I'd started eating at my desk instead; I couldn't bear the uncomfortable silence or the furtive glances. That day was no different. But, to my total shock, just as I'd pulled my raw steak out of my lunchbox, you teetered over to me on weak, frightened ankles, sat down at my desk, and started in on your crudites. You couldn't even look at me, and I could smell the fear wafting off of you in waves, but you stayed with me through the whole meal. We ate in silence, but more than once, out of the corner of your eye, you caught sight of me dabbing happy tears from my eyes with my napkin. Just as you stood up to head back to your desk, I reached out towards you, but stopped myself when you flinched away. I pulled back, folded my hands on the desk, and with a sappy, teary smile, just whispered a soft word of thanks.\n\nOver the next month or so, you kept coming over to my desk during lunch, and we got more and more comfortable with each other. The rest of the office saw what was happening, and slowly but surely, the tension started to go slack. Things won't ever be the way they were before, but thanks to your courage and kindness, everyone actually looked me in the eyes when they spoke to me, no one actively avoided me any longer, and I didn't have to force my smile anymore.\n\n---\n\nNow that all that time has passed, my confidence has returned in spades. Maybe we're not *close* friends, but out of anyone in the office, you're the one I'm closest with. There are times when you catch me smiling over at you from my desk. Each Monday morning, I bring in a box of donuts, half with protein supplements for me, and half made entirely vegan for you. I even remembered your birthday, and brought in a lovely, carmine-colored tie for you.\n\nIt's been good for you to see me relearning to trust and love myself for who I am. Before the incident, I always wore autumn colors and the occasional pastel. Nothing flashy. Now, I'm wearing much of the same, but you can see that I've taken a liking to the striking color red; tear-drop ruby earrings, crimson arm bands, bright red claw-polish, deep-rose lip gloss, even a tiny, cardinal nose ring... Some days, I even come in with some of my black stripes dyed maroon. But the most noticeable addition to my wardrobe is the brilliant, scarlet scarf that I wear every day, regardless of the weather. It's like it's a symbol for how proud I am of who I am, regardless of what anyone else thinks of me.\n\nThe news still occasionally runs stories about the nighthowler scare, things like updates on recovering victims, interviews with some of the predators that went savage, and so on. There's admittedly a little bit of a sensational spin on it all, of course. What could you expect? Sometimes it's just ridiculous. I mean, just this morning, an entire segment of your favorite morning news show was dedicated to some wack job yammering on about some new, risque, underground culture of \"pred/prey enthusiasts.\" He even brought on his own, stupid looking [infographic](https://static1.e621.net/data/bb/d3/bbd3bea1109c8974f9eb28fd079d1527.png). They showed it on the screen over and over and *over,* like they were desperate for you to recognize--\n\nWait.\n\n*Wait.*\n\n***What the fuck.***\n\nYou pause your DVR with the image still on screen. You almost can't believe that you're even paying it any attention, but you read the entire thing.\n\nAnd your stomach flips in your gut.\n\nThe earrings. The claw polish. The arm band, which I *always* wear just above the elbow. The damn lip gloss. The nose ring (I never *seemed* like the kind of person to go for a nose piercing)... The way I intentionally blot out the *black* of my stripes with *red*. **The fucking scarf.**\n\nAnd the red tie I gave you, the one you haven't gotten around to trying on just yet. Oh, *FUCK.* And the donuts. And the looks from across the office, which now that you think about it, are perhaps a bit more intense than you'd really let yourself think.\n\nThe more you think about it, the more irrefutable the evidence becomes. No, no, there's no chance in hell that I'd gone savage all on my own. The shame you'd seen in me made it clear that I was the victim there. But... Maybe something was left over from all that after all. Maybe... Maybe that's part of where my shame was coming from. Maybe the incident flipped some switch that no amount of therapy and rehabilitation can undo. And maybe this is my way of earning back my confidence, of learning to love myself again. Maybe I've embraced that part of me and found a *'healthy'* way to cope with it. And maybe...\n\nNo, there's no maybe on this last thought. There's not a shadow of a doubt that *I'm hungry for you.*\n\n---\n---\n\nHey there! If you managed to read all of that, then let me just say, *thank you.* That's some impressive dedication right there.\n\nSo, in case it isn't obvious, I'm looking for a Zootopia inspired roleplay here. Let me go ahead and summarize the premise, just to make sure that it's clear. I will be playing as Anjali, the tigress secretary in the office you work in. During the events of the movie, I was one of the preds that was hit with nighthowler, and went savage. After the events of the movie, when things were returning to normal, I returned to work, only to be ostracized as a monster. You (a prey species that I left vague so that you could choose what to play) worked up the courage to treat me like a person, rather than a monster. We grew close because of that, and I'm immensely grateful. Now, a year later, I've pretty much recovered my confidence, and you've noticed me wearing all sorts of exciting red accessories that I never would have worn before. You assume it's just a confidence thing, until you see a news story about \"pred/prey enthusiasts,\" a new subculture of risque, kinky folk who love to toy with the differences between predators and prey in their private lives. To your surprise, I'm showing all the signs of being a very, very intense \"pred-dominant.\" And of course, I have my eyes set on you. I've been \"stalking my prey\" for quite some time now... Which, really, is just a P/p way of saying that I've been flirting. ;)\n\nLet me summarize even further.... I was nice. Then, I turned big scary. Then, I was nice again, but no one believed me. You saw I was nice, and showed everyone else I was nice! I liked that lots. I like you lots! But now, you see that secretly, I *like* being big scary! :0 And I wanna be big scary *with you!!* :O NOW WHAT?!\n\nSo, as for where the story could go from here, it's pretty much in your court. I'm not quite crazy enough to just pounce on you in the parking lot after work. But here are a few ideas for where you might take this with me. You could quite simply ask me about all the new accessories, and if they mean what you think they mean. You could wear your own signifier to work (like an ear or horn band, as a symbol of newness to the idea), which would get me as close to \"pouncing you in the parking lot\" as possible. Or, you could wear that tie to work, which might just spark conversation between us over lunch. After all... That's why I got it for you. ;)\n\nAnyway, if you want to know what my kinks are, you'll just have to look at what I'm wearing and match it up with that infographic. &lt;3 That wack job knew what he was talking about.\n\nLimits are pretty standard:vomit, bathroom, etc. The only one of the usual limits that I'm actually happy to include is going to be blood, in small quantities. It's not necessary, of course, but, well, I wear red lip gloss... *I'm a biter.* So if that interests you, then I'd love to play with it.\n\nHope to hear from you all! Just let me know what prey species you'd be interested in playing, your thoughts on where you'd like to begin, and any questions you might have!",

I'm still looking, but I can't promise I'll answer all of them.\n\nThis last Christmas was the first Christmas I've ever spent alone.\n\nI made this Reddit account quite a while ago. I used to live out the fantasy of being some ultra dominant MILF with a cold heart, but that's not me and it's not who I want to be. It's who my ex husband wanted me to be. Now I understand it is so much more important to be myself, which is something I'm finding exceedingly hard to do. I hardly feel as though I belong in my own body any longer.\n\nSo here I am online on a subreddit I haven't thought about in over a year, trying to reclaim some semblance of self by stimulating my mind with lewd, rude conversations and roleplay with strangers on the internet. This feels like a perverted rom-com with more porn and less rom-com.\n\nSo a bit about me. My name is Wanda, I'm 30 years old. I work as an editor for an advertising company and that's where I've been working since I left school. I'm 5'6, dirty blonde hair, 32B breasts, round butt, and I've got a slim frame. That's me.\n\nA thank you to all those who read this, and even more thanks to all those who reply.",

I woke up in a world far different than the one I was expecting. I was hot! Long blond hair flowed down my thin back to my newly plumped ass. My waist was super tiny. And my boobs... I mean, I had always wanted big boobs. But, these were kind of ridiculous. As I layer down, they seemed to take up my entire torso!\n\nMy room seemed to reflect my new life. My hamper was filled with bras that could hold a small toddler. I had a lot more tank tops and low-cutting shirts than I remember.\n\nSitting on my nightstand was a picture of me and my two friends swimming last summer: Emily and Mark. Emily is the only girl that could ever make me feel small. Every couple months, we would alternate off who had the largest boobs. Right now, it\u2019s her turn. She shows them off more than I do though. That picture was the first time I tried wearing a two-piece bikini. I looked pretty obscene. Mark was with us too. He\u2019s an objectively good looking guy. And every picture of him seems to emphasize the bulge in his pants. I\u2019ve never seen it in real life, but it must be enormous.\n\nBut, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Yesterday, they were my unremarkable best friends that I would watch movies with.\n\nIt\u2019s weird. I remember this world where I\u2019m this unremarkable nobody. And then I remember this world where I grew up as a hot, busty girl with hot friends. I didn\u2019t have an Instagram in my old life. I\u2019ve got 50k followers now and a subreddit full of guys lusting over me in my new life.\n\nI was thinking one of you could play either Emily or Mark.\n\n(All characters are above the age of 18)",

            "selftext": "Welcome to a world where some of the women are a bit more... exotic. Some women have been blessed to be forever young and flirty, picking out whichever studs are lucky enough to come across them. Others are sexy as fuck, aggressively slutty, and very very seductive. So which do you have the (mis)fortune of running into today? Let's find out!\n\n1. Succubus/Cum Vampire: They've managed to blend in and integrate into society far too well. Usually older, MILFy women, cursed to never age. They're gifted with the plumpest, most perfect assets... usually a huge pair of tits and juicy white ass. Combined with their bright seductive green eyes, no man can escape them when they're in the mood for feeding. They can usually be working at schools, bars, offices, universities... anywhere that ensures a nice steady flow of young men to seduce and drain of their cum. Easily identifiable by their skimpy and tight clothing, no matter the profession!\n\n2. PAEG (Phat Ass Elven Girl): Pale skinned, light haired girls usually in their early 20s and full of energy. Some come complete with exotic little elf ears, but not all. For some reason, fucking humans gives them a thrill beyond anything else! They're constantly bragging to eachother about how many human guys they managed to seduce that day, and how many guys loved their perfect little asses. Seducing fit hung guys is just a fun pastime for them, and they love every second of it. They can usually be found at gyms, the beach, pools... anywhere where they can proudly show off their bodies in skimpy outfits.\n\n3. Wood Nymph: Like the elven girls, but found deep in nature. They're so rare they're considered a thing of fiction. They so rarely encounter humans in the wilderness, that when they do, they tend to keep him for a while. Getting the most out of him before they set him free. \n\nSo who are you, and who do you want to encounter? Where do you encounter them? Reference pics are welcome, if you have any intended look for any of them! \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHope you enjoyed! We can flesh this out however you want, a lot of the details are completely up to you. Or if you want you can just set a scene and we can get going!\n",

            "selftext": "\n\n\nHey everyone! \n\nAre you a fan of anime doujinishi? (Specifically rule-34-like parodies?)\n\nLove watching your favorite characters getting fucked stupid until they're completely mindbroken, either out of passion or desperation? \n\nCovered in cum, filled to the brim with seed, splashed with bodily fluids until they're a shell of their former selves?\n\nIf you're like me, then you said yes to all those questions, and that means: **You've come to the right place!**\n\nChoose one of these lovely girls from any of the following anime, or suggest your own (as a disclaimer, I'll have final say on who I play.)\n\n* Soul Eater: Maka, Patty, Liz, Tsubaki, Blair, Medusa\n\n* Little Witch Academia: Sucy, Akko, Lotte, Diana\n\n* Fullmetal Alchemist: Riza, Lust, Winry, General Armstrong\n\n* Kill La Kill: Ryuko, Satsuki, Mako, Nonon, Sukuyo, Nui Harime, Ragyo, Rei\n\n* Watamote: Tomoko\n\n* Akame Ga Kill: Akame, Kurome, Mine, Leone, Najenda, Esdeath, Chelsea\n\n* Panty and Stocking: Panty Anarchy, Stocking Anarchy\n\n* Infinite Stratos: Houki, Cecilia, Huang, Charlotte, Laura\n\n* Sword Art Online: Asuna, Leafa, Sinon, Silica, Lisbeth\n\n* Fairy Tail: Lucy, Erza, Juvia, Mirajane, Lisanna, Cana, Levy\n\n* My Hero Academia: Ochako, Tsuyu, Momo, Mina, Toru, Kyoka\n\n* Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: Tohru, Kobayashi, Lucoa\n\n* Konosuba: Aqua, Megumin, Darkness\n\nAs for kinks, the biggest ones I'd like to work into this are the following: ahegao, **dirty talk (especially if it's really cheesy-sounding doujin dirty talk!),** mind break, corruption, fucked silly, cumplay, anal, double penetration, gang bang, costumes, bukkake, etc.\n\nNot all of those are required, but those are my favorites! We don't need more than one person fucking her either, I'm just a fan of gangbangs.\n\nWe can play characters in-universe, or perhaps you fall into my world / I fall into yours. Maybe I'm a cosplayer, who just looks identical to her character.\n\nThe only caveat is that there is no blood, gore, or death allowed. Anything else is fair game\n\n(As a note all characters are considered 18+ for RP purposes.)\n\nI don't mind playing with anyone regardless of gender, so guys, girls, and anything in between, hit me up! I'm sure we'll have some fun!",

Getting to know one another, hit it off, see where it goes. I love talking music, movies, pop culture, comics ... try me, let's see what we can get into. :)\n\nA little about me: 26 F from the east coast. I guess you could say indie/alternative. Short, black hair (often with a highlight of color), a few tattoos (ask away :) ), black frame glasses, full lips. Slim pear-shaped, full chest, curvy hips. Petite but filled out. \n\nI love reading, love horror movies. Always down for a beer and an intimate chat. :) I'm an open book, let's get to know one another. ",

            "selftext": "Ever since we joined the Confederation, us sergals have been the primary military force. It runs in our blood, runs in our genes, and provides the very foundation upon which our culture is built. Honor. Selflessness. Respect. Loyalty. These are the things we prize above all else.\n\nBut of them, loyalty is perhaps the most important. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts; when we come together, when we grow close and cooperate as one, we can achieve far more than we could were we working alone. The bonds formed between warriors are intensely powerful, and incredibly important to us. It is *this* that makes us such a potent force to be reckoned with, and why we stand as the backbone of the Confederate Fleet.\n\nOf course, it's not just sergals in the military. Anyone can enlist. It's simply that the majority of those who enlist are sergals, and more sergals make it through basic training through sheer force of will and dedication to brothers. But there are some that show just as much zeal, passion, and skill. I've learned not to judge anyone by their race. [I'm not a young man](https://static1.e621.net/data/db/2b/db2bd86719e19c58e37881906146c804.jpg), and I remember when we had to stand alone against the rest, so it's taken me a long time to come around, but I can see now that each species holds a unique value and importance... And also that individuals from each race need not be the same as the rest.\n\nAll the same, when I saw that a *you,* a *human recruit* had been taken on as an interceptor pilot on my ship, I was shocked... Or perhaps 'confused' is a better word. How could a human qualify for such a position? Don't get me wrong, humans are remarkable creatures; I've never seen such long-term endurance in an individual as is demonstrated by \"marathoners.\" That anyone would *choose* to run that far, for that long, is enough to make me short of breath. I would die of heatstroke halfway through. But being a fighter pilot isn't about endurance. It's about reaction times, visual acuity, and the like. Human eyes simply aren't as precise as a sergal's. Their reflexes aren't as instantaneous. Sure, a human could outlast me, but I could out-sprint and outmaneuver one any day. Or so I thought.\n\nI'm sure that if we were on foot and unarmed, you wouldn't stand a chance; you barely come up to my chest, after all. But after seeing you in action, after seeing what you're capable of in the cockpit, I discovered a new respect for you. I made sure to promote you to squadron leader as quickly as protocol allowed. You are genuinely remarkable.\n\nAnd now, now that I see you, now that you're at the top where you deserve to be, I need to reward you. I need to induct you into the ways we sergals maintain our performance and allegiance and loyalty. It's time I showed you what's been going on all around you all along, without you ever noticing.\n\nYou see, for thousands of years, we've known something that the rest of the galaxy doesn't. There is no better way to boost morale, no better way to cement loyalty, no better way to form the closest, most intense of bonds than to mate. Engaging in regular lovemaking with those you must depend upon and who depend upon you brings men closer than anything else can aside from the furnace of battle itself.\n\nI know that you are human, and that you don't share this cultural understanding with the rest of the crew. This is why it must be I that introduces you to this. You already trust me. I've shown that I trust you. We have both seen that the other is flawed and prone to error, and neither is afraid to respectfully point out the other's mistakes. We both see each other as men, not as mere subordinate and superior. We already have respect and loyalty for each other. So it must be I that takes you that one step further.\n\n---\n\nHey there! Thanks for reading!\n\nSo let me summarize. I'll be playing as Commander Daxin, a sergal member of the (almost entirely sergal) military. You are a human who gained my respect, and who has worked directly with me many times before. We have at least a respectful, even somewhat friendly and familiar relationship, despite our difference in rank. Now, I've decided that it's finally time that I introduced you to an ancient sergal military tradition; *fucking.*\n\nI imagine that you'll be shocked at first, but after remembering my wisdom and taking into account your trust in me, you'd be willing to at least try it. I feel like it would be fun if your character considered themselves straight, but was still willing to take my character as a mentor in this moment.\n\nWe'd start out surprisingly tenderly; this tradition isn't just about getting your rocks off, it's about forming lifelong bonds. It's meant to be very positive for both parties. Considering how much larger Daxin is than your character, this means plenty of patience, but that's part of the fun if you ask me. &lt;3\n\nKinks: interspecies, reluctance, nervousness, patience, tenderness, anal, size difference/size play, large penis, excessive cum\n\nLimits: blood, vomit, bathroom, etc.\n\nHope to hear from you all!",

Just as the title reads, I'm looking to find an older person to chat with!\n\nFirst a bit about me: I'm 22, just graduated University, Korean with dark hair that barely goes past my shoulders. I'm about 5'3 and wear glasses as well. I'd say I'm average or normal looking, or even boring, with a fairly shy personality.\n\n**What I like:**\n\n* Older men with no real maximum age in sight! If you're older than me, that's a huge plus for me. \n\n* Confidence! \n\n* Men who are a bit geeky or know their way around some video games. I play some PC games so if you do too then that's a huge plus! (Admittedly I'm not very good but I still like to talk about them :3)\n\n* Politeness. Trust me, I love absolutely degrading myself and a lot of rough ideas but if you can't be friendly or respectful outside of those moments then I'm not interested.\n\n**Kinks**\n\n* I'm very submissive and enjoy pet-play, collars and serving. If we write a story... part of the story will involve you giving me a nose ring and maybe a butt plug.\n\n* I have a very strong oral fetish, swallowing is great! Spit and watersports are extra great! (I have a scenario that involves me and entire swim team for this so if you enjoy group play this could work :3) I also like a lot of ass play.\n\n* **Breeding!** I like the idea of raceplay a little bit, but not too much. Knowing if you're White, Black, etc, would be a good thing! \n\n* I enjoy age play as well!\n\n* **Yiff and Furry play! I explain what I like about this in my other posts as well!**\n\n\n\n\nI'm looking for someone who can exchange a few messages a day, or maybe get into a chat room in the evening (that's when I get the most uninterrupted free time, a problem of living at home still). I also love to write roleplay, so if you love to write let me know!\n\nThanks for reading my post! ",

I'm happy to play as myself (overstacked 5'2\" half-Quebecois girl with a phenomenal booty), or any of a wide range of beauties you might want me to pretend to be.\n\nMy favourite kinks include: anal (I'm a little bit of a naughty buttslut. Toys, fingers, tongues, mmm), oral, cumplay/facials, dress-up/slutty clothing (having outfits picked out for me is a favourite - leashes and collars can be cute too), ageplay and sleazy older men (another favourite), interracial, dirty talking, degradation and titfucking.\n\nLimits tend to be around piss/scat/blood - I'm open to bestiality in the right context...\n\nScenewise, I tend to go towards simpler premises with creativity embedded in them. I'm au fait with all of the fantasy/sci-fi chique, but tend to prefer good, smutty real-world scenes. The usual classics;  **friend's father/brother, trucker/hitchhiker, coffee shop girl, tourist resort, work related (secretary or clothing store), babysitter, some incest scenes**.\n\nHappy to create together, but if you want the best response please hit me up with a detailed idea for a scene you would like to take forward! I'm quite picky and spelling/grammar, but please take the time to give me a little detail, tell me about your favourite kinks (and what you like), and give me something to go from and respond to!\n\nSend me lots of lovely, sexy visual cues and images.

I posted this yesterday and got flooded with responses, but only one that I really enjoyed... I'll try to get back to everyone, but using your imagination and putting a little effort in goes a long way.\n\n_____________\n\nSitting on your hotel bed you flip through picture after picture of cute, young, bikini-clad girls. You figured a family reunion in Hawaii would be the perfect time to download Tinder and innocently check out some beach babes. After a long day of family activities, while your wife showered, you got to swiping.\n\nAfter a couple minutes it almost starts to get boring, perfect body after perfect body swipes past, and you figure that you have no chance of matching with any of them. Thats when you see her. Your quick swiping comes to a halt as you do a double take. Is that. It can't be. It is.\n\nIt's your sister's daughter [Kylie](http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/repostr/5115820/1396786209/03_1_set0334.jpg). Freshly 18, and headed off for her freshman year of college in a couple months, she's staying just a couple hotel rooms away with your sister and her husband. Unable to contain your curiosity look at her profile. Her bio reads:\n\n*On a boring vacation with my family. Where my sexy island boys at? ;)*\n\nYou slide through her profile, from [picture](http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/repostr/5115820/624523315/03_1_set0303.jpg) to [picture](http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/repostr/5115820/1786758249/03_2_set03066.jpg), unable to help yourself, then freeze as you're about to swipe left and be done with it. You can't make yourself do it. You lock your phone and look up at your wife.\n\n\"ready for bed?\" She asks.\n\n\"Sure\" You mumble. You get up to get ready for bed, but can't help yourself. Unlocking your phone and re-opening Tinder you quickly swipe right on your niece's profile and lock your phone again.\n\nWaking up the next morning, you roll over and glance at your phone. A notification reads:\n\n*It's a match*\n\nOpening tinder you immediately see your niece's devilish smiling face. Holy shit. You frantically start trying to find where to delete your account and pretend like this never happened, but again you're stopped in your tracks when you see the stupid message that Tinder displays under the match.\n\n*Well you've come this far. You might as well say something.*\n________________\nKinks include, but aren't limited to: Cheating, risky sex, oral, anal, big dicks, lots of cum, ANAL, slutty outfits...\n\nLimits: Scat, gore, snuff, hardcore bdsm",

Oh yeah... fucking take it you slut...*\"\n\n\"Danny, just shut the fuck up and just get the job done\"\n\n\"*I can't help it... you're so tight*\"\n\n\"I work here idiot, there's a lot of books on this shit\"\n\n\"*Oh fuck me, I'm gonna cum*\"\n\n\"Don't you fucking dare!\"\n\nInstinctively, and rather stupidly, I clench down on the cock ramming in and out of my pussy, in an effort to try and keep it inside me. Of course, I realise my mistake immediately, but by then it's too late, the throbbing meat slips from inside me and twitches as it spurts ropes of warm, gooey cum down my thighs as muffled grunts seep through the wall.\n\n\"God fucking damnit, have you never heard of gloryhole etiquette?\"\n\n\"*Not my fault you're so tight, finish yourself off*\"\n\n\"Get the fuck out before I revoke your card, we are *never* fucking again\"\n\nThe familiar clang of belt buckle against wooden wall reverberates around the tiny room, followed by the hurried shuffle of feet and the creak of the booth door next to mine. I sigh a little, reaching down to the dripping mess on my thighs, scooping up a finger's worth and bringing it to my mouth. I'm never fucking him again... but a blowjob's not out of the question.\n\nI sigh again before cleaning myself and the floor up, finally pulling up my pants and tucking in the scratchy black t-shirt with the adult store's name emblazoned on the front. ***Hell***. Acknowledging the irony I felt in that name had got old after the first year, so I just raise an eyebrow at my reflection in the shiny tissue dispenser, tussle my hair a little into something other than a complete mess, and stride out of the booth, through the heavy black door back into the main store.\n\n*Ding-Dong*\n\n\"Hi there, welcome to Hell. Anything I can help with?\"\n\n---\n\nHey there, Alex Here,\n\nBringing back one of the old favourites, see if I can get some fun out of her :D One or two small edits have occurred but they're tiny so it's pretty much the original.\n\nSo, quick recap. I am Alex, and I work in Hell. Hell is a sex shop, with a back room with some porn and some holes in the walls. I sometimes dip back there, though mostly everyone is an asshat. Fairly simple premise but I thought we might be able to throw something fun in it's direction, think Clerks but surrounded by dildos.\n\nGo ahead and check my DPP profile for kinklist and description, let's have some fun!\n\nAlex\n\nXx\n\n",

In this role play. \n\nThe premise is pretty straight forward, I find a way to grow and enlarge your cock through a special serum/pills.

Do you want me to be your older sister, or mother?\n4.  What should I look like? (Photos are ideal)\n2.  How big do you want your cock to get?\n2.  How big would your loads be?\n2.

I would be aiming to emulate the universes of things such as Bladerunner, Deus Ex or Ghost in the Shell but if you have other suggestions I'd love to hear them! OC is something I will almost always be interested in! There is a large number of ways that this can be taken so please suggest other prompts if none of the below fit you!\n\n* A girl begs for enhancements that will greatly benefit her career, be that athletically or mentally. However, she lacks money and the two of us need to come to an agreement on how you will be paid..\n\n* A female vigilante has been roaming the streets and disturbing the many cyber gangs of the city. You, a mercenary or bounty hunter have been hired to put a stop to her. How do you go about doing that? Maybe she is just too beautiful to put down?\n\n* You have captured a girl to experiment with new augmentations and enhancements, much to her displeasure. What do you experiment on her? Super soldier or super slut?\n\nThat's all my ideas for now but again feel free to suggest any idea you might have! My only real requirement for a partner here is be a decent writer and to have detail in your responses. Long-term prompts are prefered.\n\nAs for kinks and limits, I am pretty open to almost anything, my only real consistent kink is domination so please come at me with your ideas! Also don't just jump right into it! I like to set the scene and decide what we both want first.\n\nI'll be waiting.\n",

Then we'll meet up and get down to it. \n\nI'm open to a lot of different ways this could go. I'm not a huge fan of massive dicks or anything, so no need to have a monster in your pants.

As she did, another dancer stumbled into her, their hands landing on her hips. She looked between the two of them, now stuck between them, body pressed up against theirs. They both wore matching grins, an expression that, looking around, a large number of the party patrons surrounding her also wore. \n\n***\n\nHi there! I'm looking for someone to help me with this; a girl goes to a party arranged by her friends, and while dancing, things get slightly more intense than she was intending. Not that she's complaining! I'm looking for this to end up with her either on her knees, surrounded by her friends that she has to go down on, or with her bound in the middle of the room for people to come and use as the night goes on. Maybe the host has some toys that they're letting people use; I'd love to ride a sybian whilst putting my mouth to good use! \n\nMy kinklist can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/GIHSeVm.png), but for this prompt in particular I'd like to include oral, cumplay, dp, name calling, and potentially bondage and gags. \n\nPlease note that if this prompt is up then I'm still open for responses!

            "selftext": "It's been just over a year since the big nighthowler scare. The mere concept was terrifying; the idea that any predator, at any time, potentially unprovoked, could go savage... There are a lot of terrible ways to go. Car accident, gas leak, hell, even being shot. But is there anything more horrifying than the thought of being viciously torn apart and eaten alive by someone who, only moments ago, was perfectly sane? It sounds like something out of a horror flick, and suddenly, it was reality. You weren't scared though. You looked at the numbers, read the news with a careful eye, and could see plain as day that these cases were incredibly rare, and although they were frightening, the odds of you ever ending up in a situation like that were remote, at the very least.\n\nAnd suddenly, the situation became *personal.* No, you weren't a victim. But the illusion that it could never happen to *you* was shattered when I, the secretary at your office, your own coworker, went missing. [I mean, I'm a tigress, but I'd always been friendly with you.](https://static1.e621.net/data/b8/27/b827bac372c2b914a857ca3e77818536.png) Although we didn't really know each other all that well, you knew me well enough to know that I was happy, calm, peaceful, gentle, kind... And then I didn't show up to work on a Tuesday. And I was still missing on Wednesday. And on Thursday, footage of me brutally mauling an innocent, defenseless goat flashed onto your TV screen. The poor man survived, but was in critical condition. I was in captivity, pacing back and forth, clearly insane.\n\nWhen the truth came out, the relief was incredible... But the aftershocks were definitely still being felt. There was still tension. And in the office, when I returned to work after a month of rehab, the tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. My first day back, I was excited to be around familiar faces again. The second day, I was a bit more subdued. By the end of the week, the light had left my eyes, my smile was always forced, and I always left the office with my eyes low and shoulders hunched. It felt like no one could see me anymore. They just saw that clip of the monster from TV, face smeared with blood.\n\nAnd then, a week later, you proved yourself a saint. I used to head to the break room at around lunchtime, happy to chat with whoever happened to be there while I ate. Over the past two weeks, I'd started eating at my desk instead; I couldn't bear the uncomfortable silence or the furtive glances. That day was no different. But, to my total shock, just as I'd pulled my raw steak out of my lunchbox, you teetered over to me on weak, frightened ankles, sat down at my desk, and started in on your crudites. You couldn't even look at me, and I could smell the fear wafting off of you in waves, but you stayed with me through the whole meal. We ate in silence, but more than once, out of the corner of your eye, you caught sight of me dabbing happy tears from my eyes with my napkin. Just as you stood up to head back to your desk, I reached out towards you, but stopped myself when you flinched away. I pulled back, folded my hands on the desk, and with a sappy, teary smile, just whispered a soft word of thanks.\n\nOver the next month or so, you kept coming over to my desk during lunch, and we got more and more comfortable with each other. The rest of the office saw what was happening, and slowly but surely, the tension started to go slack. Things won't ever be the way they were before, but thanks to your courage and kindness, everyone actually looked me in the eyes when they spoke to me, no one actively avoided me any longer, and I didn't have to force my smile anymore.\n\n---\n\nNow that all that time has passed, my confidence has returned in spades. Maybe we're not *close* friends, but out of anyone in the office, you're the one I'm closest with. There are times when you catch me smiling over at you from my desk. Each Monday morning, I bring in a box of donuts, half with protein supplements for me, and half made entirely vegan for you. I even remembered your birthday, and brought in a lovely, carmine-colored tie for you.\n\nIt's been good for you to see me relearning to trust and love myself for who I am. Before the incident, I always wore autumn colors and the occasional pastel. Nothing flashy. Now, I'm wearing much of the same, but you can see that I've taken a liking to the striking color red; tear-drop ruby earrings, crimson arm bands, bright red claw-polish, deep-rose lip gloss, even a tiny, cardinal nose ring... Some days, I even come in with some of my black stripes dyed maroon. But the most noticeable addition to my wardrobe is the brilliant, scarlet scarf that I wear every day, regardless of the weather. It's like it's a symbol for how proud I am of who I am, regardless of what anyone else thinks of me.\n\nThe news still occasionally runs stories about the nighthowler scare, things like updates on recovering victims, interviews with some of the predators that went savage, and so on. There's admittedly a little bit of a sensational spin on it all, of course. What could you expect? Sometimes it's just ridiculous. I mean, just this morning, an entire segment of your favorite morning news show was dedicated to some wack job yammering on about some new, risque, underground culture of \"pred/prey enthusiasts.\" He even brought on his own, stupid looking [infographic](https://static1.e621.net/data/bb/d3/bbd3bea1109c8974f9eb28fd079d1527.png). They showed it on the screen over and over and *over,* like they were desperate for you to recognize--\n\nWait.\n\n*Wait.*\n\n***What the fuck.***\n\nYou pause your DVR with the image still on screen. You almost can't believe that you're even paying it any attention, but you read the entire thing.\n\nAnd your stomach flips in your gut.\n\nThe earrings. The claw polish. The arm band, which I *always* wear just above the elbow. The damn lip gloss. The nose ring (I never *seemed* like the kind of person to go for a nose piercing)... The way I intentionally blot out the *black* of my stripes with *red*. **The fucking scarf.**\n\nAnd the red tie I gave you, the one you haven't gotten around to trying on just yet. Oh, *FUCK.* And the donuts. And the looks from across the office, which now that you think about it, are perhaps a bit more intense than you'd really let yourself think.\n\nThe more you think about it, the more irrefutable the evidence becomes. No, no, there's no chance in hell that I'd gone savage all on my own. The shame you'd seen in me made it clear that I was the victim there. But... Maybe something was left over from all that after all. Maybe... Maybe that's part of where my shame was coming from. Maybe the incident flipped some switch that no amount of therapy and rehabilitation can undo. And maybe this is my way of earning back my confidence, of learning to love myself again. Maybe I've embraced that part of me and found a *'healthy'* way to cope with it. And maybe...\n\nNo, there's no maybe on this last thought. There's not a shadow of a doubt that *I'm hungry for you.*\n\n---\n---\n\nHey there! If you managed to read all of that, then let me just say, *thank you.* That's some impressive dedication right there.\n\nSo, in case it isn't obvious, I'm looking for a Zootopia inspired roleplay here. Let me go ahead and summarize the premise, just to make sure that it's clear. I will be playing as Anjali, the tigress secretary in the office you work in. During the events of the movie, I was one of the preds that was hit with nighthowler, and went savage. After the events of the movie, when things were returning to normal, I returned to work, only to be ostracized as a monster. You (a prey species that I left vague so that you could choose what to play) worked up the courage to treat me like a person, rather than a monster. We grew close because of that, and I'm immensely grateful. Now, a year later, I've pretty much recovered my confidence, and you've noticed me wearing all sorts of exciting red accessories that I never would have worn before. You assume it's just a confidence thing, until you see a news story about \"pred/prey enthusiasts,\" a new subculture of risque, kinky folk who love to toy with the differences between predators and prey in their private lives. To your surprise, I'm showing all the signs of being a very, very intense \"pred-dominant.\" And of course, I have my eyes set on you. I've been \"stalking my prey\" for quite some time now... Which, really, is just a P/p way of saying that I've been flirting. ;)\n\nLet me summarize even further.... I was nice. Then, I turned big scary. Then, I was nice again, but no one believed me. You saw I was nice, and showed everyone else I was nice! I liked that lots. I like you lots! But now, you see that secretly, I *like* being big scary! :0 And I wanna be big scary *with you!!* :O NOW WHAT?!\n\nSo, as for where the story could go from here, it's pretty much in your court. I'm not quite crazy enough to just pounce on you in the parking lot after work. But here are a few ideas for where you might take this with me. You could quite simply ask me about all the new accessories, and if they mean what you think they mean. You could wear your own signifier to work (like an ear or horn band, as a symbol of newness to the idea), which would get me as close to \"pouncing you in the parking lot\" as possible. Or, you could wear that tie to work, which might just spark conversation between us over lunch. After all... That's why I got it for you. ;)\n\nAnyway, if you want to know what my kinks are, you'll just have to look at what I'm wearing and match it up with that infographic. &lt;3 That wack job knew what he was talking about.\n\nLimits are pretty standard:vomit, bathroom, etc. The only one of the usual limits that I'm actually happy to include is going to be blood, in small quantities. It's not necessary, of course, but, well, I wear red lip gloss... *I'm a biter.* So if that interests you, then I'd love to play with it.\n\nHope to hear from you all! And of course, if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask!",

A blowjob is such a selfless and intimate act that requires a steadfast devotion and dedication to the man's pleasure. It means sometimes kneeling in an uncomfortable position or on a hard surface, or using every once of dedication in my soul to continue bobbing despite a cramping jaw or my own fatigue.\n\nI adore the beauty of giving a man this type of pleasure. That beautiful first glance as I get down or take his cock out, that says\"Oh God, is she about to...\" or the tender caress of his fingers across my soft face and through my hair, which send such a beautiful signal of his love and appreciation for what I do from him. \n\nI love sucking. Wrapping my tongue skilfully around the head and ridge, coating in in the flowing trickles of warm saliva, taking him into my mouth and pressing him against the soft silky warmth of my tongue and the wet rigid texture of the roof of my mouth.\n\nArt is about passion Passion is about doing what you love.\n\nPrivate message me if you'd like to roleplay a blowjob scene. :)",

It's been a while. Maybe they just lost a connection.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey ghosted you. Could be a good link you've had for 2 days. Or a woman you've sexted for two months. Maybe someone you spent a year talking to.\n\nIt's happened to me. All of it.\n\nNow I'm a little bit more guarded but my desire to be social. My desire to break the bonds of my introvert behaviour and seek another woman are there. Maybe I'm just a slave to my hormones. But I still believe there is a woman maybe a few women out there that can pique my \"atypical guy\" interest.\n\nI don't know what else to say except my heart is broken. I believe too easy, trust too much and worst of all? I'm at it again. Maybe to get bruised emotionally. Maybe to find another woman that clicks on an intellectual and sexual live again.\n\nMaybe I've been searching the wrong places. Let's try this again. Send me a message if you want to give it a try.\n\nIf you actually read this message (as so few do), include your favourite beverage in the message.",

I'm pretty open when it comes to ideas and would love people to suggest things as I love being surprised but I'll but a few here in case anyone has no ideas. While these are just general fantasy prompts I am totally open to sci-fi RP as well, as long as it is not boring old reality I'm happy.\n\n* A vampire gains a new thrall and has to train them, how that happens can be entire up to you! Be as cruel or kind as you like.\n\n* A bounty hunter captures their target and has to travel far with them to collect their reward. What will they get up to on the way there?\n\n* A prince/princess barely escapes an overthrow of his kingdom with their most trusted guard, what do they do from there? Plot their revenge or lead a new life?\n\nThats all my ideas for now but again feel free to suggest any idea you might have! My only real requirement for a partner here is be a decent writer, I like detail in my stories. Long-term prompts are prefered.\n\nAs for kinks and limits I am pretty open to almost anything, my only real consistent kink is bondage so please come at me with your ideas!\n\nI'll be waiting.\n",

It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it\u2019s quiet and people don\u2019t usually bother me. Becky likes it because she can get all the books she wants.\n\nThings have been quite good since Virginia came to live with Becky, Lily and me. She makes sure I stay on schedule, and she takes the right meds for me to get to work. She said, \u201cMeredith, it\u2019s very important that you get to the Library every day and that you are there when the people from Social come by to check.\u201d Virginia is good and responsible like that. She keeps Dr. Powell calm and happy with my progress.\n\nIn fact, she keeps all of us out of trouble. Especially Lily, who has only snuck out clubbing twice since we got here. Lily used to do that all the time before the clinic, and would come home at all hours totally wasted. Becky hated that and would hide in her room until my head quit pounding. Lily said she didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nIt was that attitude that was the scary thing about Lily, because she had no compunction about what she popped in her mouth when she was out partying. And blacking out was a Bad Thing. Blacking out is what landed us at Seacliff for six months. \n\nSo, anyway, there\u2019s this one guy that keeps coming by the Library, and sometimes we talk. Yesterday, he asked if I wanted to get a cup of coffee with him on Saturday. Becky thinks he\u2019s nice, and Lily says he\u2019s hawt. Virginia thinks it might be too soon to be going on dates, but I feel like I\u2019ve got to at least try. I mean, otherwise I spend all my free time here in the apartment with the four of us.\n\nWell. Us and Julie. We don\u2019t talk about Julie.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nSo, it\u2019s a bit crowded in Meredith\u2019s head. But you shouldn\u2019t worry; I\u2019m sure the date will go just fine. Actually, I\u2019m not really sure where this will go, because who you get will depend on what you do\u2026\n\nI'm looking for a medium term RP with a beginning, middle and clear ending. I don't like pain, verbal viciousness, blood, torture, non-con, toilet stuff, and death. Other things not forbidden are negotiable in OOC discussion. Before we begin, introduce yourself and what you think your character is looking for. Let me know what your own limits are, and any special \u201cPlease, yes\u201d requests.\n\nAs in all my prompts, please remember, this is a character(s) I'm playing, not really me. Know the difference between \"in scene\" and \"not in scene\". Also, good grammar is important, sexy, and keeps Julie mollified.\n\nI'll try to reply to all polite responses, even if it's just a polite \"no thanks.\" \n\nMy older prompts can be found at [r/DeeDeeDPP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeeDeeDPP/)",

            "selftext": "The rolling crack of a dozen thunder-guns shakes the field, splitting the calm air that had formed and replacing it with the chaos of the battlefield. We six-hundred stand side by side, blades in hands and honour in hearts, readying ourselves for the coming slaughter. We are outnumbered sixty to one, five-hundred samurai faced by thirty-thousand soldiers of the new empire.\n\nI hold my naginata tightly in my gloved hands, palms already sweaty from the heat of the fields of [Shiroyama](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylyqoxh-cXk) and my own nervousness, further proven by my roaring heart rate. I close my eyes a moment and breathe deep, a moment's meditation washing away the terror I feel inside of me and replacing it with steely resolve. Aigo sees me and nods once respectfully; I am the only woman amongst our number, but I have earned my place here.\n\nThis is the last stand of the samurai, the end of our era. But we will not go quietly into the pages of history; we shall write our personal entry and epitaph in blood and sweat. We hold steady, blades rasping on leather as we draw, and then there is the roar of five-hundred hearts as we charge.\n\nIt is a slaughter, but it as hard to know for which side. Half our number fall in the first volley, but the rest of us make it within range of swords and spears. I lunge forwards, naginata's razor edge keening at the air, and a straw-hatted peasant screams as he dies. \n\nWe fight like *oni*, demons of legend, and even as we are slowly whittled away still we strike out. I see Yatega fall with a knife in his back, nodachi stained with the blood of fifty men. I watch Aigo take four bullets to the chest and still finish his lunging stab, katana blade drinking deep of an enemy's lifeblood. He falls before his weapon does, and it soon follows its master to the bloodstained earth.\n\nI am one of the last to fall, but a bullet catches my shoulder and my armour is rent open. I fall to the ground, naginata falling from limp fingers, and I despair at my weakness. I reach for my naginata, but my limp fingers find only crimson earth, and then my vision fades to black.\n\nI awaken later, far later; the field is dark now, night has fallen, and still I lay amongst my fallen brothers. There are still soldiers picking through the corpses, taking trinkets and treasures from bodies. One of them rolls me over, and doesn't even realize I'm awake and alive before my hands are gouging at his face, thumbs digging into his eyes.\n\nHe screams as he dies, and I shove him off of me with a huff before slowly picking myself up off the ground and rising to my knees. My naginata rests at my feet, and I grasp it firmly in one hand before using it as a crutch to rise to my feet.\n\nSix peasants stand across from me,  blades in hand and eyes wide with fear and shock. I smile a bloodstained smile and raise my naginata in both hands. My strength is waning, I know, but the least I can do is kill these six. They realize I am a woman, and they begin laughing and exchanging words of mocking. My breath comes harder now.\n\nI don't know if I can kill them, but if I cannot, they will be my means of evading capture. I will force myself on their blades, if I must, better to die than face the dishonour of capture. I lean back, and prepare to charge to my death.\n\nThen the [Winged Hussar](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=75zmIj_4LFQ) arrives.\n\nA long spear drives itself home into one peasant's chest, and the man's screams of terror turn to gurgles of bloodsoaked surprise as he is forced back. Then a long curved blade unlike any I have seen before is lashing back and forth, cutting down my attackers with righteous fury. It is curious figure who does so, clad in great metal plates with vast wood and metal wings built into his backplate. They ride on the back of an enormous horse, it's figure barded richly in gold and red.  \n\nI watch as they do this, striking down foe after foe before they turn to me and nod once. They whistle, and there is a sound like ripping paper before a great hole seems to open in the air itself, showing a place not known to me, the edges blurry and wavy.\n\n\"Follow,\" they state, before spurring on their horse and leading me through the hole.\n\nI follow as commanded, and so begins my journey.\n\n**(What the hell was that? A meme that went too far, sort of, as well as my fetish for white dudes in armour and my Japanese heritage combining into the vast assembly before you. The general idea goes as follows; you, a figure from some last stand throughout history ([this album](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mxxQ44rCnXw) is pretty much a must have for this journey) saves me, one of the last surviving samurai of the battle of Shiroyama, and then we go on a magical time-travelling adventure with lots of sexy-times shenanigans, epic battles and Swedish Power Metal.)**\n\n**(The makings of an epic saga of war and glory or ridiculous and comedic trek through time and space? You decide along with me. Just select your Hero, send me some kinks and limits and we can get rolling. Welcome aboard, but be warned ladies and gentlemen; this train has no brakes. Or rails. Or engineer.)**",

Just like you did once you finished.\n\nSo!\n\nFor this role play, I was thinking of something a bit different. Different as in, you simply tell me who we are (husband wife, neighbors, older younger so and so\u2019s) and then you start the scene. The scene itself lasting maybe two or three replies before you finish, and that\u2019s that!!!\n\nI hope that sounds fun to you. Quite, playful, and fun!\n\nDrop me a pm and we can begin!\n\nPLEASE establish roles before you start. No need to ask, just go with what you want",

            "selftext": "Credits for the title go to the user who messaged me with it previously. Sorry, I don't remember your username!\n\n**DISCLAIMER: Just to preface this post, it involves bestiality and cuckolding, two kinks that many people may not want in their roleplays. It will also involve you controlling yourself as well as a dog. If you aren't into any of this, you can stop here, but thanks for stopping by!**\n***\nThings were going well, right? You thought so. Happily married for over five years now, a recent promotion at work, talk about having kids. It helped that your wife was a little firecracker who made every time feel like the first time. You knew she appreciated you, and the fact that you could live comfortably without her having to work. That's right, things felt perfect. Almost too perfect. While you thought you knew everything about your wife, you didn't know what she did when you weren't home.\n\nAbout a year ago, the two of you got a dog. While she insisted on adopting and not supporting puppy mills, the two of you fell in love with a sweet, innocent golden retriever when you took her out to a farm, and the rest was history. The two of you named him Teddy, just because she liked the name, and Teddy he became. He got his shots and all, everything he needed, but he wasn't neutered. You saw no reason to put him through that pain, and you didn't plan on getting another dog, so you weren't worried about it. Teddy got to keep his balls, and life went on.\n\nYou both adored Teddy equally, and he adored you both the same. As time went on, though, he noticeably favoured your wife, which was understandable. She was the one who was home with him most of the time, who fed him, took him for walks, and everything. Not that he wasn't excited to see you, but after you were settled in each night, he would cuddle with your wife as opposed to you, bring the ball to her as opposed to you, and sleep at her feet as opposed to yours. You weren't jealous. Why would you be? He was only a dog.\n\nWhat you didn't know, though, was that your wife did more than feed him, take him for walks, and do things for a dog that an owner should do. It wasn't out of the ordinary for Teddy to hump things, but one day, Teddy ended up humping her, and now it happens every day. When you come home, your wife kisses you with the same lips that were wrapped around Teddy's cock only moments or hours earlier, depending on the day. When you two begin to get frisky, you don't realize that you're getting Teddy's sloppy seconds. You don't know the extent of the lengths that your wife goes for your dog, but one of these days, you're going to unintentionally find out.\n***\nIf you read the disclaimer and continued to read, I'm assuming you're interested. I'll give you a brief outline of what I see this story turning into, since I feel like the prompt is a little bit open for interpretation.\n\nYour character is not normally submissive, but one day, he finds his foxy, loving wife, taking it from their dog somewhere in the house and absolutely loving it. Maybe he stays out of view and watches in jealously and disbelief, but also he finds himself more turned on than anything else. Maybe he confronts his wife, but finds that the dog won't stop, even if he or she tries to get him to, and he's forced to watch his pup become locked into his wife. Either way, he will be angry and aroused, and he will find himself as his wife's secondary lover. But maybe he soon starts encouraging it. Maybe he uses this opportunity to try darker, more depraved things with her. Maybe he brings in other guys, finding he may have had this submissive side all along.\n\nIf this isn't the direction you see the prompt going, that's not a problem, because I'd still love to chat about it. I am, however, looking for someone who is willing to write more than just a few sentences per response. Talking about the environment around the characters, emotions, inner dialogues...I like detail, and I would like a partner who could provide this.\n\nI've probably said enough, so if you're still with me, thank you for getting this far and I look forward to hearing from you. If I lost you at some point along the way but you still like the way I think, you should still send me a message, because I'm up for much more than just this one scenario.",

            "selftext": "Hey there Dirty Pen Pals! This might get a bit wordy, so buckle up! First of all, I'm bisexual so everybody is welcome! I would love to find somebody for something long - term, but I'm not very picky in that regard.\n\nFirst off, a bit about me. I'm 19 years old, as the title suggests. I have long blonde hair, green-blue-ish eyes and a pretty slim figure. I'm not chubby, but definitely not very muscular either. I also like to keep myself smooth and hairless as much as I can.\n\nI have a very high sex drive, and a lot of kinks, but they all lean in one general direction. I am completely submissive. I love being cucked, crossdressing and humiliation. I love being emasculated and feminized, ridiculed for thinking I was a man. It turns me on a lot when people treat me like a girl, doll me up like one and fuck me like one. I adore getting girly names, or more dirty ones. Somehow being called a faggot while getting fucked is one of the hottest things to me. Especially when you hold me down and slap my clitty while you do it.\n\nI also like to watch sissy hypnosis videos and would love to have a roleplay or something about being forced to watch sissy hypnos, transforming me into a full blown sissy girl. Turned into a bimbo girl, unable to cum without somebody using my holes...\n\nAnother thing I love doing is a little thing called fap roulette. It's a bunch of tasks somebody put together and you get to roll what you have to do. The ones that include lots of anal and don't let me cum in the end are probably my favourites.\n\nOkay I hope you have an idea what I'm looking for on here, and what my kinks and fetishes are. If you got this far, please tell me if you liked it!",

Someone who, with the aid of magic or science, helps keep you alive and gets you back in the fray. After the Raid is finished, the mission is complete, you reward me for such a job well done?\n\nFrom the swords and sorcery of Fantasy, where I would be a simple Cleric, casting restoration spell from behind my companions, be they knights, barbarians, or amazons, to the future where I'm the medic of a combat team, keeping back and patching any sudden holes that my teammates might have, or the odd laser or plasma burns, as well as repairing robotic parts.\n\nWhatever the case, I'll be sure to take care of your needs. You can count on me!\n\n/\n\n[Here\u2019s my Kinklist.](https://i.imgur.com/k5aKhGL.png) While I would like to do Fantasy over Sci-fi, I'm open to any and all ideas.\n\nDon't be afraid to try your hand, I'm always accepting messages.\n\nI hope we have some fun.\n\nP.S.

Why can't people understand that? \n\nFor the last hundred years or so, Angels, Demons, elves, dwarfs, and other races have been revealed to be real. Unfortunately, demons are still feared by, well just about everyone. So they tend to stay where life is best for them, back down in hell. \n\nWell in the last few years more demons have been moving up onto earth, what with the new magic that allows them to look less demon and more human. Unfortunately there tails, fangs and eyes tend to show through. Though a good number of the new comers tend to keep there normal looks.\n\nAnyways, you actual had never seen a demon before six months ago when school started. She wasn't in any of your classes, but you saw here everywhere on campus, usually by her self. Everyday you saw her, walking to class alone, eating alone, studying alone, etc. No one would go near her, once or twice she tried talking to people, but they would just quickly leave. \n\nThough you still didn't have much of a reason to talk to her, that was till one day she randomly walks up to you. \"Hey, I've notice you staring, what you want?\" \n\n\n\nAnd that's pretty much all I got! We don't have to play it out like that for a back story, that's just what I thought of, maybe we are childhood friends instead? Who knows, we can discuss stuff like that in pms! But as you guess I would like romance in this rp, but don't worry, lots of kinky sex is to be had! So, hope to hear from you! \n\nJust a FYI I do prefer woman over guys, that's all!",

            "selftext": "The rolling crack of a dozen thunder-guns shakes the field, splitting the calm air that had formed and replacing it with the chaos of the battlefield. We six-hundred stand side by side, blades in hands and honour in hearts, readying ourselves for the coming slaughter. We are outnumbered sixty to one, five-hundred samurai faced by thirty-thousand soldiers of the new empire.\n\nI hold my naginata tightly in my gloved hands, palms already sweaty from the heat of the fields of [Shiroyama](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylyqoxh-cXk) and my own nervousness, further proven by my roaring heart rate. I close my eyes a moment and breathe deep, a moment's meditation washing away the terror I feel inside of me and replacing it with steely resolve. Aigo sees me and nods once respectfully; I am the only woman amongst our number, but I have earned my place here.\n\nThis is the last stand of the samurai, the end of our era. But we will not go quietly into the pages of history; we shall write our personal entry and epitaph in blood and sweat. We hold steady, blades rasping on leather as we draw, and then there is the roar of five-hundred hearts as we charge.\n\nIt is a slaughter, but it as hard to know for which side. Half our number fall in the first volley, but the rest of us make it within range of swords and spears. I lunge forwards, naginata's razor edge keening at the air, and a straw-hatted peasant screams as he dies. \n\nWe fight like *oni*, demons of legend, and even as we are slowly whittled away still we strike out. I see Yatega fall with a knife in his back, nodachi stained with the blood of fifty men. I watch Aigo take four bullets to the chest and still finish his lunging stab, katana blade drinking deep of an enemy's lifeblood. He falls before his weapon does, and it soon follows its master to the bloodstained earth.\n\nI am one of the last to fall, but a bullet catches my shoulder and my armour is rent open. I fall to the ground, naginata falling from limp fingers, and I despair at my weakness. I reach for my naginata, but my limp fingers find only crimson earth, and then my vision fades to black.\n\nI awaken later, far later; the field is dark now, night has fallen, and still I lay amongst my fallen brothers. There are still soldiers picking through the corpses, taking trinkets and treasures from bodies. One of them rolls me over, and doesn't even realize I'm awake and alive before my hands are gouging at his face, thumbs digging into his eyes.\n\nHe screams as he dies, and I shove him off of me with a huff before slowly picking myself up off the ground and rising to my knees. My naginata rests at my feet, and I grasp it firmly in one hand before using it as a crutch to rise to my feet.\n\nSix peasants stand across from me,  blades in hand and eyes wide with fear and shock. I smile a bloodstained smile and raise my naginata in both hands. My strength is waning, I know, but the least I can do is kill these six. They realize I am a woman, and they begin laughing and exchanging words of mocking. My breath comes harder now.\n\nI don't know if I can kill them, but if I cannot, they will be my means of evading capture. I will force myself on their blades, if I must, better to die than face the dishonour of capture. I lean back, and prepare to charge to my death.\n\nThen the [Winged Hussar](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=75zmIj_4LFQ) arrives.\n\nA long spear drives itself home into one peasant's chest, and the man's screams of terror turn to gurgles of bloodsoaked surprise as he is forced back. Then a long curved blade unlike any I have seen before is lashing back and forth, cutting down my attackers with righteous fury. It is curious figure who does so, clad in great metal plates with vast wood and metal wings built into his backplate. They ride on the back of an enormous horse, it's figure barded richly in gold and red.  \n\nI watch as they do this, striking down foe after foe before they turn to me and nod once. They whistle, and there is a sound like ripping paper before a great hole seems to open in the air itself, showing a place not known to me, the edges blurry and wavy.\n\n\"Follow,\" they state, before spurring on their horse and leading me through the hole.\n\nI follow as commanded, and so begins my journey.\n\n**(What the hell was that? A meme that went too far, sort of, as well as my fetish for white dudes in armour and my Japanese heritage combining into the vast assembly before you. The general idea goes as follows; you, a figure from some last stand throughout history ([this album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Stand_(Sabaton_album)) is pretty much a must have for this journey) saves me, one of the last surviving samurai of the battle of Shiroyama, and then we go on a magical time-travelling adventure with lots of sexy-times shenanigans, epic battles and Swedish Power Metal.)**\n\n**(The makings of an epic saga of war and glory or ridiculous and comedic trek through time and space? You decide along with me. Just select your Hero, send me some kinks and limits and we can get rolling. Welcome aboard, but be warned ladies and gentlemen; this train has no brakes. Or rails. Or engineer.)**",

            "selftext": "[Inspired by the movie Chloe - which was not at all as enjoyable as its premise promised to be.]\n\nJeanette and David are a perfect couple. They are happily married with kids who left the house already, going to college. She is known in her town, working for the local library and being a nice woman to be around. He is a lawyer, successful and globetrotting, always around the world. Their marriage has currently hit a dry spell, with Jeanette accusing him of cheating on her. As he comes home to her birthday, Jeanette loses the last bit of faith she has in him. He writes suspiciously much on his cellphone and tries to hide something from her.\n\nIn the following days she hires a younger escort to meet David in the streets and convince him to cheat on his wife with her. Lea. Lea's only task is to try and see how loyal David really is and to report back what she did with him. Of course, David goes and cheats on Jeanette with the younger and more beautiful Lea. She tells Jeanette everything about their encounters, with the descriptions getting more graphic and intense from each and every meeting onwards. \n\nWhich in the following does not lead to Jeanette divorcing her husband, but to her weirdly enjoying what Lea does, enjoying the stories she tells her and finally also giving in to the younger girl that has stolen her husband from her. \n\n___\n\nWe can include a lot of things in this roleplay - what I mainly want from it is:\n\n-&gt; An incredibly detailed partner, who focuses on characters, emotions and feelings rather than pure sex.\n\n-&gt; To play an insecure housewife. Insecure about herself, about her husbands loyality, about her feelings towards Lea and about her own sexuality.\n\n-&gt; A long-term story in which Lea needs time to convince David, afterwards tells me, first just a little bit than more and more details, with me starting to masturbate to them and, weeks in, sleeping with Lea. TAKE YOUR TIME.\n\n-&gt; A girl or a guy to play with me. You get freedom in describing the sex and get to choose how Lea looks like.\n\n-&gt; Hit me with some interesting description of the character you're going to play, what fascinates you about this idea, your main kinks and limits.\n\nHere is a kinklist of mine: https://i.imgur.com/7D4v3Hw.png\n\nAnswers might take a while, will answer if I like it though.

She's just wonderful and today I'd love to play a scene, or scenes, that revolve around her. The Angel of Mercy.\n\nWhat route we take it is totally up in the air. Perhaps a romantic angle? Her lab partner when researching her healing capabilities and prototyping the suit? Late nights in the lab, long hours, frustration. What else would it lead to than the pair blowing off some steam hard and fast... And maybe all night.\n\nMaybe Commander Jack Morrison and Angela have hidden feelings for one another? When Jack comes to speak with her about a new mission which might end up with him dead due to its dangerous nature things get heated. Do they turn sexual? Of course! That tension that has been building for months finally breaks and they do what they've been fantasizing about for so long.\n\nOr perhaps it's Genji? The man who owes her life to Angela. Maybe after Overwatch's fall he finds her home back in Switzerland and pays her a visit? Not really thought this one through that much, open to discussions as I am with all other her ideas.\n\nOf course would could play her going out in her highest club dress and getting the hottest guy in the bar to rail her senseless over and over.\n\nAny other ideas? Feel free to throw them on over, I'll be open to most things as long as Mercy is there in some way or another.\n\n**I very much prefer playing OCs, however!**\n\nKinks: Large cock, rough/passionate sex, face fuck, hair pulling, choking, anal, oral, tight clothing, titfuck, heels/heeled boots, sexual tension, kissing, cuddling, romance, multiple loads, huge loads and much, much more.\n\nLimits: Children, death, incest, futa, beast, gore, shit, piss, vomit, vore, etc.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n\n*If the post is up I'm still looking!*",

            "selftext": "I smirk as I look over myself in the mirror, the black dress clung to every curve of my surgically enhanced body. The plunging neckline left little to the imagination, revealing the deep cleavage of my inflated E cup tits, always standing eagerly at attention thanks to the CCs of silicone pumped into them. My full plumped up red painted lips always formed an inviting pout, hanging slightly open to give a hint of the warm wetness inside. \n\n\nI reached up with one hand to run my long bright pink nails through my platinum blond hair as I turned this way and that, admiring how the 5 inch black stilettos forced my back to arch, my plump hips pushed out, further accentuating the perfection that was my body. Sure it had cost more money then I care to think about, and sure my professional life had suffered slightly. But it was all worth it for the thrill of walking into a club and knowing that every cock and every cunt that caught sight of me was primed and ready to go.\n\n\nWith a girlish giggle I turned and walked out the door, every night was a new adventure and this one was just getting started.\n_____________________\nHi DPP! So basically tonight I want to see the worst you have to throw at me! I want you to turn an over sexualized bimbo into a shell of a human being. Make me fat, break my mind, turn me into a disgusting little fuck piggy, inflate or deflate my tits so I look ridiculous, ruin my holes ... whatever you want ... I want you to make me cry ... to hate the body I spent so much money. Come on boys and girls I know you can do it!",
