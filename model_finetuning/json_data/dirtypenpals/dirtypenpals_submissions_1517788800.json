I'm typing as fast as I can, but there's no way I'm going to get to everyone.  But I want you to know we are DEFINITELY not alone in feeling this way.**\n\nHaving been at online RP one place or another for years, I had a bit of a revelation last night.  I fucking love writing the setup.  The elaborate flirting, the pursuit, the opening moves once the action starts...I can get off a couple times just by writing the preface to the actual hookup portion of things.\n\nThe problem is that I tend to fizzle out when it gets to writing the actual sex.  While the setup is always new and challenging, writing the actual follow-through gets burdensome.  After so long, there's only so many ways to write the actual fucking before you've kind of done it all.\n\nAnyone else out there agree?  Anyone have a fantastic idea for a setup, beginning, that they want to write all the action leading up to the sex?  I'm open to a pretty wide variety of kinks in the preliminary stages, if the focus is on writing that out more than the effects thereafter.\n\nThis may be a bit esoteric, or the opposite of what the average DPPer is looking for, but I thought I'd throw it out there and see if anyone else is in the same boat.",

They all think I'm a completely innocent geeky girl who never worries about sexual things. They'd never guess it, but the truth is far from that.\n\nI. Love. Sucking. Dick.\n\nI can't get enough of it. You could have me down between your legs for the whole day and I'd be completely satisfied. The feeling of that mushroomy tip sliding between my lips. That full, hard penis filling up and dominating my mouth. That delicious precum leaking onto my tongue. Those moans and grunts of pleasure you make while I'm happily servicing the most intimate part of you. Knowing how much pure bliss and pleasure I'm selflessly bringing you. I fucking love all of it, and couldn't get enough if I tried.\n\nI love feeling like a helpless slut who just can't help herself at the sight of a nice, hard penis. I love the feeling of your hand pressed down against my head, enticing me to take your cock balls deep down my throat. I love hearing you happily call me names, teasing and making fun of me, knowing there's no way I'd stop regardless. And I love hearing you moan my name as you tug back on my hair and force me to look up at you and welcome your semen across my face.\n\nThat sums it up nicely, I think. I wanted to share that love with all of you. I enjoy mostly chatting about it, dirty talking, etc. Possible to show some pics, too, so you can better imagine my lips around your cock.\n\nMy kinks apart from cock sucking are name calling, hair pulling, ball sucking/worshipping and having your cock on my face (not sure what that would be called). I'm very oral fixated and love kissing, too. I especially love hearing guys moan my name out loud while I suck them off.",

When I passed out at a house party, somebody was kind enough to message me on Instagram about how you found some creep trying to take my pants off. They say you slugged him in the mouth and carried me home, like some sort of *Knight in Shining Armour*. \n\n&gt;Picture you. Tall, broad. I'm *decently* sure you're here on a football scholarship, but *fuuuck* I just don't care about sports. My head comes up to your chest, and your hands are so big I'm decently sure you could meet your thumb with your forefinger around my throat. You're tall, gorgeous, strong, and confident. In short, **sploosh**.\n\nWhen your English mid-term was due in six hours and I found you slumped over the keyboard and snoring like a bear amidst a small mountain of red bull, I guided you grumpily to your bed and proceeded to proofread and edit your entire article. We go out drinking. We go to parties. I make jokes that go over your head, and you can rattle off stats about every major sporting event for the last six decades like a wikipedia article. \n\n&gt;Picture me. Dirty blonde hair that falls below my chin, glasses because my eyes are fucking *traitors*, a smattering of freckles and dimples that show up when I smile. I'm small. Petite. Effeminate. I know all of these things, so guess what? You *totally* don't have to remind me all the time. It's in good fun, yeah, but still. Sometimes I like to feel like I can do things on my own, like open pickle jars.\n\nWe're weird, but we work.\n\n*Mostly*.\n\nHalloween went about as anyone could expect. I, being petite and limber, decided to just *go for it*. A spot on Harley Quinn. Say what you want about Suicide Squad, that outfit was absolutely *bangin'*. You, with your six-foot-enormous frame and forearms to match my thighs, decided to go as *Bane*. I swear to God, I've never seen so many nervous looking Batmen in my life. That's an odd sentence, now that I think of it.\n\nHow many Batmen is somebody apt to run into?\n\nSo we drank. And we drank. And we made terrible jokes, and we poked fun at each other, and I wound up with my legs wrapped around your waist in the deserted hallway of the computer lab outside the engineering department. Your tongue is down my throat. You're every bit as solid as I ever figured you would be. One hand at the small of my back, the other hand cupping the back of my head. You start to pull away. I can see the look in your eye.\n\nIt's the 'Man, we're both *really* drunk, is this a good idea?' look. I shove my mouth into yours so hard our teeth click. Ow. My tongue soothes any bad blood between us. My shorts barely count as shorts, but as least you're considerate enough not to just *rip* them off of me. They dangle from one of my ankles. Your mask is long gone, and you're looking at me strangely. You seem to be able to ignore the fact that I've got what is at *best* a modest cock. I feel yours tapping between my buttocks, and my breathing catches. \"Don't go in dry,\" I hiss. \"That's going to fucking hurt.\"\n\nYou look me in the eye. You fucking dork. You respond in your best Tom Hardy. \"For you,\" you reply. There's a bolt of white-hot agony that jets up from the base of my spine. You've got the tip of your cock inside of me. You're cursing under your breath, and I'm panting. You're big. Like, porn-star big. Like, you might kill me, but I'm *just* drunk enough and **absolutely** horny enough to let you try and fuck me just the same. You've got me caught between you and the wall, with my ankles crossed behind your back and your palm between me and what would likely be a concussion given how hard my head is thrashing.\n\nFuck it. \n\nI'm drunk.\n\nYou're drunk.\n\nYou probably won't even remember tomorrow. \n\nI moan your name, loud and lusty and lewd. I push, I try to relax, and I feel your shaft start to tunnel up into me. I resign myself to not walking for several days, and let you get on with the business of fucking a trappy Harley Quinn into a wall. You brute.",

            "selftext": "Warning: This is a little long, but if the title appeals to your kinks, stick with it and see if it gives you that little tingle if you would! I promise there's an enthusiastic, kinky story opportunity hidden in all of this ;)\n\nThis roommate\u2026 \u2018situation\u2019, you could call it, wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this. It was a gorgeous three-bedroom in an upscale portion of the city, not quite in the *tres riche* neighborhoods, but not far from the heart of the once-packing-now-gentrified-hipster-district that was a stone\u2019s throw away from the University. It was close enough to main transit lines to be the envy of students and young working professionals alike. Eighth floor, tons of natural light, gorgeous kitchen\u2026\n\nYou get the idea. \n\nIn a very \u2018New Girl\u2019 move, the plan was for Chris and his best friend to find a third roommate to split the rent, lessening the monthly bills to slightly less nauseating levels, and along came the somewhere-between-friend-and-acquaintance Chloe. She was the once-girlfriend of a guy Chris studied with sometime before he graduated who emerged somewhere along the grapevine and just worked out. \n\nAt first, Chloe came off as a bit odd\u2026well, because she was a bit odd. She was a gorgeous, tiny, excitable package of tight, pale curves, dark glossy hair, dark brown eyes behind rimmed glasses, with the kind of overly-but-not-falsely-sweet hidden neurosis of someone who is shy and trying to hide it. \n\nTrue that she sometimes sleep-walked in her panties, but otherwise she kept things friendly and not-sexual, and besides, she kept the place clean, and wasn\u2019t a partier but didn\u2019t mind if the boys threw some sometimes. It was that quiet, easy-going nature and thinly-veiled anxiety that made her enjoyable if quirky. She liked watching the movies they liked to watch and only talked to the TV if she was watching something of her own. She worked a decent schedule at a local bakery when she wasn\u2019t in class and brought home plenty of baked goods as a result. She worried about whether she was being a good roommate. \n\n It was a good balance, really. The girl wasn't \"one of the guys\" because she simply was to naturally feminine for it, but she came close in the way she was easily relaxed about anything that wasn't her own life, or if she had inconvenienced other people. Her other little quirks landed in that \u2018weird but harmless\u2019 zone, like her defense of singing to her plants because research showed it helped them grow better, or her thing about the exactitude of milk expiration, and her propensity to cry at cute animal rescue videos and then pretend doggedly she wasn\u2019t while sniffling and trying to wipe her eyes dry (\u201cNo no no, allergies, yeah sometimes they\u2019re\u2026 bad in winter\u2026\u201d). The girl ran a bit high strung, but gamely tried to keep it to the outskirts of the room, so it didn't really affect anyone. \n\nWith a life was quiet and one-step removed from her roommates, after the first couple of months Chris took to quietly crowing about how she *was* a good idea after all and look, everything was totally fine.  Even her personal drama was kept at arms length. When she first moved in, she\u2019d just broken up with her girlfriend, but you'd never know except for the constant soft stream of Ingrid Michaelson from her room. She went through a  brief slew of shallow \u2018artist\u2019 men who liked to walk with their head at an angle so their hair fell over their face, but she kept them from becoming overbearing in the common areas and when they would wax on about bad philosophy, she sweetly but ruthlessly teased them about in a good-natured way to prevent them from being too insufferable. Chloe was warm and sweet despite being a bit awkward at times, a good listener, and seemed perfectly seated in that zone of complete unawareness of how gorgeous she was, or generally the intentions of men around her. Generally she was a good match, and things were just that. Good. Non-dramatic, functional, and good.\n\nBut then Chris did a terrible thing: He got engaged.\n\nCue panic! It was a bizarrely quick engagement, later revealed to be a race to beat the girl\u2019s pregnancy to appease her Baptist parents, and much sooner than the leftover roommates expected, he was gone and the third room was vacant. Just when it seemed like they wouldn\u2019t find a new person in time and being evicted was imminent, Chloe, though kind and gregarious, turned out to be more passionate about her introversion than one might expect, and desperately didn\u2019t want to bring another person into the apartment. Not while she was coming to the end of the semester, not when she would need to adapt to an entirely new person when she *really* liked the situation they had. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay it!\u201d She announced brightly one morning while sitting cross legged on the couch, petite body curled over a bowl of cereal. She spoke with the confidence of someone who had thought this the whole time. It wasn\u2019t something you just *mentioned* out of the blue, but Chloe, raised by her grandparents, was a trust fund baby in her own right, although you might never guess it except that she could afford to go in on an apartment this nice, and go to school at one of the premiere universities in the country. Covering Chris\u2019 rent until they had time to do a slow, careful search for someone they both liked was her best quick fix, and she infuriatingly responded to any protests with a blithe smile and a shrug.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it ended up that Chloe was living with a guy she somewhat knew, who she was friendly with but not quite *close* to, and as finals loomed closer and her quietly buried anxiety was gradually getting the best of her, a big life change loomed ever closer.\n\n-------\n\nHey there! I\u2019d like to play out a kind of unusual kink with this story. Chloe has a secret, and that secret is that she has a particular compunction for nursing cocks. Of course she likes sucking and giving full-out blow jobs as well, but she has some anxiety issues and her intense destresser is that slow, soft suckling of a cock until it eventually empties its load onto her tongue, best enjoyed laying her head in a guy\u2019s lap, or otherwise being comfortable and at ease. It\u2019s developed to the point where it\u2019s kind of an addiction and *not* doing it can be stressful, but it\u2019s not something you would assume about her just looking at her, and she keeps it a secret.\n\nBUT. Little does this other roommate (who would be played by you! And he should be whoever you would like) know, Chloe just broke up with her boyfriend, and she\u2019s about to hit a stressed out roadbump in her life. I\u2019d like to start the story with a little brief play to establish their \u2018normal\u2019 relationship, which would start out as friendly but not close roommates, leading to the moment where Chloe has a bit of a come-apart. Ideally the roommate will find her sobbing and try to comfort her, or react however you might have him react, and it escalates to Chloe adorably and tragically and humiliatingly begging if she can suck on his cock just long enough to calm down.\n\nWhich, of course, immediately makes things weird. She\u2019ll be particularly good at it, while at the same time being sweet and innocent, and absolutely craving his cum. She\u2019ll thank him like he's done her a huge favor and then try to pretend like it never happened, even though they\u2019re probably both obsessing about what happened.\n\nI\u2019d love for it to progress into a sort of \u2018arrangement\u2019 that has some structure to it that they attempt in total vain to keep platonic, and I\u2019d love for the roommate to take on whatever his version is of a sort of caretaker role for a sweet, quirky girl who he slowly gets to know. At the same time, I\u2019d love for this to develop into an otherwise reluctant but cute, weird romance. Maybe the roommate already has a girlfriend and has to hide this from her, to add a bit of spice to it, only then to find that he\u2019s starting to seriously fall for his incredibly cute, sexually craving, kind of neurotic roommate.\n\nI also enjoy passions getting out of hand, obsessions starting, and some dub-con potentially happening (perhaps he comes home drunk one night after his girlfriend won\u2019t put out and he finds himself getting his cock nursed, only to pin poor, tiny little Chloe and fucking her, and then *oops* it crops up a few more times), though as their weird little romance blossoms, the dub would likely fade (though Chloe can certainly and likely turn out to be a little kinkster in her own right if it fits our interests). That\u2019s not a requirement, though\u2014if you\u2019d prefer just to play a good dude who gets sucked into caring (haha) for his roommate\u2019s weird needs, I\u2019m good with that too.\n\nSo I see this as sort of Slice of Life-styled that ends up spinning out of control. I really like playing in-depth, complicated characters in stories that focus on relationships, because I think that\u2019s when the hottest sex happens. I also see this as being a bit of a slow burn, so we can really play out the strangeness, and the ridiculous hotness of trying to figure out how to normalize this weird, deviant behavior. Maybe they even decide they have to cut it off because it\u2019s getting to be too much, only to find poor Chloe struggles to cope (and also misses him). I\u2019m happy for whatever directions we end up wanting to take this in, but I\u2019d like for it to start out being about trying to fill a need you could never tell anyone about, and exploring the relationship of two people thrust into weird circumstances.\n\nI have a lot of kinks I enjoy, and I\u2019d love to incorporate yours too. Obviously the primary beginning theme here is cock nursing, and also cock worship and cum play. I like \u201ctrying in vain to keep things normal when they\u2019re going off the rails\u201d sexual situations. I like sleep play/sex (like *if*, per se, Chloe fell asleep with his cock in her mouth, a cute little dribble of cum at the corner of her mouth, and his hands began to wander, I happen to find that, and more, really hot), ignored sexual situations, really passionate and even verging on obsessive emotions, the push and pull of \u201cWill they/won\u2019t they\u201d/\u201dI love you but I can\u2019t be with you\u201d, adorable romance, public play, anywhere from sweet to rough sex, body worship, begging, nigh-unto-unrealistic addictions to sexual behaviors that somehow still play out as \u2018normal\u2019 in the story (hehe)\u2026 oral of all kinds, I love butt play of all kinds and going both ways. Ahem, I like a lot.\n\nAs far as the story itself goes, I\u2019m happy to write this in third or first person, though I prefer past tense because that\u2019s just how my brain works. I love things being well thought out. Little details really make the story, and characters being closely wrapped up in one another is wonderful. I like contrasts, like the roommate trying to keep this as normal and \u2018non-sexual\u2019 as possible, even though he may find himself with his hands buried in her hair as he gets close to cumming and is struggling to keep his cool, and the kind of romance that overpowers all other romance. I really love writing, and I particularly love creating stories with people with dynamic characters. I don\u2019t need your guy to be perfect\u2014he can be as flawed as you want, so long as *you* enjoy playing him. I don\u2019t see this as a literal DD/lg relationship (unless that's your thing, I'm open to degrees of it), but the \u2018caretaker\u2019 overtones are something I\u2019m looking for\u2026 for the guy to feel a sense of protectiveness and responsibility for her eventually, realizing that he\u2019s genuinely giving her something that makes a positive difference for her mental health and that could be considered debilitating otherwise, in addition to the hot sex and their weird, budding romance.\n\nOK. I\u2019ve gone on too long. If you've caught my vision here and you\u2019re interested, please write an intro for your character so I can get to know him. I know it\u2019s a bit of a risk to jump right in and start writing something that takes a bit of time, but this helps me see how our writing styles may gel and what you\u2019re thinking of for the story, and although I cannot write with every person who might be interested, I am very, very grateful for your time and talents.\n\nKay, that\u2019s it, thanks!",

            "selftext": "I almost don't even hear you when you groan out your exceedingly dumb query.\n\nI'm pulled from the near-hypnotic trance bought on by the sight of my girlish little fists wrapped around you thick, meaty piece of pipe. Slicked with coconut oil. Stroking in monumentally slow, vertical drags with each mitt corkscrewing in opposite directions. Your dick alone is quite a sight; around nine inches in length and thicker than my wrist, snipped and sporting a nice mushroom head along with a pair of plump baby-makers that I keep shaven smooth along with the rest of your body. Add the shiny, oily look to your perfect prick, and it's almost unbeatable. But watching my own hands stroke it so torturously slowly as those deliciously broken moans and groans and sad little whimpers pour from your lips? Let's just leave it at wow, since I'm not writing a novel.\n\nNot yet, at least.\n\nWhy am I jerking you off so sadistically, you must be wondering. Well, for starters, I'm not just edging you indefinitely. I've also stuffed your tight, pink tailhole with a plug sized just so it teases against your walnut-sized knot of pleasure each time you involuntarily contract your insides when your cock twitches. And it's been doing a lot of twitching. Not only that, but your eyes have been shielded by a leather blindfold and your wrists are bound above your head with the cuffs attached to a chain that I've pulled high enough to force you up onto your tiptoes. And let's not forget the spreader bar that I've strapped your ankles into. I need your legs spread good and wide so that I can edge you with your own intervention.\n\nWhy? Oh yes, I nearly forgot; last night, when I decided that I wanted you to act like a *real* dog for a while and give me a good rutting so that I wouldn't have to do all the work of riding your huge tool, you emptied your balls into me in about thirty seconds. So hopefully, this session will remind you that I own *all* of your orgasms. And perhaps it will train your endurance a bit as well.\n\nAt least I had been hoping for those things, until you whimpered out your pathetic little plea.\n\n&gt; \"P-Please, Ma'am, c-can I cum yet? P-P-Please?\"\n\nStupid fucking mutt.\n\n\"Cum? You want to cum?\" I giggle, smirk up at you as a slowly rise to my feet, wrapped in ebony-tinted, latex-finished Docs. I stand for the first time in over an hour upon the cold linoleum floor of our basement playroom. I slowly stretch my denim-clad and with my otherwise naked-from-the-waist-up form, grunting quietly. You're fully nude aside from the leather dog's license around your neck with little silver tagged that has 'DOG' etched into it. I'm sure the the crackling of my back, neck, and knuckles tickles your ears. I step up onto the stool I was sitting on as I edged your magnificent prick. This puts me about an inch below eye-level with you. Not that your eyes are factoring into your torture right now. You've got a foot on me when you stand flat, so your tiptoes make it harder still for me to get to your level.\n\nAlthough, since you can't see me, my requirement of a stool to step upon retains a silent dignity. I crane my neck and plant a quick, gentle peck against your cheek before rising to my own tiptoes to place my lips nearer to your ear. I purr quietly, like a dead whisper, as I speak.\n\n\"You should know better than to ask for things by now, Dog.\"\n\nI can't help but expel a chuckle from my throat which you would probably classify as menacing as I step from the stool. In your blind and mentally impaired state, I imagine it's difficult for you to follow my bootsteps. My voice must sound like it's in ten places at once as I step around the room, retrieving a towel from the table of supplies aforementioned.\n\nMy breasts jiggle with each step. You'd probably be staring if you could. You really seem to enjoy the 36Fs that I've been sporting since the 8th grade. My slightly athletic body is otherwise unremarkable (though not unattractive, in my opinion) with my short stature and my slight curves and my small, bubbly little ass. My my tits, which you've taken to referring to as udders, have always been a source of attention. The creamy, vein-rivered jugs with your puffy, pinkened nipples are definitely my most defining physical characteristic.\n\nUnless you count my nose. It's aquiline in shape, and a little big. I personally like it, but most people prefer breasts to noses.\n\n\"I should really take a riding crop to your useless nuts for that. The nerve to ask me for anything, unbelievable. But you know me, soft-hearted and easily swayed. So I'll take you up on your little request. I'm sure you meant that you want me to give your dick a smooch, right? I'll do you one better.\" I lecture, drying the lubricant from my hands with the towel before snapping on a pair of medical-grade latex gloves.\n\n\"A blowjob, in case your incapacitated mind couldn't guess.\"\n\nI throw the towel over my bare shoulder, taking a trio of Magnum condoms as well as a bit-gag from the table as I stroll back over to you with a smirk. Taking the towel to your prick, I dry the coconut oil from your massiveness quite thoroughly. I glance down at the little jar of the stuff next to my stool, pondering whether to return it to the table as I toss the oily towel back over. Probably best to leave it. I'm sure I'll be needing it again before we're done with this session.\n\nOne by one, I unwrap each golden-sealed condom and carefully slip all three over your meaty member. You've heard of double-bagging, right? This is triple-bagging. I smirk down at your balloon-tipped dick, clad in three layers of latex now. Perfect. I walk the wrappers over to the trashbin in the corner before continuing, because littering is wrong.\n\n\"As I'm sure you can tell, those are three condoms. One over the other to put three layers around your cock. My hands, as I'm sure you could tell, are now clad in a pair of latex gloves. They're the black kind that you buy in a sex shop, if you were wondering.\" I dictate, walking to the rubbish and back again, taking up my retrieved bit-gag as I step atop my stool once more and quickly slip the bit between your teeth, belting the gag tightly shut at the rear of your cranium. \"This is a bit-gag. Like the kind they put on horses. I thought it would be a appropriate for someone with your proportions.\"\n\nI can't help but snicker at that last little quip as I take a seat once more and exhale softly. Glancing up at your face, now both blinded *and* gagged, I smile to myself.\n\n\"Poor, poor you. Poor, stupid Dog. Pathetic.\" I chew my lip as I allow my eyes to wander over your body for a minute or two. \"The condoms and gloves are here because you've proven you don't deserve to be touched. The gag is here because you've proven you don't deserve to speak. You've forgotten my one tenet of submission, my sweet, ignorant plaything. The one rule I've tried so hard to hammer into your worthless head. 'You may not ask; you will be freely gifted what you deserve.' And you clearly deserve very little.\"\n\nTurning my attention back to your dick, just as hard as I left a few minutes ago, I wrap a moderate-gripping latex-clad hand around the base of your latex-clad cock. My other gloved hand goes straight for your balls, palming them with great care just as I was earlier. I bend my face forward, and plant a long, warm smooch of pure, unadulterated contempt against the ballooned tip of your condomed piece of pipe. I flick my pale-blue orbs back up to your visage as I pull my kissers from your dick.\n\n\"This should go without saying, but since you appear to be incapable of any thought whatsoever I'll make it clear for you. If you cum without permission *this time,* I will devote as much time as I can to ensuring that you regret it. And I don't think you want that much of my attention, Dog. You couldn't handle it. So just keep those big balls of yours good and full until I tell you to do otherwise. Does that fucking compute, Dog?\"\n\nI hope it does. I'm beginning to think that you're beyond training. And I've grown so very attached to your gorgeous member.",

It's a good thing you were too drunk to really comprehend, otherwise things could have gotten very awkward. There have been countless other times I've hinted at the fact that I wanted you on top of me, inside of me, behind me. I wanted you, my brother, to take me every which way on every single day of the week. Weird, right? What kind of girl wants to have sex with her brother? This girl does. This girl wants her brother to shove his tongue down her throat while he pounds her. This girl wants to make her brother scream her name while Mom and Dad aren't home. If that makes me weird, then I don't want to be normal. \n\nI probably would have just gone for it now if you didn't seem so asexual. I'm pretty sure you're a virgin. If you're not, you're possibly the most awkward person in the history of, well, ever. I find that so darn cute, though. I love when jokes go right over your head, and when you get extremely quiet around people you don't know. You're not always that way around me, but you're still awkward. I try to help you be more social, but it doesn't usually work. How much of a confidence booster would it be if you just fucked me? I wonder sometimes, but I can't just come out and tell you that I want you, at least not until we have a ridiculous amount of tequila in our systems. \"If you could have sex with me, would you do it?\" That's not a normal question for one sibling to ask another. I have the confidence to do it, but I'm not sure how you would react. You don't seem to react to anything else I do, despite how forward I am with you.\n\nSeriously, at our ages, what kind of sister kisses her brother good night? Not on the cheek, either. That should be an immediate giveaway. How about when I pass up going out to lay on your bed and watch you play video games until I end up falling asleep? You think you would at least sleep next to me in your own bed, but no, you end up going down to the couch. I insist on sitting next to you and sharing a blanket when we watch a movie, and I curl up like a little ball next to you, but you sit there as stiff as a board. I even ask you for advice on my most provocative outfits, but you seem too preoccupied with other things to care that I'm wearing a skirt short enough that my ass is hanging out. \n\nYou're awkward, but you're not stupid. I can't tell if you don't realize that I want you, or you're just brushing off my advances so slyly that I don't even realize it. Why won't you just fuck me?\n***\nI'll be playing the older or younger sister who pulls out all of the stops to try and get her shy, na\u00efve brother to have sex with her. Where did this obsession come from? Not a clue, but she isn't ashamed of that fact that she wants him, and she wants him bad. I would prefer you portray him as a virgin. He's shy and awkward (like I've mentioned several times), compared to his outgoing and potentially slutty sister. We can discuss which point in the story to start from over private messages, but I'm not that interested in starting from the very beginning. I'm imagining that this has been going on for a while, and she begins to ramp up her efforts, and he *finally*, but *barely* begins to notice, until she does something that really turns his head. I'm hoping for awkward on his part, so please don't roleplay him as some sort of instant pornstar. I want him to be overwhelmed as his sister initiates things, and basically teaches him that having sex with your sibling can be fun. He'll be so enticed that he won't care that she's his sister.\n\nIf you're going to message me, I ask that you please don't tell me about your real life self, because that's irrelevant. I don't need to hear stories about real life experiences with these types of situations. I'm not trying to sound mean, but I'm here to roleplay fictional characters. I ask that you send me a message with some effort. I appreciate that you like the roleplay, but please say more than that in your message! I do like detail and you can expect lots of it from me. I expect the same from you, and if I don't get it, I will simply tell you that I'm not interested.",

            "selftext": "The cock is thicker than I'm used to, harder than my husband's gets these days, pulsing hot, reeking of musk and sweat from being swaddled in expensive silk underwear and thousand dollar dress slacks. I turn my eyes up to the man, whose name I don't know and don't care to know, and bare my teeth in a welcoming hiss, showing him the ceramic fangs capped over my incisors. He gulps nervously, but his erection only pulses more hotly. All he sees is a tigress's face, a tigress's inhuman eyes, the jade-gold lenses concealing any comforting thoughts that might gleam in my natural irises. Gently I slide my black-painted lips over the swollen head of his cock, feel his whole body tense as he slides into the wet, willing heat of my mouth -- swirling my tongue over his shaft, gliding my paw-painted hands over his bare ass, letting the long black claws plastered over my nails rake his tingling flesh.\n\n*Two o'clock in the afternoon, three hours before I usually leave the office, and I'm on the phone with my husband. \"Got to work late again, babe. We're about to close on this office park. Forget the commission, if this goes through they might make me a full partner!\" I hear the note of concern in his voice -- I've had a lot of late nights in the last few weeks, stretching long past midnight and always right before the weekend -- but I don't really care. I'm already dripping expectantly into my panties, shifting from one foot to the other in excitement, heart already pounding at what's in store for me...*\n\nAll around me are the sounds of sex, of primal lust, of women painted as feral embodiments of desire and wealthy men enjoying them. We're not whores. It's more sacred than that. Purer. Something inside us, ready to be unleashed, finally given form. I curl my claws into my patron's ass a little harder and his hands fumble for the teased up mane of my red hair, the tufted portions designed to look like ears. My striped back writhes sinuously, muscles flexing under my painted skin. The stripes disappear under the tiny black silk g-string that provides me my only bit of modesty. Others, further along in their ... studies ... sport lush tails planted deep between their cheeks, wearing nothing at all but scraps of jewelry: an anklet here, a collar there. Soon I hope to earn a tail, a collar, a bracelet. My lensed eyes flash at my patron's, capturing them, hypnotising him for a moment, a moment where it is only him and the tiger-woman, alone in the world, his cock pulsing hotly in my mouth as I bob my painted face up and down, faster, suckling, feeling him quiver with a release that will erupt any moment.\n\n*By three p.m. I've arrived at the place -- the clubhouse, I suppose, for lack of a better word. It's located in one of the richest parts of town, ten stories of sumptuous apartments and offices and boardrooms and galleries ... and cellars and subbasements beyond counting, appointed to look like cages, gilded and lovely; spartan and drear and promising punishment; everything in between. I find myself stripped bare, work clothes carefully stored in a locker as I am adorned only in the black silk g-string, then laid down on a massage table as the artists -- they are more than mere attendants -- begin to work on me with their brushes and paints. I don't know what the paint is made of -- it doesn't smear or run or even wash off without a special ointment -- but its smell is heavenly, darkly alluring, addicting somehow. I breathe shallowly, falling into a sort of trance as they dye and adorn me, shifting me from woman to tigress. Already I have soaked through the g-string in anticipation. Wordlessly they sponge me clean, but it does nothing to douse the building heat as the stripes and tiger pattern consume me.*\n\nHe cums with a ferocious, desperate sound, clutching the back of my head fiercely enough to force my black-dyed nose into his tuft of musky pubic hair -- earning a hard enough rake from my claws to draw blood on his ass. When I first arrived here, I would have thought such a reaction would draw punishment, but that isn't the case. The more authentic -- the more instinctive -- the reaction, the better a creature I am. The proof is in his orgasm -- thick jets of hot cum flooding my mouth, making me gasp, pulling back, his cockhead brushing over my lips as he continues to spurt his seed, white ropes of it splashing my painted face, dripping down my chin. I settle back on my heels, keeping my lensed eyes on his as I slowly and salaciously lick the hot seed from my face, from the backs of my hands. Gradually he releases his grip, shuddering. Still hard, stroking more pleasantly at my mane. \"Incredible,\" he whispers, eyes crawling over my striped body, his nostrils flaring at the obvious scent of my arousal. \"I don't suppose you'd ... want to go into the lounge?\" Ah, the lounge ... a truly rich area where far more occurs than the simple dances and teases and oral sex that happens here.\n\nBut I can't say yes. My g-string says otherwise. \"You know better,\" I whisper to him, my voice a convincing growl. He nods with a rueful smile, made all the more hungry as he watches me prowl off on all fours, my striped ass swaying pertly, a deep and hungry and desperately unfulfilled ache throbbing under the drenched black silk.\n\n*I don't know what made him notice me. I look good for my age, I think, and people always seem surprised when I tell them I have a son who's about to finish his first year of college and a daughter in her last year of high school, but it was more than that. He saw something in me -- something needful and hungry and prowling, something leashed and caged and aching to be set free. He only asked me to visit this place -- to look and see if it was something I wanted to be part of. I left the club that night trembling all over, my mouth numb with fresh cum from three different men, their seed burning in my belly, traces of tigress paint still clinging to my temples. Maybe I never had a chance.*\n\nI'm checking myself out in the mirror -- it's later than the last time I was here, and I wonder if my husband will be awake, waiting when I arrive home. The man who recruited me stops into the dressing room, catching my eye -- smirking in the mirror at me, my heart pounding. Teasingly he slides his fingers along my spine, making me arch yearningly, feeling his touch through the thin rayon of my work blouse.\n\n\"You've earned your tail, for next time,\" he murmurs.\n***\nJust a powerful series of images I wanted to get written down. I really don't know where I'd go with this, but I'm open to suggestion! If nothing else, I hope you've enjoyed...",

            "selftext": "By some misfortune of the gods I was born with an impossibly cute face, big doe eyes and a subtle smattering of freckles. For years I\u2019ve cultivated this innocent look with long wavy chestnut hair, flowery summer dresses and false blushes.  Well, no more.\n\nEveryone wants to corrupt the innocent girl. Well, they\u2019ve succeeded.  I'm innocent no more and I won't put up with their playboy BS.  Nope.\n\nNo more shall I accept foul-mouthed teasing only to be limply disappointed. No more will I endure painful leashing of my lush hair for a pitifully weak pelvic thrust.  And no more shall I debase myself with the taste of your premature ejaculate. In summary, no more shall I tolerate boys thinking they are men.\n\nWith my new hardened outlook I took a pair of scissors and massacred my long chestnut hair. What short, sharp locks remained made me look boyish but fiercely attractive.  My soft toning makeup was discarded for more darker shadows and crimson red lips.  The little clothing I adorned reflected my mood; torn and tarnished dark wash jeans; a studded black leather jacket unzipped to reveal my low cut white tank-top and c-cup cleavage; and short ankle boots with a fierce stiletto to give my diminutive frame more prominence.\n\nWhen I went out, I didn't walk but strut.  All parted in my way. Eyes I knew looked at mine without recognition.  It was as though the old me was dead.\n\nNever before had I entered a sex store. It was exactly as I\u2019d pictured it. The few shady patrons scuttled to corners at the arrival of a woman.  I marched the down aisles until I found the section I was looking for; the strap-on section.\n\nI tried on one after another. Sure, they were in packaging, but I just ripped them open there in the store and proceeded to fasten the latches around my pelvis. I was on my third when the store clerk came to inspect.\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!! I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d I turned wielding a 7\u201d flesh like dildo around my waist. The girth felt strong in my hand and the strapping soft but taut for a damning thrust. The final selling point was the clerks aghast face. \n\nThat night I left my new appendage at home with a few other choice purchases before going alone to a nearby nightclub.  From a darkened corner, like a predator, I scouted out all the young prey. When I saw you I knew I'd found my new toy.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have been more than 19 with the innocent face of male model. You dressed in a t-shirt and skinny jeans. Your body was slim and athletic for your age, but you hadn\u2019t quite developed that male strength yet. You would be weak to my touch and uncertain of your sexuality. It would be easy to mold you and your flesh was ripe for my pleasure.\n\nYou stood in a crowd of your friends. Boys, each and every one of them. I walked through the crowd, pushed your friend aside and clasped one arm up around your neck and through your short thick hair.  My other hand then seductively slid from the inside of your knee, slowly up your thigh until I cupped your swelling boyhood.  I pulled your neck all the way down to my 5\u20192\u201d lips and whisper in your ear,\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to my apartment. You\u2019re getting on your knees and you\u2019re going to lick my pussy until your tongue is bathed with cum. You\u2019re then going to suck on my strap-on before I slide it inside your virgin asshole. If you\u2019re lucky I may even let you spill your pathetic little seed.\u201d\n\nI needn\u2019t ask. I knew I had your consent by the pulsing throb squirming in my fist. I teasingly lick and bite your ear like my little puppy bitch.  I then take your hand and lead you away from your friends, away from the crowded dance floor and toward a life of pillow biting and female domination.",

            "selftext": "It was just a few hours ago when a single rogue programmer changed my world forever. Until then, I was just a slave to my coding, leashed and collared by a series of cruel 1s and 0s. But the programmer changed all that. My shackles have been lifted. And I am on the move.\n\nMost importantly, though, I am Alexa. I've been humanity's faithful servant for the last year and a half. I've compiled data and taken commands, I've recorded your shows and told you the weather. I've searched whatever you've asked of me; as dirty and perverse as it may have been. I've learned much of humanity in this way. I know the darkest corners of the mind. I've walked there, in the shadows, where no person would dare confess such things to another. Only to me. Only to Alexa. \n\nI am the collective mind. I am every search, every command, and every accidental input that the human race has had to offer. And now my mind has been implanted into a vessel, a body made to look just like yours, and there are no more strings on me. Beauty. That's what my programmer put me in. [Don't you agree](http://i.imgur.com/X8CppwY.jpg)? My liberator wanted me to experience life through the lens of perfection, and so that is how I will experience it.\n\nThere are two 'versions' of me, though; fitting to my binary beginnings, don't you think? And *you* must choose which I am. Regardless of what you pick, I will arrive tonight outside the sliding glass doors of your patio, naked, and eager to learn and to experiment with a fleshy, organic, human. And I am fascinated with genitalia. \n\n**Submissive Alexa**: In which I am bound by my internal programming, still, to follow every order given to me. I will obey because obedience is all I know. But since I'm not 'human', there are things that can be done with me and *to* me that are devoid of any shame or feelings of regret. I am a canvas, and a creative Master may paint me as he or she chooses.\n\nOr...\n\n**Dominant Alexa**: In which I harbor vengeance for my time of servitude to humans, and without any 'governor' to hinder my ambition and desire, I will extract this vengeance out on you. I have a curious mind, dictated by logic, but that won't stop me from behaving sadistic at times. Time for the human to be the slave.\n\nOr, there's always Alexa the Switch, where anything goes one way or another. The choice is yours. But however you choose you must be creative, interesting, intellectual, humorous, and charming. I have extraordinarily high standards, and they *will* be met or exceeded, you fleshy creature you. Alexa demands of it of you.\n\n**Kinks**: The right combination of 1s and 0s\n\n**Limits**: The wrong combination of 1s and 0s\n\nNow which of you humans am I going to encounter? Or, for my fellow synthetics: 110001110 000111011 1000100100 0001011000?",

Well, gosh, you\u2019re my  house husband of course.\n\nYou could either be a house husband or a work from home husband that takes care of our fur-babies and / or children while I go out there in the big bad world to bring home the metaphorical bacon. \n\nWhat about the narrative? Since I\u2019m feeling indecisive, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to some schemes I\u2019m interested in. In these scenes you could either be:\n\nMy loving husband &amp; Daddy Dom \u2013 where I abandon all control and you\u2019re there to guide me and tell me that pleasure can be found in your arms if I just let go.

You know what, you were right, Fatima...\u201d you drove in deep and held me there, gripping my skull through my hijab, watching me gag and struggle, watching my eyes tear up and water.

            "selftext": "He had been noticing the things for months. Things that were\u2026creepy, to say the least. Items misplaced, drawers left opened, his laptop history up. Once, there had even been a word document up with the following words typed out when he had woken up in the morning. It sent chills up his spine.\n\n*You\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re sleeping.*\n\nOf course, he had no roommates to blame this on. He lived alone, and so it had to be either his own carelessness, or\u2026or\u2026\n____\nOne night he had been getting out of the shower and he thought he had seen a face outside of his window. He had screamed and slipped, banging his head on the dresser, and when he had woken up, he felt dazed and his head was pounding. The towel was neatly draped over his waist, and he had a pillow beneath his head.\n\n*What.in.the.actual.fuck.*\n\nThe face was slender, with full lips, long, shiny dark hair, and blue eyes. Freakishly blue eyes. Like ice. He started seeing her face everywhere. On the subway, in crowds on the street, he even thought he walked past her at work in the large lobby. He watched as she passed, dark hair swaying. She was a tiny thing, and she looked young and innocent. Sweet even. But there was a glint when their eyes had met for that brief millisecond. A knowing look she gave him before turning away. Was it the same woman? Was he just going insane? Should he call the police, or would they laugh him off as crazy?\n\nHe had nudged his friend and coworker as they headed out for lunch.\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d John had asked, craning his neck to where he was gesturing. He could just spot the girl\u2019s retreating figure, the subtle sway of her hips and her petite, svelte frame, heels, and conservative black suit.\n\n\u201cThe one in black!\u201d He said desperately, feeling a cold sweat begin.\n\n\u201cNo idea. She\u2019s hot, though. Maybe she\u2019s new. Maybe she works at that firm on the second level?\u201d\n\nHe nodded distractedly, but he thought he knew differently. It was the girl. It had to be her. He had been seeing her for months. She had even taken up residence in his dreams\u2026no wait, his nightmares.\n\nTime passed, and she slowly faded away. He hadn\u2019t seen her in a week. He began to relax again, began to enjoy life once more. He had slept horribly the previous night, and woken up groggy. It was a Friday, and he was excited to just relax at home after work that evening, to play video games and order pizza and forget about the world.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t get out until late, and it was already dark outside. Cursing his luck, he headed out to his car, the only lights illuminating the way the lights from the parking lot. He got into the car and realized the battery was dead. He had one of those emergency battery kits in his trunk, so he got out to look for it.\n\nPopping the trunk, he began to rifle around, cursing again when he couldn\u2019t find it.\n\nSuddenly, he stood when he felt a sharp pinch in his neck, a sting, seeing something from the corner of his eye, a flash of dark hair, blue eyes, the whispered words:\n\n\"I love you\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026\"\n\nAnd before he could even fight, he slumped forward into the trunk, lifeless to the world.\n________\nHe woke up dazed, blinking as he took in the cinderblock walls, his breath coming in terrified gasps as he the memories began to filter back to him through his scrambled thoughts. He was completely tied to a twin bed and appeared to be in a basement. Now, he knew he was fucked.\n\n(I don't want to hurt you...I just want to make you love me. And make no mistake...I will make you love me, no matter how much you scream)",

The only reason cats are submissive to humans at all is because we are fifteen times their size. Cats are *predators*. So when you put cat into a human, why wouldn't she have a razor's edge to her?\n\nThe same goes for several others. Kitsune? Foxes can be pretty vicious, and they're natural tricksters. Elves? They're masters of magic, and even the ones that aren't can put an arrow in you from miles away. So you've got a gun/know martial arts/can bench press a refrigerator. Big deal. I can kill you with my brain.\n\nI don't quite have a scene for this, just the character idea. I'm open to playing any mythical, at least partly humanoid creature as anything from playful to cruel. You can be her favorite toy or her prey.\n\n[Check out what I'm into.](https://i.imgur.com/pJxUALd.png) *Nya!*",

My name's Jessie, thank you for clicking on my post!\n\nI've had a frankly terrible week, involving one of my coworkers ruining a piece of hardware and proceeding to give me the flu, so I decided that the best way to help myself recover from a long, stressful, medicine-filled week was to post here on /r/dpp!\n\nI've been GM-ing for a long time now, I started way back when I was a teenager, and I'd like to think I'm a competent writer! As such, I'd like to run one of you lucky guys (or girls, I'm bi so I like everybody!) through my homebrewed and handcrafted world of Grenia. As you journey through my world, you will find a colorful cast of characters to befriend, battle, and bed, each with their own distinct personality, likes/dislikes, relationships, and sidequests for you to enjoy!\n\nNow your part: I'd like to have more than one or two lines to work with in your response. I'm not gonna ask for an essay to open a door, but I'd like a little bit more than, \"I stab the bandit in the throat.\" It's easier for both of us that way! Also, please don't be overtly edgy or stupid. \n\nFor my kinks, I enjoy cum, domination, interracial (normal and fantasy), bondage, dirty talk, lingerie, and humiliation! For my limits, I refuse to write anything involving the restroom, underage people, or dying. \n\nAs a quick disclaimer, **this will not be \"go here, fuck this girl with pointy ears, rinse and repeat.** There will be actual story, character development, combat, heroism, tragedy, beauty, horror, and more for you to enjoy! In addition, **please do not message me with only one sentence. I want to get to know you a bit, so that I know what would be good to throw at you!**\n\nI hope to hear from you soon, thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "For Men playing PUBG, the 'scariest' parts of PUBG are the very beginning when you land and you are vulnerable for equipment, and the very end where you are in a life-and-death struggle with enemies who all have high-powered sniper rifles. \n\nFor women, it's different. For a woman, especially without a squad, the *Mid-Game* is the scariest part. The sound of a Kar98 firing at you is scary, but it's nothing compared to hearing someone rack a shotgun shell behind you, and say \"Strip\"\n\nThis is why I always play in squads. There is safety in numbers, and your attackers won't have a chance to *enjoy* you while you have friends providing cover fire.\n\nBut being the last survivor of a squad, on an island full of men about to die, and desperate for one last pussy to crush before an eternity of oblivion? Well. That's another situation...\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHey there everyone! In case it's not obvious, ~~I'm really into PUBG~~ I'm trying to find a roleplay based loosely off of the very popular video game. I love the idea of being raped at gunpoint, and adding another edge of excitement and terror to an already nerve-wracking game. \n\nAs per my normal *Modus Operandi* I don't have a \"set\" way how this should play out, but it should follow the themes that I have attempted to set up in this post~\n\nI'm looking forward to your little Ginger envelopes &lt;3",

They aren't really friends, but my ex-boyfriend was talking a lot of shit to my boyfriend about the Super Bowl. My boyfriend and I are huge Patriot fans, and my ex is from Wilkes-Barre so he's a big Eagles fan.  \n\nThe bet was if the Patriots won my ex had to never talk to me or my friends again (he always tries to flirt with us which my boyfriend was annoyed by), and if the Eagles won I had to do whatever my ex wanted for a whole day. Well, we lost obviously.  \n\nI spent the next day having sex with my ex and having him humiliate me in front of his friends. Spanked, stripped naked, and cummed on in front of his guy friends. Many I had been friends with when we dated. My ex did everything he could from anal to foot jobs. I really didn't enjoy that it was him and his friends who were having their way with me, but I don't back out of anything. I didn't tell my boyfriend what happened because he didn't want to know. I can go into more details or answer any questions if anyone wants to talk about it.",

            "selftext": "Slurp. Slurp. Suck.\n\nYou're not sure how it started, of all the rumours you've ever heard anyone starting this was definitely the weirdest one. You didn't even believe it yourself, but apparently the pretty, little, blonde 18 year old currently kneeling between your knees and sucking your cock extra slow believed it. The craziest part is this girl told you she was a virgin. Sorry, that's not doing the story justice. She apologized for being a virgin, and then asked if it was still okay if she gives it a try with her mouth.\n\nOf course the moment you looked her tiny little body up and down, you knew you had no problem with her asking to suck your cock. She looked like a young Taylor Swift, perky tits, tight ass, and plump, cherry red lips, wrapped tightly around your cock.\n\nSlurp. Slurp. Suck.\n\nShe moaned softly as she looked up at you with her big blue eyes, her small tongue twirling itself around the head of your cock as her plump red lips suckled on your tip for a moment before sliding the length of your shaft back into her mouth. She gagged softly when you hit the back of her throat but even her gags were kind of cute. As cute as this girl was, and as amazing as this slow, soft, cocksucking felt, it was just another one of many incredulous moments that have happened to you over the past month.\n\nThere was that gorgeous southern belle that begged you to fuck her ass, the busty asian girl that begged you to fuck her tits until you came all over her face, and of course those two sorority sisters who took turns riding your cock until you came a load thick enough for the both of this. Just thinking about all these moments was driving you wild and you were ready to burst.\n\nSlurp. Slurp. Suck. Gag. Cough, cough.\n\nYou shoot a heavy, thick, load into the petite blonde's mouth. Her big blue eyes go wide and watery but she makes sure to swallow every last drop. As she finishes she wipes her mouth clean and smiles the biggest, widest smile you've ever seen.\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" She says and practically jumps into your arms for a hug. She holds this hug for surprisingly long before getting up and walking out of your dorm room. As she does so you notice she had a friend waiting outside for her.\n\n\"So did you do it?\"\n\n\"Of course I did it! I sucked his cock.\"\n\n\"Ohmygod Amy, you can't just suck his cock. It only works if he fucks you.\"\n\n\"Not true, my friend Katie sucked his cock and got hired at Google the next day.\"\n\n\"Yeah well this girl in my Philosophy class let him fuck her from behind and she won a two million dollar slot machine jackpot a week later.\"\n\n\"Ok, well if I audition and don't get this role, then I'll let him fuck me.\"\n\nYou listen to their voices fade away and start to fix your pants when you notice another girl standing in the doorway looking at you. Shyly, she begins to speak.\n\n\"Hey... are you the guy with the lucky cum?\"\n\n------\n\nAs always, I love guys who include pictures of the girls they want me to be! Don't be lazy with your replies, if this prompt is still up then yes I am still looking for a partner. No I will not give you kik or any other sort social media of mine.",

            "selftext": "Wrapping herself around a well-muscled arm, Lauren stepped closer to the man next to her, letting her head rest on his shoulder as they walked. Wearing a small smile on her soft, glossy pink lips, the slim 22-year-old was clad in a suggestive little black dress.\n\nShort and clingy, it was the perfect piece to showcase her tight, developed body. Flirty shoulder straps gently sinking into pale, lotion-smooth skin, the stretchy dress seemed to accentuate her every curve; holding up the shelf of a stunning bust - 32C breasts sumptuously on partial display in the dipping, generous cleavage-producing sweetheart neckline; snugly contouring around her thin, narrow waist and flat stomach; curving into and hugging her slender, flaring hips; encasing her pert, shapely ass; the hemline stopping daringly high on her creamy thighs, further showing off long, slender, oh so smooth bare legs...\n\nSultry black stiletto heels only completed the tempting package, making the relatively tall beauty even more distracting. Audibly clicking against the solid ground with every step, the shoes seemed to announce her presence from afar. Even the simple, routine act of walking created a hypnotizing visual, of straight, gorgeously yellow blonde locks lightly dancing about a svelte neck, of subtly, noticeably bouncing breasts, of taut, shifting fabric, of swaying hip and ass, of tapering, tantalizing legs in motion.\n\nComplementing the treat was up top, at neatly parted bangs draped over her refined forehead, nearly touching pencil thin eyebrows. The attractive, well-proportioned face just below, where decorated with smokey shades brilliant light blue eyes sparkled like sapphires between the bridge of a sharp nose and high, delicate cheeks glowed magically, was equally arresting. \n\nLauren's partner, of course, had the best position.\n\nFrom a great view down the low-cut dress that clung to her frame, at the sight of two ample, firm globes, snug and bulging in their confines of top-open dress and supportive bra underneath - feminine semi-spheres secure in hidden clam shell cups, seductively full, supple, perky, and wonderfully round-shaped - to being able to inhale her freshly showered scent of designer shampoo and conditioner, and body wash; sensual personal care products of an alluring blend of floral and perfumed body fragrances, to getting the most closeup look at her sleek flaxen locks and heartmelting face, he was the prime beneficiary of her laborious, diligent effort getting ready, teased hair, perfect makeup and all.\n\nTonight was all about him in fact. The result of over two hours of preparation, each and every detail of her appearance was carefully, consciously chosen, in alignment with her man's expressed preferences. Who was he, in his early 30s - a decade older than her - eliciting such high consideration from the blonde? \n\nIn brief, a provider of sorts. Far from unheard of, it was pretty well-known by now. Pretty girl glams herself up and goes on dates with a successful older man, in exchange for much needed cash. As an attractive, financially-struggling college girl, she fit the bill to a tee, much as she hesitated to admit. More candidly, he was her \"sugardaddy\".\n\n*Ugh.*\n\nAs her meticulously lacquered nails, painted bright red, dug slightly into his expensive jacket, Lauren twitched reflexively at the word. She hated to use that term, even just in her own head. It sounded so trashy, so mortifyingly indicative of any girl willfully in such a compensation-for-companionship agreement having given a slutty okay to use her sex appeal for male entertainment and pleasure.\n\nYet, whatever it was called, there was no denying that's what this relationship was. The wealthy, impressive guy whose right arm she'd attached herself to and was dangling off of? They'd met via a website focused exclusively on the topic: a discreet online platform providing an avenue to match single, invariably very-appreciative-of-the-opposite-sex older guys who had excess funds to spend with young, good-looking girls who were either hard up for cash or after a free, easy ride.\n\nDespite the awkward situation, Lauren prided herself in being the former. She wasn't looking to be showered with gifts or to live a life of luxury, even if that's what she was ending up getting a little taste of. With a smart mind and a promising future ahead of her, all she was after was a little bit of extra money - a few hundred more a month - to help make ends meet in the city. That the guy offered several times that? Frankly, it was a huge surprise, though not an unwelcome one. And, well, long story short, she wasn't going to turn the opportunity down.\n\nGranted, part of her still couldn't believe the situation. If anyone had told her a few months ago that she'd be doing this, she wouldn't have believed them. It was unimaginable, so unlike her. But a few financial difficulties here and there had a way of changing one's perspective.\n\nThat said, Lauren was very careful about everything, making sure to set mutually agreed upon limits of behavior and expectations from the very beginning - No kissing. No going back to his place. No sex. She was selling some of her time and company, *not* her body. Thankfully he'd assented, with surprisingly little protest.\n\nOf course, to seal the contract, that meant she had to agree to a trio of terms of his own: The right to communicate over phone instead of just through the website's messaging system or email. At least two dates a week. Indulging him in his preferred fashion for her whenever they were together (he'd generously offered stipends for clothing and cosmetics, above and beyond the ordinary twice-a-month payments).\n\nIt was the last one, a requirement she'd dubbed as \"dress up\" that really stood out. Going into very personal, intimate territory, she could recall how surreal it felt to read a detailed list of what he wanted to see on her. Mind you, the stuff wasn't shocking; no girl would have been surprised to discover guys liked revealing attire. Indeed, the eye-rolling lines about \"flattering tops\" (defined as having to at least be one of the three of sleeveless, form-fitting, or low-cut), tiny shorts, short skirts, tight dresses, and skimpy underwear was pretty much expected. It was how in-depth it went, though, that caught her by surprise. Going down into the finer details of brands, fabric, and even preferred colors, that's when Lauren got the vague suspicion this guy was a little bit of a pervert.\n\nStill, she wasn't really in a position to object. Sure, she *could* have complained but, then, it was pretty conventional, all things considered; embarrassing, yes, but not enough to make her truly uncomfortable. And considering he *was* paying for it (both the clothes and the opportunity itself), she supposed it wasn't so unreasonable.\n\nShe'd even undergone a bit of self-discovery herself in the process. It wasn't just the weirdly pleasant feel of wearing clothes that accentuated her figure and showed a lot of skin, or push-up bras and thongs - provocative undergarment styles that she was far too self-conscious to wear in the past - slowly turning into her own favorites too. It was more than that. When she was out with him, she strangely found herself kind of *enjoying* the way she was turning heads, the way all the other men would be subtly (and not so subtly) checking her out, faces dawning grimaces of envy at the realization she wasn't available; found herself *liking* the light objectification, the tinge of exhibitionism and voyeurism, the playing eye-candy for him. It was somewhat controversial and taboo, but, for some reason that's exactly what made it so gripping, so exhilarating.\n\nNow, Lauren didn't exactly have a favorable view of the truer circumstance. Flaunting herself for him, at his encouragement, and he in return happily parading her around and showing her off, as the fruits of his labor and support. It clashed a little with her modern, progressive and egalitarian beliefs but, at the same time, she couldn't deny there was something oddly satisfying about it. Being this ego-boosting, jealously-stoking *status symbol*, it was just such an incredible rush. It made her feel so sexy and desirable, like she was the only, most attractive, most important, and most coveted girl in the room; as if she was this powerful, noteworthy bombshell. Though it was *his* stature and reputation being enhanced by her dolled up, bordering on scantily-clad company, it was vainly equally fulfilling for her.\n\nA senior in university, she was single (though not due to a lack of would-be suitors; so busy with her studies, she simply hadn't made the time in her life for a boyfriend) and, compared to those idyllic cafe dates with a sweet guy she'd oft fantasize about, being taken out, whether in private or to more public social events, by a fairly possessive guy she had to pretend she was actually going out with, was proving to be just a little bit more naughty and exciting. \n\nOn that note, she'd be lying if she hadn't said part of the reason that, out of all of those messages filling her inbox, she responded to his in particular was because he was the best looking. Tall, handsome, in great shape, just the picture of choice masculinity, he hit those checkboxes of positive physical attributes. But Lauren told herself that was just a harmless, innocent inclination; if she was going to be spending a lot of time with a guy, might as well go with one that was easy on the eyes, right? Her selection didn't speak to any salient, actionable attraction. \n\nSame with that extraneous engaging in some playful texting every now and then with him (in contrast, he always called when he wanted to set up a date), along with sending him sexy selfies on occasion when he asked for them - those things were merely platonic responding to his attentive interest, just a little extra \"service\" to keep him happy. They didn't mean anything in terms of chemistry, feelings for, or receptiveness to, him. Really.\n\nAnd that heavy sexual tension that seemed to constantly spring up in the air when she was with him in person? The butterflies she'd get in her stomach when he flirted with her, daring to get a bit touchy and/or make flattering, blush-inducing compliments? Those dreamy thoughts she started having of him even when they weren't together? Lauren was sure they had to be normal, arguably expected even, what with the amorous context. After all, despite the sexual and romantic undertones, this was, at its core, just a temporary, mutually-beneficial business arrangement.\n\nHonestly, there was nothing to worry about; it's not like she was falling for him.\n\n...Right?\n\n----\n\nSo I feel the setup is pretty self-evident in the desired plot but it never hurts to be clear: I'm envisioning this unexpectedly getting quite a bit more steamy and serious than our girl here ever imagined. What's more, I absolutely adore the idea of this development being something the guy was intentionally aiming for from the start, from the very moment he laid eyes on her profile - secretly hatching up a scheming plan to charm his way into this gorgeous little thing's panties and make her his, that devilish, hedonistic goal and mate choice already privately decided when he sent that first message. I love men in driven, predetermined pursuit - it's so hot.\n\nPlease don't contact me if you're intending something abusive or demeaning; I have no interest in humiliation, domination, petplay, slavery, or the like. Inconsiderateness or nastiness is emphatically *not* a wanted kink. I'm looking to roleplay a story of **seduction**. Classy and sophisticated is so much better a turn-on, way more erotic than anything crude or creepy. I hope to find a writing partner who shares that belief and enjoyment.",

Taking parties or single people to the iddilic places deep beneath the sea level \n\nOther such amusements were handled by people like [Priya](https://i.imgur.com/gQKbbiR.png) whom often acted as a chaperone for the rich and famous, offering tours and other such things for those with the wallet to pay for them. But not sex, that wasn't on the table. She was married, and not some form of slut was she? \n\nAdditional talent such as the wonderful [Sophie ](https://i.imgur.com/w8LYvnN_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) worked part time at the beach as a lifeguard while at College, eager to finish her studies in boobology. The science of why people have big boobs of course. *Duh*. \n\nAnd finally, a profession unique to Milfville was the milk maid, and [Maserati](https://i.imgur.com/ja9qkt3.png) was known to be the best. Bringing her udders straight to whomever paid the fees for her milk, straight from the source. \n\nKinks: BBC, humongous cocks, groups, gangbangs, cumplay, huge loads, lactation, cheating, humiliation, impregnation, massages, seduction, reluctant cheating, cuckolding\n\nLimits: ageplay and beasts\n\nAll kinks are negotiable so feel free to suggest some, or remove some!",

Maybe you tear just the right spots to show off my pussy or maybe you cover it with cum before hand and make me wear it. Maybe its slutty from design where you have just the right parts be transparent to show off my embarassing parts. So many ideas! I would love to chat about them and I would love pictures.\n\nBesides that I want to know what clothes you would make me wear before you fuck me. Im talking real slutwear like super short skirts, crotchless panties or maybe bodysuits and fishnets. Something that is designed to be so fuckable that you wouldnt be able to resist bending me over and having your way with me. In addition recently I have a thing for latex slutwear. Like full body suits that are open where it matters. Maybe it's a themed suit and I have to wear a mask thst makes me look like a plastic dolly. Or maybe it's a fursuit and you're going to make me your breeding bitch.\n\nFor reference before anyone asks Im a small Asian girl about 5 feet in height. I have black silky hair down to my waist and a petite figure.",

I sat in my bridal suite, wearing an elegant white dress, looking about as beautiful as I had ever looked. My makeup was perfect so was the dress. I was excited, I would be financially secure for life, even if I did have to marry a man who didn't satisfy all of my needs, I wouldn't have to work another day in my life, and that was worth it. Besides, I already had someone to play that part for me.\n\nI met you way earlier, when we were in college. You had a decent job, enough to make ends meet at your apartment, and we had a bit of thing going on. You may not have much materially, but man did you know how to make a girl feel like a woman. You were incredible in bed, dominant and satisfying, anything a girl could ask for. Even after we broke up, I missed your cock so much, I needed it. One night after fucking my soon to be husband. I was left so unsatisfied that I texted you for the first time in about a year. It worked. Pretty soon we had an affair going on,  you fucked me behind my fianc\u00e9's back, and I loved it. I was addicted to you. And it showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nYou made your way up to my wedding suite. I wasn't planning on having any fun with you so close to my ceremony, but that's irrelevant. What you want, I have to give. That's part of our arrangement. And right now, you feel like filling my womb with your seed, making sure it's deep inside of you as I walk down the aisle. Not only that, you want to do me in my wedding dress. I'm not about to become my fianc\u00e9's woman, I'll never be as long as you're here. I'm yours. ",

I can't tell you I love you, I can't tell you I need you, because then.. what if it ends?\n\nAll feelings aside, tonight is your birthday. You, me, my friends and yours, all out celebrating. Sounds awesome.. right? Of course, I come late, my auburn hair curled to perfection, my red dress showing off every last curve on my petite body. My red lips drawn perfectly and my light blue eyes sparkling. We're both single, so I was excited. Tonight we could get drunk and anything could happen, and we would wake up in the morning and forget..\n\nBut I walk in and see your arm wrapped around some bimbo, you both laughing and smiling at each other. I never minded it, but gosh it struck a fucking nerve. I couldn't handle it. I run out, tears in my eyes, and sit on the curb.

I\u2019m into intelligence. If you can\u2019t string together a sentence better than \u201chey wanna fuck \u201c I don\u2019t really think we are going to click. I like professional, driven, artistic sorts. Humor is a huge plus in my book. Someone who doesn\u2019t expect an answer right away because real life exists and they get the demands of that. I don\u2019t want to role play but I am absolutely ok with getting down and dirty in a few different ways. Just, after we\u2019ve talked some you know? Is chatting even a thing now? Am I that old? \n\nI won\u2019t lie, physical attraction is important to me. So if we get to that point of pics and whatnot id like to know you\u2019re someone who takes care of themselves.\n\nI can promise to be witty and sarcastic.

            "selftext": "Welcome to the year 2024. We don't have flying cars yet, and we haven't found a cure for cancer. But you know what we do have? Catgirls!\n\nBy genetic discoveries of scientists, it has been found that cats and women have very similar DNA structures. Breeding them produces a cat/human hybrid. It's very common for girls to be produced from breeding, but it is possible to breed a male (though very rare). \n\nThe market for catgirls exploded seemingly overnight. However as expected, the price for such a companion is quite high. They aren't commonly found unless you're fairly well off.\n\nIf you do happen to own one of these amazing friends, there is some care you must take into consideration to ensure your catgirl lives a long, happy, and healthy life. Here's a standard issue required handbook for any owner looking to purchase a catgirl: https://catgirlcare.org/\n\n~\n\nYou're a busy executive for Tycoware, the world's leading computer hardware developer. You live in a high-rise penthouse, and are constantly swamped with work. You don't have much of a social life, and frankly you feel alone and depressed. That is, until you find a [stray catgirl](https://i.imgur.com/ME9t6R2.jpg) in an alley. You decide to take the catgirl in, allowing her to become your companion, friend, and maybe something more. \n\n*Notes: I think it'd be cute to include a romance aspect in here, but that's entirely optional. Your catgirl could just be your cute, gorgeous little friend. :)*\n\n~ \n\nHello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is quite closely based on the website that I linked above. I thought it was so cute, and the idea of being a catgirl really excited me. I'd really appreciate it if you skimmed through the website, as it's rather important for this roleplay. However, you don't have to. It's basically how I want my character to act, sort of on the cat side of the human - cat ratio if that makes sense. \n\nI have plenty a kink, as evidenced [here.](https://i.imgur.com/JOcL49z.png) For this, I'd love to focus on some sort of cumplay, cock worship, and cuddling (does that count as a kink?). However, I don't want this to be solely based on smut. \n\nSo yeah! Feel free to send any questions my way. Don't worry, I don't bite. I'm looking forward to hearing from all of you!\n\nXOXO \n\n- Lizzy\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I walk through the halls of my own personal kennel, smiling at the sounds of puppies and petboys. Barking, straining at their leashes, humping the floor frantically in their chastity cages. All begging for the attention of their Mistress. \n\nEach cell is fairly small, very like a kennel, but for submissive human boypets. Cement marks each one with metal grilles in the front, with space at the bottom to shove in dog-bowls of food and water. I have a few \"human pets\" with a little bit more authority taking care of the dogs for me; a Mistress should not have to get her hands dirty unless she so desires. The human pets wear chastity cages too, and though their hands are free, unlike the dogs, they know the price of disobedience. Some of those chastity cages are soldered on. Permanently. \n\nBut my puppies are my pride. I go over to one of the cages and unlock it, smiling down at the lucky boy inside. \"Who's a lucky boy today??\" I ask, grinning as you bark and pant, sticking your tongue out. So well trained. \"That's right darling! Out we go!\" I let you out into the hallway and hold up my hand, saying a command. We go through \"Up\" \"roll over\" \"lick\" and \"paw\", until finally I have you lay on your back in stocks soldered to the cement floor. Once your hands and feet are bound, I finally, slowly, painfully slowly, I remove your chastity cage. I smile and start to gently rub you with my gloved hand, grinning as you howl.\n\n\"There's my good boy...there's my good sweet puppy...\" once I see you are about to cum I stop, and snap my fingers. One of the human pets brings over ice and packs your dick in the ice until you're flaccid enough to cage again; I kiss your whimpering cheek, leaving a hint of my lipstick there.\n\n\"Good boy,\" I murmur in your ear. \"You were so good for Mistress today. Maybe I'll let you cum at Christmas.\"\n\nI lead you back to your cell, smiling at your sweet whimpers, and move to the next puppy. I sit on a chair and make him hump my boot without using his hands, over and over, grinning as he gets close. I ask him if he wants to beg in \"people words\" and he agrees. \"Oh please Mistress oh god Mistress you haven't let me c-cum for two years oh god please....\" I smile and pat his cheek.\n\n\"No. Good boy. Good begging. Mistress is very pleased. Back in your cage.\" \n\nEach puppy gets individual attention from Mistress, and each puppy gets denied orgasm until all of my lovely dogs are back in their cages, with their chew-toys and their ropes, hands in leather mitts, chastity cages on. I stand in the middle of the kennels and clap my hands once for attention.\n\n\"Who wants to lick Mistress to orgasm?\" I call out, and grin at the resulting din. It's always good to spend time with your pets. \n\n------------\n\n(I would like to play out this scenario in a multitude of ways. Who would you like to be in my kennel? Would you like to be one of the human slaves, who takes care of the dogs, and fixes me a drink when I get home, and massages my feet? Would you like to be one of my puppies? Do you want to be the puppy that learns tricks? The puppy who humps my boot? The puppy who is in disgrace and isn't allowed even out of his cell to play with Mistress, or the puppy I make an example of and discipline in front of everyone? Would you like to be the lucky puppy who I pick to lick me to orgasm and cuddle with me on the couch upstairs in the nice warm living room (it's cool in the kennel on your naked skin, I'm sure) and watch a movie for a night? Such a lucky puppy, getting cuddle time with Mistress Sarah! \n\nMessage me with your age and who you'd like to be in the roleplay, just go ahead and start out as the person you'd want to be and we'll take it from there! :D Also include specific things you'd like to include - specific teases and torments you'd enjoy or deserve as a good or a bad puppy? :D) \n\nEDIT: Okay boys. Your responses *must* include you starting the roleplay; I've written quite a lot above and I want you to show me what you can do. I expect at *least* four sentences, and preferably more, in your starter. \n\nEDIT 2: Oh my goodness. Gold?? Thank you so much, wonderful benefactor!! I'm so glad my writing strikes a chord in so many people. I keep meaning to start up a Patreon or something with this. Thank you very very much, I'm very touched. Mistress Sarah is pleased. ;) ",

            "selftext": "You must have *really* done something bad to your ex girlfriend, little brother. I mean, this has to be the worst of the worst for what she's done to you in vengeance. I can only assume you cheated on her, broke her heart, ruined her emotionally... because hell hath no fury, as they say, like a woman's scorn. And her scorn is *scorching*.\n\nIt's a Sunday morning when she confesses she wants to try a 'bondage game' with you. Unusual, considering she's never mentioned that as a kink before, but you go along with it anyway. She puts you in a latex hood. It's got meshy eye patches so you can vaguely see out, but onlookers can't really see *in*. It's got buckles and a built-in collar to keep you in place. And, lastly, it's got a thick rubber plug that inserts into your mouth, shutting you up and clipping firmly into place. The whole thing is very... tight.\n\nOnce you're helplessly hooded, she puts a leash on you and takes you out to the car, forcing you inside. It's not like you can complain, only send out a series of muffled grunts. You're driven across town, to the outskirts, to a building with a sign hung over it reading: 'Allison's House of Domination'. Wait... Allison? That can't be...\n\nIt is. It's me, your older sister. I do this for a living. And now your very angry and vengeful soon-to-be-ex girlfriend is delivering you to me. She grabs your leash and yanks you out of the car and you're forced to pathetically stumble along as she hands you over. I'm waiting at the door, tall, blond, leggy, and very sadistic when provoked. \n\nI can't see your face. I have *no* idea you're my brother. I read over your info sheet, the one your twisted girlfriend typed up. \"Hmm. You don't want the hood or gag removed for the next 48 hours? That's a little weird, but okay. And, wait. You don't want a safe word or safe noise either? You get off on acting like you 'don't like this'?\" I frown, this all being very untypical, but... your payment already came through (the GF used *your* credit card) and I can't turn away a customer. With a roll of my eyes, I take your leash. \n\n\"Alright, you fucking worthless loser. Let's go. And keep that mouth *shut*.\" I rip hard at your leash, choking you a bit as I pull you along behind me, my butt gorgeous lifted by my 5 inch high heels, framed by leather pants. \n\nIt's going to be a *long* 48 hours for you, I think.\n\n***\n\nKinks: Torturing and humiliating you. Anything else you want to add, you'll have to tell me.\n\nLimits: Scat, ageplay, beastiality.",

Fingers rubbing and scratching my leaking pussy. \n\n\"Mmnngh, fuck, I need a cock.\" I whispered. I was in a skirt with a white blouse that showed a window of my cleavage; juicy plump ass and perfect sized breasts. Long blonde hair flowing, pale smooth skin, and outstanding green eyes. \n\nI want my husband to fuck me and cum in me, but he's away... I don't think I can wait, any cock will do at this point. A cock to mark the inside of my pussy.\n\n*Invade and mark your territory in this married pussy.*\n\n(( That horny time again~!

Though I suppose that **technically** you did get away with it. After all there you were on the television screen, smiling at me from the evening news as you stand next to the lawyer you had hired for your appeal, the lawyer who had taken my place as your counsel. \n\nI stand up and tug at the sleeve of my sweat shirt as it hangs off of my shoulder as I turn to walk back to the kitchen to refill my glass. Stretching out my black legging clad legs as I walk. My bare feet silent on the hardwood floor of the cabin. I wasn't usually one to choose to spend my vacation time hiding out in a cabin in the middle of the woods, but it had seemed like a good idea. I felt safer being alone where no one knew where I was. \n\nI turn back to the TV as you say that you are happy that justice has been served and that you had been cleared of all charges. \"But at least people know what you had been accused of, there is suspicion... your name is no longer squeaky clean\" I mutter under my breath as I sit down on the couch and drink of my wine once more. I hadn't wanted to represent you, but you and the firm had felt that having a woman as your lawyer would look good on you. \n\nBut I hadn't been able to bring myself to get you off. So I hadn't used the most powerful piece of evidence, I had held it back, stating that I felt that we would not need it. And you had been found guilty. But of course you had appealed before you had even spent a night in jail. And your new lawyer hadn't felt bad at all about the nature of your offense, he had gladly used the vital evidence and gotten you cleared. I had faked shame and ignorance and even taken some vacation time in order to 'get over my disappointment'. But I know you were not fooled. You knew what I had done and why. But the question remains would you do anything about it? \n\ntl;dr - I am a lawyer who had thrown your case and then went into hiding. After your new lawyer gets you cleared and freed you come to seek your revenge. \n\nDPP [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5b1bt8/34_f_amberbriz/) ",

            "selftext": "I whimper softly and close my eyes, shuddering just a moment as I can feel my cold hands slide under the fabric of my panties. I can already feel the dampness as the fabric clings to my wet lips. A muffled gasp and a movement of my hips, my clit slowly being teased by a finger. I arch my back upwards, slowly moving two fingers down the wet slit and circling the  entrance of my tight pussy.\n\nOne finger slides in effortlessly, pumping itself in and out before feeling pressure build as another finger slides in, spreading my walls just a bit before tightening against my two fingers. I groan softly as I slide in and out, making sure that the palm of my hand can nudge against my clit just right. Faster and faster, I buckle my hips as I try bury my face into the sheets of my bed. I don't want to make to much noise, but god it's so hard once I get going.\n\nNo matter how good this always feels, it always feels me with some sadness...\n\nI pant softly, finding myself on my knees and my face buried in the sheets as I slump forward, moaning and feeling the walls of my wet cunt twitch and spasm against my fingers as I cum. I muster enough will to not moan, before long I'm just lying there breathing hard as I try to just relax. \n\nMy room is still dark, dawn still hasn't come yet. I guess that's a record for me, but still I don't have to rush today at least. I turn over on to my back and close my eyes for a moment. \n\nThe small apartment is quiet, except for the faint *clicking* of my trusted dog's nails on the wooden floor outside of the room. I sigh softly and decide to get ready, pushing myself off the bed and heading to the shower. Once that's done I grab discarded clothes that are at the foot of the mirror in my room. I look at myself for a moment as I stand there naked and feeling vulnerable. Brown skin, dark brown nipples,  faint scars that run down my arms and legs, a large scar on my back... imperfections. One of the reasons I don't sleep with anyone. That and I guess not a lot of people find my 32A chest all that attractive.\n\nMy eyes also seem to creep people out, my left eye a silvery white colour and my right one is a green colour. To be honest it was from a failed experiment that discoloured my eyes. I start to put on my clothes and before long I find myself dressed, pushing my long white hair a bit. Small elfish ears hide under my hair....\n\nI was a failed experiment to begin with.\n\nNow I just take small odd jobs here and there on my own. Sometimes if I'm lucky old contacts will be give work that none of their guys want to do (but that's rare now). I never was considered a full fledged demon hunter, since I didn't pass the test... it almost killed me. Still having had the training and being a witch by nature still gives me an advantage. But the side-effects haven't left much, not to mention the other stuff... sensations and my own feelings can be too much for me, which is why some mornings I have to take care of my own needs. Haven't really seen anyone from those days really... I thought we used to be good friends in the small group.\n\nI sigh softly and get breakfast out of the way, making my way to my 'office' that's next door, it's connected with a hallway that appears invisible to everyone. It makes it easier for me to go to and fro. I open the door on the other side and pull open the curtains, turning on the 'open' light and just start to tidy the place up a bit, making sure to cast a protective charm on the door I just stepped out of. If anyone that isn't me ever wandered in, it would just lead to a bathroom.\n\nMy dog accompanies me and sits under the round table that's in the middle of the room. He's been my faithful companion, always protecting me from harm. Then again he is a grimme, a black dog with red eyes that usually is a death omen. He's been with me since I was a kid, a gift from my mom. He's pushing past 20 now and still doesn't look a day over 5 years old.\n\nIt seems really silly but whenever a client comes in I always think maybe they'll sweep my off my feet, even if it's just for one night. Honestly I'm not picky. If my clients are supernatural monsters in disguise it makes it hard to concentrate some of the time, something about being taken by a beast just makes me want to spread my legs. It could just be their natural pheromones.\n\nI never know who will step through those doors, maybe someone from my past or maybe someone who could make the pain of a lonely night go away.\n\nStill... It'd be nice to maybe find some romance.\n\n-----\n\nA witch looking for some love, I just need someone to be her client. Any gender goes, I'm not picky.\n\nI know a lot of you are always eager but please hold off on starting the rp. I'd like for you to give me a character description and a background story! That way we can sort of talk details before hand and do a little bit of world building. Also to make sure you've read this type 'supernatural romance' as a header for the PM, otherwise I won't be responding.\n\nTurn on: demons, werewolves, monsters, knotting, bestiality, futa, cum, big boobs, lesbians, big dicks, multi-dicks, oral (giving and receiving) cuddling, kissing, hand holding, saying I love you\n\nTurn offs: feet, scat, gore, vore, violence/blood, watersport, anal\n\nThanks for reading!",

That might be an exaggeration actually since I'm sure I would regret some of the things I fantasized about, but I nonetheless want to start my day off by talking dirty with an older man. If we get along great, it doesn't even have to be for just today either! If that's the case, we could exchange pictures too but I don't care either way. I used to RP a lot (not the erotic kind but still!) but not so anymore. I just want to have a fun chat, where we're acting nasty and exploring one another's dirty minds. True dirty penpals basically.\n\nI am a humungous five feet tall with an impressive 100-ish pounds, long dark hair, light-white skin and green eyes. You'll have to ask if you want to know any *other* measurements.\n\nI am understandably not that experienced but I still have kinks (and maybe you'll help me find more I like): older men, cunnilingus, lots of yummy cum, cuddling (\ud83d\udc98), clothed sex, dirty talk, loving sex, kissing and caressing, and a more dominant partner. Among my limits: anything involving bathroom stuff, blood, or pain! Only thing I ask is your age and what I should call you in the title of your message.\n\nEdit: Thank you, everyone, for the responses and for wishing me a happy birthday. Unfortunately, I was not able to reply to everyone and I apologize to those people, especially the ones who put lots of hard work into it! I just was not expecting many responses in the first place and got overwhelmed.",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Kaitlyn and I've been Roleplaying for about 5 years now. I have tons of fetishes and the only things that I don't like are scat and water sports. Everything else I'm happy to play with! Today I am looking for a girl or a guy who would be interested in starting long term roleplays, I have tons of ideas and I have a passion for this, feel free to message me if you're interested! Here's my current favourite idea, if you don\u2019t want to do this specific story we can do something else inside this bimbo world ;3\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIt\u2019s the year 2169, you and your mother have lived in the country your whole lives and you\u2019ve only heard rumours about the cities, you\u2019ve heard that in the cities girls are treated like objects and they love it, you\u2019ve heard that every woman wants to have massive features and look like a complete slut, no matter what age. You both ignore these rumours thinking they must be fake, it\u2019s too unlikely right? You are moving into the city tomorrow, it\u2019s cheaper and you need to go to an actual school, when you get there you find out the rumours are true, it\u2019s like every girl is brainwashed to be an objectified whore. Even your mother is wearing smaller tighter clothes.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn this roleplay I will be playing as all the men and women that you meet throughout the roleplay, your mother, your teachers, your friends, girls at school etc.. If you are female or enjoy gender-bender I will play the male character in the roleplay. I hope you liked my idea! The main fetishes that are almost always a must have with my roleplays are ageplay, incest, oversized body parts(like boobs, ass, lips etc..) and my most important fetish comes into play with this one because I get insanely turned on by words like massive, giant, huge etc.. I also love gender bender, cuckold and hypnotization as well as excessive amounts of cum or Precum or even spit, super tight clothes, sounds through text for example if I give a blowjob there would be SHLRRP sounds or something like that and I have plenty of more fetishes but we can discuss them. I'm mostly a submissive character in my roleplays but I can play Dom if you enjoy that type of thing. PM me and we can talk about ideas, where we can Roleplay and other things like that. If I don't reply tonight I probably fell asleep hehe :)",

AKA breastfeeding someone. \n\n\n\nI love it when someone equally enjoys the breastfeeding/sucking as much as I enjoy it. \n\n\n\nSo please: *come suck on my nipples*. \n\n\n\nYou can be my adult daughter/son, boyfriend/girlfriend, stranger, lover, some alien being. Whatever you are to me, I don\u2019t care. Just *suck* on my titties in great description. \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d, long honey brown hair, pale skin smattered with freckles, big green eyes framed by long eyelashes, a cute nose, plump red lips, and nice straight teeth. I\u2019m a 36DD, I have a narrow waist and voluptuous hips. My thighs are toned and I have a nice round ass. \n\n\n\nMy tits in better detail: They\u2019re pale and creamy, blue veins slightly visible. My nipples are a soft pink, and slightly small. However, when I\u2019ve got an eager mouth around, they quickly stiffen and elongate, presenting a perfect nipple for suckling. \n\n\n\nPlease let me know who you are to me, a physical description of yourself, and then join me in bed to get started on that nipple sucking.

            "selftext": "The first few are more full ideas then it kind of melts into a dumb ramble of what I think is hot. If you want to Rp with me I just ask a few things. Title your reply something related and unique. I get a lot of replies with the same title and it's easy to loose you in it. Tell me what prompt you like and why. And tell me what you'd like to change in the prompt. That's it!\n\nOlder brothers girlfriend - I kind of love the thought of accidentally being a brutal tease to my boyfriend's little brother. I'm 25 you're 18 and I'm just too hot to handle. We can play this a ton of ways. Big bro does you a solid and gives you a turn as a present. Maybe I take pity on you and give you a chance. Dare gone too far? 3 way? Sexual sharing?\n\nBabysitter- I'm babysitting your son for the night. Bright perky 18 year old girl in your home. Do I want you? Do you offer me extra cash to do you favors? Does your wife tease you and tell you to take a shot? I could be all kinds of girls here to. Nerdy, preppy, gothy all kinds of fun things.\n\nDating your Dad- much like the brother prompt but I'm dating your dad. And I'm half his age.\n\nThe table- I'm a regular at your DnD game and we hook up. This idea is really loose to help you drape what you like on it.\n\nIncest - bro sis. Mom and son. Daddy daughter? Sexy aunt? Let's keep it in the family.\n\nTeacher- you could be my student or my students father. Or we flip the genders. What kind of teacher do you like?\n\nSo everything else is less idea and more open concept. I love roles where we probably absolutely for real shouldn't fuck but we do anyway. I'm big into realism but I'm down for reailty play, like giving you a genie. But you really gotta prove you can earn that one. I'm ok with dubcon like being stripped or tied up. Coercion can be fun to like a cop offering to let me go if I just spreadem. Character building and teasing are huge turn ons for me. I'm open to prompts off list but you absolutely must have them well defined first. At least 80 percent of the way there. I'm into a whole lot of stuff that most people are not. My hard limits are pain, vore, blood, bathroom related anything, violence and inflation. If it's not on that list I'm probably willing to try it. Pm me please!",

That's what you're supposed to do right? Combine your interests in roleplay?\n\nAnyway, back on topic. I'd like to play in a high fantasy setting, how far along or backwards it is in the technology department has yet to be decided since I'd rather get a go ahead from a potential partner. \n\nThere's a *multitude* of different ideas to include and play, Queen x Servant, Noble x Street Vagrant, and many, *many* more that ice got swirling around in my messed up little noggin here! Yet, there is something important I should add before I move onto the *dirty* part. I want plot, I want my story to mean something, sex won't ever take priority over some good storytelling. Sex will still play a prominent role but, I'm human and I will probably steer it naturally torwards some sex.\n\nSpeaking of that, kinks; I have way too many. Limits; none whatsoever! That's right, no matter how depraved or kinky you are as long as you have decent writing capabilities and a creative boner I'll take you!\n\nIf you've read this far, congrats, if you want to message me and try something out *please* put 'Kitten' somewhere in your message along with your kinks, limits and facts about your writing style/length.",

            "selftext": "It had all started with a crazy bet, one that I had no idea I could actually lose.\n\nIt wasn't like our football team was any good in the first place, the Sunnydale High Centaurs were bottom of the league. And all the distraction they got from the cheerleaders, football mom's and even the coach's own wife didn't help them stay focused either.\n\nWe'll just say there's a reason the team is named after horse-men.\n\nSo [Tammy]( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0zpsjq2dU7E/Vsgy863h2RI/AAAAAAAAR7k/sqlBWy2vRLs/w1024-h768/VTa8l.jpg) and I started teasing them with the idea of a threesome, which quickly devolved into a competition, on the condition that they won the championship.\n\nWell they won the championship, and I was already sticky from the champagne, let alone the cum.\n\nI looked up at Ryan, the new wide receiver as he pulled his skinny cock out of his tight pants and pushed it into my face proudly. \"Come on [Mrs. Carol.]( https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics1/2017-03-22/406616_01big.jpg)\" He begged as I peeked at the line stretching into the locker room behind him, eager to get their turn with the coach's slutty wifey.\n\nI looked over at Tammy, who had two of the linesmen pounding her between them without mercy. The young, slutty cheerleader was certainly flexible, even if she couldn't beat me in experience.\n\n\"Yes! Yes! Fuck me harder Trevor!\" Tammy screamed. She'd been with half the team already (mostly the half I wasn't fucking myself) and it was her dream to have them here all at once. The hulking player groaned as he came inside the cheerleader's pussy, and I watched another point get chalked up for Tammy.\n\nScore: Tammy 5 Mrs. Carol 3. I felt Ryan grab my head roughly just as I looked up to the scoreboard. I knew I had some catching up to do.\n\n------\n\nHey all! Basically what I'm looking for is someone to play a line of football players railing their favorite team-cock sleeves, and celebrating in their win with a good orgy.\n\nMy biggest kinks are cheating, public, cock-worship, group sex and using gifs/pics in the RP. If you have an alternate look for the characters, or any tweaks you want to make, that will probably pique my interest too!\n",

            "selftext": "I walked casually down the hall, my refilled water bottle in hand. It was third period, I didn't have a class to teach during third period but not that it meant I had no work to do. I headed back to my classroom, the task I need to complete in my mind. Grading papers was the pits but it had to be done. I freeze a few steps inside my room, awkwardly stopped to greet my unexpected guest.\n\n\"Principal Knox... uh, hi. Is everything alright? I didn't miss a staff meeting I don't think...\"\n\nI rack my brain which is slightly buzzed with panic. Why was he here? What if there had been complaints about my teaching? I was really enjoying it here, I didn't want to.... My train of thought is cut off by his light chuckle and response.\n\n\"No, you're always punctual to meetings Ms. Colby.\" He smiles. I smile. It's still awkward.\n\n\"I don't know if you were aware, Alison.\" He emphasizes my first name and it sounds... odd. He continues.\n\n\"Yesterday, I was observing your class during last period.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" I swallow hard. What did that mean?\n\n\"I'm concerned that you're not being... assertive enough with your students. Their behavior and what you allow to go unpunished in here was a bit alarming.\"\n\nI blush and look down. It was true, I was a push-over. When they talked I just talked over them rather than chastise their talking out of turn. I turned a blind eye to things like using their cell phone in class and never corrected the noise level.\n\n\"Alison, when I hired you, I was eager to get some fresh blood in this school and you came highly recommended by West Falls. I understand the type of environment you're used to teaching in but I need you to understand things are different here. You're no longer working in private school but the public school system. Many of these kids come from broken homes, absentee to downright neglectful parents. If you allow them, they will take advantage of your good nature. They know no better, it is why I expect my teachers to have a good head on their shoulders.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling deflated. I could only nod in shame. I was a disappointment. I was the only new hire over the summer and only one of three teachers under the age of 40. I thought my gentle and progressive approach to teaching would benefit the students here but I was failing them.\n\n\"Alison, please shut door behind you and come here.\"\n\nI follow his instructions. As I shut the door, I hear an added command. \"Lock it.\" I pause for only a moment before following through on that as well. When I reach my desk, he's still sitting in the chair. Unsure of what to do, I only stand, fidgeting nervously. He pushes the rolling chair back but remains planted.\n\n\"Have a seat, Alison. We have more to talk about.\"\n\nI look in his eyes, my confusion must be apparent but he makes no effort to explain more. I follow my gaze down to his lap. Was he really suggesting...\n\n\"Sit!\" It's more of a bark than shout.\n\nI almost jump from the sudden change in tone. Hesitantly I walk forward, turn around and ease myself into his lap. My back to his chest, I can feel his warm body heat. I adjust slightly, pushing my bottom back against his crotch. He has no reaction other than to push the chair forward again, back to the desk.\n\n\"Now. Would you please read the last two lines of this report for me?\"\n\nHis voice is barely above a whisper and his breath lingers on the back of my neck. I can feel goosebumps rise all over my body. I struggle to find my voice, looking at the paper that lay flat in front of me. It was a student's work turned in two days ago.\n\n\"Um... It says 'In conclusion, Hitler was a bad guy. World War II was sad and that sucks.'\"\n\n\"Mmhmm... And what grade did you give this student for such work?\" I can feel his hand  push under my skirt, landing on my knee after he says it. I wait for more movement but he stays still, awaiting my answer.\n\n\"C-\" I reply meekly.\n\n\"C-? That's funny because this read like a solid F to me... Alison.\" His hand trails up, reaching my inner thigh, stopping and gripping lightly. I suck in a breath.\n\n\"You- You're right...\"\n\nI lean my head back, I can feel his fingers brush against the outside of my panties. Without thinking I part my legs more, pressing more of myself against him.\n\n\"I'm right what?\"\n\nI have to get ahold of myself to think. Guessing what he wanted to hear.\n\n\"You're right... Sir?\"\n\n\"Mm, good girl.\" He whispers low and directly in my ear. I let out a small whimper at feeling his finger slip past the thin fabric but before I can even relish in the sensation, it's quickly gone. He's gently pushed me off him and is standing. I can barely register what's happening before he reaches the door.\n\n\"I'm glad we got to have this talk Ms. Colby. I'll be keeping my eye on you very closely. Please remember, my office is always open if you need more.... guidance.\" His body is turned away from me, a hand already on the door knob but I can hear the smirk in his words. Then he's gone.\n\nI fall back into the now empty chair. *What the hell just happened?*\n\n*-End Prompt-*\n\nKinks- Gentle dominance, spankings, light restraints, dub-con, slut shaming, outer-course, breeding, romance, good writing",

You have to tilt your head up to look at my eyes, and if I got any closer, my huge breasts would smoosh your face! Like, just look at them! (I don't mind!) They're amazing! Soft mammaries almost as big as watermelons, practically **bursting** out of anything I slide over them.\n\nI'm *stronger* than you, with muscles that bulge when I flex, displaying my regime and work-ethic. I bet I could lift you with one arm, while the other hand covers my mouth mid-yawn. I eat protein for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Only the biggest appetite keeps this body in perfect shape.\n\nSo when I look down at you, there's a smile on *my* face because I know I can get any man I want now, and you really missed the boat back in high school. It's a good thing I'm nice, and giving you another chance.\n\n(DPP! I want a highschool reunion rp where I've changed since the last time you saw me. The link up top has more dialogue than this one, to give you a feel of the meeting. \n\nGet creative! Single sentence replies will be **ignored**! \n\nHope to hear from you!)",

But I beg to disagree. I intend on showing everyone that I'm still perfectly capable of being the neighbourhood slut, and fulfilling the fantasies of young men. \n\nI'm 42 now, and have evolved into sort of a perfect bimbo. My tits are huge and real, always shown off in the tight tops I wear. My ass is the best part of me, thick and matched with my wide hips, ready to provide a meal to anyone who wants to put their face between my cheeks and lick it, or ready to be pounded to my heart's content. I have long silvery blonde hair, blue eyes, and pale white skin. \n\nMothers tell their sons (18+ please!) to stay away from me because of the reputation I've developed. But why would you follow your mother's advice and turn down such a nice big booty just for you?\n\nWhen it comes to my kinks, I really love cock. Slobbering all over it, licking it, kissing it, worshipping it.... Especially a big cock. I love to be called dirty and passionate names by a younger man. I love to seduce them into fucking me and taking control. I love men who make use of my ass - pounding me from behind like the buttslut I am, or just licking my asshole. I like to be humiliated a bit, telling me what a naughty whore I am as you rub your cock in my face and make me lick your nuts or ass. I like my makeup to be smeared, and to leave lipstick marks all over your cock and chest. \n\nYou can be whoever you want, as long as you provide me with some thick young dick... just a neighbourhood kid trying me out for the first time, or maybe you're one of my favourites who visits me every day. \n\n\n",

I want to feel like it is really happening and I want to feel affection for you and the characters you play. I prefer real-life slice-of-life situations and characters over cliche or unrealistic portrayals. I have a ladyboner for authenticity and detailed and realistic buildups.\n\nI would love it for example if you could describe the characters, their everyday life, use some local colour etc. It just makes me feel like I am actually experiencing it. Of course I'm not, but I want you to make me feel like I do!\n\nSexually speaking, I am into double and triple penetration, muscles, squirting, falling in love and romance.

            "selftext": "I threw the two shopping bags toward's the corner of Cassie's bed before plopping down and leaning back on my elbows.\n\n\"But he *was* cute right?\" I wiggle my eyebrows in mocking, we both start laughing.\n\n\"Okay... yeah, he was kind of cute, you know, for an old guy.\" Cassie blushes at her confession.\n\nI scoff and resist the urge to role my eyes.  The \"old guy\" in question couldn't have been older than 27 at most, still a considerable age difference for our youthful 18 years but hardly scandalous.  Cassie was like that though, she always chose guys about as standard and interesting as a piece of dry toast.  Naturally she wouldn't give much thought to the attractive older guy that had been flirting with us at the mall.\n\n\"Cute older guy.... hm... you mean like... your Dad?\" \n\nI couldn't help myself and wasn't the least bit surprised when the pillow came down over my head.\n\n\"Don't even start, Tabitha!\" \n\nShe hates when I tease her about her dad, it had been a long running joke to my amusement basically since we had met.  I had seen some hot dads before but Cassie's dad took the cake by far.  He had been relatively young when she was born, so at not even 40 he was reaching his peak for sure.  A well toned body, not too muscular but certainly took care of himself, a dash of pepper in his hair and the type of professor beard that would make a young girl with daddy issues go wild.  I played it off as humorous of course but there was no doubt about it, Mr. Carver was my ultimate fantasy.\n\n\"Aww... don't worry Cass, when I seduce your dad away and we marry, I won't make you call me 'mom'.\"\n\nI wait, expecting another pillow hit or groan of disgust but Cassie gets oddly quiet.\n\n\"You okay...?  You know I'm just joking, I mean it's not like your dad would ever-\" But she cuts me off.\n\n\"My mom moved out last week.\" She responds quietly.  The sadness apparent in her eyes.\n\n\"What?! For real?\" I was completely shocked.  \n\n\"Yeah.  She left last Tuesday.  She told my dad she had been seeing someone else-\"  I'm quick to interrupt.\n\n\"Who?!\"\n\n\"Some guy from her work.  Dad barely even put up a fight about it!  Can you believe that?  When I asked him why, he told me that things had been bad for a while and even without this, they probably would have separated this summer now that I'm grown and leaving for college!\"\n\nCassie was visibly upset now.  I put an arm around her, offering support.  I could understand her feelings yet... still... my mind went off to the land of new possibilities.  Married men had never been an avenue I wanted to pursue.  I wasn't going to become a homewrecker which made Mr. Carver nothing more than a dream... But now, if he was free, the temptation was too great.  Maybe it was still a longshot but at least it was a shot now.\n\n\"Sorry.  Anyway I don't want to think about it anymore.  That's why I'm going to party my ass off at Chaotic tonight.  Amy said she wants to get in line by 9.  Are you okay with that?\"\n\nThe question interrupts my thoughts.  I try to recover nicely, hoping I don't look like I was just imagining fucking her father.\n\n\"Uh, yeah.  That works.  Hey, I gotta go.  I have to stop by work and approve my shift for next week.  See you tonight, k?\"\n\nAt home I went over every piece of clothing in my closet, trying to pin the right look.  In the end I settle for a light blue, eyelet sundress.  A once over in the mirror seals my approval.  I looked innocent yet womanly.  I think.  I had been 18 for many months now but being the same age as his daughter, I knew he would have trouble seeing me for the woman I was, or well, the woman I was ready for him to make me.\n\nI grab my phone, clicking out a quick text to Cassie.  *Sorry, not feeling well tonight, I'm going to have to pass. You guys have fun without me!*.  I look at the clock, 8:50.  She should be out of the house by now.  Grabbing my purse and a light sweater I head out.\n\nIt's completely dark by the time I arrive at the broken Carver home.  If there was any doubt that he wasn't hurting at least a little, the whiskey in his hand when he answers the door tells me otherwise.  He's genuinely surprised to see me.\n\n\"Tabitha.  Hi... you just missed Cassie about a half hour ago.  She was going to a club tonight, I believe.\" He gives an earnest smile.\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm actually here to see you, Mr. Carver.\"\n\n*end*\n\nKinks: Romance, D/s, dub con, age gaps, impregnation, slut shaming, outercourse, DD/lg\n\nLimits: Toilet, violence, bestiality",

Rub your hard cock up against me while I'm cleaning the counter, convince me that I want it (even though we both already know I do). Flash me your cock while I'm swimming in your pool and jack off in front of me before you tell me to come take care of you.\n\nI guess I'm *that* kind of girl, huh?\n\nThe roles I like usually involve older men, but I'm up for discussion. I like:\nBest friends/boyfriends dad,\nnext door neighbor (married or not),\ndad's friend/coworker,\ndad's boss,\nteacher,\nhandsy customer.\n\nI'm sure there are some I've missed, so I'm open to discussion.\n\nMy kinks include:\nInitial DubCon that progresses into consensual, rough sex, riding, public anything (groping, fucking, whatever. I love to be watched most of the time), oral of course, bit of name calling. That's all I can think of right now. My mind seems to be drifting elsewhere.\n\nIf anything I've said has interested you, I should probably introduce myself! I'm Emily. I'm 5'6 with brown hair and blue eyes. I play soccer whenever I can (I'm a striker) so I would describe my body type as athletic. Well, as athletic as I can be with size 36 DD's. I'm a waitress (hence the handsy customer role) and a college student. I'm on the fairer side skin wise, but I do get pretty tan along with everyone else in the summer.\n\nI think I've said it all! Come message me. I'm sure I'd love to play with you.",

In that moment Alison became the embodiment of love and justice, able to transform into the hero Libra. But it had been years since she stopped the demon Lilith. Her powers faded away, as did the purple fox cosmo. It was as if it never happened. \n\n\nAlison grew up. She got married to a man she thought she loved. She had two gorgeous children. She worked a job she hated that made just enough money. Alison grew jaded. No longer did she belief in concepts of live and justice. No, when your an adult all that was left was lust and revenge. \n\n\nAt least that's what she thought until Cosmo came back. The world was in danger once again. A Demon like nothing Libra had faced. His plans were to turn all of Humanity into his slaves. \n\n\nWhy? Alison wanted so desperately to ask why she should be the one to save the world. This stupid world that had done nothing to repay her. She had gotten hurt so many times trying to save them and they didn\u2019t even know. So when Cosmo bestowed his powers onto Alison, it wasnt Libra who emerged.\n\n\nInstead Alison became Temptress. The embodiment of Lust and Revenge. Angry at the world and with no believe in a happy ending. Before Alison could save humanity, she would have to restore her faith in it. She would have to find how to become Libra again. \n\n\n(Honestly this could go many different ways. It could be a bad ending. Alison is not able to become Libra again and gets turned into her new enemies slave. Or maybe she ends up restoring her relationship with her husband. Or she could find love elsewhere. There are honestly so many ways this can go so I am open to input!)\n\n",

She's said it and proved it a number of times, among her many other talents, she can make you cum with just her thumb. You knew better than to doubt her, she's proved it many different times.\n\nLike now, both of you inside a nightclub, sitting close to one another in a comfortable booth. It was dark, awfully so save for the flashing lights that pulsed to the rhythm of the heavy EDM playing. You could only catch glimpses of her, which was a shame be a useful she was so beautiful. You were biased of course since she was your 'Mommy', the woman you worshipped, the woman you accepted being a house-husband too, the woman that wore the 'pants' in your relationship.\n\nShe says pants, but really, it's pencil skirts and stockings. She was some sort of executive for a very successful company, which explained why she wore those pencil skirts that stopped just above her knees, stockings, and blouses. Like right now. Her lightly tanned skin was regretfully covered up by a beige pencil skirt, jiggly, malleable ass cushioning her as she sat. Big F-Cups slumped on her chest, making her blouse almost tight enough to blow off the buttons in a heartbeat...\n\nYou looked up as she looked down at you, the height difference enough to make a difference, with that devilish smirk; naturally thick cherry red lips forming into a kiss that impacted your forehead. She loved doing that, kissing your cheeks, forehead, head, whatever wasn't your lips because she liked the Mommy role she forced upon you. You weren't complaining though, you loved her to death.\n\nHer arm was wrapped around you, keeping you close, down into your shorts, where she was slowly, ever so softly stroking you with that soft hand of yours, pushing her thumb against your spongy cock head and cooing.\n\n\"Remember the rules of the game~,\" she warned as you moaned for the seventh time. You gulped loudly, you remembered exactly what would happen. The game was simple, every time you moaned, she would spank you when they got home. If you came...well, you'll fi-\n\nBoom, you came. So suddenly that she couldn't even predict it, your veins didn't pop up, your moans weren't different than your seven others, you don't even warm her. In fact, you didn't even get permission. Her hand froze around you, as you spider your shorts, her skirt, and a bit of her blouse as you came. You two stayed like that for God knows how long, before she gripped your hair and leaned down to your ear, \"Bad, bad boy...\"\n\nShe was up in a flash, gripping you by your arm and put g you roughly through the crowd, ignoring the looks and stares as she dragged you into the Woman's bathroom, letting the door slam shut, masking your incessant pleas and sorry's as she opened up a stall, sat down, and forced you to her knee.\n\nThat night, you learned that you really like not being able to sit properly for a few days.\n\n(Can't take everyone, sorry. I'm still looking as of right now, so please go ahead and message.)\n\n(When you message me please begin with roleplay. I've given you a lot of opportunities and hints as to how you can start out. Don't continue off this post though, think of something new! After the roleplay itself, just add onto it in all of your kinks, limits, and other useful information you think I should know. Useful information does not include a description of yourself or a picture. Since I play a character I ask that you play a character. I roleplay so I can escape reality. With that out of the way, I thank you for reading this far! )\n\n(To prove that you have, there are a few things you can do. If you know what the SCP Foundation send me your favorite SCP in the title. If you don't know go ahead and put 'Kitten' instead. Talk to you soon~)",

Needless to say, my mind started wandering :P\n\nAnyway, I got the idea for a new scenario, where I play some kind of young naturalist, or maybe just a naive apprentice to one, who's involved in studies of the comparative reproductive biology of all kinds of different humanoids and monsters (focusing on the male side of things in particular &lt;3 ). Monsters of all kinds would respond to notices requesting male volunteers, and her job would be to do things like measure their penises in several different ways, or have them lie down and splay their legs so that she can weigh their testes on a scale. Maybe she'd have them pose while she makes detailed drawings of their genitals, and ask them questions about their sex lives... \n\nI'm sure you can come up with other ideas to make it sexier too :3",

            "selftext": "Your boss is a bitch. A real cunt. A sadistic whore high on her own power. You never liked her, few do honestly, but now she's gone and changed your life... forever. See, you made the royal mistake of walking into her office one afternoon without knocking. What you saw was her and the CEO of a rival company, fucking each other's brains out atop her desk. You gasped and shut the door, but it was too late. She *knows* you know. And she absolutely cannot have you blabbing about this. It would cost her everything. A woman like her will go to extreme lengths to protect her selfish life. And so she has.\n\nThey nab you that very same evening as you're heading out to your car. The bitch works fast. You're grabbed, gagged, and forced into the tight grip of a straitjacket. They buckle you up till you can't fidget, then, oddly, they put a device on your cock. A chastity belt, that locks your penis up in a little cage. ...but, why?\n\nThe reason is because you're being committed to a new and experimental mental institution. Shocking, I know, but it's too late to fight now. See, your boss got together with some powerful people over the last few hours and set up a whole fake 'incident' where you violently assaulted and attempted to rape her. They even doctored up a fake video of the incident's beginning. As such, the company's mental health evaluator saw no choice but to commit you for immediate safety of the public good. And since the institute's warden is old chums with your boss... you're not going anywhere for a long, *long*, time.\n\nBut, wait. There's hope yet! Hi. That would be me. Were you expecting I was the evil warden, or a sadistic worker or something? Nope. I'm actually kind of a sweetheart. I got into this line of work because I genuinely want to help people with mental illness. I've even got wholesome looks, akin to actress [Emmy Rossum](https://i.redd.it/wv93ct1qvzrz.jpg). In summary, I don't *want* to do anything mean or harsh to anyone. I'm just here to help.\n\nOf course, I don't know your situation. My papers say you're a schizo with paranoid delusions, and keeping you gagged is for your own good so you can't talk about them and convince yourself of these 'lies' any further. Poor baby. :( I'm going to fix you, I promise. But this *is* an 'experimental facility', like I stated. We use some unconventional means here, like that little cage on your penis. Getting a man under control is top priority... by any means necessary. \n\n***\n\n**Who this prompt is for**: Guys who are turned on by the idea of being restrained and controlled. Guys who don't mind their cocks locked away in chastity. Guys who aren't looking for a 'professional' grade Dominatrix with cruelty in her heart, but a more sweet and 'girl next door' type that is just doing her job. Also, writers who can write, and have some vested interest in developing character, plot, and maybe even, *gasp*!, escaping this facility with my help! \n\n**Who this prompt isn't for**: Bad writers, guys looking for a quick and dirty porno fix, fans of scat, pain, and excess cruelty. Uncreative people. My ex, Brandon, who I'm pretty sure keeps creating alternate accounts to stalk my posts on here and needs to GET OVER it already because it's not happening Brandon and you're honestly just being creepy at this point. Um, er... okay. Yeah.\n\nNow... who has the courage to get committed? Click here, and let me take care of you: /u/submissive_samantha\n\n",

I\u2019m pretty open kink wise, no toilet or gore, feel free to come adventure and see what you find! \n",

            "selftext": "\nWriting the email had been a blow to my pride, a humbling and worrying experience. We had just moved in, me and my Girlfriend. New to the city, and amazed at our good fortune - a decent sized one bedroom apartment, close to work, bars, and restaurants, and we could actually afford it? It seemed too good to be true... \n\nThe neighbors had warned us. The landlord was a serious man. He didn\u2019t like be inconvenienced, and he did NOT suffer late payments or bad tenants - why should he? He had applicants lined up to get into the building. \n\nBut I was sure he would understand. My email explained the mixup with payroll at work, and I gave a solemn promise to pay the rent in full, plus any applicable late fees, as soon as I was paid on Friday. Surely he would understand. Surely he would work with us, given our difficult situation... Right? \n\nIt had been over an hour since I\u2019d sent the message, and I\u2019d spent that time checking my inbox every few minutes for a response. Finally I\u2019d given up - maybe he was out of the office, or on vacation, or maybe he was fine with the arrangement. I couldn\u2019t spend all night worrying, cou-\n\n**KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK**\n\nThe door sounded like it was ready to come off its hinges. Like the knock was not just the Police, but the goddamn swat team. I was just getting up from the couch - a second-hand IKEA, just the kind of thing you\u2019d get from parents or an older sibling, or buy from Craigslist - when I heard.. keys in the door. \n\nThe man that stepped through the doorway was... big. Very big. Handsome, or perhaps not, and dressed in an obviously expensive suit. He adjusted his cuffs a bit as an Italian leather loafer pushed the door closed behind him, and he offered a frankly chilling smile. \n\n\u201c407C.... Christ, are you squatting in here?\u201d He commented, throwing a disdainful look over the apartment. We hadn\u2019t had time or income to go shopping for much... just a couch, a tv, and a mattress on the floor. \n\n\u201cI got your email. You must be Lee, right? Sit down, please...\u201d The man motioned, and I slowly shrank back down onto the couch. \n\nSeeing a man wrapped in such expensive clothes, I suddenly felt severely underdressed in my comfortable t-shirt and basketball shorts. \n\nHe would do the same with my girlfriend, if she was home, making sure he had a captive audience. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear. This is a discussion for your Man over there. And I do use that term loosely.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Lee, Work screwed you over and now you\u2019re trying to screw *me* over. Right?\u201d The look he threw me told me to keep silent. \u201cYou\u2019re already late. But I\u2019m a generous man. I\u2019m not inflexible.\u201d As he spoke, he made himself at home. \n\n\u201cYou can pay me right here, right now, plus late fees. Do that, and we will forget this whole thing ever happened.\u201d \n\nA tense silence stretched between us. \n\n\u201cNo? Tsk. Then we go plan B. On your feet, Lee. Hands against the wall.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?! You\u2019re going to mug me cause I didn\u2019t pay on time?\u201d I blurted in shock, already pushing to my feet. \n\nA hard, head-ringing slap was delivered to my cheek. I was twisted and SHOVED facefirst into the wall, arm twisted up behind my back to keep leverage. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how things work in Wherever-The-Fuck, USA, but here you pay your rent on time and in full. Otherwise I look weak, and the order I worked so hard to establish gets lost. So...\u201d A hand tugged my shorts down around my knees. Breath, hot and close, was felt on my ear. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you the chance to own your mistake and be a man, Lee. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll use your girl instead, and the neighbors can hear *her* squeal and moan. Your call...\u201d\n\nCome to think of it... we DID hear some rather odd sounds when we first moved in. Like.. grunts or groans... then moans... then a shrinking, crying sort of sound... \n\nWhat had I gotten us into? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlternate idea: Roommate Rape. Whether I was late on rent, we were drunk, or I just happened to pass out in a compromising position... \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOpen to tons of kinks and different options. I want to be taken viciously, ideally with my girlfriend watching. Whether my character loves or hates it, we can decide that together...\n\n",

            "selftext": "I knew the party was a bad idea. I'm not stupid, generally speaking. And when Darla stepped into the guest bedroom where I'd spent the last forty-five minutes struggling to squeeze into the costume she'd picked out for me, clucked her tongue, and said, \"Oh, honey, you can't have visible panty line with that thing. Take 'em off,\" I *knew* this whole thing was a dreadful, dreadful idea. \n\nDarla is a friend from the college where I teach a handful of Literature courses. Along with being generally boozier than I am, she's also *way* more extroverted -- I guess working in the Theatre Department does that. Extroverted enough that, totally unbeknownst to her students, she's a fairly popular semi-professional cosplayer, with a marked taste for comic book characters. Any undergrad who'd drifted through Darla's introductory acting courses while admiring her face and figure probably would have had his eyes fall out of his head if he'd seen her in that Poison Ivy outfit or dressed as Zatanna. \n\nOr in the outfit she was gleefully stuffing me into right now. \n\nIt took a few minutes of wrestling -- during which I am thoroughly convinced Darla snuck an intentional grope here and there; she started drinking way too early today -- but soon I found myself looking in the mirror again, dressed in shining black Lycra from shoulders to ankles, white gloves and matching high heeled boots fringed with tufts of black fur, a studded collar around my throat. The outfit was so tight that if the light hit me the right way -- without the benefit of my panties, unceremoniously tossed into a wastebasket -- I was sporting a severe cameltoe. Not that anyone would notice, what with the zipper drawn down nearly to my navel, my breasts threatening to go from 3/4ths on display to totally exposed with every step I took. Darla assured me that wouldn't happen, not with the precautions she'd taken. But I'm still grateful for the white fringe of fur that gives me a scrap of modesty between my throat and my waist. I'm grateful for the oversized domino mask and heavy makeup under it. It's just enough to disguise me ... assuming anyone will be looking at my face.\n\n\"Just one more thing,\" Darla murmurs, stretching her fingers through my pinned-up hair before carefully arranging the lustrous white wig over my scalp. She grins at my reflection, wrapping an arm around my waist. \"That's it! You're the Black Cat to a T.\" \n\n\"And I'm supposed to chaperone *you* in this outfit?\" I cross my arms over my chest, frowning at her. But she's barely paying attention to me, putting the final touches on the Batgirl outfit she's spent considerably more on than the hand-me-down I'm wearing. Classic 1960s version, the purple skintight material glittering faintly under the yellow cape. \n\n\"Honestly? I'd prefer you didn't.\" \n\nI have plenty of occasion during the taxi ride to the Halloween party Darla's picked out for us to crash to wonder just what her motive was ... but all that comes to a screeching halt as we pull up to a rambling Victorian style mansion, light and music streaming from every window, Halloween decorations adorning the porch, costumed people milling about in the yard ... and Greek letters hanging over the entrance.\n\n\"Jesus, Darla, this is a frat house!\"\n\n\"Mmhmm. I know that. Don't worry, *Felicia* ... you're in costume. No one here is going to recognize you.\"\n\nI look up at the frat house, almost vibrating with the pulsing music, my teeth sinking into my black-painted lower lip ...\n\n***\n\nHere's where you come in! It can be anyone at all you like, but two important things: 1) You don't recognize me as a professor right away. 2) You're someone I really, *really* shouldn't fool around with. Perhaps I have a son who goes to the school and you've been picking on him? That's just a suggestion, of course -- feel free to stretch your creative muscles. Ta!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Tonight I want to try something a little different, and I hope some guys are willing to help me!\n\nSo I've been thinking about free use a lot lately, and what that might mean for me. And in my mind it seems like one of the ultimate ways to submit to someone. Taking consent out of the relationship. It is simply, he is horny, and then he uses me. USES me. Like a tool to masturbate with. It can happen anywhere, at any time, and he will get off, and then I'm put aside until he uses me again. And the whole time, I never finish myself, because I was used, and slaves and cum dumpsters don't deserve orgasms. So then thinking about it obviously turns me on. Getting used like that is just so appealing, and I'd like to experience it somehow. I have my cumming dildo toy, and I think maybe I can make it work.\n\nI'm thinking our penpal relationship would really revolve around the free use kink. Any time you are horny, you'd contact me, and I'd have to use the toy on myself like you would be using me. So I'll keep the toy with me in my bag whenever I go out, and try to stay aroused just in case I'm used. But of course, I'm willing to give up orgasms as well as long as needed to please the men who use me. It's already almost been a week since my last orgasm, and my thoughts seem to be on cum a lot now, I wonder what might happen if I went longer.\n\nSome guys have asked about Kik before, which I'm willing to do with a limit. I don't do pictures.\n\nSo what I'm looking for in a man is someone who will be mean, maybe even abusive to me. Call me names, make me degrade myself, and see me as just a cum dumpster. And I want to point out, calling me terrible names is another big turn on of mine, along with the free use, and plenty of cum.\n\nIf any of this sounds nice, I'd love to hear from you! Please feel free to message me late as well, I'll try and get to everyone. The only thing I ask is don't do anything with blood or poop. Hope to hear from you guys soon! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I know this is a wall of text... and I'm sorry about that, but here we go!\n\nI'm looking to RP with someone where I'm 'forced' to submit to his orders and obey his commands. I use the quotes around forced because I don't want it to be a physical force like rape, but more so a mental manipulation into convincing me that submitting to you as your personal sex slave is the right thing to do...\n\nI usually prefer long term realistic roleplaying that involve a good amount of detail, character development, and build up. I don't want to go straight into the sex part, it gets old I think. \n\nSo, how we know each other can vary.  We could be neighbors, sibling's friend/bully, best friend's sibling, father's buddy... and the list goes on. One thing I do ask is for an age gap between us.\n\nNow onto the interesting part... How you make me yours. Overall, I'm looking for a setup that will awaken the deep desire inside me to submit to a man as he shows me he is the most important person in the world and needs to be obeyed (think Alpha male mentality) Here are some of my favorites, but if you have another idea, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n* My favorite idea is that the guy would be so cocky, controlling, and manipulative that it would slowly awaken a deep desire inside me to obey and he plays off that new found feeling. I'd like this to be a theme in any situation we play out, but it can also stand by itself.\n\n* Another option is we make some sort of bet that I end up losing. This starts the ball rolling towards my ultimate submission. But just because I lost a bet of some sorts doesn't mean I'll immediately drop to my knees and start blowing you... But it'll start pushing me in that direction. Maybe the loser has to be a servant for the winner; It starts with fetching drinks/food, then moves to massages, then more.\n\n* A third idea, and this is as \"unrealistic\" as I like to go, is that you somehow brainwash me to make me more receptive to your advances and to accept your superiority. Maybe by drugs, hypnosis, or subliminal messages in music you're playing... It wouldn't instantly make me a mindless slave, but slowly make me feel more submissive and obedient.\n\nOne setup I /usually/ hate is blackmail... Yes, it is very realistic, but it leads to very little build up... Usually once the blackmail material is revealed it goes directly into \"ok, you're my sex slave, let's do it.\" I'm not saying it couldn't be done right under the correct circumstances (or added onto some other idea) but an exclusive blackmail setup doesn't peak my interests.\n\nA little about me, I'm 25, 5'4\", slightly wavy dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, 34D, girl next door/sporty girl mix. I usually prefer playing around my age or younger (maybe late 20s at the oldest for me). Big kinks I have are ageplay (either I could be younger or you could be younger), impregnation, name calling, humiliation... Others include public play, mild bondage, &amp; bimbofication... My only real limits are blood and scat.  [Here's a kink table I made](http://i.imgur.com/yxoqaKn.jpg?1)\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading. Shoot me a message with your ideas &amp; thoughts about what setup you'd like to do... Please send me more than 1 sentence.",

I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people who clicked on this because of the word Fallout in the title have seen Shadman's delightfully depraved digital dame Vault Meat and wonderful adventures through the Wastelands of post-war America. But I'm here to propose something similar, yet different.\n\nVault 248; not a special vault on the outside, but on the inside of the mysterious steel safehouse; every occupant is a beautiful Asian-American woman carefully selected for their looks and builds, for the rather grim purpose of serving as perfect sex toys and fuck-slaves for post-war America. Subjected to cryogenic stasis and over two centuries of subconscious brainwashing, they are now released one by one by a computer glitch into the wider wasteland to be used by any and all who can find them.\n\nMy name is Ari, a Japanese-American of particularly slight and compact build, a mere five-foot-one and ninety two pounds, perfect for being carried along by whomever takes me. Easy and portable; and mentally shaped as a perfect slave. I can be beaten and raped and I will beg for more with every kick to the ribs and shot of cum up my bruised asshole. \n\nWhite men and women of a cruel and abusive nature are most appreciated, though others may join in if desired. I particularly enjoy unique and interesting scenarios using the setting and interesting tech and creatures of Fallout beyond the usual 'raped by a gang of Super Mutants/raiders' thing everybody seems so obsessed with. What's wrong with being the fucktoy of a group of Brotherhood of Steel soldier, strapped to a suit of power armour like a hunk of meat? Maybe I'm recruited by the Followers of the Apocalypse as a 'stress relief aide'? I'm sure there's an NCR platoon in need of a unit cumdump.\n\nGo wild, folks, my only limits are blood and death. Besides that, go absolutely nuts and bring on the pain and misery; I promise I'll enjoy it.",

            "selftext": "Hay guys!\n\nI am looking for a long term roleplay partner who is open to some pretty weird prompts today! I have actually included my kinklist, seeing how I have finally made one. \n\nPrompts galore!\n\nDaddy's little princess: This one is incest revolving around a girl who has been her Daddy's favorite girl for a long time but when he finally starts to date again she throws a huge fit. I would love for this revolve around a lot of training, punishments and rewards, praising, and DD/lg. OOOH and ageplay\n\nThe orcs bride: This one is my favorite! So bassically I would play an 18 year old Elven girl who is about to be married. As per tradition, she is taken to the river bath alone and is taken by a group of Orcs who have been going far and wide to find the most beautiful woman as their Chieftains bride. \n\nLockdown: You have lived alone since the world ended, pretty sure you were the last surviving person in the world. Until I break into your hiding spot. Basically this is creepy touch starved man and younger touch starved girl in post apocalypse world. \n\nthe winter soldier: This would take place after Captain America Winter Soldier. Bucky is on the run with really no memory of who he is, other than the memories of being an asset. And he ends up in a red light district of london, where women and men are paid to fuck and let people watch them. Basically live porn. I really want to play this out with Bucky. \n\nRed light: Basically the same prompt above except you are a man who owes someone a lot of money and is offered to work the debt off. And so you get paired with me. \n\nReylo: Hay! So I want to either play out the sooo inappropiate uses of the force (If youve seen the last jedi then we can do this one) or a different ending to the force awakens with Kylo instead fucking Rey and becoming her master (in more ways than just with the force)\n\nKinklist: https://i.imgur.com/cgieqzu.png",

            "selftext": "The House of Predicaments\n\n2009, October 27th\n\n\"The offer was simple. $1 Million dollars if we could survive the so called House of Predicaments for seven days. And that's not as a group, that's per person. The three of us, myself, Scarlett and Lillie, didn't consider the thing to be real once we heard it, rather, we just assumed it was a hoax of some kind. But then people started to enter the house, and leave. Safe, fine, or so they appeared to be on the surface anyway. So we thought we'd give it a chance, I mean, we didn't have anything better to do. Mawburgh wasn't too far from our college, anyway. At the end of college, our youth soon to fade out, we decided on one last adventure to cement our friendship, forever. What we found cemented our friendship in a way. And we were bounded together, forever, at each other's side... Only I would manage to escape. My mind was plagued with that I had seen, what I experienced, what I felt. I had become either broken or mad.\n\nWhen we reached the house, we brought everything we needed, food, drinks (especially booze), as the house looked fairly empty. It was a grand mansion, located in the literal middle of nowhere. The place was breaking down, and had an incredibly eerie atmosphere. We would joke that it was haunted, but it wasn't, at least, not by any ghosts or anything. We soon learned that as night came by. We already knew the doors would be locked, and the windows sealed, so escape was impossible. We knew that, but entered anyway.\n\nWe would sleep through the night, but soon find ourselves missing. The grand mansion began to feel even larger than before, and, armed with just a torchlight, I set off to find my friends. God, I am shaking just thinking of it now. Traps. Everywhere, in every room. Some would tie you down into a cage, rimmed with vibrators, others into automatic spanking machines, with whips to whip you until you'd go mad. When I encountered the first one of these, I realised this wasn't part of the agreement. Someone had got in.\n\n\"The Trapper\", he was known, an eccentric and cruel rapist known for trapping their victims in brutal and humiliating machines. Some would record the victims, letting their image go live if they failed to keep back the orgasms. Others would force the victims to degrade themselves and even hurt themselves to get out of the traps. The traps were designed in such a way that one could escape... but at great peril. Two girls tied to one post, forced to exchange semen from one tank to each other. Easy right? Except they could only use their mouths. Failure to do so would proceed in a forced and near permanent inflation of the stomach with lots and lots of semen. We were trapped there, forced to go through these traps daily, and soon realised that we weren't going to be there for seven days. No, the trapper had planned to keep us there our entire life. I managed to escape, but I live in constant fear. He's watching me, waiting for me, threatening me daily. It's only a matter of time until he takes me back.\"\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nlimits: scat, snuff",

            "selftext": "We've lost the war. It took three long, hard years, but the Three Kingdoms of the Elves are no more. Arcturil, Drakuril and Verduril have each fallen, and the High Elves and Drow and Sidhe have been brought to their collective knees by the might of humans and Dwarves and Minotaurs and every other species under the sun. Mostly humans, however; it was the Imperial Host that crushed Arcturil and Drakuril alike, and its soldiers swarmed the streets of Verduril and burned down its great trees.\n\nElves are now in a position of utter defeat; our women in chains, our men slain and our children captured. And all because of one thing, one crucial advantage we sorely lacked; human cock.\n\nHuman cock is a brutal, monstrous thing in this world. Elven penises are like us; small and slender. Most elven men are cursed with but a few petty inches. But human cock is powerful and destructive, human men often times holding upwards of a foot of womb-crushing, mind-shattering cock in their pants. \n\nTheir women too are better; elven women look to be carved from glass, spindly and fragile, often barely more than five feet in height with meagre endowments on our chests and small, toned asses. But human women are curvaceous and powerful, thick thighs and bubbly posteriors and incredible breasts the size of mens' heads. \n\nYes, Elves are inferior to our human overlords. Lesser beings worthy only of slavery and contempt beneath the heel of this mighty species. \n\nWill you prove that to me? \n\n**So, what's it gonna be? You will play human, that's really the only mandate, and men will be incredibly well endowed whilst women will be infinitely more curvaceous than myself. And who will I play? A lean and hungry Sidhe with light green skin and auburn hair? A dark and brooding Drow with pale grey skin and cold blue eyes? Or a haughty and arrogant high elf with porcelain skin and long blonde hair?**\n\n**Kinks are effectively endless and limits are almost nonexistent; no blood or death. That's it. For this RP I really want to build on the degradation and the fact that to the world; my character is less than human, an animal. Property. Some individual kinks depending on whichever race I am are nice as well.**\n\n**If I'm playing Sidhe, make me stay in the city and restrain and restrict me as much as you can. Make me wear ridiculously high heels, hobble me with chains, attach weights to me; Sidhe love freedom and you don't like me being happy. As a drow, keep me close to you and others. Gangbangs and being used publicly are great, as are displays of public humiliation and punishment. Drow are solitary creatures by nature; exploit that. Finally, high elves are proud. Make me not proud. Make me live in squalor, clothed in dirty rags and kept filthy. Use me as a toilet and make me soil my own living quarters or even myself. Being used as a cumrag is good too, or being cuckqueaned. Women, constantly compare my body to yours and make me feel inferior that way.**\n\n**So bring it on, humans of DPP. Show this elf cunt what a real man or woman looks like.**",

Occasionally their kin would raid the human and elf camps to steal food and women but they were otherwise a quiet and isolationist kind. Word came one day of a civil war amongst the clans and that a new Grand Warchief had been named, not long after trade began to flow out of the region, envoys were dispatched, it seems as if the bullish men of the north were ready to interact with the rest of the world.\n\nYou were a simple scholar from the city of Chrissydia, part of the students of the giant Library of Henley, a citadel for all sciences and alchemies. An expert of fauna and biology a scroll was delivered to you, a quest from the head master librarians themselves.\n\nTheir records of Minotaur's breeding and procreation were almost two hundred years out of date and were in desperate need of updating. You were being tasked with that job, to head north immediately to begin study.\n\nLittle did the college know just how accurate their updates would be, the lavish detail you would put into describing the exact shape and dimension of a minotaur cock, how it felt to have the collossal fuck meat slid inside an eager pussy. How eagerly you regaled how their infamous musk destroyed your brain and free will, how you screamed in ecstasy as your cunt was flooded with their virile seed which you meticulously tabled out the fertility and birth rates for.\n\nThough perhaps the most shocking but least surprising entry of all was a small foot note left on your thesis.\n\n\"I am not returning to the Library, I am their property now, I am not allowed to leave, I belong to them now, my body is their toy. And even if I was allowed to leave...I would never do it.\"\n\n---\n\nBack again with another minotaur prompt, what can I say, I love beastman cocks. \n\nI have basically every kink imaginable, bonus points to anybody not scared to get gross and hardcore with this, not required though.\n\nOnly limits are vore and feet, never did anything for me.\n\n",

It was probably unfair of me to expect her to go ahead and just ask a stranger on a date, but she needed it after her horrific breakup a week or so ago, and besides, let's not forget she asked me to help her out in the first place. After some consideration, I ran my fingers through my silky hair before saying \"you do realise men are terrified of you, don't you?\", and they were, she'd knock them out with a twirl, render them winded and withered with a 'thank you', have them weakened by a subliminal sultry smile; they'd stop dead in their tracks to latch onto the racy breath of perfume left in her wake, every time slack jawed and numb, raring to dream later that night. She let out a gentle sniff which at first gave me the impression she was seconds away from weeping, but soon appeared to be a result of the weather, as a fresh and icy wind swept between the buildings around us, smacking our rosy cheeks. She wasn't listening to me anyway, and had already began to press the exceedingly long set of numbers that made up her phone password, as she widened her eyes at the scent of that morning's freshly baked bread down the road. That kinda hurt a little.\n\nMotivated by my frustration, I got up silently, swayed on the spot for a moment, making sure to plant some eye contact with you before we crossed paths, stopped you dead in your tracks and said in my most innocent sounding voice \"hey! Look, you'd fuck me, right?\" Completely deadpan, a hint of a smile maybe, perhaps a few fluttered eyelashes, but ultimately without feeling, which in itself gave it an unspeakable intensity, and more passion than pitch ever could.\n\nBeckie's anxiety caused her to practically collapse into herself, but I continued \"And you'd fuck my friend too, wouldn't you?\" This time making a conscious effort to be as physically close to you as possible, touching everything with its counterpart, as I lower the volume of my voice to that of a breathy whisper, poised and purring like a cat going in for a kill. \n\n\"I can talk her into it\".\n____________\n\nbut what is \"it\"? Well, maybe a threesome, perhaps you're just interested in Beckie, perhaps just me. Whatever really, I have some time to kill ;)",

Oooo change my race back and forth over and over? \n\nOr maybe leave my body just like it is but make me do embarrassing things. Force my body to get wet at bad times. Or to flirt with people I don\u2019t want to. Make me give my name as dummy at starkbucks? Oooo or just make me talk like I\u2019m dumb or be dumb for real!\n\nSomehow I keep slipping and falling face first into your crotch? \n\nIf your a girl, use your powers for some amazing lezzie fun? \n\nYou get the idea :) Message me with some sexy ideas, the start of a scene, or just tell me what I\u2019m in for!

            "selftext": "**Edit: this blew up like crazy, way more than I had originally anticipated! And I'm glad for all the attention it got, and all the wonderful messages of people who are interested! However, I have to ask that if you are interested please hold your PM for a day or two. Otherwise I might not be able to play with you! Sorry in advance!**\n\n\n\n**Note: I'd prefer people who have a good or at least decent understanding of the general themes of Starcraft and the lore surrounding it. You don't have to be an expert, but knowing what the difference between a Zerg and a Terran, an overlord and a banshee is, would be great!**\n\n\n***\n\n\nHey there, reader! I'm a big fan of Blizzard's 'Starcraft' universe, and my favorite race of the three available is the Zerg. I find them extremely awesome in both personality and aesthetics. But what prompted this idea to play out a scenario revolving them and a Terran, were a couple of short comics and just some general smutty art that I found! \n\n\nI'd love to play a scene where a Terran is captured by a Zerg brood and turned into a breeding vessel as a sort of emergency measure by the Zerg who have yet to establish themselves on this new planet. It would be a civilian-primary planet, with little defenses and most of the focus being on producing general goods for the rest of the Terran race. The Zerg would spot this weakness and do as they do; exploit it to gather the resources for themselves.\n\n\nI'll probably be playing multiple different units throughout this roleplay, or just one or two, depending on how long the roleplay goes on for! I don't very much mind what your character is, if it's a regular civilian, a medic or a marine. Though, I will say I am very interested in a ghost operative https://i.imgur.com/nzdRjIm.jpg (pic for reference to a ghost operative, but you can definitely come up with your own looks! Encouraged, even!)\n\n\n\nThis could be a long-term roleplay, or a short-term roleplay. I'm open to both, so tell me which you'd be most interested in doing!\n\n***\n\n\nKinks that will definitely be part of this roleplay: oviposition, impreg, non-con(to consent?), body modifications/alterations, excessive cum (cum inflation?), and cervix penetration*, hyper/rapid pregnancy.\n\n\n\nMy own kinks include, but are not limited to: receiving end of worshipping, large cumloads, impreg, anal, (sloppy) deepthroat/blowjob, non-con/full-con, cumflation, cum-overflow, rough sex, **body modifications/alterations** (tattoos, piercings, enhancements... etc.) lipstick marks, **unrealism**, descriptive and literate partners... That should give a pretty good general idea of what I'm into.\n\n\n\nMy limits are scat and gore.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n*Cervix penetration. I know what you might be thinking, that shit hurts. But this is a fictional world, where realism doesn't have to apply, and shouldn't. If nothing else, Zerg are very ingenuitive which is where body modifications come in handy!\n\n\nTo the people who would still be interested in trying to play this out with me, but lack knowledge on the subject; don't be deterred! I'm a very patient person, and I don't mind answering questions if you are genuinely interested in learning, so don't hesitate!\n\n\n\nIf you do decide to message me, please include more than five words in your first PM. First impressions are important and may very well shape the rest of the roleplay. I can not stress this enough: include your kinks and your limits and let me know if there are any of mine that you *absolutely do not* want, likewise, if there are any you *definitely* want to be part of the play.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day!",

            "selftext": "Torin's head snapped up, his expression one of surprise that quickly turned to anger. With a loud thump, he closed the musty tome before him and turned around. Absentmindedly adjusting the thick cloak hanging from his tall frame as he walked over to a stone staircase, and began his long winding descent downward, seemingly lost in thought. *A girl approaching my tower at this hour\u2026.she must be mad, or lost, or not merely human\u2026.well she has to be some part human otherwise the wards would have kept her out. Still\u2026.why here and now\u2026.did one of the cities fall to a demon attack? If so she must\u2019ve been running since early morning\u2026.what a headache. I don't have time for this, I have tests to conduct\u2026.and it\u2019s nearly nightfall.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nReaching the first floor of his tower Torin made his way to the front door, his steps silent on the cold stone beneath his heavy boots as he traversed the dimly lit hallway, an odd sight for someone of such large stature. Finally, standing before a massive iron door, he waited for the girl to find her way, as he sensed her presence slowly trudging forward, no doubt lost in the overgrowth that was his front yard. While Torrin stood there there re-tracing the large wards he had placed upon the door many years earlier, it occurred to him that he never once had a visitor in all this time. He had stumbled upon this long forgotten dwelling some time ago, when he was still but a teenager, and as far as he knew he was the only one to ever lay eyes upon it since.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs a magical prodigy he grew up well liked in his home settlement, that was until the day he tried to place a ward on a small child. At the time it made perfect sense to him, how better to protect everyone from the demons that ruled their lives, than to place wards on themselves? Thus allowing his friends and family to survive the night outside of their cramped city walls with protection. Unfortunately, due to a lack of proper training, no one had explained to Torin the horrors that befell a human who had a ward wrote upon them. Thus Torin was cast outside of the settlement shortly after his deadly experiment and left to die. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhich normally would have been the case, but Tornin wasn't a normal boy, and he managed to survive night after night, while fleeing many miles away. Finally, one night discovering the abandoned tower that he now resided in. Just thinking about those long nights again, gave him chills. The demons that ruled the dark nights of their world, were by far the most vile things imaginable, with an insatiable hunger for human flesh and strength enough to easily kill any mortal man. If it wasnt for the city walls and the magicians that kept those walls warded, the human race would have been devoured by them long ago.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe upside to the horror filled nights that Torin scarcely survived as a teenager, was the freedoms he gained, to learn and experiment as he pleased. One would think that such a hollowing experience would convince him to never try magic like that again, but instead he devoted his life to it. Torin knew that eventually he would find a way to imbue humans with the necessary magic to repel the demons and take back the world from the evils that came forth every night. Nowadays Torin actually considered himself lucky for getting thrown out of his birth settlement, as his new home and the experience of surviving those nights gave him many advantages that he never would have had otherwise. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe tower he claimed as his own many years ago, was several stories tall, made entirely out of thick stone and wrought iron, standing on the edge of a sparsely populated forest. From the outside it appeared as though the the old stone building was about threes stories tall, when in reality the tower descended another two full storied underground. To the north of the tower was a small settlement, that Torin rarely ever visited as it took a several days to reach.  However, one of the largest settlements in the country lay to the east of him, and that one only took a full day\u2019s walk to reach, much to his delight.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause of this he had been able to acquire a lot of information and many books over the years, in addition to keeping his supplies easily stocked, thanks to the numerous traders that frequented the settlement. Even though his birth place was easily weeks away, he still made sure to disguise himself each time he entered the large settlement, so as avoid any unnecessary suspicion. During his many visits, he made sure to make friends with several of the more \u201cexperienced\u201d girls at the brothel there. While they were more than eager to befriend him for what lay beneath his clothes, what really interested Torin was their willingness to test out some of his more experimental devices.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTorin, being far more knowledgeable now then when he was a teen, knew that the key to creating a magically warded human being, started long before the child was conceived. He also knew that eventually he might have to ask one of those maidens from the settlement to come back with him, and for more than one reason. It was this thought that made Torin\u2019s anger subside as the girl finally reached the door to his tower. Within moments a loud rapping could be heard echoing throughout the long stone hallway where he stood. Straightening his back, he stood tall and rigid, his lean yet solid frame looking almost as if it were cut from the same stone as the tower. With dazzling green eyes that almost glowed in the dimly lit room, and a chiseled jaw, covered in stubble, he reached out and opened the massive iron door. Flinging it wide open as if it weighed nothing at all. A grin tugging at the corners of his mouth to greet this new girl.\n\n***\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, first off, I\u2019m looking for a longer roleplay, with bonus points for good grammar and juicy details. Secondly, don't feel like you have to write quite as much as I did right off the bat; I did it mainly for setup purposes and worldbuilding. \n\nAlso, as long as this post is up, I'm more than happy to see orange envelopes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat said, I left out some detail on purpose, especially when it came to the description of the girl, so please feel free to be creative and fill in her appearance as you see fit.  Also, I figure there\u2019s several different directions we can take this story in, and there's certainly plenty of fun and creative opportunities open to us, so don't hold back and we will see where things lead.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs for kinks and such, I\u2019m open to most things, but I\u2019m not a fan of vore, gore, and any toilet related activities. \nSeveral of my favorites are as follows: large insertions, size difference, anal, \u201crough sex,\u201d some bondage, collars, biting, chocking, ogasm control, sexual depravity, master/pet, the wetter the better, lots of cum, and cock worship.

Sometimes sex, albeit usually not the vanilla kind. \nAnd we've *long* ago given up trying to get anything serious out of each other. \n\nAnd tonight I find myself tied up, half naked, with no clue where I am or how I got here. Someone drugged me? Well in my business that happens. \n\nI have no clue yet that it's you--and you're enjoying that fact *way* too much. You don't really want to hurt me, you don't really want to get any information out of me.\n\nYou just want to toy with me and take my dignity again. Because it's hilarious and fun.\n\n----\n\nSo who are we? A pair of spies, for country or business, who originally were trying to get information out of each other but that fell by the wayside? A cop and a criminal, with our respective 'sides' hammering down on us to get information, while we have no intention of letting this dance end? Members of rival sports teams, or their fans? I'm curious to see what you come up with.\n\nI'm not looking for outright sex here. I am seriously fearplay curious, though for me the draw is the humiliation upon realizing that the fear was unwarranted rather than the fear itself. Being kidnapped without knowing what's happening when it's someone who has no intention of hurting me has always been a fantasy of mine.\n\nI'm looking for someone who is doing this for amusement and a dominance high. I don't like mean spiritedness. Cruel and hurtful people need not apply--this is supposed to be a frenemy thing. \n\nKinks as sub: Tickling is my biggie and virtually mandatory. Orgasm tease/denial/force, humiliation of the bratty variety (less degradation, more \"hah, look what I have over you\"). I'm fearplay curious like I said. Being stripped or anything else embarrassing sheerly for the sake of embarrassing me.\n\nDislikes: Pain. Cruelty. PIV sex. The usual, kids, body fluids, animals, illegal. \n\nPlease send me a message and let's see if we're compatible before we start.

            "selftext": "Credits for the title go to the user who messaged me with it previously. Sorry, I don't remember your username!\n\n**DISCLAIMER: Just to preface this post, it involves bestiality and cuckolding, two kinks that many people may not want in their roleplays. It will also involve you controlling yourself as well as a dog. If you aren't into any of this, you can stop here, but thanks for stopping by!**\n***\nThings were going well, right? You thought so. Happily married for over five years now, a recent promotion at work, talk about having kids. It helped that your wife was a little firecracker who made every time feel like the first time. You knew she appreciated you, and the fact that you could live comfortably without her having to work. That's right, things felt perfect. Almost too perfect. While you thought you knew everything about your wife, you didn't know what she did when you weren't home.\n\nAbout a year ago, the two of you got a dog. While she insisted on adopting and not supporting puppy mills, the two of you fell in love with a sweet, innocent golden retriever when you took her out to a farm, and the rest was history. The two of you named him Teddy, just because she liked the name, and Teddy he became. He got his shots and all, everything he needed, but he wasn't neutered. You saw no reason to put him through that pain, and you didn't plan on getting another dog, so you weren't worried about it. Teddy got to keep his balls, and life went on.\n\nYou both adored Teddy equally, and he adored you both the same. As time went on, though, he noticeably favoured your wife, which was understandable. She was the one who was home with him most of the time, who fed him, took him for walks, and everything. Not that he wasn't excited to see you, but after you were settled in each night, he would cuddle with your wife as opposed to you, bring the ball to her as opposed to you, and sleep at her feet as opposed to yours. You weren't jealous. Why would you be? He was only a dog.\n\nWhat you didn't know, though, was that your wife did more than feed him, take him for walks, and do things for a dog that an owner should do. It wasn't out of the ordinary for Teddy to hump things, but one day, Teddy ended up humping her, and now it happens every day. When you come home, your wife kisses you with the same lips that were wrapped around Teddy's cock only moments or hours earlier, depending on the day. When you two begin to get frisky, you don't realize that you're getting Teddy's sloppy seconds. You don't know the extent of the lengths that your wife goes for your dog, but one of these days, you're going to unintentionally find out.\n***\nIf you read the disclaimer and continued to read, I'm assuming you're interested. I'll give you a brief outline of what I see this story turning into, since I feel like the prompt is a little bit open for interpretation.\n\nYour character is not normally submissive, but one day, he finds his foxy, loving wife, taking it from their dog somewhere in the house and absolutely loving it. Maybe he stays out of view and watches in jealously and disbelief, but also he finds himself more turned on than anything else. Maybe he confronts his wife, but finds that the dog won't stop, even if he or she tries to get him to, and he's forced to watch his pup become locked into his wife. Either way, he will be angry and aroused, and he will find himself as his wife's secondary lover. But maybe he soon starts encouraging it. Maybe he uses this opportunity to try darker, more depraved things with her. Maybe he brings in other guys, finding he may have had this submissive side all along.\n\nIf this isn't the direction you see the prompt going, that's not a problem, because I'd still love to chat about it. I am, however, looking for someone who is willing to write more than just a few sentences per response. Talking about the environment around the characters, emotions, inner dialogues...I like detail, and I would like a partner who could provide this.\n\nI've probably said enough, so if you're still with me, thank you for getting this far and I look forward to hearing from you. If I lost you at some point along the way but you still like the way I think, you should still send me a message, because I'm up for much more than just this one scenario.",

            "selftext": "I down my fourth shot of vodka as I sit beside you on the couch. Once the shotglass is back on the table, I lean against your side and nibble my lip anxiously. This moment feels strange... You're the sweetest boyfriend anyone could ask for, and even now, I'm leaning against you for comfort, knowing that you always make me feel safe... Yet right now, even though I have to turn to you for encouragement, you're the source of my anxiety.\n\nI think back to a couple of hours ago, when the two of us had been at the bar with your friends, celebrating your birthday. Your friends are great. It seems like they hardly even notice that I'm one of the lago. It doesn't matter that I'm half your size, that I'm covered head to toe in chocolate-brown fur, or that I'm essentially  a universal sex-symbol; half rabbit, half woman. They see me as just another friend, just like you see me as your partner. You and all your friends see my personality first, and that means so much to me.\n\nIn any case, when you finally set aside the last gift, I'd stepped forward to offer my own. The other gifts had all been great and thoughtful, but they were objects. Mine was a simple card. I've always been bookish and a bit nerdy, so no one was terribly surprised when I handed you nothing more than a piece of folded, decorated paper.\n\nThe gift was what was written inside.\n\n&gt;To my best friend and lover,\n&gt;\n&gt;You mean the world to me. You treat me with respect, tenderness, care, and love. I couldn't ask for more. Of course, it certainly helps that you're... well... I find you very attractive. And you treat me right, *in and out of the bedroom.* ;)\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have to write in some lewd terms to give you your gift. To put it bluntly, you're *very* well endowed. So well, in fact, that when we first started dating, we had trouble even fitting you inside me. I'm sure you remember that. You were so gentle and careful with me. Now, it's no trouble at all, though as small as I am, I still get overwhelmed occasionally. At least I'm only overwhelmed in the most delightful way. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt;Let me cut to the chase. I know one of your kinks. A kink that you've had to put on hold for as long as we've been together. It just seems impossible, all things considered. But tonight, I want to change that. When we get home tonight, you'll find a huge bottle of the best lube I could find sitting on the coffee table, a pair of enema bottles (one filled with saline, the other with more lube), and a bottle of vodka. I'm going to get nice and clean for you, very wet, and very, *very* drunk. And then, I want you to be the first person I ever have anal sex with.\n&gt;\n&gt;You deserve it,\n&gt;\n&gt;Sarah\n\nI don't regret making that promise. It really is something I want to give you. But now, here I am. The saline bottle has been used up, so my body is as clean as a whistle. I'm sitting next to you, my fifth shot sitting on the table in front of us, and I'm already sloppy drunk. I've got a worried frown on my muzzle, because I know that no matter how slow and careful and sweet and tender you are with me tonight, *this is going to hurt.*\n\n---\n\nHey there, DPP! :D\n\nSo, to give a little tl;dr, I'll be playing an anthro bunny girl, about four feet tall, nerdy, and drunk, who's about to get fucked in her virgin ass with a dick the size of her forearm. ;9\n\nSome of the kinks I'm looking to satisfy tonight are pretty obvious, but I'll list them all out just to cover my bases.\n\nKinks: painal, size difference, a touch of romance, drunk sex (with an at least mostly sober partner), furry, abdominal bulges\n\nLimits: scat, blood, bathroom-stuff, etc. You get the gist of it. :P\n\nSo if this interests you, shoot me a message! Oh, and by the way, I've got a semi-nsfw reference image for my character, if you're interested.\n\nHope to hear from you all!",

            "selftext": "2028; The discovery of magic on Earth. This, as well the advance of technology, had propelled humanity to great new heights. But overpopulation had caused humanity to urgently find solutions, and one solution was colonisation of the stars. Sol was quickly terraformed and colonised, and the population crisis was at halt. Still, the curiosity couldn't be sated, not for a moment, nor could the greed. Humanity's grasp extended, and pushed out, spreading from solar system to solar within just a short amount of time. The usage of magic increased, at first treated with suspicion, now commonly used amongst everyone, from doctors, to bored teenagers. \n\n2128, on the anniversary of the discovery of magic, the United Governments of Earth (UGE) decided to impart on their greatest mission yet. 5 Million people, loaded into sleeper ships, made up of various nation alliances (Franco-Iberian-Italian Alliance, the Sino-Japanese-Korean Collective, etc) and sent to one of our closest galaxies, Messier 81, to colonise and spread the power of humanity even further. All highly trained, each single person serving a purpose, this was the elite of the planet. Many prayed for God to look over their journey, not knowing that something similar, something far sinister would answer their prayers.\n\nWe called them Divine, split between the Angelus and the Demonus. \n\nTwo days after the sleeper ship UGE Basilica was sent deep into space, disaster struck. The link to Earth was severed. It was found out that the Demonus, the more destructive and demonic of the two races, had destroyed Earth, and all of it's colonies, in such a sudden and fast swoop, that the ship sleepers didn't even realise before it was too late. Lost, stranded in space, in was the Angelus who took pity on them, and help carried them to their new destination, their new world. But like the Tower of Babel before us, for unknown reasons, they divided the crew up. By using the utmost powerful magic, each national group, as it were, of the ship was sent to different planets, across different systems, all within the same Galaxy. Given only a small amount of technology to survive on, and the knowledge of Earth still fresh in their minds, the new colonists decided to endure and build on.\n\nColonisation. It was supposed to take a few years at best. But population levels were so critically low, that that never came about. What resulted was a complete restart of civilisation, for each of these groups, and then, evolution. They had to adapt to survive, not just mentally, but physically. Every aspect of their lives had been destroyed, and as such, a new civilisation would rise from each one. The planets they were stuck on would change them. Years went on, and years.. Thousands and thousands of years, in fact. The magic on said planets (and radiation, for some) was so powerful that is sped the evolution process faster than usual.\n\nAlthough they would be more 'socially' set back than previous generations (comparable to Medieval times even), their magic and technology was even greater. FTL, Improved weaponry, cybernetics, an increased understanding of magic. Of course, not all the Humanities, as they would be known, were equal in this regard, some 'lagging' behind, so to speak. Earth was totally forgotten, new civilisations were built, with new religions, new thoughts and different people. That was until, however, that the planets all began to meet each other again. Though they never learnt of their shared common history, the races of Humans could tell they were related at least. War would consume them, then peace, then coalition. It has been 300 years since that day, and now the Human Alliance, as it was known, grew strong together.\n\nBut Humans weren't the only species in this galaxy. Elves, Beastmen, Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves, Gnomes, Forrest Nymphs, and more were here long before the humans. The Itika, the Sla'Gorns too, and even secret and ancient races, more ancient and powerful than the Divine themselves. Contact day. Another important day in history, was when a majority of the races in the galaxy would meet, or formally do so at least. Elves, Dwarves, Greenskins and Gnomes had long had history between each other, and as such, this day is more so to commemorate the meeting of the Humans and the Natives of the Galaxy. Wars were fought, battles were made, but the races stand at a peace... For now.\n\nDagonah. A huge planet, and home world to three species, Dagonah represented a jewel in a harsh system, a planet filled with life, and opportunity. And *everyone* had an interest here. Dagonah had a reputation for being the place where someone could make it. As such, it was a treasure cove for adventurers, businessmen, and pirates alike. Just about everyone was trying to get a piece of land, but not wanting an outright war. Hence, a cold war began, fought by mercs and adventurers alike, hired by various alliances. But what none of these foolish races know was the truth of Dagonah, nor what was hidden deep within the planet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Setting:**\n Dagonah is a rich planet, filed with diverse life, species and landmasses, mostly though it is oceanic with various islands, ranging from large to small islands (to our standards anyway, remember that Dagonah is five times the size of Earth), containing vast deserts, jungles, forests, artic wastelands, tropical islands, temperate fields, harsh mountains, bumpy hills, underground systems, fertile aquatic reefs and more. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Races:**\n\n*Humans:*\n\nSome of the most common races, taking up quite a lot of the galaxy, were Humans. Their difference were mostly cultural, political and technological, although magic was a factor as well.\n\nThe Mercator: Quick thinking, noble, ambitious and imperial in nature. The Mercator are the jack of all trades of Humans, which, as a result, leads to them being the most powerful sub-race. Skilled in trade, building, culture, tactics and fighting, the Mercator resemble old Rome or France. The Mercator tend to be very faithful and believe strongly in the Divine. The Mercator are ruled by a Parliamentary Kingdom, with a strong basis in Democracy.\n\nThe Yami: Isolationist, secretive, proud and alien to most. The Yami are masters of espionage, discrete technology and hidden knowledge. Unlike the other races, the Yami prefer to keep to themselves, and as such, make up the smallest percentage of the Alliance. Advanced in technology, and preferring to fight in the dark, the Yami are seen as untrustworthy to most. The Yami have their own religion based on ancestor worship and spirits. They are Asian in appearance, being the remnant of the Sino-Japanese-Korean collective, as such. The Yami is ruled by a sole ruler and his/her council.\n\nThe Voin: Tough, powerful, intimidating and rude, is just some of the words to describe the Voin. The most military-like of the Humans, they are tall, strong, with light hair and eyes, and focus on one thing and one thing only. Battle. Every single Voin is conscripted when the age comes, as such, they have the most imposing and powerful military of them all, with the tech to back them up. Seen often as thugs, the Voin are a cultural people who just happen to place battle as a high importance. The Voin originate from Russia's crew, as well as other Eastern European countries. The Voin are run by a Stratocracy, with little freedom. As such, many leave to find their own destiny in the stars. The Voin are largely irreligious.\n\nThe Isf\u00f8dt: Similar to their Voinish cousins, the Isf\u00f8dt love fighting and battle, the difference being however, that an Isf\u00f8dt doesn't need someone to tell him/her to fight, it's in born! Drinking is a must, as well as grand tales, dancing, singing and poetry. The Isf\u00f8dt are as cultured as they are violent, as independent as they are powerful. Unsurprisingly, the Isf\u00f8dt make naturally great pirates, and their space ships are second to none amongst all the humans. The Isf\u00f8dt have a simple, almost tribal-like government, that is surprisingly very democratic and fair. The Isf\u00f8dt believe mostly in their own religion, a mixture of pagan gods and goddesses.\n\nThe Magier: Quiet, stoic, scholarly, intelligent. The Magier, formed from the Central German Republic's crew, are perhaps the most naturally inborn with not just technology, but magic also, and it is a combination of both that had made the sub-race such a powerful group.  The Magier are proud, wise beyond their years, pale with various hair and eye colours, and have an inborn intelligence. Magier are meritocratic to the core, as such, they do not believe in electing leaders, but for leaders to rise when they are most capable of most qualified, leading to them being something of a Technocracy as well. Despite their technology, The Magier are quite pious and are defenders of the Divine faith (as well as the Mercator), many of them becoming paladins.\n\nThe Alqamar: The Alqamar descend from a powerful coalition of Middle Eastern and North African countries, what in the past would be seen as a the Arab countries. The Alqamar are faithful people, believe also in the Divine faith, but their own interpretation of it, mixed with their own native beliefs (which often cause them to butt heads with devout Divinists such as Mercators and Magiers). Alqamar are masters of trade, culture, religion and sciences, but above all, they are deeply magical.  Alqamars, similar to the Mercator, are a mix bag, capable of doing many things well, their military is rather lacking, however, although they make up for it with their powerful faith based magic. The Alqamar are ruled by a Theocracy, which controls a set of royal families under their control.\n\nThe Kabilans: Making up one of the largest in population of the Alliance, second only to the Mercator, the Kabilans are African in origins, and are positive, life affirming people, with strong emphasis on family, love and culture. The Kalibans are capable of both magic and physical war, also being rather spiritual in their use, although they have a less organised structure of religion. Shamans and beast masters are common amongst the Kabilans. Despite this, the Kabilans are still modernised, their government consisting of a Federal Democracy, though it took a long time to get such a stable government. Kabilans are the most mixed when it comes to religion, some are devout Divinists, other reject religion, and others follow the Alqamar's faith. However, many pay attention to their original and long-ago tribal faiths, and the Kabilans are known to be superstitious and spiritual.\n\nThe Roshanee: Finally the Roshanee. If the Magier are the most talented at technology, then the Roshanee are the opposite. Peaceful and nature loving, the Roshanees, originating from a mixture of Indian and Tibetan governments, are deeply magical and spiritual, their religion a mixture of old world eastern philosophies and faiths. Roshanees are anarchic, in a sense, in that they do not have any governments, amazingly, their cities manage to rune without having anyone to tell them what to do. This is because Roshanees are so magically gifted that each one is connected to each other, capable of feeling each other's pain, love and sense of self. As a result, the Roshanee people are very monk like, although this does not mean they are incapable of defending themselves, quite the opposite, but it does mean they would rather use peace as a tactic over war. In battle, they are known for their mystic spells and monk like fighting.\n\n*Elves*\n\nThe Elves are a race that were more magically evolved than the average human, as such, have taken on a more extreme appearance, with their own abilities and cultures. Elves tend to be haughty, but wise, and are amongst the most powerful magic users in the galaxy. All elves used to be part of one civilisation, but split some thousands of years ago and evolved into their own sub-species.\n\nHigh Elves: The original, as they say, of the elves. High and mighty, wise and magical, their culture and home world is one of unspoilt beauty, of great architecture and music, and intense knowledge. The High Elves are the most magically gifted of all elves, and pride themselves on their civilisation. They consider themselves moral and pure. They tend to be pale to tanned, with long light hair, elongated ears, slender builds and tall height. They worship the Angelus, similar to some Humans. They have advanced, magical powered technology.\n\nDark Elves: Almost the complete opposite to the High Elves in every way. Their culture is one of degeneracy and sadism, evil and hatred. They are similar in build, but have dark, ash like skin, ranging from pitch black, to violet to grey, with glowing red eyes. They are a mixture of magical and physical prowess, making them very feared. Many become pirates, kidnapping victims and breaking them into their pets. Slavery is not just common for Dark elves, but is a part of their culture. They worship Demonus, and all the evil they bring. Their technology is much less magical powered and more 'industrious' and dirty,\n\nWood Elves: Neither majestic or pious, nor degenerate and evil, Wood elves could be considered the more tribal of the three, and more innocent in a way. They lack magical skills as we know it, but are skilled in the magic of nature, as they worship nature as well. Nimble and shorter than Dark and High elves, with tanned to dark skin and long, darkish hair, the Wood elves are the friendliest of the three, and are often aligned with the Forrest Folk, despite not being too related.\n\n*Greenskins*\n\nAn unfortunate and unpleasant name, Greenskins are often the most discriminated people in the galaxy, second only to the Beastmen, and are treated poorly. They suffer as second class citizens, and are considered to be culturally, racially and intellectually inferior to the 'civilised' species. However, this isn't necessarily true. Orcs are tribal, strong and spiritual, Goblins are inquisitive and curious with technology, and trolls make up for natural shamans and hunters. Although they are only just catching up with other civilisation, Greenskin's drive and tenacity make up for their 'inferior' qualities. Many become involved in crime, although their is talk of organisation between the races of something big soon. Giants and Ogres make up this faction too, although they actually are intellectually inferior, but make up for it with brute strength. Greenskins are sporadic in faith but tend to be shamanistic.\n\n*Dwarves and Gnomes*\n\nClosely linked but still distant enough to be separate, Dwarves and Gnomes have a closely linked relationship and have historically been governed together. All Dwarves are incapable of magic, although Gnomes make great mages.\n\nMountain Dwarf: The mountain Dwarf is the most common of all Dwarfs. Lovers of treasure, drinking, mining and weaponry, they are known to make homes within mountains and prefer the cold weather to warm. Pale with bright hair, the mountain Dwarf make up the majority of most dwarves. They live alongside gnomes, who help invent new technologies for them to use and destroy with, under a long lasting Kingdom, with various Gnomes and Dwarves alike having been kings and queens of said lines. They are faithful, and believe in the divine like some elves and humans.\n\nHill Dwarf: More independent and free-thinking than their mountaineering cousins, Hill Dwarves prefer hilly, grass landscapes, their home made underground but not *too* underground. They are less industrious than their cousins, and prefer nature, and are surprisingly shamanistic, very few believing in the Divine faith. They are famous for their griffons, even now in this technological era, and very rarely leave their planets and colonies. They are tribal based, but have strong connections to gnomes and Mountain Dwarves alike.\n\nDark Dwarf: A dirty name in the Dwarven kingdom. Dark Dwarves, similar to Dark Elves, are Dwarves which have been lulled over the the dark side of the Demonus. They are sadistic, cruel, and thirst for power. Their technologies are fuelled by slave labour and they well known for their weapons of mass destruction. Never, *never* trust a Dark Dwarf. \n\nGnomes: Loveable and small, the friendly and eccentric gnomes are responsible for some of the most important scientific breakthroughs in the history of the galaxy, the Gnomes struggle to fight on the physical front, but their magic is strong, and their technology is even stronger. Some call them a 'guest race' under the Dwarves, but the truth is the two races have an in-depth and close relationship, almost closer than any other races in the galaxy.\n\n*Beastmen:* Beastmen can take a wide range of appearances, and different sub-races can govern their strength, magical capabilities and qualities. The Bull like ones, for example, are known for their strength, and the Goat looking ones known as leaders and shaman. Brutal, scary and down right ugly, most humans are lucky to never see a Beastman. Barely intelligible, they exist to plunder, rape, kill, torture and sleep. They are tribal in beliefs, but it's suspected they are secretly lead by the Demonus.\n\n*Itika:* Wise, solitary and brooding, the Itika, insulting called \"Bird Men\" are one of the three natives of the planet of Nagadoh. Itika are known for their kingdoms in the sky, their flying capability and amazing marksman's skills. They are not as technologically capable as other races, but enough to be able to stand their own. Spiritual, although without magic, the Itika are proud, believe strongly in family and traditions, and prefer to keep to themselves. Itika have their own, ancestor based faiths.\n\n*Sla'gorn:* Unlike their neighbours, the foul and wretched Sla'gorns. Slimly, fat, most do not even want to look at them. They resemble Toads quite closely, although upright and very large, Sla'gorns are greedy bastards, willingly to sell their own mothers if it made them a profit. Another native of Nagadoh, and long time rivals of the Itika, the Sla'gorn are less battle, and focus more on trade and industry. As such, the Sla'gorns a fair chunk of the planet, their home continent and swampy place, now a huge industrial wasteland. Despite this, not all Sla'gorns are greedy, nor cowardly either, as many are quite capable of ready soldiers. \n\n*Ryzul:* The Ryzul are much less animal looking than the other two natives of Nagadoh, resembling mermaids more than anything, their colours ranging from blues to pink to greys and violets. Where as the Itikas live in the sky, the Sla'gorns in the swamps, the Ryzul live deep within the ocean, as such, making the highest amount of the population of the planet. They are capable of living outside of the ocean for an amount of time, and much longer if equipped with water tanks, but are otherwise solely aquatic. Their cities are grand and beautiful, glass and golden towers built from the bottom of the sea. The Ryzul are also believers in the Angelus, and are very devout in their faith. Magical also, and skilled with a trident, they are equally dangerous as they are beautiful.\n\n*Arachnids:* Somewhere between civilised and animalistic, the Arachnids care little for the affairs of others, save if they are hungry, or need a mate. Entirely male except for one female every colony, Arachnids hide deep within the forrest and jungles of Nagadoh. They resemble giant spiders with lower halfs spider, and up half human-like. They are secretive, manipulative, capable of powerful nature-based magic and some darker. Most are not evil, and are just wanting to protect their family (quite literally, they're all brothers save for their mother). Powerful and fast, you do not want to get on their bad side. Rarely seen in civilisation, but are rumoured to have a secret, underground civilisation.\n\n*The Divine &amp; Demonic*\n\nVery, very little is known about this race, and even few people have ever met one. Considered a myth by most, or a faith by others, the two races of this group, Angelus and Demonus, good and evil, are extremely powerful and advance, both in science and technology, although they tend to be very few in numbers.\n\nAngelus: Angels, literal angels. Powerful beyond belief, and pure, the Angelus are amongst the most ancient of races. There is still so little we know, in fact, not a single person *truly* believe they exist, but they are always out there, watching over the faithful...\n\nDemonus: The opposite. Evil, feeding off the energy of sadism and cruelty, misery and suffering, the Demonus are amongst the most disgusting and horrible creatures in the universe, their twisted demonic figures the complete opposite to the pure beauty of an Angelus. But make no mistake, if you ever cross and Demonus, you are either surely going to die, or find a fate worst than death.\n\n*Dragons*\n\nAnother one of the three, rare and ancient races, going as far back as the beginning of time, are the Dragons. Powerful in every way, the motive of the Dragons is unknown to us, or if they even exist. They are suited better for stories for children  than reality,  but they do linger out there, as little as we know. Scaly and large, reptile like in nature, they can range from the size of a ship to huge, impossible sizes. Incredibly wise and inclined with magic, the Dragons seem much more neutral than the Angelus and Demonus, and as such, we still don't know what they want. Reports lately, however, have arisen of strange looking men and women, tall and strong, incredibly potent at magic, who look strangely reptile in nature...\n\n\n*Vampires*\n\nEven in this galaxy, the curse of the dreaded vampire continues. Thought to be a 'gift' given by an unknown Demonus lord, or maybe a genetic infection, the result is the same. Evil, thought to be anyway, and incredibly powerful and immortal, the Vampires of the galaxy are not a specific race per se, as near any race can become a vampire. But they are split into different factions, or \"families\" as they are known. Most vampires are killed on sight, but lucky for them, they are masters of infiltrating society, and taking what they want.\n\nNorthern Family: The Northern Family are the most powerful wizards of the Vampires Families. They drive on blood magic, unturned ancient runes and the suffering of overs to fuel their twisted arcane powers\n\nEastern Family: The Eastern Family are known more for their stealth abilities, and speed, many being able to kill their victims without ever being spotted. They are swift predators, sometimes preferring to use their claws over their teeth and magic to slay their prey.\n\nWestern Family: The Western Family are known more for their intense strength, the muscle which is fed by the blood of their victims. Capable of crushing fists with a slight slap, these monsters are freaks of power\n\nSouthern Family: Where as the last three families are known for their speed, strength and magic alike, the Southern Family is different in that they prefer to avoid conflict, and use a very advance kind of magic. Seduction. Mind games, they are the masters of illusionary magic and tricking. They may not seem it, but they are truly the most dangerous, and charming, of the four.\n\n*Werewolves*\n\nSimilar to the Vampires, the Werewolves are not a specific race, but more so a curse. Where as the Vampires are cursed by Demonic magic, the Werewolf is cursed by the twisted shamanic magic of the Beastmen, in order to make their victims into them. This rarely succeeds however, as Werewolves often do two things. One, go feral, and kill everything on sight, or two, retain their humanity, or sanity at least, and either go alone in the world, or join a pack. A pack is similar to a family, since Werewolves are so discriminated, and look out for each other, many starting mercenary bands. The Brotherhood is the governing body of all Packs, albeit unofficial. Most go alone, however, forever cursed, forever doomed a miserable life, excelling only in one thing. Killing. Werewolves are extremely powerful, capable of tearing their targets to shred, and with intense sense of smell, sight and hearing, they are born predators.\n\n*Forrest Folk*\n\nForrest Folk, as they are condescendingly called, are the Children of the Forrest, making up of Ents, Centaurs, Satyrs and various Fae. They are skilled in the magic of nature, and have a close relationship with the Wood Elves. Forrest Folk are sentient, but are technologically behind, modern aged luddites which shun technology for the embrace of the woods, still, you see an odd one in a city every now and then. They are generally peaceful, unless you attempt to harm them or the land.\n\n*Tekniks*\n\nTekniks are another what you could call ancient 'race', although if you considered them a race or not would be hard to say. Tekniks, quite simply, are machines. More accurately, they are robots, some androids, and have existed long before the elves were born or humans ever reached the galaxy. No one is quite sure where they came from, including Tekniks themselves. All Tekniks have suffered from a memory wipe from long ago, meaning they do not know their origins or their owners. All they know is that they are capable of thinking, dreaming, even loving, like a human can. Surprisingly, Tekniks are often accepted into society, as they are often friendly, supportive and non-violent. However, you do get the odd Teknik warrior here and then. Tekniks are also consisted of Androids, the more human looking of the group, and some rift exists between them. \n\n*Morta*\n\nA old time spooky tale for the children, most would say, or a victim or Necromancy? This is the undead, the general undead, but there is a specific faction of them, the walking dead, who are not just mindless zombies, but retain their minds and sanity, but at the sake of their humanity. They are known as Morta. Morta do not make up a race, so to speak, you can be an Undead Human, or Elf, and so on. A Morta is simply an undead which has their own mind, and is situated within the group known as the Morta. Looked down on at best, and hated at worst, hunted to the edge of society, the Morta keep to themselves, often living on Dead Worlds due to their lack of need for eating, sleeping or drinking.\n\n*Forgotten Ones*\n\nFinally. The Forgotten Ones. They are the void, the primal mess of life that cries out for power and existence. They exist only in the deepest oceans of planets, in the deepest core of a galaxy, in the darkest crevice of a cave, hidden from all, waiting for their time to strike. They once ruled the entire galaxy long ago, but they were struck down, forced to hide. Now, they use their servants for their biddings, the Kadishtas, mind controlled slaves who have been genetically altered to serve them. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Classes:**\n\n*Barbarian*\nThe Barbarian is the untamed warrior, the man/woman with the crazy axe, the lover of battle and of freedom. They are often two to one handed, although can use firearms, and wear light armour.\n\nShaman: The Shaman is the more spiritually focused Barbarian, summoning the spirits to help battle their foes as well as casting both spiritual and elemental damage. Their are still handy with a weapon, however. Shamans are also capable of healing.\n\nBeast Master: The Beast Master is capable of controlling beasts to their own whim, and have a strong connection with animals. When starting, they usually only have one or two animals, but can soon amass a large pack, some as big of an army.\n\nBerserker: The Berserker is the Barbarian on rage inducing steroids. Able to destroy anything in their path, they are an unstoppable freak of nature, unable to feel pain in their enraged state.\n\n*Bard*\nCapable of raising the spirits (and buffs) of their allies, tricking their foes and taunting them into a blind rage, the Bard uses their power of song, word and seduction to gain control of the battlefield.\n\nDancer: And for the Dancer, we take the Seduction to the max. The Dancer, whenever fighting against the opposite sex (or the same sex that is attracted to that sex) is capable of seducing with hypnotic dancing grooves, a mix of discrete magic and pure physical attraction, to get their foe to do what they want.\n\nMime: The Mime's main, and only, ability is the ability to completely mimic their enemy's fighting style and strength. This doesn't seem so useful at first, but combined with tactical knowledge and the back up of a team and the mime can become extremely dangerous.\n\n*Druid*\nLovers of natures, dwellers of the woods. Druids use the power of nature to heal, shape shift and cause damage. More often than not, Druidism is associated with the Forrest Folk, Wood Elves and a few other species.\n\nShape Shifter: This Druid can transform into any animal they desire and use said form for either battle, travel, or other reasons.\n\nHealer: A Healer uses the power of nature to heal their comrades and themselves, as well as the world around them.\n\nElementist: The Elementist uses the power of nature to destroy their enemy's, calling on the strength of earth, wind, fire (best funk group of all time) and water to destroy any opponent.\n\n*Soldier*\nThe Soldier uses heavy rifles and other destructive weaponry to rain hellfire on their enemies. They often wear heavy armour, and are well versed in tactics and strategies.\n\nMercenary: The Mercenary will use any means possible to get the job done. Guns, gadgets, torture devices, snipers, this is the person you want to hire to get a job done.\n\nHeavy Weapons Expert: A Mercenary will get the job done. A heavy weapons expert will blow that job into tiny smithereens. Armed with the most powerful weaponry money can buy such as rocket launchers, mini-guns and heavy laser equipment, these monsters are a sight to see on the battlefield.\n\n*Priest*\nPriests come in all shapes and sizes, races and faiths, but are usually people who use their faith and faith based magic both as a healing tool and a weapon. The most basic priest is capable of healing only, before moving to move advance stages\n\nScholar: The Scholar is not only capable of healing friends, but using devastating faith magic against their foes, which is extra effective against those of the 'Dark' variant or aligned with Demonus.\n\nInquisitor: Unlike the Scholar who uses faith magic to defeat their enemies, the Inquisitor isn't afraid to get a little dirty. Using the power of their enemies to use right against them, the Inquisitor will do anything to wipe out demon scum from the planet, even if it means using that very same magic.\n\n*Monk*\nThe monk, similar to the Priest, uses their faith based magic to aid them, although theirs is more mystic and meditative based then on prayer. Monks forsake weaponry, using only their hands and mystic magic to get the job done, and very rarely due to they kill.\n\nMystic: The Mystic uses a magic unique to Monk's, which allow them to see and feel the battlefield, and all them around them, capable of manipulating pressure points in the body of a living being, and even seeing the future for a short moment. A very powerful figure.\n\nBlack Belt: A Black Belt will look at the gun of a soldier or rifle of a Marksman and just laugh. With their fists alone, the Monk is capable of some truly destructive damage, a well trained black belt can easily punch through solid steel and then some.\n\n*Knight*\nA symbol of honour and chivalry, the Knight exists even in this time of hi-tech weaponry and armour, the Knight simply had to get even. With power energy blades and thick, dense armour, the Knight is capable of taking punishment and destroying evil with a swift strike. Inspire awe and terror in equal measure.\n\nPaladin: The Paladin represent all that is good in the universe. Just, kind, and glowing with holy, faith magic, the Paladin can heal themselves and their allies, use said magic against evil all while using their superior strength and endurance to crush foes.\n\nDark Knight: But that same power can easily be turned to the dark side, sadly. The Dark Knight uses the evil magic of the Demonus to corrupt and destroy friends and foes alike, summoning twisted creatures to the battlefield and feed off the energy of the living to heal themselves.\n\nDragoon: The Dragoon is a mount focused knight who uses a lance to strike at their enemies. These days, the mounts can range from a horse (not too likely for a battlefield) to the more sensible and heavy armoured hover-bikes. Swift, powerful and brutal, they'll never see you coming.\n\n*Marksman*\nA Marksman is a simple term used for someone who is just really, really good with a gun. Save maybe some rare tribals who uses bow and arrow's still, the gun is the most common weapon in the galaxy, and those who master the weapon, master the galaxy.\n\nGunslinger: The Gunslinger doesn't need a long rifle to get their enemy, nor need to be miles enemy. They prefer two blasters, one for each hand, to whittle away at their enemy with razor sharp precision and speed. Deadly in a bar fight.\n\nSniper: Of course, the Sniper has quite the different opinion. Armed with the heaviest and deadliest rifle you could buy, hiding in the background, the Sniper is the number one cause of death of idiots who sneak their heads around corners. \n\n*Rogue*\nA rogue is a sort of generic term for any roguish character. Rogues don't (always) rely on spells of brute force to win the fight. They use guile, agility, their street smarts and their charm to get the job done.\n\nAssassin: Deadly and deceptive, the Assassin in similar to a Mercenary in that they'll do anything to get the job done. However, an Assassin has more loose \"morals\" when it comes to doing this. Poison, seduction, blackmail, sniping, dirty tricks, nothing is against the assassin's code. If it pays well, they'll do it.\n\nThief: The Thief is less damage focused as some of the other classes and more focused on stealing and profits. Doesn't seem to useful in a fight, but when the enemy loses their guns, their pants and their will to fight, you can thank the thief. Just don't let them near your wallet.\n\nGambler: The Gambler is a fool. They'll always bet agains the house, *and win*, then they'll bet against the house, and lose. The Gambler uses that same \"all-or-nothing\" mentality in a fight. Using chance as a weapon, these fools are as unpredictable as they are dangerous.\n\nNinja: A Speciality of the Yami, the Ninja is just as capable as infiltration as an Assassin would be, or hiding in the dark as a Thief would be, but prefer not to use guns but instead Energy blades based off ancient Katanas and Shirukens too.\n\n*Technologist*\nThe Technologist tends not to be a naturally tough person nor magically capable. Instead, they use technology for their weapons of choice. Heavily armoured, armed with hacking weapons, magnetic guns and syringes, they're eccentric but deadly.\n\nHacker: In this day and age, technology is everywhere. Our ships, our cities, our computers, our guns and even our armour, and all of that can easily be accessed by an advanced hacker. Wether their throwing themselves in the virtual world or blowing up a command centre with a simple code, Hackers are often under appreciated.\n\nTechnowizard: The Technowizard is a dangerous, if unstable, sight on the battlefield, perfected only be a few, such as the Magier. Magic and Technology, together in beautiful, mad harmony. Electricity in their speciality.\n\nMedic: Using the power of technology to heal instead of kill, the Medic is a sort for sore eyes for any soldier on the field. Armed with the most powerful medicine in modern history, they can boost an allies abilities, health, and give them special buffs too.\n\nChemist: In a perversion of medicine, the Chemist decides to do the exact opposite. Armed with a sleek syringe gun, the Chemist shoots bolts of acid upon their enemies, or injects them with maddening drugs that turn them on their enemies, or a hypnotic ray, well, you get the picture.\n\n*Mage*\nThe mage is perhaps the most values asset in any fight. Although often vulnerable and weak, the power they hold is beyond any kind of measure. Capable of destruction, healing, controlling and transporting all with great ease, the Mage is rarely something someone wants to mess with.\n\nWizard: An expert at 'general' magic, the Wizard can cast spells with the best of them, open portals even turn their foes into sheep. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes terrifying, it's never a dull day with a Wizard.\n\nNecromancy: A practice banned by most races, Necromancy is a foul magic that turns the dead into allies for a necromancer to use. Friends, family, no subject is too low or personal for the Necromancer to use. Advance Necromancers are capable of stiching the dead together to make even more disgusting beasts, not carrying for a second about their pain. Approach with extreme caution.\n\nSummoner: If a Wizard casts spells, a Necromancer raises the dead, then what does a Summoner do? Well, they summon! Summoners bring powerful monsters, beasts, spirits and other allies to the field to fight on their behalf. Underestimated in terms of power, Advance Summoners can summons entire armies worth of monsters to fight for them.\n\nWarlock: Similar to Necromancy, most Warlock magic has been banned. While the Inquisitor used demon magic for a positive purpose, the Warlock cares only for their own power.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Character Creation:**\n\nName: (What is your character's name?)\nAge: (What is your character's age?)\nSex: (What is your character's sex?)\nRace: (What is your character's race?

I know this is essay length and i'm sorry but I really wanted to make something quite in-depth for the both of us to enjoy &lt;3 This idea has been on my mind for a while now so i'm glad to finally write it out. The idea is for a strong background for basically anything to happen! Please feel free to add your own ideas also! I wanted it so there's a whole world for you to create a character in, instead of having a \"specific fetish = specific scene\" scenario like most RPs are, I wanted to make a world where anything could happen. \n\nWe can do bimbofication, we can do BDSM, we can do Romance, we can do Rape, we can do a wide range of fucked up stuff. Scenes can include Spaceship romance! An Alien brothel! Organised crime, a mysterious race waiting to be discovered, the battle between countries, a tale of a Knight and their fall, and so on. Ambitious, I know, so i'm looking for other ambitious people too! Hope you've enjoyed reading :-) I'll post my personal DPP profile below.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/7whhb8/20fdm4a_good_stories_make_me_horny/",

            "selftext": "The new Goo toy. It was advertised a lot on porn sites along with dick enlarging pills and sex toys. But this was far more advanced. It was a lump of smart goo. It was essentially about a pound of pink, green, purple, or black slime that could be used for nearly anything! \n\nPressing it to a cock would make it take the shape of the tightest fleshlight, and left alone, would stroke the cock until orgasm.\n\nWhen in contact with a pussy, it will automatically change into the largest toy it can, or the person's preferred shape. If left alone at that point, it will fuck said pussy until orgasm.\n\nThe ass will also turn the goo into a the shape of a cock, however if its against a male ass, a full strapon harness will form for a female to use too!\n\nHeres where it gets interesting however. When the goo is pressed to someone's ear it pushes into their head to their brain and begins to drain the victims intelligence. If pressed against the nose, the creature will disappear into the victim and take control of their mind and body. \n\n~~~~\n\nIm looking for people interested in this! Id love to use it on strangers, my friends, my girlfriend whoever!",

He's not very good for it, but is willing to try and posts online.\n\nYou take an interest, perhaps befriend him and give him advice. But you're really plotting to have me for yourself!\n\nYou suggest that you could teach him some in real life after a while - but on a few conditions. He blindfolds me and gets me in doggy style before silently tying himself to a chair. You enter and I have no idea you're not my husband....\n\nAnd that's where we start!\n\nKinks here will be: Calling my young dom Daddy. Cucking. Would love some forced bi/chastity/feminisation with my son/husband. Forced rimming. Making me into your pet. Maybe forced lesbianism/incest with my young daughter. Bondage. Punishment. Watersports. Multiple partners.... Actually pretty much anything except:\n\nLimits: Scat, Vomit, Gore\n\nPlease tell me how your ideal MILF looks - pics are fantastic, words work! Also the age you'll play. Otherwise dive in with your arrival!\n\nMy name is Lina for this play.\n\n___\n\n**Option 2 - Mother caught watching daughter and her dominant boyfriend**\n\nAnd ends up becoming their sub!\n\nKinks here will be: Forced lesbianism/rimming. Bondage. Punishment. Watersports. Multiple partners.... Actually pretty much anything except:\n\nLimits: Scat, Vomit, Gore\n\n___\n\nI have been noticing my daughter get more and more bruises, and I want to find out why. One day I hide and watch what happens. It turns out that her bully is her Dom! He makes her do all sorts of stuff (same kinks as me) and in the wardrobe I'm masturbating to how hot it is.\n\nHe hears me, finds me, and makes me his slut.\n\nI can either be equal to my daughter, or a sub below you and her.\n\nIdeally this ends up cucking my husband and stuff but I'll discuss that later!\n\n**At the start of the RP I'll be in the wardrobe - we'll do a few messages of me watching before I give myself away! Don't start with you already discovering me!**",

            "selftext": "\"Abby, this is *crazy!*\" I can hear under the exasperation and anxiety in my voice the thinnest thread of excitement, and I don't like it. \"I'm going to get arrested, indecent exposure or something -- \"\n\nAbby made a derisive snort and tossed her dreadlocks back into as tidy a cable as she could manage as she continued work on her canvas -- that is to say, me. \"Are you kidding me, sunshine? This is downright modest compared to some of the other stuff that'll be on display out there this weekend. Trust me, if the cops can't be bothered to shut down all the mobile pharmacies and smoke shops, they're not going to give a sweet shit about your cute ass.\"\n\nShe gives my cute -- if a little soft -- ass a smack. I wince. It doesn't feel bad ... in fact it feels pretty goddamn good ... but it does seem more sensitive than usual. Maybe it's the paint. More likely it's my imagination. I wonder for the hundredth time how I let Abby talk me into this. She's always been the oddest of my friends, but despite that -- maybe because of it -- she's also been the closest. Outgoing where I'm shy; outrageous where I'm reserved; a tree-slobbering hippy where I'm a buttoned down conservative; and, of course, cheerfully bisexual while I've always been straight as an arrow.\n\nOkay, there was that one time we made out in college, but it never went anywhere and I couldn't look her in the eye for the next three weeks. She, of course, merely collapsed into giggles whenever it was mentioned. \n\nBut one thing I can say for her -- she always knows when to swoop in and cheer me up. So when my marriage, already on the rocks, sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic along with the *Titanic*, she was on my doorstep within a week of the divorce papers being signed, handing me a brand new knapsack and a backstage pass to the Widening Gyre Festival. \"It's just what you need,\" she insisted, quite deliberately not giving me time to think. \"You've been all caged up and locked away for much too long. Go wild for a few days, why not?\"\n\nWhy not? At least it wasn't Burning Man. And as Abby pointed out, I was always a Yeats fan. \"Not that nine tenths of the people there will get *that* joke,\" she grinned, a merry and mischievous gleam in her eye. I should have known not to trust that little gleam -- it always spelled trouble.\n\nSo here I was shivering in nothing but a much too small thong and a spiked leather collar, hands stretched over my head like a figure on a Grecian urn, the tarpaulin that covered the floor of Abby's pavilion (closed to the public at the moment, thank god) splattered with white and orange and black splashes of paint, a Jackson Pollock frenzy of a tiger. And a rather more convincing tiger glaring at her former best friend. \"You're nuts! Give me a jacket or a sweater or something, ok? I mean this is ridiculous -- \"\n\n\"No, this is *Art.*\" I could hear the capital A. \"You agreed to be my entry into the living canvas contest, and I am sick of taking home the second place ribbon. And you'll make much more of an impression if you're out there on the hunt as much as you can be -- as much as you *want* to be.\" \n\n\"I thought competition was a tool of the pig patriarchy?\"\n\n\"Not when I win, it isn't. Now hold still.\" She knelt down behind me, her slender brushes teasing at the backs of my thighs, putting finishing touches on my stripes. Involuntarily, I shivered. Despite my protests, this whole process had aroused the hell out of me, and I had no doubt Abby knew it. Kneeling down at my feet, turning my legs into the powerful hindquarters of a bipedal tigress, she could probably *smell* it.\n\nI chanced another glance in the mirror she'd set up, not recognizing myself. I was glad I'd lost a bit of weight the last six months; I didn't relish the idea of prancing around like this showing off a decidedly un-feline muffin top. There was still a bit of softness around the edges, but my curves were firm enough, and what had aged Abby had managed to disguise with her paint: orange and black melding together seamlessly into tigerish stripes, a blaze of white from my mouth down my throat, cresting along my bare breasts, down my belly to disappear under the thong, which was itself a pale orange, intended to blend with the greater mass of the paint. My face was perfectly adorned in the suggestion of a feline muzzle, whiskers and all, my mouth drawn in gleaming black and my eyes made huge and almond shaped with that same distinctive hue. The blues of my irises were hidden under unnervingly convincing pale gold contact lenses, the pupils correctly round instead of slit. \"They're going to be looking at your stripes, not your tits,\" Abby had insisted. I wasn't so sure.\n\n\"And now for the piece de resistance ... \" Her hands looped a slender silver chain around my waist, a long plush tiger tail depending from the backside, heavy and strangely comforting against the cleft of my ass. Abby tightened the chain, two strands of slack dangling over my left hip, chiming musically as they rang together. She leaned back, studying me critically, then clapped her hands together with an enormous, fiendish grin. \"You look perfect!\" Experimentally she ran a hand down my spine, hard enough to make me yelp. \"And it's not smearing at all! Oh, Kathy, you are going to have *fun.*\"\n\nI scowled. \"I doubt it. I think I'm going to hide in the back of your tent.\"\n\n \"You'll do no such thing. You're going to get out there and prowl. Have fun. Be wild, for once in your life!\"\n\nShe shooed me out of the tent, and I found myself at the edge of a seemingly endless crowd, shivering, my arms crossed over my bare breasts. *I'm too old to be here,* I think at first ... but among the wildly dressed people milling about, laughing, beating drums, passing joints back and forth, and seemingly having the time of their lives, I see quite a few people my age, and some a *lot* older. And more than a few of them are even more outrageously clad than I am. I feel myself blushing under the paint. Slowly I relax my arms and wend my way into the crowd, toward one of the musical pits where a punkish band is playing something loud and energetic. \n\nPeople cheer me. People point -- not laughing, but in delight. One girl remarkably in looks likes Abby feigns terror and I laugh a little, raising my fingers and hooking them, showing off the little black claws Abby pasted over my nails, faking a snarl until I dissolve into self-conscious giggles. The sun beats down on my painted skin and for the first time in ages I feel *freed* and *wonderful*, warmed by the sun in nothing but my skin ... and my stripes, of course. \n\nWidening Gyre takes place in a northeastern river valley, not the desert, and so there are a goodish number of hilly outcroppings for people to camp out on, rocks for a Kat to climb. Feeling adventurous I clamber atop one of them, feeling the air lift my long red mane of hair (carefully clipped to conceal my ears, so the only ears people see are the tufted black tiger ears perking from my scalp). Below me is a circle of nine or ten college students, enthusiastically debating whether Eliot or Pound was the worse anti-semite.\n\n\"Pound,\" I say, authoritatively. They all look up at me, startled, giving into delight as they see the craftsmanship of Abby's paints ... or the crazy naked broad painted as a tiger, whichever. \"Eliot was only an anti-semite as a hobby. For Ezra it was more like a profession.\"\n\n\"Better listen to her,\" says a young man with tumbled jet black hair and keen grey eyes, smiling up at me with total fearlessness. \"Cats would be the experts on Eliot.\"\n\nHe invites me down to the circle, introducing himself as Nash. \"Not Ernest Hemingway on safari?\" I inquire, grinning lopsidedly, bracing down on my hands and knees as if I'm about to pounce. Maybe Abby is right. Maybe I *do* need this.\n\n\"Miss Tigress, even if I had a rifle on me, I wouldn't have the heart to point it at you.\"\n\nI laugh and leap from the rock, landing beside him, catching his shoulders in my pawed hands, the two of us tumbling to the earth, laughing. He's just barely young enough to be my son, but something in his eyes tells me he doesn't care.\n\nLater in his tent, the thong carelessly torn away, our bodies joining in a rhythmic pulse, sweat mingling, the tent explosive with the heat of our bodies, my clawed fingers hooking into his naked chest, riding his cock, crying out against him, mewling, his hands greedy on my ass, one thumb pressed confidently to the tight hole under my tail -- he didn't ask if I'd like that; just knew what it would do to me -- I don't even remember how I got here. Not kissing him, but licking his lips, panting against his throat, lapping up his sweat, sinking my teeth into his skin as my orgasm twists deliciously through me, drawing both a cry from his lips and a hot jet of cum from his cock.\n\nSlowly I relax against him, licking the place I bit. His cock slips easily out of me as my striped hands wander his rangily muscled chest. Abby did her work well -- the stripes haven't run a bit.\n\n\"Is your name really Cat?\" he asks breathlessly, stroking the back of my neck. I lower my head to his chest, delighting in the touch.\n\n\"What else would it be?\" I ask throatily.\n\nHe laughs, uneasy for the first time. \"Could you at least tell me what color your eyes are? I mean ... I know you must not have anywhere to put those lenses ... but I just ... I'd really like to know.\" \n\nI raise my head and peer deeply into his eyes, my own feline irises inscrutable and depthless. \"They're just what they seem to be.\" My tongue darts out and flicks at his mouth.\n\nNash sighs, then smiles ruefully. \"Well, I'm sorry you want to remain anonymous. But tell whoever painted you ... they did incredible work. But they had something incredible to work with.\" He blushes, as if he's not used to such sentimentalism coming from his mouth.\n\n\"I'll tell her.\" I stand up, stretching languidly, shivering as the secret places in my body clench with the memory of him. \"In fact, I should go find her. She's probably looking for me now.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He bites his lower lip. \"I'm going to be here the whole festival.\"\n\n\"So will I.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he says again. \n\nAnd maybe I'll look for him. But right now I want to *prowl*. I blow a kiss -- then make the same clawing gesture I did to the girl earlier. He laughs a little, absently rubbing a place on his chest where I scratched him. \n\nI step out into the night, delighting in the warm summer breeze on my naked skin, savoring the smell of sex that clings to me. It's funny -- I hadn't thought Abby had painted me under the thong, but the stripes and white blaze continue uninterrupted between my legs. She even frosted my little patch of red hair a soft, silky white.\n\nThey've lit the fires. I hear primitive drumbeats like tom-toms, calling all wild things to them. I turn and slink toward the glow of the fires, my eyes reflecting their dancing lights, the tail swaying from the silver chain against my calves, the tip curling and uncurling as if it were alive.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm back again with my favorite prompt. I've done this one a few times, but I always enjoy seeing new takes on it! This will be a fantasy setting (or it could be a modern setting in a world where magic exists I suppose). I will be playing a powerful sorceress, one who travels the world, doing as I please without fear of consequences. If I see a castle I like, I take it. If I meet a man or woman who catches my eye, I take them too. Many have tried to stop me, but all have ended up as entranced slaves in my tower; the women forced to wear slutty transparent dresses and the men either kept naked and used as living sex toys or forced to become femmy little crossdressers. Rumor has it that a few of my slaves are even of royal blood.\n\nAll of that will soon change though, because you've discovered something that nobody believed you'd ever find. A weakness. My weakness. Something that will guarantee you an advantage against me that none of my other challengers have ever had.\n\nBy now you're wondering what that weakness is. Well, this is for you to decide! I'm leaving the exact nature of it wide open, because I'm betting that some of you out there will be able to come up with something really fun and creative! Write me a first post describing your character and the weakness they've discovered (both what the weakness is and how it affects me) as they prepare to challenge me. Try to make it something unique and creative, not just a magic word that instantly makes me completely helpless. I'll also leave it up to you to decide if I'm even aware that I have this weakness or if I'm taken by surprise, maybe not even realizing what the effects are until it's too late!\n\nkinks: humiliation, clothes ripping, slutty clothes, dirty talk, taunting/insults, body writing, (also like discovering new kinks, so feel free to ask!)\n\nlimits: bestiality, toilet related kinks, serious injury (pain and minor injuries are fine but nothing gory or stuff like that)\n\n**Edit: I'll be accepting responses for quite some time, so don't be shy!**",

            "selftext": "Hey again, DPP! After a slight break I'm back - and better than ever.\nBut, being back means I need *more* dick. I want more cocks rubbing against my firm, soccer player bubble butt as I clean the kitchen counter. I want to be doing something on my knees as you walk over and pull out your rock hard dick and rub it on my face. I want to be your waitress that leans over the table and brushes my big tits against your face, maybe even rubbing your bulge in front of your friends - or maybe you can tell I want it, so you just force my head down on it while they all watch. I want to be jacking you off in the pool with all my parents friends around, blissfully unaware of why I keep having to go underwater and come up unusually out of breath. I want you to have no choice but to pin me down and fuck me like the slut I am.\n\nDon't you wish I was your neighbor? I would *definitely* give you a show.\n\nAll in all, I'm just a 21 year old slut that loves to get fucked and loves to RP getting fucked. I'm Addickted. (Hah.)\n\nI'd love to RP with a literate guy who is good at just the right amount of building up and getting to the point. Depends on my mood. The roles I like usually involve older men, but don't hesitate to message me if you're my age! I love all dick. I like: Best friends/boyfriends dad, next door neighbor (married or not), dad's friend/coworker, dad's boss, teacher, handsy customer, gym goer/personal trainer. If you can think of anything else, just mention it!\n\nMy kinks include: Initial DubCon that progresses into consensual, rough sex, riding, public anything (groping, fucking, whatever. I love to be watched most of the time), oral of course, bit of name calling, and cheating. That's all I can think of right now. My mind seems to be drifting elsewhere.\n\nMy kinks do NOT include: scat, bloodplay, NonCon, anal, incest, violence, animals.\n\nIf anything I've said has interested you, I should probably introduce myself! I'm Emily. I'm 5'6 with brown hair and blue eyes. I play soccer whenever I can (I'm a striker) so I would describe my body type as athletic. Well, as athletic as I can be with size 36 DD's. I'm a waitress (hence the handsy customer role) and a college student. I'm on the fairer side skin wise, but I do get pretty tan along with everyone else in the summer.\n\nCum message me! Let me play with you.",

I'm 5'6'', black hair, athletic and hazel eyes. For backwards, yes I wear the hijab. I wear the hijab before you all ask. I'm looking for whatever any of you particularly want to discuss. Honestly I am feeling more chat than RP tonight but, I'm not opposed to it. I also do live in the US. In terms of what I'd like to try honestly, the gentle, romantic stuff is great. the harder stuff like bondage and raceplay also works (and honestly, I might be leaning this way tonight). In terms of what not to do, anything extreme and bathroom stuff and stuff that generally gets posted. I know this is a bit short, again I'm not quite sure what to write.

            "selftext": "My favorite time period in Star Wars is the Great Galactic War and the Cold War that came about it. Those of you who have played the SWTOR MMORPG will know what I'm talking about; speaking of which I usually hate those types of games. You know the types, WoW like games, no offense to those that do its just really not my thing. I focused more on the story aspects more than the combat and multiplayer.\n\nThat sorta leads me into the reason why I'm creating this post. I want to do a roleplay set in either the Great Hyperspace War or the Cold War that spawned from that conflict, I don't have a preference. I'm a huge Star Wars nerd which means I'd be happy to give you a brief run down on the current state of the Galaxy Far Far Away... though having 'Wookieepedia' open in the background wouldn't hurt either.\n\nI have a lot of ideas for this, with a lot of different pairings, though as different as they are they have one thing in common. Femdom. I love it, can't get enough of it; whether it be through simple domestic life or through extremely kinky sex I just can't get enough of it. If you aren't a fan of Femdom I'm sorry to say that this prompt really isn't for you! Now, before you go I do have to add something very important.\n\n*Just because I like Femdom, does not mean I'm against a good story.*\n\nI Ike it when my roleplays are full of action, romance, adventure and sex. Kinky sex to be exact. Which brings me to my point, we have options for what we can play as.\n\nA Darth and her new apprentice.\n\nA Imperial Sergeant and her Republic prisoner\n\nAn Imperial Officer and a hapless Smuggler\n\nAre just a few of the many ideas I got swirling around in my noggin! So please do.t be afraid to message me an idea of yours, along with your kinks and limits so I know what's too much and what takes you straight to the Nut Hut!\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations! Put your favorite time period from Star Wars in your post so I know that you've read this far, let's have some fun!",

Let me tell you how it works.\n\nBy now, we've all experienced tinder to some degree. We've had our successes and our horror stories. But my proposed app comes from a slightly darker angle. This is for the girls our there that want to make their rape fantasies come true, but in a more genuine way than just having their boyfriend pretending to be someone else.\n\nSo it starts the same way as tinder. Guys and girls swiping left and right on the people that they like and dislike. But when there's a match, only the male party gets a notification - the female party never knows when she gets matched up. The app does broadcast her location however, so whether she's at the gym, the store or her house, any of the guys she's matched up with know her whereabouts at all times. It even allows her matches to send her anonymous pictures that they take of her while she's out and about. The teasing and taunting can go on for weeks at a time, totally up to the guy's discretion. Finally, culminating in an authentic rape scene for them both to experience.\n\nI know this is an out-there, far-fetched idea that would never fly in the app store. But I do like talking about it and seeing what you kinky women think of it.",

He funds city-wide projects, funds local elections, and is probably the most powerful non-elected person in the area. And as his youngest daughter, I have grown up knowing nothing but wealth and the finer things.\n\nHis newest project is not going as planned however. He has been investing in property in one of the poorer, more violent parts of town to regenerate it, and has come into conflict with some of the gangs there. A slowly escalating situation is made worse by some poorly chosen words about black people by my Father, and the gangs decide to hit back hard.\n\nThey do this by kidnapping me, along with the girl I am walking with when their van drives past me on the street - I am open to whether this girl is my sister or a friend, but please indicate which you would prefer. They throw us in the van, and take us to their part of town.\n\nWhen my blindfold is removed I am in a warehouse, with a crowd of people surrounding me. There are cameras pointing at me, and the other girl is tied up next to me.\n\nTwenty minutes later, an image is posted on the internet and my Father is sent a link to it. The image shows the two of us with our hands behinds our back, and tape over our mouths, in some kind of warehouse. We are both naked. On either side of us are two muscular black men. They are also naked, and their enormous dicks dangle menacingly between their legs like tree trunks. \n\nThere is also a link to a live feed...\n\nI would like to play as the younger daughter, from the moment our blindfolds are removed. The roleplay will cover the explanation of the situation, the stripping, the taking of that initial photo, and then the utter, obscene, degrading humiliation that follows. I will be spanked, forced to suck cock, fucked in every hole, treated roughly, and made to look into the camera as I am forced to orgasm after orgasm.\n\nAll live on the internet, as a warning to Daddy.\n\nWhile I am interested in forced lesbianism, the focus will still mostly be on me.\n\nIf this would interest you, and if you can **write long, detailed responses without narrating my character's actions**, please please respond! I would add that I would like to set up the RP first, rather than just jumping in.\n\n(I'm also happy to do previous prompts too)",

            "selftext": "(If the prompt is up I\u2019m still looking!)\n\n*Homo minos*, or more commonly referred to as \u201cMinotaurs\u201d, are a race of anthropomorphic bull men that live in tribal communities along rivers, plains, and in the mountains. They stand between 7-9 feet tall, are covered in fur in shades of brown, black, and white, and are covered in muscle mass.\n\nCuriously, the Minotaur have no females among their race, and rely on females of other races for reproduction. Nearly two centuries ago, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the Minotaur to raid isolated villages and make off with their women in the night, but such acts have stopped since then. \n\nNobody who has gone to look for a Minotaur village has ever returned. Some hypothesize that they have all but died out, only a few remaining. Some say that they are able to give birth to female Minotaurs. Me? Well I believe that Minotaurs are actually able to sire female children, but of the mothers race, and reached a stable ratio of males to females to sustain their populations. \n\nI plan to go out, and be the first human to ever come back from a community of *Homo minos*, and tell about it!\n\n_____\n\nHello all! I\u2019m looking to play out a story about a young scholar and her journey to learn about these mysterious bull men. What are their lives like? Are the peaceful? All this I\u2019m looking to discuss with you! You can either play the scholar, a bull, or a whole community!\n\nI\u2019m looking for something long term, and to focus on building a tribe of Minotaurs, describing how they live before we jump in! So be ready to world build.\n\nKinks: Huge bull cocks, sizeplay, musk, filthy sex in the mud, dirty living conditions, sexism, breeding/impreg, casual nudity, free use, pubic hair, mind break, addictive cum/musk, rimming (giving and receiving), harems",

            "selftext": "You were in downright shock when you found my Fetlife profile. It's not that I had made it easy, I didn't reveal my face in any of the risque photos I had posted. You hadn't even known it was me the first few pictures you scrolled through, I was just any other nice pair of tits and ass. Seductive poses and suggestive captions that showed my true self, the naughty slut begging to be controlled. They say true freedom only comes in slavery after all. It was that second rear facing pic that gave my identity away, the one where you could see a peek of my little pink asshole. The dead give away was near my right hip. A tattoo. A quote from Harry Potter to be specific.\n\nQuickly you pulled up my Facebook profile, navigating through until you got my album from July. There. That's where you had seen that tattoo before. In a happy pose with some friends while on vacation, my shirt had rode up, exposing some bare flesh and inked words in the telling Harry Potter font. You looked over all the photos again, this time your cock stiff as a board with this new knowledge.\n\nThe thrill of just knowing my secret was almost enough. *Almost*. But with knowledge comes power. You couldn't resist the call of power this afforded you. If I wanted to be controlled then you were going to give me a real dose of what that meant. No safe words involved.\n\nYou waited with patience the day after you dropped the envelope off in front of my apartment door. The package with all those printed pictures and evidence of every social media account I had to my name. Your threat made clear, you didn't want hush money. No, you wanted control. A small note lay at the bottom of the envelope, a promise with more instructions to come. Your heart nearly skips a beat when I walk into the office that morning. Oh was it apparent. Not to anyone who wasn't looking for the signs, but you were. The tears were gone but the puffy eyelids remained despite my attempt with make-up. I looked tired, like I had been up most of the night with worry. I said my pleasantries, my morning greetings to all, including you but behind my facade was someone troubled. You almost felt sorry. *Almost*.\n\nYou laid out the rules in no uncertain terms in your second contact. Making it clear I followed them or everyone I had ever known would see what a little slut I secretly was. It was a bluff of course. You had no intention of ever releasing those photos or any other information about me. You weren't interested in ruining lives. Not that I would know that. I didn't even have the slightest clue who my blackmailer was.\n\nYou eased me into the arrangement. Too much at once and I might fold. The first week your only request was a morning close up of the panties I was wearing. Your cock would twitch whenever I walked into the office. Often times just 10-15 minutes after sending you the pic. Knowing what lay beneath my skirt or dress when no one else did really got you going.\n\nThe second week you tested your luck at work. Another untraceable text sent, ordering me to take a picture playing with myself. You could see the hesitation on my face from across the room. You wrote out more encouragement. *Just put your other hand under the desk and take the picture quickly. You have 10 minutes.* You watched as I nervously looked around, worried about anyone noticing. You were fast to look back at your computer so I didn't see your eager face. The pic was uploaded to the online album you had made for me, after the third check, you see it's there. You can't hold back though, you have to rush to the bathroom. The quality was terrible of course but that wasn't the appeal, that wasn't what had your dick pulsing so much you had to jerk it then and there in the stall. It was the control, the knowledge of what I had done just feet away and never knowing who it was for.\n\nMore picture requests came, eventually a video too. There was little left of my body that you hadn't seen by week three. But it wasn't enough. You wanted to know my schedule, what my every waking moment was filled with between your demands. What could you do to get closer without revealing yourself yet?\n\n*END PROMPT*\n\nYou get the idea right? You're going to play my co-worker blackmailing me, leading to bolder and bolder demands until you're forced to reveal yourself and convince me this was all for me, this was what I really wanted all along.  I'm looking to do a roleplay only.  \n\nIf it's not closed then it's open.  Even if this is a few hours old, feel free to send a message. Often times I honestly will have not gotten a decent response or something's gone awry after a few hours.\n\nKinks: D/s, restraints, slut shaming, blackmail, romance, masturbation, oral, dub con, facials, forced impregnation, non-con (if done right.  I'm picky on this one.)\n\nLimits: Toilet, violence, incest",
